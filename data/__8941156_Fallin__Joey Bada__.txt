16 ContributorsFallin’ Lyrics
Break

Roses red, violets are blue
I just might cut off all my hoes for you
So what you like? Like, like, a-ha-ha-ha-ha
So what you like? A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

I'm fallin' for you
And I don't wanna catch myself
No, I don't wanna catch myself
And I don't wanna catch myself
I'm fallin' for you
And I don't wanna catch myself (And I don't wanna catch myself)
No, I don't wanna catch myself (No, I don't wanna catch myself)
And I don't wanna catch myself

Comin' down, I feel I'm comin' down
This feels like summer now
I need you to love me now
Won't you love me now?
Comin' down, I feel I'm comin' down (I feel I'm comin' down)
This feels like summer now (This feels like summer now)
I need you to love me now (I need you)
Won't you love me now? (I need you)
You might also like
Fallin' for you (I'm fallin' for you)
I'm all in for you (I'm all in for you)
I'm callin' for you (I be callin' for you)
I'm fallin' for you (I thinks I'm fallin' for you)
Fallin' for you (I'm fallin' for you)
I'm all in for you (I'm all in for you)
I'm callin' for you (I be callin' for you)
I'm fallin' for you

They say all is fair in love and war and I ain't 'fraid to risk it all
Fuck it, if I trip and fall, barely do I miss your call
Safe to say you got me open, miss me, girl, I miss you morе
Soon as you walk through my door, I need your panties on the floor
I swear that you ain't got a flaw
It was lovе at the first time you let me hit it raw
If I shine, then we both shine, but let you shine more
Go above, beyond for her, my machete mi amore
Fuck who you was with before
'Cause you look better next to me, respectfully
Any nigga tryna get to you, he gotta check with me
Girl, that's just the principle, don't try to call that jealousy
I'm tryna start a legacy, add you to my pedigree
Can't you see, I'm—
I'm fallin' for you (Fallin' for you)
And I don't wanna catch myself (Don't wanna catch myself)
No, I don't wanna catch myself (Don't wanna catch myself)
And I don't wanna catch myself
I'm fallin' for you (I said, "I'm fallin' for you")
And I don't wanna catch myself (And I don't wanna catch myself)
No, I don't wanna catch myself (No, I don't wanna catch myself)
And I don't wanna catch myself (Comin', comin' down)

Comin' down (Comin', comin' down), I feel I'm comin' down (Comin', comin' down)
This feels like summer now
I need you to love me now
Won't you love me now? (Comin', comin' down)
Comin' down (Comin', comin' down), I feel I'm comin' down (Comin', comin' down)
This feels like summer now (This feels like summer now)
I need you to love me now
Won't you love me now?

Roses red, violets are blue
I just might cut off all my hoes for you
So what you like? Like, like, a-ha-ha-ha-ha
So what you like? A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha1Embed
