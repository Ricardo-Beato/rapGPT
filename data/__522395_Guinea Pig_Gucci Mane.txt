11 ContributorsGuinea Pig Lyrics
I experiment with drugs I'm a guinea pig
I wallow in the mud I'm a guinea pig
Dirty money, dirty money, man im filthy rich
Im filthy rich, im filthy rich

I could care less what you think of me
So I remember you played less through elementary
They get ragious like kobe but im not in the league
And from morning forever getting money way over seas
You not no O.G. so you can not hit my O.G. weed
Big gucci but LV's all over me, that's irony
So make your top tens I give a fuck where you place me
I got that blue-ray on my deuces come back HD

I experiment with drugs im a guinea pig
I wallow in the mud I'm a guinea pig
Dirty money, dirty money, man im filthy rich
Im filthy rich, im filthy rich

I rolled a half of my blunt in 6 seconds
They say I just broke another world record
I sold your boy a half a chicken and a cherrie
And I pour lean up and don't measure
Bitches say that I'm just pleasure
I told that her trash another bitch treasure
I text my ex my new bitch pussy wetter
See the belt, shoes, and bag I'm getting cheddar

I experiment with drugs im a guinea pig
I wallow in the mud I'm a guinea pig
Dirty money, dirty money, man im filthy rich
Im filthy rich, im filthy richEmbed
