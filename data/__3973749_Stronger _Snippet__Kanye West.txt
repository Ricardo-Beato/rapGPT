4 ContributorsStronger (Snippet) Lyrics
Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Harder, better, faster, stronger

N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now!)
(I need you right now!)

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit

Aww, nah, nah, we can’t give ‘em all that. We can’t give ‘em everything. Graduation is coming—it’s coming, quite soon. The album is getting pushed up as we speak. As I’m speaking right now, the whole building’s going crazy and pushing the album up. They like, “Kanye’s doing drops, let’s push the album up.” You know? The more drops I do, the earlier the album’s gonna come. So just, the more shit I talk, the sooner y’all’ll get the shit.Embed
