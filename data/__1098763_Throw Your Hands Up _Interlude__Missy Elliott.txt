5 ContributorsThrow Your Hands Up (Interlude) Lyrics
Yo, this the Queen Bee
And I came to say a little somethin'
On my girl Missy's shit
Now see I got somethin' to say
That's right, I got a problem
I got a problem wit all y'all muthafuckas out there
That got a problem wit us calling ourselves a bitch
Yeah that's right, I said it muthafucka, bitch! What?
You see, bitch is a strong word
And only strong bitches can use that motherfuckin' terminology
Bitch, ha
I mean... if u can't wear the name, don't try to use it
Shucks

Throw ur hands up if u like to get high
Tim, make a fat beat so we can party all night
If u got beef u gotta take it outside
Throw ur wrists up and lemme see ur ice shine
Throw ur hands up if u like to get high
Tim, make a fat beat so we can party all night
If u got beef u gotta take it outside
Throw ur wrists up and lemme see ur ice shineYou might also likeEmbed
