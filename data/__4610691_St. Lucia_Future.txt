32 ContributorsSt. Lucia Lyrics
Save me
(Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up)
I'm a big dawg (Pluto, I am, yeah)
I give a bad, bad, bad bitch some bands (Bad, bad, bad, bad)
I'm on top floor (Save me)
I'm gettin' cocky
(I can't feel nothing at all
Nothing at all)

I'm a big dawg, I can fuck a bitch out in France now
I give a bad, bad, bad bitch some bands now
I'm on the top floor, young nigga, young nigga stand down (Stand down)
I'm gettin' cocky, treat a good girl like she ran down, yeah
Catch an attitude, I'ma go and fuck your friend now (Fuck your friend now)
I changed the altitude, hoppin' out the Benz now (Benz now)

I got one that's Chinese, she a ten
I made my Hong Kong girls wear snakeskin (Yeah)
I be like Tommy Lee on a Pamela Anderson (Yeah)
I be ridin' with a hundred round drum like a Pakistan
I went and bulletproofed the Porsche Cayenne
I had a rendezvous, I was on an island (Big dawg)
Nipsey made it rain outside, had an umbrella in his hands (Rest in peace)
I sold the dope a triple-double, did the money dance (Russell 'Brook)
I'm in a whole 'nother league when I fuck fans (Mmh)
She should've never got this close to me, I'ma give her a chance (Pluto)
I don't wanna make excuses, but she let me do it in the van (So what?)
I wasn't thinkin' exclusive, probably never see her again (Yeah)
You might also like
I'm a big dawg, I'ma fuck my girl in St. Lucia's (I'm outta here)
I ran a check through a money machine, then I seduced her
I'm on the top floor, young nigga, young nigga stand down
I'm gettin' cocky, treat a good girl like she ran down
Catch an attitude, I'ma go and fuck your friend now
I changed the altitude, hoppin' out the Benz now

My WiFi lit, ten thousand feet off the ground
My bitch play violin, and she made in Cape Town
Found out I cheated on her, she'll still feed me grapes (She'll still feed me grapes)
Tryna fight temptation, something I need to pray about (Yeah)
Tried to talk to the pastor, found out he doin' the same thing
Been havin' a secret relationship on his main thing
He ain't no different from me, young nigga tryna maintain (He ain't no different from me)
I want more clarity, I don't gotta change lanes (I don't gotta change lanes)
I want a stripper, but I'm gettin' tired of the same thing (I'm gettin' tired)
She understand me 'cause I hustle and make it rain, rain
Fucked me so good, I woke up, bought her a plain jane
The beauty of her, these hoes ain't in the same lane (They can't come close)
I'm a big dawg, I'ma fuck my girl in St. Lucia's (What else?)
I'm pourin' Cristal like water, baby, no bullshit (Yeah)
I'm a big dawg, I'ma brrr, spend it, no excuses (Yeah)
Countin' brr like a machine, make the pussy juicy (Yeah)
When she get in the bed, she's amazin' (Amazin')
I got a Mediterranean, I can't save it (I got a Mediterranean)
Pour Cristal on your body when I eat the pussy, yeah
Catch an attitude, I'ma go and fuck your friend now
I changed the altitude, hoppin' out the Benz now
I got one Chinese, she a ten
I made my Hong Kong girls wear snakeskin
I'm pourin' Cristal like water, baby, no bullshit, yeah

I ran a check through a money machine, then I seduced her (Brrt, Freebandz)
I'm a big dawg, I'ma fuck my girl in St. Lucia's
My bitch play violin, and she made in Cape Town
I changed the altitude, hoppin' out the Benz now3Embed
