Y'all feel, y'all feel like that?

They give me, they give me love, they love the Scott
They love how the disc rock, they lovin' the Jac'
No Wi-Fi, we hot spottin', connected the block
Rollin' through the club, we feelin' the love
Iller than my trees, they jockin' my steeze, please
Five hundred degrees, nigga, who hotter than me? (Bitches, yeah)

Y'all feel, y'all feel like that?
Y'all feel, y'all feel like that?

Come and kick back with us
This a new religion, come and have mass with us
Tell me, have you made love to a bachelor-turned-ambassador?
Used to grow up in the backwoods
Come take a ride with the real, it's the last of us
We gon' make them Vogue bitches turn racheter
First task, 'nihilate, you used to laugh at us
Pass the Actavis 'cause a nigga past passivist
Imagine my world of misogyny
Nigga, fuck a, fuck a monogamy
Got her head tipped over the driver's seat
Meet me, don't go tell my mama 'bout this, baby
Hold up, we gon' own the summer
Never, never stressin', no, we always hit the numbers
Cuzzo always stressin', always cuffin' different numbers
Know he tired of makin' shit, you know the streets don't make diplomas
Drunk somethin', tryna find my keys
I find myself lookin' down at the stars, the bees
The stars align, remember when it was Ramadan
Might try a line, might try some crime, might try to dime
But now it's time
Baby, now it's time, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
I get the love and they givin' it up like
I get it, I get it, I get it, love
They love me, they love me, love me long time
I get it, I get it, I get it, love
They love me, they love me, love me long time (Time, time)
I get it, I get it, I get it, love
They love me, they love me, love me long time (Long time, long time)
I get it, I get it, I get it, love
They love me, they love me, love me long time (Long time, long time)

Y'all feel, y'all feel like that?
Y'all feel, y'all feel like that?

It's on fire toni—

The night is too young and the love in the air, it hit me
Follow all the vibes, I'm in every city
Gamble with your life, thinkin' 'bout it woday
Tell ya homie chill tonight, you don't want it with him
We raise our glasses, the madness
The tiny waist, the asses, dancin' in trances
Baby say she ready and we 'bout to find out
Don't be mad that your girl done found 'bout
And we get it
Never lied, rager-fied, on a mission
And they lookin' like they know, but they didn't
Let me slip into my mode, I slip round the notes
Smokin' plenty with tequila, baby
Members of The Rage runway with it
Fashion week in Paris, front row with it
Diamonds always dancin', no bullshittin'
See a Black god on the job, yeah, I'm so winnin'8Embed
