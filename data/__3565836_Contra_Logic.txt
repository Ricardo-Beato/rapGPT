Yeah, yeah
The tunes on here? That shit sound good
Bryson gotta hurry up and send me this verse
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Bitch, I've been blowin' up (Bitch, I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'? (In the beginnin')
I know that they showin' up (Know that they showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin' (When the boy winnin')
No, you do not know enough (You do not know enough)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin' (Life that I'm livin')
You've never been low enough (Never been low enough)
Yeah, I was born at the bottom (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything I'm given now
Bitch, I've been blowin' up (Bitch, I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'?
I know that they showin' up (Know that they showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin'
No, you do not know enough (You do not, you do not, you do not)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin'
You've never been low enough (Never been low)
Yeah, I was born at the bottom (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything I'm given now

Bobby, tell me who really 'bout it
Bitch, I doubt it, not a single person work harder than Bobby
Just wrote a novel, starrin' in a movie
Built another business while you at the party
Ain't one to flex, but yeah I'm finna flex
I just parked that new i8 right next to the Audi
Copped that G-Wagon right there for my shawty
Yeah, now they know the name, yeah, they know Bobby

Yeah, get it like, get it like, get it like, get it like me, nah
Handout, palm up, you cannot get this shit here for free, nah
Bobby done put in that work, you gon' pay me a fee, nah
I said Bobby been livin' that life and you know, I said...

Bitch, I've been blowin' up (Bitch, I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'? (In the beginnin')
I know that they showin' up (Know that they showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin' (When the boy winnin')
No, you do not know enough (You do not know enough)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin' (Life that I'm livin')
You've never been low enough (Never been low enough)

You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin'
You've never been low enough (Never been low)
Yeah, I was born at the bottom (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything I'm given now
Let that bitch breathe
Most of these people can't never ever comprehend all the shit that I've seen
I am polite than a mothafucka, but when I grip that mic I get mean
Come now, you know what I mean
Pepe done got the boy lean
Yeah, you could doubt me, say what you want 'bout me
But I am a rappin' machine
I do this shit for the team, shit for the squad
I'm livin' the dream, yes, I am livin' the dream
Hold up, wait up, just can't believe
Just can't believe that my swag is on another level
Yeah, I keep it G
Matter of fact, I keep it, I keep it, I keep it, I keep it M
Turn that shit upside down, now it's a W
No, no, ain't nobody fuckin' with him
Don't matter who come stand next to me
Once I'm surrounded ain't nobody fuckin' with them
I am the best of the best, of the best
Of the best, of the best, of the best like, Men In Black
Greatest alive, bitch, I've been that
If you don't agree, you get kidnapped
Bitch slapped, thrown back, like woo!

Yeah, get it like, get it like, get it like, get it like me, nah
Handout, palm up, you cannot get this shit here for free, nah
Bobby done put in that work, you gon' pay me a fee, nah
I said Bobby been livin' that life and you know, I said...
Bitch, I've been blowin' up (Bitch, I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'? (In the beginnin')
I know that they showin' up (Know that they showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin' (When the boy winnin')
No, you do not know enough (You do not know enough)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin' (Life that I'm livin')
You've never been low enough (Never been low enough)
Yeah, I was born at the bottom (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything I'm given now
Bitch, I've been blowin' up (Bitch, I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'?
I know that they showin' up (Know that they showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin'
No, you do not know enough (You do not, you do not, you do not)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin'
You've never been low enough (Never been low)
Yeah, I was born at the bottom (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
