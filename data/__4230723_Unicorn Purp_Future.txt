Unicorn
Yeah

Gave that Philippe to that lil' bitty bitch and I made her a monster (Made her a monster)
I can’t address all the issues I'm dealin' with, I’m goin' bonkers (I'm goin' brazy)
You not meetin' up to my criteria, I'm not responsive (I'm not responsive)
We done kidnapped your girl on the low and she been goin' bonkers (She goin’ brazy)
I had apartments filled up with the work, you can go ask Tonya (She gon’ tell you)
I spent twenty G's just on one purse, I’m gettin' at that llama (And that's on God)
I came straight from that motherfuckin' dirt, but then I had conquered this (Then I accomplished this)
I’m on that purp like a unicorn after I came from The Dungeon (Yee, yee)

We can do yachts or we can do jets whenever we luncheon (Yeah, yeah)
We doin' three at a time, no lie, this life is a bungee (Yeah, yeah)
I was damn near out my mind, a nigga wouldn't front me
I had to go and get on my grind, that broke shit haunt me (Yeah, yeah)
I got 'em comin' in all different kinds, flyin' out the country (Flyin' out the, woo)
Filled up a Glock with nothin' but that lead and go get some money (Go get some, woo)
When in Jamaica, I was sippin' on red with my Venezuelan ('Zuelan)
I went and jumped in the pool out the bed with some Saudi Arabians (Woo)
I got 'em comin' in fresh out the boat, they lovin' the caterings (Lovin' that, woo)
We came up piss poor, I had to Tom Brady it (I had to Tom Brady it)
I got some bags just sittin' out in England but I ain't savin' it (But I'm not savin' it)
She got that Boston, Massachusetts, I'ma Mercedes it (Massachusetts)
She go'n and sellin' it, prostitution, but I ain't hatin' it (But I ain't hatin' it)
I got the models comin' by the fews, I hope you relatin' it (Hope you relate)
After I made her tie my shoes, I made her my favorite (Tie my shoes)
Everything we did exclusive, ain't no way fakin' it (Everything exclusive)
Fifty million on one play, that's how we be makin' it (Fifty million)
And I came up out the red clay, it ain't no debatin' it
And I got diamonds in the face, you can feel the a-radiance (Feel the a-radiance)
And I got some fine shit on the way, I think she Israelian (The she Dubai, yeah)
Last year, we bought an AK, every single day, we did (Every single day, we did)
All this shit, take to your grave, a nigga ain't sayin' shit (Niggas ain't, shh)
Dot 40 knock down an elephant if he a maniac (Bah-bah-bah)
Nigga gon' squeeze and load out the clip and open one more at that (Open one more cap)

I came straight from that mothafuckin' dirt, but then I had conquered this (Then I had conquered this)
I'm on that purp like a unicorn after I came from The Dungeon

Millions on millions on millions, I been goin' brazy since came out the dungeon (Yee)
I put the stick in his head and it came out the guts and it came out the stomach (Yee)
I put this dick in her pussy, then I fucked this bitch, beat it up, ba-da-bum, bitch (Yee)

I make it rain like I'm Pedro (Pedro)
Tacos and equal dinero ('Nero)
I'm takin' care of her stilettos (Stilettos)
All of her hair and her clothes
I met this girl and I told her to sit on my sack, let me play with her buns (Yeah)
I met this girl out the ghetto, then I can't compare her to none of you runts (Yeah)
Right on the jet out to LA, we smokin' Gelato, but I want some Runtz (Some Runtz)
454 on the freeway, it feel like my C-Day, I got me two sluts (Two sluts)
I put some ice in the Patek, new Richard Mille, I'm at the top like an attic
Hot like a skillet, fuckin' on one of the baddest, carat inside of her titty
Gave that Philippe to that lil' bitty bitch and I made her a monster (Yeah, yeah)

I came straight from that mothafuckin' dirt, but then I had conquered this (Then I had conquered this)
I'm on that purp like a unicorn after I came from The Dungeon
