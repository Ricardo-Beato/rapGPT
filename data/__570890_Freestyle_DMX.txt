4 ContributorsFreestyle LyricsUh, uh, uh
Niggas getting trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Sucking my dick so hard, I'm busting in they mouth
And then I snuff em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid
Slid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where are they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits, and pieces are all that's that left
Niggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfucking breath
Til I pass, cause they asked/ass, and I smelled 'em
The s-p-e-l-l-e-d t-h-e-m, I spelled em
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shotty, pump up one dead
Red alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work
To skirts, like a jag on the merk, arf
Night time is the right time for creeping
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleeping
I been off the deep end, since I was semen
That's why now, I'm such a motherfucking demon!
Screaming, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off
A couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven
That's about eleven hundred as of now
How-can-one-man-kill-so-many-and
The-sin-be-plenty-before-the-age-of-20 *sing-song like nice and smooth*
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot
Fat Goose leather jackets, I bag it, along with
The jewels smacking tools out the hands of fools
On the strength that they don't know what they holding
Niggas caught me tail end cause the weight that I be sewing
Shit up cause I get up, off my ass and skate
Making more moves than u-haul, from state to state
I speak the great, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, "the fuck is you be sniffing?
Cause when it come to riffing, I am the riff raffin
Gots to say nutting, niggas know they get had

Got them all for you baby I got them all
