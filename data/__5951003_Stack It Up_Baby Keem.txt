7 ContributorsStack It Up Lyrics
Amen

I stack it up when I'm down
I stack it up when I’m low, when I get it I go
I stack my Balmain jeans
I stack my denim jeans
When you see it you know
I feel like rich man wins, I might just ball again, like anything goes
I might just call a friend
I might just call a friend
I stack it up when I'm down
I stack it up when I'm low, when I get it I go
I stack my Balmain jeans
I stack my denim jeans
When you see it you know
I feel like rich man wins, I might just ball again, like anything goes
I might just call a friend
I might just call a friend

Yeah
All y’all can learn from me
Her heart, it burn for me
I get it, I go
She just bird to me
She stop my salary, so I let go
I let go all the pain
I might just ball again (Woah, woah)
These bitches call again
I might just call her friend
Anything goes
Anything goes when you good
Anything goes when the hood
Turn the kid up
Turn the kid up 'til you good
Made me help someway I could
These bitches be out
I just be counting my money
I met Obama this summer
I want the Benz
I want the Benz and the hummer
These bitches be fallin' like lumber

Yeah, ayy
I stack it up when I'm down
I stack it up when I'm low, when I get it I go
I stack my Balmain jeans
I stack my denim jeans
When you see it you know
I feel like rich man wins, I might just ball again, like anything goes
I might just call a friend
And I might just call a friend
I stack it up when I'm down
I stack it up when I'm low, when I get it I go
I stack my Balmain jeans
I stack my denim jeans
When you see it you know
I feel like rich man wins, I might just ball again, like anything goes
I might just call a friend
And I might just call a friend, I stack it up when I'm down
I stack it up when I’m low, when I get it I go
I stack my Balmain jeans
I stack my denim jeans
When you see it you know
I feel like rich man wins, I might just ball again, like anything goes
I might just call a friend
And I might just call a friendEmbed
