Grrt, pow, pow, pow
Free the fuckin' members, nigga
RJ, Dafi, SP, Kigz
All o' them, nigga
Don't fuck around, nigga
Woo, woo, grrah, grrah
Big 092, look, woo

Throwin' like Brady, don't be the receiver (Brr, pow)
Dropped outta school, makin' more than my teacher (Dickhead, dummy)
How that's your wifey? For me she a eater
If it ain't Dior, then Gucci the sneaker (Woo, woo)
That boy too soft, he gon' talk in the precinct

I'm with the demons, no hidin', we seekin' (Brr)
Send that boy up, catch the flight on the weekend
Stay on alert 'cause I know they be creepin' (Woo)
Brady, look, gang
It's just me and Pop, don't need nobody else
'Cause that'd be a extra witness
Movie get shot, them bullets put weight on his chest
No this ain't Planet Fitness
I'm tryna beat the box, 1942, I feed her shots (Woo, woo)
And you know how we tease the opp, drop a check, I make him see it drop (Yeah, yeah)
And she drive the boat (Drive), dick in her mouth and I'm all in her throat (Shake it)
Ask your girl, I'm the goat (Facts), can't name one time, you run up, I ain't throw (Woo)
Bitch, it's Dread Woo, you know I get racks (Woo, yeah)
Tell 'em get back (Woo)
He getting flipped, thought it was a pack (Hold on, facts)
He ain't make it back (Uh)
I call up Shank, know he movin' tact (Woo, burner)
Totin' on a strap (Woo)
Who these niggas dressed in all black? (Grrt, baow, baow)
Huh, yo, Pop, them niggas cap (Cap)
You might also like
Yo, Pop, what the fuck is crackin', my nigga? I see you
Hold on, hahaha, goin' crazy here
Hold on, woo

Look, I'm like, "Who that nigga?" (Who that nigga?)
Talkin' 'bout "What's stackin', what the fuck is up?"
Huh? You ain't one of us
You lookin' dirty, nigga, you ain't one of us, nah
I come from the bottom where niggas keep ninas tucked (Huh, brrt, brrt)
We don't stop shots till the sun is up (Get that nigga)
I pass Dafi the chop', that's a give an' go (Woo, baow)
Keep five stones in his head like a mineral
He put pep at his head like a Mento (Brrt)
.38 punching like Kimbo (Grrt, pow, pow, pow)
When you talkin' to me, bitch, remember I'm a giant (Giant)
I dropped outta school, I'm defiant (Uh)
A hater, stealer and a liar (Facts)
But in the jungle, I'm a lion (Rrr)
Now they see me on a flyer (Brrt, brrt)
They like "Pop, you on fire" (Fire)
I really just bought the new LaFerrari
RD like, "Send me the wire" (Woo, woo)

Yeah, skrrt, yeah, grrt, baow, haha, woo, woo
Throwin' like Brady, don't be the receiver (Brr, nah, pow)
Dropped outta school, makin' more than my teacher (Dickhead, dummy)
How that's your wifey? For me she a eater
If it ain't Dior, then Gucci the sneaker (Woo, woo)
That boy too soft, he gon' talk in the precinct

Niggas watchin' like the Rollie (Watch that)
Switch the VIN on the stoley
Same nigga to the grave
Gotta watch them, Mille topless
Got the white like Milonakis
I'm in traffic, say "What's rockin'?"
You hear me? Fuck, huh, ready
Try to shave the wave off a BO, huh
Shorty shaped like she Creole
It's fuck parole, fuck a CO
I'm outta town while Haitians eatin' griot
I'm back uptown with the papis
More white than a Nazi
Big wheel still I duck the paparazzi (What)
No time for no limelight
And I'm fresh to death like it's prom night
Fuck them niggas on the other side
Only friend I got, he a dead guy
If you talk about him then the lead (Fly)
Niggas they act like they know me, huh
Two fours on 'em like Kobe
Don't play with that lefty, he shoot like Ginóbili
Yeah TRAV' always tweaking
I ride with some apes and I'm never on defense
I'm preein' these niggas, the way that they envy
Don't talk 'bout my money, but I'm stackin' plenty
Foreign bitches givin' minds in a Bentley
Been trappin' all day, man, I just hit a ten-piece
Fuck a Uber, threw that bitch in the renty (Woo)
Throwin' like Brady, don't be the receiver (Brr, pow)
Dropped outta school, makin' more than my teacher (Dickhead, dummy)
Hot as your wifey, for me she a eater
If it ain't Dior, then Gucci the sneaker (Woo, woo)
That boy too soft, he gon' talk in the precinct (Watch that)3Embed
