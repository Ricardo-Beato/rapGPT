I'm riding down Bouldercrest, and the car ain't even out yet
My neck cost your click, label deal and your whole check
Waves in my temp fade got ya bitch lovesick
Homosexual faggot niggas Man y'all on that fuck shit
Bought a 'rarri and another rarri, spent the fucking budget
I just played the card that I was dealt don't cut man, I just rumble
They say that Gucci n'd dem be running dope on cokeboys running numbers
If your money's not a problem then we got something in common
It's like them commas keep on coming to me, running, running, running to me
When I pass I stick my hand out, told your ho don't run that money to me
You gotta pay 'fore you lay me, I got foreign bitches tricking on me
Yellow rollie pay attention, red Bentley, Robert Griffin

Mention me, mention mention me
How you mention hustling nigga you ain't mention me
Mention me, mention mention me
How you mention trapping nigga you ain't mention me
Mention me, mention mention me
How you mention pimping bitch you ain't mention me
Mention me, mention mention me
How you mention gooning nigga you ain't mention me

You might also likeGucci Mane perverted, my reputation shit you heard it
Do not disturb on the door, because your girlfriend getting murdered
My watch cost a birdie, and a birdie, and a birdie
All this Burberry clothing got your girlfriend nervous
Presidential Kush behind a Maybach curtain
Got 10 shooters with me like the secret damn service
And I pitch that dope, I pitch that dope, my bitch so curvy
They call me ?? how I microwave work it
In that thang and it's dirty when it's clean, when it's clean
Got a green and some lean, when she jump out it's a dream
Yella yachtmaster on me, I'm eating some lemon pepper wings
And I don't ever turn down, think this shit a game?
