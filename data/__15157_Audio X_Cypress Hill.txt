6 ContributorsAudio X Lyrics
"T-Minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.. zero!"
Blast off

Come inside, hello everybody, welcome
Think you better be ready for the battle when the shit goes down
'Cause we warrin'
All you fuckin' yellow comets runnin' from the front line
If anybody wanna get away, hey
I'll find your fuckin' ass in due time
Run and seek shelter but you never will escape
Flipping over the gate, 'cause you can't wait
To get your fuckin' ass away
But you're trapped, and there's no way out of this mushroom cloud
But you never wanna realize that I'm planted
In your mind now
Cypress Hill compound, you could hear the sound
Let another motherfucker run up
And I'll put your ass down (down)
Then I'll peal from your cap the Cypress Hill star
Quick look around, you can't hide
You just might die right where you are

Audio X - We're gonna your blow your head up (up)
Synthetic flows, they gonna make you get up (yeah)
Give me any record and I'll flip it any style (style)
Niggas can't help it, cause they bumpin the shit loud
You might also like
Aiyyo whasup kid, feel the rush, glad you kept in touch
With these niggas who be puffin' on the Dutch
Bustin' guns, lay back in the cut
Can it be, it's just a dream when you're on your scene smokin' the green
'Cause ain't shit never what you think it seem
From the streets where life ain't cheap
Cypress Hill, Soul Assassins, while you askin' "Who that rappin'?"
We get all up inside your grill, with the skill
Shoot to kill when it's time for action
See you can't hide, from this homicide, that ain't no lie
Better kiss that black ass goodbye
When you try to play these wise guys
So who's complaining when we intensify the levels on the rhyme
You better get ready for the battle when the shit goes down
Because we are the wild

Audio X - We're gonna your blow your head up (up)
Synthetic flows, they gonna make you get up (yeah)
Give me any record and I'll flip it any style (style)
Niggas can't help it, cause they bumpin' the shit loud

Audio terrorists
Mic specialists
About to blow this
Blast off
Lookin' in your eyes, I see your body bag figure
Better be ready for the battle when the shit goes down
'Cause it's on nigga
What you wanna do, you better pay close attention
Let it be known, I control the zone
Beyond your comprehension
Blunt session, you feel the tension begin to rise
Fuck and feed him, if they can't take a joke
And get high
I'm feelin lye, in my lungs, what the deal bro?
So many people wanna hit my joint
But they never got none
Imagine that bullshit, happens all the time
Niggas better start growin' they own
They cannot fuck with mine
Give me any record and I'll flip it any style
Beginners better run back to the lab
And practice for a while

Audio X - We're gonna your blow your head up (up)
Synthetic flows, they gonna make you get up (yeah)
Give me any record and I'll flip it any style (style)
Niggas can't help it, cause they bumpin' the shit loud
