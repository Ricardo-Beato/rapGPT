New shoes with the blue suede
Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede
Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses

Bitches ain't shit but hoes, I been known this
Niggas gon' snitch regardless, Mitch showed us
Never gon' switch, my momma raised soldiers
Show me that profit, cough them Rang Rovers
Up, I'm up now, these hoes all in love now
Wanna fuck now, they beg to bend over
Half these hoes chauffeurs, half these hoes useless
Fucked the face toothless, easy, so ruthless
Ask where he from then leave his dome roofless
Sweet Chin Music kick back, gruesome
Watch out for Judas, Vice and G Unit
5-0 fucking with the yayo too
L-B-P-D get sprayed on too
Always keep it GC, ask my homies for the proof
Blowing 40s as a youth, Thump Deuce in the Chevy
Hit the corner, run up on him, turn a nigga to Spaghettios
You might also like
New shoes with the blue suede
Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede
Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses

Bitches ain't shit but tricks, I been known that
Blowing on dicks for spliffs and cold Cognac
Out club hoppin', hoppin' in Kodak's
Where the coke at? Love white like Bobby wife
Finna party like it's prom tonight
Finna kill a nigga walkin' to his momâ€™s tonight
Shit real in the field, get caught, don't squeal
Best deal that the judge finna offer: life
Play this track in Calipat, get it poppin' in the prison
And play this shit in Ironwood where my little brother livin'
Live or die for the whoopin' or the Crippin', pick a side
Death row, till they put you in the Pikachu to fry
That's life, three strikes, that's life
Three hoes, half dyke, this can be a long night
Long road to the riches, bravos from the bitches
Coulda' been a felon selling nickels off of Linden
Nigga, fuck that
New shoes with the blue suede
Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede
Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses

All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em
Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em67Embed
