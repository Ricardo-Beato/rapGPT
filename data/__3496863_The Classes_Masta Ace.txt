2 ContributorsThe Classes Lyrics
So this is your first year, right?

Yeah

It's my second year
So I'm pretty familiar with the course catalog
And the teachers and stuff
Let me see your schedule
What are you-
What kind of classes are you taking?

Got a little bit of everything

Let's take a look here, okay
They gave you trainbombing at eight in the morning?
Kinda' early, you'll be walking around
With paint on your hands all day long
Let's see here, Bronx history at 09:30
Street Promo with Mr. Thompson, a jerk
Rap Cinema, that's a fun class
You might also like
What's that-
What's that about?

Basically you just watch movies all day
Krush Groove, Wild Style, Beat Street
Easy A

Alright, what's this shit right here?
What's this class?

Oh okay, MPC 101
They gave you that your first semester?
I never took it but I hear it's a monster
They teach you about using samplers
They go through the whole manual
Chapter by chapter
Then on the final exam you've gotta' make a beat
They grade you on how good the beat soundsEmbed
