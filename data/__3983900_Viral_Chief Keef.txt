Make you viral, make you viral
Make you viral, make you viral
Make you viral, make you viral

Hello world, how you?
If you got a price we could buy you, ayy
If I was your boss, I'll fire you, ayy
You say you wanna travel, I'll fly you, ayy
Don't make me and my dogs come and find you, ayy
You can call me rich but I ain't Lionel, ayy
I told her when the cops come give a signal, ayy
CaWop in the cut, he make you viral, bang bang

These hoes be tryna kick it, no Taekwondo, ayy
Yellow bitch wit' me look albino, ayy
Nigga go long, we throwin' spirals, uh
Chief Sosa a psychic slash psycho, uh
What's on my mental reveal, no tomorrow, uh
I think I see a light at end of tunnel, uh
I swear these hoes be suckin' me like it's normal, ayy
Got flavored lube for your lil bitch and it taste like caramel, ayy
I'm the king of the jungle, ayy
No WWE, but let's get ready to rumble, ayy
Fuck a lil bitch so good she wanna cuddle, ayy
She thought I was that tired, I had to bust a lil bitch bubble, ayy
But you dancin' to your uber lil bitch like Usher, uh
And if it's "Fuck me" then ya know it's "Fuck ya", uh
Hop on a plane for a bitch, can't blink, I'ma rush ya, uh
The watches I wear ain't never on fakewatchbusta, uh (Make you viral)

Can you hear me? Bitch, we ridin' 'round Philly, totin' them frisbees, ayy
Just bumped into a bad bitch and her name Mackenzie, ayy
In a SRT witg my watch, it cost a Bentley, ayy
The law hate hate the intouchables, yeah
And my pockets ten times look duckable, hmm, yeah
Came in so fuckin' fast like a thunderbolt, hmm, yeah
Ayy lil weak nigga pass me the tuckable, hmm, yeah
And you know you gotta spend them racks and get it back, hmm, yeah
And I hate Chief Sosa, I'ma kill his ass, uh, well
Three point shot with the Glock, Tadoe with the pass, uh, yeah
I feel like Rocko got a Gift Of Gab, uh, yeah
Never handle a lil bitch off Instagram like ugh-ugh
I was doin' too much, I had to take a breath like huh-huh
Put a silencer on the rifle, buh-buh
On her toes, if you feel froggy then jump-jump
Hittin' service, you can call me Forrest Gump
First couple mill, I went and bought forty guns, and that's facts
I ain't talkin' drank when I say "I'm givin' bitches the Act", ayy
I'm prolly somewhere laced in the back of the back, ayy
I ain't have no hobby in school, no ball no track, ayy
Bitch wanna talk a lil bit but I'm callin' her back, ayy
Hang up on her then text my phone dead (Make you viral)
