14 ContributorsWit It Lyrics

That business, I'm wit it, I'm wit it, I'm wit it
Talkin' shit, you can get it
Talkin' all this shit and we gon' fuck around and split it
Nigga, I'm wit it, you thought I wasn't wit it? I'm wit it
I'm wit that shit, don't forget it
Make you mess up your sentence
I'm wit it, I'm wit it, I'm wit it
I'm wit it, I'm wit it
Bitches on bitches, got bitches on bitches, I don't need 'em
I get it, I get it, but I get it, I get it
I get it  I'm wit it, I'm wit it
I'm wit it, I'm wit it

Whatcha got in your pockets boy? I spent that on some paintball guns
Crash the party, in this bitch its crackin just like the limos was
You ain't gotta find me, bitch I ain't lost, do I look like Nemo, cus?
Ditty Boppin' with the Glock, you run around dancin', do I look like Kemo, blood?
I be ridin' in traffic, gettin' to that cabbage
I don't want romantic, I don't wanna smash it
I ain't got no pops, I'm a bastard
Member on the block, I was young living savage
I don't want no friends, I can't trust these nigga
Y'all niggas soo funny, I don't wanna be laughin'
She said she like my chain, she grab it
If a nigga wanna smoke then we ready
I be coolin' at my home, I be gettin' that dome
I ain't no want no dilemmas bitch, I ain't no Nelly
Gimme a second, lemme play this R Kelly
Then you bump and grind your face on my muthafuckin' belly
Got hella Moncler's, bitch I come from pelly
Bitch, I come from the projects, come from the belly of the beast
That gun talk shit don't scare me
"Sosa can you see?" I be like, "barely!"
You might also like
That business, I'm wit it, I'm wit it, I'm wit it
Talkin' shit, you can get it
Talkin' all this shit and we gon' fuck around and split it
Nigga, I'm wit it, you thought I wasn't wit it? I'm wit it
I'm wit that shit, don't forget it
Make you mess up your sentence
I'm wit it, I'm wit it, I'm wit it
I'm wit it, I'm wit it
Bitches on bitches, got bitches on bitches, I don't need 'em
I get it, I get it, but I get it, I get it
I get it  I'm wit it, I'm wit it
I'm wit it, I'm wit it

At my concerts, hoes be goin' wild, goin' in, goin' out
Pounds of the skunk, I'mma pour it out
16 ounces of the Tech pourin' out
In the sprite, I'mma "six four" it out
Coolin in Cali they be six four'in out
Racks in my pocket, I done tour it out
Inhale smoke then I blow it out
Say she wanna play ball, we can blow it out
Say you wanna fight? KO it out
Say she wanna get it, we can go no for no
Word for word or play no it out
Pulled in, get that guap, then I'm pullin' out
Hoes think I wanna know where her puttin' out
I don't wanna know shit, bitch better lookin' out
For the cops and the ops, that be lookin' out
I'm in the inside and I'm lookin' out
You on the outside and you lookin' in
I ain't gotta be a crook again
I'm rich as fuck, I ain't gotta cook again
Posted on the block, puttin' in
Now rich as fuck and I ain't puttin' in work
Gettin' clean money, 'member when I was gettin' it dirty
That business, I'm wit it, I'm wit it, I'm wit it
Talkin' shit, you can get it
Talkin' all this shit and we gon' fuck around and split it
Nigga, I'm wit it, you thought I wasn't wit it? I'm wit it
I'm wit that shit, don't forget it
Make you mess up your sentence
I'm wit it, I'm wit it, I'm wit it
I'm wit it, I'm wit it
Bitches on bitches, got bitches on bitches, I don't need 'em
I get it, I get it, but I get it, I get it
I get it  I'm wit it, I'm wit it
I'm wit it, I'm wit it2Embed
