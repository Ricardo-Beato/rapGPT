21 ContributorsSay a Prayer Lyrics
Let's go, haha, tick tick
Six spots, twelve stoves, and I need more pots
And I tote more knots than a Boy Scout got

The junkies say it’s finger lickin’ how I whip up powder
I took your food and Prada shoes and added me more power
And if you bought some Sour Diesel, then your dream gone sour
I treat your shooters like cowards, make your team look sour
I feed the hood with the bowl like I cook clam chowder
RIP to Steve McNair, that boy right arm was a rifle
I would race you for the car, but look you don't got the title
If you ain't made ten mil, I can't call you my rival
I got your baby mama suckin' on me using saliva
I made the Forbes list bitch, man you just a subscriber
My mam say you just a lyin’ ass, conniving lil’ diver
My nigga killed his own brother, seen that shit in the bible
Man, Joe Blow chose the fork but you chose the screwdriver
I may did never steal a car, but I did cash off on nine of them
I go so hard I make you dump your whole roster to sign me
And you can find me in the six with all my shooters behind me

I’mma say a prayer, get a blessing today (amen)
No grey hair, I ain’t stressin’ the case
Make you scratch for the chase, I invested in yay
Man what else can I say? I’m still gon’ flex in they face
What the fuck can I say? I got racks in the safe
Get wrong that gat on my waist, that house they trap in that place
Leaning so hard on the drank, I forgot what to say
Never forget where I came, and it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way
You might also like
That right too, I’m having my way
By the bay, I move, penthouse by the lake
They cool, my neighbors, got a gate so you know them folks safe
Got a pool, twelve acres, and a guest house if you wanna stay
Man I’m cool, gettin’ paper, and a custom Cartier
I’m a smooth operator, I got a customer named Sade
And she’ll bug a motherfucker all day, then try to pull up in all grey
I ain’t gon’ play with you, I’m impatient too, ain’t gon’ wait for you
I’m pimpin’ like players do, lean and matching gator shoes, the windbreaker hater proof
Nigga lookin’ nervous, Gerber, soft like baby food
Okay cool, I got a plug like no other
No discussion, me and Thugger, waiting on judgement

I’mma say a prayer, get a blessing today (amen)
No grey hair, I ain’t stressin’ the case
Make you scratch for the chase, I invested in yay
Man what else can I say? I’m still gon’ flex in they face
What the fuck can I say? I got racks in the safe
Get wrong that gat on my waist, that house they trap in that place
Leaning so hard on the drank, I forgot what to say
Never forget where I came, and it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way
I’mma say a prayer, get a blessing today (amen)
No grey hair, I ain’t stressin’ the case
Make you scratch for the chase, I invested in yay
Man what else can I say? I’m still gon’ flex in they face
What the fuck can I say? I got racks in the safe
Get wrong that gat on my waist, that house they trap in that place
Leaning so hard on the drank, I forgot what to say
Never forget where I came, and it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way
Oh, Never forget where I came
And it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way
Oh, Never forget where I came
And it’s all ‘cause I’m having my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh12Embed
