38 ContributorsEmbers Lyrics
Yeah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Sit and watch the embers, claw marks on the sleeve
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave
I realize there are no answers to rid me of this cancer
Still I really gotta leave, see I really gotta leave
Float in a sea of emotions, taken over by fatigue
I told you I had to leave, I told you I had to leave
Hold my hand in heaven, count the heartbeats and count the seconds
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave

Sit and watch the embers, claw marks on the sleeve
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave
I realize there are no answers to rid me of this cancer
Still I really gotta leave, see I really gotta leave
Drown in a sea of emotions, taken over by fatigue
I told you I had to leave, I told you I had to leave
Hold my hand in heaven, count the heartbeats and count the seconds
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave

Yeah, oh, woah, woah, woah
I told you I had to leave
I told you I had to leave
No, hmm-mm
Mmm-mm
I'm happy when I'm alone (Mmm-mm)
Thank you ladies and gentlemen, byeYou might also like9Embed
