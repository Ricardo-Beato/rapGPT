Plugged in
Lil Uzi Plugged in

I got plugs nigga, like what you need?
Yeah I got plugs nigga with the recipes
Yeah I got plugs nigga, like what you need?

(Tell her, tell her)
(Tell her, tell her)

I got anything you need to call my phone
Got 40 licks and 20 bricks thats at the most
I'm sipping lean, I love codeine, she giving throat
About my bread now get this work right off the boat
Plugged in never worry bout them sucka niggas
And I'm the type that probably fucked your mother nigga
And you the type that probably shoot your brother nigga
I swear to God thats why I cannot trust a nigga

What? What? I'm the number one stunner
Tell her hater eat a dick this my summer
I was waiting on pretending gotta love em
Got every single bitch, yeah I'm John Tucker

I see the problem, you should never wife a ho (No)
The sneakers I got on not even a stores
I like designer and my bitch she like the couture
I grabbed the chopper, wait, who at my front door?
And  put my money in a drawer
I kick that ho out cause I swear I'm getting bored
I'm off the lean I'm about to pour me up some more
I'm off the lean I'm about to pour me up some more

Yeah I got plugs nigga with the recipes
Yeah I got plugs nigga, like what you need?
I throw my elbow like I'm Master P
Yeah I got plugs nigga with the recipes
Yeah I got  nigga, like what you need?

I got bitches on me from Atlanta, cool like a fan
Fuck a nigga up, nigga like quicksand

Yeah I got all this money like what the fuck you saying?
