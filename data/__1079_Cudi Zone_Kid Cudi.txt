Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you canâ€™t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere
You might also like
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all


In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all81Embed
