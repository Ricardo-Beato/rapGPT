12 ContributorsNight Like This Lyrics
1017
Night like this, on a night like this
On a night like this? On a night like this
On a night like this? On a night like this
On a night like this? On a night like this
I did that on a night like this, get car jacked on a night like this
I don't wanna dab and I might run up wit a scrap
You might get whacked on a night like this
On a night like this? Yeah, my nigga, on a night like this
On a night like this?

On a night like this a nigga might get killed
Whack that nigga, give his ass the whole clip
Might send a bitch to attract that nigga
Tease that nigga, distract that nigga
Run off on the third, get killed on the fifth
Hit him in the head with the damn four fifth
Met him at the club, he was smoking that piff
Shot him in the head, he didn't leave no tip
Got lean in the car, can't take no sip
Can't lean, can't walk, can't crawl, can't limp
One of them nights he don't get right, done fixed your face then your ass get killed
That's what you get tryna act all stiff
Coming up the hill too swift, I whip one
Blood or crip, give a damn, I hit one
If you don't have a gun then you better go get one
One of them nights when I don't wanna fight
Put your hands on me and I'm ending your life
Sit to my left 'cause you know that ain't right
Call me Tyron 'cause you know that ain't right
I'm the type of nigga that get in a fight by the end of the night
They be reading my rights
I got the right to shoot your ass on sight, I got the right to put an end to your life
If they rob you once, they'll rob you twice
You a pussy ass nigga, you ain't 'bout that life
You might also like
On a night like this, on a night like this
On a night like this, man, a nigga get killed on a night like this
(808 Mafia)
On a night like this, on a night like this
On a night like this, I kidnap your wife on a night like this
Car jack me a nigga, on a night like this, on a night like this
Might whack me a nigga, on a night like this, on a night like this (Flocka)
Put them goons on you nigga, they be in your house on a night like this (Squad, uh-huh, where he at? Where he at?)

On a night like this you could lose your life (Uh-huh, where he at? Where he at?)
On a night like this you could lose your life
Most my niggas rock red, some rock blue
Backdoor nigga, leave 'em sick, bird flu (Quickie)
Sell 'em in the tooth, next flick buy it cool
You saying fuck me, pussy nigga, no, fuck you (Word)
I'm still selling nigga on the blocks with rocks (Squad)
Rule number one: don't fuck with the cops (Riverdale)
Fifty for a show, eighty-thousand for the watch (Flex)
I'm a real game spitter, shawty slicker than a fox (Haha)
With a phone call, boy, I can get you hit (Brrt)
My niggas hold pistols like they legit (Bow, bow, bow, bow)
Send them killer at your ass, better hope they miss
You ain't 'bout that life, you just popping shit
I see through the mist all the snakes in the grass (Uh-huh)
Dropped out of school, still above my class (Flex)
Real right now, even realer in my past (Real, real, nigga)
You don't like what I become, shorty kiss my ass
I'm my own boss, that's why these niggas mad (Boss)
Phantom ghost, paid it all cash, that's why they mad
Haha, squad, squad, squad, Flocka
On a night like this, on a night like this (Uh-huh)
On a night like this (Uh-huh), man, a nigga get killed on a night like this (Bwah)
On a night like this, on a night like this (Get ya rich)
On a night like this, I kidnap your wife on a night like this (Go broke, hit a lick)
Car jack me a nigga, on a night like this, on a night like this (You know)
Might whack me a nigga, on a night like this, on a night like this (You know)
Put them goons on you nigga, they be in your house on a night like this (Blaww)Embed
