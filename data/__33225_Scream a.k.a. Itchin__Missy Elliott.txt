8 ContributorsScream a.k.a. Itchinâ€™ Lyrics
Music

I met him in the Bahamas, I love that nigga per-sona
Smoke that nigga marijuana, get freaky, call me Madonna
Lay on the bed he follow, bone him until to-morrah
Make him sing high sopran-ah, ah
Fifty-fo'-fifty-fifty, Mr. Act-Super-Kinky
Baby, what you gon' get me is some rings for my lil' pinkie
Money will multiply, 'fore you run up inside
Make me all weak and tired, mhm

You got to (Scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin' it up
You got to, got to (Scream)
Pour mimosas in the cup, then you watchin' people buzz
You got to, got to (Scream)
If you from out of town, you think you're holdin' it down
You got to, got to (Scream)
You got to, you got to

He say he from Puerto Rico, he told me to call him Chico
Freakin' up in the Nico, my ego got really negro
Throw the heat, go easy though, though I'm like dice in cee-lo
Makin' heads scream and moan, send 'em back home
Boy, is really worth it just to get dirty dirty?
Give me the liquor liquor, make me talk slurry slurry
Yeah, money will multiply, 'fore you come up inside
Get me all weak and tired, mhm
You might also like
You got to (Scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin' it up
You got to, got to (Scream)
Pour mimosas in the cup, then you watchin' people buzz
You got to, got to (Scream)
If you from out of town, you think you're holdin' it down
You got to, got to (Scream)
You got to, you got to

He asked could he rock my body, he also asked could he buy me
A new six-oh Ferrari, then ride up in my safari
Shit, what a deal, word up, how much it cost now?
Shit, what the deal, word up, how much it cost?
Play your position, listen, where is your pot to piss in?
'Fore we start really kissin', hot as a freaky kitchen
Hey, what the deal, word up, how much it cost now?
Hey, what the deal, word up, how much it cost now?

You got to (Scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin' it up
You got to, got to (Scream)
Pour mimosas in the cup, then you watchin' people buzz
You got to, got to (Scream)
If you from out of town, you think you're holdin' it down
You got to, got to (Scream)
You got to, you got to
(Scream)
If you up in the club, you think you tearin' it up
You got to, got to (Scream)
Pour mimosas in the cup, then you watchin' people buzz
You got to, got to (Scream)
If you from out of town, you think you're holdin' it down
You got to, got to (Scream)
You got to, you got toEmbed
