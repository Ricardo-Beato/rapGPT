Glo Gang
Holiday, sup, bro?
What we got?

AK, shotgun
We let off shots and we watch y'all run
Y'all dumb, y'all ain't gettin' no money
I'm flexin' on these suckas all the time
Spend my money, it's all mines
Runnin' through a 100 thousand 'cause I get money all the time
Say they gettin' money, they all lying
I think I'm the youngest flexer of all time

I'm off this dope, I'm all high
Just bought a new gun, let's go do a drive-by
Ain't even gotta do it, my niggas gon' do a drive-by
You better duck, lil goons finna shoot ya graa graa
I will never snitch and I will not lie
But nigga try to take my jewelry bye bye
No bitch, I don't want no pussy bye bye
And If yo' nigga think itâ€™s cookies graa graa

AK, shotgun
We let off shots and we watch y'all run
Y'all dumb, y'all ain't gettin' no money
I'm flexin' on these suckas all the time
Spend my money, it's all mines
Runnin' through a 100 thousand 'cause I get money all the time
Say they gettin' money, they all lying
I think I'm the youngest flexer of all time

She gave me top, like she know how
Tell me why you bitches do that all the time
I got some Cubans that'll do it all the time
Used to move dope, got some niggas that do it all the time
I used to rob, I got some niggas that will do it all the time
And on Sheroid, bitch I was shootin' all the time
I'm from O'Block, where they be shootin' all the time
But we ain't worried because we got all the guns
Bitch, we got

AK, shotgun
We let off shots and we watch y'all run
Y'all dumb, y'all ain't gettin' no money
I'm flexin' on these suckas all the time
Spend my money, it's all mines
Runnin' through a 100 thousand 'cause I get money all the time
Say they gettin' money, they all lying
I think I'm the youngest flexer of all time23Embed
