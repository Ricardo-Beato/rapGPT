LilJu made this beat
Real fuckin' hot girl shit, bitch
Real fuckin' ratchet shit, bitch
Come in the club and get it clapping and shit, bitch
Yeah, ah
Ayy, ayy, yeah

Bitch, you drunk as fuck, huh
Throw that ass up, ayy

Fuck his ass up, yeah, ah

Who shake that ass the best? Me
He wanna know how I move on the D
I want a nigga that eat like a Q
Why you with her and she built like a P?
Ride on that dick on my tiptoes
Pussy so good that he hittin' the woah
I'm tryna come put that ass in your face
I got him makin' a mess in his clothes
I got him fallin' in love with me
I got him all in the mall spending
I said, "If I come and give you this ass
Is you gon' know what to do with it?"
I got him fallin' in love with me
I got him all in the mall spending
I said, "If I come and give you this ass
Is you gon' know what to do with it?" Ah
