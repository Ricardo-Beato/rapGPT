10 ContributorsNext To You Lyrics
Darlin', you don't even know
I'm layin' right next to you
Sometime I feel so alone
That I don't know what to do
I don't know why, I don't know why
I said I don't know why, I don't know why

I was out with my crew tonight
We were all gettin' super nice
I had so much to drink that you'd think
I'm 'bout to go and paint the bathroom sink pink
Rule number 1: always puke alone
The second rule is always puke at home
I guess it's time to go
Didn't see nobody from my family around
So I went outside to flag a taxi down
I told a cab to take 35 south and let the windows down
I gotta air myself out
I put a new piece of gum in my mouth
As the car pulled up right in front of the house
And all that I can think about is how much I love fucking you
I can't wait to get inside
But I never considered that you'd be fast asleep
And now I'm masturbating with some Vaseline, and
You might also like
Darlin', you don't even know
I'm layin' right next to you
Sometime I feel so alone
That I don't know what to do
I don't know why, I don't know why
I said I don't know why, I don't know why

I'd love to press my face into the flesh
In between your pregnant breasts
I'd love to squeeze your butt and make you horny
But I know you gotta wake up in the morning
So I'mma just lay next to you
And think about when I make sex to you
It probably sound kinda perverted, I imagine
But that ain't enough to make me wanna curb my enthusiasm
It feels so right in my left
And I don't think she protest if I don't leave a mess
I disappear into the smell of your hair
And it's becoming apparent that I've become incoherent
With my mind on my business, fist full of carnal
Blurry with the vision, I'm spinnin' like a marble
Fade to black way under the shellac
Can't fap, too wasted, if you was awake you'd laugh
And...
Darlin', you don't even know
I'm lyin' right next to you
Sometime I feel so alone
That I don't know what to do
I don't know why, I don't know why
I said I don't know why, I don't know why
Darlin', you don't even know
I'm layin' right next to you
Sometime I feel so alone
That I don't know what to do, eh
But I don't know why, I don't know why
No, I don't know why, I don't know whyEmbed
