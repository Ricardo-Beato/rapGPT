Supercomputer status, walkin' along streets
Everyone is an addict, stumbling concrete
What was the motivation? Constant communication
Everybody wanna get chose like Moses
Came out Mother Earth smelling like roses
Summon the new edition, made it way too efficient
Made us the guinea pig and did it with no permission
Told it to call a friend, didn't tell it to listen
So very scary, so binary, zero or one
Like or dislike, coal mine canary
I dream in color, not black and white
You sell your daughter on that data stream
Dopamine make it hit now
Humans don't understand, humans gon' sell a lie
Humans gotta survive, we know we gon' die
Nothing can live forever, you know we gon' try
Life, is it really worth it? The algorhythm is perfect, mmh

Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm
You might also like
Step, step, slide, slide
Move your body from side to side
Clap your hands, don't spite the vibe
Keep on moving, you might survive
Pressure is to evolve, take a bite of the apple
We crush it into the sauce, how do we know the cost?
How do we know the truth without feeling what could be false?
Freedom of being wrong, freedom of being lost
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Feelin' like the devil did it (Devil did it, ooh)
Lord willing, I'ma step to it (Step to it)
You gon' fall behind if you can't do it (Ooh, yeah)
Ooh, we eating good over here now (Yeah)
Is you eating good over there now? (No)
Human ain't the move, do I care now? (No)
Looking for something worth it, the algorhythm is perfect, mmh

Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm (Woo)
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
Algorhythm (Woo)
Algorhythm (Yeah, yeah)11Embed
