13 ContributorsFast N Furious Lyrics
Paul Walker, bitch, Fast N Furious
Ridin' real fast and I'm serious
Is ya getting money, boy? I'm curious
All this money making me delirious
Paul Walker, bitch, Fast N Furious
In a jet, bitch I am Leer-ious
Shining bright, bitch, my diamonds are the silliest
My bitches are the prettiest
My cars are the hideous

Them bitches look like monsters, ayy
Bitch, them bitches look like Tonkas, ayy, ayy
I'm riding in a Tonka, ayy
Looking like I'm Yahweh
Yao Ming, bitch, I'm with the Houston Rockets, ayy
And I got the rocket in my pocket, best believe I will pop it, ayy
Best believe you'll get dropped and be rolling
Can't tell witcha breath, nigga, hold it
Hear the ambulance come
I hope they can save ya, son, ayy, ayy
I hope they can save ya, homeboy
Shouldn't have been playin', homeboy
What the fuck was ya sayin', homeboy?
Gratahtah, duh-duh-duh, we ain't playing homeboy

Ridin' real fast and I'm serious
Is ya getting money, boy? I'm curious
All this money making me delirious
Paul Walker, bitch, Fast N Furious
In a jet, bitch I am Leer-ious
Shining bright, bitch, my diamonds are the silliest
My bitches are the prettiest
My cars are the hideous2Embed
