14 ContributorsPaper Cha$inâ€™ Lyrics
Dollar bill, yeah
Music from the soul, y'all
Yeah

I told my niggas we gotta chase the bills (Bills)
Thousands, a couple mils (Couple mils)
Vanilla skies, nice crib (Nice crib)
Dependin' on the weather how I choose my 'mobile ('Mobile)
Cruise through the strip just to cop a zip
Bad chick (Yeah)
Tatted underneath her lip (Yeah)
Get a lift, guarantee I'm gonna hit (I'm gonna hit)
She love the shit I wear, sponsored by the time of year (Yeah)
Always prepared (Yeah)
Dutch master (Yeah)
In her ear (Yeah)
Get plastered
My crew members get hazard (Uh)
Skateboardin' fashion (Yeah)
NASCAR drivin' (Uh)

Dolla bill, dope, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
