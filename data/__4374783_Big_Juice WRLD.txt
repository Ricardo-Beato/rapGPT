Hmm, uh-huh
(Hit-Boy)
Bitch
Man, this life shit gettin' crazy, crazy
I done, I done made it
I done made it, made it, yeah
I'm sick and tired of these hatin' ass niggas, though
Let my dick breathe for a couple seconds, man, shit
Fuck nigga
Uh, yeah

I'm on a Percocet, yeah, I just had to relapse
Even at my worst, I'm feeling like I am the best
I done Metta World Peace to myself like I'm Ron Artest
I never been a referee, but I still got a Tec, Kel-Tec
Shoot you in your stomach, make this shit hard to digest
Rockstar, listening to Jimi Hendrix in the projects, yeah (Uh)
I'ma turn a nigga block to an art project
Picasso, I paint that, where the fuck is the bank at?
Army sergeant, no rank, yeah, okay

If you ain't payin' a hundred thousand, get them features out my face
50K to install a codeine fountain in my new estate
I got that pump, it's ironic how that pump made him pump his brakes
I ain't Lil Pump, but I got double Glocks on me like Gucci Gang
We ball like Wilt Chamberlain, like the name of them old Gucci tapes
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Gucci Mane
Hit a lil' bitch like, "Burr" (Huh), why she so insecure? (Uh)
Who got the pills in here? (Huh) How do you live in here? (Uh)
I got my crib here, havin' some kids here
I do it big, yeah, big, big, yeah
I do it big, yeah, big, big, yeah (Let's go)
She saw me in the club, like how did you get in here? (Uh-uh)
Fuck is you doin' here? Why is you shootin' here? (Let's go)
Doin' it big, yeah (Uh-huh), big, big, yeah (Ayy, ayy)
Doin' it big, yeah (Uh-huh), big, big, yeah (Oh-ayy)
Yeah, away, away, away, away, away
You want bullshit, they'll hit you with that olé
Chip on my shoulder, I gotta prove myself, no Lays
Even when I stand up and hit it from the back, I'ma still get laid
That bitch a dragon, she run up on me, she get slayed
I took a piss in your dead homie grave, uh (Let's get it)
Chicago shit, Chicago nigga
Fuckin' on a Philadelphia bitch, uh
Yeah, I'm super rich, I could pay your rent, Rollie doesn't tick
Chopper with the tints, pull up with the tints, clip is extended
Never gave a fuck, never gave a shit, only gettin' rich
Live how I live, forgive and forget, man, I don't forget shit
You don't know when to stand
You got it bad, man, come in, oh
Oh, baby, come in
Man, I don't forget shit
Uh, yeah
