Macaroni time
She say she like my car, Forgis ride
Seen me with tha stars, now she wanna know me now
Unh-unh 'cause I told her now I'm actin' phony now
Buck buck for nigga think it's macaroni time

She say she like my car and she like how my Forgis ride
She seen me with them stars now she wanna know me now
Unh-unh 'cause I'm Tony now I'm actin' phony now
Buck buck for a nigga think it's macaroni time
Couple bucks for these bitches, let me slap them on they ass
Tough luck for these niggas think they next I'm on they ass
So what I walk in court smelling like packs? I got them bands
Glo' boys that's what almighty Sosa got them sayin'

She wanna be a Glory Girl, but she don't like my Glory Guys
I know this bitch a thot, she wanna meet my momma now
But unh-unh I gotta QP of earth rolling, let's get high
Light it up, I guarantee that she will touch the sky
He say he gettin' money but I know that's a lie
I see ones and fives in your bankroll right now
But unh-unh you ain't flexin' boy you need some exercise
You cuttin' up you need some GBE lessons now
I hear these niggas flexin' sayin' they know the Glory Gang
How you know us if we don't know your name?
Unh-unh just bought a pint I'm leanin right now
Dumb fuck just popped a flat, I'm beamin' right now
Unh-unh I feel like catchin' a homie right now
No love, I see a opp I'm droppin' him right now
She let me fuck then I'm droppin her' right now
I'ma hop up in my 'Rari top, I'm dropping it right now
You might also like
She say she like my car and she like how my Forgis ride
She seen me with them stars now she wanna know me now
Unh-unh 'cause I'm Tony now I'm actin' phony now
Buck buck for a nigga think it's macaroni time
Couple bucks for these bitches, let me slap them on they ass
Tough luck for these niggas think they next I'm on they ass
So what I walk in court smelling like packs? I got them bands
Glo' boys that's what almighty Sosa got them sayin'73Embed
