159 ContributorsAmerica Lyrics
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

Fight the power, fight the power
Fight for the right to get up and say fuck white power
Everybody come and get up, get on
And no matter what you fighting for I promise that it’ll live on
Like make America great again
Make it hate again
Make it white
Make everybody fight
Fuck that
Street’s disciple
My raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like Cobain
And everybody wonder why the world insane
Why the world insane
Why the world insane
Why the world insane
You might also like
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

The world going mad over one drug
I'm filling up a bag at the gun club
In the shadow of a nation that it once was
All this false information I'ma unplug, young blood
It is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov
The man in the high castle in a hot tub
We locked in a pine casket, it's botched up
Like plastic surgery, classic perjury
The way they can plead the fifth to the 13th
And stop to search me, controversy
Them boys in the klansmen hoods is thirsty but hey motherfucker

Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

Young blood, it takes another look and feel
Slap that fear monger at that wheel
Olive branches in the arrow seal
Alternative facts mean to lie and steal
Gotta to go to ban the whole
Refugee population from the land they stole
In the name of the government
Rich white man while the rest be suffering
Run from the locked down borders
Ain’t like Flint ain’t got clean water
Dirty politics never come clean
Can ya'll believe this shit in 2017?
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my dick

George bush don't care about black people
2017 and Donald trump is the sequel so
Shit, I'll say what Kanye won't
Wake the fuck up and give the people what they want
Man it's all love but the youth is confused
Your music is 20/20 but them political views
Is blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred
'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word
But I gotta say what need be said
'Cause I ain't fuckin with that hat, with the colors that’s white and red
I know some people wish I’d act white instead
Say I’d use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead
Fuck that, everything I do, I do it right
To teach the people that they have the power to fight
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don’t get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon' need patience
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop
I'm just as angry another person got shot
Don’t be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and
I’ma tell you what I need right now
I’ma tell you what we all need
I need my people of color...
Don’t run from Trump, run against him
Hey mothafucka I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

Ohh, hands up for the 5-0
Oh, ohh, hands up for the 5-0

I been in the cut, liquor in my cup, 38 tuck
I don’t give a fuck, I don’t give a damn
I just wanna live, I just wanna eat
But I gotta do it for the hood, do it, do it for the street, uh
Dope in the trunk
Creepin out the cut
9 by the gut
Never get enough
I don’t give a fuck
Stupid mothafuckas move backwards
Mastered the hustle
Something in the duffle for you bastards
Grind over chatter
Cheese on my mind like a packer
Only thing that matter, bitch scatter
You in my way, about to spray, the A-K
Middle of the day, like that shit’s okay
Never had a job, never had a education
Only know probation
Never had a job never had a education
Yeah, I never had chance in this world, I never had one
No, I never had a chance in this world, I was labeled a bad one

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now send the blacks back to Africa
Build a wall for the Mexicans
Send the whites back to Europe
Give the land to the Native American
Take the skyscraper
Tear down the casino
Print your own paper
And bear down on the gringo
Take the skyscraper
Take the skyscraper
Tear down the casino
Tear down the casino
Print your own paper
Print your own paper
And bear down on the gringo
And bear down on the, down on the, down on the
Take the skyscraper
The skyscraper
Tear down the casino
Tear down the casino
Print your own paper
Print your own paper
And bear down on the gringo
Bear down on the, down on the...

Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
