Yeahhhhh
I let my hater be my motivator
I got fifty pounds of purp in my refrigerator
Uhh, so damn an investigator
When I re-up, they bring it in a tractor-trailer
Uh, I'm the king of Decatur man
Got that fruity 'dro, any kinda flavor man
(Any kinda flavor?) Bubble kush or the purple thrax
White Lionel, you ain't never heard of that
Uhh, I got them sevens for the buck fifty
One-twenty-five if a nigga fuck wit me
Uhh, you doin bad buyin' fifty slabs
I'm in Texaco buyin' out sandwich bags
Uhh, niggas chirpin' on my NexTel
Gucci what it look like, nigga fish scale
Uhh, I use to hold down the hotel
Now I'm a member of the Big Cat cartel

Show you how to hustle, show you how to hustle
Make a grind all night, I'mma show you how to hustle
Show you how to hustle, show you how to hustle

Show you how to hustle, show you how to hustle
It's an all night flight, I'mma show you how to hustle
Show you hustle, show you how to hustle

I used to be the nigga with the dimes
Now I'm on the grind with the 4's and the 9's
Uhh, they say it's Gucci time to shine
A young black entrepeneur in his prime
Uhh, a nigga gota get the whole thang
Nineteen five everytime my phone rang
Uhh, I got so much clientele
Black tee, black gat and a pocket scale
Uhh, so I cain't go broke man
People know me as the dope man's dope man
Uhh, I made this one for my folks man
For the J's who be smokin outta Coke cans
Uhh, and they askin fo' a wake up
You want a brick I gotcha covered like make-up

You drop a couple of dollars I'll get'cha coke, I'll get'cha boy

Yeahhhhh
I'm trapper, not a rapper
Whole thang no shame time to bust it out the rapper
Uhh, uhh, so I ain't gotta go plat'
I'mma make a half a mill' when my package get back
Uh, uh, Gucci Mane on the track
I'm the next best thing since cooked up crack
Uh, uh, I get my car washed free
Cause the fiends in the hood man they really love me
Uhh, uhh, trash bag full of tree
Little boys say they wanna be just like me
Uhh, uhh, I blew so much purp'
Make a nigga in the hood think he scared of work
Uhh, uh, since I linked up with Big Cat
He told me I cain't sale unless I sell a 10-pack
Uhh, but hold it back, check I spit that
A hundred bricks, fifty bales and my 10-strap
If you cain't get white I'mma show you how to hustle
Show you how to hustle, show you how to hustle
Make a grind all night, I'mma show you how to hustle
Show you how to hustle, show you how to hustle
Put ya game down tight, I'mma show you how to hustle
Show you how to hustle, show you how to hustle
It's an all night flight, I'mma show you how to hustle
Show you hustle, show you how to hustle
