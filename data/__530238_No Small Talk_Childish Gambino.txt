58 ContributorsNo Small Talk Lyrics
As time goes on (Hello?, hello?)
Your talk keeps getting smaller (Hello?, hello?)
As Childish lives in his short shorts,
He's got no time for your short money!

Two gold chains and I still don't never wear 'em
Why would I wear 'em? Cheese like a camera
Spendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford
I'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like 'Damn, I'm so handsome'
If it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer?
Ghost on my wrist (wrist), got me so Casper
Flow so cold, watch them haters get asthma
And every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one

Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
You might also like
Three cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em
Why would I call 'em?  Bitch you know I'm ballin'
Spendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding (Swish)
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans
And he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'
All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy
Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy
I got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi

Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

Young Bino, we be mobbin'
You don't see me, I'm on an island
These haters left us no choice
Leave the trap like so moist
Little rock like dope boys
Oh my God, I'm out of fucks
Colombian but she ain't a plug
That's racist
In '96 I had K-swiss
You 96 with some fake bitch
And I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language
Head game so Cambridge
God damn, you dirty...
You were lettin' me bust in it
But if they ask I plead the fifth
Ok this the part where I need ya'll to make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans

Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk20Embed
