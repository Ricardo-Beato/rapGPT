19 ContributorsAinâ€™t Hard Enough Lyrics
What up, Duke?
Aye, y'all niggas ain't hard enough
Y'all knuckles ain't scarred enough
Y'all ain't in foreign cars enough
Yeah

Y'all niggas ain't hard enough
Y'all knuckles ain't scarred enough
Y'all gang ain't large enough
And I came far as fuck
5 Cubans in a Harley truck
Buck 60 down Arlington
Please don't start with us
Sound of gunshots charge me up
Come through once a week like the garbage truck
This some thousand dollar chains with the carbon clutch
Quarter million dollar car with the driver cause
Everything I do done bossed up
Disrespectful and arrogant but who gon' stop us?
Rich nigga off the block, don't block us
Rap dreams disappeared and that 6-0 pop up
See most niggas in this life get locked up
Lost inside the system pull a white man's stock up
Only difference is, I picked hip-hop up
And this why they still can't stop us
You might also like
Y'all niggas ain't hard enough
Y'all niggas ain't hard enough

Ahh, niggas ain't as hard as us
My young'n actin', finna charge him up
Gotta drop somethin' to be a part of us
The 40. tore the target up
We was kids tearing party's up
Yeah, the suckers know how far we up
The smokers know how far we've come
These niggas ain't known for parking nothin'
They ain't follow niggas, cars or nothin'
30 or they chargin' for me
And you ain't pluck me, where your shooters at?
Running marathons around your goofy ass
Pull up to the necklace, I be reckless, real shooter gang
'Fore I 'buy the nookie K ya gotta let me shoot the K
Told my mama "nothing" when she ask me what I do today
Modified G-lock converted to a fully thang
Had to give twin 10 bands the way he do his thing
Shoestring around a stupid thang
Had to give twin 10 bands the way he do his thing
Shoestring around a stupid thang
Y'all niggas ain't hard enough

Young Neighborhood Nip
What's up nephew?
It's your uncle Keita Roc
Aye, I heard you dropping that  last summer
Aye, keep your foot on their neck, my nigga
Gas, full press
You know what it do, niggaEmbed
