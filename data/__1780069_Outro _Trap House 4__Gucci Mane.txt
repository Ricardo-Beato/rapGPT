16 ContributorsOutro  Lyrics
Mama work for Quaker Oaks, get ya out of 'em cracker folks
I told my mama "go n' retire" cuz her son worth a lotta dough
My brother went onto the service, what the fuck you do it for?
We tote AKs like they was legal, nigga we from Gresham Road
Cross the street from Randy Logan, now we call him Joe Blow
I count 50 up every ounce, now I count 50 every show
50 thou to show you how every chain I bling it out
It get real hot around six o'clock, so you better not get caught in the stove
When the red dogs and the black cats, pull up its a crack back
I got Air Max and I'ma run like Carl Luis, 'cause I can't go through it
I had an 84 Buick, I was 17
I bought my first car, cash at 15
I'm lyin' right now, god strike me, for a nigga ever hit made 9Gs
Can't reminisce, I got enemies  feelin' I got your memories
Can't press me, can't pimp me, I send a fuck nigga to Emory
Nine-four degree emergency room where you gon' be full with IVs
I got a red Bens, got a red Charger, got a red Rari, and got a red JeepYou might also like3Embed
