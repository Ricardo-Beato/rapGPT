14 ContributorsI Get Scared Lyrics
I... I get scared... when it comes (When it comes)
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared... when it comes (When it comes)
And I know I'm gonna be alright

I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

Y'all don't know things I know
Where I've been and where I go
Y'all don't know 'cause y'all can't see
Look, you do you let me be me
Y'all don't know the pain I felt
Or, how I played the cards I was dealt
Y'all don't know what you're talkin' about
Y'all need to stop runnin' your mouth

I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
You might also like
I get down for real, all I know is one way
Sunday to Sunday, only game is gunplay
And I know that one day, I'm gon' get it
Until I get it, I'm gon' get it
We gets it in like a fat bitch cookin'
Like a nosy bitch that's lookin'
Been had the gauge huntin', since the age 11
Niggas think you on stage, you frontin' - look here
I'm that nigga, if I knock on your door
You gon' look in my eyes and be like, "Dog, what's wrong?"
You feel it like I feel it, there's somethin' in the air
Wait, c'mere, yeah it's comin' from right there

I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

I, I get scared when it comes
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared when you're gone
And I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be alright (I'm gonna be alright)
I, I get scared, I get scared, when it comes
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

I know they love me real, so why pretend
Make a nigga take it back to where it all began
I mean, even we went, yeah it's that bad
Don't let me catch you slippin', yeah I'm that mad
What'll the Dog do when there's no cats to chase?
I'm sure there's somethin' else and try to take off his face
Yeah you was in the wrong place, at the wrong time
I'm takin' everything you got, I want it, all mine
How a nigga gon' stop me when, I don't stop for signs
Yeah you got mine, but don't start lyin'
Understand a nigga tryin', but don't stop it from happenin'
But I guess they won't GET IT, until I start clappin'4Embed
