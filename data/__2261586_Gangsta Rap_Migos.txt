We're not against rap
We're not against rappers
But we are against those Migos

Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back

Quavo
Fuck the media, fuck
They hatin' on a young gangsta
We put the bando in the Wikipedia
Still these niggas ain't thankful

Migo Gang, we the most dangerous
Narcotics made a nigga famous
If you bangin' twist your fingers
Throw a party for the gangstas

We the biggest gangstas at the top of the list
Gave my brothers no bond and said they a flight risk
They recordin', reportin', Fox 5 on my dick
I just gave them information 'bout my new bitch
You might also like
They asking me questions
No information no participatin', ain't no conversation
They hatin' I made it, speculatin'
Takin' 'bout how many drugs in that vacant

Gangsta rap comin' back like a nigga got 80's crack with an 8-track
Come in your house, where the safe at?
Homey don't play that

Young niggas we bringin' back gangsta rap
I put that dope right up where your bitch anal at
My brothers keep a girlfriend in my cul-de-sac
When the white people see me have a heart attack, cause of that...
Takeoff

Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back
Gangsta rap is back2Embed
