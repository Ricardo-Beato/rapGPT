Ayy

I need a freak
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
I'm in the street, why?
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
Ah

Rollie pollie ollie, nigga
No gold card, I use a trojan, nigga
Drinking red, raviolis, nigga
Fucked her in store 'til they was closing, nigga
Head and pussy feed my motion, nigga
I found her phone and I didn't scroll through, nigga
Green slime ball, bases loaded nigga
I think they jumped on my pockets 'cause they swollen, nigga
Drophead, it's a drophead
Haiti boy, I leave them shot dead
You ain't no gangsta nigga, stop that
I fucked that bitch before she gave me head
Telling me you're gon' win
That's some shit I don't know about
Fucked her in the deep end
That's some shit you gon' know about
Big B, Willy B, still smoking gas, eyes low as a Chinese
Still wearing flags, bitch I bleed 'til I'm deceased
I ain't talking guns, but I smoke the head of Khalif'
Call Thot-Keesha, she got the head of the week
This so bien, mamacita no Weezy
Nigga tatted her with nut and she ain't sleeveless
She want every drop that come out a penis
You might also like
I need a freak
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
I'm in the street, why?
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
Ah

First to pull up, I'm a gangsta I know
He know, she know, we know, take that, Debo
Leave a fuck boy leaking bout a kilo
I will, pull up, S-L-I-M-E, my steelo
He see me kickin' shit now he wanna sell me that moto
Plus he know I got stripes like Ocho Cinco
Yeah he know a nigga Lion-hearted, no Bengal
The world could think I'm dreaming but I swear to God he know
What your momma tell you about playing with that fire?
Didn't God tell you if you livin' you gon' die?
When you shot 'em up you know that pressure was applied
My nephew saw his daddy get sent out home to the sky
If you knew any better, he would've said "don't break rules"
If I didn't know better, I would've stayed in a school
If that bitch didn't know better, I would've played it in two
If I didn't know better, I would've crossed out God and went voodoo
I need a freak
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
I'm in the street, why?
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
Ah
I need a freak
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
I'm in the street, why?
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
