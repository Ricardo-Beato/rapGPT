Woah, yeah
First order of business, dawg, I gotta thank my mama
Second order of business, share the blessings, no more trauma
Third order of business, do good deeds and get good karma
First order of business, get this money to my shorty
Loyalty and gratitude, the only thing you swear me
Will you be the person that's gon' love me in my forties?

First order of business, dawg, I gotta shake the toxic
All this back and forth, it's weighing heavy on my conscience
When I met your sister, she said, "This nigga's obnoxious"
Fuck the ones comin' for me
Can't focus on thе petty, they'll come back and dеstroy me
Why she speakin' anyway? She fuckin' her employees
I ain't even asked, but the room was way too noisy

Yeah
First order of business, dawg, I gotta thank my mama
Second order of business, share the blessings, no more trauma
Third order of business, do good deeds and get good karma
First order of business, get this money to my shorty
Loyalty and gratitude, the only thing you swear me
Will you be the person that's gon' love me in my forties?

Wake up in the morning, brush my teeth before I see my queen (Tick, tick, tick, ka-boom)
Wow, who are you? (Ka-boom) Bitch, I'm two-phone Baby Keem
I think you're selfish, I like soul food
Pussy taste like soul food, that's why you've been my go-to
And that's my whole thing (That's my thing), I do whole things (That's my thing)
She go both ways (That's my thing), you had a ho phase
Pussy good, so I come through on my worst days
Like I should, tell me if I'm understood

Yeah
First order of business, dawg, I gotta thank my mama
Second order of business, share the blessings, no more trauma
Third order of business, do good deeds and get good karma
First order of business, get this money to my shorty
Loyalty and gratitude, the only thing you swear me
Will you be the person that's gon' love me in my forties?10Embed
