6 ContributorsLove for God Lyrics
I got so much
To love God for
Say it again
I got so much
To love God for

I love you for the cloudy days, yeah
For the stars you send my way

I got so much
To love God for
I got so much
I got so much
Oh lord, I believe
I got so much
I believe I got so much
To love, to love, to love God
I got so much
Yes I do, to love
To love God for
I got so much
Ooh
To love God for
I got so
I got so much
So much to love God for
You might also like
I love your fall
My cloudy days
For the time I couldn't even fall down on my knees and pray

I got so much
I got so much
To love God for
I got so much
To love
To love God for
And I wake up early in the morning, yeah
I got so much
Ooh
To love God for
Somebody know what I'm singing about to see
I got so much
I got so much
To love God for
When I'm looking in a mirror, yeah
I got so much
I just gotta say, thank you Jesus
To love God for
I got so much
So much love
To love God forEmbed
