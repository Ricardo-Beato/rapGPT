Yo
Pussy will bring you in this motherfucker
Damn sure take you out too, kid
Check this shit out

A rainy day laid up thinkin', sittin', gettin' bent
Watchin' old '70s flicks
Mind's on the slouch back in the couch, heard the phone ring
It was a shorty from Uptown I met back day
Long time no hear from, no doubt, long time no see
I heard you had a seed, a baby girl and now she's three
What's up with that cat, you know who, your baby pops
Slung rocks up top, then heard he got knocked
"He home, fuck that nigga, I'm on my own
Matter fact, got my own crib, plus I'm all alone"
Word? The bitch is bad, chill, son, she got me tempted
Reminiscing the fatty, jumped in the ride I rented
Fresh Timbs, Mecca dice well presented
Sippin E&J straight, was bent when I entered
Gave her a hug, stared her straight into her mug
See, ain't seen the bitch since back then and that was bug
Turned the VCR on, Friday, my favorite flick
Offered me a drink, Aliz√©, I take a sip (No doubt)
Got into convo, "How you been over the years?"
"Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear"
"What you mean? I thought you left that cat," which was true
"I'm not talkin' about him, another dude
Been with him for a year and had a baby by him
Matter fact, you saw him downstairs, you walked by him"
Now I'm thinking setup, could it be? Or maybe not
She said, "Don't sweat it, he don't got the top lock"
Tried to play it cool, but in my head, shorty's wildin'
Usin' me to get the next nigga jealous, called up the fellas
Ty Nitty line was busy, so I beeped Gotti
Gotti was with Trip and two other grimeys
The Twins, "Let me begin, then explain
I'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed
Stuck without a gat, not prepared for combat"
Gave the address, told my son there's more cats
Be there in a second, big gats, no half steppin'
They flippin' on me, talkin' 'bout I never learn my lesson
I laugh in additional, hit them with the math
Hung up the jack while shorty soaked in the bath
Played the living room, dozed off for a second
When I woke up, shorty was standing ass-naked
Make moves, all this bullshit, pussy better be good
Stepped to the room, threw off my Champion hood
Slow motion, all along, bent off the potion
Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open
It was over, laid up in the cut, I heard a thump
Jumped up, threw on my boxers, yo, what the fuck?
All the sudden, I saw this Black motherfucker
With this big-ass gat and two other motherfuckers (What the fuck?)
Black masks, clutching duct tape, no escape
Tied me up, smacked me all in my face
Shorty wasn't even screamin', looked up, saw 'em schemin'
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this"
All bloodied up, shook the fuck up, held for ransom
They yelled, "Got the bones," smiled, then started dancin' (Yeah)
The phone rung, it was my sons, they let 'em know they had me hostage
Threw me on the phone, said, "Son, don't worry, yo, we got this"
Regardless what the outcome all this bullshit
Take a nigga word, don't ever go see a bitch, wordYou might also like5Embed
