3 ContributorsCradle to the Grave (Freestyle) Lyrics{Mobb Deep!} Show these bitch-ass niggas
{Free Agents!} Over and over and over again how we do this shit
{*cock and gunshot courtesy DJ Whoo Kid*}

Aiyyo, they say I'm cold-hearted, well I was born like that
From the womb to my tomb I'll be on it like that
From my cradle to my grave I'll be on that same shit
No bitch can change my ways, I show no care
No thug can shake my frame, I show no fear
Be a cold day in hell once I arrive there
I slap God in the face for puttin me through this torture
{*GOD*} And bust through heaven's gates
{*DAMN*} if they don't wanna let me up
So while I'm still alive and kickin
I'ma run through this planet like I own this shit here
Fuck up out my way 'fore you get yourself fitted
And sized up like tailored for bullets that fit in
The meat on your bones like knives on Thanksgiving
You bird-ass nigga, I'm a mobster, you a pigeon
Make no mistake, there's a difference between us
So when you see my face, turn your head like a slut
Word up, we body niggas for reckless eyeballin
Niggas signin record deals and think they ballin
My niggas make joint ventures and own they mansions
You prostitute-ass nigga, hoe faggot, you a RAPPER
{*DAMN!*}
