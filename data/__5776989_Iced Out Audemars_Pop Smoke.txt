Rico's going crazy again
Woo
Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
I got forty thousand
I'm up in all the stores, wait
Look
Oh, you feelin' sturdy, nigga?
Look, we 'bout to get sturdy now (Baow)
We 'bout to get sturdy now (Look, shake it)

Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
Got like forty more (Forty more)
Walked in with forty thousand (Forty thousand)
I'm up in all the stores (All the stores)
Bad bitch from Baltimore (Baltimore)
And she love Dior (Dior)
She throw a hunnid clip (Clip)
When it rains, it pours (Rains it pours)

Shawty light and sexy (Sexy)
She like givin' becky
Sexy like she drivin' Lexus (Woo)
Bad bitch gon' smack the reverend (Reverend)
Spin your block like Tetris (Tetris)
Longhorn, Texas
I can't fuck no fat bitch, never (Nah)
I'm young and reckless
I said I'm shootin' proper
I make 'em Cha Cha
I'm a rocker, I'll boom your casa
Then do the Cucaracha
I order steak with lobster
After I smoke my purple
Southside, Nobu, know I'm global
I'm on a different timin'
My VS diamonds dancin'
This ain't no SI stones
I'm smokin' Runtz in Rome
Ice on my neck, I'm freezin'
If you don't suck dick, I'm leavin'
Bad bitch geekin', showin' cleavage
She know she teasin'
Don't try this at home
This for the rich and famous, uh
Highly educated, patient
Off the Runtz, I'm faded
All my cars updated
Only V-12 engines
All my checks is clearin'
Yours is pending
Only drivin' German
In the Benz, I'm swervin'
You might also like
Iced out Audemars
Got like forty more
Walked in with forty thousand
I'm up in all the stores
Bad bitch from Baltimore
And she love Dior
She throw a hunnid clip (Grrt)
When it rains, it pours

Wait, uh
I'm in Hertz spending thousands (Thousands)
Lil' baddies from the island (Woo)
They told me, "Dafi, you be wildin'"
Twenty thousand on Dior
And the brand new Porsche got no mileage
These foreign bitches actin' childish
I be flossing, drippin' with no stylist (Hold on)
Uh (Uh)
Ask Rico Beats, yeah, I'm a G.O.A.T.
I pour the liquor, it's a boat
Bitch, I'm Dafi Woo, I'm not Folk (GDK)
Uh, wait
And I spent a hundred on an AP (What?)
I make you niggas look like babies
And I throw the rock up like I'm Jay-Z ('Layo)
Iced out Audemars, spent like 50K
We up in all the stores (Stores)
Uh, uh
Oh, you feeling sturdy, nigga? (Come on)
'Cause you could get shot down (Boom, boom, boom)
And I spin like fifty, nigga
'Cause I keep them Glocks 'round (Baow)
Popping Percs in Bally
Keep her percolated
Shades dark for all the haters
Nigga, I'm a taker
I make you meet your maker (Rrr)
Iced out Audemars (Hold on)
Dafi Woo
Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
Got like forty more (Forty more)
Walked in with forty thousand (Forty thousand)
I'm up in all the stores (All the stores)
Bad bitch from Baltimore (Baltimore)
And she love Dior (Dior)
She throw a hunnid clip (Clip)
When it rains, it pours (Rains it pours)6Embed
