60 ContributorsRed Eye Lyrics
Hey!

Love, hate, play this game of give and take
Go, stay, we all make mistakes
I'll say, what a wonderful escape
I embrace
Hey, hey, hey

Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
And I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night a red eye, red eye)
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
And I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night a red eye, red eye)

I can't understand, I don't understand it
The visions in my head
I just can't make sense of it
I can't understand, I don't understand it
The visions in my head
I just can't make sense of it
Cause I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
There's no use for it, baby
I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
I’m so used to you, baby
I can never run, I can never run
There’s no use for it, baby
I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
I’m so used to you, baby

Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
And I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye) (Oh)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night a red eye, red eye) (Oh)
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
And I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye) (Oh)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night a red eye, red eye) (Oh)
Ooo-oh! Ooo-oh!
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
Baby, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooo-oh! Ooo-oh-oh!
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
Baby, oh-oh-oh! (Hey!)

Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
And I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye) (Oh, ooo-oh!)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night a red eye, red eye) (Oh, ooo-oh!)
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
And I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night on a red eye, red eye) (Oh, ooo-oh!)
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
(Through the night a red eye, red eye) (Oh, ooo-oh!)27Embed
