NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (When it's on that's who you get, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (That's your motherfucking clique, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (You a motherfucking snitch, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD

Niggas wanna shine like me (Me), rhyme like me (Me)
They don't walk around with a .9 like me (Me)
They don't want to do it three-to-nine like me
And ain't strong enough to take nine like me
Ayo, you think about shittin' on 50, save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David's
I teach niggas sign language that ain't deaf, son
(*Click-clack*) You heard that? That mean run
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa
Pull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at your car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face
It's nothing, I can go after Ma$e fan base
A shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doc to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth, I (Huck-too) spit it out
I don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city
Hoes be like "50, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P. Diddy
You got fat while we starved, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn, won't learn
You might also like
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

Mama said everything that happened to us was part of God's plan
So at night, when I talk to him, I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy 'cause I don't fear man
'Cause I fear when I kill a man God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?
I been could've killed these niggas, I'm still waitin'
In the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors
Thirty-two karats in the cross, no flaws (Woo)
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock, Tony carry my M-1
Hold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me (Uh-huh)
Ds waiting for my response to lock me (Yeah)
This is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me, I'm the one
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

See, I done been to the pearly gates, they sent me back
Good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stay in some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me? You wanna know me?
From three-point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my co-D
See a bitch gettin' in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it's special, y'all
A country boy tell ya I'm finna blow
I'm more like a pimp than a trick, you know
You see, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worryin' about mines
Grown-ass men wearing starter kit shines
You know them little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phone
When the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won't you stop it?
Shorty, I've been watching you watching me
Now you tell me what you like more, my watch or me? Haha
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

Uh-uh, uh-uh, not like me
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Uh-uh)
We ain't got nothin' in common (Uh-uh, uh-uh, you not like me)
Hahahaha
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, you not like me23Embed
