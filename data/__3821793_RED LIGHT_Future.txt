29 ContributorsRED LIGHT Lyrics
Yeah, nigga, this shit real out here
Runnin' through the red light, lookin' through your rearview
Nigga might just sneak up on the car and try to spray you
Playin' for keeps out here in the A
It's been a long time comin'

Aw, they ain't think I'm gettin' my bag, ayy
Ran it up and gave 'em a sad face
Now anywhere around the globe
You rep the gang and you got rank, yeah
Gotta converse with the manager
When I walk inside the bank, yeah
Who would ever think they was sleepin' on me?
Goyard with a half a million on me
R&D's, it's like I'm possessed
All these diamonds on my chest

Sleepin' on the floor had made my heart colder
They try to make it hard for me, I never falter
Gotta say I'm good, I'm on the ESPY's
I made millions by the day, check my chest piece
Try to take care of my family the best I know how
Bought myself a mansion, now I gotta buy everybody a house
Takin' care of my bitches like the mother of my child
God know all my brothers sin, I gotta blow this trial
You don't get no guidance out the trenches to make it out
God knows I'll never give up on you, never will
Shit gettin' hectic with the niggas that ya kill for
Money got me hesitant, what I got to live for?
All this fame gettin' terrible
All these rings and Berettas
Flawless victory, change the weather
Hurricane, natural disaster
Pour the lean for the bastards
Take the jet across the atlas
God I pray I forget my dada
'Cause I didn't grow up to be average
All the times he lied to me, ya gave up on my arteries
I was such a worried child, just wanted you to be a part of me
Fishscale projects made a man out me
Sleepin' on the carpet made a man out me
Full of medication, I wouldn't change it
I was once broke but no complainin'
I finally start to embrace that I'm famous
It's hard for me to erase when I was nameless
You might also like
Aw, they ain't think I'm gettin' my bag, ayy
Ran it up and gave 'em a sad face
Now anywhere around the globe
You rep the gang and you got rank, yeah
Gotta converse with the manager
When I walk inside the bank, yeah
Who would ever think they was sleepin' on me?
Goyard with a half a million on me
R&D's, it's like I'm possessed
All these diamonds on my chest

Awww, oh
Awww, oh
Awww, oh
Awww

Runnin' through the red light, peekin' through the rearview
Niggas might just run up on the car and try to spray you

Aw, they ain't think I'm gettin' my bag, ayy
Ran it up and gave 'em a sad face
Who would ever think they'd ever sleep on me?
Who would ever?
Who would ever think they'd sneak diss me?
Who would ever?
Ah, these bitches are possessed
By these VVS' glarin' off my chest
Awww, oh
