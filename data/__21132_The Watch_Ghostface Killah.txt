15 ContributorsThe Watch Lyrics
Tony for mayor.. (x4)

Catch me in a crisp blue six, deep dish
Jaws is Cris', velour stopped at the wrist
Watches involved, talk to me Trick Daddy
I liked the way you tilt ya hat up in that Caddy
Son, can't believe you the most slept on
Took a break since the Cuban, niggas lookin' like you just repped wrong
You done slipped down a bid, got caught with the hammer
Steal banners, medical examiners, clocked live hammers
For real, you a live nigga, rock the five in ya slippers
Like them other five guys in ya picture
Come on, watch, I'm the star of the show, so blow dem
Mothafucka, you ain't blew in three years
Son of a bitch, that's why I rock the big shit
Don't forget who you is, nigga, you my little shit
I will crush you to pieces, stop ya heart from tickin'
And you mad cuz you a older clock, couple rocks missin'
And my Breitling, the band, you can say it's ice lightnin'
You don't like him, do you? You wanna fight him
In fact, I should've put you back, relaxed on the stones
And copped ya two-thousand leather shit, snow cones
A bowl of milk almost killed you, ah, you almost drowned in my Pops
I brought another box, I'mma keep it real with you
And I'mma murder you if ya bitch-ass get on my nerves again
You might also like
Yo, Ghost, you'se a funny nigga
Turn on the radio, all you hear is X and Jigga
Haha, you vexed, nigga?
No airplay (bet my gat spray) Yeah, that's hearsay
You spray hairspray and up North, nigga, you ain't gettin' jailplay
(How you know?) Yo, it's obvious, clear as day

Hold on, let me park my shit, let me find out this nigga barkin' and shit
I'm a Don of this shit, and you know that shit I wrote with Golden Arms is a hit
My Wallos show off, go off like an alarm in the six
Drapped in yellow and I'm still poppin'
My movie life in the hood is like an ill doctrine
Beat trial with a legal aide, fuck Cochrane
And if it's on I might blow you if I'm boxed in.. {*echoes*}

Yo, yo, yo, what you doin', man?
Yo, man, chill out, man
(Don't even worry)
I'm just fuckin' with you, man
Why you.. (OK) Come on, son
We can't.. don't depart us like this, son
Come on (I'll destroy you)
Come on, man (You pop too much shit)
Come on, man, I'm just tellin' you time
(I ain't a-like that, you know who brought you)
Nigga, I'm just fuckin' with you
(Bye!)
Tony for mayor..

Yo, let me tell y'all mothafuckas somethin'
(Shoot one of those niggas, Lord)
We could battle for belts, ice (Type shit)
Whatever the fuck you want to do
Let me tell y'all somethin'
This the Theodore Unit, mothafucka
We takin' the bait of this shit
That's word to my momma, man
(Staten Island, nigga, what, nigga?)
Coke, spoon throwers (Get ya money right)
(Gotta know how real do this)
Slew-footed mothafuckas, I pop all y'all niggas
Y'all niggas is fucked, straight up
We back in here now, mothafuckas
It's the fuckin' Unit, you heard
That's the Theodore Unit
Y'all mothafuckas better recognize
Aight? That's my word
(Yeah, nigga, yeah)Embed
