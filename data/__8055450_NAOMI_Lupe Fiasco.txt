43 ContributorsNAOMI Lyrics
Can you see it? You see it
I know you see it, uh
Signs of intelligent life
Mosquito nets repel anopheles bites, look at the night
Nice, we look alike, they want a slice of your dreams
Even Christ took a knife for the team, so swing
Yo, fatal flying guillotine, uh, yeah

I just come around to help like Batman utility belt
All by myself with the world on my delts
We can chill while it melts, the beat bill feel like it's felt
My suspicion Christians killed all the Celts
What else? What elsе? Forget what happened in thе past
You gotta let it go like what happened to the gas
Can't have such anathema inside a mass
It'll ruin your communion and soil all of your fast
Stay away from rebels worshipping the devil like jazz
When Heaven loses a job, Hell wins staff
Looking over macroeconomic math
Counting, weighting, and calculating how much time that we have
Then put it all in a graph, look at all of the paths
But look at Instagram then go back and split it in half
I ain't rapping, what's happened is blowing glass
Trakk is tapping drums and Crystal's blowing the brass
Per the usual
All that beautiful musical moving you like a inter-cooled Subaru
With an Italian man saying, "Look at what I do for you"
A nice Chicken Vesuvio
Be in North Boston often
'Round them Sicilians I be walking like the ambiance and talking
My favorite part is when all of the affogatos is brought in
You can put Dolce vita chicken risotto in my coffin
It's a—, ayy
You might also like
We are in the building, yes
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah

I was in Roxbury on Malcolm X block
Talking that talk that got Malcolm X watched
Tryna pick up where Malcolm X stopped
Only game I play is a Malcolm Xbox
Look in the sky, see the Malcolm X ring
Malcolm X-files, it's a Malcolm X thing
As you ask yourself, "What does Malcolm X mean?"
I return to the force in a Malcolm X-Wing
And scene

You know they want a slice of your dreams
But even Christ took a knife for the team
So, swing5Embed
