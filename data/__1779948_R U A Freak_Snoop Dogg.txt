18 ContributorsR U A Freak Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

Hurry, hurry
Write your number on the napkin right now
And if you feel it, let me hear you say, "Oh"
Cause I gotta go
Something's burning
You see the party people rocking side to side
And if you feel it, let me hear you say, "Oh"
Cause I gotta know

She's DTF cause she's down to feel
That aromatic, knot unlocking, baby this is for real
Are you a freak, or what?
I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut, you crack me up
Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see, eye to eye?

You must let go of that mind control
That's coming out your television and radio
You must escape (Say what?) escape from here!
Get intelligent when you hit that shit and let it go (Blow)
Far from here, let it go (Just blow)
Let it go
You might also like
She's DTF cause she's down to feel
That aromatic, knot unlocking, baby this is for real
Are you a freak, or what?
I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut, you crack me up
Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see, eye to eye?

You try to survive
You're under pressure cause you're running outta time
But this is not a chance you wanna blow
Cause we gotta go
The deed is murder
You think long, you've been wrong, get it out your mind
Make you move when you hear them screaming, "Ho"
Cause I gotta go

She's DTF cause she's down to feel
That aromatic, knot unlocking, baby this is for real
Are you a freak, or what?
I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut, you crack me up
Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see, eye to eye?
Why don't you sway, sway side to side? (Side to side)
Dip, dip, glide and glide
Sway, sway side to side (Side to side)
Dip, dip, do it one more time
Why don't you sway, sway side to side? (Side to side)
Dip, dip, glide and glide
Sway, sway side to side (Side to side)
Dip, dip, baby let that ride (Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah)10Embed
