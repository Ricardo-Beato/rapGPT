M-M-M-Murda
Yeah

Hold up, hold up (Hold up, hold up)
Get right witcha (I'ma get right witcha)
Bad bitches, fuck 'em then dismiss 'em (Bad, woo)
I ain't really here to take no pictures (Flash)
Middle finger up, fuck the system (Fuck 'em)

Yeah, coupe is robotic, I ain't touchin' (Nah, skrt)
Lookin' at your hoe because she is bustin' (Ye, woo)
Ridin' in the coupe with the wings (Ye, brrt)
Goin' to Chi-land with them chinks (Ye, chinks)
Percocet party, servin' fiends (Perky!)
Swear to God my plug was Vietnamese (Brrt brrt brrt)
Taliban, my drugs, wrap 'em, please (Taliban)
Servin' all day, my gas on E (Let's go)
Thirty hollow tips in extendo (Bow, thirty, brrt)
Shadows keep wavin' by my window (Woo, shadows)
Thankin' God, he saved my life from kick doors (God!)
Still sippin' oil, Migos Citgo (Drank, gone)

Hold up, hold up (Yeah)
Get right witcha (I'ma get right witcha)
Bad bitches, fuck 'em then dismiss 'em (Bad, woo)
I ain't really here to take no pictures (Flash)
Middle finger up, fuck the system (Fuck 'em)
Get right witcha (I'ma get right witcha)
Get right witcha (I'ma get right witcha)
Hold up, get right witcha (I'ma get right witcha)

Thirty round extension for the tension (Brrt)
Hundred round drum, listen
