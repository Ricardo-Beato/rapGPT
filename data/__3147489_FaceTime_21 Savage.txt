Mustard on the beat, ho

Henny in my system, I'm gone (I'm gone)
Speedin' on the E way, all gone (gone)
Girl you put up with that nigga? You strong (you strong)
Ain't no need to play games, I'm grown (I'm grown)
Out there cheating, man, it turn ya heart cold (heart cold)
She don't wanna hear the lies this old (this old)
Takin' shots even when it's too strong (too strong)
Fuck a nigga, lick her, make her moan (her moan)
Gotta get up in the mornin', she grown (she grown)
I be drankin', I be drivin', I'm wrong (I'm wrong)
Had a long day at work and I know (I Know)
I can't text my girl, I'm on my way home (way home)

I'm too drunk to text so can we FaceTime? (FaceTime)
I won't waste your time if you don't waste mine (don't waste mine)
Girl I wanna taste yours if you gon' taste mine (taste mine)
I won't take your love for granted if you don't take mine (take mine)

Fuck the summer, girl I ball all season (all season)
She don't want me to think that she easy (she easy)
But she ain't tryna make it seem like she teasin' (she teasin')
We just chillin' at the bar and she cheesin' (she cheesin')
Buy a hundred shots for no reason (reason)

Brown liquor got her panties leakin' (leakin')
That nigga stealin' pussy, he thiefin' (he thiefin')

Let me swim inside your pool, yeah, the deep end (deep end)
And we can get drunk all weekend (weekend)
