Oh shit, oh, oh shit
Ah, shit (Ah, shit)
Ah, shit
Ah, shit (No)
Ah, shit
Ah, shit
Ah, shit (Uh)
Ah, shit (Ah, shit)
Ah, shit (Shit, ah, shit)
Ah, shit (Ah, shit)
Ah, shit

Uh, little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
Oh, how I tossed that ass up
Like a mission in the woods, Woody Woodpecker would
If he could, but I didn't wanna pass it up
To the next man, had my Walkman bumpin'
On the fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a killer thriller, driller tiller, out with the Miller brew
Fill her up, took it 'til the damn Dutch puked
Luke Skywalker ain't a sweet talker, so I got ill
With my lightsaber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst
The night felt good but the day got worse
I thought I was alone, Slim Tre the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school saying, "Ooh," and I'm busted for real
(He came and went at the same time)
You might also like
Oh, shit (Oh, shit)
Oh, shit
Oh, shit

What to say the least
I'm so slick that they need to call me, "Grease"
'Cause I slips and I slides
When I rides on the beast
Imani and your mom, sittin' in a tree
K-I-S-S (I-N-G)
Yo, first comes the tongue, and then comes the she
My homey's M-O-M, what? (M-I-E)
Yo, and to think to day one
In my eyes, I show fear
'Cause I stepped into his house
His mom's grinnin' ear-to-ear
Gigglin' and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin' me up for the kill
"Oh, what the hell," is what I said to myself
So that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch
And wish Greg would please hurry, what? (Up)
She offered me a cup of Ripple
Broke out the titty, squeezed her nipples
Said, "Suck it if you like, but please don't bite it"
I had an urge to say, "Fuck it," but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say, "Alakazam, carpet now"
I took this old bitch in the doggie style
Greg walked in the room, that nigga cold had a fit, yo
But all this numbskull could say was, "Oh, shit"
(What's the matter, mama?)
Oh, shit, oh, shit
(What's the matter, mama?)
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh shit, oh, shâ€”
(Son of a bitch)
(Son of a bitch, come on)

One fine summertime, Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple Samurai Suzuki
Dookie braids was the aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope
Man, real dope, on the real
Well anyway, I went, "Toot-toot"
She said, "Hey, beep, beep"
The next day, rolled down to the beach
Tuesday, me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty
Suck-suck-suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (Why?)
'Cause every time I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like, "Quit, hehe"
Bitch was frontin', but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden, after someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me, "Oh, please, God, no"
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go
Shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit6Embed
