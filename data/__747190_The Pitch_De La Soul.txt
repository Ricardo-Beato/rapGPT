4 ContributorsThe Pitch Lyrics
A Nubian sprocket is the one
Plug One, cut the cap
Forward is the marcher of the chant
Now to the clan, unless you slept
Willy to the Wonka of the feast
Smoke your blunts, but close your drapes
And if we get fined by police
Don't sweat it, yo, I got papes
Toxic is the talk that I tell
The note be held by the lady who's fat
Chris made the dope beat for no Bo Peeps
And you can't beat that, that's a fact

He's no batter, he's no batter, batter
He's no batter, he's no batter
(Here comes the pitch)

Swingin' with that good old step
It's Plus Dos, groove a gut
On gets by when it's kept
Three miles to my strut
Forgivin' them fools that's false
I cook goose, serve a plate
Position is never at a loss
No cost, no relate
See Dave's got a badge of his own
Cause the link in the life got slack
I'm lick it down to the Tootsie Pop
And you can't beat that with a bat
You might also like

Swing, yea
This how we do it, De La y'all
We just ride, and take the train, take the train
Take the train, take the train
Take the train, take the trainEmbed
