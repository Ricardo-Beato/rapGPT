22 ContributorsThe Problem Lyrics
Look, pour me a drink
I don't do liquor, I know what you think
This is a vibe
This that shit that make niggas get fly and go on a date
Fly to Dubai, order a steak
I got a shawty, she told me she loved me
I know that she mean it, don't know what to say
She want a nigga to go all the way
She want a—
She want that feelin' that she on a mission to find what she missin'
She need the commitment but don't wanna wait
I need a break, I need (A break)
She need a hubby
I wish I could love like I did in my twenties
I wish I was me back when I had no money
I wish I could give her all that she want from me
And I know it hurts (Yeah)
I got a diamond, don't know what it's worth
Don't know what is worse
Sleepin' alone or sleepin' with someone you know you gon' hurt
Layin' with somеone you know that you killin'
And deep down inside, you know that she willin' to stay and just ridе
Just hopin' that one day this shit'll be fine
But what if it isn't? Or what if I'm wrong?
What am I missin'? Where do I belong?
She got a vision and I never listen
I think I been lookin' for somethin' that never existed
I'm dealin' with scars that never be fixin'
I know that I'm guilty of every conviction (Yeah)
Now how can I look in the mirror and talk to myself
When I know I ain't ready to listen or ready to fix it? (Woo)
You might also like
I just packed the ride (Woo)
That's a vibe
I ain't perfect, but I try
She said, “That's a lie
You know you just sabotage” (Hey)
Girl, you cold
You know I'm in love with you but I ain't done bein' a ho

I got a shawty beside of me (Woo)
She ain't got shit that she proud of me (Hey)
She never trip up or lie to me
She never bicker or brother me (Buck)
I got a bitch with a Rolls-Royce
She wanna pull up beside of me (Woah)
She never get in my way
And don't ever complain about spendin' no time with me
I got a, I got a shawty that give me up (Hey)
I don't need no one to trip me up (Yeah)
Too many hoes wanna keep me down
I got a bitch that'll pick me up
She wanna suck me and lick me up (Woah)
I got a ho that'll spoil me
Treat me like royalty
I gotta live it up (Woah)
None of these women can get enough
I got a, I got a shawty with hella ambition
Somebody who trust and believe in my vision
And keep to herself and don't be in my business
Won't talk to nobody, not even my niggas (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I swear that her booty's a heavy addiction
I just wanna hit it in every position
I'm very consistent
I don't wanna cuddle, she very submissive with every decision (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And shawty a boss
She got my, she got my back and she ‘bout it (Yeah)
If I try to pay for the bill, she tell me, “Don't worry, my nigga, I got it” (Got it)
Baddest lil' bitch in the Hills, her body amazin', I'm talkin' exotic (You heard?)
Shawty be cookin' me meals and fuckin' me crazy
I'm talkin' demonic, I'm talkin' neurotic
But I ain't in love with these bitches, I'm not gonna reach (Woo, woo, woo)
I hate that the woman I love has gotta compete (Woo, woo, woo)
But I'm tryna figure the reason I’m incomplete
Nobody perfect and not even me
I figured all of these hoes can solve the problem, well maybe the problem is me
Hey, babe (Hey, babe)
I just found love and I never had a love like you
Hey, babe (Hey, babe)
I just found love and I never had a love like you
Baby (Baby)
I just want love and I never had a love like you
Baby (Baby)
I just found love and I never had someone like you
(I keep fallin', I keep fallin')
Lately
I been on the drugs and I never had no one like you
(I keep fallin', I keep fallin')
Baby
I been down on luck and I been out on us like you
(I keep fallin', I keep fallin')
Lately
I been on the drugs and I never had no one like you
(I keep fallin', I keep fallin')
Baby
I can't fall in love and know I can love like

I just found love and I never had a love like you
I just want love and I never had a love like you
Baby (Baby)1Embed
