5 ContributorsClub On Smash Lyrics
I’m smoking on that good kush
Got this shit on smash
Freebandz
Take it to the next level

Got the club on smash, Got the club on smash
Valet know what, Thug boy know what, Thug girl know what, bad bitch know what
Got the club on smash, Got the club on smash
Popping all the bottles, smokin’ all the kush
I got all my money, it ain’t even on me

Margiela I’m getting bezels, make it rain no umbrella
Bad bitch like Cinderella, bad bitch I intercept her
Rich nigga wanna tell you bout her back seat of a Eddie Bauer
Whipping up two hundred thousand
Whipping up two hundred thousand
Strong kush and that lean nigga
We toasting up in my V.I.P. (Lean)
Gold bottles all in my head, got red bottoms all on my feet
Rich bitch all on my line, Presidential all on my shine
Spent a dub on Jimmy heels and killed the game like Columbine
Love a nigga just like me, pulling up in them new trucks (Straight up)
Ball like I’m in the NBA (Straight up) got a hundred niggas they gone shoot
Hundred niggas and we all rich hundred thousand get blowed nigga on a weekend
Got Benjamins and Franklins
You might also like
Got the club on smash, Got the club on smash
Valet know what, Thug boy know what, Thug girl know what, bad bitch know what
Got the club on smash, Got the club on smash
Popping all the bottles, smokin’ all the kush
I got all my money, it ain’t even on me

My car just did the roll bounce
Got Sandals with the toes out (Trippin’)
Alligator Mozart they bite a nigga like
Everything new to me, rims and my jewelry
Winter time AC, top off in December
Taliban Cheddar, European Sweater
YSL cheetah, flyer than a eagle
She got on Prada then I put her in Prada
I’m with my partner man we throwing up that guala (Throwing up that guala)
We in this bitch we drunk we drank out the bottle
We don't use no chaser my nigga we drink out the bottle
She got no panties on, no panties onnn
She wanna take me home, take me home, take me home

Got the club on smash, Got the club on smash
Valet know what, Thug boy know what
Thug girl know what, bad bitch know what
Got the club on smash, Got the club on smash
Popping all the bottles, smokin’ all the kush
I got all my money, it ain’t even on meEmbed
