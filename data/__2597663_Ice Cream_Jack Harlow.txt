15 ContributorsIce Cream Lyrics
Know she wanna fuck with a fella like me, (me)
They don't know for sure, but they can tell I might be, (hey)
The mutherfuckin' man, when I pull up on the spot
Got the kids goin' wild like I'm sellin' ice cream
Like I'm, like I'm sellin' ice cream, (cream)
I don't really know how I can tell 'em nicely
I'm the prince of my city, yeah they know about the kid
You a tourist in this bitch doin' hella sight seein'

We been on the move for a minute now, (ey)
Movin' through the city with the windows down, (ey)
Only got a couple months till we graduate so, (so)
Ain't nobody out here really tryna sit around, (ey)
I just hit her phone with that "WYD", (yeh)
She said, "Boy I'm down, if you wanna come find me", (cool)
I said, "Watchu wearing girl? There's something I'm tryna see"
Told me, "Come and get it", said she wanna surprise me
Bet, give me like an hour and a half
With the homies right now and we bout to get a snack, (yoh)
In the mean time, you can take a shower or a bath
And relax, wait for me, I'll be out there in a dash, (yoh)
Close knit, how we sharin' the wealth
I can see that they don't like how we carry ourselves
You can tell by how we act, we don't care how they felt
I can see it in your eyes that you're scared of yourself, you lil'
You might also like
Know she wanna fuck with a fella like me
They don't know for sure, but they can tell I might be
The mutherfuckin' man, when I pull up on the spot
Got the kids goin' wild like I'm sellin' ice cream
Like I'm, like I'm sellin' ice cream
I don't really know how I can tell 'em nicely
I'm the prince of my city, yeah they know about the kid
You a tourist in this bitch doin' hella sight seein'

We been laid back, lookin' for some things to do
Pull up at the party, now it's lookin' like a kangaroo
Remember when I used to never get the invite
Now I'm the motherfucker that these people wanna cater to
Smooth criminal, y'all are too cynical
Hottest in my city I ain't even hit my pinnacle, (yeh)
First round draft pick, you might get your ass kicked
Post up, step back, every move is pivotal
And I got the people sayin', "Why the boy is so lyrical?", (what!)
They hatin' on me, but they still enjoy what they hearin' tho
Honestly, I think you need that shit I pour in my cereal
She ain't tryna hook up with me cause I'm boyfriend material, cool
But now she pullin' on my cardigan
Dick went soft, but I think it's gettin' hard again
The people that I started with, the ones I'm bout to party with
And we gon' stay away from anyone who wasn't a part of it
Know she wanna fuck with a fella like me
They don't know for sure, but they can tell I might be
The mutherfuckin' man, when I pull up on the spot
Got the kids goin' wild like I'm sellin' ice cream
Like I'm, like I'm sellin' ice cream
I don't really know how I can tell 'em nicely
I'm the prince of my city, yeah they know about the kid
You a tourist in this bitch doin' hella sight-seein'1Embed
