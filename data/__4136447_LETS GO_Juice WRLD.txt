22 ContributorsLETS GO Lyrics
Uh, she'll kill me if she heard it (Kill me if she heard it)
She’ll kill me if she heard it (She kill me if she heard it)
Ayy, bitch, you kill me (I am, no, no)
She'll kill me if she heard I was poppin' ecstasy (Yeah)

She’ll kill me if she heard I was poppin' ecstasy (Yeah)
Or amphetamine medicine, but I been stressin' out
I'ma blame it on the government, yeah, it's the men again
They treat us niggas just like mannequins, we just get tossed around
Even when a nigga president (I am), they still gon' fuck around
Bein' sober is an understatement, but it's overrated
I’m smokin’ 'til my eyes are bleedin’ and my head is blazin'
I'm poppin' ’til my hands are shakin' and my heart is racin', yeah (Yeah)
I need molly, molly, molly, let's get wasted, yeah (Let's get wasted, yeah)
I— I felt the temperature drop, I hear what you sayin' and I understand (I am)
I get it, I get it, I know I should stop (Oh no)
I need a way to get back to the top (Yeah)
I need a way to get outta this slump (Yeah)
I need a way to get way out and stay out and build up a layout to fuck up the world
I go political for the publicity, I'ma get ignorant just for the industry (Woah, woah, woah)
I get chaotic to match all the chaos and I'ma get radical just for my enemies (Woah, woah, woah)
Fuck it, I'm fucked up, I know it, I know it (Woah, woah, woah)
Lookin' like what in the fuck's gotten into me (I am)
I said the Hennesy mixed with the Rémy's the remedy
Look at your boy doin' chemistry (Woah)

This shit is so fuckin' sick, haha

Screamin', "Fuck everything", you feel me?
You gotta live your life, like, like it's yours, you feel me?
Don't give a fuck about nothin', bro, just do you

I'ma turn up 'til I can't do it no more (I am)
I'ma fuck her 'til I can't do it no more (I am)
This is real life, this is not a promo (No, no)

Perfect, I'ma pop a Percocet (I am)
I'ma pour me up some purple shit to find some perfectness (I will)
I mean all these niggas clowns, take 'em to the circuses (Yeah)
And I swear this case is closed like the fuckin' curtains is (Yeah)
That means that I would play, but you be on your actin' shit (You do)
I got brothas movin' packages and poppin' Xe mints (Yeah)
Want that work, they give it to you, ain't no fuckin' estimate
