(Young Chop on the beat)
She say you be stuntin', bitch, that's every day (BandKamp)
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day
Every day, every day (Sosa baby)
Every day (GBE baby, every day shit, baby)
She wanna chill with Sosa but not every day

I be smokin' dope, shit, that's every day (Smokin' dope)
300 swole, bitch, we be up in the place (300)
Don't care what you say, shit, that's every day (Nah)
Sosa always with this nigga shit, that's every day (Sosa)
Can't compare to I, 'cause I'm hot as fuck (Nah)
I'm buyin' foreign cars and some Tonka trucks (Yoom)
No snitchin', boy, we light you up (Bang bang)
Shoot them bullets, ain't nobody hot as us (Grraah)
I'm a Leo, but my fuckin' birthday every day (Let's get it)
Hope I be at the awards fuckin' Mary Kate (Let's get it)
I'm a Leo, but my fuckin' birthday every day (Go, go)
Hope I be at the awards fuckin' Mary Kate (Go, go)

She say you be stuntin', bitch, that's every day
All my money go on dope, shit, that's every day (Ftftft)
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day (Nah)
Fuck on any nigga bitch, shit, that's every day (Let's get it)
Every day, every day (Let's get it)
Every day, every day (Day)
Every day, every day (Let's get it)
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day (Day)

OTF, bitch, I rep that shit like every day
GBE, bitch, I rep that shit like every day
If you think it's chicken then it's bombs away
Ringin' down your block, make you run away
Man, I get so high I can't pronounciate
Run up in your house, "Where your money safe?"
We be makin' moves, shit, that's every day
I don't stack money, I spend it in every way
Damn, all this money on my landline
Up all day, bitch, we don't sleep, we vampires
Forty on my hip, click clack then fire
We don't do this everyday, you's a damn liar

She say you be stuntin', bitch, that's every day
All my money go on dope, shit, that's every day (Ftftft)
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day (Nah)
Fuck on any nigga bitch, shit, that's every day (Let's get it)
Every day, every day (Let's get it)
Every day, every day (Day)
Every day, every day (Let's get it)
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day (Day)

Every day
Every day
Every day
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day21Embed
