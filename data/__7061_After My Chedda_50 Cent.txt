16 ContributorsAfter My Chedda Lyrics
Yeah, Shout out to Chris Lighty! Violator!
You know how I put it down when I put it down nigga, let's go!

When you frown at me, is it 'cause I won't provide for you girl?
You're after my cheddar
And you friends they see it too
Screaming we know what your up to do
I'm after my cheddar

I gave you your style, Gucci this, Fendi that
Burberry bag, shoes and the hat to match
I like the way it look but bitch I ain't buying that
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but no more Prada shoes
When I just wanna chill you wanna go out
See me polly with some other chick you wanna show out
You say I'm wrong when I dog yo' ass like I should
Now you can reminisce on the times I treated you good

When you frown at me, is it 'cause I won't provide for you girl?
You're after my cheddar
And you friends they see it too
Screaming we know what your up to do
I'm after my cheddar
You might also like
Yeah, uh
Look, for you to think about me grinding my fans
You either got more than one watch on or it's too much time on your hands
They say behind every good man is a woman
So if Task pull up, stash the cannon in ya linen
I'll never be your chauffeur to the mall
So learn to appreciate the CD's and posters on the wall
Fatal attraction is mad real
The last bitch I deaded went crazy and swallowed 50 Advil

When you frown at me, is it 'cause I won't provide for you girl?
You're after my cheddar
And you friends they see it too
Screaming we know what your up to do
I'm after my cheddar

They say money make the world go round
And material things make a ho go down
I see you in your Prada, Gucci, and BCBG
Bitch I'm getting rich, but I don't trick on GP
That's 5 dollar dresses and 10 dollar skirts
Bitch play the strip and put in work
Birds wanna have my baby since I signed my contract
Now I got to double up in case the condom snap
When you frown at me, is it 'cause I won't provide for you girl?
You're after my cheddar
And you friends they see it too
Screaming we know what your up to do
I'm after my cheddar

Look don't ask me for shit man
I ain't got nothing for you man what?
Bitch what the fuck you mean I can't sing bitch
Bitch I'm Luther Vandross in the shower
