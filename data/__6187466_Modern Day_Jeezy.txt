6 ContributorsModern Day Lyrics
Woo, yeah
Cannon
Being black nigga, it's like a modern-day crime
M-m-m-modern day crime

They say I fell off, I bounce back, I got it in me
Hustle fully automatic, dawg, don't do no semi (Yah)
Seven-day grind theory, dawg, Hustleveli ('Veli)
That's why I got that thug motivation 'cross my belly (Yeah)
You confusin' me with them dawg? Must be a mix-up
Lots to celebrate, yeah, pour me up a big cup (Yeah)
Nigga I ain't dead, I ain't in the penitentiary
All the shit I did, yeah, I could've did a century (Talk that shit, nigga)
Nigga I was plottin' on missing elementary
Third period holdin' my vision, pockеts empty (Damn)
Please don't tеll me I can't do it, that will tempt me (Tempt me)
What you know about adversity? I tell 'em plenty (Let's go)

All these chains on, feel like a modern-day slave (Slave)
Ten-year sentence, that's a modern-day grave (What's up?)
Real estate nigga, that's a modern-day flex
Seven-figure nigga, that's a modern-day check (Let's go)
Self-made nigga, that's a modern-day grind (Haha)
Being black nigga, that's a modern-day crime (Yeah)
If he got a badge, that's a modern-day opp (Opp)
Motivation 'cross my belly, like a modern-day 'Pac (Let's go)

A soldier dies one time, coward dies a million
Came back reincarnated, what a feelin' (Damn)
Forever I'm immortal, nah, you can't kill my spirit (Nah)
Why they always hatin' on your name? 'Cause they fear it (Believe that shit, nigga)
Give them all of me, like John, I'm a legend (Legend)
Word to Bush, drug war nigga, I'm a veteran (Haha)
Post-traumatic stress, for the pain I need some morphine
Cash rules everything around me, need some more cream
If I die tonight, wonder if heaven got a ghetto (Ghetto)
Me and my girlfriend on brown liquor, gettin' mellow (Boo)
Sippin' brown, blowin' green, yeah that's thug passion (Yeah)
Y'all thought that I was done-done? That's all a thug askin'

All these chains on, feel like a modern-day slave (Slave)
Ten-year sentence, that's a modern-day grave (What's up?)
Real estate nigga, that's a modern-day flex
Seven figure nigga, that's a modern-day check (Let's go)
Self-made nigga, that's a modern-day grind (Haha)
Being black nigga, that's a modern-day crime (Yeah)
If he got a badge, that's a modern-day opp (Opp)
Motivation 'cross my belly, like a modern-day 'Pac (Let's go)

All these chains on, feel like a modern-day slave
Like, like a modern-day slave
Being black nigga, it's like a modern-day crime
M-m-modern-day crime
Self-made nigga, that's a modern-day grind
M-m-modern-day grind
Being black nigga, it's like a modern-day crime
I'm like modern day 'PacEmbed
