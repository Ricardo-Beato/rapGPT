10 ContributorsWalnuts Lyrics
Know how we rocking, man, we going nuts, man
Going nuts, man, fucking sluts, man
Fucking up these bucks, man, copping mansions, man
Flexing on these overgrown goofy ass niggas, going walnuts

Going walnuts, ayy
I'm going walnuts, ayy
Bitch, I'm going walnuts
Bitch, I'm going walnuts
I can't eat no walnuts
But guess what? Bitch, I'm going walnuts
I'm going so nuts, I'm going walnuts, ayy
Going Planters, going walnuts
Going cashews, going walnuts, ayy

She want credit, I am not a cashier
Free promotion, I don't know, that's weird
She want me to fuck her, that’s my thot from last year
Ayy, I can’t do that shit, that’s backwards
We going forward with this shit
I'm buying toys with this shit
I'm buying guns with this shit, ayy
I'm getting funds off this shit, ayy
She gotta suck on my dick, ayy
Just to step in my crib, ayy, ayy
Bitch, my crib is two mill, ayy
Or three mill, I really don't know what it is, ayy, ayy
But I'm fucking rolling hard
I'm still up, 7 o'clock AM
I'm thinking about mayhem, spray him
Sosa only pull up if they pay him
Smoking trees, getting top like lollipop
I still want some fucking more zombie top
But I already fucked, ayy
I got a new mansion, she was at my other one, ayy
I think she like my shower, ayy, ayy
She went in 'bout a hour, ayy, ayy
We fucked for 'bout some hours, ayy
She was counting her singles up on my money counter, ayy
You smoke sativa, I smoke downers, ayy
Too much damn THC, I'ma lunger, ayy
I'ma get that chopper, I'ma lumber
And niggas won't be talking no damn longer, ayy
I fucked DMX baby mama, ayy
Ladera, Shakira, or whatever that bitch name is
She threw it back for me
I hit her, I sent that bitch a plane ticket
I'm smoking Mary Jane, nigga
Bling all in my chain, nigga
Where that chain come from? Johnny Dang, nigga
Gang, nigga
Gun bang like my chop Wayne, nigga
They like, "Sosa, you think you Wayne, nigga?"
Hell nah, that's my nigga though, gang, nigga
Bang, niggaYou might also like2Embed
