(BGudini, spell that shit)

S-U-C-C-E-S-S, havin' success
B-L-E-S-S, yes, niggas is blessed
Ten toes down, that's a bag in Atlanta (Ten toes)
It ain't no pressure, but you still keep a hammer (No, no)
Bitches on bitches, like to fuck they friends
They done lowered their standards and errybody cool with it
Young niggas sending them shots, just bought a new chopper
He'll show you he a fool with it
Which one ya on? Body for body, we havin' bags full of bones (Bones)
Came back rich, woulda thought it was a clone
All these za' bags, woulda thought it home grown
Huncho the chief, had to send it to Mahomes
Franchisе tag, everybody want a loan (Mahomes)

Wе kicked the door down and we made some money
And we left it open for y'all to come in
Gave 'em the blueprint to shake the whole world
And even done showed 'em the robotic Benz
Mama, she told me to watch for the enemies
Even the ones you call your friends
Charge it to the game, or call it a penalty
Fuck it, I'll switch it up and come back again (Woo)
Every time I'm up, man, I know I'm up ten (Ten)
Nigga can get close, I'll stretch it out again (Stretch)
Came from the trap, never trapped in a pin (No)
But I send big care packs to the pen' (Pen')
Gang for the win, gang for the win (Win)
Take' and Offset, they'll stain sum'n, twin (Twin)
Creepin' at night, we were walkin' with revenge ('Venge)
Jason with a knife, we were walkin' with grin (Grin)
Who was Montana? Tony Montana wouldn't live one night if he stayed in Atlanta
You tryna go viral, leave ya name on a banner
Nigga want smoke, but it's all in the camera

Came back rich, woulda thought it was a clone
All these za' bags, woulda thought it home grown
Huncho the chief, had to send it to Mahomes (Hey)
Franchise tag, everybody want a loan (Offset)

Gang, we The Beatles (Gang), in ya' vein like a needle (Vein)
Fast like a cheetah when I hit the gas, I'ma leave 'em (Skrrt)
Buckle down with the band' like we playin' on a seesaw (Woo)
Can't forget my man, I put them bands on a Kia (Racks)
We was beatin' niggas with our bare hands, show what we 'bout (Yessir)
Niggas sellin' grubs, I had to hustle outta FILAs (Hustle)
Knew I wanted money, I was five, I was knee-high (Five)
I'ma have to keep her, I ain’t going out like B-I (Fire)
Major lil' nigga, lil' basic lil' nigga (Basic)
We was in the basement hidin' paper, they ain't listen (Hey)
My wrist blowin' kisses, we done fucked all your bitches (Come here)
Necklace, look like I just got out a blizzard (Ice)
Bad bitch, bought a lil' Chanel, cost a nickel (Baddie)
Told the bitch to ride this shit, bicycle (Ride)
Supersize Lambo, wide body, whip it (Wide)
I put a lil' switch up on the Glock, I'm tryna zip 'em (Frr)
We put on the move and put the thottie on to kill 'em (Thottie)
Went and bought the buildin', it's some million dollar dealings (Yeah)
I ain't worried 'bout a pussy nigga, drop my ceilin' (No)
Hibernate the millions, Nawfside legends (Nawf)
S-U-C-C-E-S-S, havin' success

Came back rich, woulda thought it was a clone
All these za' bags, woulda thought it home grown
Huncho the chief, had to send it to Mahomes
Franchise tag, everybody want a loan (Takeoff)

Franchise player, had to send it to Mahomes
Never send it through your phone, had to get it on my own (Get it)
I know right from wrong, but I'm playin' all along
Never show 'em your emotions and tell 'em what you be on
It'll fuck your mind up when your bag get blown (Bag)
Depend on who the person, gotta be mentally strong (Strong)
You just gotta run it up and never ever fold (No)
Pickin' up a load, never askin' for a loan (Never)
B-L-E-S-S, niggas is blessed (Blessed)
Flickin' through a check while I'm sittin' on a jet (Jet)
Niggas flex for the net, it's some niggas I ain't met (Never)
I can up a milli' if I ever get depressed (Milli')
I bought the semi and you know I can suppress (Brrt)
And every time I see the bag, I see another one
Shoutout to Khaled 'cause they know that we the best
I know some niggas that be hatin' on success (Hatin')
I know my niggas, they be prayin' for the best (Pray)
Niggas throwin' salt cause they got less (Throwin')
Ain't get no straightenin' when a nigga got pressed (Pressed)
S-U-C-C-E-S-S, havin' success
B-L-E-S-S, yes, niggas is blessed
Ten toes down, that's a bag in Atlanta (Ten toes)
It ain't no pressure, but you still keep a hammer (No, no)
Bitches on bitches, like to fuck they friends
They done lowered their standards and errybody cool with it
Young niggas sending them shots, just bought a new chopper
He'll show you he a fool with it
Which one ya on? Body for body, we havin' bags full of bones (Bones)
Came back rich, woulda thought it was a clone
All these za' bags, woulda thought it home grown
Huncho the chief, had to send it to Mahomes
Franchise tag, everybody want a loan (Mahomes)

If you really want it, you ain't get it on your own
You ain't got time to be callin' nigga phone
Still gotta get it in the field, you ain't did nothin' wrong
Say you really want it, you'll get it on your own
Still, yeah, if he ain't really got it I'll give it to Mahomes1Embed
