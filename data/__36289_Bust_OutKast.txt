41 ContributorsBust Lyrics
Ghosts and goblins run amok
In the caverns of rhine
Slinging petty corruption
The seventh sign

Give it (Yeah)
Give it to you (To you)
And I do what it takes
To give it to you (Bust)
(Bust)

Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we care
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was underprepared
But my hunger is the thunder, no wonder it can't be smothered
Or buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce
You a Chuck E. Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm tryna tell you now is that you're softer than soft
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?
Your predicaments flawed, flaw means fucked up
And serving out the oven not fried, slow roast
No coast, tuck your tail and hide
You scared?
You might also like
Give it (Yeah)
Give it to you (To you)
And I do what it takes
To give it to you (Bust)
(Bust)

I officially do it with guns on tour
We lock down traps, push caps galore
My wiz cook work until it scale like fish
My old earth even known to handle biz
I serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash
Usually keep a G-pack on the dash
Try to test my gangsta, I bring harm
I'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes
My Uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar
My waistline hold a four pound Beretta
I'll shoelace your face just to learn you better
My ox so sharp it cut through leather
My rap name Killer, my street name Skunk
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!
I switch my slang, spit from my mouth
I'm still all coast, my coast the South

Give it (Yeah)
Give it to you (To you)
And I do what it takes
To give it to you (Bust)
