35 ContributorsI Am I Be Lyrics
When, now?
I am Shortie, I be 4'11"
I am, I be, I am, I am, are you taping now?
I am Shortie
I am Patrick, I be the biggest shrimp collector in the world
Gotta do that again
I am Shortie, I be 4'11"
I am Jack and I be fire
I am Shortie
I am Shortie, I be 4'11"
I am mom and I be traveling
I am Shortie, I be 4'11"
I am Q-Tip, I be friction
I am Tasha, I be Black
I am Shortie, I be 4'11"
One more time
I am Shortie, I be 4'11"
I be Shortie and what?
I am Shortie, I be 4'11"
I be busy, I be happy, I be in love
I am Asia, I be talking to Posdnous
I am Shortie, I be 4'11"

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late
You might also like
Product of a North Carolina cat
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie
Who departed life just a little too soon
And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame
As we go a little somethin' like this
Look, ma, no protection, now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay
And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough, so the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay
I am an early bird but the feathers are black, so the apples that I catch are usually all worms
But it's a must to decipher one's queen from a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ
I cherish the twilight
I maximize, my soul is the right size
I watch for the power to run out on the moon
And that'll be sometime soon
Faker than a fist of kids speakin' that they're Black when they just niggas trying to be Greek
Or some tongues who lied and said, "We'll be natives to the end," nowadays we don't even speak
I guess we got our own life to live, or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?
Every now and then I step to the now, for now I see back then I might have acted like a fool
Now, I won't apologize for it, this is not a bunch of Bradys, but a bunch of black man's pride
Yet I can safely say, I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside
I've always walked the right side of the road, if I wasn't making song, I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs
But a man with a plan, and if I was a rug cleaner, bet you Pos'd have the cleanest rugs
I am

The Plug Two brand with the flavor in the flute, watch the sniffin', so a sack of shows in demand
I read the diction from the second page, I got the one-two gauge, baritone to the izm fan
Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink, so let me need you to my ems go
I push the infinite and carry it, my carrier's the three over one, so my pluggins already know
Lick shots with moo, catch the boo from a ghost in the heckling crowd if I give a foot
Jack Ville caught a spill when a spill came from my mouth
I brought a head down south
I don't check for the noose and the neck, so I never tell my ems that finesse is knocking at my door
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun and dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore
I bring the element H with the 2, so you owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade
It's just mind over matter and what matters is that the mind isn't guided by the punished shade
I keep the walking on the right side, but I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong
'Cause that's how he wants to be, no difference, see, I wanna be like the name of this song
I am
I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late

The deeds of a natural are seeds that are no longer planted, so the famine in the mind is strong
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane, sane enough to let you know from within this song
I stabilize many cableized viewers, so my occupation's known, but not why I occupy
And that is to bring the peace, not in the flower, but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am

I am Kim and I be chilling the hell out
I am Bob and I be really, really tired of doing this here, guys2Embed
