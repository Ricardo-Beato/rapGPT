Yo, a slow burn we are
Last long three-man act to wake up your thermostat
Blind through the property line
Creative minds crossover and back
Scribble with a knife to earn that slice of life
Cock back, aim, shot the name wherever the price is right
The pain earned is the pain learned, and heads talking like Byrne
Connect (to the same as it ever was)
Respect the land cause it never floods and well irrigated
Looking for my vanity, it's there, the mirror hate it
And stated, stop being an MC and give your verses more weight
By being just M-E, thoughts are oxidized when I spit em out
And my lungs prefer tastes, encrypted words laced to get them out home
With removal service to get kings out the throne
(More hands on) With hands upon the neck
Of a voice magnifier over decks
The sound is found at the youngs in the batch
Lovely how I let my mind float
You can catch me in the early morning
Find me up with no yawning
Haven't been asleep, I'm on cue
8 in the corner pocket from the booth all 24 hours like it was our debut
Life edited my etiquette
Dreams beyond your eons
You can't wait this out
Start blitz, starring it's that crew who never call the splits convey lines made from outer spines
So the nerve of us to be so damned crush
Grit like JDL and we sip from the grail
Where the current course connects, so we're not unsung
Just vets, this mission's undone
You might also like
We getting loot in this, you new to this
We true in this
Baby you already know who it is
We been doing this
We been doing this
Been true to this since Yoo-Hoos and tunafish
Catch flights, hit the stewardess
We been doing this
We been doing this

Yo, it's a honor and a pleasure
Rappers is not try to see me like a diamond tester
I'm on the low, I'm like a silent investor
Well dressed, my suit and vest is never polyester (never)
Keep a shottie on the dresser
My queen look like a young pepper
Up in her plump compress her
My tongue is forever under the weather, however
My heart was still lighter than a feather
Culturally, snort em like coca leaf
Them niggas suck more - no teeth
On the low though in my Polo tee
The show cost money but the promo's free
My pen collection is interesting
No steel, but still niggas will feel threatened
My genetics is comedic
Driven in lanes I was looking angelic
Psychedelic, if niggas like it I can sell it
But I don't fuck with that sweet shit, I'm diabetic
This is rapping at its peak
Your bird's steady yapping at the beat
Of a parakeet
You're not unique, you're no Kool Keith
Shit is more parrot-y (parody)
To get with the illa rhyme distributor
A verse might run you a year's salary
We getting loot in this, you new to this
We true in this
Baby you already know who it is
We been doing this
We been doing this
Been true to this since Yoo-Hoos and tunafish
Catch flights, hit the stewardess
We been doing this
We been doing this

Yo, put that bread on all fours The Catcher in the Rye
New York City lights look better in July
4th, no fireworks will dangle in the sky
Like right there, feeling the night air
Promoting the fair fight
Square dance, men at the faceoff
Crooked eye letters from Madoff apologizing
Long journeys walking cold hard facts
Once you turn up there, there's no turning back
From Rock Co.Kane Flows to flows that are crack
In the hemline, versus on the land muddied your man
The hard work you threw on the scale, damn
I'm Joe Pesci on the Dish, so messy on the disk
Puerto Rican mamis call me "flapi"
Leap a tall feeling in a single bound
Way over your head like my ex-girl talking bout mind sex
(Well you're a dickhead)
Two ticks away from aww shit
Cause I'm an old fart
Go campaign DAISY Age
Dave fresh like a pound of sage
Decorate the paramount figures
Watch the way they crown the stage
Sipped Crown but I was down in age
See the sailor took a sip, saw the whole ship drowned in grey
Classmates couldn't find a page
Had the answers written in my palm ever since promise paid
We getting loot in this, you new to this
We true in this
Baby you already know who it is
We been doing this
We been doing this
Been true to this since Yoo-Hoos and tunafish
Catch flights, hit the stewardess
We been doing this
We been doing this
L.I., nigga
L.I., baby
Pimp  Amityville
Yo, it's an honor and a pleasureEmbed
