Ayo
It's too many producers, haha
That's giving off these fraud beats, you know what I'm saying?
Your worst mistake is to try duplicate anything that Timbaland make, alright?
So, you gon' hear this beat one time and one time only
And I'm gon' just do a lil' something on it
Alright, check it

Bitches, I never wanna hang with bitches
Since I turned Missy, every bitch wanna meet me booty lickin'
My ass they kissin', but I feel like they way too picky
I used to know a guy name Ricky, oh really? Don't piss me off
And son, better let y'all know y'all lucky
'Cause if I come out buckin', the whole world better be duckin'
'Cause I roll with Puffy, no doubt, shit, turn it out, get ugly
No matter what you still love me, me wack? You buggin'
