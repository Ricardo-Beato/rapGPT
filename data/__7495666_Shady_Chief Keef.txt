These niggas be shady so evil been constantly
Got to be weighin' the sack (Ayy)
These niggas be handlin' no drugs
They cannot be actin' like twenty-four that
These niggas be shady so evil been constantly
Got to be weighin' the sack (Yurr)
These niggas be handlin' no drugs
They cannot be actin' like twenty-four that (Yeah)
These niggas be shady so evil been constantly
Got to be weighin' the sack (Ayy)
(Ayy) Constantly got to be weighin' the sack
These niggas be shady so еvil been constantly (Phew)
Got to be weighin' thе sack (Phew)
These niggas be shady so evil been
Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that

These niggas be shady so hit 'em, nigga
They lookin' for ya, go get 'em, nigga
You look me up, up in Wikipedia
Wet 'em up like, like Drizzle, Drizzle
Let that bitch pop, watch the pistol-fizz
These niggas shadier than a bitch
Pussy can't pass street pop quiz
Shoot off his nose, it's not a quiz
Who in that tank? It's a black lil' nigga
Shoot shit up, come clap a nigga
I don't know, you can't handshake
But you might get a lil' dap, lil' nigga
And the Glock saran, he gon' wrap a nigga
She don't like a nigga, she gon' tell a nigga
She the type to walk up and tap a nigga
And that bitch crazy, she might slap a nigga
Come at her house, she might trap the nigga
These people might never, never find the nigga
You don't want time, no crime, nigga
Special like crime on cameras nigga
You know I got a Tommy like Pamela
You know I got a Tommy like Pamela
You might also like
Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that
Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that

These niggas be shady so evil been constantly (Huh?)
Got to be weighin' the sack (Go, huh? Go, huh?)
Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that (Go, huh?)
Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that (Huh? Huh?)
These niggas be shady so evil been constantly (Ayy)

Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that (Yeah)
Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that (Bang)
Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that (Phew, bang, bang)
Cannot be actin' like twenty-four that (Phew)
