Alright, we gon' switch it up like this...

Uh, now, I'm off the hook, so none of y'all can debate it
Started making music, cause I never really relatedâ€”
To this bullshit, that they spit, claiming that they made it
Similar to a eight guard, cause I can't fade it
Use your logic, you could never evade it
I'm kinda like the Young Sinatra, mixed with Sammy Davis Jr
Already knowing they are, two of the best to ever to do it
Rhyming to improve and take rap
And move it in another direction, spread like infection
Better yet, lice, cause I'm always on their mind
I'm a breed of different kind, yes
I'm ahead of my time when it comes to the rhyme
You can catch me in the booth, from dusk, 'til the sun up
That Super Mario flow, I always get the one up
Yeah, we gun up, laser gotta help me run up
Not really, but it sounded tight, shut up
Fuck around, steal your bitch, just to get the nut up
Really, what up? With everybody looking for a deal
You can call me Indy-ana Jones and I'm headed for the throne
Going on a M.J. beat, leave me alone, this is music
Who are you to tell me how to use it?
Never confuse it, originality, I'll never lose it
Maybe I'm a little psycho, for hopping on the beat
But the logical part of me, telling me, you're feeling B
See? I'm a lyrical entity, blowing minds like Kennedy
With controversial lines, so everybody remember me
I'm repping Maryland, if you bite
I'll snap on you, like a Terrapin
Flyer than an airplane, I'm just fucking around
Switch it up with various styles, just to keep you around
