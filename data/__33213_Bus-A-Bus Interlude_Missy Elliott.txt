4 ContributorsBus-A-Bus Interlude Lyrics
Yes indeed, yes indeed out this motherfucker
Back with the right foot steppin' in first
And the left foot steppin' in after
I go by the divine attribute of Busta Bust Down Something
Otherwise known as Busta motherfuckin' Rhymes out this bitch
You know what I mean?
'Cause when I'm in the spot
I let a bitch start kissin' up on motherfuckers
Love the way that I be pissin up on motherfuckers
Motherfuckers need to chill, relax, what they need to do is listen up, motherfuckers
So as we begin to get you addicted to the shit that's so addictive
Make sure you got your peoples with you
You know, one of your peoples that stay sober
You know, to make sure you get home safely
'Cause we about to take it there, motherfuckers
