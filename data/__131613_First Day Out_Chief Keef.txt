65 ContributorsFirst Day Out Lyrics
Bang, skrr
You are now rocking with Frencizzle the French hitmaker
Sosa, what you on?
Shit

I'm startin' off my day with a blunt of Earth (Dope, dope)
Lookin' myself up, see how much I'm worth
I'm ridin' down the block in this silver Porsche (Skrr, skrr)
That bitch already know that I'ma flirt
I'm back off in the stu' working on some new
You get 8 bars for 10 (Bars), 12 for that times 2
50 for a show, 20 for a verse
As soon as I'm done I'm countin' like a nerd (Nerd)
My baby need some new and she get it first (KayKay)
I'ma be sober real soon so I need some herb
I hopped out of that 'Rari with that Louis bag
And if a nigga try me, foe'nem do his ass (Bang)
I'm countin' a million dollars in my mansion (Yeah)
Hoes everywhere, I got bitches dancin' (Thots)
Choppas in the closet, pounds in the den (Bang)
We got the 30's on us, meet that many men (Bang)
Couple M16, this ain't no force (Top)
All my niggas standing tall on my front porch
I got 3 cars up in my garage
Have my niggas in ya grass, bitch, camoflouge (Bang)
Sosa back, bitch, yeah, I'm back, bitch (Sosa, baby)
Did you miss me (Huh?), or you ain't care, bitch? (Huh?)
This that O shit (O), that 064 shit (064)
And FrontStreet, GBE, 3 double O shit (Double O)
My shit list, I'm on the Forbes list (Yeah)
Since I’m a rich nigga, I don’t need a rich bitch (Yeah)
I got a dumb wrist, it do dumb shit
I'm on that dumb shit, and we ain't frontin' shit (O'Block, bang)You might also like9Embed
