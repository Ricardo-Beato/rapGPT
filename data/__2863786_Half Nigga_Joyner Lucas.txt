13 ContributorsHalf Nigga Lyrics
Know what it's like to be half nigga
To be half nigga, to be half nigga
Yeah
Joyner
Joyner

Know what it's like to be half nigga, just a half nigga (yeah)
My white Mom fell in love with a black nigga (damn)
Just a black nigga
A white lady with a colored kid
I don't even understand what my color is
What my color is (what my color is)
Black, White, Brown, and some other shit
Homie say you ain't allowed with us
I don't even want you hanging out with us (nah)
And quit trying to act like you proud of us
If we were slaves back then, you'd be a house nigga
A house nigga (a house nigga)
Wow nigga, know what I hate the most
A bunch of cartoons with some racist quotes
And subliminal messages and racist jokes
Kinda funny how the money not ours (money not ours)
Yeah the money not ours
All the white motherfuckers got power (damn)
While the black motherfuckers got talent
Trying to get respect that'll never be valid (never be valid)
Never be valid
Even if you had level 3 clearance (yeah)
Even if you had Hillary's parents (yeah)
Even if you were a rap star (rap star)
Even if you had 10 cars and
Even if you had a Red Porsche and a 747 with 10 floors and the best whores
Even if you were a ball player, playing for the Clippers
Just imagine how you would feel if you were Doc Rivers
With a boss like the racist motherfucker Donald Sterling
I've been in and out of feelings, how sad is it (how sad is it shit)
Yeah how bad is it, when your boss got billions of cash and shit
And you stuck at the bottom you ain't half as rich
Fighting to be equal in the battle with
Another race in this land full of happiness
Another day trying to race to establish this
Another way, gotta wait for an activist to come say how we feel
Ain't that some shh.. (ain't that some shit) ain't that some shit
But meanwhile I got morals to stand up for
Can't cause I got a daughter to man up for
Gotta bite my tongue (gotta bite my tongue)
While the life is young if you a black entertainer it'd be nice
To run this shit, but you not shit till the fight is done
And that's just with the icing on the cake
If we didn't break, we'd be twice as strong (twice as strong)
But now it's twice as hard
To be a half nigga living in this life of darkness
All the black kids looking at me like I'm awkward
Cause I'm too light to be on one side of the streets
Now I play both parts, like hide and go seek
Malcolm X gave hope of getting out of the streets
And Rosa Parks was never getting out of her seat
I guess we here for life (here for life)
And I heard Mr. Sterling got banned for life, from the NBA
And He can sell the team
If that don't take away the heat from his self esteem
We in a helpless scene and a helpless time
With no help, trying to help decide, if we in hell or a jail
Can't yell or cry, can't scream or tell
But they can tell us lies nigga
You might also like
Know what it's like to be half nigga (a half nigga)
Just a half nigga
My white Mom fell in love with a black nigga(just a black nigga)
Just a black nigga
A white lady with a colored kid
I don't even understand what my color is
What my color is (what my color is)
Black, White, Brown, and some other shit
It's kinda funny how the money not ours (money not ours)
Yeah the money not ours
All the white motherfuckers got power (got power)
While the black motherfuckers got talent (got talent)
Trying to get respect that'll never be valid (never be valid)
Never be valid, just a half nigga(a half nigga)
Just a half nigga
(a half nigga)
(a half nigga)
(a half nigga)
(a half nigga)
(a half nigga)
(a half nigga)Embed
