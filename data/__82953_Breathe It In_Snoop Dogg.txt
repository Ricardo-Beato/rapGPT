6 ContributorsBreathe It In Lyrics
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Breathe it in, breathe it out

We smoke good good, you smoke sour
You got lights out, well we got power
Ask your girlfriend, she knows how I
Blew about a zip in my Eddie Bauer
I like fist fights, you need two Glocks
You rock bullshit, while we knock 2Pac
This that high five, yep that fire
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah and I'm gon' die high
Itchy ga ga, you got bush
We got Obama, and we blow kush
AK-47, not that train wreck
We blow bubble kush, while you smoke bullshit
Ask my nephews, up in the yay yay
If it ain't the Cali then it must the hay hay
This your highlight, so get your shit right
And this that real talk, so get that shit right

You might also like
Your kids and your mama, they say that they love me
Cause I am the big dog, and you just a puppy
I got big game, you got nada
You like white girls, so you sniff powder
Weigh that bag light, and play that flash light
This your last night, now get my cash right
I am King Kong, you just a baby cub
I got long dong, and you got baby nuts
Smoke with Snoop Dogg, I don't think so
You got outdoor, I like indo
I am legendary, you are temporary
You smoke stress for less, we smoke blueberry
You got the woo wop sack, so don't start that
Why you pop that, young nigga you ain't got that
If you need that, turn on your headlights
Cause I got that shit to get your head right
Now, smell the smiso, I got diesel
Spread the weed smur', I'm high as a beezurd'
Relax and kick back as D.O.D. did
Now hit that, lit that, and bring that shit back


She likes Lebron, he likes Kobe
Well I like Baron Davis, cause that's my homie
L.A. unified, add that up low
Not what you smoke, cause you smoke bunk dope
How many T signs, must I relate back
If you ain't got kush, then please don't say that
We get down here, your weed got brown hair
And that's the kind of weed that we don't smoke round here
See, you smoke red hair, we smoke that there
You got whack shit, and we got cat piss
We like swisher sweets, you like back woods
Your weed got seeds, and you think that's good?
Boy you so lost, I am so boss
I got Q.P.'s, to me that's no cost
D.O. double G, L.B.Cizzne'
I guess this will be the death of me
And if it do so, then let my lungs lay
Cause I'm in heaven blowing seven's of O.G
