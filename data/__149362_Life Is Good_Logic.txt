45 ContributorsLife Is Good Lyrics
Sinatra
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know that I got it, yeah, we got it over here
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it all here
Just me and my homies livin' life over here
Couple bad bitches down to ride, oh yeah
I know that I got it if I take my time
I know that I got it, everything will be fine
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it over here
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it, oh yeah

Tell me what you know about the come up
While you at the party I be workin' 'til the sun up, yeah
I just wanna live my life, and give you everything that I can give, alright, alright
Me and my homies live in Hollywood, but that don't mean we hollywood
And if I could reply to every fan
Hell yeah, you know I prolly would
Live life 'til I overdose
I said it once, had to say it dos
I remember livin' at Mary Jo's, now I'm livin' like pharaohs
I work like a slave, live like a king
'Cause in the end, I promise money ain't a thing
You might also like
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it over here
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it all here
Just me and my homies livin' life over here
Couple bad bitches down to ride, oh yeah
I know that I got it if I take my time
I know that I got it, everything will be fine
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it over here
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it, oh yeah

I just wanna do it right
I just wanna go tonight
Gettin' lost in the city lights
Gettin' lost in the pretty lies
Yeah, shout out to Maryland, shout out Chicago
Shout out beautiful women that follow where I go
'Cause I know I got no time for these fake hoes and these fake rhymes
We live it up in these great times
Always on my mind, this is real life
Okay, I guess this is what it feels like
Just me and my homies, do you realize?
This the type of shit I used to prophesize
Eyes on the real, though
All y'all probably duck down on the real low
I switched it up the day I got a deal, yo
But I'm bringin' that real flow
And of course a little bit of melody, guess I got the appeal, though
But don't ever think I'll be sacrificin' with the skill, though
I said I'm bringin' that real flow
I 'member comin' up real po'
Now let me bring it in real slow
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it over here
I know that I got it, yeah, we got it all here
Just me and my homies livin' life over here
Couple bad bitches down to ride, oh yeah
I know that I got it if I take my time
I know that I got it, everything will be fine
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it over here
Couldn't wait to get it, now we got it, oh yeah

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
