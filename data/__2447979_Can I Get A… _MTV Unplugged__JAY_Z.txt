6 ContributorsCan I Get Aâ€¦ (MTV Unplugged) Lyrics
I wanna go back 98
Maybe go back 96
Couple a hits
Help me out yo

Bounce with me with me with me
Can you bounce with me
Can you bounce with me
Left side can you bounce with me with me
Right side can you bounce with me
In the middle can you bounce with me
Help me out

Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse, if I was broke would you want me
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Jigga's kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a by the name of
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a working harder than nine to five
Then ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a player when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Can I get a (whoop whoop)
To all of my thugs who don't love those that get no dough
Can I get a (whoop Whoop)
To all of my ladies, uh, aha
Can I get a (whoop whoop)
To all of my players who don't love those that got no dough
Uh Uh
Now can you bounce with me
Can you bounce with me with me with me
Can you bounce with me
Bounce bounce bounceEmbed
