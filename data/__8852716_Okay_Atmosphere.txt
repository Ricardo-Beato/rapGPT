It'll be okay I think that needs to be established
For all of us that are easily distracted
Impatiently waiting for that American dream
Staring at the cracked screen of my anti-facts machine
Crash landed where the woke intersect with the exhausted
They asked if I'm depressed I don't doubt it
I was told it all began as a quest for some knowledge
Progress after you process the conflict
I'll be okay and if I got one wish
I'd probably waste it trying to make mysеlf an optimist
It's ironic because most of my thoughts are positivе
Just hop in the whip I promise not to drive off of the cliff
Happiness is my favorite physical feature
But I'm afraid I'll figure out that it's a mythical creature
I need to believe in the simulation that we're living in
Spent the whole stimulus check on some stimulants
I'll be okay just freestyle the answers
If you feel it put your hands up in front of surveillance cameras
Okay I don't take the buffet for granted
Make you understand it when you see me licking my plate
We gotta travel through space to keep the family safe
Check your connections can they can handle the bass
If they reflect your face it amplifies the existence of your significance
But only if you survive the collision
You might also likeIt'll be okay
Even if you're feeling like there ain't no way
You're still with us today
It's gonna be okay
Okay, alright
It'll be okay
Even if you're feeling like there ain't no way
You're still with us today
It's gonna be okay
Okay
I think I'm feeling alright
And I'll admit that sometimes I'm probably tongue-tied
Got me staring at the sun like my shoes ain't come untied
The clown face got replaced by this mountain of the
Midwest average from the mid-2000's
And being the best was never the intended destination
I just want appreciation for my presentation
Even if I was the only human left in population
This is dedicated to the dedication
You better love yourself today because tomorrow will be harder
Put your guard up don't let them penetrate your armor
Collect whatever crumbs you got and keep them in a bread box
You knew I was the one when I was sleeping in the wet spot
And baby if you had a dollar for all of your doubters
Maybe you could grow a salad and water the flowers
I know the zookeeper seen my leash and my collar
I'm in a tuxedo smoking weed in the shower
It'll be okay
Even if you're feeling like there ain't no way
You're still with us today
It's gonna be okay
Okay, alright
It'll be okay
Even if you're feeling like there ain't no way
You're still with us today
It's gonna be okay
Okay
I think I'm feeling alrightEmbed
