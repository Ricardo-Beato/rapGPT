Yeah, step into my rainforest
Step into my rainforest
Yeah only for the sexy people
Step into my rainforest, yeah yeah
Step into my rainforest, uh-huh
Let's see, I'm wet

Step into my rainforest
I'm tryin' to see who gon' make it make it rain hundreds, tornado pussy
Can you make it monsoon, honeymoon
Now we fuckin like a bride and groom
You want a taste of honey
I need to see the money
You wanna see the spread
You gotta spend some bread
Them racks in your pants
That'll make me dance
Now fill that with cash
Come on hop up on this ass

Make it rain trick

This kitty ain't for rowboats
Even titanics get washed away
He put his head between my legs
And he washed his face
Come and scuba dive
Inside my deep blue sea
Wanna ride this tidal wave?
You gotta pay a fee
Lick on the clit, I'll lick on the dick
Ride or die bitch, I sit on the shit
Can't get it wet, I spit on shit
I spit on spit on spit on the shit
Suck it up sit back on the dick
Doggystle back it up on the dick
Get a grip on them hips, bite on my lips
Take it out cum right on my tits
You want a taste of honey
I need to see the money
You wanna see the spread
You gotta spend some bread
Them racks in your pants
That'll make me dance
Now fill that with cash
Come on hop up on this ass
