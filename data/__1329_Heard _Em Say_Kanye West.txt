West—Mr. West—Mr. West
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah

And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars—I know it
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way
You might also like
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now
Ugh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, woo-woo
Oh, ooh, ooh
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea68Embed
