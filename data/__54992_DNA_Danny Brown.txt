58 ContributorsDNA Lyrics
It's in my DNA
'Cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my DNA
'Cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA
'Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA
'Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way

Wakin' up, droolin' on Versace pillowcases
I don't smoke an eighth a day, I might end up a mental patient
Terry cloth bathrobes, blunts and ashtrays
White wine in flute glass, early morning Saturdays
Food plates and Grape Ape, crepes and OJ
Bitches swimming topless in chlorine off morphine
Emails on iPads, don't answer when phone rings
Text message full, comin' down on four beans
Every night like a bachelor party in Sin City
Bitches sniffin' coke off each other titties with rolled fifties
Life I live like Charlie Sheen and Rick James
Goin' hard 'til ain't a dollar in my name
And this that Triple X shit nigga, how you feel?
Groupies like glam rock, poison logo pills
Sniffing molly off amps with blond-haired tramps
When I'm on my way to the stage, every night, I rage
You might also like
It's in my DNA
'Cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my DNA
'Cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA
'Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA
'Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way

Warhols all on the wall of the villa
Adderall poppin' got me jumpin' to the ceiling
Perceived as a villain, no sentiment in my sentence
For instance, in instants, they'll be calling forensics
If incidents occur, remember these ain't just words
Go from talkin' shit to organs preserved
You soft-serve rappers just hide behind your reverb
And even without effects, you'll end up dessert
I research and homework, make you dig your own dirt
On beats, buried alive, rattin' wiseguys
I'm with a Latin bitch, fat ass, well proportioned thighs
And love to see it cumming, so I squirt it in her eyes
I'm hoppin' out that new shit like narcs on Tuesday
Grill on it shiny like LL Cool J's
What's on my waist could make a nigga meet his doomsday
To describe your mixtape, the shit was like a toothache
It's in my DNA
'Cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my DNA
'Cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA
'Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA
'Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way7Embed
