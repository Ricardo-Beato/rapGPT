7 ContributorsCall Me What U Want Lyrics
Damn, Tadoe man, I'm serious man
Stay off that molly man, shit fuck you up
You already slow as shit
Let's get this guap with me

He do molly, God, he's slow
I got money, call me what you want
She a thottie, she give me throat
She hide the stash, she selling dope
I got a bag, you niggas broke
You niggas sad, it's not a joke
You got that cash, you getting poled
And I'm still banging, nigga, call me what you want

He get money? Yeah, bitch
But that don't mean you gon' get my shit, bitch
You got some molly? Yeah, bitch
I know you wanna get off the shits, bitch
That nigga a brick? He a bitch
Bitch you know I don't fuck with bricks, bitch
I send my hittas, he a snitch
And, bitch, you know I don't fuck with snitches, bitch
I'll kill any nigga, bitch
'Cause this shit not chocolate
Niggas act just like some bitches
Niggas acting like the opposites
I just bought another 50
'Cause niggas came in my house and shit
But you know Chief So ain't tripping
'Cause I'm getting guap and shit
Call me what you want, bitch
I'm still King Almighty
I was cooling smoking dope bitch
But you know I gotta have my gun
How you gon' call Sosa and you broke, bitch?
Waiting on the first of the month
You should've waited a lil' more, bitch
Now you broke once again
You might also like
He do molly, God, he's slow
I got money, call me what you want
She a thottie, she give me throat
She hide the stash, she selling dope
I got a bag, you niggas broke
You niggas sad, it's not a joke
You got that cash, you getting poled
And I'm still banging, nigga, call me what you wantEmbed
