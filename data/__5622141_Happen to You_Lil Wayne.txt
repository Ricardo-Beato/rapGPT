26 ContributorsHappen to You Lyrics
Don't ever think that it can't happen to you, you
You gotta stand on your own two, win or lose
And if it gets too hard to face the truth
You got to grow through what you go through, yeah

I need a bandage for the damage I've been through
I've been knocked down but I managed to improve
Only real competition is myself

She's stuck in my brain storm, trying not to get rained on
I put all these rings on and it look like I'm flame throwing
And I put all my chains on and it look like I snakecharm
I was down on my dick, everybody was hissing
Now I'm trying to keep them snakes up out my garden
Put your ear up to my safe, the money snoring
Carolina blue sorta look like Jordan's
Let's get high for Nipsey and pop a blue dolphin
And yes I gotta keep them snakes up out my garden
But keep that Mamba Mentality regardless
'Cause I know harder times are waiting for me in the future
All I can do is stay in my lane and put my gear in neutral

Don't ever think that it can't happen to you, to you
You gotta stand on your own two, win or lose
And if it gets too hard to face the truth
You got to grow through what you go through, yeah
You might also like
I need a bandage for the damage I've been through
I've been knocked down but I managed to improve
Only real competition is myself, myself
Yeah you need a bandage for the damage you've been through
You've been knocked down but you managed to improve
Only real competition is in you

I'm caught in a thunderstorm
I look up and it's fuckin' pouring
I'ma need me a lucky charm
I need it easy as Sunday morning
I keep me a firearm 'cause I always think I'm at harm
But it ain't no smokin' over here without ringing my fire alarm
On gang, on God, on moms
This life will break you down to crumbs
I was floating on the cloud, I jumped
And when I hit the ground I sunk
Yeah they thought I was down, I'm up
I was lost now I'm found, what's up
I came too far around to give up
When I was down on my dick
Everybody was missing, they thought I would miss them
But I got in that kitchen and cooked up this wisdom
I started a system
If you really love your niggas you'd never risk them, yeah
Don't ever think that it can't happen to you, yeah
You gotta stand on your own two, win or lose, yeah
And if it gets too hard to face the truth
You got to grow through what you go through, yeah

I need a bandage for the damage I've been through
I've been knocked down but I managed to improve
Only real competition is myself, myself
You need a bandage for the damage
I've been knocked down, knocked down but I manage yeah
Only real competition is myself
Only real competition is myself2Embed
