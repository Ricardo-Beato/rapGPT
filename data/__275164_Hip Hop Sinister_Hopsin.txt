60 ContributorsHip Hop Sinister Lyrics
I'm changing man
I thought I was supposed to be this hip hop savior
But I have turned into a sinister

Yeah, wack niggas prepare to die
You ain't got nowhere to hide
I'm knockin' at your fuckin' door
You scared 'cause you know Hell arrived
Niggas gon' get dealt with rhymes
It's just me, myself and I
I low-key run this rap shit
You don't know 'cause it ain't televised
This is war, gentleman (kill)
My flow is filled with more venom
Than George Zimmerman in his car chillin'
With a loaded .44 tucked into his drawers fidgetin'
And itchin' to find a brand new casket to store niggas in
Y'all just make me laugh and giggle
Call me out on tracks then bitch I'll pound on you
Like that vendin' machine that stole my pack of Skittles
Niggas thought the old me dissolved and I went soft
After my album Raw but nah bitch I evolved
I'm takin' over shit easily
I rarely do collaborations 'cause y'all ain't qualified to be in a league with me
Hop just let the beast unleashed
Someone get this freak a leash
I'm snapping on all you, leavin' every MC deceased
You might also like
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder

Motherfucker we makin' history
A million independently
So kiss my fucking ass
Left or right you get to pick the cheek
You don't ball you just pretend you do to make the chicks believe
But your label is fucking you like Ruthless Records did to me
Stop with the compliments, I've been locked in my momma's den
Plottin' when I will be droppin' this Hopsin apocalypse
Bombin' the competent
Rap goblins mobbin' the continent
Gotta be dominant
I'm surprised that God isn't vomiting
I'm wearin' a badge, tearin' your ass
Another vag, cuttin' through necks, 'til they barely attached
Me and this game are one of the same, like Jarren and crack
The darkness is arrived, so make a flare with a match
You got skill? Where is it at?
I haven't seen it, who dares to attack a genius?
You'll get managed I'll have you gag your penis
Until you throw up your own liver (nuts)
I don't give a (fuck), the flow ripper (what)
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder

Now if I stop being who I am, that would upset me
I'll never change for none of your wack-ass deadbeats
I struggled to change for J. Christ to accept me
I don't even change clothes, shit not even my bed sheets
When I step inside the booth and rhyme
Rappers commit suicide
And jump in front of a moving semi-truck
Like it was cool to die
Niggas is watered down
Fuck it it's time to scuba dive
Better get on your knees and pray to God and hope that you survive
Killin' rappers like I condone violence
I murder you and when your soul is floatin' to hell I ghostride it
You won't last living in this cold climate, so don't try it
I know I'm ill, well I don't need no pussies to co-sign it
Commercial niggas thinking they carry the torch
It's going to be very hilarious when I bury your corpse
So next time you spit a fucking rhyme that's too simple
I'll jump kick your ass through the glass of the booth window
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder21Embed
