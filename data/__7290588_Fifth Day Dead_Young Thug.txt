Yeah (Ooh, no)
Yeah (Ooh, no)
Yeah (Ooh, no)
Yeah, yeah (Ooh, no)
Tell me (Ooh, no)
Say (Ooh, no)
Yeah

Moncler coat 'cause I'm the coldest out
I had twenty thousand pints sealed in a drought
12 bend the corner, me and the dogs gettin' out
Got twenty-seven colors this Versace couch
I got it from Birdman out of his Miami spot
I told the bitch don't call me, she a Miami thot
They hate to see you rocking big ol' Pateks, rose gold
White diamonds on my wrist just like my main bitch toes
I cut the top off of the Benz, that winter was cold
I got a lot of thots, but got respect for my hoes
I got a lot of spots to recess for all my kids in the back
Playgrounds galore for teachers askin' why all of 'em brats

Got big baguettes sittin' on my neck
I throwed it to my dawgs, I told 'em fetch
Fuck over opps, they can't see shit like this
I fucked her hard, I put that bitch to bed
I called 'em up and told him what he said
He text me back five days and he was dead
I told him bring my skeletons out the shed
I been sippin' on Wock', this ain't no red

Passport shawty, I can take this bitch places
High heel Chanel, oh, she rockin' big aces
A pussy nigga wish that he could trade places
I told a nigga, "You must be kidding, I'm goin' Maison"
I called my watch stupid 'cause the time froze
One-fifty for my tooth and when I find hoes
My niggas smoke Biscotti, not the pine cone
My nigga Jimbo did a dime, now he back home
I be countin' money all night long
And to my dawgs who can't fall off no more
I used to walk down, buyin' out the store
Her body was natural, now she plastic, she a Barbie

Got big baguettes sittin' on my neck
I throwed it to my dawgs, I told 'em fetch
Fuck over opps, they can't see shit but this
I fucked her hard, I put that bitch to bed
I called 'em up and told him what he said
He text me back five days and he was dead
I told him bring my skeletons out the shed
I been sippin' on Wock', this ain't no red

Yeah (Ooh, no)
Yeah (Ooh, no)
Yeah (Ooh, no)
Yeah, yeah (Ooh, no)
Tell me (Ooh, no)
Say (Ooh, no)
Yeah, yeah3Embed
