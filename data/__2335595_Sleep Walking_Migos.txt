17 ContributorsSleep Walking Lyrics
Ayy, wake up nigga!
Fuckin' sleep walking and shit
It's 'bout time they free my brother Offset
Free Mango
Free John Wick
Streets on lock!

Sippin' codeine got me sleep walking
Hit the plug with the motherfuckin' re-rock
Don't speak to me nigga talkin' cheap talk
Got the plug pulling up on the speed boat
In the trap dunking bricks like the tomahawk
A hundred thousand dollar what the chain cost
Spent two hundred thousand just to chop the brain off
Chop the brain off
I'm a go ahead and chop the brain off
Chop the brain off
I'm a go ahead and chop the brain off
Forgiatos spinning on a drop top
I'm a go ahead and drop the top off
Drop the top off
I'm a go ahead and drop the top off

Dropping the top I do surgery
Porsche 911 emergency
Back seat Bentley like I posed to be
I'm rich and famous don't get close to me
Young nigga what you know pulling up in the room with a bad bitch looking like a coca cola
I go 0-100 with a Lamb motor
You a loco choco, migo gang, we going global
I'm an ignorant nigga drop the brain off the rain
Forty thousand for the Rollie and it plain jane
Two pistols on me nigga call me Max Payne
I'm a fool with the rock like LeBron James
Sippin' syrup in the 'Rari watch me swerve
I came along way from the curb
I'm flyer than an eagle and an old school bird
I need my money ASAP not talking Ferg
You might also like
Sippin' codeine got me sleep walking
Hit the plug with the motherfuckin' re-rock
Don't speak to me nigga talkin' cheap talk
Got the plug pulling up on the speed boat
In the trap dunking bricks like the tomahawk
A hundred thousand dollar what the chain cost
Spent two hundred thousand just to chop the brain off
Chop the brain off
I'm a go ahead and chop the brain off
Chop the brain off
I'm a go ahead and chop the brain off
Forgiatos spinning on a drop top
I'm a go ahead and drop the top off
Drop the top off
I'm a go ahead and drop the top off

I'm a go ahead and drop the top off
Pull up in the 'Rari with the sawed off
At the top nigga never gonna fall off
She be fuckin' and suckin' just for a shoutout
Migos in the arena I know it's sold out
You mouth open wide young nigga close your mouth
Pull up in convertible them niggas hurt my nigga Pistol P and this shit really hurt to me
Back then when a nigga kick doors and juug bags I ain't have a vacuum seal, nigga had a sandwich bag
Now I made it nigga having millions
Drop the top call it banana peeling
When I step out like a polar bear young nigga chillin'
And she knowin' Migos in the building
Pull up to the condo cause she feel me
Cut the top off the coupe like a pair of scissors
Sippin' codeine got me sleep walking
Hit the plug with the motherfuckin' re-rock
Don't speak to me nigga talkin' cheap talk
Got the plug pulling up on the speed boat
In the trap dunking bricks like the tomahawk
A hundred thousand dollar what the chain cost
Spent two hundred thousand just to chop the brain off
Chop the brain off
I'm a go ahead and chop the brain off
Chop the brain off
I'm a go ahead and chop the brain off
Forgiatos spinning on a drop top
I'm a go ahead and drop the top off
Drop the top off
I'm a go ahead and drop the top off2Embed
