45 ContributorsIt’z Crackin’ Lyrics
All or nothing (Bang)
I was chillin', smokin' loud
She like, "Ain't you Chief Keef?
Yeah, the famous Chief Keef" (Bang)
Sosa, O'Block
Bang, bang
Bang-bang
Bang, bang
GBE, OTF

I was chillin', smokin' loud
She like, "Ain't you Chief Keef?
Yeah, the famous Chief Keef"
And now she wanna freak me
But she already know, she gotta do the team (The team)
Yeah, yeah, the... (The team) the team
Yeah, yeah, the... (The team) the team
I'm all about my green
Makin' stupid horror scenes
Reese Money, where that 30?
.50 cal go with that beam
I got a lotta hitters, nigga, you not anything
Run a bitch that you love and leave her with a dream
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
Get off the porch, no lackin'
Ride on you, slide the doors back
Like applause, nigga, we clappin'
We take what you taxin'
Split it even like magic
Fredo, he in the cut
Make it very scary like Freddy
You might also like
You sneak dissin', what's hannin'?
Them guns split you, it's crackin'
2-4, no stackin'
Ridin' 'round with them ratchets
You want it? I got it
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
OTF in the party
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
Bitch nigga, it's crackin' (Bang)
Bitch nigga, it's crackin' (Bang-bang)
You ain't 'bout that action
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
When them bullets flyin' at ya
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'

It's crackin', it's crackin'
For Fredo, I'm crackin'
For Reese Money, I'm crackin'
Keep ya eyes open, no lackin'
Have 600 come clap ya
Bullets come tackle
Bullets bouncin' like rabbits
Like I said, nigga, it's crackin'
One in the head, clip in my pocket
And you know it's a thirty
Some pop off of that clip
And then click-clack, then Bernie
Goes the MAC, nigga, hollows fat, nigga
Rippin' through Godzilla's back, nigga
Have ya bitch suck my dick, nigga
Let her hit that loud pack, nigga
Big E, nigga, he gon' let it blow
Edogg gon' let it blow
When shit get so technical, we erase niggas like schedules
O'Block just to let you know
Keta World just to let you know
R.I.P. to Lil Moe, that's why if I die, I got's to go, but
You sneak dissin', what's hannin'?
Them guns split you, it's crackin'
2-4, no stackin'
Ridin' 'round with them ratchets
You want it? I got it
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
OTF in the party
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
Bitch nigga, it's crackin' (Bang)
Bitch nigga, it's crackin' (Bang-bang)
You ain't 'bout that action
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'
When them bullets flyin' at ya
Bitch nigga, it's crackin'Embed
