13 ContributorsLocked in Spofford Lyrics
They got me locked in Spofford, the lil' juvenile criminal
Two kids approach to put blades to my throat
They like my coat and ask me what I'm gonna do for that
Give it up? Huh, you don't believe that
So I threw on my hood, pulled out the banger
Swung it at the kids that put me in danger
They put away them blades and said, "Why it gotta be like that?"
'Cause you get a little ox and don't know how to act
Yeah, now I got props and I'm runnin' shit
And when it comes to phone time, you don't get none of it
So sit back and just chill
Before you make a lil' nigga have to get ill
Only got a month left, so I gotta be on my best
But yet and still herb niggas wanna put me to the test
So I wild with a blade and a Kool-Aid smile
Let the juvenile catch wreck for a sec
Damn, I wish I could put my hands on a
Nice-ass Tec and blow a nigga to Babylon
But if you don't got a knuckle game, that's a damn shame
Nigga I feel for, they got you washin' drawers
But I refuse, 'cause I got nothin' to lose
Props I gotta earn, plus I gotta pay my dues
So in the meantime, I got a ox in my pocket
They got me locked in Spofford
You might also like
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down

To Spofford and JV's worse than Rikers
Adolescents that ball hardcore
With the criminal-minded juveniles
The real lil' niggas step out of the piles
And I'm not takin' no shorts while I'm up here
Spit 'em up, gem stars, but ain't no scars here
Protective custody's got mines
No type of help, I'm in here for self
And so I got locked up on a one to two
On the bus catchin' beef with mad crews
Run my shoes, fuck that, I'm goin' out, kid
But not too buck wild, 'cause I gotta finish my bid
Four times for my peoples up from the 'Bridge
Here it takes a lot of heart to live
Behind bars, child correction
Trapped in the buck wild dorm E section
They got me smokin' the death sticks
Niggas got me fightin' for my life 'cause shit is real
Shorty kill a man, got locked down
You want a buck sixty? You betta, betta back down
On the streets a hood, but in here
You're up to no damn good, nigga, I wish you would
Try to take mines and try to shank mines
Shorty corrupt, there's no stoppin' me, even in jail, I tear shit up
And when I get out, it's gonna get worse
The devil in the flesh, I'm puttin' hammers on a hearse
So while I'm in here, don't forget my name
Ain't shit changed, I'm still the motherfuckin' same
I didn't bitch up when I got here
Cell rep, I got shit locked here
One more month I'm goin' Uptown
To the big pen and I'ma still win
'Cause jail is my life and I like it here
Ain't no rules, you can do what you like in here
Jailhouse blues, I miss the ghetto
C.O.s think they're five-Os with no heat
So what am I to do when they step
Put 'em in check, and throw hands with a redneck
And now I got a little crew to watch my back
Lunchtime comes, huh, you ain't gettin' none of that
'Cause I got shit sewn up real tight
Not one bit of fright, while I'm locked in Spofford
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down2Embed
