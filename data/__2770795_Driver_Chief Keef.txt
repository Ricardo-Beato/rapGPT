25 ContributorsDriver Lyrics
Otto
Ayy man, look, God dammit, man (Let's get it!)
Ayy man (Catch up)
You know I'm a, I'm a trend setter (Catch up)
This is what I do, you know (Bang)
Niggas take the shit I do (Ftftft)
It could be anything, God dammit (Beep, beep)
You know what I'm saying, take what I do
You know what I'm saying (Turn the music up for me, Chris), they put it in themselves
And they run with it, God dammit (Sosa)
You know? Ok, so look (Bang, bang)
Like a stolen gun you know? (Bang)
When they see the serial number, right (Sosa baby, GBE baby)
And they come back to a nigga (Sosa on the beat)
That be me, you know (Bang)

I started in the basement (Yeah), now I'm in a mansion (Bang)
I took Ben Franklin (Yeah), and held him for ransom (Beep)
I lived with my granny (Yeah), now I got ten bedrooms (Skrrt, skrrt)
I rolled in a putt putt (Yeah), now my car got so much leg room (Skrrt, skrrt)
I turned nothing into something, I am a MacGyver (Ftftft, beep)
And the way I do this shit, I am not a tryer
You say you got that Wockhardt, I might be your buyer
Nigga think he going crazy, I might be your driver (Skrrt, skrrt, bang)
You might also like
You try shit, I buy shit
Get to blicking, It's lightning
No thirty, It's Mike Vic
That's fifty-two shots in this hundred
'Cause if you fill it up, it cannot breath
This cash in my pocket cannot leave
Get seasoned and fall just like leaves
Girl, your nigga wanna ball just like me
My whole fucking body numb, larocaine
I'm a motherfucking boss, you're a lame
How I bowl through these niggas, you're a lane
Knock your neck down your chest, now you're a chain

I started in the basement (Yeah), now I'm in a mansion (Bang)
I took Ben Franklin (Yeah), and held him for ransom (Beep)
I lived with my granny (Yeah), now I got ten bedrooms (Skrrt, skrrt)
I rolled in a putt putt (Yeah), now my car got so much leg room (Skrrt, skrrt)
I turned nothing into something, I am a MacGyver (Ftftft, beep)
And the way I do this shit, I am not a tryer
You say you got that Wockhardt, I might be your buyer
Nigga think he going crazy, I might be your driver (Skrrt, skrrt, bang)

I'm going so crazy they should put me in a psych ward
She eat me in my Louis shorts, she bite shorts
The weed make me project, there's science in the weed
Let a nigga try me, he be dying with the trees
You would think I'm flying on this Glo rug, Aladdin
Treat my life like Orlando, it's magic
Play this shit up in the club, it's tragic
You ain't getting money, I can see it, no statics
Up to the top, I climb and climb
No cash for me to see, then I'm going blind
I'm gliding like a GLOverboard, I don't need no wheels
I don't think its purple rain if I don't see the seal from the start
I started in the basement (Yeah), now I'm in a mansion (Bang)
I took Ben Franklin (Yeah), and held him for ransom (Beep)
I lived with my granny (Yeah), now I got ten bedrooms (Skrrt, skrrt)
I rolled in a putt putt (Yeah), now my car got so much leg room (Skrrt, skrrt)
I turned nothing into something, I am a MacGyver (Ftftft, beep)
And the way I do this shit, I am not a tryer
You say you got that Wockhardt, I might be your buyer
Nigga think he going crazy, I might be your driver (Skrrt, skrrt, bang)

My whole fucking body numb, larocaine
I'm a motherfucking boss, you're a lame
How I ball through these niggas, you're a lame
Knock your neck down your chest, now you're a chain
BangEmbed
