Comin' down flexin' in a Transformer
I can take your bitch from ya then transform her
I'm high as hell, I just popped a Transform
Freeband Gang Nigga, We some Transformers
Transform (transform), Transform (transform), Dirty fork shawty I'm a transform her
Transform (transform), Transform (transform), Count a bunch of money then I transform

My cook up game crazy, my hustle game amazin'
140 Days, dawg we trappin out the Days Inn
Im sleepin' wit da woolie, I'm gettin' all my days in
Paranoid servin' junkies still gettin' my plays in
Drankin' out the seal, then I'm on a pill
Diamonds on my watch, Diamonds in my ear
"Forge" on the rims, European grills
Mastermind the booth, then I made a Mill
Baby u da truth, body of a goddess
Head game universal, did you go to Howard?
Marshmallow seats, paint yours sour
Freeband Gang, yeah the world ours
Working hard the iPad, Gucci is on my eyelids
Transform a dough, open up, look what I did
Perky Leaf ahmm, then I flex the muscle
Shinin' on the haters, shittin' on the bustas
Then I rent the booth, Batman coop
Ain't trippin off a bitch, bitch comin' by da group
Astronaut Status, Rock'n'Roll status
My attitude stanky, I'm on another planet

Comin down flexin' in a Transformer
I can take your bitch from ya then transform her
I'm high as hell, I just popped a Transform
Freeband Gang Nigga, We some Transformers
Transform (transform), Transform (transform), Dirty fork shawty I'm a transfrom her
Transform (transform), Transform (transform), Count a bunch of money then I transform

Brick on my wrist, I made a coup to a trick
I took that ho from that nigga, and I made her my bitch
Gettin' lyrical signs, when I rock it I'm buyin'
Go rock custom made Pluto gear, can't even find
I turn the club to a zoo, I flip my money Kung-Fu
I comin' down with the flu, I turn one into two
I made a FOE to a team, when it bought my a Benz
I'm a A1-Nigga, all we do is a trance
Going back to the future, right to J.Fox, Nigga
I put Kush in my lungs, had that "lean" on my level (Codeine)
That bitch came to me, and he had to go get her
And we workin' with Either, that's that Nas and Jigga

Comin down flexin' in a Transformer
I can take your bitch from ya then transform her
I'm high as hell, I just popped a Transform
Freeband Gang Nigga, We some Transformers
Transform (transform), Transform (transform), Dirty fork shawty I'm a transfrom her
Transform (transform), Transform (transform), Count a bunch of money then I transform2Embed
