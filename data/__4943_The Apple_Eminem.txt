103 ContributorsThe Apple Lyrics
I'm a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one who's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now, you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

Ha-ha! (Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha...)
Alright, look
I'ma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out

You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain, people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove
I was even worth bein' in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination? (Ha)
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who balks
I'm in the booth starin' back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal
You might also like
Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said, "Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree"

Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell out of the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like five/six
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri?
'Cause those were my best friends until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a switch and seventy-some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why a part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way, that bitch is one of my relatives
Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said, "Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree"

You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface, it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Ca$his, let's hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on

Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said, "Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree"
(Ha, ha)
Yeah, and I'm the crazy one, right?
Whatever! Then let me be the crazy one!
Balalalalalalalalalala (Aha-ha-ha)
Cuckoo (Cuckoo), cuckoo (Cuckoo), tweet! (Tweet!)
