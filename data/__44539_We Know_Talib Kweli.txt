14 ContributorsWe Know Lyrics
Hey y'all
That feel good, right? (Mmm)
Yeah, ok, uhh
Know what that make me talk about? (Love, love, love...)
Yeah, that's what the world need, ha
Yo, that's what your girl need (Ooh yeah)
Right, we gon' put it down like this
Tell you about myself

My name is Kweli, and I love to spit it, homie
I rap about lovin' life, ladies get to know me
If you feelin' lonely, I could be your one and only
I put it out in the world, so people show me (Love)
Yeah, I always get it back
This ain't no pimp game here, that's a different track (Yeah)
We talkin' this and that, we need to get with this
I keep it realer than most, this is our business

What we gotta do to make them see we got a good thing going on?
Want to tell the world if they don't know that what we have is real
Want to shout it from the mountains, baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know
You might also like
Yeah, yo, hey baby, look like you need a break tonight
Let me make it right, baby, won't you stay the night?
I got a lot of lovers, you know you my favorite, right?
Hey my lady, what we gon' make tonight? (Our love)
That's the dream, but I never sleep
Across a crowded room, our eyes forever meet
Filled up with doubt and gloom, 'cause we could never be
That's why I got to go, you my impossible love
You the horizon I can see but never ride off into
I write my lyrics to you, you the perfect instrumental
I sound better than the cat who rappin' to you now
That's between me and you, what happened to us now? (Love, love, love...)
Got you hopin' for the glorious waitin' for that victorious feelin' wanted by all of us
Kneelin' and prayin' that the lord in us will help us love ourselves
So much that the confidence attracted someone else

What we gotta do to make them see we got a good thing going on?
Want to tell the world if they don't know that what we have is real
Want to shout it from the mountains, baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

Yo, rockin' Los Angeles, House of Blues on Sunset
Performin' like a orgasm, my girl ain't even cum yet
Seen her by the side of the stage givin' me energy
Potentially wife material connectin' mentally
I felt like heaven sent for me, you're meant for me
The doubters and the haters had to acknowledge eventually
You was a non-believer too if memory serves
And now hardly give shit, tryin' to play your boy for the herb
The harder that I run to you, the farther you become
It's like my heart was part of some movie that hadn't yet begun
This woman moves me and I'm a mountain of a man
You pull me in like the waves do the grain of sand (Love, love, love...)
Yeah, I love the way you bring it to me
I wrote a song for you, I'd love to hear you to sing it for me
And let the melody carry me through the jealousy
And we can cruise like Tom and Penelope
What we gotta do to make them see we got a good thing going on?
Want to tell the world if they don't know that what we have is real
Want to shout it from the mountains, baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know
What we gotta do to make them see we got a good thing going on?
Want to tell the world if they don't know that what we have is real
Want to shout it from the mountains, baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we knowEmbed
