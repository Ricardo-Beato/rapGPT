I came prepared bitch
Tell yo dogz don't panic
Get up, sit up, we up 'til we lit up
Seven figures, eight, nine ziggas
That's four hittas, nig' its time, nigga
When you love body and niggas is in a hate crime
It's money on my mind
And after that Ima make mine
Fuck what you heard or call it
Crunch or break
Runnin' bags to the bags
As long as honey don't waste mines
Grown ass men be the saddest groupies
Sad ass bitches with the saddest pussy
Uh, open casket cuz she sits
Oh her tits sits on a casket, pussy
Oooohhh...you like this sexy body
So $-$ cash and a molly
They wanna see me give revenge
To some industry friends that done lied to my face
Bengazi, put a nigga in his place like a ride home
And I know where he at on my iPhone
Got a ounce and a tree, is my zone
Queen ABV on my throne
I could de-throne about three kings
Off heat I keep in my thumb
Can't fuck with me, I was made the queen
Mad black and free
I'm such a trap
You might also like
Cool nigga sit, trynna get a hot bitch
Wanna find a ride or die
I could ride dick
Oh you the hot kid?
You got your cock licked
Now you walk around town like you the hot shit
Bitch pressed, ma nigga check on so's
Saw yo man check me out
Control yo ho
Ho ass nigga just play yo role
Lay yo ass nigga, can't take control
Alpha female, use my control
How you gettin' to the top with no climbin' tho
How you screamin' from the world, can't find a ho

Warning!
The following sound may damage your speakers

Get back, way back, can you please back the fuck off
Read sign, 'fore cross the line says niggas gotta trance off
Beware, she wears, send 'em a beach, yea, each, yea
I'm a star league yea, hell yeah, in my own league, be scared
Uh, Warning!
Warning!

You know I've seen it before
These niggas gay on low
They gay on the low, gay, gay, gay
Gay on the low
Tell a nigga don't get too close
This pussy is too visceral
Ay papi, don't get too close
Tell a nigga don't get too close
Pussy is too visceral
Evidently this sweetest choach
Boom, boom, boom to the boom-boom room
Make a move to the boom boom room
Do you, in my dungeon, doom
Let me show you what my dungeon do
Ah, Hide the country cooch

Pleased to meet you a bump head too

Uh, uh, I ain't no prostitute
