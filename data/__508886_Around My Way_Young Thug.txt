14 ContributorsAround My Way Lyrics
Big old titties, my favorite
Put a big B on your head like you a raven
Never ever get you too tired, we’re not laces
And you know a young nigga more streeter than a pavement
Bitches just pay me that pussy, bitches just want have my children
Bitches know I’m just not with it, I’m gonn' watch her while she dishing
You know I’m not with the Girl Scouts
But I’m just smoking on cookies
Tripping cause you brought your girl out
I'm gonn' touch her when you ain’t looking
She like Mitsubishi, with the motherfucking secrets
Fuck her every weekend, all four pockets, just Monique'n
Tell me baby mommy, 20k thown at Onyx
She want some my money, so you know I’m pulling the tommy

Woah there, just stare
Can’t move, wheelchair
Woah yeah, got pocket full of them faces
Rolling just like a rolly polly, ole
You know you gonn' get it round my way
Gone fuck around, you gone fuck around
You gone get it round my way-ay,-ay
Gone fuck around, you gone fuck around
You gone get it round my way

You ain’t never took those trips in the rental back and forth
Up and down the interstate, trying to get it
Surrounded by young rich niggas, call us gorillas
Untouchable, we walk right in the club with them pistols
Turn a mug into a mushroom, DK get another sprite
Run up on 'em close range, that bezel another life
These niggas don’t want no problems, we solve 'em with 15 carbons
They gone think it’s a madness the way we marching
And we keep it on us, ain’t no way you robbing
Any questions come my way, man we got to solve em
Keep one in the hand, so ain’t no cocking
P-R-O-B-L-E-M, they don’t want no problems

Woah there, just stare
Can’t move, wheelchair
Woah yeah, got pocket full of them faces
Rolling just like a rolly polly, ole
You know you gonn' get it round my way
Gone fuck around, you gone fuck around
You gone get it round my way-ay,-ay
Gone fuck around, you gone fuck around
You gone get it round my way3Embed
