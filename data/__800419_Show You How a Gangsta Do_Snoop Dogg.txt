9 ContributorsShow You How a Gangsta Do LyricsGangsta, gangsta, gangsta
G'd up baby like the big drum beater
Blue cacky suit with the combo sneakers
Braze to the side, hope no ...
Dancing with a freak, she got her ass on my peter
Hennesey, so I pour another meter
Roll with me baby I promise you'll kick your feet up
Help your seats up, what you know you need it
Nigga up ... to flex and ...
Cop you like a glass from the bartender
I got a lot of love for you, tell me where to send her
Do you remember the last time you made love
Was the player ... a thug
It really ain't my bindess yo, I really wanna be up in this hoe
Damn, the music is loud in here
Come close, let me whisper a lil something in your ear, come here
I got something to say to you, the way you move
It's like chronical...
And if you play it smooth I'll show you how a gangsta do
Fill it in the grain blue, staying truth
My Cadillac...
Stacking up the revenue, and if you ready Boo
I'll show you how a gangsta do
Yeah, it's the gangsta boogie, the gangsta hoodie
You wonder how gangsta coodie
Baby baby, give me the goodies
In a white man's world, you give me the woodie
Cute face with a big old booty, big old titties
I meant to say tickle bitties
Pardon me, I be gripping to spitting... and buy some time
To get you a radical, cause I think me and you both are compatible
... romantical, dramatical, I've been through a lot
My life's radical
I need you and I gotta know
Yep, yep cause this is the way you gotta go
A nigga been capping at you, rapping at you
I wanna invite you to the cabin actor
I got something to say to you, the way you move
It's like chronical...
And if you play it smooth I'll show you how a gangsta do
Fill it in the grain blue, staying truth
My Cadillac...
Stacking up the revenue, and if you ready Boo
I'll show you how a gangsta do
You can walk on the left on me
Baby girl you know you bring out the best of me
I don't know, just might be destiny
But I'm haste to see how the rest will be
Love has a recipe, and this is just a test for me
To see it... you're sweeter than sweet ...you're just like juicy fruit
Lady you looking like a tasty pizza, candy
Let me get you in the mood, and get gangsta in the room
And we can stay a while and make sure you understand me
Stop playing girl, show me some love, that's what's up
Let me holler at you
I got something to say to you, the way you move
It's like chronical...
And if you play it smooth I'll show you how a gangsta do
Fill it in the grain blue, staying truth
My Cadillac...
Stacking up the revenue, and if you ready Boo
I'll show you how a gangsta do X 2You might also likeEmbed
