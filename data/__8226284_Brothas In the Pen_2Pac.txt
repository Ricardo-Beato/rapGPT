4 ContributorsBrothas In the Pen Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in

Let em loose
Let em loose
Like Bruce, we need a new plan
Swoop down on Uncle Sam
Now here we go again
Blacks in the back with the  on there back
Most are dying from crack or catchin' bullets with a 
Hit the racks in the jailhouse  on the get out
Get out, 'cause I'm out, but out of my moms
Every man that's in my family, know you understand me
My homeboy too, they can't fade you (Haha yeeah)
Me myself, well I'm livin' like "X"
'Cause sometime soon I feel I might be next
Jail is just like sex, everybody's got the  it for themself
And the ones with the wealth need to sit on my shelf
See what I see when we're out on the streets daily
Need a little meat, potatoes, and gravy
Game don't stop, cops get popped
Cops pop back, kids'll catch it or not
So
You might also like
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in

For my brothas in the pen
Uh,  ain't nothin' changed
Still strugglin', hustlin', trynna stay ahead of the game
It's all about the money, give a hell about the fame
It's a shame, how mean the media can be to yah man
I'll see you in about June
Have a party, bunch of grooves, with a honey dip or two
You've been gone for a long time (ahh)
Reminiscin' about old times, 
I might see you sooner than I expected
My PO said, ""
Ten years, he straight bust my bubble
I gotta calm down an stay outta trouble
Keep gettin' stronger
And no longer are they gonna hold us down
How crazy things will be when you get outta lockdown
Big up, big up to my jailhouse crew
This ones for you
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in

Grownin' up in the inner city
Booze is a common as a pair of tennis shoes
And the  a brotha looses
Wicked chooses your bruises and all ya'll gotta pay your dues
You a fool if you suin'
Young guns gettin' locked up quicker
Send 'em to the pen, now he's back again sickah
Wonder why the jail pull a black like me
Trapped like me, so they snap like me
Straight soldier I told yah
Never fed the ghetto kids, so now they hungry when they older
Everybody wants to know why my soul turned cold
'Cause a young brotha never got the chance to grow
From day one it's an all out struggle
Mind over muscle, brotha hustle 'til you 
Fling your middle finger to the cops if you must
Some you can trust, but most of 'em bust
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in
This is for my brothas in the pen'
I see you when I get out
If not when I get in

All my brothers out Queens in the house
Mutulu Shakur in the house, huh
The struggle goes on
This is to my brothers in the pen'
Uh huh my brother in the pen' now
Huh yeah, huh yeah
My brothas in the pen now
Uh yeah, uh yeah
Wicked in the house man
Uh yeah, my brothas in the pen'
Uh yeah, my brothas in the pen'
 and you don't know
My brothas in the pen'
 and you don't know
What, my brothas in the pen'Embed
