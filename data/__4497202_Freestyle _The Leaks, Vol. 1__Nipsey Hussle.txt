2 ContributorsFreestyle (The Leaks, Vol. 1) Lyrics
Yeah, fuck you
Fuck you, too
Fuck you, bitch
Fuck you, motherfucker
You ain't shit anyway, fuck you
You ain’t shit, you fat motherfucker
Yeah, whatever whatever
Whatever
You wasn't sayin' that when you was suckin’ my dick
You wasn't sayin that when you was eatin' my pussy
You nasty bitch
You a nasty motherfucker
Check it, uhh

Bust it, look
Nip Hussle, dope flow like yayo
I'm a boss, nothin' move 'less I say so
I'm a business, you a nigga on a payroll
Here come recession, there go your J-O
B, but we fly high
On more chrome than ever every time I ride by
MACs and Berettas tell you niggas no lie
From a hood so hot, it's heat waves in the sky
Remember, every day was like the Fourth of July
At war, so you had to keep your pistol in your ride
Lean low, kush smoke in the sky
Watchin’ out for blue cars driven by white guys
Now it’s like, white clouds with blue skies
Dumpin' out the blunt through the roof of my ride
European grille with the letters inside
Ain’t a nigga this fly comin' out the WestsideYou might also likeEmbed
