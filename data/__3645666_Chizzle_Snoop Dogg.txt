4 ContributorsChizzle Lyrics
Heavenly Father
Give power to me
Over temptation
In my hour of need
Say I'm not forsaken
Shower over me
All of Your patience
My stone ain't ready

Been a sinner for a while now
All of Your forgiveness
I might not deserve it
Sort of known to wild out
Okay to let your flaws show
Nobody is perfect
Hard for me to bow down
I was taught to stand up to anybody, anywhere, for anything
My hood, holy ground
Street war for fun
Taught to walk through hellfire with the kerosene
So quick to turn it up a notch
Low profiles, spinning, burnin up the lot
Always got that new thing turning up ya block
Always drive-by shooting, hard to make it stop
Pray for me
I'm something like a work in progress
Somebody already know
Pray for me
We already knew I needed someone to save my soul
You might also like
Let Him chisel away away away
Let Him chisel away away away
Let him chisel away away away
Please believe
He's workin on me
He's workin on me
Jesus

Heaven Father, let me lead by example
Let me be Your servant
Give you the true word that's spoken
Have ya heard it?
Have ya noticed?
Don't be deceived
By temptation of man
Realize, understand
That it's not your plan
That it's only God's plan (say what?!)
Do you really understand?
Open ya hands
Close em, praise Him
For all salvation
Give You the praisin'
Welcome to the party
So glad that you made it
My wrongs, my rights
I put em in yo faith
Just love, no hate
Try to keep us all straight
Till we see that day
See
Life is how you make it
Reject it, or you take it
Be real, or you fake it
Mistake and be patient
I'm tellin' you now
Things gettin real in the situation, boy
Don't fake it
24/7 tryna get in heaven
But ya attitude and ya mind state
Don't bite more than you can chew, homeboy
Don't try to eat the whole plate

Let Him chisel away away away
Let Him chisel away away away
Let him chisel away away away
Please believe
He's workin on me
Keep workin on me
JesusEmbed
