56 ContributorsJust Like You Lyrics
I don't wanna be nothin' like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be just like you
Look, I don't wanna be no fuck nigga
I don't wanna sell drugs, nigga
I don't ever wanna fuck mad hoes
And then claim I can't find love with 'em
I don't wanna be no super thug
I don't ever wanna get tripped up
I don't wanna get drunk and high
And spend all my time in the strip club
Look, I don't wanna ever go to jail and shit
Serve time and get bail and shit
Be a bum and start stealing shit
Fuck around and die and go to hell and shit
Yo, I don't wanna be jobless
And I don't wanna be heartless
Run around, tryna start shit
Pickin' fights, thinkin' I'm hot shit
Yeah, I don't wanna become vengeful
And I ain't into what you're into
Pray to God I don't run into
Someone just like you, my one issue
Hope one day, that shit does hit you
'Cause you so goddamn judgemental
And I don't wanna... look...
You might also like
I don't wanna be nothin' like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be caught just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be nothin' like you

Uh, I don't wanna be hopeless
A pretty girl with no focus
A single mom with like four kids
Never had much, never owned shit
And no school and no diplomas
Dropped out and don't know shit
Steady sticking my nose in on your business
Spreading rumors, uh
I don't wanna be chasing guys
Half ratchet, half sanctified
Giving all your friends lame advice
Always going out, can't stay inside, yeah
I don't wanna become trite
Content with my fucked up life
Little attitude, actin' uptight
Never had a clue, but I love fights
No, I don't wanna smoke cancer sticks
Going out every chance I get
I love the truth but can't handle it
Tryna cover bruises with bandages
But I hope one day, that shit does hit you
Cause you so damn judgemental
And I don't want...
I don't wanna be nothin' like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be caught just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be nothin' like you

I need someone to look up to
A role model I can run to
When I feel lost and I'm confused
And I'm out of touch with my young roots
I need confidence so that I can get
And I love you and your common sense
'Cause lately, I've been tryna live this thug life
And I'm not convinced
Look, I love how you handle your own
Glad you are the king to your own castle
You handle life when it's thrown at you
Never curl up, never faux fragile
I need you to be here, regardless
Teach me how to be there for my kids
Show me how to be fearless often
I need real guidance, I ain't scared of options
Because of you, I've got a clearer conscience
Because of you, I'm not scared of monsters
Because of you, I'm not afraid of failure
When life was blurry, you made it clearer
And God forbid, if you died now
I know that I'd be well taken care of
I know you'll be there waiting for me
I just wanna be just like you
I wanna be anything like you
I wanna be just like you

Yo, what's up, this is Joyner, I'm unable to take your call right now, leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
It's really Valentine's Day and I'm sitting here thinking I'm about to get a gift from this man but this man can't even buy me a good dress because it's fucking Tuesday. So why should I expect a gift on Valentine's Day? And I'm here    chewing on some fucking bubblegum waiting on some hard dick that's probably in the next bitch right now. So you know what? I'ma go find me my own chocolate9Embed
