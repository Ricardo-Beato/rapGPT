43 ContributorsSkypager Lyrics
Do you know the importance of a skypager?
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Those who don't believe, see you're laid behind
Got our skypagers on all the time
Hurry up and get yours cause I got mine
Especially if you do shows, they come in fine
If you're with a G and you're sipping wine
Eating cacciatore with a twist of lime
Gotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9
Joint by base, then you get your high

If you get your high, then mines is next
The 'S' in skypage really stands for sex
Beeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks
Keep my bases loaded like the New York Mets
At times I miss the pager so you don't get vex
Having bad days like a voodoo hex
Conceptually, a pager is so complex
That I be standing by the phone, ready to flex

Welcome, wel-wel-welcome to the new skypager
Wel-welcome to the new skypager
Welcome to the new skypager, new skypager
Enter telephone number or other numeric message
You might also like
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky

The batteries I use are called Duracell
They last for three weeks so they do me well
Don't be going through no phases, my joint stays on
24-7, from dusk til dawn
If you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach
Your greed for the Phifer, I can be reached
A number of importance, I just put it on lock
You leave code '69", that means you want some ****

People tend to think that a pager's foul
Well it kinda is cause it makes me scowl
But it really hurts when you're on the prowl
Brothas know it hurts when you're on the prowl
Grabbin' on my joint cause I'm an eager owl
Get paged by a G or a business pal
My shit is overflowin', they won't allow
Another page, so I'll just end this now
