Boy what you lookin' for? You know where them cookies are
Yeah, I caught yo' ass red-handed in that cookie jar

Brookie, he rookie, he want the cookie, the cookie
I think you thirsty, you milkin' it, tryna crook me, mistook me
For something sweet, and you're right, but I can't be that tonight
Love had her shavin' it clean, but now that pussy on Wookiee, boy
Go and handle your part, caught you with hands in that jar
Suckin' that sweet tooth, that canker sore, too low, need to crank it more
And you know you've been savin' for all them bitches who pay you more
He call me Oreo, break it and lick the flavor off, and

Everybody like, "Notice me, Senpai"
Y'all niggas all woe is me, woe is me
On the billboard, that's me Senpai
Y'all niggas ain't cold as me
Hold my hoops, knock it out cold, all these hands tied
I fight for the cause, and tight with ya broad
'Cause I can afford that, drama come, I ignore that
Fuck talkin', she record that, Pokémon Go, you Snorlax
Swear they been sleepin' on me, I give you Hollywood tease
Breakfast at Tiffany's, ain't got a reason to be seein' me
You seein' all that's to see, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

Boy I know that you need that choco-chip
I got extra taco but you better bring that macho grip
Not gon' fuck around, you had me fooled, thinkin' you not gon' slip
It's my modern life, make me wanna find some Rocko dick
I will dig it up and bring that shit back like some moccasins
You don't want these problems, fuck a promise, I will not forget
I thought love was blind but you lookin', tryna find a trick fine as this
You won't get these sweets again, like Violet, you childish
