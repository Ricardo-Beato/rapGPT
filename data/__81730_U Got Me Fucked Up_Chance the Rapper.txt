76 ContributorsU Got Me Fucked Up Lyrics

Chance The Rapper
10 Day

Stupid ass student, true, I got truants in Spanish
Beats by Inglish, rap Chanish
Fluent, can't fly, got flew in, I'm foolin'
Adidas influence Nike, I do's it
Coolin' with Mikey, low-key I rock
Mags on my bike, Tay like he chuck
Hockey I puck, Rockie, I fresh
Saki, my cup, like Rocky, "Wassup"
Ooh he got two weeks ten with the foolie
Doobie sawbuck, school be too huff
Caleb my nigga, Fresco my nigga
Gon head send it up, SAVEMULA too tough

This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money
Said this ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money
This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money
Said this ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money

Wavy, so wavy, trendin', I'm trendy
Bending these pennies mommy done gave me
Business so savvy, savey, no spendy
Drifty so empty, city so windy
Master champ Chancelor, TrapMan the Chance or
Vance the bag handler, Bagger Vance
Pants is baggy, Vans rancid, band of bad bandits
Abandoned bandanas, banned from band practice
Sentence so gavel, wordplay so Scrabble
Chance to split atoms slit Adam apples
Adamant Chano rat-a-tat vandals
Had to have at em' as an example

This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money
Said this ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money
This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money
Said this ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money13Embed
