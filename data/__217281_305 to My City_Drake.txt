105 Contributors305 to My City Lyrics
Drop down, drop-drop (Shit is real out here)
Drop down, drop-drop
Drop-drop-drop down, drop-drop
Get it (Yeah)
Get it
Drop down, drop-drop

Oooh, I got the 305 to my city
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it
I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it
We did it, we did it
We so far from finished
I brought you right back just so we can relive it

I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed, baby
I'm with you, I'm with it, oh
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it
You might also like
They don't work hard as you
Damn, that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count
Numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money
Girl, you just did it
I get it, I get it
Man, fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar
Your roommate got credit
Twelve months on the lease
That's a come-up, baby, don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy
Every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds
You sparkle, but fuck, man, the spark ain't enough for you

Oooh, I got the 305 to my city
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it
I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it
We did it, we did it
We so far from finished
I brought you right back just so we can relive it
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed, baby
I'm with you, I'm with it, oh
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it

Tonight was your night
Go get you some lobsters and shrimp
You smart and you know it
I get it, I get it, you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall
That's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story
I get it, you did it, you did it
Got a link on the champagne
Your best friend is bartending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes
Let 'em know that you run shit
I get it, I get it
I'm working too hard, let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city
Heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI?
I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl, get your paperwork right"
I get it, I get it
What's up for the night?
Oooh, I got the 305 to my city
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it
I get it, I get it
We just did it, we did it
We did it, we did it
We so far from finished
I brought you right back just so we can relive it

I get it, get it, get it
Drop down, drop-drop down
I get it, get it, get it
Drop down, drop-drop down

Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday, oh Lord
Oh Lord, we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore (Yeah)88Embed
