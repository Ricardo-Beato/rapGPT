What's happening
1017 shit nigga
One Zero One Seven
Fuck nigga
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
Don't even go out with that nigga or you gon' be embarrassed
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
He said we flashin' with money 'cause he ain't got nothin' to flash

Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed (ooh)
He say I cherish my money but he ain't got nothing to cherish
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
I got on so many carats yo' man should be embarrassed
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed (ooh)
He say I cherish my money but he ain't got nothing to cherish
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
I got on so many carats yo' man should be embarrassed

I said hola, low eyes, I jumped, I go here
I'm in too deep, still need me some more here
I'm pulling up, hot, drop top some foreign
And me and Gucci Mane came to stunt, got something for ya
Ayy, count all my money and then I let it all go
And I see they all on me, they know I got dinero
And everyone checkin' on me, they wonder where I came from
And I been going outrageous, man, ever since I came up
Ayy, call my phone, call my phone, I don't know ya
Just stop right now, don't get embarrassed
And then I check on the rollie, and I ain't got the time
I'm ballin' out somethin' stupid, my wrists on thirty thou'

Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
He say I cherish my money but he ain't got nothing to cherish
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
I got on so many carats yo' man should be embarrassed
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
He say I cherish my money but he ain't got nothing to cherish
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
I got on so many carats yo' man should be embarrassed

I only made 4 million last year
Threw a Rolex on my ankle, just to not be humble
100 day, 100 cities, can't remember no names
Don't ask me no questions, I don't do interviews
40 bands on my right hand, 8 grand on my left
'Bout to flex at Panda Express, diamond, carats, no marriage
Rubies blushing out in Paris, diamonds, carats, no marriage
Rubies blushing out in Paris, I don't do Snapchats
I ain't do Snapchats, I don't do behind the scenes
Walking straight off the plane, to a tint-up limousine
Brick Squad bandannas wrapped around car antennas
Mr. Pound student-faculty, Mr. Brick off a balcony
(For real)

Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed (ooh)
He say I cherish my money but he ain't got nothing to cherish
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
I got on so many carats yo' man should be embarrassed
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed (ooh)
He say I cherish my money but he ain't got nothing to cherish
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
I got on so many carats yo' man should be embarrassed
Yeah, everyday man we do this
Gucci wassup mane, free Gucci
Sean King what up
Don't trip man, It's your boy Lil B man

Young Based God ain't never been embarrassed
Your bitch is so ugly, my bitch is flawless
My bitch from Oakland, she might be from Richmond
Cal Berkeley Bears, I tackle all my bitches
Top floor, luke hall, waterfront bitch
South Berkeley bitch, rich nigga clique
I think that I'm Drake, I think that I'm Makonnen
Call me filthy rich, I got your main bitch holing
Young Based God with the East Atlanta snow and
Based World legend, everybody knowing
Call me A$AP Rocky, yeah I'm so cocky
Straight west side, tell your bitch to come watch me

Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed (ooh)
He say I cherish my money but he ain't got nothing to cherish
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
I got on so many carats your man should be embarrassed
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed (ooh)
He say I cherish my money but he ain't got nothing to cherish
Don't be embarrassed baby, he'll make you feel embarrassed
I got on so many carats yo' man should be embarrassed3Embed
