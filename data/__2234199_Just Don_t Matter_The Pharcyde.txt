10 ContributorsJust Donâ€™t Matter Lyrics
Same as it ever was...

Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed

In times recent I haven't been content
Since my ears and years realized the abstraction of content;
Lyrical
All across the continent they took it and they filled it with   Some moralist material
Way back in the days it used to be varieties like cereal
And to bring it back I think it's gonna take a miracle, reason
We brung the fresh to get ya hung
So all tongues of gibberish, I wish they'd be done
Run, away far with no tussle
Cause it seems like all these guys are paralyzed
Up in the mental muscle
What they need to be is muzzled
Imani got the pieces, but I still feel puzzled
Phonies run out fast cause all the gas gets guzzled
But what time reveals is that he steals the rest
They're all stealing that will when they're under pressure
Dealing in stolen treasures for their personal pleasures
And that's wrong, you know that's not right
That's why every night I go in my room and I write
In the boom, in my room
Cause it's all good, G
And that's the way that everything should be
You might also like
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed

Many kingdoms rely on its people
That makes the balance equal so we all make moss
Serving common duties of the man on his block
Making ends meet the means into fiending at the park
Now black zeus stole crack, got beat with bumper jacks
And cats too laid back got jacked
Seeing a sister almost pass on my grandma's grass
Because the brother tried to stomp the fuckin juice out her ass
I never knew the real story
Grammar break bone
They going to wash away the sins in evil men
Gave up Pratt and a her pimp
Too much crime, the wretchest shit
And the places he'd been; I won't quit
Cause those who pose about the streets just lie in the pits
Where the shoe fits em, and yo
I can't get with them due to the fact that life is just
Somethin' they lack and they won't confess
They need a little somethin' like soul in their chest
And some love up in their shit, and they will be blessed
And ya don't stop, just some cultivation of the crops
And none of this shit is for the props
Straight from the top, so now don't ya miss
Cause all of you suckers will get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed

To me you ain't nothing
Gone with my weed, the done deal
The best rapper in the world blowing right now, forreal
You call that shit skill?
Nigga, please suck my dick
In one hand I got a mic, in the other an open fist
What? You want to get wrapped up or smacked
Like a  Innocent victims of my show
But it ain't their rhymes punk, cause Buckwheat said so
I'm penetrating, escalating my devastation
Proves that I removes emcees like prayers to Satan
Rebuke
Cause you blowing up? It's a flook
I'm doper than that fool that you hide behind in your group
Loop the last two lines I just said
Play it over again ten times in your head
Weak link, like a midget in quicksand you sink
I out-think ya, see through your whole outfit
I'm irresistible, unmissable, Buckwheat's the shit
Like an elephant, bitch rapper don't forget it
Steppers like pulling blenders in gunfights, you with it
Rhyme riddler, making niggas hail me like Hitler
Insane, everybody do the Kurt Cobain, the greatest rapper
That ever lived; Buckwheat and that's my nameEmbed
