10 ContributorsPissin’ on ’Em Lyrics
Lil, Lil Kim
It's called Pissin' On 'Em
You know what we doing here
Let's go Big Mike

Shitted on 'em, I'm just pissin' on 'em
Spittin' on 'em
Put your middle fingers in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, I'm just pissin' on 'em
Spittin' on 'em
Put your middle fingers in the air if you did it on 'em
I just shitted on 'em

All these bitches is my pets
I keep a tight leash around their necks
Bitches try to bite take their ass to the vet
Put 'em right to sleep like they popped a Xanax
Uh, yeah, I be shittin' on 'em
Spittin on 'em
Kimmy go in, I go extra hard
I swipe your whole life with my debit card

Shitted on 'em, I'm just pissin' on 'em
Spittin' on 'em
Put your middle fingers in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, I'm just pissin' on 'em
Spittin' on 'em
Put your middle fingers in the air if you did it on 'em

The Lamborghini turns into Megatron
Got 'em blue in the face, A-a-avatar
I be shittin on 'em, diarrhoea
You bitches lookin' burnt, gonorrhoea
Same bitches throwin' shots, but tryna be her
I guess it's all politics, Condoleezza
I'm the first lady, Her Majesty
Raps royalty, bitch now you work for me

Shitted on 'em, I'm just pissin' on 'em
Spittin' on 'em
Put your middle fingers in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, I'm just pissin' on 'em
Spittin' on 'em
Put your middle fingers in the air if you did it on 'em
Yeah, I just did it on 'em

All you clones had your shine like cubic stones
Now the show's over, Jenny Jones
Toss 'em in the lake like Ricky bitch
And I stay on this money, like a pyramid
Yeah, I've been about a cheque, hoe
You stole your whole swag, you worse than a klepto'
I just blow 'em kisses, X 'n' O
Got 'em sick to their stomach, P-p-pepto
All you bitches is some bums
I feel your cup up with change
You hoes should be rappin' on the number four train
The price of your mother's house, I paid for my Range
Uh, and that's a autobiography
I swear these hoes be obsessed how they copy me
Laxative flow, I'm shittin' on 'em constanly
And I leave a stain like I ain't wiped my ass properly
Ew!Embed
