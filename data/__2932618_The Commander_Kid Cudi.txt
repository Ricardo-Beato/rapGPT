No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah

Couldn't tell a lie, I been did mine
So I figured I'd be off to take off to somewhere new (Ahh), hey
And make some memories (Ahh), yeah
In the middle of the night
I'm standin' in the moon's beam
Blowin' off some steam
Wonderin' how I got so done with the high
Not so pleased (Ahh)
No I wouldn't let it show (Ahh)
I always try and outrun my pride
And it keeps close
You very well know you can't run from who you are (Ahh)
Oh you soon see (Ahh)
I tune my mind, body, soul so close
To find out how I'm supposed to walk through the faces of flames (Ahh), hey
Oh, you're in control (Ahh)

So in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
So in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
Ohh
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah

The commander

Tryna catch a vibe, starin' at the light
And I gotta make it count
To leap bounds
Soarin' over trees (Ahh)
Oh look at me go (Ahh)
In the middle of the day
I hear it in the prophecy, can't come down
It grows in my heart, not knowin' where it goes
Search through pain (Ahh)
And the wishes with the rain (Ahh)
I seem to deny all that blinding light
That only glows to those that really can't run
On just who they are (Ahh)
It's clear as can be (Ahh)
No need to lie into your emerald soul
You surely know gold is always in your glow
Why not let it shine? (Ahh), hey
You're in control of the dream (Ahh)
You're so in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
So in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
So in control
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
