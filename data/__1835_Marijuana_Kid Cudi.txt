Yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Pretty green bud, all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, ooh, marijuana, yeah
Pretty green bud all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, ooh, I know you wanna smoke

I-I-I be on it all day
Like my nigga Big Boi said
That's the only thing that keep me level
Up in my crazy head
Stoned on the run-run, no fun if not
It's Scotty from the email read
Man, I swear to keep it one hundred
And if I ain't have it, then I'll be dead
My soul's been fed tonight
Everything that I choose, still can't forget Grey Goose
Converse covered with mixer juice
And all my niggas rolling up in the booth
Who got me on another one?
Someone please roll me another one
They tell me all good things must end
But those motherfuckers ain't have this friend
I keep
You might also like
Pretty green bud, all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, ooh, marijuana, yeah
Pretty green bud all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, ooh, I know you wanna smoke

La-la-la, yeah
La-la-la, yeah
La-la-la, yeah, marijuana
La-la-la, yeah
La-la-la, yeah
La-la-la, yeah
Oh, I know you wanna smoke


Pretty green bud, all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, ooh, marijuana, yeah
Pretty green bud all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, ooh, I know you wanna smoke
Always had my back, hey (La-la-la, yeah)
Always had my back, hey (La-la-la, yeah)

Always had my back, yeah (La-la-la, yeah)

I know you wanna smoke
