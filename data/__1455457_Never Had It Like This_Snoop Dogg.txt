5 ContributorsNever Had It Like This Lyrics
You never had it like this
You never had it like this
You go get another if you want

You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You'll love it in a minute
Glass so full, team got pull with c club full of women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You love it when I'm in it
Glass so full, team got pull with a club full of women
That's how we living

Girl I do you the way, you want me to
Put them panties right to a side
I ain't got a problem picking you down 
Keep going I have to tell your homegirl, do you over
The best it's on the west side baby
And these niggas over here keep you goin crazy
Yeah, yeah

You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You'll love it in a minute
Glass so full, team got pull with c club full of women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You love it when I'm in it
Glass so full, team got pull with a club full of women
That's how we living
You might also like
Walked in the club with it
Gave her straight dick, you in love with her
My homie G-d up at the club with her
Eight seven six months, sold drugs with her
A good girl, is what she wants, no molly, no drink, and no bud
So I don't really wanna try to learn you on
A lot of things I'm tryna do is just to turn you on
If I can get you to my flat on my futon
Take your dress  off slow and get my groove on
Hit you with the bife  face
Stick it to the baby in the right place

You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You'll love it in a minute
Glass so full, team got pull with c club full of women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You love it when I'm in it
Glass so full, team got pull with a club full of women
That's how we living

On the roof top she gonna need that
Eighty seven was wild I use to be that
I'm givin the D she giving feed-back
The homies is wild, where the weed at?
And where the home girls? I don't even know
I had two off they cushing  Moscato
A ratchet or a model, we drinking out the bottle
My whole act to follow, more booze than Apollo 
Yeah I'm a G I'm a monster baby
I ain't see that piece of ass I can't conquer baby
Probably hiding on these hoes like a jack rabbit
Snoop and Warren on these hose back to back in it
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You'll love it in a minute
Glass so full, team got pull with c club full of women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You love it when I'm in it
Glass so full, team got pull with a club full of women
That's how we living
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You'll love it in a minute
Glass so full, team got pull with c club full of women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You love it when I'm in it
Glass so full, team got pull with a club full of women
That's how we livingEmbed
