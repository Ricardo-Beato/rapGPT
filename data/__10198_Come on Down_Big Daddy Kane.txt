Ahhh
Check, check it out
Come on down, come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down, come on down

Come on down, come on down, come on down, come on down
(Well, here I come)
Come on down, come on down, come on down, come on down
(Ayo, Kane, give 'em some)

When I'm in motion it's just like the flow of the ocean
The weight of the words swerve and curve
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas
Quick as a Lamborghini, smooth as a Lexus
I guess that makes me the top of the line
Oh yes I'm the most prime of all time
Cause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin
And the lyrics just start to flowing
Ahem ahem, coughing couldn't stop me from going
On with the rapture, so that I capture your mind
With state of the art music made to adapt to
To knowledge the God on the groove
Because when my tongue moves, I just love that I'm smooth
Do it with these and in times I leave reas
To give em a little of the flavor that please
As I'm schooling the rule in pursuing and doing and
Reigning again and the gunning and stunning and
Thrilling and chilling, collecting the rent and
Jammin and slammin and damn it's
Too much for one mind to comprehend
A pure blend, the way that I make words mend
And, the way that I be doin rappers in
Michael Bivins couldn't make these Boyz II Men
I display, somethin verbally, capable to murder the
Average MC, the tough ones I'll burn third degree
And if you're thinkin that I'm takin a beating
You're sure to see the Pink Panther speakin'
You might also like
Come on down, come on down, come on down, come on down
(Well, here I come)
Come on down, come on down, come on down, come on down
(Q-Tip, just give 'em some!!!)

I'm a native New Yorker, I pitch a lot of porker
When I get my ride, I be the grill squawker
Tip's a smooth talker, I love Alice Walker
So get off the dillz and step back you little hawker
Better yet, you hooker, you wanna show I book ya
The highest way I took ya, is you's a good looker
Queens is residential, I make the presidentials
Over instrumentals, I utilize the mentals
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square-a
If you went in by yourself it was a terror
See, I could do that cause my crew is kinda phat
Outside we had the toolies, out West, you call em gats
It's that, oh thanks, chat, well let me drop some more shit
Bring your bats and balls and please don't forfeit
Cause you won't get away, your status will be stank
You can ride with me G I'm goin to the bank
To meet up with Kane, up on Dollar Lane
You get the idea, cause page times is near
So rappers see they bug cause they really can't handle
Position for the rapping, cause some of them be slackin'
Not in this corner, for we block out the devil
The three different flavors, you know we on the level
Come on down, come on down, come on down, come on down
(Uh, here I come)
Come on down, come on down, come on down, come on down
(Busta Rhymes, won't you give 'em some)

Check it out, uh!
As I come down and get dumb
This roughneck, swingin' all over the drum
Swimmin in the, track, retaliatin thorough is how I react
Busta Rhymes will attack
As you feel the pain, bass kick impacts to the brain
Got a mega, mega migraine
What up, to the Big Daddy and Tip
My trip, flip the rhyme, then I dip
Hey, hip-hop, rude, bust a interlude
Wack be up on the stage getting booed
This structure it takes, bust the angle of three different flavors
On a young raider choc well that's my vocal fader
Keep my volume on extra boom!
All the vains in my neck symbolizes that I want room
Word up, uh! Here I am, damn
Dragon slayer stackin layer after layer
This jam will be ran while the record flim flam
Wiggle your front pram, to the runnin man
Sam, Busta, Rhyme, comin on time
L.O.N.S. D, rip a new design
Flavor one, taste the unborn baby
Flip before you move or catch a bad one, baby
Chiggy change chump, the over sized puff
Busta pump you and the love, and then I rump
Emotional stare point, for the wild
Busta buckwild musically direct from Strong Isle
Unload, catch you like smell later
Dig on your taste of the third flavor, rrrarrrRHHH
RAARRRRH! Direct from the lungs of the dragon, uh!5Embed
