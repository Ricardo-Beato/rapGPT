If you know god is working in your life
Shout it
If you know god then you're gon' be alright
Shout it
If you know god and you know what he's like
Shout it
If you know god then just jump and shout it
Shout it

Time wasting, wrong things that I'm chasing
Eating but don't like what I'm tasting
Everything I thought I want and hunted for
Had me wondering what did I want it for
Headed down the wrong path, self-destructive
What's my function? I know I am good for something
Lord let me know if my suffering will be in vain
Or how much longer will it rain?
Or how much longer will a stain
By the blood has been shed through out my life, remain
Or how much longer will the pain in the flame
The only thing i gave the game is saying your name
You might also like

If you know god is working in your life
Shout it
If you know god then youre gon' be alright
Shout it
If you know god and you know what he's like
Shout it
If you know god then just jump and shout it
Shout it

I went from "why bother" to "Imma  try harder"
Knowing the only way to make it is through my Father
Stay right beside me, though the ride was rough
And for a minute the devil tied me up
But like clock work , when the clock works, he was right on time
And I was so happy to see him that it had me crying
Then enjoyed him, knowing you got a savior
Starting to be changing your behavior
Make you wanna shout more, make you wanna live more
You could do without more make you wanna give more
This is what I live for, this is why I do
What I do, It ain't for me, It's for you
If you know god is working in your life
Shout it
If you know god then youre gon' be alright
Shout it
If you know god and you know what he's like
Shout it
If you know god then just jump and shout it
Shout itEmbed
