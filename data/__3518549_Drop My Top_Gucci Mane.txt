Drop my top anytime I wanna
I'ma drop my top on the dope man corner
Drop my top anytime I wanna
And I dropped the price on the dope man corner

Drop, drop
Gotta buy me that drop, drop
These fiends want that trap, trap
You know those hoes gon' drop, drop

I'ma drop my top anytime I wanna
She drop her top but you must have dollars
Drop my top anytime I wanna
She drop her top but you must have dollars
Drop, drop
These fiends love that trap, trap
Drop my top anytime I wanna
Drop my top but you must have dollars

Bugatti in Sun Valley and it look outta place
I move your bitch outta place first date outta State
I made the plug drop the ticket on my last package
And I dropped your ex-wife like a bad habit
Dropping money everywhere, a lil' cabbage
And I dropped your CEO, don' need no extra baggage
I have a Chevy Caprice the same color a' gum drop
A dark skinned girl but don't listen to none but punk rock
Not ashamed to say my career started off that straight drop
Reminiscing running round with the deuce pack
I hold the pot sideways like O-Dog did when he shot the Glock
I'm serving rapper weed, OG kush, yeah, that TuPac
(Guwop)

Drop, drop
Gotta buy me that drop, drop
These fiends want that trap, trap
You know those hoes gon' drop, drop

I'ma drop my top anytime I wanna
She drop her top but you must have dollars
Drop my top anytime I wanna
She drop her top but you must have dollars
Drop, drop
These fiends love that trap, trap
Drop my top anytime I wanna
Drop my top

Drop my top anytime I wanna
I'ma drop my top on the dope man corner
Drop my top anytime I wanna
And I dropped the price on the dope man cornerEmbed
