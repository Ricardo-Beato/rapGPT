3 ContributorsSmooth Operator_Ref Lyrics
Goddamn, goddamn, conversations with people
Crazy how one day, the legends forget that they equal
On this Under Pressure sequel
We not taking it back, we keepin' it pushing
People scared of change
But you'll find me deep in the cushion
Even when I win, it feel like I'm losing
Listening to beats, in the Bimmer cruisin'
I think I got another hit, I could feel my body bruisin'
What's the conclusion? Or rather, my hypothesis
I'm darker than Gotham is
Reading Nostradamus at 90 degrees
You better believe
I know how to turn a profit with ease (Suck my dick!)
Diacritical lifestyle, I'm always overseas
Hurricane Bobby in the studio blowing trees
Switch the topic, I drop it
Fuck around then leave them all concussed
When I bust, no thrust, world we livin' in is fucked
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty one
Your new shit ain't good as your old shit
'Til your new shit is your old shit, son
And then some, let me get some
I wear this 24 karat solid gold Rollie for my son
As an heirloom, not for looking dope as I rhyme
As a representation to give your family your time
Searching for love in the industry you'll be let down
They don't love you 'til you dead and then they call you profound
No matter how mainstream you was in the end, you still underground
That's the truth, feeling close to the cliff, like Rick Dalton in the booth
Money ain't the key to happiness and this the truth
Modern day rap is like a golden era spoof
But a few of us were searching within the second renaissance
And I know that my debutantes
Keeping the legacy going
By flowing so involuntarily seamless
Me and my team is finally reaping
What we been sowing like a seamstress
I said I'm on one, I know I'm unsung
Was livin' my life backward like Tariq on Undun
And now they wonder how I got over son (Do you want more?)
Hell yeah, now check the method
I been livin' outside of pages for ages
Now I'm back, Chocolate City, home of percussion, Maryland on my back
From Takoma Park, all the way to Southeast DC
It feel like forever ago, it feel like BC
Everlasting life, kickin' rhymes in the parking lot at night
Inhale, exhale, people hate
Oh well, 2012
Dreamin' I'm a freshman on XXL
2013, on the cover XXL
Livin' life behind these bars with no intention of postin' bail
'Cause I prevail
But that's a story for another time
Story for another rhyme
And on my darkest days, I know that the sun will shine, eventually
Greatest lyricist to ever do it, yeah essentially
And if we're being modest then potentially
And if we're being honest then...
You might also like
I'm just an entity, my DNA not my identity
Findin' serenity, become a better man, I better be
For the child in my baby momma's tummy, never crummy
We can make bread, tryna be the greatest, that shit been dead
I'm tryna be the happiest that I can be instead
I'm tryna get ahead like a fetus, money don't complete us
Or defeat us, it can lead us to depression
Bein' rich is not a blessin', fame is not a blessin'
Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous I learned that lesson
What's the meanin' of life? To live it, what I'm guessin'

Time is undefeated, in the end, it beats us all
My daddy, my momma, myself, we all destined to fall
Currently, the most important thing within my life is balance
I ain't talkin' commas and zeros or monetary (Challenge)
Talkin' self-worth, put yourself first, don't worry 'bout the worst
But when you in this position, it's hard to make selfish decisions
Got enough bread, I'ma eat, but what about the rest, my team?
They good and all, but I mean, if I disappeared from the scene
Then what's gon' happen? What's gon' happen?
In a hotel writin' rhymes before I headline at a festival
But all thatâ€™s runnin' through my mind is bottom lines and decimals
So focused on the brand sometimes forget about the Man
Reflectin' in the mirror with this pen in his hand
99 percent of these people will never understand, supply and demand
'Cause I'm in the public eye, they think they know who I am
Oh, shit, it's Logic! Can I have a picture?" They don't give a damn
Soon as they see me, they clench the device that's in they hand
Don't even say hello, more like, "Can I get one for the 'Gram?"
That's when I be like, "Fuck no, but you can shake my hand
Let's have a conversation, talk about life man-to-man
You disappointed, I can read your body language like a paragraph"
"Logic, yeah, that's cool and all, but I'd much prefer a photograph
I mean, can I have a photograph?"
Goddamn, all these people nowadays are so unusual
They'd rather snap a pic with you to get more likes than usual
Than have a conversation, back in the basement with no placement
Couldn't never fathom talkin' to my favorite rapper that wayEmbed
