That's how it works
The world
That's how
It works
That's how it works
The world
That's how
It works
That's how it works

It happened last morning
It happened last morning
It happened last morning
It happened last morning
There was a flash, no warnings
Got stabbed with a swordfish
It's probably not that important
It happened last morning
It happened last-

I flew back from Saskatoon
I knew what I had to do
Tryna lose all my attitude
There's no beef in a bowl full of rabbit food
You might also like
Shoulder to shoulder, no chance to move
Never had a pair of dancing shoes
But I've had a panic attack at First Avenue
In the back stall at the back of the bathroom

I stand up with the last of the laughs
Might as well put all of the cash in the trash
I guess I shoulda brought a biggеr duffle bag
Feel like I'm suffocating in this yellow cab

Don’t lеt the camera snap you in half
Take a little bit back to the lab
A lily pad full of tadpoles needs a dad
The phonograph played Massive Attack

They said it's lonely at the top
You lookin' like you trying to find some alone time
Click the calendar, schedule a nosedive
I'll meet you at the ocean at low tide

If you can roll your eyes, then you can open your eyes
To be the spokes and the headlights
You're flying, you took it to new heights
My pupils are giant, looking like Moon Pies
It's just a part of the character arc
I pull over, put the car into park
Turned out the lights, starin' into the dark
Turned off the motor, I can hear my heart

Release the seatbelt, then inhale like I'm in Hell
I told myself, I’m tryna heal this broken spell
But you can tell this the most alive I've ever felt

It happened last morning
It happened last morning
It happened last morning
It happened last morningEmbed
