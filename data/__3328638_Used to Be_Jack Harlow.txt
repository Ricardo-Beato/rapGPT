8 ContributorsUsed to Be Lyrics
Every time I'm in your neck of the woods, I'm thinkin' 'bout how it used to be
And I've been wondering if you left me for good, 'cause shit just ain't how it used to be
I sent a text around like midnight or so, you hit me back around two or three
And told me that you feel the same and you get me, but shit just ain't how it used to be
I know that things change, I ain't stupid, no
But maybe if you felt the same, nah it's stupid, nah
I guess I don't know what to say or what I'm doing lately, I've been on a wave
Maybe you were just the one that got away
Either way, oh no

Every time I'm in your neck of the woods, I'm thinkin' 'bout how it used to be
Thinkin' back how it used to be
And I've been wondering if you left me for good, 'cause shit just ain't how it used to be
Shit just ain't how it used to be
I sent a text around like midnight or so, you hit me back around two or three
And told me that you feel the same and you get me, but shit just ain't how it used to be
It just ain't how it used to be
I know that things change, I ain't stupid, no
But maybe if you felt the same, nah it's stupid, nah
I guess I don't know what to say or what I'm doing lately, I've been on a wave
Maybe you were just the one that got away
Either way, oh no
