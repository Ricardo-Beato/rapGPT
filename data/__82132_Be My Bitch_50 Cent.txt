8 ContributorsBe My Bitch Lyrics
Shawty say she straight, can't wait till tonight to turn her out babe
Take her to a different world, get her baby girl

(50 Cent)
I'll pick you up at 8, we can call it a first date (get her baby)
We gonna have some drinks on me, it my treat, you ain't gotta pay

Take her ass downtown, in my Bentley drop top show her all around
Later when we get back we can show her how we live
Man she take it off as soon as she step foot in the crib

Your so sweet come see me, I'm gonna give you what you need
You can be my bitch

You can be my bitch

You can be my bitch
You can be my bitch
I'm gonna take you to the spot jump on top
I'm gonna give you everything that I got
You can be my bitch
You might also like
You can be my bitch

You can be my bitch
You can be my bitch

My girl got a girl friend I call her my play thing
Why would I complain shes everything to me man
We match together perfect isn't this amazing isn't this amazing
Back massage minaj they turned on I'm hard
Great sex latex I'm playing my part
Penetration oral fixation no camera taking we making the head boards shaking
Until its damn near breaking
I can tell you from the get go
So you know how this shit go
This thing I got with my bitch is so ill its mental
I'm about to break it down all the freaky shit we into
If your not into her your into me and well still get u

Right when we get to the crib step right in
Boy you know what they say
You can be my bitch
Your so sweet come see me, I'm gonna give you what you need
You can be my bitch
You can be her bitch

You can be my bitch
You can be my bitch

You can be my bitch
You can be my bitch
I'm gonna take you to the spot jump on top
I'm gonna give you everything that I got
You can be my bitch

You can be her bitch

You can be my bitch
You can be my bitch

I'm headed out of state, I got a jet ready on the runway baby
I'll be gone for a while I'm leaving you in charge now haha haha
Shwaty wanna play at anytime I'm away it ain't OK
But when I come back you know that's how its going down
Well be back up in this bitch passing her around
You don't want me just to play my roll
You don't want me to come take control
You don't want me to move in too slow
You just wanna see me run this show
Lets go lets go lets go
