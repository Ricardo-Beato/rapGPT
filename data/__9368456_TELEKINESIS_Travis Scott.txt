Used to wanna fuck an R&B bitch, then that shit happened, yeah, yeah (Pluto)
Used to wanna be rich, then it finally happened
Thought it'd make me happy (Thought it'd make me happy)

I could've took the pain and I could've went out sad
Streets stepped in and raised me, but I ain't have my daddy
Niggas tryna clone me, run off with my swag
From sellin' coco, got Chanel on my jacket (Jacket)
Shawty give me mop with the less, it don't last (Last)
Takin' more drugs all alone in a mansion
Walkin' around tweakin' with the yop in my hands (Walkin' around tweakin')
Just another broke ho just preachin' for thеse bands (Just another ho)
And I know I'm due for a billion-dollar advancе (Uh-huh)

I can see the future, I can see the future (I can see the future)
I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life (Livin' in glory)
Won't you take the wheel? And I recline and I sit still
Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds? (Like the way it sound)

You know the future of the bounce, ayy
I can hear your thoughts so loud, I can hear the crowd so loud
Do you like the way it sounds? Ayy
I can hear your thoughts so loud, I can hear the crowd so loud (So loud)
You might also like
I can see the future
Ride with Wolf and Storm' and some troopers
Ridin' through this shit, this shit is stupid
Sky walkin' 'round like I'm Luke-uh
Duckin' all these convos like I'm Bruce-uh, super
Mobbin' with my angels dodgin' Lucifer (Mob)
Seein' every angle, I can see through ya, yeah (Yeah)

I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky (Seen enough)
I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life (Livin' in glory)
Won't you take the wheel? And (Seen enough) I recline and I sit still
Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?
You know the future of the bounce

Count so much money 'til my skin peel
Cherry-red Benz like the real pimp (Yeah)
My bro cook up dope, it take real skill
Share my bitch with my ho, ain't got no chill (No)
You either gettin' to money or you're gossipin' (Yeah)
She chose up, put on this coat, now she lottery

Places I thought I'd never go I fly models in
I hear the demons clear when they callin' (Yeah)
Flyest on the Earth, so I had to name myself a planet (Pluto)
Automatic dead when you goin' against my family
Few breakups went public, I just bought another baddie (Bought another baddie)
Bitch knew I was toxic, when she met me, I was a savage (Met me, I was a savage)
High in the hills tryna avoid any madness (Yeah)
Private on the Lear, this just like we imagined
Only settlin' for this Hi-Tech 'cause I ain't got the Actavis (Yeah)
I'm tryna be modest (Yeah), it sound like I'm braggin' (Braggin')
Cartier my frames (Frames), all because my fame (Fame)
Bitch said she ashamed to love me in public, rather go private (Seen enough)
Count so much money 'til my skin peel
Cherry-red Benz like the real pimp
My bro cook up dope, it take real skill
Share my bitch with my ho, ain't got no chill
You either gettin' to money or you're gossipin'
She chose up, put on this coat, now she lottery

I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life
Won't you take the wheel? And I recline and I sit still
Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?

I can't get enough, told you I just want it all
I can't get enough, you ain't been doin' enough (Do you like the way it sounds?)
So cold, so cold
It's so cold, so cold, so cold

You could see the future, there's a sparkle in your eye
Why you all up on my thigh? Can't let you
Niggas plottin' my demise, I got murder on my mind
I got money on the line, I can't lose if I tried
Let no bitch break my stride
Chosen, I'm gon' bet on me
Chosen, all my shit antique
Frozen, I can't feel no heat
Diamonds dancing on me
You startin' fresh, man, you fell out of pocket
You fucked that girl that you met at the party
I got some new niggas down in the lobby
How can I sleep when you're out catchin' bodies?
I still wanna be with you, trust me, I know that's insane
I'd rather fuck on you than fuck on lames
I did some shit in Berlin, I'm OD
We both ain't shit and it's workin' for me
Workin' for me, yeah
I can see the future, I can see the future18Embed
