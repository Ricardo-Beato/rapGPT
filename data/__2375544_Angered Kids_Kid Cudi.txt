23 ContributorsAngered Kids Lyrics
Yeah Steven, lookout!
Yeah
Hello, hello, doctor, doctor
Doctor, there's something wrong inside of me
There's something, I don't know doctor, help me
Well is there, is there something I can do?
Yeah!

Mmm no remorse, mmm no remorse
Got a couple bundles of dynamite
And some hand grenades
Oh no remorse, oh-oh no remorse
You never should've angered the kids

Yeah
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
The darkness is coming
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
The darkness is coming (Yeah!)
Yeah, oh

No remorse, no remorse (Dangerous force)
Hell like you wouldn't believe
You might also like
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
The darkness is coming
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
The darkness is coming
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Oh you fools start running
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na (Mm-mm-mm-mm)
Dead man walking

Mmm (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right, right (Mmm)
Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yay!
Yay!
Yeah
Left foot, right foot
Right foot, Left foot (Yay!)
Doctor, what am I to do?
What am I to do?

Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
The darkness is coming
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
And guess what it's wanting
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Fools start running
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Dead man walking
MmmEmbed
