Oh, Pete Nice? I'm smoother than him, man, I mean
He wears suits and all, you know no disrespect... *incomprehensible*

Yeah, right, just a thought (* giggling *)

Heavy D, yo, the girls they love me
(* girls crack up *) They love me, I just know it!

Yeah, Positive K? He's dip dip divin'?

Yeah, right

Yeah, LL, yo, he might keep the girls +Jinglin'+
But yo.. I'm the man (* girls crack up *)
I'm the man, as a matter of fact
Yo, see, they laughin' at me, man

I'm the man!
You might also like
Yo, that ain't right
Yo, well, anyway

By the hairs of my chinny-chin-chin, gots many plus plenty
String by string, I think I counts like twenty
If you loan me your ear, I'll return it with interest
If not, I'll simply twist your wrist
So listen up closely, with thoughts to recoup me
'Cause I hope to gross like ten cent per groupie
Now, only if I had two G's per strand
Ask my anchor banker, he understands
I used to wrap my hand around a cold, gold can
Someone once said health is wealth, so check self
I gots a perfect check-up, 'cept for a hiccup, roll with no stick-up
How can I keep the goya nectars on my shelf?
Oh boya, how I searched for an employer
But before Z. L. Huckleberry Finn was in Tom Sawyer
Now, use your imagination, just a smidgeon
If I was a bird, I'd be a pigeon
Succumb one to crumbs and pizza crust, when every fella can
Eat fresh fish and live fat like pelican
Then again, that's only if you're capable for freckles or blue eyes
I settle for Heckle'n'Jeckle
While I chuckle at my man with the cellular phone
The only phone I own's a funky xylophone's tone
Ain't no joy in annoyin' high-pitched ringin'
We do the tap-twist and twitch bringin'
Through soul and this cordless thingamajig
Sure as Subroc's clippers etch and clip to your wig
We'll do the gig so make your mind, thumb twiddlers
The pipe, the bowl or us fiddlers, don't riddle us
I'll even ride a bus till the coast is clear
For okay pay, I say I'm finna 
Now, all this runnin' 'round's kickin' me right in the rear
And still I'm judged by the hairs on my chinny-chin-chin
And I'm able to hit a skin (* girls giggling *)
Just like my man Puba Maxwell, so I'm smooth
Yeah, Kane, he get the job done
But yo, I take care of business

{Peachfuzz} Now, what's up with this peachfuzz nonsense?
{Peachfuzz} What are y'all talkin' about, this peachfuzz?
{Peachfuzz} Nah, I just got one thing to say
{Peachfuzz} Aww, man..

By the hairs of my chinny-chin-chin, six black hairs
String by string, I think I counts five pairs
That's a little, but still, can I get a thumbs up?
At least for the peachfuzz that sums up
A tidbit, yeah, that's it, but who gives a sugar
Honey iced tea besides me
For if, I ever riff, yet and still, they be stiff, they wantin' bills
So I take time just to kill
I say cute is for a bear, teddy bear like Teddy Ruxpin
Would I be handsome if I pimped in a tux then
Smoked a cigar with some black shinin' shoes then
Picked up some friends in my Benz and start cruisin'?
Huh, that's a dream that I ain't even livin' in
If that makes a man, surely I'll recommend
I'll stay a toy boy eatin' Butterfingers
With Knowledge of Self, and coloring books on my shelf
I wanna grow up, 'cause maybe if I did then
I wouldn't be treated like a Toys'R'Us kid when
They counts ten upon my chin
By the hairs of my peachfuzz, let's say each was an inch
Psych! Because I can't pull or pinch
It's a wrench, and I thought life would be a cinch
But anyway, anyhow, let's talk about someway, somehow
That I can make my peachfuzz grow out
Really? Do I need beard that grows with no pause
Just to be respected and resemble Santa Claus?
Hear this clear, I'm a MAN, I tell ya
No dreams or drugs like the slugs will I ever sell ya
A man I am, in the body of a youth
So don't play me like I'm Born-Universe-Truth-Truth
So when I knock at your hearts, let me in
And judge me not by the hairs of my chinny-chin-chin
Yeah, that's what we call, pimpin' presence yo
Call me tonight, knowhatI'msayin?

(* girls laughing *) You got it

Yeah, I eat no pork
So why can't I be as smooth as my man Dr. York?
(* girls crack up *) I see not!

Yo.. I'm smoother than the bottom of Hammer's shoes
After three hundred spins

No love here
No hair on my chest, but my boy Ak West, I'm just smoother
I'm just smoother

Yeah right

I'm definitely smoother than y'all just saw

It's about time!

I'm sayin', yo but, I don't want to hear
{Peachfuzz} None of this peachfuzz nonsense
{Peachfuzz} (Can't understand) Peachfuzz
{Peachfuzz} You know
{Peachfuzz} * girls giggling *

{Peachfuzz} He's a little boy
{Peachfuzz} * giggling *
{Peachfuzz}
{Peachfuzz} * laughing *
{Peachfuzz}
{Peachfuzz}
{Peachfuzz}
{Peachfuzz} .. * fades *8Embed
