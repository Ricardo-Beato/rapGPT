7 ContributorsThe Money (Version 2) Lyrics: Havoc (Prodigy)
(Get bent, keep wilding)
Stop smilin', and still don't nothin' move but the money
(Leavin' permanent scars, like getting splashed on the island)
Stop smilin', but still don't nothin' move but the money
(Gimme yours, or get your manhood taken)
Stop smilin', and still don't nothin' move but the money
(Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin')
(Yo what you wanna do with that black deuce deuce)

Hit you up, take that cash, you ain't slug proof dude
Takin' yours to survive, it's only matter of time
I'm snatchin, livin' grimy, runnin', never look back
The root of evil got me actin' like that
Life ain't a game, the streets is mortal combat
I wasn't blessed with the silver spoon
Since my born, I was doomed, confined to one room
Now you's a customer
Cop it from natural born hustlas (that's what he thought kid)
Stupid son, you get extorted
: Havoc (Prodigy)
Stop smilin, but still don't nothin' move but the money
(New York, New York, get bent, keep wildin')
Stop smilin', and still don't nothin' move but the money
(Leavin' permanent scars, like getting splashed on the island)
Stop smilin', but still don't nothin' move but the money
(Gimme yours, or get your manhood taken)
Stop smilin', and still don't nothin' move but the money
(Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin')
You might also like (Havoc)
Open your eyes, get wise, and look alive, pay attention
I'm manifestin', my slugs be leavin' niggas guessing
You tried to graduate, but didn't know enough lessons
Time is of the essence, and yours is runnin' out
Fast, you won't last, livin' out your life like that
You shoulda got down with my crew, slingin' cracks international
But instead, you wanna merge with the rivals
And moves like that could end up homicidal
You suicidal, and I'm (alive on arrival)
Play the drug game with precision, and never with division
I'm tryna see addition, food to fill my kitchen
Some faggot niggas snitchin' givin' info
We'll do a drive by, in a stolen black pinto
With tinted windows, bullets will flurry through your system
Your man ran, lucky for him, because we missed him
We'll catch him on the rebound, but see now
I'm tryna make this money and you tryna stop me, what's it gonna be now?
You stand up to my crew and get laid down
On the ground with the big four pound
You hear the sound on the other side of town
Where caps get peeled
Break you off, love, love, give you somethin' to feel
: Havoc (Prodigy)
Stop smilin, but still don't nothin' move but the money
(New York, New York, get bent, keep wildin')
Stop smilin', and still don't nothin' move but the money
(Leavin' permanent scars, like getting splashed on the island)
You don't have to tell me twice
I know when to chill when I have to
But if I have to, I'll still clap you
I'll crack through your fortress
You couldn't hold it down, so you lost it
No crew could withstand the forces
Never second guess me, just bless me
Stop smilin', bodies stackin', dead presidents pilin'
We wildin', lifted, terror three sixes
They got a petition, for my conviction
Rise to the occasion
When it's time for blazin', on the 41st side
Niggas is cravin' for beef, we can handle it
It ain't nothin' cause we use to it
It's all good, the hood we ran through it since young
It used to be candy, but now it's guns
Stickin' niggas son, my job ain't done
: Havoc
Stop smilin, but still don't nothin' move but the money
Stop smilin', and still don't nothin' move but the money
Stop smilin', but still don't nothin' move but the money
Stop smilin', and still don't nothin' move but the money1Embed
