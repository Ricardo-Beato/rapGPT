Yeah, bitch, bitch (Lil Boat), bitch
Lil Boat, bitch (Abso-lutely), bitch, bitch
Yeah you, yeah you, yeah you

Stunt or get stunted on
Young nigga never got fronted on
Bet that lil bitch gon' sing every song
Bet that lil bitch coming right up out her thong
Bet that lil- uh-uh, damn
Stunt or get stunted on
Young nigga never been fronted on
Bet that lil bitch gon' sing every song (skrrt)
Bet that lil bitch coming right up out her thong (skrrt)

Yeah, woah, damn, damn
They do it all on the camera phone
Never discriminate on skin tone
Chopper gon' sing like a Kem song
Can't fuck around with these ding dongs
I need like 10 for a sing along (hah!)
She sing along while she finger bang
Banana clip for Orangutan
Monkey ass nigga tried to take my figures
That shit an issue, we gon' rip his tissue
You might also like
Yeah, you
Dipset (skrrt), young nigga Dipset (young nigga Dipset)
Stunt or get stunted on (get stunted on)
Young nigga never been fronted on (never been fronted on)
Bet that lil bitch gon' sing every song (every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her thong (gon' sing every song)
Bet that lil bitch sing us every song (she gon' sing every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her tho-o-ong
Dipset (Dipset), young nigga Dipset (young nigga Dipset)
Stunt or get stunted on (get stunted on)
Young nigga never been fronted on (young nigga never been-)
Bet that lil bitch gon' sing every song (every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her thong (hoo! oh-no-no)
Bet that lil bitch sing us every song (hoo-ouu! every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her thong-ong-ong (Offset!)

The bitch got good brain, she got a doctorate
Lookin' down, my diamonds hangin' on me like an ornament
Remember when niggas they left me behind like an orphanage
They didn't want to open doors so we had to kick it in
Ridin' round in a coupe with no ceilin' in
Got your bitch and she suckin' on my dick again
Bakin' soda with the coca, we gon' mix it in
These fuck nigga really sweet like some cinnamon
Had a mili, lost a mili, got it back
Your bitch ran off, where she goin'? Where she at?
A cappella freedom, oh the fans singin' that
I am not the same
Drop the top, on no lamborghini brain
Fuckin' these bitches, I'm fuckin' up these bitches' brain
Diamonds hittin' like Jackie Chain
Yeah, I'm a rock star, I don't care and I pop my shit like Ric Flair
Long money I got stocks and shares
I'm fuckin' with the pretty women
Ridin' round with a life sentence
Same chopper but we got two different clippings
Young nigga, we gon' take it to the 9th innin'
After we done we gon' go and put a knife in it
Yeah, you
Dipset (skrrt), young nigga Dipset (young nigga Dipset)
Stunt or get stunted on (get stunted on)
Young nigga never been fronted on (never been fronted on)
Bet that lil bitch gon' sing every song (every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her thong (gon' sing every song)
Bet that lil bitch sing us every song (she gon' sing every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her thong (oh-oh-oh)
Dipset (Dipset), young nigga Dipset (young nigga Dipset)
Stunt or get stunted on (get stunted on)
Young nigga never been fronted on (young nigga never been-)
Bet that lil bitch gon' sing every song (every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her thong (no-no-no)
Bet that lil bitch sing us every song (every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her thong-ong-ong (gang)8Embed
