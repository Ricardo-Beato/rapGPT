8 ContributorsWorld Look At Me Lyrics
I used to have big dreams, go international
But that was just me being dumb, so irrational
I'm radical, I’m lazy, I need to practice more
And why everybody want to be rapping for
And just plain disrespecting the art
I recollect from my heart, guess that's what sets me in part
Still wondering why no labels try to sign me yet
And my rap, reject, for real, I want the respect
And to be next, but I'ma get it and earn it
I can admit that I’m learning, but I'm legit, I deserve it
Now that's just me being optimistic, I want it, I gotta get it
And the doubters that tell me no, they can't stop the vision
And put a sock in it, and stuff it down their esophagus
Swallow it until your screaming out "Yahweh" like you 
Intolerant of critics
But if you ain't putting in the work, you wouldn't get it, admit it
Imagine if you were spitting fire like a dragon or as fly as Aladdin
But every time when you rapping, man they say you're wack man
I swear they can't stand me, I do it for family
But I’ll remember my haters when I’m winning the Grammy

See I'ma make it, that’s a guarantee
See me flying in the crowds, world, look at me
World, look at me
World, look at me
Whoever said sky's the limit is an underachiever
Now we're flying off to Venus, without the Serena
Without the Serena
Without the...
You might also like
In these songs, I put my heart and my soul
It all start with a goal, I got the sharpest of flows
Increase your interest in music, it's worth listening to it
And Nas is my biggest influence
Making rigorous music
Tryna bring rap back to it’s regular days
It's never the same, since the '90's, it's changed
For better or for worse, forever, I'm cursed
With this gift to write rhymes without effort or work
Reading a veteran verse
But you just gotta put the work in or you're just worthless
And you gotta have the courage to spit the verses
And it also take perseverance
And when they say it isn't worth the hearing, it just hurt the spirit

See I'ma make it, that's a guarantee
See me flying in the crowds, world, look at me
World look at me
World look at me
Whoever said sky's the limit is an underachiever
Now we're flying off to Venus, without the Serena
Without the Serena
Without the...
If Martin Luther had a dream, then I'ma spark the vision
And you could understand more, if you start to listen
Well that's a smart decision
No need to start a lecture
They say your rhymes are foreign, preface this like architecture
Others say I suck, like are you serious
Mr. Psycho flows, I'm better than you period
Are you delirious, curious, how he get this good
Well you can have some more rhymes, now I wish you would
And it's amazing how he switch his flow and style up
Now hopefully, he haters don't let the money pile up
They can't fit and make the Nile flood
And before, we make the crowd nuts but

See I'ma make it, that's a guarantee
See me flying in the crowds, world, look at me
World look at me
World look at me
Whoever said sky's the limit is an underachiever
Now we're flying off to Venus, without the Serena
Without the Serena
