54 ContributorsCatacomb Kids Lyrics
I was a dark, dumb student, no hooky rookie
Day tripping on visions of chickens that looked like R. Crumb drew 'em
They grew him in the royal dirt of Suffolk County's flooring
With the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms
Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles
Fit into the aforementioned or slip through the pinholes
'Zook' slip through the pinholes, crispy the godsender
Who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender (What's this?)
Broke the formal squad sensor, root down
Feelers out across the marsh before it was 'awesome cars'
My calling card cavalry cook in a '85 Dodge Ares
Gas for Huntington and back barely
Equipped with super soakers full of piss
And an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit
The kid pilot his ring king dummies to King Kullen
Where he hollered 'fuck the world' from a parking lot in the suburbs
What's this?
A couple spray cans and a little litter
But they'd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters
So fuck ;em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
Believe, or be there when it happens
The shaking of the plates off the mantle
The snaking of the flames off the candle
The lady of the lake off the answers
The mating of mistakes 'til they're de-planting cadavers
Now it's rest in peace Lou Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to
Further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency
Damn doggy, good times, thanks
I wrote your name in wet cement by the Brooklyn Banks

I'm an activator
Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later
Catacomb kids cuddle a fantastic labor
When the towns speed freaks sleep
Trap the traitor, he will ask for papers
What's this
Say I'm an activator
Made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag per acre
By the snotty little muzzle of a latch-key neighbor
When the folk push aggie over some dap with gators
He will catch the vapors

A couple Playboy mud-flaps and hell on his heels
Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shovel his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
So dinner split a lima bean in triplets, pick a winner
It took a couple summers puking pills behind the dumpster
As the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers
One shoe in a soupy gutter, one shoe in a velvet heaven
Where the mermaids harlem shake up out a lake of melted weapons
What's this?
Dance purty with the hooligan nation
Who are impatiently awaiting zoo-keeper facelift
Extra the days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit
We've merely updated the ancient 8-bit
Yeah I'm dumber than a cow on a roof in a flood
Who's not as dumb as the watered-down beef from the burgers that jumped
I'm dumber than a Taz on a beach chair with a martini
Who's not as dumb as the tat wit the same scenery
What's this
Sparky nails pigs, stigmata for all good sport
Garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court
And chase cheese fries with Binaca
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem, we responded like a snow day
And would clobber shit to flotsam, 'til the cop said it was okay
Okay show the squadrons back into their boxes
Like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
And I walk into the office, coughing awful ether often
Flaunt a parking meter fever, knuckle up for Love and Rockets
It was rain of the razor laser, day of the cloudy howdy
Flight of the shelter melter, you can bow without me
(What's this?)
I'm an activator
Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later
Catacomb kids cuddle a fantastic labor
When the towns speed freaks sleep
Trap the traitor, he will ask for papers
What's this
Say I'm an activator
Made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag per acre
By the snotty little muzzle of a latch-key neighbor
When the folk push aggie over some dap with gators
He will catch the vapors

Watch me jump
What's this
Knock em out the box, Aes5Embed
