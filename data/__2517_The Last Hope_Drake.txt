21 ContributorsThe Last Hope Lyrics
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall
You might also like
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope5Embed
