22 ContributorsWhat They Gonna Do Lyrics
Yeah (Yo yo yo)
Haha, yeah (Yo yo yo)
Yeah (Yo yo yo)
Show out her wild side, push out her backside (Hov!)

If you with us, throw the diamond up one time (Yo yo yo)
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Yo yo yo)
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind (Yo yo yo)
And make her (Show out her wild side, push out her backside)

What the fuck they gon' do with me?
Got money, got broads, got a crew with me
Gorillas, banana clips, I got a zoo with me
Get down or lay down nigga to shoot with me
Now how the fuck they gon' deal with me?
I ain't going nowhere, they gotta deal with me
Got the whole BK ready to kill with me
You scared motherfucker? Keep it real with me
Keep it real with me
Now what the fuck they gon say to me? Got to clap, yi mean?
All day with me, clap, yi mean?
Don't play with me, clap, yi mean?
Stay with me, don't lose me y'all
And please don't confuse me with dawg, I'm different
I bought it back for a living
Thirty-three O's on a chick back like Pippen
Three she can keep for herself and distribute
Thirty-six O's in a ki, you do the addition
Before Mitchell and Ness did it
I was moving birds like a Oriole fitted
I'm Cal Ripken Jr., let's get it
You might also like
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time (Yo yo yo)
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Yo yo yo)
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind (Yo yo yo)
And make her (Show out her wild side, push out her backside)
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time (Yo yo yo)
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Yo yo yo)
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind (Yo yo yo)
And make her (Show out her wild side, push out her backside)

Honey, what they gon' say to you?
Got your hair did and your favorite shoes
Tell 'em don't play with you
Get 'em away from you, you need a baller like I
Call 'em like I, see 'em like, "Nah"
Move over, y'all amateurs
No, you not balling, that's Pro-Am shit
Oh, stop calling that's ho man shit
Stop falling asleep, that's old man shit
I stands up in it like a champ up in it
Be up in it so long, get my calls transferred in it
No more minute man in it
Get my Soundscan, BDS and Market at Glance in it

If you with us, throw the diamond up one time (Yo yo yo)
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Yo yo yo)
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind (Yo yo yo)
And make her (Show out her wild side, push out her backside)
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time (Yo yo yo)
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Yo yo yo)
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind (Yo yo yo)
And make her (Show out her wild side, push out her backside)
(What y'all gon do?) You got starch in your flow
I flow too many ways, got a arch in my flow, all sorts of flow
Rembrandt, Rilke, I am art with the flow
Even if I'm guilty, you gotta pardon the flow
Niggas taking it lightly, had to darken the flow
Way I put it together, tear 'em apart with the flow
I'm too smart with the flow, you just started the flow
Stop it youngin, you 106 & Park with the flow
I am pro, as you see, I'm off the charts with the flow
Actually I'm number one on the charts with the flow
In some places they say this, I am God with the flow
Like my office but they're biased, too involved with the flow
Although I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow
Troubled man, dare I say, I am Mar' with the flow
I come up hard but I evolve with the flow
Crossover, slam dunk, Rucker Park with the flow, let's go

If you with us, throw the diamond up one time (Yo yo yo)
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Yo yo yo)
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind (Yo yo yo)
And make her (Show out her wild side, push out her backside)
If you with us, throw the diamond up one time (Yo yo yo)
Ladies, if you with us, just grind to the bassline (Yo yo yo)
Homie, don't be scared to grab her from behind (Yo yo yo)
And make her (Show out her wild side, push out her backside)
Yes (Woo) yes (Woo, yo, yo yo yo)
Yes (Woo) yes (Woo, yo yo, yo yo yo)
Yes (Woo) yes (Woo, haha, yo yo yo)
Yes (Bum bum)

Yo yo yo, yo yo yo, yo yo yo
Yo yo yo, yo yo yo, yo yo yo
Oh, oh, oh, yo
Yo yo yo, yo yo yo, yo yo yo
I need a girl right now, yo, I need a girl right now, yo
Yo yo yo, yo yo yo, yo yo yo
I need a girl right now, yo, can I see your backside? Yo
Yo yo yo, yo yo yo, yo yo yo
I need a girl right now, yo, can I see your backside? Yo
I need a girl right now, yo, can I see your backside? Yo
Yo, yo1Embed
