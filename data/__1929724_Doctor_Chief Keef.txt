Chopsquad
Glo Gang (Gang in this bitch, man)
Aye (Know how we rockin' like cut off stockings, man, keep kush in my pocket, man, you I'm talm' 'bout)
Terintino (Almighty Glo Man) (Gang, gang)
Almighty Glo Man, you already know how I'm rocking (Gang in this bitch)
Send a nigga to the doctor
Still the same young nigga, man, nothing changed, nigga (Bang, bang)
Blocka, blocka, blocka (Bang, bang)
'Cause I got a lil change, nigga, whassup, bang, nigga
Ayy

Went and got me a chopper
Just to send a nigga to the doctor
His hoe called me, said she need a doctor
I said baby I fix bitches, that's no problem
Would you write me if I was locked up?
Would you like me if I wasn't guaped up?
Balenciagas, I don't wear no Prada (hell nah)
Straight hundreds, I don't take no dollars (hell nah)

5 thousand, turn 'em into dollars (5 bands)
In the strip clubs, throw 'em, make 'em holler (Yeah man)
I took 50,000 dollars down to Johnny Dang
But I had to make sure my Grandma', my ma' rent paid
'Member playin' cops and robbers
Niggas was cops, I was robbin'
Just seen a car, finna cop it
And how dare a nigga tell me that I'm not, bitch
Baby like why he be on that hot shit?
Boy fuck that hot shit, fuck that hot shit
If it's that guap shit I be on that, I be on that
Lonely at the top, I ain't going back

Went and got me a chopper
Just to send a nigga to the doctor
This ho called me, said she need a doctor
I said baby I fix bitches, that's no problem
Would you write me if I was locked up?
Would you like me if I wasn't guaped up?
Balenciagas, I don't wear no Prada (hell nah)
Straight hundreds, I don't take no dollars (hell nah)

Went and got me some guap
'Member when I ain't had none
Went and got me some Baleinciagas
Cause I remembered that's what I wanted
Ridin' in anything I want
And I fuck any thot I want bitch
I be gettin' money, gettin' money
And I be spendin' money, spendin' money
Pull up, sku sku sku, better cuff your honey
If you want her cause I know she love money
And that money shit ain't funny
I always be gettin' money

Went and got me a chopper
Just to send a nigga to the doctor
This ho called me, said she need a doctor
I said baby I fix bitches, that's no problem
