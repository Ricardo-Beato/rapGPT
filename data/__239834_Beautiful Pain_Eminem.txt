I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today's a painful re-
Minder of why
It can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the
Inside lookin' out, ‘cause—

I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake
To start the mourning process and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it and poked its
Eye out with the thornbush that ya used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back
May hit the curb, but every day's a new learning curve as ya
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chantin'
You might also like
I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died, 'cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you've been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down, ‘cause you're so over 'em
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal but scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
Perspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief, it's like watching the walls melt
In your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream—

I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I feel the burn
Watch the smoke as I turn, rising
A phoenix from the flames
I have learned
From fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists
But with wings that I will fly
And I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light239Embed
