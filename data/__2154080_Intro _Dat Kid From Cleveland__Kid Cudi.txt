15 ContributorsIntro (Dat Kid From Cleveland) Lyrics
Hey, he's a man
He's a short man, the shortest man you'll see
It's DJ E-V, he's the shortest man you'll see
Rolling with the K-I-D C-U-D-I
It's DJ E-V, he's the shortest DJ you'll see
Hey!
Yo, uhm, holla at me my nigga, haha
We doing it big
We not playing games, Kid Cud
I love everybody
I love the hate
I love the positive
I love everything man
Show me love when you meet, when you see me
