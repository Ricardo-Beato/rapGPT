Wheezy Beatz
I was riding on a bike
On a very late night
She give me chills, I'm for real (Hey!)

I'm the one with soul, and I know your role
A real one for sure (For sure)
I won't fill your coke, I won't fill lipo
I won't no, no, no

Oh yeah yeah, look, oh yeah yeah, oh
Oh yeah yeah, oh
Look at that stare right there, that stare right there
That stare right there, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah (Oh, oh)

If I stunt on them niggas you don't (What?)
I'll walk that street (Walk that street)
Next to my bike (Yeah)
Child on the front
Child on the bike like we livin' overseas (Yeah)
I had a dream these niggas stood over me (And what?)
I had a bad bitch, and she ate it off a cake (Bitch, you geeked)
Drunk off your love and I just stood by the sink (Blegh)
Look in these eyes, they disguise you to me (What?)
I just popped like rubber bands on it (Rubber, roll it)
Her booty fly like L.A., I just land on it (Yeah)
Yeah, top notch saran on it (Yeah)
Yeah, baby tell me where we stand (Yeah)
Her booty big as a sedan, I'm like
You might also like
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Look at that stare right there, that stare right there
That stare there, yeah, yeah (Look at it)
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah (Sing)
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah (Oh)

Now I be cruisin' to Lil Uzi (Thugger)
Talking shit, so pass the toothpaste
Leave that to them, ain't nothin' to do with it (Ah)
I want head like due date, yeah
I remember you popped your first bottle (I remember)
I remember I had my first toddler (What?)
Nothin' changed, I remember I had my third toddler (And what?)
Yeah lil' Wanda, she was my syrup partner (Lean, lean)
Free lil' Unfoonk, he got an Earth doctor (Free my brother)
I ranned off on some of my cursed doctors (Hah)
Dropped the racks right on 'em like a girl got 'em
I'm just in it, bae, this your world, yeah yeah
And if you like 'em, then I love 'em, they deserve partners (Hah)
You left a bag for me to seeâ€“e (You did)
You left a bag and now you hurt me
I only helped you pack your bag because you irk me (Swea)
Do it hurt when you gone? I'm like
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Look at that stare right there, that stare right there (Look at it)
That stare right there, yeah, yeah (Look at it)
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah (Sing)
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Fuck 'em all and fuck what they thinkin'
First it wet then it multiply, yeah
You still piped, you ain't take it down, yeah
Mekhi Phifer, it's goin' down, yeah yeah
Bae you know that it's goin' down
I'm they ticket, they hold me down
And I'm so in love with the town
Much respect when you come around
