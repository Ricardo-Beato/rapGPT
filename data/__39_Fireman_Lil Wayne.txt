Fresh on campus, it's the Birdman Junior (Yeah)
Money too long, teachers, put away your rulers (Yeah)
Raw Tune, not a cartoon (Ayy)
No shirt, tattoos, and some war wounds (Sexy)
I'm hot, but the car cool
She wet, that's a car-pool
Been in that water since a youngin, you just shark food (Yum, yum)
Quick Draw McGraw, I went to art school (Hah)
Yeah, the lights is bright, but I got a short fuse (Woah)
Don't snooze (No)
Been handlin' the game so long, my thumbs bruised
Your new girlfriend is old news
You ain't got enough green and she so blue, yeah (Aww)
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true (Yes)
Everything is easy, baby, leave it up to Weezy Baby
Put it in the pot, let it steam, let it brew (Yes)
Now, watch me melt, don't burn yourself, 'cause

Yeah, riding by myself, well, really, not really (Well)
So heavy in the trunk, make the car pop a wheelie
Who? Weezy Baby, or call me Young Baby (Yeah)
My money three-sixty, you only one-eighty (That's right)
Half of the game too lazy (Yeah)
Still sleeping on me, but I'm 'bout to wake 'em, yep
I'm 'bout to take 'em to New Orleans and bake 'em (Woah)
Yeah, it's hot down here, take a walk with Satan, yeah (Hot)
Come on mama, let the Carter make you (Yeah)
Toss you like a fruit salad, strawberry grape you (Yeah)
They ball when they can and I'm ballin' by nature (Yeah)
Addicted to the game like Jordan and Payton (Come on)
Y'all in the race and me, I'm at the finish line (Uh-huh)
Been runnin' for too long, it's time to give me mine (Uh-huh)
Straight down your chimney, in your living room, it's I (Who?)
Weezy, allergic to wintertime, hot

I'm the fireman (Yeah), fire, f-fireman (Yeah)
I got that fire, I'm hollering (Yeah)
I got that fire, come and try me, and (Yeah)
