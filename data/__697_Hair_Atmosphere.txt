28 ContributorsHair Lyrics
And she still wonders why I'm so insecure
She giggles because I sleep with a-
Could I throw my panties on stage?
Like, can I be a fuckin' groupie and just fuck you cause
You're on stage and other girls want to fuck you?
See bands like us don't get groupies
Nawww
Yeaaahh
You're so full of shit, I'm sure you guys have-
No, it's not full of shit, I mean, have you ever heard our songs?
I mean, basically, exactly, that's what I'm sayin'

Smile, smile with me, smile with me, smile with me
Please won't you smile, smile with me, smile with me
Smile with me, please won't you

Oh look at her, she's lookin' as good as dinner
And she's lookin' back at me as if maybe I'm a winner
I'm in my late twenties little girl don't flirt with me
I've got the capabilities to program your circuitry
You don't have to believe, do yourself a little justice
Don't let Slug undercook your muffins
Oh wait, did I say that, I did, must be losing it
Cause it almost felt that it might just have some truth in it
Now back to the platter at hand
She said she's twenty-one and quit school to go work for the man
A switch up in the plan, now she's happy as a chorus
'Cause now she makes rent and now she drives a Taurus
Unwindin' and hangin' out at the bar
I wonder if she knows that I'm not really a star
She seems to be impressed with my lack of an ego and
My self-aware style, I like the way that she smiles
She wanna know how I find the words I use
I don't really know but I can lie if you want me to
Angels sing to me in my sleep
I sold my damaged soul for the magic of speak
Now she's laughin', she likes the sarcasm
Naturally, I'm askin' if she's got a captain
A captain, you mean a man at home, the answer is no
I came to this bar alone
Well heavens to Betsy, enough about boyfriends already
Just tryin' to keep the conversation heady
As much as I would love to run and play in the forest
Ain't no way this girl is gonna break into my fortress
I've never made a practice, of introducing the mattress
To women that I meet at my own gig
I don't know, can't imagine anything as small as
Alcohol and hormones turnin' out to be anything big
Baby's hella beautiful, even kinda bright
I've got the fire of a vampire inside me tonight
It might be alright, everything seems tight
I've got a good buzz and she's givin' me the green light
So tell me girl, what you doin' after
She says hopefully hangin' out with my new favorite rapper
Now wait a minute, that's not fair, you're throwin' 'boulders
I can tell by the way your hair touches your shoulders
Be straight with me and I'll be me with you
I can think of some of us that we should do
So if you think I'm comin' home with you tonight
You're probably right, probably right
A few more beers, a couple more laughs
Undressing my past with the questions she asked
Yes, I love cats and I would love to take a bath
If I would spend the night, would you massage my back
She's closin' in for the embrace
And slightly tucks her head under my face
Her hair smells so good, I gotta have a taste
Where's your Ford, let's ditch this place
In the parking lot, she sparked it off
She must be starving for someone to hit the heart
I've never been kissed with such passionate bliss
Pornstar damn near tore my lips apart
Honey, slow it up, hold it up, start the car and
Leave this garage, let's go to your apartment
Lyndale Avenue, on the way to her rest
Her drunk-ass turns to look at me and she says
You're so beautiful from the hair to the soul
I can't believe that I've never met you before
It feels like I've been waiting for you my whole life
She missed the red light, hit a pickup truck and we both diedYou might also like3Embed
