I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga

Young five-eight talk like he ten feet tall
Chopper make a nigga jump a ten foot wall
Avión and gold bottles, this is hood royalty
No matter how broke, how rich
Nigga, never ever compromise your loyalty
Medusa head on my Versace robe
Standing on a pile of white bricks
Imagine crosses on the units
Stamps looking like a crucifix
Pure like the blood of Virgin Mary
Turn water to some wine, nigga
Plug did a touchdown
Met him at the Steak 'n Shake in Mt. Zion, nigga

I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga

Young five-eight talk like he ten feet tall
Chopper make a nigga jump a ten foot wall
God shit, I'm on my Kanye
Bad bitch she my Kim K
Legend is that he made a million dollars
But the nigga really started with a four-way
Whom shall I fear, nigga
The plug say it's no limits
I sent the man right here, nigga
Snatch a partner out the state pen
Hallejulah, amen
Pull a little water from the sink
Hope it wash away the sin, nigga
The foe did a touchdown
Met him at the Chanterelle’s in West End, nigga

I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga
I'm a god in the hood, nigga

Young five-eight talk like he ten feet tall
Chopper make a nigga jump a ten foot wall
Young five-eight talk like he ten foot tall
Chopper make a nigga jump a ten foot wall9Embed
