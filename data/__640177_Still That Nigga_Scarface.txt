5 ContributorsStill That Nigga Lyrics
Gunshots rain from a drop-top tray
Hit my little partner in his chest and there he lay
I never held a hand of a dead man never
And took a tragic death to bring the family together
So now we have to get the motherfucker and his friends
'Cause niggas in my family are all about revenge
It's all about respect, retaliation on the villain
The minute I spot the nigga close your eyes 'cause I'ma kill him
Nobody said a word everybody grab their strap
And headed for the property to peel these niggas caps
We roll for an hour before we caught up with the bitch
Turning down my music, I started cocking up my shit
Hydraulics fully juiced, so my shit was riding hot
Peeped along the side and laid the shot through the driver's side
Swerving to the left, I figured he was hurt
Put my shit is neutral drop my 'draulics in the dirt
Creeped back around in the dirt riding forward
Let my partners out so they can get up with his dogs
Making sure that everybody's heads roll with this
Before we charge the pistol we rock them clean of all the fingerprints
Niggas think the rap game changed my name it's still the same
And the fact remains motherfucker

I'm still that nigga
I'm still that nigga
Nigga
I'm still that nigga

I heard somebody pull a jack at Mickey D's
Fucked him out his paper, fucked him out his 2 keys
School motherfucker set him up for the jack
Out of 36 ounces, he may have got a quarter back
Risking his fucking life, let alone getting time
The going time for dimes they offer niggas close to 99
Might as well accept it, stuck nigga you stuck
Nigga seem to make a habit outta getting people fucked
I just can't understand it, niggas getting took for
Every fucking quarter that they ever fucking worked for
A bad moon's arising and everyone's upset
He came up short on his hands and now he's vexed
He owes a bunch of money and niggas want their shit
Ain't nothing left to do but go for broke in this bitch
You're Tony Montana, you don't give a fuck bro
Spotted that nigga, rolling thick so you stuck yo
Nose in his business and met up with the chrome trigger
Holler at the motherfucker gravedigger bitch

'Cause I'm that nigga
(Damn that shit smooth huh)
Nigga
(That's some of that, that's some of that that face beating down that block you know what I'm saying
Hey yo shit sound like it's here)
Nigga
Click click bang bang lay it down you're dead
'Cause niggas were never able to take to the head
It's hard to explain how it is when it's on
But rule number 1 is get your shit and get it going
Shooting up the enemy, making niggas hate ya
Straight shot haters, motherfuckers came to break ya
Niggas I thought you knew I cut that ass up like a butcher
And only have you seen me fires is where I put ya
I used to pack a pistol, but Uzis do it better though
1993  comin' Federal
Fuck it if I fall then I fall with my head hot
Living for my family once I see my partner toast died
Let a nigga know that they be playing this shit for real
And living in the 90s you either kill or either get killed
Somebody said there ain't no love and I can see it
So if there's gonna be war then bring it on because I'm heated
These niggas fighting fire with fire so bring your hardhat
AK-47 to your face now where your card at
Hoes usually got em, it ain't no doubt just pull it out
Better yet relax yourself motherfuckers 'cause I'ma blow it out
After 1 or 2 reps your shit sounds tired bitch
I'm on my sixth album and still kickin the fire shit
205 and I'm steady getting big
You better ask somebody you stupid bitch
'Cause I'm that nigga
(Hey, yeah)
I'm that nigga
(You ain't know? Mike D you ain't know?)
Still that nigga2Embed
