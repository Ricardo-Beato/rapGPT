30 ContributorsRocket Ship Lyrics
Drankin' lean, totin' extendos
Phantom long like a limo
(ATL Jacob)
I've been poppin' since my demo
I've been poppin' since my demo, bitch

I've been poppin' since my demo, bitch, yeah
Bust the bales down in the kitchen, bitch, yeah
Cookin' coke up, water whip that shit, yeah
Pull the boat up, we want all the bricks, yeah
Call your ho up, she take all the dick, yeah
I took four, I'm feelin' like a rocket ship, yeah
Ice on both arms, got me in galaxy, yeah
Louis V throw-on, got me arrogant, yeah

We had them chickens filled up in the Dually, I'm tellin' you, you can ask Chuck if he call
I had the pounds, the pills, whatever you wanted, we puttin' a cut on the dog
I went to space and ain't ever gon' come back to Earth, they gonna throw a lil' salt
You chargin' 4K for Actavis, dawg, it's good, you need to bring it all
Police done stopped comin' through Lil Mexico 'cause we made the laws
Soon as I got my first check I was crooked, so I had paid 'em off
Soon as they get word a nigga snitchin', they gotta knock him off
Soon as we get them birds, we go tweakin', then we go ship 'em off

I've been poppin' since my demo, bitch, yeah
Bust the bales down in the kitchen, bitch, yeah
Cookin' coke up, water whip that shit, yeah
Pull the boat up, we want all the bricks, yeah
Call your ho up, she take all the dick, yeah
I took four, I'm feelin' like a rocket ship, yeah
Ice on both arms, got me in galaxy, yeah
Louis V throw-on, got me arrogant, yeah

We had them chickens filled up in the Dually, I'm tellin' you, you can ask Chuck if he call
I-I-I had the pounds, the pills, whatever you wanted, we puttin' a cut on the dog
I've been poppin' since my demo, bitch, yeah3Embed
