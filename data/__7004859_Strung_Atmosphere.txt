5 ContributorsStrung Lyrics
How does it go? I'm all strung out
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out
Already know, I'm all strung out
I'm lost in the cloud of fear and self-doubt
How does it go? I'm all strung out
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out
Already know, I'm all strung out
I'm tryna work it out, I think I'm burning out

Yes, the rebel, the rhythm
The devil in my system got me feeling like brrt, stick 'em
It's three in the morning and I'm standing in my kitchen
Opened up the fridge to confront my addictions
Looking at the food like it'll save me from my sickness
Maybe that's how it got the nicknames Fixins
I wanna make a sandwich and cop a couple donuts
A bowl of cereal and wash it down with a soda
But I'm getting too old to act young
In a culture of consumption, gotta fix thе malfunctions
Mix another drink so I can feel like a loser
If I stay away from liquor, I'm fiеnding for some sugar
Got a whole lot of excuses to change my behavior
So stressed out, I just wanna stay familiar
Man, I'm just a man tryna feed mi familia
Pancakes looking at me like I wanna kill ya

How does it go? I'm all strung out
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out
Already know, I'm all strung out
I'm lost in the cloud of fear and self-doubt
How does it go? I'm all strung out
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out
Already know, I'm all strung out
I'm tryna work it out, I think I'm burning out

Cheeseburgers and chicken wings
Got my t-shirts in the thick of things
Nachos and tacos put me in debacle
I could have that or the mac and cheese and pot roast
Knowing damn well I should follow Dr. Sebi
But I love to cake parmesan and meat on my spaghetti
Back in the day I could pack it away
And none of that garbage happened to stay
I went from high metabolism to bye, metabolism
Oh shit, I gotta find my activism
But I'm lacking interest
And that Big Mac is smacking, isn't it?
And when big mama's back in the kitchen
I start chasing my appetite like I'm tracking a distance
I gotta get back in business
Hello, Lifetime Fitness?
How does it go? I'm all strung out
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out
Already know, I'm all strung out
I'm lost in the cloud of fear and self-doubt
How does it go? I'm all strung out
I'm sick of this shit like it's about to turn me out
Already know, I'm all strung out
I'm tryna work it out, I think I'm burning out1Embed
