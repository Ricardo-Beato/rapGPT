And the CEO

Gucci Mane’s a G, G
I’m tryna sell a P, P’s
From A to Z (From A to Z)
You know about B
You know about B
You know I fuck with Wee (Longway)
It wouldn’t cost me but a G (Rack)
I leave blood on your tee (Huh)
I leave blood on the street (You)
I put mud on the street (Lean, lean, lean, lean, lean)
A pint will cost you 'bout a G (Codeine)
Don’t call it pint, just call it P (PT’s)
F on my rims, I’m in the D (I'm in Detroit)

Don’t F' around with him, got that F&N
I’m in that BMW and F is on my rims (Forgis)
Every trap from A to Z (Every trap from A to Z)
These white girls want that E (they want that E)
Hundred K for my SSMC (It's Monte Carlo, bitch)
I know the alphabet boys wanna see me (ATL)
Got that Cali' OG (the FBI)
My AR in close reach (It's Gucci)
You might also like
I do what I want, you do what you can
You a dope boy, I’m a dope man
Six-hundred horses in my V, sellin’ P
That bitch use to be thick until she started sniffing P
Streets love me but I’m hated by the M.P.D
Multimillion dreams but I have nightmares of the F-E-D's (God damn)
Lord please have mercy on me, I know I don't ‘posed to be dealin'
So after this pack I'm chillin'
Last eight summers I made me a killin’
OG PT’s made me addicted
Damn near OD'd and fucked up my kidneys
Almost let down the whole South Memphis
I'm in my trap house letting them things go for the wholesale
I'm on the West Coast, chillin' with 50 P's in my hotel

Don’t F' around with him, got that F&N
I’m in that BMW and F is on my rims (Forgis)
Every trap from A to Z (Every trap from A to Z)
These white girls want that E (they want that E)
Hundred K for my SSMC (It's Monte Carlo, bitch)
I know the alphabet boys wanna see me (ATL)
Got that Cali' OG (the FBI)
My AR in close reach (It's Gucci)
White hoes want that E, I told em I got molly
This AR laying next to me, can't wait to catch a body
Shoot from A to Z, I left  forensic ID
I fly out to D, I heard they serving, they got PT’s
Meet a bad bitch, look like RiRi
I’m crippin’, she rock CC
Chanel Chanel with Ceewee
I’m a D-boy, sell a nigga QP's
Guwop and Dolph still pouring out the PT
On the East Side sipping on lean, lean
In the HOV like Jay Z
Like JD, money ain’t a damn thing
H to the O, bring your main thing
These hoes on Longway's dang-dang
Balmain mix-matched with the Hermes
HK, don’t fuck with 
Double R, it's rolling 60's
Got OG, Longway hippie
F&N double down on me
Turn ya veggie, eating rice like a 

Don’t F' around with him, got that F&N
I’m in that BMW and F is on my rims (Forgis)
Every trap from A to Z (Every trap from A to Z)
These white girls want that E (they want that E)
Hundred K for my SSMC (It's Monte Carlo, bitch)
I know the alphabet boys wanna see me (ATL)
Got that Cali' OG (the FBI)
My AR in close reach (It's Gucci)Embed
