8 ContributorsLife So Hard Lyrics
You told me to give it up my nigga
Now you wanna' hop on the bus my nigga
You see me ballin' now you finna' rush my nigga
I'm feelin like Hammer, can't touch my nigga
Real niggas made the trap house bump my nigga
That's what I call Trap Funk my nigga
Looking like a young James Brown in the kitchen
We all like Bobby, everybody loves Whitney
Came in the game, can't trust these bitches
But everybody wanna' fall in love with these bitches
Run from on the north, take a hoe and make a million
Make a basic bitch feel like Hillary Clinton
Let's talk about the rapper swagger jagger niggas
Put the powder on my hand so I can smack a nigga
I had powder on my hand before the rapping nigga
On the north turned the bando to a mansion nigga
Million dollar cash in the duffel
Million dollar man got muscle
It's a whole pound in the plastic
Gotta' pay for fore' you snatch it
Grandmama died, momma cried a million times
Pistol Pete died, still cried a million times
Life paid off all these hard ass years
Money don't change, but the money change bills

Hey, it was so hard (life was so hard)
Damn, life was so hard (life was so hard)
It was so hard  (life was so hard)
Fuck, life was so hard (life was so hard)

Life was so hard I prayed to God
Shit weren't good everyday nigga I had it hard
Quit sprinting out the crib running from 12 dropping the cars
I have been through the jungle and forest, came out with no scar
Remember the day at momma house sleep
Quavo woke me up in my sleep
Had one Jordan on his feet
We tripping, looking out for the police
He said not only did I lose my shoe, lost my ID
Take you back about a year ago, trapping it at the bando
Way before niggas begin using the Migos flow
When my pockets was hurting I had to kick a door
Or found a way to get benjamins was the motto
I go to sleep, I was dreaming about hitting the lotto
Wake up in reality, he gotta get every dollar
You told me to give it up, but watch how you gone' follow
Niggas that talking they gone' holla
Brush the dirt off my collar
Get back to the guala
Yea niggas, still jugg season (you forgot)
Errbody' know we got no label (independent nigga)
We came in as young rich niggas
One man down but nobody can replace him (Offset)
I don't fear nobody, only my creator (God)
Ain't no pray to nobody only my savior
I don't fuck with none of you niggas cuz' you fugazy
Life's hard life is whatever you make it
Hey, it was so hard (life was so hard)
Damn, life was so hard (life was so hard)
It was so hard  (life was so hard)
Fuck, life was so hard (life was so hard)2Embed
