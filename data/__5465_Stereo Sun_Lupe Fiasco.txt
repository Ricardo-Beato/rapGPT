21 ContributorsStereo Sun Lyrics
It's the way of the stage
It's like a stereo sun
It's the way I build up, the business really gets done
It's like a stereo sun

I hear it: the spirit, and I don't fear it
Matter 'fact, I steer it
Right in the heart of the hardships, I don't veer it
And this car is just a metaphor for my experience
No registration or insurance, just a license to ill
God's hands on the wheel, and my pedal's to the ceilin', peelin'
Speeding like 24 frames through the lights
With the traffic cameras filmin, brights
So I could see the brilliance of this life I've been given
Livin' to start a revolution every minute
Driven to win it, no breaks, no pittin'
Pole position ya soul, keep ya windows tinted
So we can see out it, but they can't see in it
So this here's ours, and them theirs rented
Cars moving at top gear, Jeremy Clarkson
I feel like this my first track and I ain't even start nothin, yessir!

You might also like
The sky's on fire, the storm is almost near us
But that's when I'm the clearest, when things are the severest
I'll be here for its arrival and for its disappearance
Broadcasting live and clear, even with the interference
See this is what it sounds like when life becomes lyric
The best thing ever, you should really come and hear it
But if you can't, cool. We'll be coming to your nearest, soon
Shining like two suns, it's better than two thumbs
The whole plot's to get you
To stop from doing what you do, to do better than you've done
Then we'll stare down the feds in the room
Who dares not to scare? Hear it, boom!
Unaffected by your werewolves, ghosts and your 'boom'
The tour through the tombs don't do nothing to 'em, never!
I turn the pressure into treasure
My problem's in the present and my presence is forever
Yes, sir!
