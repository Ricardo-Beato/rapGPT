You're the type of girl I'd love to get to know
I don't hit the gym but I can hit your phone
I could touch your heart baby I can hit your soul
And if you like the way it sounds maybe you could go ahead and
Bounce that ass

Yeah I told her "bounce that ass"
Broke right now but I'm sittin' on a mound of cash
Ain't got it yet but soon I'll be countin' racks
Ima get this music movin' like an ounce of crack, no joke

They be gettin' buzzed off the e-cig
Faded from the swag and it only took 'em three hits
It ain't the sweet shit, I just let it rotate
Seen them tryna stunt but homie all that shit is opaque
Told me that I'm so gay
Oh no, no way
Oh well, go and ask your mom if I got no game
Cause truth be told, thirty five ain't truly old
All I know is every time I see 'em and that booty swole
She be like "Jack, how are things up in the studio?"
And I be like "Good, how are things up in that bootyhole?"
And she laughs like "oh my goodness you are such a silly goose"
Sorry that's your mom bro I'm just being real with you
Whole crew turnin', steering wheel turnin'
Ain't nobody worried 'bout what they gotta turn in
Designated driver and all I gots' a permit
It don't really matter though we keep that rubber burnin', uh
You might also like
Yeah I told her "bounce that ass"
Broke right now but I'm sittin' on a mound of cash
Ain't got it yet but soon I'll be countin' racks
Ima get this music movin' like an ounce of crack, no joke

The black girls yellin' "Ah, he's on butt!"
Pretty sure that that's ebonics for "Ah shucks, he's gone nuts"
You washed up, everything you did was all luck
Get crossed up, I'm so sick I'm nauseous
Number one rule is I ain't the one to fool with
Like my Dad says "I'm not interested in bullshit"
These rappers sound sweet and Ima top 'em off with cool whip
Got some friends in the east end loadin' full clips
I'm not 'bout it but they are
In the end I know that they got me like State Farm
I can hit 'em with a textbook, left hook
Knock 'em out cold so he wakes up with a fresh look, lets cook
Ima Heisenberger rhymin' words
Mighta heard that I'm a quiet nerd 'til I start to write a verse
It's time to work, put together a franchise
Started from the ground up now I'm a landslide
People don't like the way I'm spendin' my damn time
Guess that they don't know that my career is a landmine
Anti lame-o's with ant-sized bankrolls
Got the same love life as Manti Te'o
Ya'll been hatin' on me since the man was like a day old
Now I'm 'bout to blow up have the fans like ayo
I used to know him when he wasn't nearly that size
Never really thought it'd all materialize
Bounce that ass, yeah I told her "bounce that ass"
Broke right now but I'm sittin' on a mound of cash
Ain't got it yet but soon I'll be countin' racks
Ima get this music movin' like an ounce of crack, no jokeEmbed
