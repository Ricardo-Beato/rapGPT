Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)

Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is

Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists to non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leave
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!!)

Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand
In front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to question me
'Bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list
Peep this
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)22Embed
