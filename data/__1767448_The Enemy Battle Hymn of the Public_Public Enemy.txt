4 ContributorsThe Enemy Battle Hymn of the Public Lyrics
No election, remember that presidential selection
Got us in another erection of body parts
Dick, Bush, and Colin, tape is rollin'
New Whirl Odor flowin way past deodorant
Got the masses ignorant them dumb asses
The whirl surrenders to the way of the beltway
Created a war, Bin Laden found Saddam
Yo Griff, tell 'em what good is a goddamn bomb
I know they been lying about Bin Laden
Fight the power, but you don't know who hit them towers
And they dont care, Tony Blair
Ask the axis of hate, is the UK the 51st state?

Gettin the bomb shit
Ain't like gettin bombed and shit
Orders from your Commander-in-Thief
Head Chief, handkerchief
Ain't that right, Griff?
You gonna go in there
And take things and bomb things
2007 high tech thug gang
I rather be getting it than getting hit
Presidential orders from this New Whirl Odor
Stressin peoples of color across the water and the borders
People need food, education, employment
And damn that high tech equipment
You might also like
And the rhetoric from one sided poli-tricks
From a government on some old World War III trip
If I was there, I'd quit, go home and be getting it
Stick a Bush and dick in the world and watch it twirl
America's a dude and the Earth a girl
You gotta fight for your love, remain a cut above
The rest of the world don't matter
Sounds like propaganda
New facism on another channel
Turn offa that thing and see the sun
I'm a take my black ass home and get someoneEmbed
