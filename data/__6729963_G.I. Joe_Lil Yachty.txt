21 ContributorsG.I. Joe Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Buddah Bless this beat)
Yeah, uh, feel me, nah
Niggas gettin' money in this motherfucker, you feel me?
They'll never feel me, man
It's a million dollar circle, you feel me?
I'm the young nigga with two, three million
Million dollar niggas around me (Yeah, uh)
Everybody destined for greatness, you feel me? (Uh, uh)
Slatt, go, go, go, go, go, go (Uh, uh)

I'm the young nigga who got it
Pourin' a four in a two, I ain't modest
I cannot move 'til I see a deposit
Feelin' 'em pinks and blue in my pocket
Fuck what he sayin', you know that it's up
Fuckin' on twins, geeked and stuck
I'm in a Benz, pushin' the pedal
New FN, ain't no metal
Pray for sins, I might move wrong
Bro off them tens, head in the clouds
Fuckin' this bitch that I saw in the crowd
Told her shut up, she screamin' too loud
Bitch ass nigga, I told you so
Nigga get mad, I fold his ho
Big AKs like G.I. Joe
Niggas be fake like CGI
You might also like
Bitch west coast like TDE
Tote that stick, oh, you ain't know?
Ask 'bout Boat, know he ain't ho
He on go, pourin' fours
Yeah, bought about four or five Benzes
I got the tent, I crashed the Bent'
I got the bitch in the back gettin' bent
Outside in the back of the crib in a tent
Slatt, huh, I got a four-pack, huh
I had to fold the MAC
Drivin' this shit off the track, huh
Yeah, move with them boys, live
Free all my niggas who bangin' the fire'
Jump in the water head first, I dive (Go)

I'm the young nigga who got it
Pourin' a four in a two, I ain't modest
I cannot move 'til I see a deposit
Feelin' 'em pinks and blue in my pocket
Fuck what he sayin', you know that it's up
Fuckin' on twins, geeked and stuck
I'm in a Benz, pushin' the pedal
New FN, ain't no metal
Pray for sins, I might move wrong
Bro off them tens, head in the clouds
Fuckin' this bitch that I saw in the crowd
Told her shut up, she screamin' too loud
Bitch ass nigga, I told you so
Nigga get mad, I fold his ho
Big AKs like G.I. Joe
Niggas be fake like CGI
Most niggas bootleg like DVDs
They want smoke, that's CBD
Twenty a verse
Gotta get twenty a verse 'cause I blow twenty on lean
Okay, this shit in my genes
And just in my parents, that's how I was bred
I know some niggas that's dead
I'm focused on money, I'm blowin' her head
Okay, she givin' me head
Nigga, this head on the edge of the bed
Okay, I'm high off the Percs
Could've been Nicki, I left her on read
Okay, I'm keepin' it hood
Hat just sittin' on the side of my head
I got a hundred in cash
You know I got burners on side of the bed (Bah)

I'm the young nigga who got it
Pourin' a four in a two, I ain't modest
I cannot move 'til I see a deposit
Feelin' 'em pinks and blue in my pocket
Fuck what he sayin', you know that it's up
Fuckin' on twins, geeked and stuck
I'm in a Benz, pushin' the pedal
New FN, ain't no metal
Pray for sins, I might move wrong
Bro off them tens, head in the clouds
Fuckin' this bitch that I saw in the crowd
Told her shut up, she screamin' too loud
Bitch ass nigga, I told you so
Nigga get mad, I fold his ho
Big AKs like G.I. Joe
Niggas be fake like CGI1Embed
