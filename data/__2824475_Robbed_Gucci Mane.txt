(Zaytoven)

I reminisce about the day I got robbed (Got robbed, huh? Huh?)
Ain't ashamed to say I got robbed (Got robbed, huh? Huh?)
It's a beautiful day, someone gon' get robbed (Got robbed, yeah, yeah)
They ridin' 'round lookin' for people to rob (Got robbed, work it)
I reminisce about the day I got robbed (Got robbed, grrah, pow)
Ain't ashamed to say I got robbed (Got robbed, yeah, yeah)
It's a beautiful day, someone gon' get robbed (Got robbed, yeah)
They ridin' 'round lookin' for people to rob (Rob)

I still think about the day that I was robbed
Young and invincible, I thought that I was hard
But ain't no games gettin' played in Mountain Park (Nope)
That shit get ugly down there like Bubba Sparxxx
They'll take the food off your plate and you will starve (You will starve)
In East Atlanta, even robbers gettin' robbed (Huh?)
Them niggas hungry and they need a meal card
They make a kingpin get a real job (Yeah)
I done robbed niggas, I done got robbed (Yeah)
I done sold soft, and I done sold hard (Yeah)
I done got away, and I done got caught (Got caught)
So if I'm crazy, then it ain't my fault (Huh? Robbed)

I remember when I hit my first lick (First lick)
Door came off with the first kick (First kick)
I had a chick named Angel, so thick
She watched me come up from a crumb to a brick (Skrrt)
I know that karma is a bitch, real shit (Huh? Real shit)
But I don't rob one nigga, I rob cliques
The niggas I came up with got no sense (No sense)
Break in your house, ask them, they don't know shit (No)
They snatch you up and make you call your folks
And tell 'em go and get all your dough
Don't bring 'em to 'em, then your throat slit (Slit)
Man, I ain't playin' no games, my four slick (Huh?)
