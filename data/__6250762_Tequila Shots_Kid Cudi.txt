Duh-duh-duh, duh, duh, duh
As he falls back deeper, into a state
The return (Dot Da Genius, baby)
(Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Nights my mind is speedin' by, I'm holdin' on
Askin' God to help 'em, are you hearin' me?
Girl is tellin' me she don't know what she want
Lotta demons creepin' up, they're livin' underneath
Gotta take a minute, y'all, traveled far
Feelin' somethin', no, I can't ignore my instincts
Back just where I started, it's the same old damaged song
It's the shit I need

Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Hm, talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't losе, I'm in the third act
Lord seein' me swervе
Do this to my loved ones, I've got some nerve
Don't think I'm not sorry

Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me
You might also like
Hm, I been here before
Hm, hm, I been here before, hm
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
As the story goes, hey, hey
As the story goes, hm
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

(Yeah) Standin' on the cliff right off Mulholland Drive
(Yeah) Back up on my late night session remedy
(Oh) Something 'bout the night that keep me safe and warm
Just me, the universe, and everything I think
Lotta shit is weighin' on me, it's a storm
Never thought I would be back here bleeding
I'm not just some sad dude
You can see my life, how I grew, I want serenity

Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act
See, it seems I'll never learn
I won't stop 'til I crash and burn
Tell my mom I'm sorry
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

I been here before, hey, hey
I been here before, hm
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
And the story goes, hey, hey
As the story goes, hm
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me57Embed
