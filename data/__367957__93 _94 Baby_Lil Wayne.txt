21 Contributors’93 ’94 Baby Lyrics
And when they hear that new Weezy
All the dough boys go crazy
And watch the dough boys go crazy
Weezy f. ya heard yea I do it for the money baby that's my word
And when they hear that new weezy it remind them of that old baby
93 94 baby yea before the stunna yea the real bird man
I'm the Birdman Jr

Yeah, jumped in the game as a youngin' no sisters no brothers
All i had was some money (yea)
Learn how to work the stove and the oven
In the kitchen tryin' make a 20 turn in to a 100 (yea)
The pot runnin over wit hot water
Throw a 8 ball in it watch it come back harder (harder)
The come back kid come back carter yea
That's what they screamin' loud as Aretha
And for them Franklins we pop at the ceaser
Ridin round with the whole block with the speakers (yea)
We in Miami we stoppin at teasers (yea)
Have a cigar and a shot of tequila (patron)
I use to wear two socks with my sneakers (hey)
Back when i was puttin all my rocks in my sneakers
Yea but now i'm rockin ya speakers
I'm all grown up now i'm rockin with divas yea
I could rock 'em to sleep
But I rather be at home straight rockin the kibeler
I'm up in traffic bobbin and weavin
I'm in and out like pussy and penis
It's lunch time I'm a cook up genious(yea)
20 for Serena 10 for the Venus
Yea i can get ya higher then a tennis skirt
Never filled out a application got plenty work
You might also like

I'm lookin at 24 bricks on the counter
I'll make them dissapear in 24 hours (gone)
(yea) i'm really so honest that hot boy shit it's really so behind us
We on some new shit you niggas can't find us
That's like lookin in the rough for a diamond
We might hook a nigga up on consignment
And for the rest his life we keep an eye on 'em
Bussiness bad, fuck you pay me
Oh you had a fire, fuck u pay me
I'm might run through 80 in a week
But i can make a quarter million dollars off 1 street
Top in the game off one feet
Then i landed on two and i walked on through
What can you do when you living like me
Get fly in the house leave the pimpin in the street
As quiet as a mouse when you dippin through the street
If you lookin for some work you probably run into me
And on the humble the number still cheap
But the judge got numbers for a nigga to steep
Yea from a youngin to a g
Weezy baby from bundle to a key

And when they hear that new weezy all the dough boys go crazy
And watch the dough boys go crazy
Weezy f. ya heard yea i do it for the money baby that's my word
And when they hear that new weezy it remind them of that old baby
93 94 baby yea before the stunna yea the real bird man
I'm the bird man jr
I remember havin' a mouth full a gold outta control
And jumped in this game upon one roll
And got the game off the floor got the game on the low
Nigga cookin this raw dope
Never thought when i see the light i'll see the limo tints grindin with the street strips
This the family homie where g's man up with the hammers on 'em
I'm where the danger be nigga where eye contact will get you natural beef bitch
Nigga where lil g's have big straps back in the game nigga the g's had the big macs yea
Call your national guard niggas cause we don't give a fuck well pull yo car nigga shit
And had a g4 iced up loaded with bitch niggas stunna islands same night
And i remember when i first saw puff nigga i was in the projects camouflaged up nigga
Like fuck them shiny suits we hood nigga white tee's is what we do
Yea we young and tough nigga fuck the other foes man we's is standin up
Nigga jumped in the same lane same niggas all shouting out the same thing
Like 93 wasn't a shame a nigga playin with me and i'll bust his mother f**kin brain
I'll cook a thing nigga give it to the lil homie keep the change nigga
Deep boys deep in the flame know it ain't nothing but the bling bling king
Certified of made man me and the j.r so kiss a nicca pinky ring

And when they hear that new weezy all the dough boys go crazy
And watch the dough boys go crazy
Weezy f. ya heard yea i do it for the money baby that's my word
And when they hear that new weezy it remind them of that old baby
93 94 baby yea before the stunna yea the real bird man
I'm the Birdman jrEmbed
