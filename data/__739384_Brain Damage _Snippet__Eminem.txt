Scalpel
Here
Sponge
Here
Wait...he's convulsing, he's convulsing
Ah
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my! Oh my God
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
(Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse)
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny looking White boy
Scrawny and always ornery
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies picking on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high this kid said
It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
I looked at my watch it was 1:20
I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me
He said, don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse
My palms were sweaty
And I started to shake at first
Something told me, try to fake a stomach ache, it works
I screamed, oww, my appendix feels like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse
"What's the matter"
I don't know, my leg, it hurts
"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy"
Oh I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
But don't you wanna give me after school detention
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'mma let him"

Brain damage
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was going
But everywhere I go they keep playing my song
Brain damage
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was going
But everywhere I go they keep playing my songEmbed
