(I'm high, man, I’m smokin')
I'm riding, I’m locin'
I get the coke, I'm the dopeman
Sunroof open, shawty, she open
'Cause a nigga holdin'
(I'm high, man, I'm smokin')
I’m riding, I’m locin'
I get the coke, I’m the dopeman
Sunroof open, shawty, she open
'Cause a nigga holdin'

Stick your hand out, I'll cut it off
Based on my last year’s income I'm a boss
I made up for what I lost
Cross my heart, I never lie
Oh God, don't let me down
Fuck security guards, look what they did to T.I
 bras, nigga, 'cause if I wasn't fly
She would let a nigga wet me up and hang me out  to dry
Throw your money in the sky, I'm the one to pick it up
Call me 50's cash cow, or call me Young Buck

I ain't a politician, I'm a walking ambition
If it don't make sense, I don't listen, I won't sniff it
Shit, if I could freeze, it would've been happened
I'm icey as a prince, no thin platinum
I'm packing, then I'm going when the wind backing
Cause New York City streets got my rims cracking
My fame got long lost kin asking
I gotta conquer and win passion
Twin Benz matching

(I'm high, man, I'm smokin')
I'm riding, I'm locin'
I get the coke, I'm the dopeman
Sunroof open, shawty, she open
'Cause a nigga holdin'
(I'm high, man, I'm smokin')
I'm riding, I'm locin'
I get the coke, I'm the dopeman
Sunroof open, shawty, she open
'Cause a nigga holdin'

I'mma shine like Shaq on the Phoenix Suns
I'm a seven-star nigga with my feet in the slums
Homie, the coupe spotless, got a box for the knockers
Y'all niggas ain't gangsta, y'all internet bloggers
I'll make a movie out a nigga trying to YouTube me
 U-turn, nigga, let off three
I'm a G, Soutshide, anybody get it
Nigga, fuck some Ed Hardy's, buy a fifth with a 

Got a Mac, a .9 and an .8 in the safe
Got the hex, the Lex and a camera by the place
Got a vest for my chest, and a drop for my bitch
I got lawyers, I'll kill you there, call it self-defense
I got connects in the Tex', I have a trunk full of bricks
Hit it soft, hit it hard, hit the strip, watch it flip
Got a fucked up attitude, I don't care
Rock hanging from my ear like a chandelier
(I'm high, man, I'm smokin')
I'm riding, I'm locin'
I get the coke, I'm the dopeman
Sunroof open, shawty, she open
'Cause a nigga holdin'
(I'm high, man, I'm smokin')
I'm riding, I'm locin'
I get the coke, I'm the dopeman
Sunroof open, shawty, she open
'Cause a nigga holdin'Embed
