12 ContributorsMy Medicine Lyrics(One, two...)

Yeah, I like to dedicate this record right here to my main man
Johnny Cash, a real American gangster
I got my nephew Whitey Ford on the guitar
Young Trev' on the drums
Grand Ole Opry, here we come, uhh

Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jacked up the spoon on the candlestick
Dopestick pimpin on the one-trick pony
Yeah she kinda skinny but she gets my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Yeah, you know I got to have that medicine
That prescription medicine baby
Y'know, purple, orange, green

Jack starts hangin 'round with some fiends
Got strung out, sold the cow for beans
Told young wifey, "I love ya honey
But you gotta hit the streets, go and get my money"
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine

Can you feel me?

Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
(And I'm high all day, every day)
You can trust every word I'm gonna say will be a lie

Haha, yeah I lie sometimes
What's the use of the truth if you can't get a lie sometimes baby?
Now dig this
Jack starts a track up and down the hill
Got to walkin thinkin ace what he told to Jill
Come rain, come shine, come snow or if it's sunny
Get the fuck out, come and get my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine
Yeah
They say you can't buy me love, but you damn sure can buy me bud

Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
(Oh I'm so high right now, how 'bout you?)
You can trust every word I'm gonna tell you is a lie
(Liar liar, haha, pants on fire)
Girl I love you (I love you though)
Yeahhhh!3Embed
