Alright
Shit hard as fuck
Look
Hussle

All I do is rap about the fast life
You can't relate, you need to get your cash right
I must have been a flashlight in my last life
Because all I do is shine so blow me like a bagpipe
Woodgrain, grams, and gold chains
I'm shutting down traffic I'm switching four lanes
I'm hanging out the window every which way
Every nigga not a pimp but every bitch pay
I'm hard on these hoes like every single day
And I gotta lot of bitches in a lot of different states
I get a lot of pussy but I never got to pay
And all money in is all a nigga got to say
Now one time for my young grind
I spend hundreds I smoke quarters and fuck dimes
Got no love for broke bitches with no drive
I dropped out but I done fine
Right, I know you heard about them stages I've been murdering
Lighting my swishers up as they roll in my room servicing
Them shopping sprees all the fly shit I'm purchasing
Tattoos on my face because now I know I'll never work again
Them pretty bitches that know what their sole purpose is
For them emotions they be working with
Once curb serving in
The kush I'm blowing inside of the coupe that I'm swerving in
Nigga, Slauson Ave
South Central State of Mind nigga
It's The Leak Volume 1
And this is where I'm coming from niggaYou might also likeEmbed
