Summer in da hood, it's a party all night
Walking down the streets, I see the people in flight
Hookahs blowing, beats dropping, grill frying
Passing by the homies, saying what's up and hi'ing

It's summer in da hood, it's a place to go
A place to cool off, kick back, and just flow
It's a place for me to unwind and let go
Gotta love it, summer in da hood

Every day feel like a Sunday in LBC
Cool breeze went through and hit me with that real G
Rollin' in my Benz with all the homies blazin'
Asking the Lord above, please don't change what's happening
My crew steady thriftin' like we lookin' for a come up
Ain't gonna back down, gonna drop some fire to make it jump
A seal of protection with my homeboys, I'ma keep it comin'
Causе this the 'hood, all day, it's summer in da hood nigga
 It's summer in da hood, it's a placе to go
A place to cool off, kick back, and just flow
It's a place for me to unwind and let go
Gotta love it, summer in da hoodYou might also likeEmbed
