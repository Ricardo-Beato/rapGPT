Shout out to my set
Shout out to my set (Squad)
Shout out my connect
Shout out my connect (Gucci)
Shout out to my check
Shout out to my check (Squad)
Shout out my wrist and neck (Brr, brr)
Shout out my wrist and neck (Brr, brr)
I'm a man of respect
Man of respect (Brick Squad)
Another nigga with a check
Nigga with a check (Huh)
I'm a man of respect
Man of respect (Squad)
Another nigga with a check
Nigga with a check, huh

Shout out to your main bitch, shout out to her neck
It's cold outside, ain't got time to play, so please don't get wet
It's just me and my young boy at your front door with that tech
Ain't shit free, that's it for me, I demand a check
Shout out to my weed men, I call them the geek squad
I smoke too much, I just lost my thoughts, I'm feeling like a retard
Got two best freaks plus me riding in that two seater
They face to face, I'm by myself, but they hugging like a wife beater
Shout out to my OG, for him, I'm putting in work
Shout out to them real killers that's putting in that twerk
Wooh Da King a real nigga, shout out to my set
Shout out to my jeweler for my wrist and neck
You might also like
Shout out to my set
Shout out to my set (Squad)
Shout out my connect
Shout out my connect (Gucci)
Shout out to my check
Shout out to my check (Squad)
Shout out my wrist and neck (Brr, brr)
Shout out my wrist and neck (Brr, brr)
I'm a man of respect
Man of respect (Brick Squad)
Another nigga with a check
Nigga with a check (Huh)
I'm a man of respect
Man of respect (Squad)
Another nigga with a check
Nigga with a check, huh

Shout out to my accountant, my attorneys and my manager
And shout out to them 26's that's sitting up on my challenger
I'm professional, you an amateur, you an artist, I'm an animal
I eat rappers, I'm Hannibal, not accountable, I'm a carnivore
I'm a dinosaur, you a herbivore, I use verbs and words you ain't heard before
Fake trapper never sold birds before, probably never even used dirty words before
But not me, can't stop me, ain't no hood nigga gon' top me
I'm focused, just watch me, I send a shout out to my posse
I send a shout out to my AR, my Tech-9 and my AK
I don't play, not ne'er day, not ne'er way, I'm Gucci
Salute me or shoot me, make your next move your best move
Every move I make is a chess move, real goons don't aim for the chest, fool
It's Gucci
Shout out to my set
Shout out to my set (Squad)
Shout out my connect
Shout out my connect (Gucci)
Shout out to my check
Shout out to my check (Squad)
Shout out my wrist and neck (Brr, brr)
Shout out my wrist and neck (Brr, brr)
I'm a man of respect
Man of respect (Brick Squad)
Another nigga with a check
Nigga with a check (Huh)
I'm a man of respect
Man of respect (Squad)
Another nigga with a check
Nigga with a check, huh1Embed
