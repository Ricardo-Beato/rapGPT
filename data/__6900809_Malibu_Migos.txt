59 ContributorsMalibu Lyrics
You understand what I'm sayin'?
(Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Hey, hey
(Nas, the pack just touched down)
Hey

I bought me a drop (Drop)
I'm switchin' out hoes and thots (Switch out the thots)
I Richie'd the watch (Richie)
I made me an M on the spot (M on the spot)
I took twenty-five hoes in Malibu on my yacht (Twenty-five hoes)
I got twenty-five M's in the bank, no cap, no lie (Yes sir)

Run up an M, ain't tricking (Run it up)
Chrome Hearts cross, I'm Christian (Chrome Hearts)
Sippin' on dirt, no whiskey (Dirt)
Bought me a Spur, big Bentley (Spurt)
I'm from the Nawf, put a hole in your boss
And then caught me a lil' bitty fifty (Fifty ball)
I bought a 'Cat with a wide body back
Take it out to burn out, and go fishing (Skrrt, hеy)

You did this shit with handouts, or with no help?
If you think I'd cross and take my mans out, just kill yourself
In thе trenches, .40 on my hip, I had to fix my belt
Can't listen to critics 'cause they can't relate to shit I felt
Chrome Hearts, Fendi prints, shopping sprees, expensive shit
Hennessy, she gettin' lit, hoes in threes, splitting dick
Six deep in Suburbans, totin' felonies, we with the shits
Catch a opp, get the stick, bodies drop, flip the switch
Hit Rodeo, splurgin', fuck a price tag, we rich as shit
Drip so hard on purpose, diamonds no flaws, make niggas sick
In that two-door swervin', screamin' "Fuck 'em all" 'Cause niggas switched
Just bet' not be lurkin' 'cause this .40 Glock gon' give 'em kiss
You might also like
I bought me a drop (Drop)
I'm switchin' out hoes and thots (Switch out the thots)
I Richie'd the watch (Richie)
I made me an M on the spot (M on the spot)
I took twenty-five hoes in Malibu on my yacht (Twenty-five hoes)
I got twenty-five M's in the bank, no cap, no lie (Yes sir)

I'm fresh out the kitchen, my watch is three-fifty
The Glock hold a .50, the mafia sticky (Let's get it)
The paperwork say that you snitchin' (Rat)
I call him like, "Listen, the extra two-fifty" (Bought him)
He stankin' somebody shitted (Stank)
He a demon at heart, so he with it (Demon)
He gon' blank on the Percocet, kill him (Blank)
Gotta pay me five M, that's the minimum (Five)
Green emerald Patek, it's limited (Patek)
My stick is dramatic, get critical (Dramatic)
I roll up the Gary with Cereal (Gary)
Big Cullinan, orange interior (Cullinan)
You know that my gang ain't goin' (Woo)
Fuck cash, got rent on my arm (Ow)
Door dash, he come out, we blow him (Boom)
He dead in the street, call the coroner (Dead)
Young nigga playin' for keep (Keeps)
Step on the opp, and we rock him to sleep (Step on the opp)
I'm popping Xan' for sleep
I'm really wishing my man could breathe (My mans)
It's only the man in me
God forgive me, this man deceased (God)
We'll cut off your hands, come see (Hey)
We score on the opps by three
I bought me a drop (Drop)
I'm switchin' out hoes and thots (Switch out the thots)
I Richie'd the watch (Richie)
I made me an M on the spot (M on the spot)
I took twenty-five hoes in Malibu on my yacht (Twenty-five hoes)
I got twenty-five M's in the bank, no cap, no lie (Yes sir)

Wide body spinnin', come out of the dealer (Soo)
Look at your boy, not your average nigga (Nah)
Who on the mound? It's Quavo, the pitcher
I'm pitching out bullets, them trackers, them missiles (Bow, bow)
I don’t even fuck with ya', bitch ass nigga (No)
Out the basement, but the gang ain't tickin'
Left hand shot from the top, like who? (Who?)
Left hand shot from the top like Fisher
Hold that chopper on my shoulder like a Fendi belt (Yeah)
Two-point-five, all in jewelry
Stand too close, you'll freeze to death (Freeze)
This lil' bitch vision blurry
So she can't even see herself (Nah)
Suckin' dick and flying Spirit
Baby you need to free yourself (Free)
It's a phone number
What you seeing in that digi' scale (Yes)
Take the shake, that's the bait
Finesse on 'em, then we outta there (Yeah)
State-to-state, we created all kind of clientele (Yeah)
You know we great, you can't debate, new generation, we all created
I bought me a drop (Drop)
I'm switchin' out hoes and thots (Switch out the thots, switch)
I Richie'd the watch (Richie)
I made me an M on the spot (M on the spot)
I took twenty-five hoes in Malibu on my yacht (Twenty-five hoes, twenty-five)
I got twenty-five M's in the bank, no cap, no lie (Yes sir)

Takeoff, how much you got?
I got twenty-five-plus in the bank, no goddamn lie (M&M's)
Don't talk about the stash, but you know I brag
A nigga run-up, he gon' die (Bow)
Hit in the eye (Brr, brr), hit with the fire'
Walk in the kitchen while countin' my chicken
I put my wrist in, and I'm breaking the pot (Whip it)
Movin' the dope, can't break in the spot (Move)
I hit the lot, and I leave with a lot
Stop by the block, and I sold me a block (Serve)
I poured a drop, I was sitting in a drop (Drink)
Back in the day, blew the bag on a thot
Now we invest in watches and stock (Hot)
How the fuck that shit cost a ticket? I don't see ice in that watch (Where?)
I done been rich like Roddy, all of my niggas will send you the box (Where?)
I got the stick, opps
I told you that we gon' make it like the LOX (I told you)
I can't kick it with the opps (No)
We never went missing
We just were chilling watching niggas all from the top (Look at 'em)
I know that I'm great, so give me my props

I bought me a drop (Drop)
I'm switchin' out hoes and thots (Switch out the thots)
I Richie'd the watch (Richie)
I made me an M on the spot (M on the spot)
I took twenty-five hoes in Malibu on my yacht (Twenty-five hoes)
I got twenty-five M's in the bank, no cap, no lie (Yes sir)5Embed
