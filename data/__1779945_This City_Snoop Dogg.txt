30 ContributorsThis City Lyrics
A-yessir, radio station B-U-S-H-69 on your dial
Takin' it to the streets
Shout out to the people out there in the city living that life
We 'bout to get off into this brand new
Snoop Dogg (Oh) produced by Pharrell
So everybody in the city tonight
I want to you to roll your windows down (Oh, oh)
And turn your music up loud, and enjoy yourselves (Oh)
The radio station B-U-S-H-6-9 on your dial

Grab your money
We're getting out this neighborhood
Milk and honey
We're gonna burn up Hollywood, ooh

Beach of fortune and the neon sky
You know all that glitters will be gold tonight
That's what they told us and they must be right
So let's ride, they built this city for you and me, yeah

Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me, yeah
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me, yeah
You might also like
Champagne wishes
Taste like American pie ('Merican pie)
Rags to riches
You never know unless you try, ooh (Know unless you try)

Beach of fortune and the neon sky
You know all that glitters will be gold tonight
That's what they told us and they must be right
So let's ride, they built this city for you and me, yeah

Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me, yeah
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me, yeah

All day wanna play, wanna rock with her
All day, every day on the block with her
My city oh really be popping, huh?
6-4s, hip hop and locking up
We changed the lane, remained the bain
Little bit of joy with a lot of pain
Is he Snoop Lion or Doggy, mayne? (What?)
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same
D-O-Dubb with the key to the city
Me and P, we go, "Doo-wa-ditty"
Rip down, put my foot down
And if I'm in your town then I got to get down
Fight nights in Vegas
Bright lights, we made it
Slayed it, slightly faded (What?)
Californicated and highly motivated
Snooooooop (Snoop)
They built this city for you and me, yeah
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me, yeah (Me, hahaha)
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me, yeah
Snooooooop
They built this city for you and me, yeah8Embed
