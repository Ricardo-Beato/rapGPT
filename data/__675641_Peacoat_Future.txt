(Zaytoven)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, Wizard
R.I.P. OGD
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Peacoat, Burberry, fours, aw, man
Peacoat, Burberry, and this Hermes
I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy
Peacoat, Burberry, Fendi, aw, man
Prada, Bally, Bally, aw, ooh, Hermes, woo
I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy
Yeah, yeah (Future Hendrix)

I spent a check on that pussy (Let's get it)
I put MoÃ«t on that pussy (One hundred)
I go to war 'bout these cookies (I swear)
I got it like, "Woo," when I'm cooking (One hundred)
Valet the car on that water, water (One hundred)
I fuck on her, she got water, water (One hundred)
He want her, she want her, beat on her
Think I might pull out my dick and I pee on her (Turn up)
She twenty-one keys like a piano (Straight up)
I fuck around, serve you a piano (Pour up)
And I keep the Burberry, dripping like raspberry
Sauce for the matters, you don't even matter
Codeine comin' out my bladder (Oh)
Gotta kill all the chatter, yeah, yeah (Hold up)
We go to Soho to get you Manolo
I'll put Chanel on your mojo

I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy
Peacoat, Burberry, Fendi, aw, man

I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy
I spent a check on that pussy

I was the one sipping Chandon (Yeah)
She got that number one pum-pum (One hundred)
I'ma fly her out to Kingston (One hundred)
Fuck them receipts, I'ma throw away (Throw away)
I spent the cake on a throwaway (Throwaway)
We do the yacht on some fun fun, we kickin' shit on a daily basis
We fuck around and gon' make a baby (Hold up)
I be in Prada like Perry Ellis (Yeah)
She told her ex farewell (Yeah)
I see what she'll do for a pair of heels (Yeah)
Got you popping them Percs like an Advil (Woo)
You found out Future bought a Burberry (Future)
She found out Future bought a Burberry (Freebandz)
Future cut her off like K CAMP
Peacoat, Burberry, fours, aw, man

You know, swimmin' under all this water
And the sharks done missed it (Just what?)
