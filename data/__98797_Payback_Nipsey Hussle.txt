8 ContributorsPayback Lyrics
Those little girls are being murdered
Those niggas are being shot down in broad day light
Now you tell me why the leaders of this struggle
Have never taken it before the United Nations

What its been like six years
You still lookin for Osama?
You gonna send more troops
That's your solution to the problem
With no evidence, yall never found the bomb
But that ain't stop yall from killing Tookie or Sadam
A neccessary evil, ain't that the term you use
Hundred thousand something soldiers went to serve for you
So you bury your people and let them burn for you
Over some oil cause the issue ain't concerning you
Since 9/11 you been talking 'bout the threat we facin'
And how you need a couple billion to protect the nation
But look, come to my hood i'll show you desperation
Kids dead at 13 like Devin Brown, with no explanation
Living in LA every single day
It's a war going on outside, no man is safe from
But since it's just niggas killing niggas
You just turn prison to a business

Talkin Payback
I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness who strap with macks
Knew I wouldn't play that

You a blood, I'm a crip
You a tre, I'm a O
If you was raised on Slauson you would be one too
Your homeboys get low when they see me come through
And they say that I ain't got crack, And that would be untrue
But every now and then I think if we can get back to
That black shit, instead of killing for banging and crack shit
We'll be active
These niggas too stuck in their ways
I know we long overdue, but is we ready for change?
And stand under one flag like an army brigade
It's time to put the duece duece down and pick up a K
And if we banging on some black shit
Lets ride for the dead homies
Get the burners for Malcom and Natt Turner
Talking to them other niggas
Yea, my so called enemies
We don't own one block
We live and die for these city streets
And even though the pain run deeper
Real nigga know it's time to make peace, so we can focus on the

Payback
I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness who strap with macks
Knew I wouldn't play that

Look, Fuck a injunction
I ain't violate nothin'
If you put your hands on me
Ima bust you, I ain't running
On the real, All you crash Johnny's know the deal
Once we start the revolution
All you probably do is squeal
Automatic weapons on my back, unconcealed
And I don't care where your from cause real recognize real
Every step is like chess, the wrong move gets you killed
So we act on how we think and never speak on how we feel
I don't believe 9/11 was Osama
Cause 9/11, Bush made a billion dollars
I heard them say gang violence was a problem
And they think that more prisons is a step to resolve it
But most prisons mean the checks keep revolving
And it don't take a rocket scientist to see the conflict
You can't cover up the pain with fake progress
It's time they pay back a portion of the profit

I'm talkin payback
I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness who strap with macks
Knew I wouldn't play that1Embed
