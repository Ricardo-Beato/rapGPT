35 ContributorsTown on the Hill Lyrics
Thought I didn't know you
You thought I didn't know you
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
We never take you outside
You never turn a crazy thing down
We never take you outside
You never turn a crazy thing down
You thought I didn't know you
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
I didn't owe you anything, gave you

They built a town on top of a hill
Yellow in hue, standing in plain sight
This caught my eye and spoke to my soul
"What a good deed," I said

Thank you, Father, Father
Thank you, Father, Father
You might also like
They built a town on top of a hill
It was yellow in hue, 'cause it was bursting with light
And that's when I caught a view, what a magnificent sight
'Cause it reminds me of You, I guess

Thank you, Father, Father
You really love me
You really love me
Father, Father (Down)
You really love me

Down
We never take you outside
You never turn a crazy thing down
We never take you outside
You never turn a crazy thing down
You thought I didn't know you
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
I didn't owe you anything, gave youEmbed
