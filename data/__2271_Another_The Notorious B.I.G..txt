47 ContributorsAnother Lyrics
Yeah, fuck you
Fuck you too
Fuck you bitch
Fuck you motherfucker
You ain't shit anyway, fuck you
You ain't shit, you fat motherfucker
Yeah, whatever whatever
Whatever
You wasn't sayin' that when you was suckin' my dick
You wasn't sayin that when you was eatin' my pussy
You nasty bitch
You a nasty motherfucker
Check it, uhh
(Crab ass nigga)

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
You cut the hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (Another bitch), in my life

Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked another nigga dick, y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six, y'all
Thought they was creepin', took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trial
Where I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightenin'
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold-digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boon coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin' in My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistics tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin' 'bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, when she beep you, don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin' 'bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
We'll be all fuckin' tonight, knahmean?!
(I'm fuckin' you toniiight..) feel me? Uhh
You might also like
What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

Mmm, uhhh, uhhh!
'Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the ho
Nigga pack your shit, you out the do', ohh
What about the fight in The Mirage?
I seen ya Benz parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was your friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Q.B. hang like plaques on the wall in your pictures
Scale them fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' your heat in the passenger seat of the Nautica Jeep
We've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', "Kim you need to leave him!"
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin' 'bout the bitches I fought
Over you, nigga have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort
You see, nine outta ten niggas ain't shit
One outta five niggas suck a dick
You're mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canap√©
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach
What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
You cut the hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (Another bitch), in my life

What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
You cut the hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (Another bitch), in my life

What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life9Embed
