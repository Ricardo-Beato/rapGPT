(Uh) Glamour life style baby (Dum dum dum dum), bottle the rocks (Yeah yeah)
Freeze the ice, 100 mil kid, money, money, money, mo'
Platinum status, (Word word, yeah, what up?, what up?)
Stick around

Yo, I plan to live a life a-glamour like my man Tony Montana
Stand and pose in front of cameras with my golden silk pyjamas on
Smoking Havana's, drinking Dom P
Thinking beyond deeper than Gandhi while I'm in the Diamante
Counting my G's, I'm out to be a millionaire
Dipped in gear, flickin' hundred dollar bills in the air
Oh yeah, Cuban Link is into getting Benjamin's
'Cause if doesn't make dollars, then it doesn't make sense
I represent, I meant to be the King of New York
Went from living in tenements to a penthouse resort
I'm the Latino, that'll take you to war like Al Pacino
Even DeNiro know not to gamble in my Casino
Vino on the rocks, lobster dinners with mobsters
I got shit locked from Prospect Ave' to the tropics
Sitting on top of the world like the Sun
A living legend from the Bronx, second to none, unless it's Pun

It's the Glamour Life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice sweared about the sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life
You might also like
Ripped off from the Infiniti
Dump the body an' the shottie down the lake, leaving no identity
Just the memory, a casualty as I casually make move on my rivalries
All eyes I be, on the quest for loot, pushing a Lexus coupe
To pursuit them troops against the big choker
Sipping alimoca, playing poker with some chocha
Heard an approacher, must be fam
Or the hammer have to smoke Pun (Get the motherfucking guns)
Since now I've become the one wanted for a lump sum of G's
Dirty rats pack gats for cheese, bullets of breeze at light speed
Taking your pretty wife life and sacrificing your seeds
Indeed, we let him bleed for 50 G's
Ship his body to the states, filled with 50 ki's
Please, no remorse for your two face
As I assemble my rifle out the motherfucking suitcase
You about to take who's place? Not Seis...
Your body'll be laced, and left without a trace

The glamour life, the glamour life, yo
Yo, it's the glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice swear about the sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life
Yo, it's the motherfucking Don Cartagena the leader, Terror Squad cleaner
Leave your family crying for you like Argentina, mira
Street dreamer like Nas, my entourage is thick
Camouflaged in this bitch, so God forbid you start some shit
My squad's equipped with an arsenal of ammunition
Hollow tips an', cop killers with the carved initialin'
Accounts in Switzerland for rainy days
Nigga I'm staying paid, you's a joke, always broke with your lazy ways
Anyway, back to the subject, in the bub-Lex
In the back seat, having rough sex
I love this glamorous life I live, having the ice and shit
Think twice, I give Christ your kids
I live life for gifts, keep the fire burning while the tides turning
I blaze an L and seek a higher learning
Cat is earnin' everything illegally
We could be friend for years, cross me once thatâ€™s thievery

The glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice sweared about the sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life

Yo, the dough, the rap, the audience, party heavy 'til the 40's in
Ill like the Yakuza run the Orient
Take all the rent, an old man wept the path his daughter went
Dicks with the Fallopian, wide as auditorium
She fuck for dough for opium, prostitute emporium
500 Benz, 500 friends sell Cambodian
8 cups of vodka, 4 cups of juice for sodium
Money, money, sweet as the smell of magnolia
It gets you dime bitches spitting image of Apollonia
Now how can I go broke, pumping twenties of coke
Plus songs I wrote, milkin' dumb honies I poke
The young blood sat on the bench in Vant Courtland, slingin'
Singing how he trying to get cash for Jordans
Another cat toss his Beamer to get the insurance
Currency's gonna murder me... it's never enough
Breakin' my ass gettin' it, just as fast as I spend the stuff
Calling Uncle Sam's bluff dun, taxes don't bite us, bite us....
My life... yo, it's the glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice sweared about the sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life

The glamour life, play precise, defense is tight
I'm out to settle the score, let's do it right
Enough for looking at grave, it's paying back tonight
Yo Twin pass the lye, pass the light
The glamour life, this life I live is trife as shit
Least my wife and kid got somewhere nice to live
I used to live in the gutter, me and my mother
Now she's fifty years old, pushing a hummer
The glamour life, hand me a knife I'll slice and dice
Men or Mice, send them to Christ in the after life
Pass the mic down the line, let them hear it
Let them fear it, send 'em screaming to the Holy Spirit

Glamour life, the glamour life, the glamour life
It's the glamour life, yo it's the glamour, it's the glamour life
The glamour life, the glamour life, the glamour life
Cock the hammer, end his motherfucking life, bitch13Embed
