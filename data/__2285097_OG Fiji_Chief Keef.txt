10 ContributorsOG Fiji Lyrics
I got that Fiji water, that OG
I'm smoking loud like, fuck the police
I'm brought that cash out, and I brought more weed
I got that Fiji water, and that OG

I got that Fiji water, Fiji water
Fiji water, Fiji water
I got that OG, got that OG
I got that OG, I got that OG
I got that Fiji water, Fiji water
Fiji water, Fiji water
I got that Fiji water, Fiji water
Fiji water, I got that Fiji water and that OG

Got that Fiji water and an O of the skunk
Walk in the mall, pointin' like I know what I want
I walked on the lot, pointin' like I know where I'm goin'
I'm goin' to the spaceship, you should know where I'm goin'
Went up in the bank takin' out 50K
Walked in the bank smirking in the teller's face
I walked in the bank they say I smell like an 8th
I said I smoked a muthafuckin' 14th today
She say she want some cheese, but she won't get paid
I say go roll some weed, baby it's not laced
I'm smokin' OG up in my spaceship
He say he wanna race me, I'm nothin' to play with
You might also like
I got that Fiji water, that OG
I'm smoking loud like, fuck the police
I'm brought that cash out, and I brought more weed
I got that Fiji water, and that OG

I got that Fiji water, Fiji water
Fiji water, Fiji water
I got that OG, got that OG
I got that OG, I got that OG
I got that Fiji water, Fiji water
Fiji water, Fiji water
I got that Fiji water, Fiji water
Fiji water, I got that Fiji water and that OG

I got Fiji water, OG, cops come, fuck that police
Bitches come, they want me, ask 'em, yeah they know me
On the lot I coped that foolish whip, I'm like Shawty Lo me
I pull off with that stupid whip, I'm like Tity Boi me
Cash on me, all me, big counts, only me
And Gambino he got my thing, and he gon' make it sing
I tell 'em "do it slowly", don't got no time for police
Hop in the car, we speedin', runnin' from the police
I'm in that thing with four seats, I ain't feel like two seats
All these bitches call me, ask me what I'm doin'
I lie and say I'mma call 'em back, I'm colder than my jewelry
All these bitches text my phone like "Sosa, how you doin'?"
I got that Fiji water, that OG
I'm smoking loud like, fuck the police
I'm brought that cash out, and I brought more weed
I got that Fiji water, and that OG

I got that Fiji water, Fiji water
Fiji water, Fiji water
I got that OG, got that OG
I got that OG, I got that OG
I got that Fiji water, Fiji water
Fiji water, Fiji water
I got that Fiji water, Fiji water
Fiji water, I got that Fiji water and that OG3Embed
