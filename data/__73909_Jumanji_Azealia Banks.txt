23 ContributorsJumanji Lyrics
This is that jammer, jammer
Go Anthem-banana-getter
You got a question, I'll answer
For llama mama, I'm better
But better p-put your bets up
Trendsetters said get her cheddar
Chinchillas, feathers, and leathers
AB, AB, the two letters

About my bread 'til dead up
I plan to blam on long hammers
Long weave out the limo
Na-na-na-na-na-na-ana
They want my photos and pictures
Inside of they candid cameras
Bloggers, critics, and scandals
Man-handle-savage, I damage ya

Real bitch, all day
Uptown, Broadway
Real bitch, all day
Uptown, Broadway
You might also like
That cannon, cannon can damn ya
Ya auntie, nanas, and grandmas
They all jam in the jammer
Come join in and put ya hands up (Let's go)

Reefer and cabanas
All my vehicles handsome
The Mullers with the bezels
I bought 'em to spoil the fellas
These bitches and they banter
Fuck is up with they grammar
They never talking money
I can never understand 'em

That cutie, cutie, bam-beauty
That juicy juicy who truly pack
Tooly’s oozies in Gucci’s
You fruity tootie and booty
Don't make me remove ya kufi
I do it cause it's my duty
Crazy and kinda spooky
Yo boobie, step up ya coochie
Rude bitch, all day
Uptown, Broadway
Rude bitch, all day
Uptown, Broadway

All of my bitches bougie
Designer vagina coochie
These niggas all kinda groupies
They fly and they tryna scoop me

Reefer and cabanas
All my vehicles handsome
The Mullers with the bezels
I bought 'em to spoil the fellas
These bitches and they banter
Fuck is up with they grammar
They never talking money
I can never understand 'em
Reefer and cabanas
All my vehicles handsome
The Mullers with the bezels
I bought 'em to spoil the fellas
These bitches and they banter
Fuck is up with they grammar
They never talking money
I can never understand 'em
Get that, split that
Make 'em spin that
Grip that, flip that
Make ya chips stack

Real bitch, all day
Uptown, Broadway
Real bitch, all day
Uptown, Broadway

Get that, split that
Make 'em spin that
Grip that, flip that
Make ya chips stack9Embed
