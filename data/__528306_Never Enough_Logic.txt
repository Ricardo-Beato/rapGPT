90 ContributorsNever Enough Lyrics
When that liquor get po’ up
And that green get roll up
When them sets get throwed up
I’m like nah man, hol’ up
Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff
Better hope they don’t call my bluff
Cause my mind is going crazy
This shit is never enough

When that liquor get po’ up
And that green get roll up
When them sets get throwed up
I’m like nah man, hol’ up
Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff
Better hope they don’t call my bluff
Cause my mind is going crazy
This shit is never enough

Never enough, never enough, never enough
This shit is never enough

Never enough, never enough, never enough
This shit is never enough
You might also like
Not even, not even, not even, not enough
Not even, not even, not even, not enough
Not even, not even, not even, not enough
Not even, not even, not even, not enough

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
At the party with my homies, walk up and they play my shit
On the road, tickets sold, didn’t have to sell my soul
Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal
Where you stay, every day, just got my crib in LA
Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ
Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh
Bitches on my dick, don’t give a fuck, y’all must not know what’s up
In the cut, we don’t give a fuck, we just trying to cut
Line em up, if they say they bout it then we’ll sign em up
Rattpack, that’s a fact, basic bitch can’t fuck with that
Where you at? That’s what they be asking, I say on the map
Who we are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
Drop that new shit just cause they demand it
Living like we got it cause we get it
Do it just to say we fucking did it
Who we are, the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
Drop that new shit just cause they demand it
Living like we got it cause we get it
Do it just to say we fucking did it

When that liquor get po’ up
And that green get roll up
When them sets get throwed up
I’m like nah man, hol’ up
Yea we bout it, sho ‘nuff
Better hope they don’t call my bluff
Cause my mind is going crazy
This shit is never enough

Never enough, never enough, never enough
This shit is never enough

Not even, not even, not even, not enough
