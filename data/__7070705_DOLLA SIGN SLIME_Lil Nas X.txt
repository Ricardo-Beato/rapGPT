D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

Y'all take a rumor then y'all go and wear it out
Fuck all that talkin' 'bout who's and the whereabouts
I walk in Neiman's and Marcus, I'm buried out
Walk in the bank and say, "Fuck it, let's clear it out"

I'm the same dollar sign slime, they gon' hear me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, they gon' feel me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah

Yeah, album gon' hit like it's '82
Got a new whip and it's navy blue (Navy blue)
Top of the game, only twenty-two
Look at me, nigga, then look at you (Look at you)
You just an opp and a flop of a nigga
I'm sorry that I gotta say thе truth
Thought I went pop, but I popped on you niggas
Now, I'm with the hits likе I'm Babe Ruth (Ah)
Bitch, I do not do labor (Uh-huh)
You know I done got too major (Ah)
Bought a new house, few acres (Uh-huh)
I done went and got new neighbors
So fuck all that, "Nas, be considerate"
I'm really that nigga that's killin' it
Man, all of y'all niggas equivalent
I'm really that nigga that's different
You might also like
Y'all take a rumor then y'all go and wear it out
Fuck all that talkin' 'bout who's and the whereabouts
I walk in Neiman's and Marcus, I'm buried out
Walk in the bank and say, "Fuck it, let's clear it out"

I'm the same dollar sign slime, they gon' hear me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, they gon' feel me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah
I'm the same dollar sign slime (Real hot girl shit, ayy)

They can't stop me
Say I can't do it, bitch, watch me (Watch me)
All you lame hoes turned hatin' to a hobby
Damn, watchin' me gotta turn you on (Turn you on)
I should have my own category in porn
Ooh, I'm just such an obsession
Tea about me in IG suggestions
Thick, no add-on prosthetics
Everything about me came from genetics (Yeah)
I been gettin' money, I ain't new to this
Miss one, catch one, I ain't new to fish
But if he throwin' that rod (That rod)
And I get hooked, then you doin' your job
Baby, all these hoes imitate me
You gon' fuck a Stan or the real Slim Shady?
Toxic, suck his soul out, then block him
Got more cream than a sundae topping, ah
I'm the same dollar sign slime (Same slime), they gon' hear me
I'm the same dollar sign slime (Same slime), they gon' feel me
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah
I'm the same dollar sign slime, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah8Embed
