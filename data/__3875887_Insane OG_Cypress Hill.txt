7 ContributorsInsane OG Lyrics
See, I started as a soldier in our culture, in the shadows
My approach with every note is like I'm copin' with the battle
Every move is calculated, celebrated, no more lessons
Hit you quick, I don't get caught, I got no time for no confessions
Never move in one direction, no detection, I ain't slippin'
If you question where I'm headed, then your body comes up missin'
Bullets hissin', bodies twistin', in the ground you will get buried
Mercenary, visionary, don't become my adversary
Took the dare, I'm in a trance, when I advance the seal is broken
Send you dancin' with the Devil, holdin' metal, barrel smokin'
Hand of God, I am the rod, I am the staff that keeps you humble
I'm the hunter that you run from, I'm the lion in the jungle

I got my hand upon the gun, I'm on the run, they'll never catch me
I'm the one and only one under the sun who keeps you guessing
With my finger on the trigger, heavy hitter got you stressing
Got your blessing in my weapon, look into my Smith & Wesson
Got my hand upon the gun, I'm on the run, they'll never catch me
I'm the one and only one under the sun who keeps you guessing
With my finger on the trigger, heavy hitter got you stressing
Got your blessing in my weapon, look into my Smith & WessonYou might also like1Embed
