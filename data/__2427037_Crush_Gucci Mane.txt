What's up my nigga Scooter?
Waka what it do nigga?
You know what it is â€“ Brick Squad
10-17 all day we in here
We workin

My mama say my mansion dirty and I need to clean it up
Listen up, my money dirty, need to clean it up
I wonder how you playin for the house but you ain't clean as us
If I wasn't nominated probably never wear a tux
All white diamond chain, all black tuxedo
Rollin up blunts lookin like torpedos
Gambling in my gambling house like I'm Buzzy Siegel
Gucci Mane got legal money but I'm still illegal
45 Desert Eagle, I'm a eagle keeper
I'll make you meet your maker nigga, I'm a make a mirror
Park my Bentley, fuck the meter bitch cause Gucci's off the meter
And if the popo pull me over probably need a paralegal

Crush, crush, Gucci on crush
I know you got a crush on me, baby don't rush me
Half a pint and a purple crush, call that shit a slushie
And if you really love me baby you'll let me fuck yo buddies
You might also like
Yo buddies so fine I be fascinated by em
Infatuated by em, glancing all night
She glancing at me back, we throwin up racks
Cartier glasses, Cartier watch
Versace belt, I should've bought some Bentleys
Callin up they careless, I'm losin my balance
I can't keep balance, I took er to the mall
We bought 10 Louie bags, it wasn't no challenge
I got 2 stingers in the studio, they doin alright
Gucci jumped out the limo when the cameras start flashin
Paparazzi chasin me and I'm a try to lose em
Use em, lose em but I'm not gon refuse em

Crush, crush, Gucci on crush
I know you got a crush on me, baby don't rush me
Half a pint and a purple crush, call that shit a slushie
And if you really love me baby you'll let me fuck yo buddiesEmbed
