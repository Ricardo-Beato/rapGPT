Ugh (Cannon)

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

Couple niggas on a hit list and bitches on a different type
Same shit, different nights, 'til I live a different life
"Sean, you lookin' tired," damn, homie, that's all?
I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I ain't goin' bald
Haters prayin' I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hatin'
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin' like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleepin' with that MAC and I ain't talkin' 'bout computer love
Owe the wrong people, you a price tag
Now you pray to God, hopin' that you got a Christ tag (God)
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Take a elevator straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there, too, ugh
You might also like
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

Ooh-ooh
If I just stop
Breathin'
Even though I got all this motherfuckin'
Money
Won't keep my heart
Beatin'
Just don't wake me
Up (Don't wake me up)
You can't catch me
Dreamin'
About all of this motherfuckin'
Money
Cocaine rush, I'm
Speedin'
Cocaine rush (Yeah)
I'm just a Detroit nigga, nuttin' extra about me
I go extra harder the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection; at the same time
I'm acceptin' the fact that there'll never be nothin' perfect about me
Shit, I'm just waitin' on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 Mile-bred, that's why you see our sick style, yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks, as y'all can imagine, is chatty, yappin' at me
Five years ago I was in tears
In the back of a paddy wagon, now I'm Cali swaggin'
Huh, my nigga, listen, I'm over the fame
You number one? I'm number 23, my mission
Is to take over the game, you rollin' with lames?
We ain't rollin' the same, I'm the best out in this motherfucker
If I could get a check out of this motherfucker
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this motherfucker with no regrets
If you ain't livin' your life for your kids, I ain't givin' your ass no respect

As I look up to the sky (Sean, I love you, my nigga, I'm out)
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
I gotta break your fuckin' heart
I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb 'em)
I gotta do something that's innovative, creative, just to create a
Legacy before death do us part, I gotta spend one
Summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got aâ€”I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died
For the rights for me to survive but those who lied
To the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
The youths need to know every detail about this Earth
The Devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important, the end is near

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die29Embed
