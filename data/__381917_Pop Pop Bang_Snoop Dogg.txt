One, two, three it's me (Who dat?)
Baby bobba, I'm hot as lava, I gotta be
Eight bottles, a lot of models, a pot of bean
Top dollar, the blue impala, know what I mean? (Yes sir)
Drifting away, you, you, you can't keep running away
I wanted to say, we play the original way
Either you stay, lay the pistol or pay
We official, okay?
I got cooked up dope sent down from the Bay (Yee)
From my cousin Ricky, with the sticky icky
West Coast, baby girl, come and fuck with me

People come from everywhere to get a dose of the Cali life
Like palm trees and bomb weed
Riding on that Sunset night
Home of the Crips, yeah, cuh, that's us
Relatives gotta live, what it do, blood?
On the grind, one time, yeah, that's the pigs
Better get some heat when you're creepin' through the Beach
To each his own, the Beach is Long
Turn it up and get your T.C on
And tell 'em Snoop Dogg sent him to the block
Let it rock while it knock
Motherfucker, show you how to West Coast

Ayo, homie, keep it gangsta, tell me how the G's feel
Pop pop bang, swing it on three wheels
House party G niggas, we raised off of G-shit
When it's time to get active, you know we get sea-sick
We with the business by any means necessary
You can't fuck with this homie with heart and niggas scary
I popped her cherry, and she gave it up in a flash
We wanna bang with Snoop, we wanna bang with Daz
Hop inside a G-ride and glide, take a voyage
Back to the Eastside, Eastside's where we're going
Where the hustlers, bangers, jackers run with no worries at all
Where you learn to C-walk before you learn to crawl, so I'ma, uh
