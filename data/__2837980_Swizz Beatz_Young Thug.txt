All of my creatures with me, with me

Big racks and that Aether with me, with me (Racks)
Tote that like it's legal woody, woody (Pew)

This bitch Master P cause she 'bout it, 'bout it
That boy got cheap rims on a cheap Jeep (Hah!)
Just make sure you tell him his ho a freak (Ah)

And I got my gold off of Goldie
Work it, twerk it baby, you have to hold me, wait for home
