On lonely nights, I start to fade
On lonely nights, I start to fade
Her love's a thousand miles away
Her love's a thousand miles away

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye, my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter

It's 4 AM and I can't sleep
It's 4 AM and I can't sleep
Her love is all that I can see
Her love is all that I can see

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye, my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter, winter, winter, uh
Goodbye, my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye, my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye, my friend, will I ever love again?

If spring can take the snow away
If spring can take the snow away
Can it melt away all our mistakes?
Can it melt away all our mistakes?

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye, my friend, I won't ever love again
Never again
