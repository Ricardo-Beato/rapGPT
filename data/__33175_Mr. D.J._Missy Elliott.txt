It's all about (Yo)
Lady Saw and Missy (Can you feel me?)
An the next thing is about (Yo)
The big Bashment party (Can you feel me, what?)
I'm feelin' you Timbaland, I'm feelin' you (Yo)
Yo! (Can you feel me, what?)
And we wind up when we a listen dis now, check, ay!

There's the party
I'm up in the club and I'm drinking
I'm drunk off the Aliz√©
As I hear the record spin it seems to take over me
So I move side to side and it's something inside that controls me
As I walk to the D.J. and I say

"Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy it's gon' be for you and me, you see
Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy it's gon' be for you..."
You might also like
You say you're a baller
'Cause you up in the club, fakin' like you got dough
With your dollars
To my people, spend they money, let me hear you holler
We're gon' party like no other party, don't stop 'til the morning
But before I go, this is what I say

"Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy it's gon' be for you and me, you see
Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy it's gon' be for you..."
