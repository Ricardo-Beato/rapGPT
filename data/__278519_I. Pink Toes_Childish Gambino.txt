94 ContributorsI. Pink Toes Lyrics
Rainbows, sunshine, everywhere we go
Rainbows, sunshine, go

Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine, yeah
Rainbows, sunshine

I thought I told you 'bout it
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)
You don't leave home without it
(Move that kilo, move that kilo, move that kilo)
She on my back about it
(C3PO, C3PO, C3PO)
And all the time, oh-oh, yeah
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)

How could you ever question? They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who, what, why and where, they sport the flyest pairs
She got the nicest hair and she know life is better with this nigga
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look different
The colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy po-pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right
But as long as I look fly by prom nightâ€”go
You might also like
Rainbows (Ho!), sunshine
Rainbows (Ho!), sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine, yeah
Rainbows, sunshine

*harmonizing*
He slangs his yay through the corridors
Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least, for sure
And they say there's no way, I should stay with someone like you
But I tell them, "No"
There's no way I could stray, gotta stay with someone like you
'Cause I know one day you could take me away, far away
I know you could pay all the money you made
There'll be plenty of sunshine

I never worry 'bout it
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)
I have my nigga count it, no, no
(Back up them O's, back up them O's, back up them O's)
She's dressed up in gold
(Dressed up in gold, C3PO, C3PO)
I'm out of time, oh, no, no, no
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)
I'm out of time, oh, no, no, no, no
I'm out of time, ooh
I'm out of time, out of time
La-la-la, la-la-la (Go)
