74 ContributorsGeorgia... Bush / Weezyâ€™z Ambitionz Lyrics

This song right here is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, lost city of New Orleans...we call him this:
Georgia (That's right) Georgia (Bush)

Now, this song is dedicated to the one with the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef with you-know-who
Fuck it, he just let em kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had our niggas sitting on top their roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lotta stealing going on
Boy them cops is killas in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and President (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady?
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some folk that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965: I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now it's (Georgia) Bush
You might also like
We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you
Everybody crying but (Georgia) ain't nobody tried
There's no doubt on my mind, it was (Georgia) Bush!
We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you
Everybody crying but (Georgia) ain't nobody tried
There's no doubt on my mind, it was (Georgia) Bush!

Now, I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the White House hating
Trying to wash us away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest
They saying that you gotta have paper if you tryna come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap
See we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses
The mayor say don't worry bout it
And the children have been scorned, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fat shout, to all the rappers that helped out
Yeah we like to thank all of y'all, but fuck President (Georgia) Bush
When you see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tig' cause he died in the storm
Fuck President (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still movin' then he holdin' it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tches
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yeah!
We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you
Everybody crying but (Georgia) ain't nobody tried
There's no doubt on my mind, it was (Georgia) Bush!
We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you
Everybody crying but (Georgia) ain't nobody tried
There's no doubt on my mind, it was (Georgia) Bush!


Oh yeah
You thought we was done? Nah

Money, money, money: get a dollar and a dick
Weezy Baby that crack, motherfucka, get a fix
Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich
Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist (Yes)
Yep, I'm a motherfuckin' trip
I'm a trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit
900 to a grand, get you 28 grams
If you talking bout bricks, I'm the interstate, man
And the women say "damn", them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed spring
Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine
And with no pen I'm sorta like a bomb "Boom"
Young Tune, yeah that's what my people call me
50 thousand for the cross, tryna keep the reaper off me
I drink a lot of syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walking
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yeah
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yeah, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be the target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, Purple Heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game, no arguing
And I don't even write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep your bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch, log in
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin'
Mike Jordan, pardon my swag
But my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said "fuck it" - bought 2 houses in Miami
I can't wait to do Cribs; MTV, come on, get at me
Any rapper wan' get at me, tell ya label contact me
Half a hundred for a feature, wanna battle? I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of Miss Cita
Mom dukes, my Jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna be the boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Not a sim simma, 10 keys in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving: couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfuckin' ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin'
Spend a condo in the club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patron, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that rage flow
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hoes
Price rising for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got dough
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve
If anybody else want it, $60,000 a verse7Embed
