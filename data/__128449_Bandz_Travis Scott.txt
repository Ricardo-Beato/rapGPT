Let’s get it (let’s get it)
(Bands)

I got bands (Alright, I got bands)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow (blow)
Nigga, I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bands

Man, I'm in these streets, it's been a long day (bands)
'Bout to sign this deal and throw it all away (bands)
'Bout to cop the crib that Dame lost today (bands)
Funny look at them niggas that slippin'
You trippin', no fear, my niggas, we get it (bands)
I'm looking down at the whole world through these glass ceilings (bands)
And when I step outside bad bitches with me (bands)
Back in my section twisting that la la, can't let it stress me
(Bands)
Wake up, fall asleep to Dizzy Gillespie (bands)
Ba-back it up and break it down (bands)
She gon' bust it on this dick you gon' take her out of town (bands)
I put ice in my veneers, I put rubies in my crown (bands)
Count them stacks and blow them racks, niggas know who they around
You might also like
I got bands (alright, I got bands)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow (blow)
Nigga, I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bands (la la) (alright, I got bands)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow (la la)
Nigga, I got bands (la la) (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure (la la)
I got bands
Okay, I walk in this bitch I fuck shit up then I leave, ho (bands)
Pay your car note or get some money for that weed, ho (bands)
Forty-five hundred, blow it, there go double C's, ho (bands)
Might go throw a birkin bag if you tell me please, ho (bands)
She gon' throw that ass back, drop that on them real niggas (bands)
I'm gon' throw that cash back, drop that on the real bitches (bands)
Murder on that pussy, ho, I kill, I-I kill bitches
(ban—, ban—, bands, bands)
You gon' get like every bag and every shoe if I deal with you (bands)
Young nigga ballin' like I fuckin' hit the lottery (bands)
You just want the money shorty, you ain't got to lie to me (bands)
All these niggas hatin' on me, know they wanna body me (bands)
'Cause every time you see a nigga, I look like a robbery
Blow

Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure

Lately, I been goin' crazy
Laughin', drinkin', find myself in arms of different women, huh
Toast it, I need to use my cerebellum
Tried to tell 'em cut that rap shit all that wack shit is underwhelming
Time's ticking, palms itching
Minds tripping, tired of living, mad decisions, I'll kill 'em
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands

I got bands (alright, I got bands)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bands (la la) (alright, I got bands)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow (la la)
Nigga, I got bands (la la) (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure (la la)
I got bands (la la)28Embed
