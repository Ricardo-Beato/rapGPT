4 ContributorsBreak of Dawn LyricsI've seen so many things
On the streets you feel like nothing
Low and behold
It's the greatest story ever told
In the dark I roll
Never sell my soul
Just keep pushin' on and on and on
I'll never stop 'till the break of fucking dawn
Just keep pushin' on and on and on
I'll never stop 'till the break of fucking dawn
The Rolls long
Stay strong
Hold on
'Cause I won't stop 'till the break of fucking dawn
Started in '91
The high and mighty ones
Big guns, tiny ones
A block of ninety sons
Holdin' a nine and sum
Wildin' out on the corner
On the Terra blocks
Hidin' out
Vibin' out
We never cry about
What we don't have
We go get it
Live and die
Laugh and cry
That's how we livin'
In the hardest times
We write the hardest lines
Never were blind
To the crime
For nickels and dimes
You might also likeWhen the soul is heavy you can feel it baring down
Yeah, be careful what you wishin'
Heavy lies the crown
When you coming up from nothing, no one be around
When it's time for coronation yeah they held you down
You can play that role
You would sell your soul
I will dig your hole
Put you in it - go
When they ask about you
We don't know
I will dig your hole
(Yo)
Low and behold
It's the greatest story ever told
In the dark I roll
Never sell my soul
Just keep pushin' on and on and on
I'll never stop 'till the break of fucking dawn
Just keep pushin' on and on and on
I'll never stop 'till the break of fucking dawn
The Rolls long
Stay strong
Hold on
'Cause I won't stop 'till the break of fucking dawn
Innovators over imitators
If you really got the hustle you gon' get the paper
Cypress black burnin' tracks like incinerators
Bring the stacks for the pack, you can taste the flavor
In all black coming through like the rainers out the tunnel
In the way we gonna rush you, all bite no bustle
Bring the bikes out the huddle
We take off like shuttle
I fall for subtle, yeah my niggas tryna Bumble
Bringing trouble to a city near you
Switching lanes on these lanes
Leave them in the rearview
Because we live this life
Watch me rip this mic
'Bout to kill this show
Too much shit behind
All this weed I smoke
All the sacrifice
All the sleepless nights
I know I don't get trife
So every time Imma bring it to your doorstep
Ready for war more or less
Low and behold
It's the greatest story ever told
In the dark I roll
Never sell my soul
Just keep pushin' on and on and on
I'll never stop 'till the break of fucking dawn
Just keep pushin' on and on and on
I'll never stop 'till the break of fucking dawn
The Rolls long
Stay strong
Hold on
'Cause I won't stop 'till the break of fucking dawnEmbed
