5 ContributorsThe Way it’s Goin’ Down Lyrics
Hit me, baby (That's right)
Uh, a-hurt me, baby (That's right), that-that-that-that funk
That-that-that (That's right), that-that
That-that's-that's that funkdafied-like funk (That's right)
That's that retarded-like (That's right) funk
Like you put your armpits on the drum machine (That's right), good God
Break me off some of that, come on (That's right)

Easy Mo, just let the beat rock from your sweet stock
To bounce the complete block, make everyone on the street flock
To this here rhythm, music'll hit 'em, get 'em, my lyrics'll fit 'em
When I get with 'em, they'll admit I'm smokin' like bags of ism
The way that I keep amazin' y''all, don't even know who you're facin', pa
The Kane has flipped more tracks than a racing car
The one who created it, many others imitated it
I heard your rap style, kid, I hated it
Let me show you how, look here, now check my style, what I spit out
It'll raise your brow, make you say wow, ba-da-bow-bow, come on now, let's get down
And sway this way when you hear the music play
Hip-hop hooray, this is what I want you to say, hey

I'm in love with Big Daddy Kane (Uh-huh)
He makes the party swing (Yes, sir)
He turns the mother out (Mhm)
And rips apart things (Then I go)
You might also like
Da-da-da, da-da
Yeah, I like the way it sound and I love the way it's goin' down
Da-da-da, da-da
You know I like the way it sound and I just love the way it's goin' down

Now, what's this BS you're sayin'?
And don't try to act like Martin now, with all that "I was just playin'"
No need to grief or mourn, 'cause now, the beef is on
Boom-bap, boo-bow-bow, kid, your teeth is gone
Just 'cause you rap, that don't mean that ya catchin' wreck with me
You step to this, I give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one person that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle, 'cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle? I gots to have it
Unless you're gonna rob me like they did Whittaker when he fought Chavez
'Cause tryin' to go against the Kane rappin'
Is like a pimp tryna pull a nun, ain't nothin' happenin'
Clear the way for the one champion, true Black don who begun gettin' the job done
Take a look, hon, back up, son, you know you can't get none
Come on, I'm on a whole 'nother level of rap
And it's like that, now show me where the party at, uh-huh

Da-da-da, da-da
Yeah, I like the way it sound and I love the way it's goin' down
Da-da-da, da-da
You know I like the way it sound and I love how it's goin' down
The B-I-G D-A-D-Y, no, back up and add another D
Then back to the K to the A to the N to the E
Live from New York, the one and only
I give it to you raw for my homies, uh, and to the ladies
I take 'em lookin' somethin' fine and don't mind
If we bump and grind, if you're with me, jump in line, because
If in my wallet I can find one prophylactic
Then you better believe, girl, that you gonna get your ass dicked
Hard type of rappers extinct like a dinosaur
The kind you saw the rhyme before, but now you never find no more
Steppin' to the Kane with some drama to be startin'
Because I put 'em all on ice like Tonya Harding
Back up, boy, I got the whole convoy
Rollin' with me on a mission that's to seek and destroy
So, to all the people that's been tryin' to talk about me
You better change your name to 5000, 'cause you're Audi
And if you bring on your crew, I'm steppin' to them too
Just put the beat on and watch how I swim through the groove
With more style than a backstroke
Drivin' past my competition like cab drivers do Black folks
That's the way I move, I always stay the smooth
Operator with data watin' for you to play a groove
To turn it out without a doubt and show what I'm about
Good lookin, Brooklyn, yeah, we in the house, shamon
Da-da-da, da-da
Yeah, I like the way it sound and I love the way it's goin' down
Da-da-da, da-da
You know I like the way it sound and I just love the way it's goin' down

That's right
That's right
That's rightEmbed
