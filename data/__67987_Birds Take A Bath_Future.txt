32 ContributorsBirds Take A Bath Lyrics
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath

They come out Charlie Sheen (winning)
They come out coupe machines
They shoulda came with wings
How they flying in
Man I'm on that lean
In the house with green
In the house with yay
Man we need a mask
All these dope fumes (don't sniff)
While we count this cash
Straight drop class
Put it in a freezer
Put it on a block, give them J's a teaser
They gave my dope a name
They call this dope diesel
You need some gambino
You be fly like a eagle
We move them bands like cheetah
Get you a egg beater
And a half a square
Whip you a brick fair
You might also like
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath

I mean some birds in the shower dawg
Pass me the bounty dawg
Quick picker upper
Look at this motherfucker
His rhyme is a paper plate
I chop 'em like paper steaks
My life is a marathon
Cause I'm on the paper chase
My dog caught a paper case
He had too much paper on him
He said it was routine
I said they was waiting on him
Them fed they just chase the sack
Them J they just taste the crack
These dumb niggas chasing hoes
And me I'm chasing racks
Cause we offer fifty sacs
Fuck up bout thirty racks
Go drop me twelve bars
And get that there right back
My aunty say what's that smell
She said it is smellin' sour
I find it hard to believe
I just got 'em out the shower
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath

I just want the birds off
They cut all my phones off
They know how to clean them up
Got falcons and eagles nigga
The stash I was passing
Cook house with six kitchens
You know I got birds nigga
I get them for zeros
Clean them with remix
The bird bought me everything
The bird bought me diamond chain
Got bricks call me bird man
She bring me a cash money
Like Nipsey and Marathon
Yeah I'm on juuga-thon
I can't stop counting up
Them birds come every day
Plus I see them everywhere
Just send me a stork nigga
Get him the next day
Birds take a bath
I put em right on the express way
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath, watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath5Embed
