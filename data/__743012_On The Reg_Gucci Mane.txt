5 ContributorsOn The Reg Lyrics
On the regular
Cause I'm not regular
This beat ain't regular
My style ain't (regular)

Walk in Magic City on the motherfucking regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
I throw up money, King of Diamonds, Monday on the regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
Jamaican Kush I'm rolling up, cause I don't fuck with regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
Import my hoes from overseas, cause all my hoes ain't regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)

None of my hoes regular, all my hoes superb
Absurd with these nouns and verbs
I be choosing words that ain't words
That seem crazy to you, but it still appeal
My dog, you got thirty years and he gon' appeal
I don't need a deal, cause I cash out on the regular
I don't do no debit cards, I don't fuck with creditors
All I do is talk money, cause Gucci got et cetera
Killed all my competitors, so ain't nobody better, bruh
Baby girl ain't regular, a normal nigga's scared of her
But everything I do is abnormal, my life is spectacular
Don't know what attracted her, but I got a bachelor pad
And I got your girlfriend, cause you laying down, I beat it up
You might also like
Walk in Magic City on the motherfucking regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
I throw up money, King of Diamonds, Monday on the regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
Jamaican Kush I'm rolling up, cause I don't fuck with regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
Import my hoes from overseas, cause all my hoes ain't regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)

Gucci Mane la flair, extra-ordinaire player
Leave you choosing like a bear
At the fucking county fair
I swear that it ain't fair, cause I know that he a square
When he don't take you places, baby I can take you there
And I know you not prepared when I pull up in the rare
Car that comes from a whole nother hemisphere
Now let's get it clear, all these diamonds in my ear
Make it hard for me to steer when you're kissing down there
I had a blast last night, I had to tip the driver
Cause the shit he seen last night could have been on MacGuyver
Doors suicidal, so that shit was homicidal
You never seen the ghost? I guess you never seen me riding

Walk in Magic City on the motherfucking regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
I throw up money, King of Diamonds, Monday on the regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
Jamaican Kush I'm rolling up, cause I don't fuck with regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
Import my hoes from overseas, cause all my hoes ain't regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
She can't fit in my schedule
Because that shit she got ain't special, bruh
I guess it's kind of scary to her
Because that shit I do ain't usual
Yeah, I smash her on the casual
My money make me more attractable
But this shit ain't nothing non-negotiable
This Bricksquad crew and we ain't sociable
She wanna elope. No! I'm dragging my foot, bro
Who say I'm not a heart breaker telling a sad joke?
Ain't regular, no way, I'm tipping the valet
I need some green cards, immigrants in my driveway

Walk in Magic City on the motherfucking regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
I throw up money, King of Diamonds, Monday on the regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
Jamaican Kush I'm rolling up, cause I don't fuck with regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)
Import my hoes from overseas, cause all my hoes ain't regular
(Regular, Regular, Regular, Regular)Embed
