48 ContributorsParty All the Time Lyrics
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh

Always wanna go
Always tell her yes, never tell her no
Know you think you know everything, but you don't
Wanna do the right thing, but you probably won't
So you chase the nightlife, blinded by the lights
Bottom of the empty glass where you find life
Always left behind because she think she right
Thinkin' that she grown, but always need your advice
And always in a situation that she need your help
But wouldn't help another, only care about herself
In the VIP askin', "Where the drink at?"
Calling her a groupie, you think she really think that?
She just wanna hear that that ass look right
What you doin' after this? Fuck tomorrow night
Wanna snort some blow? Pop a lot of pills?
Fuckin' when the sun come up, she don't feel

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time

Skip semester, classes've passed
Say she goin' back, but she ain't goin' back
'Cause time ain't waitin' for a future on hold
At glass tables, on her knees sniffin' coke
Tell her get a hold, grip on life
Rather fill her cup up, liquor with no ice
Twice had an abortion, young, dumb and scorchin'
Rate that she goin', she might be whorin'
Signs she ignorin', but doesn't recognize
Blind to what's occurrin', what's goin' in your mind?
Seven days a week, same shit every morning
Callin' her a cab from different niggas' apartments
Wantin' her to change, but she won't, dog
Just another number in her fuckin' call log
Lost in the fog, head in the smoke
Laughin' at the world 'cause her life is a joke

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time15Embed
