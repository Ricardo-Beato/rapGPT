Ayo
Ayo
Ayo, ah
Ayo, ah
Ayo
Ayo
Ayo, ah
Yeah

I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob? Who you had to fuck
Just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money; escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear - goin' broke, 'cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't trippin'
Nigga Jordan, I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slippin', tears
Blood, sweat, and I ain't crippin', here's
A song you can sing along wit'
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home 'cause she got a second job
Deliverin' pizzas, you think she out there gettin' robbed
Please God, watch her, I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talkin' all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg
I'm a grown man now, I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty, now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writin' rhymes, try and bring back the hope
Tried to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Coulda drowned, but I grabbed the rope
You might also like
And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Sellin' me dreams and tellin' me things you knew
And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Sellin' me dreams and tellin' me things you knew
Sing

You got what I want
I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want
I got what you need (Yeah)
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?" (Yeah)
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But e'ry fuckin' verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit, you try switch now
Know you felt the shit just now
Know you felt the shit just now, ha
Ain't there more to you?
Don't it ever get borin' to you?
I realize deep down you a coward gettin' high off of power
Fuck it more to you, saw through you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect, but it came with fame
I just wanted love, but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane and watched lil Jermaine
Do his thang before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat, he gave it all he got
And now the nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be rainin' in
Spend a hundred thou' for the chain again
Think of old-school niggas like Dana Dane
Prolly kill for another claim to fame, my brain just sayin'
"Yeah, nigga, least he ain't insane
Least he ain't insane"
You ain't crazy, ma'fucker, you just 'fraid of change, ayy
That's new
Maybe that's true
But listen here, I got a bigger fear:
One day that I become you when I become lost
And I become heartless
And numb from all the m√©nages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now, I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
'Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme, I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you
There go you
There go you
Sellin' me dreams and tellin' me things you knew
And there go you
And there go you
And there go you
Sellin' me dreams and tellin' me things you knew
Sing

You got what I want
I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want
I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"218Embed
