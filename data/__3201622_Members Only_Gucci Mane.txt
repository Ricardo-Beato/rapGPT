Wizop

Fresher than a bitch
Hit the mall for the fit
And we fucking standing up
I'm standing tall in your bitch
I send them bullets at you nigga
I John Wall at your clique
When them shooters get them (pew pew)
Niggas calling the quits
Niggas running ducking falling and shit
Dont get involved with this shit
Because we all with this shit
Well I'm ballin' I'm super lit
My net worth, I quadrupled it
This groupie chick so super thick
I might buy her new Louboutins
Ludacris, never sold dope I did it was lucrative
All these P's, I'm cooking in
I never be broke again
It's a lot of youngins tryna live the life that Gucci live
They ain't beat that murder charge or killed them folks that Gucci killed

This for killers only, yeah this for the homies
Drug dealers only, yeah this members only
Trap niggas only yeah rich niggas only
Bad bitches only, yeah this for the homies
This for killers only yeah this for the homies
Drug dealers only, yeah this members only
Trap niggas only yeah rich niggas only
Bad bitches only yeah this for the homies

Pulled up on Peters Street stash box, that's where my heater be
My car got shipped from Germany
My clothes was shipped from Italy
Niggas envious they ridiculed and belittled me
I was too generous, now I have no sympathy
I just built a mansion, solid gold on my amenities
Holmes he not no street nigga get him out the vicinity
I just bought a Phantom and put wood on the extremities
Man that bitch ain't bad enough get her out this facility
Wake up every morning grinding like I'm hungry
Homeless and lonely coz I really want it
Hold up Gucci Mane run them bands up
But fuck that, this a stick up put your hands up

This for killers only, yeah this for the homies
Drug dealers only, yeah this members only
Trap niggas only, yeah rich niggas only
Bad bitches only, yeah this for the homies
This for killers only, yeah this for the homies
Drug dealers only, yeah this members only
Trap niggas only, yeah rich niggas only
Bad bitches only, yeah this for the homies7Embed
