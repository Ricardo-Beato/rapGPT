11 ContributorsSexy Bitch Lyrics
Da da da da
Once upon a time for the minute by the shape of the hour
The unify finds divide in the power-U
He talk us in and to work its way in and devour you whole
We all know the power do
Damsel in distress she's not
She lay a muzzle on a jigzaw puzzle
Meaning she's a straight shooter
Shoot it straight in your vein
Leave your heart all tattered up
Own the blame
She lives by the name of a sexy bitch
The scratch to my itch, touch capability
Angelic lips, devilish hips
That manage to make a sandwich of a power utility
You feeling me?

Ey yo yo, what's up lady? what up?
Ey yo, come here for a minute, come here
Oh, you ain't gonna stop for me? Word? Bitch!
- Should have never did that, at least not to this one
Man that bitch wasn't even trying to holla at me
- It don't work that way, baby
I mean, I look good man
Man, that ass fat
- You just can't look so dusty
What?
- In my days you gotta be versatile, you know
Versatile, huh? So what do you suggest I do next time, old man?
- Don't even look, don't waste your time, babyYou might also likeEmbed
