17 ContributorsSOB Lyrics
Just riding around in a convertible Corolla
Waiting for the light to change, hopefully my luck will change
Went to sleep pissed off, woke up broke as fuck again
Being mediocre is some shit I'll never understand
Never had a 9 to 5, never did an application
And rather rob a nigga, when I get the chance, teacher's tell you
"Get a plan, go to college, let them empty out your pockets"
What the fuck I look like, nigga? For real
It's safe to say I put my heart in the trap but
How in the hell could you fault me for that when
It takes money to be shit and we never seen it
So I'm doing dirt, let the police clean it
Standing on the edge of a tall cliff
Trying not to fall deep into the shark pit
I guess I'm God's gift to Hell in a funny way
Can't wait to see my life change once the money came

Niggas only come around when the money's 'round
Catch you slipping 'round the town just to gun you down
Wasn't fucking with me then but I bet by now
These mothafuckas know they like my style
Tryna figure out, What the hell they want from me
Why I love everything that involves money?
Hope I get enough just tryna live it up
Shit I want yours too, you should give it up
You might also like
She said she like money, I like Hummer's, you want to trade?
Just another disappointment in my fucking day
Slave to my lifestyle, would try and make a change
But I heard about the shit they doing to the runaway's
Swear that I would change everything if my gun could stay
Said she doesn't understand, anything I fucking say
Problems with women, she's tripping but get's pissed
Cause I tell that she just a bitch, and never really meant much
But if I told you that I loved you would you give a fuck?
Or even have the decency to listen up? Probably not
I swear like every time you come around my fucking heart will stop
Can't wait 'til I make way and the talking stops
But for now I just stare you down in the parking lot
From a far distance, just hoping, just wishing
That maybe you might not think I'm crazy
I know you probably wish for the same thing but fuck it
