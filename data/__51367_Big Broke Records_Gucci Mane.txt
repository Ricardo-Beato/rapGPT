13 ContributorsBig Broke Records Lyrics
You big cat
You big pussy
I got big dough, we sell big kushy
You fat fucker
You fucking moulie
You big piece of shit
You tried to trick the Gucci
I fucked your girl (I fucked her)
While you was gone (I did it)
Then fucked your girl (damn)
While you was home (again)
She's home alone
She call my phone
She gave me dome
Won't leave me lone
I know all ya business, and all ya spots
Know how you move, let's fire some shots
You know all my business, and all my spots
You know how I move
Lets fire some shots
I came to this fat fuck chained up
Ranged up gangbang nigga I was flamed up
Big Broke Records
Bankrupt Records
If I wasn't trappin' I would be special
Gucci like to shoot
Gucci like to murk
Cat snitched got 14 months damn (true)
Mella yes man (true)
Sucking Cat's dick (true)
Big Cat Ms. Davenport
Can join the list (so)
She another black bitch (so)
Ain't worth 2 cents (true)
Now ya'll mad that ya'll broke and I'm rich
And ya'll ain't worth 3 cents
Just like shawty shoot the studio up
