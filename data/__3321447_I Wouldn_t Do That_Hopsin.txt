30 ContributorsI Wouldn’t Do That Lyrics
Yikes, I'm in my zone
Get on my level, I'm wildin' out, move back
Get off of me, I am the prodigy
I feel like I am a new man
I really don't see any areas in this shit I should improve at
So who tryna wake up the dragon? You?
Nah, I wouldn't do that

Okay, alright
It's about to go down
It's about to go down
It's about to go down
It's about to go down, nigga
Yeah, okay (Prodigy)
Check me out, look!

Oh, shit who's that?
I'm the rapper lunatic who comin' at you like a locomotive
I been down, now I'm up
Hop solo, nigga damn, it's like my life is like a rollercoaster
Your flow the coldest? Well I flow below it
You know I'm bloated from eating so many niggas
Ah, hold on a moment!
Homie, I don't need a major label
I'm at home with twitter fingers whippin' up my own promotions
Rap monster, Black Mamba
You can't run from the wrath I've been asked to cast on ya
To all the haters who been keepin' up with my every move
Here's my penis to latch on ya (catch!)
I'm the only MC in this wack genre (bitch!)
Don't look at me, I'ma spaz on ya
Kids, go get the key to your dad's Honda and turn up
Roll up the street and you pass ganja (are you serious?)
I came up with a couple new answers (what's that?)
I'ma need a couple new dance singles (nigga what?)
'Cause I done made a whole lot of money
But I'm feelin' blue still, I ain't talkin' Zoolander
I was Hugh Heff'in on the low
When my girl found out, she was like, "You bastard!
It's so obvious you never even loved me
You stupid ugly motherfucker, fuck you and her!"
Fame's a web and I'm caught between it
Walk and breathe it, cool thing and it's all convenient
Hoes beggin' me to sign all across the cleavage
Nigga, you should hear the tone that they talk to me with
I'd be stupid if I don't fill 'em all with semen (true)
I don't know where to go with these darker demons (true)
I've been on the phone tryna talk to Jesus (true)
I am on a roll, and can y'all believe it? Alright
You might also like
Yeah, I'm in my zone
Get on my level, I'm wildin' out, move back
Bitch, get off of me, I am the prodigy
I feel like I am a new man
I really don't see any areas in this shit I should improve at
So who tryna wake up the dragon? You?
Nah, I wouldn't do that

Nope, nu uh, sorry
I wouldn't do that
Come on, what? Are you serious?
I wouldn't do that
This guy, really? Fuck are you doin'?
I wouldn't do that
Look buddy, I get it, I know! It's not gonna work
I wouldn't do that

I got a story and I hope it unfolds (yeah)
Undercover Prodigy, I won't become broke (yeah)
Nobody fuckin' with me and both of us know
Y'all two week hyped like Pokémon GO
You don't see it, homie, then you smokin' on dope
Got MC's hemmed up, chokin' on rope (so?)
Haters keep talkin' but doin' nothin' about it
As I let my nuts hang while I'm holdin' on both
I been on one, charged up like protons
I'm so gone, it's goin' down like nose runs, nigga
Collectin' mo' funds like bank robbers who tote guns
It's so fun, look at the hoes come, nigga
Step aside, allow me to prepare for my finale
It's grind time around me (yup)
Damn, Hopsin, you tight, no doubt B
Back at it again with the white Janoski
Look, I ain't innocent, I stay killin' shit
Rape sentences and shake witnesses, I'm an insane menace
Vacate the day premises, my brain's missin'
I date women for eight minutes then play 'em like Seg' Genesis
Straight nigga, but shit, it's too late to take Ritalin
And doctors, they've been itchin' for days to make sense of it
If I'm around, no such thing as a safe citizen
When I'm on the mic I deliver like St. Nicholas
Niggas get in shivers the moment the bass tricklin'
You can see I'm not in the mood to play, gentlemen
Forever ill is somethin' you can't fiddle with
You ain't got the balls to hang, okay little dick?
Niggas, I'm God, I'm a numskull
If you don't like me, what the fuck did you come for?
If anybody sayin' I'm not raw
Just tell 'em one thing: I got bars, nigga
Yeah, I'm in my zone
Get on my level, I'm wildin' out, move back
Bitch, get off of me, I am the prodigy
I feel like I am a new man
I really don't see any areas in this shit I should improve at
So who tryna wake up the dragon? You?
Nah, I wouldn't do that

Nope, nu uh, sorry
I wouldn't do that
Come on, what? Are you serious?
I wouldn't do that
This guy, really? Fuck are you doing?
I wouldn't do that
Look buddy, I get it, I know! It's not gonna work
I wouldn't do that5Embed
