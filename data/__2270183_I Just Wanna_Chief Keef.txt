45 ContributorsI Just Wanna Lyrics
(GGP)
These bitches want my money, I won't give it
These bitches is fronting, they just want your money
(Chopsquad)
Yeah, I see you bitches on the come up (I see ya)
I see these bitches on the come up (I see ya)
See these bitches on the come up
Always into something crazy
Uh-uh, don't care who you fucking lately

Damn baby, when I walked in the room I know you noticed it
Damn baby, I know you smell this loud when I start rolling it
Blowing it, all I wanna get money and smoke marijuana
All I want to, smoke some weed and get some commas
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
Baby, I just wanna get cheese and smoke green with my guys
I'm on a green diet, I don't want no french fries

I just wanna get by, I just wanna get high
I just wanna get cake, I just wanna get pie
I just wanna live my life, I just wanna rock my ice
I just wanna fucking shine, I be glowing all the time
Smoking ganja, counting commas
Fucking thotties, I probably fucked yo momma
Rolling with my gunners, my gunners, they'll gun ya
If your dumb ass try running, then them bullets run for ya
'Cause I be minding my business, I love money and THC
Who the fuck just hopped out with that rock on? That's Keef Jay-Z
Me baby, all I know is eat baby, all I know is eat baby
All I know is top baby, all I know is freak baby
Now what you wanna? What you tryna do baby?
Say you coming through, who with you?
Okay cool baby, it's cool baby
It's me and my jewels and the crew baby, and the goo baby
You was talking nonsense, I was through baby
I hop in, then my car vroom, vroom baby, you crazy
You might also like
Damn baby, when I walked in the room I know you noticed it
Damn baby, I know you smell this loud when I start rolling it
Blowing it, all I wanna get money and smoke marijuana
All I want to, smoke some weed and get some commas
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
Baby, I just wanna get cheese and smoke green with my guys
I'm on a green diet, I don't want no french fries

Yeah, it's just me, myself and money (All this money)
Don't need nothing else
I don't need nobody (Need nobody)
Don't even trust myself
Swear I need some fucking help
Doing drugs to numb myself
Rolling blunts and popping pills
That Molotov the bomb for real
I'm nodding off, unconscious
Wake up nauseous, god damn alcoholic
Pulling ten grand out my wallet
Know they 'bout to judge me
I been sitting at the crib, I'm sick of counting money
Yeah, I'm bored of being rich as fuck, tried every single drug
It's not exciting anymore once that first million come
I got my business up, now I just don't give a fuck
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
I-I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna

I just wanna
Get faded every day of my life
Getting laid every night, like
I just wanna
Sip liquor, I'm a sinner
Take a picture, remember tonight
I just wanna 'nother car
I just wanna A couple bars
I just wanna get faded, what's a man to the greatest?
I don't care who the fuck you are
I still ride around with
Every single motherfucking homie I been down with
It keep me grounded, smoking on the loudest
Neighbors telling us to turn it down
Shut your mouth, bitch
Shut your, shut your mouth, bitch
I just bought two houses
Just spent two years of your salary on this outfit
Ain't no way around it
On the phone with my accountant (Hey)
It feels good to be this wealthy and well rounded
We got you surrounded
Ganja, counting commas
Fucking thotties, I probably fucked your momma
Rolling with my gunners, my gunners, they'll gun ya
If your dumbass try running, then them bullets run for ya
'Cause I-I-I-I-I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wannam I just wanna12Embed
