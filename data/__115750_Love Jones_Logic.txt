34 ContributorsLove Jones Lyrics
Most living the life that I'm living
Is driven by money and women
But you're all I ever need girl that's a given, feel me
Now sick as fuck just heal me
My heart broken can you seal me
Baby I'm knowing that our love is ever-growing
Which direction are we going
I think we should get to slowing it down
The only girl that make me smile when I frown now
Re-interrupt but we can fix it though I wonder how
All I know is I miss the way you smile

It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight

Now I ain't ever treat you like you was less than nothing
And I ain't ever beat you unless we talking fuckin'
So meet me halfway baby girl tell me something
You left me in the dark I pray to god the sun coming
Now its been a couple years many fears is what I face
But all that disappears when I look upon your grace
We ain't spoken for days so I guess you needed space
Did you need some time to mentally erase
The fact that I'm the only man that put a smile on your face
See when you do not talk to me my mind it just wanders
I swear to god I trust you but alone I start to ponder
I swear I treat you good, I swear I treat you right
But sometimes I do not listen that's the reason why we fight
You might also like
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight

Now you got me feeling like I'm fuckin' mental
Won't speak to me so Imma speak up to this instrumental
This ain't the dog house shorty got me in the kennel
Now, what did I do? What mistake did I make?
See shall we persevere forward with it or make a clean break
Since the first day we met we both knew it was fate
So baby girl I guess you needed some time
But I put effort into you like I put effort in my rhymes
Now that's on everything, my best friend I tell you anything
Give you the world plus some kids pick out any ring
So know I'm down especially when we up
Half empty, half fullâ€”fuck a cup, she my waterfall
This song is just for her fuck all of y'all
Ain't looking for no Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson
I'm looking for the girl that always thought I was handsome
Before the money and some, chillin' and dirty dancing
High price hotels flower pedals romancing now
Every now and then emotions they can shift
But all of this means nothing with no one to share it with
I said every now and then emotions they can shift
But all of this means nothing with no one to share it with
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact I think about you every single night
It's not about who wrong its not about who right
It's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight8Embed
