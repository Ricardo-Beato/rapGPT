41 ContributorsShooter Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, haha
Weezy Baby, y'all (Yeah)
Don't get shot
Rapid fire, what you know 'bout it?
I brought my homie along for the ride
He strapped, he came ready to come out the barrel
Rob

I heard some shouts, like, "Down on the floor" (Baow)
Then even louder, "We got shooters" (Yeah), shooters (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
I turned around, I was starin' at chrome (Hello)
Shotgun watches door, got security good (Check)
Jumped right over counter, pointed gun at, wink
He tell her, "I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter" (Let's go)

My hands up (Yeah), my hands up (Yeah)
They want me with my hands up (I think they), no (Think they want me)
Shooter (Surrender to 'em, but no, no, no, I can't do it)
My hands up, my hands up (Yeah)
They want me with my hands up (Come on, they want me to), no (Surrender)
Shooter (But no, I can't do it, get 'em, yeah)

So many doubt 'cause I come from the South
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out, bang
Die, bitch nigga, die, I hope you bleed a lake
I'ma play X-ray, helpin' y'all see the fake
I'm just tryna be the great, tryna get a piece of cake
Take it off of your plate, eat it right in your face (Hah)
They got a whole lot to say, but I don't listen
Call me Automatic Weezy, bitch, I keep spittin', pow
You might also like
With all these riches and all these riches (Yeah)
But ain't no loaners around (What you say?)
They thinkin' 'bout shooters, they, shooters, they (Okay)
Guns, girls (Okay), ladies, get the guns (Okay), get the
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shooters (Okay, come on)

My hands up
They want me with my hands up, no (I think they want me to surrender)
Shooter (Clap, y'all, no, no, but I'm not)
I just cry, "Mama, I tink dat," hey
"Me tink they want me to surrender"
Shooter (No, no, bang)

And to the radio stations, I'm tired of bein' patient
Stop being rapper racists, region haters
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick takers, it's outrageous
You don't know how sick you make us
I wanna throw it up like chips in Vegas
But this is Southern, face it
If we too simple, then y'all don't get the basics

Lady walks into a shotgun surprise (Yeah)
Dropped to her knees, saw her life 'fore her eyes (Okay)
He said, "Bitch is gonna get it, everybody gon' regret it" (Okay, why?)
"I'm your shooter" (Brrt)
My hands up (Yeah), my hands up (Yeah)
They want me with my hands up, no (Yeah, hah)
Shooter (I tried tell you what I am, baby)
My hands up (Yeah), my hands up (Yeah)
They want me with my hands up, no (Sorry, but me can't surrender, me won't surrender)
Shooter (Me no pretender, no)

Socks soakin' wet, I been running, y'all, I reload
Every hundred yards, I'm comin' forward
You better know me
Lil Wayne, just call me Lord, hard
Take pain like Tylenols, raw
Way past par, far
I'm some shit you never saw
I take you to the shootout, baby, win, lose, or draw, yeah
And then they ask who, when, where, how, and
My reply was simply, "Pow," c'mon

Mama, I tink dat, hey
Me tink dey want me to surrender
No, no, I'm sayin'
Mama, I tink dat, hey
Me tink dey want me to surrender, no
No, no, me won't surrender, no
No, I promise no surrender
I got my burner
And I'm the shooter7Embed
