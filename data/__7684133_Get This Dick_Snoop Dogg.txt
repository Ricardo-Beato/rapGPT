Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Settle down, d-d-down, d-d-down
Ooh, oh-oh-oh
So won't you come on over and get this dick

Whenever you need it (Need it)
I'll be there to beat it (Beat it)
Don't you worry
Come on over and get this dick
It's not hard to find it (Find it)
When you could stop all your grinding
I'll be there
So won't you come on over and get this dick

Early morning, turkey bacon on the wake up (Yeah)
Cheese with them grits, them tits, watching you shake 'em (Oh yeah)
You thick as oatmeal, I'm a ready to quaker (Come on)
Oats, but first let me smoke
Wanna hit this?
You fuckin' with me 'cause you know I keep that Bisquick
Strokе a pole while I roll up, "Baby, lick this"
Work it out, big fitness
Got mе yelling, "Lord, can I get a, can I get a witness?"
Hole in your cup, let me stir it softly
Come and be the kush to a nigga coffee
You fiending for the nine, let me Nina Ross you
Yeah, how you like me now?
You make it, make it messy
Then you quick to wipe me down
Top it off with head
I ain't king without my crown (Ooh)
Poppin' like it's grease
Yeah, I'm loving every sound
Drop it like it's hot 'til I'm back around
You might also like
Whenever you need it (Need it)
I'll be there to beat it (Beat it)
Don't you worry
Come on over and get this dick
It's not hard to find it (Find it)
When you could stop all your grinding
I'll be there
So won't you come on over and get this dick

Middle of the day, a boss stay in the hunch (Ah)
She feigning for this brunch, it's too early for lunch (Yeah)
Chicken and some eggs, your legs, watching them spread
You need it right now, I love watching you beg (Ooh)
Macaroni pasta, sausage with the lobster
She love fuckin' on the mobster with a monster (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm more of a doctor then a sponsor
Fix whatever you need and then I'm out (La, la, la, la)
The deezo, mid-day swinign' it like a kilo
Snoop, Billy Dee mixed with D-Lo
'Cause I don't give a fuck about a easel but I keep a 4-five (What?)
A lover and a friend, I can be both sides
If ya, if ya, if ya need that (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No frontin', I like hittin' it from the bizack
Now let me do ya how I do ya, then I send you on your way
Handle business then get back to the play (Okay)
Whenever you need it (Need it)
I'll be there to beat it (Beat it)
Don't you worry (Don't worry)
Come on over and get this dick
It's not hard to find it (Find it)
When you could stop all your grinding (No, no, no)
I'll be there
So won't you come on over and get this dick
Whenever you need it (Whenever you)
I'll be there to beat it (Beat it)
Don't you worry (D-d-don't, d-d-don't worry)
Come on over and get this dick
It's not hard to find it (Find it)
When you could stop all your grinding (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be there
So won't you come on over and get this dick

Okay baby, now it's dinner time
AKA let me get back, get back in it time (In it time)
Before the soul food come, have a sip of wine
Tequila shots with a hint of lime
No swine, so fine (Ooh yeah)
You walk, step to the stage, you get it, why?
You love the sound, you get louder than crowds
When I'm crowding up in your other space
Stop it girl, you makin' me make that other face (Ooh-ooh)
Get that ass above the face
While you wait (While you wait)
You're hot off the plate, I gotta taste
Grab your waist, drop ya face (No, no, no)
Boom, pow, you're done, I gotta shake
I got money to make, hold on
Say, baby, it's been real
But I got to go
I got places to be and people to see
Oh yeah, COD
