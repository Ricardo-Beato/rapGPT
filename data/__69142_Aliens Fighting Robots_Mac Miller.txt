79 ContributorsAliens Fighting Robots Lyrics
I think this is yours
Uh (Hahaha, hahaha)
That works too
Anyway
Guess who it is, everybody

Y'all is dead weight, less great, always gettin' second place
I tend to race ahead of pace, dippin' while I'm dressed in Bape
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't DiCaprio
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall
Capicola sandwiches are tasty from Primanti's
I'm a 5'7" giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls with makeup get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, 'cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feelin' like a hundred wars are goin' on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Actin' like you fuckin' with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe
You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do somethin' that ain't tangible
Now I'm 'bout to hand it to the homie Mikey (Michael) Rocks
Hear what he sayin' to you
You might also like
Take a trip, took a molly out with Banco Populari (Uh-huh)
The word round the city is he sit in a Ferrari (Yeah)
I told myself I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party 'til my Carties get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her lock, then lost the key (Lost it)
Weed smoke make it hard to see, we go harder than Carter one
Excuse me, baby, pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not sayin' it's comin' soon, but I want the real show (Real show)
Get me the treatment that you gettin' all the heels for (Heels for)
The shit they payin' all the bills for (Bills for)
Man, I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for by pictures
I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good), I'm peelin' bills, I'm real as hell
I don't front (Yeah), I roll blunts and papers
I don't fuck with fakers, your girl is askin' me if I'ma take her
I'm straight though, you see, I'm booked up 'til April
That's mine, that's me, I take those, you tryna see some pesos
Then shake though, you get exactly what you pay for
Stop actin' like you can't go, you swaggin' to the ankles
I feel you, baby, hopefully I look familiar, maybe

Fallin' down the same rabbit hole lookin' for love
But you will never ever get it, because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holdin' the drugs
And you can never ever see her, because
Life a clich√©, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land, and then the bags come
We walkin' on this planet, seekin' action
Break a girl's heart, sorry Ms. Jackson

Fallin' down the same rabbit hole lookin' for love
And you will never ever get it, because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holdin' the drugs
And you can never ever see her

And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top (Uh-huh)
I said it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top (Top)

Uh
Cheah
I'm so high, what you think about that, baby?
On some other shit that tend to make me act crazy
Fifteen thousand, blow it on clothes
Six in the mornin', still sittin' here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home
Buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home

Can I have some?6Embed
