30 ContributorsRamona Park Is Yankee Stadium Lyrics
New York, New York
Bright lights and dark skies
If I die today
Would you even know I existed?
Would you see my fate?
How I love you so
When you are so far away
You're in my skin, above my brim, and
If I shall pass away
New York, New York
Bright lights and dark skies
If I die today
Would you even know I existed?
Would you see my fate?
How I love you so
When you are so far away
You're in my skin, above my brim, and
If I shall pass away
