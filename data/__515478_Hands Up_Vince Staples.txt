50 ContributorsHands Up Lyrics
North Division tryin' to stop my blackness
I'm watchin' for them badges when out in traffic
Them 9-11's been a tad bit frantic
If lights start flashin', please don't panic
The DEA givin' out gang enhancements
Can barely even hang to build a case off cameras
CCAT trackin' criminal patterns
Trickin' niggas into takin' strikes to get out faster
Freedom bribery nigga, cause we hardly acquit
Social media that lead to flash photography snitchin'
Blame geography nigga, for the pride in these niggas
Take you when they fingerprint you, now you part of the system
This was all a part of Huey P. and Bobby prediction
Makin' profit off of violence, they arousin' attention
Leaders risin' lead to twenty-five to life in the prison
Better watch it cause I know they got a spot for you nigga

Yeah, put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air
Yeah, put your hands in the air
Yeah, put your hands in the air
Yeah, put your hands in the air
Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air

Deangelo Lopez and Tyler Woods
Just a couple they gunned down around the hood
I guess the pigs split wigs for the greater good
Cause I ain't seen them lock a swine up yet
At the most they reassign 'em to prevent protest
Just your color is enough to get you under arrest
Strong hand of the law got me feelin' oppressed
If you flippin', kill a fifty, then you get in a chair
Payin' taxes for some fuckin' clowns to ride around
Whoopin' niggas asses, scared to man up
Handcuffs givin' niggas gashes on the wrist
I used to lift my fist to fight the power with
Older homie told me in his day the pigs was plantin' bricks
In the trunks of nigga's Chevrolets them traffic stops and shit
Raidin' homes without a warrant, shoot him first without a warning
And they expect respect and non-violence, I refuse the right to be silent

Yeah, put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air
Yeah, put your hands in the air
Yeah, put your hands in the air
Yeah, put your hands in the air
Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air
LBPD, no they ain't 'bout shit
LAPD, no they ain't 'bout shit
LASD, no they ain't 'bout shit
Ridin' 'round these streets givin' out full clips
LBPD, no they ain't 'bout shit
LAPD, no they ain't 'bout shit
LASD, no they ain't 'bout shit
Ridin' 'round these streets givin' out full clips

Yeah, put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air
Yeah, put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
