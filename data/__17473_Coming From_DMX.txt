Believe me when I say
Before light, there was dark

Where you going, where you going?
Where you going, where you going?
Where you going?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?

Places that I've been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know it's only gonna get worse
Love, or a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it began
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end
Thin love, hold me down baby, it's gon' be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, 'cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, 'cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like "Oh, it's him again"
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine
Hot as you ever been, I was that in '89
Seek and you shall find, look within and you will know
Where you coming from, and where you gotta go
You might also likeCome on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-Gotta keep it real with me
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-So the hell with you
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-I think I'm going to the top
Me and DMX

I will spend mad time in one spot, plottin' my next move
Tryin' figure out - why is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered (why?), that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, cause they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the grime
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Lighter side of the dark, fight in the park but wouldn't wanna
Stayed and fought, but when they jumped me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it was a joke; I had the last laugh
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Come on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from
-If I don't know, I don't know
Where would I go?
-Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-Where we going, where we going, where we going?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-Where I'm going
Where would I go?
-But I know where I'm going
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-Do you know, do you know
Where would I go?
-I go, I go

I feel the ghost from within, comin' back to haunt me
Stay lovin' my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been gettin' love, but instead was plottin'
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special 'til this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the 4-4, leave 'em dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs that I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill 'em
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hatin', when I can show love
What's the sense of fakin', when I can show blood
Now what's the moral to this story?
Come on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-If I don't know, I don't know
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-I don't know
Where would I go?
-But I know where I'm coming from
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-Do you know where you're coming from?
Where would I go?

Yonkers is where we grew
Trials we got through
On top is where we stay
'Til the end, as long as we pray
P.K. in Swizz's place
Send tracks everyday
On Hot97 ya hear
DMX all through the year47Embed
