Ayy-oh-oh, ayy-oh-oh, ayy-oh-oh, oh-oh

I've been trying to steer, been trying to steer it right
It's apparently clear how I might be screwed
The end is near, said the end is nearing
It's apparently clear we might be screwed
When life loses appeal, when the ghosts appear
Just a kid in the moonlight, just a kid in the moonlight
Headlights on a deer, headlights on the fear
Just a kid in the moonlight

Rahm, rahm
Rahm, rahm (Hmm)
Rahm, rahm (Hmm)
Rahm, rahm (Hmm)
Rahm, rahm
Ayy-oh-oh, ayy-oh-oh, ayy-oh-oh, oh-ohYou might also like4Embed
