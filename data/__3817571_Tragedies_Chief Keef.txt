I remember being in the streets trying to take some'n (trying to take some'n)
Ride around in the field with a K drum (with a K drum)
Ride down on a fuck nigga, bake some (bake some)
Now I hardly ever even see my day ones (hardly ever even see  my day ones)
I make them disappear, out here like brevity (bang, brevity)
I be floatin' dirty, I don't need no gravity (I don't need no motherfuckin' gravity)
Make her say "Uhh" like Master P (like Master P)
If you ain't gettin' money it can lead to tragedies (tragedies)

Popped up in my crib without permission (permission)
Call that stalkin', call that stalkin' (stalkin', that stalkin')
I went in the mall and bought everything out the store
I call that ballin, I call that ballin (that ballin', beep)
I heard you be trippin' on a thotty (thotty)
I call that fallin', I call that fallin'
I heard you were here flexin' like you catchin' bodies
Dry snitchin' on yo self, I call that talkin' (Oh my god, bitch)
I walked in the club and they all start shakin' ass, shakin ass (shakin' ass)
Dead man in my pockets, someone please call the damn ambulance (ambulance, ambulance, ambulance)
I'm on offense, the defense I'll handle (I'll handle)
Got your bitch meltin' like a lit candle (like a lit candle)
Where I'm from 2-4 means 10-4 (give me a 10-4)
Why I'm flexin' like that I ain't have shit hoe (I ain't have shit hoe)

I remember being in the streets trying to take some'n (trying to take some'n)
Ride around in the field with a K drum (with a K drum)
Ride down on a fuck nigga, bake some (bake some)
Now I hardly ever even see my day ones (hardly ever even see  my day ones)
I make them disappear, out here like brevity (bang, brevity)
I be floatin' dirty, I don't need no gravity (I don't need no motherfuckin' gravity)
Make her say "Uhh" like Master P (like Master P)
If you ain't gettin' money it can lead to tragedies (tragedies)

I swear to God right now I can't even fucking breathe (can't breathe)
One Tooka blunt got me walkin' with a weave (got me walkin' with a weave)
Gave your bitch one pill now she crawlin' on her knees (she crawlin' on her knees)
She was standin' on her head, now she fallin' on her feet (she fallin' on her feet)
Tote the cash baby gone see a doctor for me (doctor for me)
I know before I go get locked up, you gone get locked up for me (get locked up for me)
I know you really will get a nigga shot up for me (shot up for me)
I don't buy bitches but I know you'll buy one for me (buy one for me)
Whoever said living was the stars in the sky (in the sky)
And I'm sitting on the stars in the sky every night (every night)
I'm smokin' on that Mary, yeah, Mary J. Blige (Mary J. Blige)
It was me in the sky and the stars tryin' to fight (stars tryin' to fight)
I just met a bad bitch, but I'm only tryin' to fuck (I'm only tryin' to fuck)
I'm a squirrel no lie, I'ma need another nut (I'ma need another nut)
Remember on the block, sellin' dope, been blowin' punks (blowin' punks)
Run up on him click-clack, 12-gauge him in the trunk (trunk)
I remember being in the streets trying to take some'n (trying to take some'n)
Ride around in the field with a K drum (with a K drum)
Ride down on a fuck nigga, bake some (bake some)
Now I hardly ever even see my day ones (hardly ever even see  my day ones)
I make them disappear, out here like brevity (bang, brevity)
I be floatin' dirty, I don't need no gravity (I don't need no motherfuckin' gravity)
Make her say "Uhh" like Master P (like Master P)
If you ain't gettin' money it can lead to tragedies (tragedies)
