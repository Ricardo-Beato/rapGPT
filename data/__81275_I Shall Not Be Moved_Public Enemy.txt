13 ContributorsI Shall Not Be Moved Lyrics
Say what you oughta, world outta order
Paid the cost father time ain't never lost
The boss, y'all ain't heard it?
I work it, uh, the senior circuit
See some quit it, 'cause they don't get it (Kick it, Chuck!)
Fire music, my aim is, forget what my name is
Yeah, I ain't famous to be famous
Remember Troy Davis
Beware, Clive Davis swarming to your art form
Cause there's a party goin' on
Hotel, motel, I'm goin' in, don't care what they spent
Can't prevent the event
Some run to it, shun from it
Been through it, I still rock to it
I sue, I've been sued dude
With this news fit to spit
And the beat goes on

Uh, come on!
Uh, come on!
Uh, come on!
(Kick it, Chuck!)

Never bitter but better, backed by the fact
All I got is my word, the new curse word is black
Still keep me on this track, still keep me on this track
Don't take me off (I got you, Chuck)
Say the test is being at your best
The curse is living at your worst
Crawlin' like a maggot out of they mind
Faster than a Go-Go forty-five
S*** is live, survive
High with out a goddamn reason why basketball wives
Ain't really wives, birds dropping out of the sky
And y'all Google why? (Yeah!)
You might also like
(Kick it, Chuck!)

Feel the people, heal the people
Need the people, so heed the people
Help the homeless, underfed
Revolution, stop the feds
Leavin' people left for dead
Where's your groove? Check your heads
I shall not, not be moved
I, shall, not, be, moved

Uh, come on!
Uh, come on!
Uh, come on!
(Kick it, Chuck!)

Drive-By Trucker, I play it loud, motherf***er
Use it, don't abuse it, the voice gets rougher
Shout my vocals, I salute all the locals
Slept on, kept them out of radio focus
Hocus-pocus spooks sitting by the sound
Corporations dictate what goin' down
Local acts, I got your back, underground
Make 'em run 'til its dark
Run 'em out of town, they got me started, where I start?
Cause I do it to support the art
What good is learnin' from some record
When y'all only listen to fifteen seconds?
