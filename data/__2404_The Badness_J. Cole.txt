39 ContributorsThe Badness Lyrics
Yeah, keep followin' me
Keep callin' me
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, ayy

Believe in God like the sun up in the sky
Science can tell us how (But), it can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry, then seconds later, she laughs
The beauty of life, the pain never lasts
The rain always pass, the sun donâ€™t always shine (Yeah)
When it's gone, I'm lonely, but when it's there, I'm fine
I hate the wintertime because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga
But at night, they think twice and walk a little faster
It's funny, hunnid-years-ago I'd've called this nigga, "Master"
How the tables turn but still the fire burnin', uh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turnin'
Turnin', I'm lookin' for some higher learnin'
Learnin', girl, you what I desire, yearnin'
Yearnin', you say I'm easily distracted
I think the problem is I'm easily attracted
By the darkside, the temptation got me questionin'
Where my heart lies, I'm tryna separate myself
Like apartheid, but ay the liquor keep swallowin'
I swear I walk with God, but the devil keep followin'
Followin', I say the devil keep followin'
Followin', I say the devil keep followin'
Followin', I say the devil keep followin'
You might also like
Uh, feel like I'm ridin' on a
Chartered plane of broken-hearted pain
Turbulence is constant, my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail
Maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell
But where is my parallel sweetheart? Deep thoughts
Lost in my brain, so I sleep hard nights
With no progress, mane, I'm thinkin' like I'll prob'ly
Find a Loch Ness in the projects before I find this
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Guitar strings is strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinkin' and smokin', sink in this ocean
Leapin' through the badness, hopin' I'm reachin' for closeness
Feel like the devil keep followin' me
Feel like the devil keep followin' me
