11 ContributorsMoney Rule the World Lyrics
Huh, it's Gucci
Yeah
Talk
Zaytoven

I just wanna be honest
Cause baby I don't want no problems
You know I already got a girl
Her name is money and she rule the world
And I ain't tryna cheat on her
Oh no no, oh no no
Said I ain't tryna cheat on her
Oh no no, oh no no

It go like money money on the 
Ain't got a girl, cause I ain't ready for the stress
All that talking shit, asking where I'm at and who I'm with
And you know I'm out here working, bitch, you better get a grip
Cause them shoes don't buy themselves, and that perse ain't buy itself
I was balling for you met me,  with that 
Gucci tought me never let a bitch take you off your grind
Snoop tought me mind on my money, money on my mind
You might also like
I just wanna be honest
Cause baby I don't want no problems
You know I already got a girl
Her name is money and she rule the world
And I ain't tryna cheat on her
Oh no no, oh no no
Said I ain't tryna cheat on her
Oh no no, oh no no

If I had your hands, I'd cut my hands off
 hands off
But I ain't gon do  pants down
So  at a stand off
And I ain't gon lie, that bitch, she too bad
So if we fall out, 
But I had her first, and you had her second
But  you ran off

I just wanna be honest
Cause baby I don't want no problems
You know I already got a girl
Her name is money and she rule the world
And I ain't tryna cheat on her
Oh no no, oh no no
Said I ain't tryna cheat on her
Oh no no, oh no noEmbed
