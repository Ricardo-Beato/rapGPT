23 ContributorsA Million Dollars Lyrics
Hahaha, listen, yeah

I dream, I imagine (What?), I believe that it'll happen (What?)
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
'Cause I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen (Wassup?)
Bitch please, I'ma make a million (Uh)
With ease, I'ma make a million

A lotta times I don't get the credit
Forgettin' about my ethical work
Let it be first said that I'm here to earn bread
I been dedicated ever since I turned ten
Got the type of style quickly gonna turn heads
I been workin', part-time hustla
Hit you with a dub for ya bubbla, it's nothin', bruh
On the road with a dollar and a dream
'Cause anything is possible, believe bitch, please
It ain't nothin' to spit, sparkin' up in the whip
Stayin' stuck up on my dreams like they rubber cement
No one ever see a legend when he stuck on the bench
And my screw's so loose it'll fuck up your wrench
My head can't contain all these dreams of mine
When I'm rich there's some shit I'm gonna leave behind
For now, it's food for thought, here to feed your mind
But you can't get a piece of mine
Nah, homie
You might also like
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
'Cause I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
With ease, I'ma make a million

Now, I can either try and be a hero
Or I can grab a one with six zeros (What?)
What would I do with a million dollars?
First off, I'd start payin' bills to my father
Then pay for college, get TreeJay a camera
Grab a spot in LA, a crib in Atlanta
Cop a Phantom, just to ride in
Some celebrity friends to get high with
Couple foreign models that I fine dine with
'Cause the music that I make is timeless
The pressure's on, don't choke, Heimlich
Maneuver, got my songs all through your computer
You wonderin' is it buzz or just a rumor
I'm Superman, y'all just Lex Luthor
I'ma make a mil, that's for real, no deal
Just the illest mothafucka in the bill, so chill
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
'Cause I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
With ease, I'ma make a million
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
'Cause I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
With ease, I'ma make a million1Embed
