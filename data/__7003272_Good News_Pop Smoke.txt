Faith
To believe in something as though it already existed
Bashar means "bringer of good news" (This is a Melo beat)
When you saw the word "Faith" on this cover, I'm sure you thought this was a gospel album
The word gospel means "the good news"
So in a sense, Bashar is bringing the good news, telling you to believe in yourself
He believed in himself with an understanding that greatness was his to manifest
He had a vision, a plan, and he made it work
Good news, faith, hope, and understanding
The smoke will never clearYou might also like4Embed
