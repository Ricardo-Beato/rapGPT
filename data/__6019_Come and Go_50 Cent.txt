I make 'em move
I make 'em move
I make it hot up in here
Look around
Let's see what we got up in here

Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in (you ain't freaking, we ain't speaking, bitch)
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in (it's Dr Dre and 50 Cent, trick)

They say he couldn't do it, look, now, I did it
I topped 'In the Club', I'm still sipping the bub
The drama, I'm with it, I get biz, you get it
I breezed on that shiddit, I split your widdig
That's why a nigga's bidded, I can't forget it
I said I didn't do it, witnesses said I did it
I'm fresh out on bail, my Benz is all kitted
Five TV's, my rims is so sidick
I cruise through, your bitch just fell in love with it
Baby, come in, girl, I want to give it to you
Once I'm in, it's on, I'm a freak with it
Money comes quidick, hot shit, I spit it
G Unit kidicks, blue New York fitted
Shorty, want to cut, oh, yeah, I'm with it
She comes to my hotel room, she know she's gone get it
Its exercise, my homie, he's been waiting, he's next in line
You might also like
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in (you ain't freaking, we ain't speaking, bitch)
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in (it's Dr Dre and 50 Cent, trick)

People always talking about my reputation
I don't love them, I don't need them
I don't love them, I don't need them
I don't love them
I don't care what she do with him, it's all good with me
Suwoo

They can't do it how I do it, I'm number one, I knew it
I do, I do my thing and gangsters bop to it
It's hit after hit, damn, I'm on a roll
I'm like James Brown now, man, I've got soul
No, I ain't a pimp, but hell yeah, I've got hoes
I was born to do this, when I breathe I make a killing
Think I'm bullshitting, my money's touching the ceiling
Cam buying condos, I'm buying the whole building
I'm pissing on grown women, R Kelly do it to children
You bet against me, boy, I'mma hurt your feelings
Because over and over, I'mma keep on winning
My Rolls Royce's tinted, your Phantom's rented
That's why we never ever ever see you with it
Man, everybody knows, like everywhere I go
When 50 in the club, shit just goes out of control
You can blame it on Em, or blame it on Dre, okay?
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in (you ain't freaking, we ain't speaking, bitch)
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in, (kick 'em out)
Bring 'em in (it's Dr Dre and 50 Cent, trick)3Embed
