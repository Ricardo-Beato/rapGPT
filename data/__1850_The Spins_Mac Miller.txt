65 ContributorsThe Spins Lyrics
Dope shit like that, Jerm
Oh, hi
Welcome back to K.I.D.S., um
Follow your dreams
Yeah

Wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi
A theater to watch my movies
Couple whips and lots of fancy things
The kids they call the Goonies
I see the future, crystal ball
Mirror mirror hangin' on the wall
Who the flyest white boy of them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls
She bubblin', we fuckin', then you cuddlin'
Like, baby, where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So, so we ain't sayin' nothin'
You could probably tell she bluffin'
'Cause she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion
Yeah, she blushin', all red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you the feds
So she says she in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are

Oh (Top drawer, haha), oh, oh (Yeah)
Honey, I need you 'round (Haha)
I know, I know (Just some motherfuckin' kids)
Oh, oh, oh
Honey, I need you 'round (Make money, fuck bitches)
I know (Yeah), I know (Pittsburgh, hey, Jerm, hey)

These hoes is drunk, wanna come and smoke this blunt
Then let me take 'em home and do anything I want
I said, baby, I can ride you, just let me get inside you
I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizer
I got that dope dick, I'll be your supplier
You grabbin' on my sheets and hittin' notes like you Mariah
Obsessed with me
Undress a freak on ecstasy
I'm out and then she textin' me
Like, "What you doin' next week, next week?" (Yeah)

Hear me now
I'm down on knees and praying
Though my faith is weak
Without you so please, baby, please
Give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand up 'til the end
A million times, a trillion more (Hey)
Oh, oh, oh (Hey, I just wanted to inform y'all)
Honey, I need you 'round (I'm drunk as fuck)
I know, I know (Most Dope, bitch, hey)
Oh, oh, oh (K.I.D.S., what's up?)
Honey, I need you 'round (I'm high as fuck, yeah, yes, sir)
I know, I know (Oh, I graduated, oh yeah, I just graduated high school, haha)

Hey, homie
Don't be mad that your girl loves me (Don't cut anything yet)
It's not my fault (Yeah)
I'm just doin' me (Haha)
If your girl love me, let her love me, you feel me?
So, baby
Smile (Uh-huh)
Baby, don't cry
I will only fly
With you by my side26Embed
