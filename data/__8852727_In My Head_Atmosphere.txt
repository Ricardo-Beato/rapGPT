4 ContributorsIn My Head Lyrics
I can't move, I mean I can feel my heart
But the rest of my parts won't start
They stay parked in this darkness
That's when I realized
I possessed complete control of all three of my eyes
So I open 'em wide and try to look around the room
When I assume I'm still laying up in my bed
This ain't just in my head
My defense reflex is effective immediately
Unfortunately my physical don't agree with me
I can't speak, I mean I can use my voice
But can't move my lips or my tongue, it's just noise
I battle with reality but pace my breathing
I'm distracted by the face within the shadows on the ceiling
Maybe it's a demon or an alien being
I wanna pretend that I'm dreaming of course my family sleeping
I try to force my scream but couldn't catch results
Somebody wake me up and come and check my pulse
I can't

Maybe it's only in my head
Maybe I'm all up in my head
Maybe it's only in my head
Maybe you're all up in my head
You might also like
I can't sleep, I used to tell myself that it was paranoia
Telling me to look over a pair of shoulders
Now I know that it's connected to anxiety
Ability to rest affected by something inside of me
Maybe I should try to pay attention to the melody
I hear the devil singing. What she saying? What she telling me?
Maybe it's influenced when I'm under the influence
Or maybe it's God she trying to tell me she ain't interested in listening
She probably judge me for my weird thoughts
Like she wasn't making raindrops out of teardrops
To get to Heaven first you have to go through Hell
You built your own prison might as well sweep the dirt out your cell
Tell me it's a government experiment
They study from a secret bunker underneath the pyramids
Go ahead and give whatever explanation
But please don't try to make me admit that I'm being visited by spacemen
Well, okay then

Maybe it's only in my head
Maybe I'm all up in my head
Maybe it's only in my head
Get outta my head
And honestly, just just tell me that it, that it's spacewomen
'Cause even that would be just a little less bothersome1Embed
