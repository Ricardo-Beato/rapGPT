Shh
808 Mafia
Shutup, Gucci

I let my pockets do the talkin'
They ain't got nothin' to say
And if that bitch ain't pussy poppin'
Get the fuck out my face
And if you niggas ain't talkin 'bout profit
Then y'all ass in the way
Lil' nigga
Talkin loud when he know he a lame
Claimin' blood
Hell naw, boy you know you's a dud
Fiendin' cous'
Hell naw, boy we know you's a scrub
Where the love at?
Naw, man you gets no love
Cous' you so lame!
How the fuck you even get in the club?
I got insane young niggas and they trained to go
I point my fingers like a cross, and God send 'em to ya door
Man y'all niggas ain't no killas, man y'all niggas some hoes
Man y'all niggas ain't no dealers, man y'all niggas some J's
I don't blame you, I blame yo daddyâ€” It was how you was raised
Should take this Tom Ford belt and beat you with it
Like back in the day
They say that Gucci Mane is crazy and I say "I agree"
But they stole so much sauce that I heard their record
And thought it was me
It's Gucci

Lil' nigga
But you'll never, ever, ever be me

Ask your bitch I bet she say I'm the truth
Matter of fact I'm daydreamin' about her right now in the booth
Ya lil' bitch
Wanna crash? We can crash on sight
200 rounds in my clip, we can blast all night

Speak softly and walk real light

It's Gucci
