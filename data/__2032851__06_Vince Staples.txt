Next time on Poppy Street

Good morning, hope you had a good time last night
I need money from e'rybody, muh'fucker, better pay your tithes
Now, I can change your life, fuck what's wrong, fuck what's right
What you want? What you like? Your world been mine

There's niggas getting paid over there
Niggas got it made over there
I'm finna bring the gang and the gua— (*static*)You might also like6Embed
