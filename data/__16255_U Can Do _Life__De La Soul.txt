6 ContributorsU Can Do (Life) Lyrics
C'mon, c'mon
Bounce, bounce
C'mon
Bounce, rock, roll

You can do whatever you want
Whatever you like, it's your own life (Life your life, y'all)
So let me be to do what I want
To do what I like, 'cause this is my life

It's been about ten long years, my skin reeks
Flavors that your incense couldn't match
We burn slow like syphilis in your piss, accommodated
With the penicillin, you're listenin' to
This art official will keep your shoes moonwalkin'
Soon to talk about pop music
You'll buy it 'cause you choose it
A lot of MC's is really S&M-in'
Whips and chains, I maintain like a old jazz singer
Ella Fitz' in any location
Held back in rotation, an apple a day
Only makes a nigga fruity
I eat responsibilities to carry out my duty
Crib in the MDs, I pull it out just to polish it
Make notes if you earnin' or wait your turnbuckle
I stick to gettin' mines like stucco
You might also like
You can do whatever you want
Whatever you like, it's your own life
So let me be to do what I want
To do what I like, 'cause this is my life

I'm that full-time rapper, the nickname's Llama
Part-time father if you ask my daughter's mamas
Missin' in action cause the action got a fraction
Of the world listenin' to me
Got me travelin' overseas in lands constantly
Got a sea of hands wavin', ain't misbehavin'
But a lot of kids cravin' for somethin' they ain't got
Like the keys to the ride and a pocket with a knot and it's
Holdin' they ground 'til they rot in it
Plottin' it, lockin' it down strong
'Cause it's nothin' wrong gettin' your bubblin' on sticker
But too much bubblin' can make you fizz quicker
So, watch your stack, keep your fam intact
And pay attention to the now, I'm clearin' the mess
While they stressin' back in the day, I'm at the front of the night
With my crew shinin' light on the—

You can do whatever you want
Whatever you like, it's your own life
So let me be to do what I want
To do what I like, 'cause this is my life
You can do whatever you want
Whatever you like, it's your own life
So let me be to do what I want
To do what I like, 'cause this is my life
Now, we're on top of this, like a typical bed position
Peepin' your view, got your whole crew wishin' and waitin'
Makin' dollars out of ten dime pieces
Who be sippin' out the glass suckin' on the lime pieces included
In my pieces I pen the good livin'
And even when we're stressin' from in the hood livin'
At least we're livin' and there ain't no hell in that
Give me a yell in that, and go—

I wanna see the world ten times over
Dive off cliffs and land on opportunities unthinkable
You sinkin' straight to the bottom while I float in parades
That St. Patty couldn't put up
All my niggas tryin' to build, then throw your wood up
Design life like PNB gears, so stand clear for the blast off
Last off my chest, peace to Dave West
Live your life to the fullest

You can do whatever you want
Whatever you like, it's your own life
So let me be to do what I want
To do what I like, 'cause this is my life
You can do what you want
What you like
Let me be what I want
What I like1Embed
