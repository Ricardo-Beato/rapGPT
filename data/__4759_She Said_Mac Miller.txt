21 ContributorsShe Said Lyrics
Hey, can you turn it up a little bit?
Hold up, yo, Will, your mom's calling
Can I, uh, can I ignore the call?
I can ignore it? A'ight
I'm feelin' a lil' ill right now
And I don't mean ill like, really cool and awesome
I mean like, I'm comin' down with a sickness
(Aha) A'ight, look
Hey

Well, I was ridin' in shotgun, speedin' down the highway
Listenin' to music, haven't slept in like five days
I try take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real, I swear to God this shit pretend though
'Cause, me, I get high, make music for a livin'
If that ainâ€™t the best job, then give me your opinion
'Cause I love life, chillin' for the night, case of Bud Light
Small world for me, but you, you live a Bug's Life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think it's make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine, love it, grimier than rubbish
You softer than a Snuggie and you sweeter than a Sunkist
Never eatin' beets, on your Doug shit
Come with all the swagger, but you lackin' all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school
Spendin' money, drinkin' liquor, naked girls up in my pool
You might also like
Wake up in my bed, gettin' head, she said (She said)
The act so cool, but she easily impressed
I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes (Yes)
Today a new day (New day), a fresh start (Fresh start)
If you didn't make mistakes, you wouldn't get far (Get far)
Life get hard (Get hard), so we get high (Get high)
You ain't shit 'til you try (Try)

Ayy
Ayo, my herb smoke tastin' like a Nerds rope
I'ma get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat
Somethin' like a millionaire in trainin'
Still my shit amazin', we jumpin' over puddles when it's rainin'
Plannin' on a tan, I'm in the sand
And we'll be jammin', make it bounce
While we dancin' on the clouds until I'm landin' in my house
Remember when my moms would hate me standin' on the couch
But now I'm makin' so much money, I start to lose count
I try and spend it quick, I got bills though
Yeah, I'm only eighteen, I got skills though
Beats, Rhymes, Life, Tribe Called Chill Flow
You been rappin' twenty-five years and you still broke
No disrespect, the riches is the art
I'm just mad at all these haters who was bitches from the start
We just do this 'cause we love it and it's settin' us apart
We was already gone while you was only on your mark, hey
Wake up in my bed, gettin' head, she said (She said)
The act so cool, but she easily impressed
I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes (Yes)
Today a new day (New day), a fresh start (Fresh start)
If you didn't make mistakes, you wouldn't get far (Get far)
Life get hard (Get hard), so we get high (Get high)
You ain't shit 'til you try (Try)6Embed
