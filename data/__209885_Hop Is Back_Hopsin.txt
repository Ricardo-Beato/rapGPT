139 ContributorsHop Is Back Lyrics
Your bullshit, come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!
I got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin’ on it
Now I’m ready to fuck the game up, nigga
They can get it (They can get it)
You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)
Yeah! The Dark Knight's in this bitch
Without the mask and cape, I'm actin' ape shit
Faggot, embrace it, I just got validation
On my ass-whoopin' ticket; I'm that amazin'
It's my mad invasion of smashin' brains in
My fuckin' pen and pad was anxious
All these haters who mad and be naggin' at me
I flip they ass off like an acrobat on a trapeze
And I'll be lashin' back like a Shaq attack on these rap beats
You thought that I was done with completely bein' an ass? (Please)
Don't think you raw just 'cause you got success
I'll uppercut your ass so many times
You look like you was noddin' yes
I'm the only child that my mom regrets
Probly best that you don't buy my album
Save your money, yo, do not invest
You might also like
Your bullshit, come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!
I got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin’ on it
Now I’m ready to fuck the game up, nigga
They can get it (They can get it)
You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)
I consider my flow a malignant rifle
And strip survival, and have you screamin'
Like R&B singers who hittin' high notes
It’s sick and spiteful, 2Pac’s twisted grim disciple
I been this nice, yo, way before Michael had vitiligo
My ex girl's heart is so bruised and burned
Beggin' me to quit rap
But I'm just not ready to let it loose for her
Am I Hopsin or am I Lucifer?
I didn't blow 'til I started talkin' a gang of shit
Tell me who you prefer
Nigga, you ain't ill in the booth
I'd die and do my next show as a hologram
And still be realer than you
See, I'm the shit, like I slithered in poo
I'm sicker than stickin' my freakin' dick
Inside a bitch's syphilis cooch; it's Knock Madness
Your bullshit, come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!
I got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin’ on it
Now I’m ready to fuck the game up, nigga
They can get it (They can get it)
You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)
I got a problem, yo, I was ecstatic to buy Yeezus
But I burned it first, heard it, and snapped it in five pieces
Man, Kanye on that bullshit
That’s why the paparazzi made that nigga hit his fuckin' head, that’s what that fool get
You think you God now
You half-assin' rap little faggot bitch?
Perhaps you suffered brain damage
Back when you had that accident
But most importantly, hip-hop isn’t dead no more, you see
'Cause Kendrick took the bar
And then raised it up higher for MC's
Unfortunately the little nigga's like 4 feet 3
The guy's a fuckin' midget, his high is still really short to me
Fuck givin' my pencil breaks
My mental state tells me to renovate
If you hand me your shit, I'll toss your demo tape
“Hop, if you're not spreading love
Then why do you even write music?"
'Cause this is how I feel
When I ain’t rappin' on the mic, you bitch!
Am I supposed to coat it up? Am I not allowed to open up?
I spill the blood of rappers
And use Weezy dreads to soak it up
Bustin' like South Central driveby's
Support the guy with white eyes
But nigga, don’t ride my dick when I’m on that high rise
Your bullshit, come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!
I got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin’ on it
Now I’m ready to fuck the game up, nigga
They can get it (They can get it)
You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)64Embed
