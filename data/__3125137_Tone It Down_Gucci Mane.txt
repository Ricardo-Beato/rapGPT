Huh, it's Gucci
Droptop (Right now)
Wizop
Huh, Wop (Hitmaka)
Go

Wop, wop, wop, wop (Huh)
VVS the wrist (Wrist)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (Huh)
Might steal your bitch (Bitch)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (Yeah, yeah, huh)
VVS the wrist (Wrist)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (Huh)
Might steal your bitch

Tone that shit down (Ooh, yeah)
You ain't never ball like this
Tone that shit down (Oh, why?)
Tell me who can ball like this
Tone that shit down
Who you know can ball like this?
Tone that shit down (Huh, hol' up, it's Gucci)
Tell me who can ball like this
You might also like
Huh, pull up, froze up with the door up
Chopper in the club, I don't care who show up
Watch lookin' like a glow up, when I throw up (Burr)
Eastside Bouldercrest Road where I growed up
Hold up, lil' homie, tone it down
‘Cause the jewelry that you rockin’ is for kids, I’m a grown-up (Huh?)
Sat courtside right next to the owner
Lookin' so good, make his wife pick her phone up (Wow)
Big gold boulders in my Rollie
Look like Fred Flintstone when he pick a stone up (Ring)
If everybody got a watch like that
Then why would I want that watch? I’m a loner (Yeah)
Damn near had a temper tantrum
'Cause he got that car ‘fore I got it, now I really don’t wanna
You ain't seen a nigga glow up like this
Not a nigga that was trappin’ on a corner (It's Gucci! Yeah)

Wop, wop, wop, wop (Huh)
VVS the wrist (VVS the wrist)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (Huh)
Might steal your bitch (Might steal your bitch)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (Yeah, yeah, huh)
VVS the wrist (VVS the wrist)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (Huh, yeah)
Might steal your bitch (Huh, go)
Tone that shit down (Ooh, yeah)
You ain't never ball like this
Tone that shit down (Oh, why?)
Tell me who can ball like this
Tone that shit down
Who you know can ball like this?
Tone that shit down
Tell me who can ball like this (Huh, go)

Gucci Mane and CB, jewelry lookin' 3D
Tryna be like me ain’t easy (Wow)
Niggas hate me, women wanna date me
‘Cause I got on all these VVS pieces (Yeah)
In that great thing
2018 Rolls-Royce truck, no reason (Huh)
Water on my timepiece wetter than a Fiji
Parked front of the St. Regis (Burr)
Artists wanna meet me
Ballin’ like an athlete, but I ball all four seasons (Ooh)
Diamonds dancin' just like Breezy (Diamonds)
Take it easy breezy, go easy (Huh)
Big stones in all my pieces (Huh)
Gucci Mane stunt like Meechie (Meechie)
Jewelry so cold, I’m sneezin’ (Achoo!)
Pull up South Beach, no ceiling
Tone that shit down (Ooh, yeah)
You ain't never ball like this
Tone that shit down (Oh, why?)
Tell me who can ball like this
Tone that shit down
Who you know can ball like this?
Tone that shit down
Tell me who can ball like this

Yeah, four-four tippin’, I be on a hunnid spokes
Fire weed, hit it, have a nigga seeing ghosts
Tell me what it do 'cause I’m tryna get to know you
Champagne, take a shot, won’t have a hangover (Yeah)

Wop, wop, wop, wop (Huh)
VVS the wrist (VVS the wrist)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (Huh)
Might steal your bitch (Might steal your bitch)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (Yeah, yeah, huh)
VVS the wrist (VVS the wrist)
Wop, wop, wop, wop (Huh, yeah)
