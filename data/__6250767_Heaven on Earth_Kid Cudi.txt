Hear me out
Here we go
Get it
Hmm, mm

No, I ain't got time for no fuckers, no fakes
Rager mode, see I'm stuck in my ways
Strappin' in with the troops and my syndicate
Swear to God, get the fuck out my face, nigga (Yeah)
At it, we kill 'em, we clean 'em up
Tell these niggas they finished, no eulogy
This the shit they been missin', now raise 'em high
Been doin' it, doin' it, doin' it (Perfect, perfect)
Wanted the lights my whole life (Yeah)
Coulda gonе bad, could be trife
Lotta good niggas got caught in the fight (Nigga)
No, this ain't cinеma, psych (Yeah)
Realest of realest now off in the night
Catchin' him pullin' up
I might be hoppin' out with somethin' fit, she thick
My bitch, she murder 'em

In the city, this is rock and roll
My nigga, it's big business, the people's only hope
We ridin' around the city, this is rock and roll
You seein' this fine woman, don't fuck with messy hoes

Don't embellish, it's hellish, we in, the strongest of men, catch us on the throne (Right?)
Yeah (Yeah), yeah, yeah, yo
Heaven on Earth, I am curious, yeah, I'm livin', I'll ride til' I'm gone (Right?)
Nice (Yeah), yeah, nigga, what?
Don't embellish, it's hellish, we in, the strongest of men, catch us on the throne (Right?)
Yes (Yeah), yeah, mm, uh
Heaven on Earth, I am curious, yeah, I'm livin', I'll ride til' I'm gone (Right?)
Sh (Yeah), sha, sh, sha

See just what you see in a nigga life
Searchin' in these streets, what I need? I'ma roll the dice
Demons, they will creep, zonin', 2 a.m. (God)
Please watch over me, please watch over me (Heaven)

Tell 'em all
Nigga, no justice, no peace, no dealin' with drama
Can't help that I worry mom
Nigga, hop off of the leash, here we go
Drop the bomb
Ain't no thing in this world that can keep me from peace but me
Here I am, look, a star
Animal, thanking myself for my sacrifice (Woof), cut the lights low
He don't fold
My girl look pretty, she sippin' merlot
Hand me my Fronto, my tree, and my roll up, my kit
Precision, I do this like so
You already know, ho, bullshit can't fuck up my flow (Yeah)
The devil is out and he's on to me, but my angels protectin' my soul (Yeah)
In the city, this is rock and roll
My nigga, it's big business, the people's only hope
We ridin' around the city, this is rock and roll
You seein' this fine woman, don't fuck with messy hoes

Don't embellish, it's hellish, we in, the strongest of men, catch us on the throne (Right?)
Yeah (Yeah), yeah, yeah, yo
Heaven on Earth, I am curious, yeah, I'm livin', I'll ride til' I'm gone (Right?)
Nice (Yeah), yeah, nigga, what?
Don't embellish, it's hellish, we in, the strongest of men, catch us on the throne (Right?)
Yes (Yeah), yeah, mm, uh
Heaven on Earth, I am curious, yeah, I'm livin', I'll ride til' I'm gone (Right?)
Sh (Yeah), sha, sh, sha16Embed
