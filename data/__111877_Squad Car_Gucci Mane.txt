22 ContributorsSquad Car Lyrics
They say authorities have found at least forty nine people there
(What makes this even scarier, look where it happened)
We reported that FBI statistics show a dramatic increase in homicides in Atlanta zone 6 precinct

Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
But all my niggas we got bond fare
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
But all my niggas we got bond fare

Bail money, Bail money
Yeah bitch I got bail money
Smelling like the jail, and I know I look like hell, honey
You say that that's your friend
It's just another nigga that's gon' tell on me
I'm a street nigga and my girl ain't street
But I talk so slick she fell for me
Locked up since last Sunday
Someone please call the bail bondsman
Strapped up like Charles Bronson
These fuck niggas ain't gon' do nothing
Like a poker game they be bluffing
Softer than a blueberry muffin
Shoot first and I ain't asking questions
Selling drugs is my profession
Selling dope out the Best Western
Strapped up with my Smith and Wesson
Fifty bricks just came from Texas
Driving in a UPS
T-rexing, I'm driving reckless
All the dope that I get, I stretch it
Going overboard to make my mission
Severing heads to send a message
You might also like
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
But all my niggas we got bond fare
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
But all my niggas we got bond fare

Just got jammed up on some bullshit
Court date ain't until the 26th
On the phone right now with the bonding company
Got my old lady stressed cuz I'm pitching fits
Ready go, ready go, ready go right now
Got that check from the bitch, come get me now
Got a warrant on my ass, come get me fast
When them folks find out, they gon' hide my ass
Can't sit down now, got too much goin'
Got three trap houses, five hoes hoein'
Plus me and Guwap finna wreck the game
Came for the cash, nigga fuck the fame
Sitting back just chillin', sippin' dirty shit
Trying to keep OG from murking shit
Trying to keep Alley and Trouble from taking shit
Young Scooter got to run the south, raping shit
Whoop, Whoop
Turn off, it's a roadblock
Whoop, Whoop
Hit the gas, nigga don't stop
Whoop, Whoop
If they get close nigga you better pop
We can't go to jail, we got twenty bricks
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
But all my niggas we got bond fare
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
But all my niggas we got bond fare

I get lots of dough
I fuck lots of hoes
Ten thousand a show, ain't spit no game, we on the go
My son just turned 4
I just poured a 4
Louie to the flo', dunk sitting on 24's
Young mob in the set
Brick Squad cut the check
If we beefing, better not leave the house without your vest
All my niggas trained to kill like Steven Seagal
Rap niggas like Duval
My niggas will shoot ya'll
40k off in the Levi
Money standing knee high
Been trapping since I was knee high
Pour my drink in the Peach Nehi
One point five in my stash
Fuck five-O I'm trapping out
My young niggas sit on gold
They'll kill you over my logo
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
God damn that's a squad car
Woop woop
But all my niggas we got bond fare
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
God damn that's a squad car
Whoop! Whoop!
But all my niggas we got bond fare4Embed
