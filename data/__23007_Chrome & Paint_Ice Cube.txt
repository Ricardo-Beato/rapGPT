Yay-YAY! Cali-forn-yi-aye
Sunday afternoon baby, pull it out
Whip it out, pull it out, drive it out, drop it out
You know! Let 'em know

I got chrome and paint
Nigga what you thank, I got chrome and paint
Bitch what you drank, I got chrome and paint
Smokin that dank in my chrome and paint
Street lights - dance on paint
Street lights - dance on chrome
Street lights - get a nigga home
You can die in these streets all alone

I am the wrong nigga, too fuckin grown nigga
To go for that nigga, I ain't 'cha ho nigga
I got, a hair trigger, I am the dome splitter
The deep-sea sniper, you got the wrong niggas
Retire like Jigga, here comes the Attila the Hun
Killin niggas for fun, these rappers is done
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
I burn like the sun, continue to ball
He's got nuts and plus the Don touch
And split the fine dutch, Starsky call Hutch
He's laid, with some sluts, up in some guts
Just back, in the cut, he thinks he's King Tut
Can't fuck, this nigga up, cause just, the nigga luck
That niggas, really love him and tear the city up
Uhh, even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
You might also like
I got chrome and paint
Nigga what you thank, I got chrome and paint
Bitch what you drank, I got chrome and paint
Smokin that dank in my chrome and paint
Street lights - dance on paint
Street lights - dance on chrome
Street lights - get a nigga home
You can die in these streets all alone

I'm ghetto like grits, die befo' I snitch
Off my ass khakis sag like cellulite tits bitch
Under the suede, headliner and I ain't yo momma
Play with my dollars on yo' ass they'll be layin flowers
I put a hole in your brain with these hollow hot rocks
Hittin the switch, makin the fo' hopscotch
Rollin up imperial in dickie material
All in your periphreal, throwin shells at your vehicle
Clipped up, pimped up, big chipped up
Stacy Adams tips spiffed up, golf hat flipped up
I blow yo' ass off the map, fuck with Dub
I'll have yo' ass rollin home with windshield glass on your lap
Fuck rap, I'm wearin a creased tee, eatin ribs
Laughin at you niggas on MTV Cribs
I got the chrome thang thang to make the dome stank
Hood life forever bitch, chrome and paint, c'mon

Street lights (woop woop) {*2X*}
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo
