My girl never drops her focus (Yeah), ayy

She fuck with me in a mobile, ayy
Get this money by myself, yeah
Counting hundreds by myself, yeah
Counting all these commas, spending all these commas
Rich nigga wealth, yeah
Little bitch, I'm your dad, yeah (Huh?)
Spending all this fucking cash, yeah
Rob a nigga with no mask, yeah

I do not really have friends
Strapped the fool Quez, that's my kin
Driver pull up in that Benz
She pulling up with her friends
Twenty bitches coming over
Twenty thousand in a coaster
Make it clap like a nola
Make it shake like a motor
Say she in love with a nigga
Say she in love with the life
I ain't been home in a minute
And yes, she be getting me right
Say she really want a sentence
My young niggas got plenty
Hundred thousand in the skinnies
Fishtailing out of Denny's
We gonna book you a day
I get the money, escape
You know the windbreaker is Bape
You know I Louis the drapes
Hustle brand new, ain't got plates
Call up Michelle for a plate
Make me the strip, wanna stay
You know that I got the cake
What? Yeah (Huh?)
I got that money, I'm ballin' (I got it)
You got that money, you broke (No)
My handgun don't got a holster (Bah)

Uh, no you can't hold this (Get off)
What? Yeah (Huh?)

You got that money, you broke (No)
My handgun don't got a holster (Bah)
All of my niggas, they soldiers (Yeah)
Throwing elbows like Magnolia (Uh)
Know that my belt be that Goyard (Huh?)
Uh, no you can't hold this (Get off)

Gun on my boat like I'm Mystikal (Whoa)
Bitches be broke, then you pitiful (Get out)
My watch is Sonny like Digital (Woo)
Bitches be broke, we ain't hearing you
I got that bank and I show it (Show it)
Walk in the bank and they know me (They know me)
Might cop a tank with a Rollie (Whoa)
Might cop a tank with a Rollie, yeah
What? (What?), yeah (Yeah)
Nigga, do not run up on me (No)
I got that llama up on me (Woo)
Then we gon' come for your homies
That nigga talked to the police (What he say?)
Telling a nigga description (Damn)
Said that a nigga was fly as a bitch
And they was taking his picture (Woo)
And the jewelry all gold, yeah (Gold)
And he pull up with his woes, yeah (Woes)
V.I.P. full of hoes, yeah
Baby playing with her nose, yeah
I'm the type to put a bitch to work
You the type to go up in her purse
Me and Uzi Vert in the vert
Me and Uzi Vert in the vert
What? Yeah (Huh?)
