8 ContributorsThe Money Lyrics
(Get bent, keep wildin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Leavin' permanent scars, like getting splashed on the island)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Gimme yours, or get your manhood taken)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money

Hey yo' what you wanna do with that black deuce-deuce
Hit you up, take that cash you ain't slug-proof dude
Takin' yours to survive, it's only matter of time
I'm snatchin', livin' grimy, runnin', never look back
The root of evil got me acting like that
Life ain't a game, the streets is mortal combat
I wasn't blessed with the silver spoon
Since my born, I was doomed, confined to one room
Now you a customer
Copping from natural born hustlas (that's what he thought kid)
Stupid son, he get extorted

(New York, New York get bent, keep wildin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Leavin' permanent scars, like getting splashed on the island)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Gimme yours, or get your manhood taken)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
You might also like
Open your eyes, get wise, and look alive, pay attention
I'm manifestin', my slugs be leavin' niggas guessin'
You tried to graduate, but didn't know enough lessons
Time is of the essence, and yours is runnin' out fast
You won't last, livin' out your life like that
You shoulda got down with my crew, slingin' cracks international
But instead, you wanna merge with the rivals
And moves like that could end up homicidal
You suicidal, and I'm (alive on arrival)
Play the drug game with precision, and never with division
I'm tryna' see addition, food to fill my kitchen
Some faggot niggas snitchin' givin info
We'll do a drive by, in a stolen black Pinto
With tinted windows, bullets will flurry through your system
Your man ran, lucky for him, because we missed him
Catch him on the rebound, but see now
I'm tryna make this money and you tryna stop me, what's it gonna be now
You stand up to my crew and get laid down
On the ground with the big four pound
You hear the sound on the other side of town
Where caps get peeled, break you off, love, love
Give you somethin' to feel

Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(New York, New York, get bent, keep wildin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Leavin' permanent scars, like getting splashed on the island)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Gimme yours, or get your manhood taken)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
You don't have to tell me twice
I know when to chill when I have to
But if I have to, I'll still clap you
I'll crack through your fortress, you couldn't hold it down
So you lost it, no crew could withstand the forces
Never second guess me, just bless me
Stop smilin', bodies stackin', dead presidents piled in
We wildin', lifted, terror three sixes
They got a petition, for my conviction
Rise to the occasion when it's time for blazin'
On the 41st side niggas is ravin'
For drama, we can handle it, it ain't nothin cause we used to it
It’s all good, the 'hood we ran through it
Since young, it used to be candy, but now it's guns
Stickin niggas son, my job ain’t done

Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(New York, New York, get bent, keep wildin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Leavin' permanent scars, like getting splashed on the island)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Gimme yours, or get your manhood taken)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money2Embed
