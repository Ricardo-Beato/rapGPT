So much molly, I can’t feel my body (Wasted)
This party ’bout to turn into an orgy

This 5 Cali bitches, let me sneak this Georgia peach in (What?)
“Good grief, I can’t breathe, can we take a break?” (Sorry)
She’ll suck your dick through your briefs, eat beef like a steak (She nasty)
She put my dick on a plate, then she said her grace (Damn)
