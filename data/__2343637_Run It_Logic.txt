112 ContributorsRun It Lyrics
Me and my team gotta intervene
What's the point of living if you ain't living a dream?
We live in a world where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming "Money ain't a thing", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew that living out a dream
Meant living out a suitcase, I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get money—run it

What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen
Boy, this been my house, this is merely an addition
Fuck 'em and their permission, they was killin' the game
Who the one that gave 'em remission?—you know the name
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget, second time around shit is different
Cause they know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating
They can suck my dick—run it
You might also like
I'ma do somethin' different for the last one
I'ma go in...

Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey
On an Interstellar mission in Chicago
At the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I gotta beware of the people
But I take care of the people
When I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No, we ain't never acquainted
On the rise like a defendant
That was charged with possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision
God damn, can you feel it?
Uh, I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot
Just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a PlayStation
'Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em
I'm too tied up, this a ransom—
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
Autographs off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan, anything you wanna do you can
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact, you should take a step back—cause I run it61Embed
