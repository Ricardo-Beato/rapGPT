5 ContributorsCrown LyricsYou cannot have the crown without the cross
I'm talkin about somewhere in your life there is a cross
That drives you to the Father
Ladies and gentlemen
I know, I know that it's coming
A blessing is coming my way, yeah
Not comin in houses
Worth more than silver and gold, yeah
I rather have you in my soul
Even when the world thinks it's a joke
Churches talkin' holy, but no ghost
People dyin', steady losing hope
Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
So i'mma keep running this race, yeah
And nobody killing my faith, yeah
Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
The way they see you flex here
When I get to heaven I'mma say Amen
Say Amen, yeah

Run and dance
Praise him 'cause I made it in
Made it in
Yessir
When I get to heaven i'mma say Amen
Say amen
'cause one day, one day
I'm gonna get my crown
One day, one day
I'm gonna wear my crown
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
Yeah
One day, one day, one day
I shall wear a crown
So, so many people so cold
'cause they don't really know ya'
Oh thank you Lord
Standing hollerin' God we trust
But do they really love ya'? (do they, do they)
Connected by the truth that hurts us right now
Pray for the path that keeps shutting me down
Try to take my life and shut it all out
Oh Lord, we need you right now
Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
So i'mma keep running this race, yeah
And nobody killing my faith, yeah
Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
Woah I can't wait to see your face, yeah
When I get to heaven i'mma say Amen
Grab my crown and run and dance
Praise him 'cause I made it in
When I get to heaven i'mma say Amen
Say amen
'cause one day, one day
I'm gonna get my crown
One day, one day
I'm gonna wear my crown
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
Yeah
One day, one day, one day
I shall wear a crown
See believing is really knowing the unknown
Something we can not see
So far gone, that's come blind to our eyes
But it's time for us to wake up and realise we need GodEmbed
