Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas

Young Rich Nigga, I'm draped up in Versace
I went up to the jeweler, when I left I'm playin' hockey
Bad bitches like it, she see Rarris & Buggatis
I'm poppin' bottles in the vip, she rollin' off a Molly
Fendi Prada Louie bally, I don't need a stylist
I'm takin' all my goons to Cali, then we hit the islands
Order up 500 1s, I throw it all it follies
Plug in Japan, so we kick it like karate
Bad bitch from Switzerland, her daddy G. O`Donnie
Every time I'm on the phone we talkin' 'bout some money
I weigh it up, and wrap it up, I ship it across the country
The streets a concrete jungle, play the game like it's Jumanji

Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
You might also like
My pockets is sloppy, only buy Rarris and Gottis
My clothes are exotic, Versace you copy
Migo gang is my posse, takin' over like the Nazi's
I just got out the county, money old like Bill Cosby
Hunnid bands, in all hundreds, when I make it rain it thunder
Cop a Lam every summer, wrappin' bricks like it's a condom
I'm a rich nigga bitch, don't even think about licks
Slap a nigga with a stack, then I piss on that bitch
In the club sippin lean, but I'm still buying cris
Shawty wanna talk to Offset, bitch you ain't on the list
Don't mix the lean with the sprite, drink my mud out the seal
I'm in Louie and Bally, I rock my bitches Chanel

Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas

Young Rich Nigga follow me like Twitter
All green diamonds on my neck look like the Riddler
Red white & green Louis bought them on the day of Christmas
Im the teacher you the student put you in detention
I got the camic you my chef and put you in the kitchen
Now you dirty dancing boarding wippin washing dishes
I took yo main bitch and then I turned her to my mistress
Pull up in Audi pull up in Rarri whip full of net it is a mystery
The rich nigga of the century its going down in history
Energizer bunny wrist keep going it got energy
Back then you ain't know me now that sack make you remember me
Got that 45 for my enemy tell the Lord forgive the sin in me
Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
Money and the power, you gotta have respect
Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas
