87 ContributorsInside Outside Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Shoulda died already (Faces)
I shoulda died already, shit (Faces)
Yeah

I shoulda died already
(Faces) Came in, I was high already
E'rybody trippin' that my mind ain't steady
(Faces) For my sin, shoulda been crucified already, rah!
Why the fuck you need me? (Faces)
Don't you know how to fly already?
Try and tell you that it ain't real (Faces)
Tell 'em, "Find that yeti"
(A-ooh!) Oh (Faces)
Motherfucker (I'm that yeti!)
And it all could end right now (Faces)
I never been so ready
(Faces) All my homies philosophers
(Damn right!) (Yes) Yeah
(Faces) All my homies philosophers (Woo!)
And I don't need nobody (Yes,) I would love somebody, though
Don't you ever get it fucked up (Faces)
(Fuck yeah) Everybody wanna be God
Besides God, he wanna be like us (Faces)
We ain't never sleep too much
Beat that pussy up, she gonna need that trust
(Faces) Never see me in the street too much
But on the inside, I'm outside
All the time (Faces
Faces, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Try and stay away from electric shock (Faces)
That electric shock (Faces)
I'm outside
