I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I’m about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga, I’m from Georgia, that’s the realest state

I’m feeling like New Zealand, charge it to the Am-Ex
Gotta use that latex or she living like a princess
They don’t wake you up in private, let a nigga sleep
I got houses in the mountains, man Will Smith live down the street
Got that generation money, my grandkids are assholes
Stacking something dummy, every verse I got got cash flow
Monaco they loved me, I’m wearing something ugly
But they still know I’m rich though so my doo-rag lookin’ stuffy
Rollin’ with the royalty, Kauai is just my Camelot
Glasshouse, champagne, white shirt, no socks, no top Saint Bart's
Pushin’ 997’s like I’m making fuckin’ phone calls
Half a mill' is low ball
Lot of diamonds light bright, whiskey older than Betty White
Spot me on Dalmatian Croatian girls salvation us
Make something of myself man
Somebody let ’em know, ‘cause it’s that Eastside nigga (A-T-L!)
You might also like
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I’m about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga, I’m from Georgia, that’s the realest state

Ridin’ around with a whole meal, real estate, can a nigga live?
Gold slug, no ice grill, deal with Molly, no x pill
Georgia nigga I’m A-town, Eastside nationwide
Rep nigga like Tim Briggs, killed them, homicide
Real estate that’s my estate Georgia peach like Big Meech
Mason Ave, that’s my street, we sellin’ crack on Front Street
Old money got dust on it, old chopper got rust on it
New crib got a ticket on it, just cashed out seven figures on it
Baby mama, stank bitch fought child support, I’m too rich
Pussy ho got lucky, you can pay your bills on my dick
My driver license’s suspended, but I’m still ridin’ in a Bentley
I’m still strapped with that semi, real estate we winnin’
Me and Childish Gambino plenty chips, no casino
Poppin’ bottles with models, they gon' suck on some pronto
Put my grill in your real estate, know I come from that realest state
Niggas eatin' off our paper plate, we just copped them new Audi 8's
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I’m about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga, I’m from Georgia, that’s the realest state
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I’m about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga, I’m from Georgia, that’s the realest state

Man, Atlanta showing love too, man
Shout out to Eastside, shout out to Southside, Westside
And fuck the Northside, man them niggas up there be testin’
Ain’t nothing changed man, we still get money out here
Royalty forever in this bitch
Gambino nigga, you know what I’m saying?
That new shit man
One time for the one time man, real nigga stand up
Two times for the bad bitches, three for the rich
You know what I’m talking about?
You know what it is man, yeah man
Money talk, bullshit walkin’ marathon
Real niggas know what I’m talking about
Royalty forever motherfucker
Gambino forever motherfucker
Get used to it, Royalty nigga, Royalty motherfucker
Motherfucking Eastside stand up, Stone Mountain, L-town
We in this bitch like we fuckin' a dog or some shit, my nigga
Man y’all motherfuckers already know what it is
Royalty forever in this bitch, bitch niggas fall back
Real recognize real and y’all sucka niggas ain’t it
You feel me? Man don’t watch me, watch TV
Wait, ‘Bino on that shit too, God damn!
Man, we gettin' that white people money, you heard that?
Matter of fact Tina, tell these niggas what I’m talking about one time
Yeah, we in here, we in this thing
Gambino is forever, Royalty is forever
We ballin’ ‘till we fuckin’ up the hardwood homey
This is the life we live, son
My president is black and my Prius is blue, motherfucker
Royalty all day, we droppin’ racks in Nordstroms, son
That’s racks on racks, damn it
You feel me? You feel me?
This is the part where most people would say something crazy and drop the n-word after it
Not going to, not gonna do that
I don’t feel comfortable
I’m out!11Embed
