6 ContributorsLate Night Lyrics
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late
We get it poppin' on a
Pop-popping' on a
Back-Backpack full of goodies
Backpack full of good-
Backpack full of goodies
Backpack full of good-
Backpack full of goodies
Backpack full of good-
Pop-poppin' on a late night
Poppin' on a late

We get it poppin' on a late night, rockin' 'til the day
You be in the corner just talking to some lames
Watch me as I take flight hopping on the plane
I'll be goin' til the song drop, drop and go away
Drop and go away?
Bring it right back
And I'ma fight that man in the tight slacks
He need an ice pack, he need his life back
All up in his grill like rat-a-tat-tat
And Mac is that cat looking bad in all black
With my brain in the clouds, so your girl can call back
You mad that your game like the dude from Mall Rats
You rookie ain't better than the Mac, fall back
I see the way that you talking to your date
You either gay or you not up on your game
I keep it moving, ain't stopping for the Jakes
Cause e'rybody know we get it poppin' when it's late
You might also like
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late
We get it poppin' on a
Pop-popping' on a
Back-Backpack full of goodies
Backpack full of good-
Backpack full of goodies
Backpack full of good-
Backpack full of goodies
Backpack full of good-
Pop-poppin' on a late night
Poppin' on a late

Backpack full of goods, just walkin' down the street
Three in the morning, wanna get something to eat
My body needs nothing, nothing but some sleep
But my head stay awake, just bumpin' with this beat
We get it popping while e'ryone passed out
Backpack strapped plaid, go and pull your cash out
See your mommy who be tryna pull her ass out
And her man in the corner getting mad now
Cause my homies 'bout to crush any girl around
Loving me cause money well attended, spin the world around
And I be 'bout a dollar like anyone else
I'm so hungry for some money that I steal it from myself
That don't make sense, well I ain't about a nickel (Nickel)
Dumbass rappers just riddle (Aha)
I keep it moving, ain't stopping for the Jakes
Cause e'rybody know we get it popping when it's late
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late night
We get it poppin' on a late
Pop-poppin' on a late
We get it poppin' on a
Pop-popping' on a
Back-Backpack full of goodies
Backpack full of good-
Backpack full of goodies
Backpack full of good-
Backpack full of goodies
Backpack full of good-
Pop-poppin' on a late night
Poppin' on a lateEmbed
