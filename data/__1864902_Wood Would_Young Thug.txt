(Thugger, Wheezy)
(Yeah! Yeah, yeah, Yeaahh!)
(Haaaa!)

Rastafari, smoking on Marley
Mama, I'm sorry, got it in order hey
Ballin' like I'm Spalding, bitch, I'm only startin'
Blowing  money, call it ballin', put some rims inside the water
Everything I say I do it, Hawks game, Thugger on the wood
Eat that jello like pudding, put this log in her life, no wood
(Yeah!)
Before I leave, I'ma make sure that she would
(Yeah!)

I won't be a pet (What?)
No counseling, I'm gon' make it work
I'll shoot but I ain't talkin' no Bird
I'm screaming flex, she screamin' flirt
And now she on me like a Perc'
My fuckin' weed smell like a turd (What?)
I just made ten mil' off of merch
When I take boost I'm so alert
Droppin' my top when I pull up
They bring out the block for me (Skrrt)
Capital J-O-I-N 'cause they know there's no stopping me
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
Got my weight up
I must've been eating my beef and my broccoli
Bossed up young nigga
Man I don't hit the mall, they shop for me

Running my money up for all my kids and my niggas
Bitches don't try me they know I bang red I can't never be cuz
Don't care if you cousin boy it's disrespectful if you call me cuz
Yeah, I'm havin' toys and them toys no R Us
Come get your bitch off my dick, sucking my blood like a tick
And I cannot feel or stop it (Yeah)
We are the best, dominant, yeah
I zipped down my pants, she gon' snort like a pig (Sing to 'em, Thug)
She goin' out of control (Why?)
Lil' momma know she got a nigga out of control (Ayy)
She know I'ma bring out the sauce just like Chipotle
Shawty pussy wet as a ocean and I know it

Rastafari, smoking on Marley
Mama I'm sorry, got it in order hey
