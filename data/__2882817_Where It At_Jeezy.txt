11 ContributorsWhere It At Lyrics
Yeah, yeah (where it at?)
Yeah, yeah (where it at?)
Yeah, yeah (where it at?)
Uhh, yeah, let's go

Came a long way from the metro (where it at?)
Now a 50 foot ceiling blowing petro (where it at?)
Swear a nigga went platinum on that Boost Mobile (where it at?)
I said platinum on that Boost Mobile
Run a Fortune 500 from a prepaid (where it at?)
IRS talking tax, you know what we pay (where it at?)
And if it Gregory Hines then it's tapped home (where it at?)
These niggas talking bout it where it at home?

I'm all about my business, I'm a business man
Got two off in the box, ain't talking Timberlands
Cut it down the middle like I'm Freddie Kruger
Then throw it in that water like a barracuda
See Diesel in the Ferra $1000 frames
250 for the Memphis $1000 Haynes
Boy you got you when this shit is sounding like a single
O's on the counters looking like it's steal your pringles
These niggas talking bails or they making bails
Hey what's the tracking number? You say it's in the mail
They say the phone bugged, it got mosquitos on it
The white boys eavesdropping like the Beatles on it, damn

Break them 36s down into 18s
Traffic in a black van like the A-Team
Got 6 gold ropes on, I'm Mr. T
Can't talk about the trap and not mention me
Type of shit I be thinking in my elevators
All the way up, motherfuck a hater
And baking soda still in the refrigerator
Imitating ass nigga, you's an imitator
Hey, favorite rapper talking like he's El Chapo
Like he making orders like at Del Taco
They say the phone bugged it got mosquitos on it
That's when I pull up in that Wraith with them Adidas on it, damn

If the dope game was the rap game I'd be LA Reid
I get all my niggas budgets, pay they lawyer fees
See the rap game like the dope game, ain't no loyalty
But we pay your ass in work and not no royalties
You been looking for Yo Gotti, I'm in the bank nigga
Nigga dozing off on them pills and drank nigga
Count up 5 million cash, make you faint nigga
I just bulletproofed the Wraith, now it's a tank nigga
Bitch say she getting money, I'ma ask her (where it at?)
From the country, damn right, I'ma text her (where it at?)
But when this bitch cold name that's a fraction (where it at?)
Multiply it, don't divide it, we just add it where it's at
