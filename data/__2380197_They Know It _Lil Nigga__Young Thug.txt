11 ContributorsThey Know It (Lil Nigga) Lyrics
I keep like 10 to 12 bitches in here with me
(Oh, they know it, oh yeah, they know it)
I told you when they gave me a chance I wouldn't defeat it
(Oh, they know it, oh yeah, they know it)
These niggas know what's happenin' with a real nigga
Hey, these niggas know what's brackin' with a real nigga
Hey, yo' brain is empty like an attic lil nigga
Got my papi but I live like a bastard lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga

Hey, I'm Jes√∫s
He gon' come with two like a motherfucking coupe
I got lots of hoes like I'm Uncle fuckin' Luke
You can catch me at the post I'm sendin' these bitches through
I, dropped off the top and now it look like that bitch at the movies
Hey, and after that she let me catch all of the cooties
Walking downtown, it's still on me, yeah that wooley
I might put my face down if she tell me cause I do this
Lil mama know I do it
Her mama know I do it
They Grandmama know I do it
All age numbers know I do it
I climbing right out of space
And my wrist stay frosty like a flake
Hold up, hold up, wait, yeah

I keep like 10 to 12 bitches in here with me
(Oh, they know it, oh yeah, they know it)
I told you when they gave me a chance I wouldn't defeat it
(Oh, they know it, oh yeah, they know it)
These niggas know what's happenin' with a real nigga
Hey, these niggas know what's brackin' with a real nigga
Hey, yo' brain is empty like an attic lil nigga
Got my papi but I live like a bastard lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga

Ayy, I keep 'bout twenty thousand at all times on me
I keep 'bout twenty grams on my lips but I ain't OD
He my big dog, no alphabet but he a OG
She wanna roll but she ain't talkin' 'bout no weed
Know some hoes who got needs, so know I can't please them
They in it for money, they start actin' funny
Then they change up like the seasons
Keep your girl, CPR, put her mouth on me
Thought I stopped breathin'
I keep 'bout twenty bitches in the studio with me (At all times)
I'ma keep bout twenty pistols in the studio with me (At all times)
I'ma put my niggas, ain't gon' leave nobody left out
Don't know where to go, I'm feelin' so stressed out, that's why

I keep like 10 to 12 bitches in here with me
(Oh, they know it, oh yeah, they know it)
I told you when they gave me a chance I wouldn't defeat it
(Oh, they know it, oh yeah, they know it)
These niggas know what's happenin' with a real nigga
Hey, these niggas know what's brackin' with a real nigga
Hey, yo' brain is empty like an attic lil nigga
Got my papi but I live like a bastard lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga
Lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga
Lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga, lil niggaEmbed
