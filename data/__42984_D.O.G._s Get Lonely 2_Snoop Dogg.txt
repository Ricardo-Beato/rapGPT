5 ContributorsD.O.G.â€™s Get Lonely 2 Lyrics
What's up baby can I get with you?
Its called dogs get lonely 2
Bow-wow

I don't give a damn, what your homies say
You don't stay on me, you're always out to play
You're so hard to find, seems your shaking me
D.O.G.'s we get lonely

Look here baby girl D.O.G.'s we get lonely
You can ask all my homies, all D.P.G. got tenderoni's
Now when we on the road trying to get this paper
And phone call away is what you say
But sometimes you got to find time to get up
To get out and get away You feel me
Now all I want to do is stay real and stay true
I'm trying to have a little something, and keep you satisfied, but
 my homeboys say its time to ride then I'm a ride
See I'm a gangsta I always be a gangsta you can't change me
Despite at night I might get lonely ya heard me come and serve me
I'd love to take you to the mall
Buy you a little something go to the movies too
If that's what you want to do, that's what you trying to do
That's what we going to do
Now I'm a put you on a back burner
Cause I got to get this cheese with my crew
But baby momma full of drama ain't that right
D.A.Z. dog's get lonely too
Now you knew the dog was dangerous and you took it
You got good loving
You hook me up a good meal
But you still couldn't hook me
Let me stop lying, I'm trying to be too cool, I shaking the real
All my homies do y'all know D.O.G.'s can get lonely too that's real
You might also like
I don't give a damn, what your homies say
You don't stay on me, you're always out to play
You're so hard to find, seems your shaking me
D.O.G.'s we get lonely
I don't give a damn, what your homies say
You don't stay on me, you're always out to play
You're so hard to find, seems your shaking me
D.O.G.'s we get lonely

Yo yo check this out baby
I'm not even going to rap on this one
I'm not I'm not much of a rapper at all
But check this out I'm a put this P.I. down to you real small
I mean I got to get this money I'm out here hanging with my homeboys
We do what we do we been doing this
Before I even met you, you know what I'm saying
Times get hard my homies gone be there I know you there for me
I know you want to do those things that
That a woman supposed to do for a nigga like me
I mean when I get lonely I'm a holler at you
You gon' be there for me
That's real

I don't give a damn, what your homies say
You don't stay on me, you're always out to play
You're so hard to find, seems your shaking me
D.O.G.'s we get lonely
I don't give a damn, what your homies say
You don't stay on me, you're always out to play
You're so hard to find, seems your shaking me
D.O.G.'s we get lonelyEmbed
