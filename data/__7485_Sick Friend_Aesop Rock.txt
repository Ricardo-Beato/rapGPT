21 ContributorsSick Friend Lyrics
Thou mayest indeed
Tune onto the forbidden channel
And see it like it is baby
*Record Scratch in*
Who shall be our champion?
What manner of channel beholdest thou
Shall it fall on me?
Deceit, deceit, deceit
*Record Scratch out*
"Getting dusty in the cellar"

Yo
I always think about my sick friend
Stringing a ring around my wit's end
Thirteen loops later his feet hung inches out the pig pen
Motley day goblins brought up pillage to pass the stillness
With bad javelin tip dipped inside barreled black magic brilliance
Who rose at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier?
To capture the fascist fragment choreographed in traffic dancing for nickels
Hooked like sickle cells to the principles of comradery
One hope distortion odyssey sputters itself to my how not example sample
Divvy the bread crust while considering the littering
I don't pity the head rush or the whimpering, spill
Anchor to rock bottom, rocks bottom packs a ravenous catalyst
Sprung alacritive, leashed by the carnal tirade
I choked when the cage bird sings it stings
Springs me up delirium to stitch the clipped wings
I sink instinctively brinked through while clinging the shrieking souls
Mourning the death of annal logs /analogs and quality control
Quality control, stand still string up the banner
From the beehive to the anthill; rag dummy
Incorporate the unison of Vikings Ship Rowers PLUS the perfection
Of the twice the Birds with half the Stone Throwers, speak your assessment
My communicative hindrance pleads the needs
Of a billion hungry victims gripped by the hell that's split to splinters
Shimmying up the mast of natives and it's league marvels
One component short of shock and mass burial, breeze
Broken penny bank fragments float up at stagnant seas
Dirty work plus applicants with chatter box disease
Iron bandit, giving the stars, the head balloons and rubies
Asked for many moons and I can't stand it any more
You might also like(Orson Welles)
Is that how I feel when I sling?
And the regulars were so amazed
*Record Scratch in*
I'm the mightiest slinger of them all!
There is a time for war and a time for peace
And a time to run and a time to split
*Record Scratch out*
"Getting dusty in the cellar"

I run a funny race, malnourished monarchs and loopy admirals
Where 99.9% swear by their broken axles
I built boats of a pack rat bats of bully club swung
Post utility inhalants nail it to stability and sail it
Lopsided starboard bow, crooked mass makeshift
Patching holes with chewing gum and sticking sail to dirty bases
Observe me sitting with my eyes tied to the clock, Cause
I know that once that wind kicks up you and your motors left rope to the dock
And it's the, art of clarity married to slender extension
Of blue sky over happy neighborhood
String on my ring has left me dancing like wooden dummies in a paper nature
Merry etiquette is a door nail, Friends is little brittle dolls of paper
In assembly, I tremble with a crocodile smile
Hiding a fish out of water complex provided upon entry
Now if I, were to fall to speeds
To levigate the game plan, would you honestly impede?
I mean I guess, I can just divorce me from the rest
And blame my chemical imbalance for the fact I've made a mess
But my loyalty supply hints on which inkling I should run with
And I'm thinking that damn town crier's about to fill this here bucket
It's that, grand precious that precious that part of you wants to touch
And part of you just wants to sit and be impressed with
Tainted agony induct in barnacle attachments
Mood swinging upon the barnstorm with perpendicular traffic
Spread, Circa 4000 circuitry burns cicada wings
Above alkadiene Townsman spoon-fed the shadow
I'm tired of being wired into the thief ratio
It's gnawing a hole through my scheme so I leave (know what I mean?)
It is the molotov cocktail hour
Haven't I brought you blessings without number?
*Record Scratch in*
They have plenty of nothing and nothing is plenty for them
Yea
I've never had it so good
*Record Scratch out*
