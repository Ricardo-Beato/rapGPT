23 Contributors9TH GRADE Lyrics
I can't have no convos with you now
I got confirmation numbers all across the fuckin' map, yeah
Tell me why you talkin' out your neck
You like to talk about your issues, I can't chalk it up to that

Chalk on the asphalt
Ass with the tan lines
I been wantin' you since 9th grade
It's about damn time
I don't wanna hear about your ex, keep it to yourself
I know that he like to send you texts, hope you doin' well
Pull up on me and you know the rest, tell me who you tell
Tell me she got real dreams, this just what she do for now
Bitch I'm feelin' juvenile
Got me jumpin' out the gym
I can't take it out the crib

Check the fridge, we out the skim
I feel like they out to get me
Heard you're tryin' see me six feet
Baby I can tell you're intrigued
Don't hide it, ain't no need for that
You the type I spend a long time with
Raw diamonds, wanna' get you raw diamonds
Jean jacket that she got from consignment
Novocaine, codependent with a coat of paint, oh yeah
I got code names for the things that I wanna do when we in the same space
You might also like
I can't have no convos with you now
I got confirmation numbers all across the fuckin' map, yeah
Tell me why you talkin' out your neck
You like to talk about your issues, I can't chalk it up to that

Chalk on the asphalt
Ass with the tan lines
I been wantin' you since 9th grade
It's about damn time
I don't wanna hear about your ex, keep it to yourself
I know that he like to send you texts, hope you doin' well
Pull up on me and you know the rest, tell me who you tell
Tell me she got real dreams, this just what she do for now
Bitch I'm feelin' juvenile
Got me jumpin' out the gym
I can't take it out the crib

Hold your breathe and count to ten
I don't want you pissed
She said I don't know what this is
I don't wanna dismiss that
But we can trust the process
I ain't with the nonsense
I don't check the contents
I got faith in humanity
She got ass like a manatee
That's a whole lot of ass if you askin' me
She said you got some audacity
Used to rap on Audacity
Don't let 'em back just 'cause they ask for me
'Cause I ain't in the mood for no conversation with 'ya
Said she had a great night but she forgot to take some pictures, ah damn
What a shame that is
Up right now, but we ain't changed a bit
I can't have no convos with you now
I got confirmation numbers all across the fuckin' map, yeah
Tell me why you talkin' out your neck
You like to talk about your issues, I can't chalk it up to that

Chalk on the asphalt
Ass with the tan lines
I been wantin' you since 9th grade
It's about damn time
I don't wanna hear about your ex, keep it to yourself
I know that he like to send you texts, hope you doin' well
Pull up on me and you know the rest, tell me who you tell
Tell me she got real dreams, this just what she do for now1Embed
