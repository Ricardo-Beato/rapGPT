20 ContributorsStolen Moments Pt. III Lyrics
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are

Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping
Somewhat like the girl X-rating
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacing
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breaking in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It's certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smoking weed
Thursdays his off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegetarian, she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story she was sticking
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bite
Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating
Are about as slim as he is, though I knew where he lived
In this house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we rolled, I told the guy turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck

-Just tell me why. Don't lie to me, man, just tell me why!
-It's the money, alright?
-Just tell me why!
-It's the fucking money, alright??

It ain't sweet when you do that shit
It ain't sweet when you do that shit
It ain't sweet when you do that shit
It ain't sweet when you do that shit
It ain't sweet when you do that shit
It ain't sweet when you do that shit
It ain't sweet when you do that shit1Embed
