20 ContributorsCanâ€™t Do It like Me Lyrics
Bitches better off leavin' their mans at the hotel waitin'
Playa's drinkin', posted up flingin' out bands
That's for them hoes be naked
Poppin' pussy, rollin' it, shakin' it
Smokin' hot, boiling pot
She got that cho-cha, that cobra, that clutch 'em up
I make 'em wild, I make 'em holla
I blow these niggas away now
Won't fuck a nigga twice
Smokin' aces, rollin' dice
Rice and peas on my hips and thighs
Python g-string hypnotize 'em
Motorboat, motorbike
You should be lucky I even acknowledge you
You should be lucky I shot you that alley-oop
You was just cruisin' the streets, nigga

Pretty A.B., them bitches can't do it like me (no way)
American dream, pussy be peppermint clean (okay)
You sweatin' that steez, I'm hot like a hundred degrees (okay)
Pretty A.B. bitches can't do it like me
Pretty A.B., them bitches can't do it like me (no way)
American dream, pussy be peppermint clean (okay)
You sweatin' that steez, I'm hot like a hundred degrees (okay)
Pretty A.B., y'all bitches can't do it like this
You might also like
Custom bodice, that bougie babe
That diva donna, that...
Chocolate bombshell, honey glazed
She bustin' out of her bustier
Rich niggas, what up?
Burn them fuckin' hundreds
Christian Lacroix fits, fill her pockets
Trips to the tropics, I want it
I let him spend this paper, but I never lick his lolli'
He eat my pussy out and sing to me like Champagne Papi
Lodi-dodi, now who gon' fuckin' stop me?
I'm chasin' the buck, I get it
That's why niggas got to watch me
Woke up in the projects, ended up in Tijuana
I had to fill my pockets, had to holla at my gualas
Dollars, commas, get it, the whole enchilada
Dame pesos, papi, tu prende nigga, copy
Shout out to my ockees and all my freaky hotties
Bitches gettin' money, smokin' like selassi
Let me rub them hundreds all over your body mami

Pretty A.B., bitches can't do it like me
Y'all bitches can't do it like me
Pretty A.B., bitches can't do it like, uh, uh
Y'all bitches can't do it like this
Pretty A.B., bitches can't do it like, uh
Y'all bitches can't do it like this3Embed
