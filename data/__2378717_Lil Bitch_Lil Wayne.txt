45 ContributorsLil Bitch Lyrics
No Ceilings
All my niggas clutchin'
All my niggas two-cuppin'
All my niggas rap and trap
They all got two phone numbers
Real one since day one
And all my niggas could vouch for me
None of my niggas lack in math
And all my niggas countin' money
Yeah

Pull up, banger on me
Bad bitch fainted on me
That purple drank stankin' on me
Don't wake me up, just put a blanket on me
Thank ya, homie, but I ain't ya homie
Diamonds blingin' like they blinkin' on me
All about the Ben Franklins, homie
Bitch can't even get an Abe Lincoln from me
Thinkin' normally, I ain't thinkin' normally
From New Orleans, guns bang in harmony
These little niggas is retarded
Puttin' testimony over sanctimony
All these niggas tryna sink the homie
Bitches tryna put the gangster on me
Feds tryna put sanctions on me
The doctor tryna do maintenance on me
Guess that's why I take  meds on 'em
Pop and sip and go to bed on 'em
New Ferrari, no head on it
Nice new carpet, you bled on it
These new artists no competition
Top of the charts no top of the menu
That ain't art, nigga drop the pencil
She drop the drawers, I never drop the pistol
But I drop the clip
And pull out a new clip
I'm not 'bout that lip
Bop-bop, nobody exempt
And you see the flaaag, as red as a bitch
You see the swaaag, I'm wavy and lit
My pops had them bricks, yeah, brick wall
My slime got them sticks, bop
And I can do tricks, yeah, skateboard
And my lil boo mixed, yeah
Just met her dad
Gave her momma a kiss
When she turned her back
I holla'd at sis
Yeah
Watch out lil bro
I fly G4
My slimes say I'm brazy, I used to talk to a globe
I tell it it's mine, I tell it "One day you be mine"
I tell the front page "You be mine"
I was locked up upstate for that iron
You know I'm comin' straight off the top
She knew I cum on her halter top
Cause she know I don't want no five children
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
Bitch, is you dykin' or not?
These niggas is wifin' the thots
I still got some white in my sock
As white as my sock
The white in her snot, uh
I know it could be anybody
So I prepare for everybody
We wavin' that thing at your body
We cravin' to catch us a body! Bop
Look at the watch on my friend
Say hello to my lil friend
My chopper due any day now
Bop-bop; that bitch just had twins
Lord, you run your mouth like a marathon
I just run out of them styrofoams
The Cialis give me testosterone
Now she got her legs on my collarbone
All on my neck like a herringbone
I had to sit down with Bizzy Bone
I had to sit down with Tity Boi
And told him just how I'mma kill his song
It's not a remix
It's just me, on my comeback and shit
I just unwrapped a brick
Put it on the scale, it come back thirty-six
It come back thirty-six
Then that's when we whip, we mastered the wrist
Then that's when it flip
Then after it flip, that's when it flip
You know what it's like when the feeling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
Watch out lil bitch
My partner got hitched
No influence
On me, it had no influence
I don't know my daaad, but my momma is rich
You see the red flaaag, but my partner a Crip
Damn! Watch out lil ho
Ooh, Pew, I fly G4
Ooh, you got jet laaag stuck at the airport
Damn, I'm in LA stuntin' on Melrose
Yeah, stuntin' on them hoes in them Yeezy's
Them Jeremy Scott's and Shelltoes
Okay!
I think I'mma need a check for shouting out Adidas like that
For real
