28 ContributorsBonnie & Clyde Freestyle Lyrics
Yo Hip-Hop, Is niggas still talkin bout I can't rap, come on now

Look for me, Young K
Took 2Pac beat and got paid
My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z
Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me
Now if you was my girlfriend, you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust, nigga ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying? Who the hell you trying?
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic?
My Answers cost 350, ya nah'mean?
Doesn't even have got her number, we ain't on the same team
You got the hat, the jacket, shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic, I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit, they always debt it
My girl come over, try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car, your credit worser than mine?
But every time I get a check, you be first up in line
Told you 'bout gold-diggin', bitch, it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact, we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit, that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer, a little thicker, a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter, so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now, bartender, two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend
You might also like
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend, me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end is me and my boyfriend, me and my boyfriend

I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's, no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles, just good times, like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough, we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach, we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach, told you I'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room
There's only one bedroom that I call my lair
We was V.I.P; Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend, yea, yea, yea, you was my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend, me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end is me and my boyfriend, me and my boyfriend
That's Right (Kanye)

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend, me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end is me and my boyfriend, me and my boyfriend
Yep!1Embed
