I fell in love, fell in love
But that's okay 'cause we in love
Oh my God, I fell in love
I fell in love with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in for the love
Just show me love, just show me love
I fell in love, I fell in love
And that's okay 'cause I'm in love

We in that bed, give me head
I want that just to stay
Close your eye, don't shed no tear
Keep it dark, close the shade
I'm off the pills, you on that lean
You fuck me slowly, uh, girl, do your thing
Let's take some pictures, let's take some scenes, huh
Playboy, huh, magazine, huh
She got her panties off with no T, huh
She got her titties out, she wanna tease, huh
She tatted up now, I see you see, huh
I know you see, I know you see I see
You know I want that bitch, I wanna eat, I eat
I wanna lick it up, I wanna fuckin' eat
I wanna freeze you up, I want them diamonds blingin'
I want it all on you, I want you all on me, ooh

I fell in love, fell in love
But that's okay 'cause we in love
Oh my God, I fell in love
I fell in love with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in for the love
Just show me love, just show me love

Lil' ma fly, she got a flock now
Got a squad now, got a drop now
She club hop, ayy, jewelry shoppin'
Girl, you shinin', girl, you fine, and yeah, you
Fine as wine, you ten like diamonds (Dime piece)
I treat you like my last dime
Go broke, uh, no joke, uh
I cut these hoes off, I kill the roll call
I put the doors up, she like to show off
Them bitches sleepy, them bitches dozed off
I put a ring on it, name got a ring to it
On my knees for you, watch me do it how he ain't do it
I cannot speak for you, but I know that he ain't fluent
I speak your language, he don't tell you things, do he?
Like girl, you dangerous, girl, I ain't seen beauty
Not 'til I seen you, gon' treat you like queen do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me sing to you, let this be the theme music, girl, I fell in love
I fell in love, fell in love
But that's okay 'cause we in love
Oh my God, I fell in love
I fell in love with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in for the love
Just show me love, just show me love
I fell in love, I fell in love
And that's okay 'cause I'm in love46Embed
