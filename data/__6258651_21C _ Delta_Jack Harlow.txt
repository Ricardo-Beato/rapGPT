41 Contributors21C / Delta Lyrics

(Don't get it)
(Yeah, we got room, we got room 'cause we fly)

First name, last name, date of birth (Date of birth)
Make a bad bitch sign paperwork (Oh yeah)
Once the ink dries, can't say a word
Just another day at work (Keep that)
Even though I love you, you should say it first (Say it to him)
She in med school, I wanna date a nurse (Yeah)
I know you been hurt, I don't wanna make it worse
But I know that I'm liable to make it worse, yup (Ooh)

Oh my, she's so fly (Fly)
Nine to five but she wanna be somebody (She needs some)
I can tell you need somebody (Some)
Put that thing on me, 'cause I need somеbody (Ah)
Girl, I'm at the 21c, come find me
I want you to bе the one I keep beside me
Baby, don't stop, can you keep massaging?
I know that you probably think I keep some thotties
You might also like
Yeah, yeah
But that's besides the point
Got the windows tinted, can't find your boy
Lock it down after hours at a private joint (Ooh)
They treat me different in the city, I'm the pride and joy
Got a couple old flames that I'm tryna avoid
Got a couple things with me she ain't tried before
But what you waitin' on?

Oh my, she's so fly (Fly)
Nine to five but she wanna be somebody (She needs some)
I can tell you need somebody (Some)
Put that thing on me, 'cause I need somebody
Girl, I'm at the 21c, come find me
I want you to be the one I keep beside me
Baby, don't stop, can you keep massaging?
I know that you probably think I—

First name, last name, date of birth (Date of birth)
Make a bad bitch sign paperwork
Once the ink dries, can't say a word (Word)
Just another day at work (Throw it to me)
Even though I love you, you should say it first (Say it to me)
She in med school, I wanna date a nurse (Do it to me)
I know you been hurt, I don't wanna make it worse
But I know that I'm liable to make it worse, yup, ah

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Ah-ah

I played you my first hit before it dropped
You were in the driver's seat and I was on the aux'
You made the stank face, that's how I knew it was hot
Lookin' back, I gotta wonder if you would have thought
That my life would've changed like this
That every station in America would play my shit
That I would do a remix and I could take my pick
Of any rappers that I wanted and they'd get on the shit
Hmm, I can't imagine you did
The way you see it, ain't no way that I don't have a new bitch
And it ain't fair, 'cause you know I got a whole lotta friends
That's gon' tell me who they seen you on the avenue with, uh
The playing field ain't level, that's how I engineered it
You don't know when I'ma pop up and when I'm disappearin'
Lately, it's been somethin' I don't really like in your spirit
Wallis Lane made the beat and Nickie Jon engineered it, uh

She ain't flyin' in Spirit
She's a Delta bitch, not the kind with the pyramids (Ah)
You got somethin' that I'm tryna experience (Uh)
Leavin' comments, got 'em all gettin' curious
Couple phone calls, now we callin' it serious
I say I'm in love when I fall for appearances
It's a lotta clubs tryna call for appearances
Last one I did, I caught a vibe with the bottle girl
Told her that, "I'm leavin', but I'll call when I'm here again"
That was West Virginia, don't know when I'll be there again
People in my circle wonder when I'll be arrogant
Feel like they can't wait to say I stepped out of character (Ah)
She said that she wanted me to take care of her (Nah)
She said she want me to London and Paris her
She said, "Do your thing," long as I don't embarrass her
Damn, I ain't even get to test out my character (Ah, ooh)

She ain't flyin' in Spirit
She's a Delta bitch, not the kind with the pyramids
You got somethin' that I'm tryna experience
Leavin' comments, got 'em all gettin' curious
Couple phone calls, now we callin' it serious
I say I'm in love when I fall for appearances
It's a lotta clubs tryna call for appearances
Last one I did, I caught a vibe with the bottle girl1Embed
