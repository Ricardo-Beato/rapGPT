Wop
808 Mafia
Southside and East Side
Gucci (We an army)

They call me peacoat shawty, left wrist eight-forty (Whoa)
Gucci Mane home ballin' while your bank account fallin’ (Damn)
Gucci Mane, I don't fear no one but God (On God)
For fifty mil' I’ll get in the ring and fight Floyd (Whoa, whoa)
Why these rappers dick ridin' so hard? (Huh?)
I ain't never backin' down, on God (On God)
Fresh out the mesh, that's three mil' and no call
I'm 'bout to go and buy a jet, that’s on God (That’s on God)
From East Atlanta, I can turn soft into hard, on God
That big advance check, I ain't even cash that yet, that’s on God
Where I grew up, all we did sell dope and rob, we on God
In the feds I didn't have no one but God, on God
Runnin' out of space in my garage so I'm thinkin’ 'bout (Whoa)
Buildin' another mansion out of town, am I crazy? (Go)
All these dead white men in my safe, I'm feelin' racist
Runnin' out of space in all my safe, I need some spaces
I asked Todd where he find me and Big Cat where he sign me (Cat)
Speaker phone on with the plug, I'm whippin' up a nine piece (Skrrt)
Fevzi made my jewelry, I'm standing next to QCP
I'm feelin' like they watchin' me, I think they wanna rob me
Haters lookin' envious, I'm lookin' at they faces (Fuck 'em)
I keep coppin' money, coppin' jets, and goin' places
Think I'm gettin' good 'cause I'm peepin' nationalities
My bitch changed her wig then she switched her personality (Wop)
You might also like
Protect yourself at all times, that's on God (God)
I don't do songs with my opps, that's on God (Fuck 'em)
I don't shake hand with my opps, that's on God (Pussy)
Spit in your face 'cause 1017, bitch, we a mob (Wop)
Protect yourself at all times, that's on God
I don't do songs with my opps, that's on God (No)
I don't shake hand with my opps, that's on God (They pussy)
Spit in your face 'cause 1017, bitch, we a mob
