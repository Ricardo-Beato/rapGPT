All Money In No Money Out
Neighborhood Nip Hussle
Bullets Ain't Got No Name Volume 2, nigga
That's all folks, until next time
I'ma leave y'all with this, man
Everybody wanna be somethin' out here
Everybody wanna have somethin' in life, right?
Lotta these niggas got the game twist
Thinkin' it's gon' come knock on they front door
Niggas better get up and go make that shit happen, my nigga
Feel me?
They gotta see that shit
Niggas gon' hate, niggas ain't gon' believe
They gotta get up and make that shit happen, my nigga
Or accept where you at, nigga, settle for broke
All Money In No Money Out, nigga
Take that and run wit' it
Get paper, nigga; stack now, ball later, fuck what they say, nigga
Get money and stay buckin', nigga
Nip Hussle, nigga, the underdog for real, homeboy
But look though, feel me? Hustle

Can I go on my way without you?
Whoa, how can I know?You might also likeEmbed
