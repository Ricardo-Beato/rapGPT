23 ContributorsDo You Think About Me Lyrics

D-D-Do you, do-do, do you think about me?
"Do you, do you, do you think about me?
Do you think, do you think, do-do-do you think about me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you think about me?

You think about money when you think about me, huh?
It's why my ex my ex, you don't wanna be her
She used to have the Beamer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eating lobster, now she eating pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you think about fronting
Think about stunting when you think about me
I'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?
Overseas see jet ski's slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course
I'm racing through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line and you're a friend of mine
Come on, let's ride
You might also like
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, every now and then
(Do you think about me?)
Goddamn girl, we used to be friends
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)

I think like a hustler, I'm thinking 'bout a shipment
She thinking I'm her hustler, she thinking 'bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head
He fell in love with a bitch who walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that, kid
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?"
This relationship shit is too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow mines on shopping spree's
She should have what she want, just not from me
I'm thinking 'bout my future, she brought up my past
She don't care about me, she just want some cash
I'm thinking damn, girl, we used to be friends
How did shit become all about ends?
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, every now and then
(Do you think about me?)
Goddamn girl, we used to be friends
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)

Do you think about me? (Do you think about me?)
I know you think about me
You got to remember all the good times we had
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)
I remember when you told me
(I know you think about me)
That I'll always be special to you, darling
You were so special to me, do you think about me?6Embed
