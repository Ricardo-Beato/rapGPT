5 ContributorsCome And Get You Lyrics
Don't make me come and get ya boy
The 40 Cal. will hit ya boy
Them hollow tips will split ya boy
So don't make come and get ya boy

Yeah flow slow, eye's low from the dro, push the glow
Pimp the hoes, throw them balls fancy cars, designer clothes
Gold coupe, new Vogues, big diamonds, white gold
You're fucking with a psycho, i write but you like though
Full clip, don't trip, Blood/Crip Gangster shit
Westside, Eastside, riders ride, cowards die
Cold world keep the heat with me when I'm in the street
Cos when you're starving, where I'm from, niggas learn to kill and eat
Ecstasy, Crystal meth, Marijuana, Cocaine
Man i got your drug of choice, here's a bundle or have a weight
Sniff or shoot G-Unit moves snorkels and thermos
My clientele is superior when will you learn, yo?

Don't make me come and get ya boy
The 40 Cal. will hit ya boy
Them hollow tips will split ya boy
So don't make come and get ya boy

Can't stop it, i am unstoppable!

Don't call me 50 Cent no more
Call me 50 Interscope Cent, Curtis Interscope Jackson
I'm runnin' this mothefucker! HahahaEmbed
