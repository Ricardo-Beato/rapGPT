I heard
*Burn one (x 2)*

I heard x4
That Gucci stacks the cheese up
You can just re-up gotta
Whole bunch of keys
About to sack tha weed up
I heard x4
That Gucci catch the prudent
Nigga it's a movement
Low Mojo everybody gotta kush pack

Yeah it feels tall that's ten million dollars
Gucci Mane La Flare I´ma pop my collar
I´ma trap scholar dawg
School of the hard knocks
Got them real hard blocks
On a real hard rock
Got damn low
You move that shit so fast
Mojo in tha jag
Nigga kiss my ass
You ain't ran out dawg
He ain't like you anyway
Then he fronted it to courtney
On the five way
Lil Charles´s outta chail
O.J. what you doin'
Trappin real hard you´s a bad influence
Gave the nigga ten
Came back the next day
Ask me for thirty
I didn't have nothin´ to say
Couldn't even catch the play
Hoes on the fucking road
Got the trap house doin' numbers ´bout to explode
What your trap doin' dawg
Show me with your watch
You gotta band on it
On a wrist that I don't 
Blue shorts dawg same
Color as the crips
Black diamonds in it
Same color as the clips
Green diamond eyes
Same color as the grips
Got tha Mak-90
In case the pussy nigga slip
See tha niggas keshaun
Country nigga deon
Any fucking way I´ma profit states of Argon
Turbo trap same speed as ya porshe is
Party pack of skittles
Same color as your forces
Got it kushed out
But it still don't amaze me
Million worth of jewels
If the jeweler apraise me
Go against the Gucc
Blad nigga you crazy
Got me a baby
Half on the payment
That mean I gotta whole lot of yayo to move
And I ain't even got nuttin else to do
You gotta trap doin' numbers
Man mine do too
I front da shit to tha shoe box
Then I get shoe box
And I keep two Glocks
And I got toolie
And my watch´s fruitie
I always wear the gucci
Louis top black dunks damn gucci mane
Hundred gram Gucci Mane in one band
You might also like
I heard x 4
That gucci stack the cheese up
You can just re-up
Gotta whole bunch of keys
About to sack the weed up
I heard x 4
Gucci catch the prudent
Nigga it's a movement
Low Mojo everybody gotta cush pack
I heardEmbed
