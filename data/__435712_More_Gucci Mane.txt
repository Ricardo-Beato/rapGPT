The affiliates, nigga

She wanna give it to me off in the living room
She wanna give me the business in the kitchen too
She knows my heart is cold because I’m ice cold
I’m gonna give her what she needs
I’m gonna get to the bedroom, turn the camera on
Then we can head to the shower with them candles on
She knows my heart is cold because I’m ice cold
I’m gonna give her what she needs

I work, you twerk your muscles, ma, let me be your trainer, shawty
Gucci Mane’s , hater, I’m your lady favorite artist
Smashed her in the laundry room, crushed her in the game room
From the den to the studio, she a damn fool
Freaky girl, I’m diggin’ you, is you horny like I’m horny?
Gucci, if you want me, just tell me what to do
When I, when I dialate it, we can go for hours, crazy
Bedroom to the shower, maybe
Make you sleep just like a baby

She wanna give it to me off in the living room (Yeah, yeah)
She wanna give me the business in the kitchen too (Where?)
She love m—
We switched positions, switchin’ rooms
Walkin’, switchin’, got her in my mansion walkin’ in the nude
I’m the one she give it to
You might also like
She wanna give it to me off in the living room (Yeah, yeah)
She wanna give me the business in the kitchen too (Where?)
She knows my heart is cold because I’m ice cold (Uh, uh)
I’m gonna give her what she needs
I’m gonna get to the bedroom, turn the camera on
Then we can head to the shower with them candles on
She knows my heart is cold because I’m ice cold
I’m gonna give her what she needs

I like it in the shower, I like it on the floor
Just give me more, more, more, I want more
I love it on the pool table, sometimes on the piano
Just give me more, more, more, I want more
Oh, oh, ya ya

Damn, I got her going, huh?
Gucci  make her say “Wow”
30 minutes in the kitchen, now we in the shower, uh
We can make a movie, sex in the jaccuzi, huh
Naw, shawty ain’t scared of me
Lil Gucci ain’t scared of her

She wanna give it to me off in the living room (Yeah, yeah)
She wanna give me the business in the kitchen too (Where?)
She knows my heart is cold because I’m ice cold (Uh, uh)
I’m gonna give her what she needs
I’m gonna get to the bedroom, turn the camera on
Then we can head to the shower with them candles on
She knows my heart is cold because I’m ice cold
I’m gonna give her what she needs
I’m gonna get you in the hot tub
Girl, I see you on the steps
I’ll give you more, more, more
I’ll give you more, more, more
Makin’ love up in the guest room
Put your legs up in the air
I’ll give you more, more, more (Gucci, Gucci)
I’ll give you more, more, more (It’s Gucci, It’s Gucci)

Crazy ‘bout gang, Gucci (Gucci, It’s Gucci)
Yeah, me n her have sex a lot
Freakin’ in the parkin’ lot (Wow, wow, wow, wow)
She too hot, too hot to drop
All around, everywhere, sex her in my favorite chair
Over here, over there, then I take her over there

She wanna give it to me off in the living room (Yeah, yeah)
She wanna give me the business in the kitchen too (Where?)
She knows my heart is cold because I’m ice cold (Uh, uh)
I’m gonna give her what she needs
I’m gonna get to the bedroom, turn the camera on
Then we can head to the shower with them candles on
She knows my heart is cold because I’m ice cold
I’m gonna give her what she needsEmbed
