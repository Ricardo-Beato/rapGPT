23 ContributorsNo Fuckin Wit Lyrics
No, No, no no
I ask shawty what's up and she wasn't fucking with me (she wasn't)
I told the plug to front me, he wasn't fucking with me (I swear he wasn't)
I swear I told her, they sit back and laugh at me (they was)
Now I'm Richie Rich, got these haters mad at me (rich!)

Lil' mama she weren't fucking with me (she wasn't)
Lil' mama she weren't fucking with me (she wasn't)
The plug he weren't fucking with me (he weren't fucking with me)
Lil' mama she weren't fucking with me (mama)
Lil' mama she weren't fucking with me (mama)
The plug he weren't fucking with me (he weren't fucking with me)
He weren't fucking with me
She weren't fucking with me, she weren't fucking with me
The plug he weren't fucking with me, weren't fucking with me
Lil' mama she weren't fucking with me, she weren't fucking with me

Nooo
Put it on my soul (put it on my soul)
It's quality control (QC!)
I came from kicking doors (Kick door fuck nigga)
Niggas never gave me shit, on the block working my wrist
Plug ain't front me shit, turn that ten to a whole 36 (flipping that)
Remember when I met that bitch (remember that bitch?)
She wasn't fucking with me
I tried to tell the plug to front me a bag, he wasn't fucking with me
They wasn't fucking with me and now that I'm rich
I don't wanna fuck with them

I told them I was gonna make it and they laughed
My teacher told me that I was gonna never pass math
Yeah she was right
80 thousand old hundreds, Jerry Rice
No I didn't get a diploma, I'm rich for life
They didn't believe me, BET, MTV, made you see it
Lil' mama she wasn't fucking with me
I had to go get some new bitches
The plug he wasn't fucking with me until I got all them Benjis

No you are not, fucking with me
When I ain't had no currency (where were you?)
You know you left a nigga hanging, treated me like I'm a stranger
The plug he wasn't even fronting me a key (fuck the plug)
But it's no pressure
I'ma take the little nick and I'll flip it, I'ma flex on you like a wrestler
Even since a nigga stopped fucking with you baby girl, my life been better (Too good)
And I'm successful, Michael Phelps in my bezzle
I did this on my own, with no helper (nobody)

Lil' mama she weren't fucking with me, she weren't fucking with me8Embed
