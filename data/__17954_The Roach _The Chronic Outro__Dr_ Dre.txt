50 ContributorsThe Roach  Lyrics
Cannabis Sativa, haha
Or in the heart of LA known as the chronic
Not to be confused with the bionic
Even though it does cost six million dollars, man, understand?
Haha, now we working with some new improved shit on this track
Nevertheless, not no stress, sucker-ass niggas
So now we're gon' move on and, uh, light a big fat one up for the world
And hit this once or twice and you'll be twice as nice
Get it? This is the chronic, haha
Blaze that motherfucker up then, nigga

Make my bud the chronic, I wants to get fucked up
Make my shit the chronic, I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the chronic, I gots to get fucked up
Make my bud the chronic before I take it home (Yeah)

Damn, my last joint, don't fuck with me, fool
Pass the bud
Who got the dub sacks?
I got it
Hoo-wee, this shorter than a motherfucker, man
You can take it or leave it, nigga
But I need a spliff right now
Roll this shit up then, nigga, and pass it
And I don't want no cess, brother
It's got to be the chronic, know what I mean, nigga?
Yeah, that's the chronic (Damn, it sure is), that's the chronic
That's the bomb bud (You ain't never lyin')
Now, get me a motherfuckin' Zig-Zag and we're straight
Yeah, nigga, I got some
Or better yet, a motherfuckin' blunt (I got that shit)
A Philly blunt that is
