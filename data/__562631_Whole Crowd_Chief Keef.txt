30 ContributorsWhole Crowd Lyrics
(Sosa on the beat)

I don't like lil' bets, I win whole pots (Ftftft, beep, whole pots, nigga)
I don't like lil' hoes, I get old thots (Old thots, bitch)
I like new guap and old guap (Old guap, bitch)
'Member letting tools pop in O'Block (bang bang, O'Block, bitch)
Ain't no more verses, that shit sold out (Ftftft, sold out, bitch)
I don't like white, nigga, bring that gold out (Bring that gold out, bitch)
Smoking on this green dope, it's so loud (It's so loud, bitch, Tooka)
I got enough Tooka for the whole crowd
(Dope, nigga, for the whole crowd bitch, dope, nigga)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Walk up in the show that shit sold out (That shit sold out, ftftft, beep)
And we walk up in the show with poles out (With poles out, grrah, bang)
Let a nigga try me, he get blown down (He get blown down, grrah, bang)
Referee whistle, I am so foul (Whistle, I am so foul, gang)
If you ain't know, nigga, now you know now (Now you know now, bang)
I'm in my BD stance, ten toes down (Ten toes down, 2-4, gang)
Life a roller coaster, bitch, it Glo 'round (It Glo 'round, bitch)
Went and scooped some kicks, finna go and scoop your hoe now (Scoop your hoe now, right now, nigga)
When I hit the bank, I am so proud (Ftftft, beep, beep)
Just got some money in and it so loud (Ftftft, beep ftftft, beep)
You smoke dirty weed, that ain't no loud (That ain't no dope, nigga)
Boy, that pack for kids, that is so childish (That is so childish, nigga)
Pull up on your bitch (Skrrt) then take off wild (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, take off wild)
I push it to the limit, I'm Rick Ross now (I'm Rick Ross now, gang, gang, bitch, ayy, gang, ayy, gang, ayy)
