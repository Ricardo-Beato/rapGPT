38 ContributorsFirst 48 Lyrics
I swear I watch first forty-eight all the time
Wonder if I'm gone be on there (Nah)

First 48
Get my Migo on the phone
Yeah, my Migo one call away, he'll pull a (First 48)
I ain't playing with these nigga's
Pull the chopper start spraying on these nigga's, pull a (First 48)
Young nigga's dying every night
Young nigga's mama crying every night
What that show call Rel? first 48
I swear to god, I don't want to do it
But I might have to do it, bout to do a (First 48)

Nigga's tried to hit me for my my chain (No way)
Can't let you do it, Lil' nigga
Cause I'm about to pull a first 48
Now they asking me, "Where is the pistol?"
If they find the pistol, I'ma get a life sentence
Take me to population, officer, I'm dressing out
They had no evidence, in the first forty-eight they let me out

First 48
Get my Migo on the phone
Yeah, my Migo one call away, he'll pull a first 48
I ain't playing with these nigga's
Pull the chopper start spraying on these nigga's, pull a first 48 (Yeah)
Young nigga's dying every night
Young nigga's mama crying every night
What that show call Rel? First 48 (Yeah)
I swear to god, I don't want to do it
But I might have to do it, bout to do a first 48

What the fuck? Who that is outside?
Pulled in my driveway, it's really late
They parked in, man, I cannot see the tag
But I see a badge, 12, time to shake
Fuck, I rush out my backdoor
Trying to grab all of my cash flow
Jumping these fences don't know where to go
If I get caught, I get down on my knees and repent
But what's a case if they ain't got no evidence

First 48
Get my Migo on the phone
Yeah, my Migo one call away, he'll pull a first 48
I ain't playing with these nigga's
Pull the chopper start spraying on these nigga's, pull a first 48
Young nigga's dying every night
Young nigga's mama crying every night
What that show call Rel? First 48
I swear to god, I don't want to do it
But I might have to do it, bout to do a first 48

I am no killer but nigga you pushed me
Pussy nigga thought a nigga was rookie, hit me for the cookies
It's okay, I'ma catch a nigga in the alleyway (Catch his ass)
Hundred round under the K
Nigga feel my pain
I just caught a case, the police saying they knowing my name
They knowing the fame, and the chains
It's part of the game (It is)
You run in my trap, the chopper going to hit you harder than a train
The witness is who you going to blame
No Damon Wayans, I'm bringing the Major Payne
First 48
Get my Migo on the phone
Yeah, my Migo one call away, he'll pull a first 48
I ain't playing with these nigga's
Pull the chopper start spraying on these nigga's, pull a first 48
Young nigga's dying every night
Young nigga's mama crying every night
What that show call Rel? First 48
I swear to god I don't want to do it
But I might have to do it, bout to do a first 48 (Don't)
First 48 (Don't)44Embed
