Uh, bro
I'm in a studio with Max and Lotti
And, yeah
Three Musketeers
Hey, baby

No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
Come here
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
Know you a ho, you buy your soul, I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go, go, oh

You can bury me with her
And if she die before me, kill me and carry me with her
Know if I die before her, lil' shorty dyin' a widow
Let's not walk down that road
Forever's forever, eternally attached to her soul (Oh)
Oh my God, I thank God for her smile
She too fine, I'm too wild
When I fall, she taps out
Let's get a house and settle down
Let's have a child, watch 'em run around
I'm at my all-time high now
You're my sunshine through life's rainclouds
You might also like
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
Know you a ho, you buy your soul, I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go, go, oh

They tell me life is a riddle
I found the answers on her tongue in the middle of kissin'
I swear to God she can't do wrong
Wait, what if I'm trippin'?
Makin' brash decisions
That's what they tell me, but they don't get it, can't grasp the image
Cashin' it, I'm past bitches, in a love with a woman
She past drippy, the Gucci slippers, Versace linens
I'll take her out to dinner, she usually hibachi grillin'
Poppin' and raillin' the last of the Perkys before we kick 'em
You keep me hope, my antidote
You are my dope, addiction soul
Addictin' soul, that's you, my love
Can't get enough
I need to feel your touch
I need to feel your touch
I can't get enough
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
Know you a ho, you buy your soul, I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go, go, oh21Embed
