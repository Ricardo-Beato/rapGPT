30 ContributorsStart Pimpin’ Lyrics
They call me Gucci the Don, the best that ever did it
I'm dressed in Louis Vuitton, they say I overspend it
I just got out on a bond, they know I got the millies
And if I lift up my arm then it get really chilly
Ring cost a pretty penny, they say I’m getting skinny
But there ain’t nothing skinny bout Gucci but them things on my Bentley
The center of attention
I got a new invention
It cost me 95 thou, but it’s only five inches
I got on 95’s now and I’m counting up five millies
And if you snitching then nigga you need to stay your distance
I was worth two mill when I went and bought that Bart Simpson
Done fucked with so many women I need to start pimping

Start pimping, I need to start pimping
Done fucked with so many women I need to start pimping
Start pimping, I need to start pimping
Done fucked with so many women I need to start pimping
I need to start pimping

Hoes think I’m a pimp cause I walk with a limp
No, the pistol on my hip, that’s why I walk with a limp
Water your block,  disguised like a pimp
Squeeze this trigger, bullets bust a nigga’s pimple
I am Glo Gang, and I'm a champ
Caught your thot like pimp
Chop come through and slam, niggas
Duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh, blam, niggas!
I ain’t worried bout nothing niggas
Scooterska-scooterska damn, nigga
30 up in this damn nigga
Rugerda-rugerda ham nigga
Killer season like Cam, nigga
Don’t disrespect like Pam, nigga
Come through your block, fuck Pam nigga
Bullets stick to a nigga’s damn liver
Crip walk I can't
Ay, blood gang I am
