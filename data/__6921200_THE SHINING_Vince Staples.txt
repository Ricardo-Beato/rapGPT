Yeah, 65th Street, nigga
Park side, Cherry side, all that (Yeah)

Don't get murdered (Don't slip)
Yeah, lil' niggas out here with no purpose
Loaded, lurking, huh (Yeah, lurkin')
They rather get flipped than go flip burgers (Okay)
Cayenne swerving, huh (Swervin')
Niggas ain't built like that in person
City burning, huh (Burn it down, it's down)
Can't be saved with no sermon (Hell nah, yeah)
Still in search of (Yeah), ain't no N.E.R.D.​ (Uh-uh)
Left some enemies on that curb (Uh-huh)
I cannot be perturbed (Man, I'm sorry)
I live out evеry word (Uh-huh) I put inside my verse (You know it)
I know my mama proud (You know mе, Mama, what's up?)
These haters wanna down me (You know where I'm at with it), please

It's not what you think (It ain't that at all, the fuck)
I could be gone in a blink, I don't wanna leave (Don't, we gone)
Yeah, it's not what you thought (What you thought, thought this shit was)
We dying broke or live with broken hearts (Let's go, yeah)
Blower with a beam (Hundred shots, boom)
Shine when I hit the scene (Shine, thirty shots, fifteen shots, yeah)
Blower with a beam (With a beam, seven shots, boom)
Shine when I hit the scene (Yeah, five shots, six shots)

Greener grasses (Get paid)
Made it out, don't make shit for the masses
When in traffic (Still hang)
No, you can't be givin’ out no passes (Hell nah)
Fuck a mansion (You lame, yah)
Asked when I'ma move to Malibu or Calabasas (Hell nah, you lame)
I can't never do it, I'm too active
She attractive (Huh?), but she plastic
I can't get with that shit (Uh-uh)
She the baddest (How? Huh?)
But out here doing bad, how'd that happen? (How? Huh?)
Yes, he rapping, but he ain't got no bag
How'd that happen? (Ain't got no bag on that man)
Yes, I'm cracking, but hard to understand how it happened (Yup, I don't know what to tell y'all)

It's not what you think (It ain't that at all, the fuck)
I could be gone in a blink (Close your eyes, nigga in that grave)
I don't wanna leave (Don't, we gone)
Yeah, it's not what you thought (Six feet, thought this shit was—)
We dying broke or live with broken hearts (Let's go, yeah)
Blower with a beam (With a beam, hundred shots, boom)
Shine when I hit the scene (Shine, thirty shots, fifteen shots, yeah)
Blower with a beam (With a beam, seven shots, boom)
Shine when I hit the scene (Yeah, hit the scene, hit the scene)
