6 ContributorsNighttrain (Pete Rock Strong Island Mix) Lyrics
Land of the free but the skin I'm in identifies me
So the people around me energize me
Callin' all aboard this train ride
Talkin' 'bout raw hardcore, leavin' frauds on the outside
But the bad thing is anyone can ride the train
And the reason for that is cause we look the same
Lookin' all around at my so-called friend
Light skin to the brown, the black, here we go again
Homey over there knows Keith and but he be thiefin'
I don't trust him, rather bust 'em up
Out goes his hand and I cough
He once stole from me; yeah, I wanna cut it off
The black thing is a ride I call the nighttrain
It rides the good and the bad, we call the monkey trained
Trained to attack the black it's true
Cause some of them look just like you

Stayin' on the scene, sittin' on the train
See all the faces look about the same
There go the sellout who's takin' a ride like Cargo
Cause he deal the keys from Key Largo
Runnin' Nat narcotic, by George he got it
Takin' makin' the G erotic
And the fiends they scheme so he can put 'em down
But his method is wreck 'em, put 'em in tha ground
Got tha nerve as hell to yell brother man
He ain't black man cuz he ate his Pac Man
Known to murder his own, traitor on the phone
Ridin' the train, self-hater trained to sell pain
The master's toy, little boy
Hard to avoid he look wit' it but he null 'n' void
Cause he ridin' the train you think he down for the cause
Cause his face looks just like yours

The conductor, track the structure overstood
Nighttrain the plain, little engine that could
One express so let's next stops Mecca
A place to face to make a black man better
CL and Chuck D, we don't talk rubbage
But just like a slave, we gotta ride wit the luggage
On the nighttrain

More of the same insane who sayin' like flowin'
Like nighttrain, runnin' the pain of the black reign
You look, you laugh, you doubt and go out and I'm gone
But the bass goes on
To talk the talk, but walk the walk, the king of New York
Crack a lack attack the black to crack the back
Once again I test a friend with sincerity
Or consider him an enemy
Who am I to tell a lie
Rather push the Bush
Hope da cracker get crushed
I'm rollin' wit Rush
Leader of the bum rush
Russian I ain't spreadin' like paint
Lookin' at the put I got and its kickin'
But it ain't chicken but it's livin' for a city
So sick and tired
Of a scene buckwild, piled in a file
Senile or chile
They said it never been no worser than this
I'm on the nighttrain, they hope ya don't miss it
Give ya what they gotta give you just go
You musn't just put your trust in every brother yo
Some don't give a damn
Cause they the other man
Worse than a bomb
Posin' as Uncle Toms
Disgracin' the race and blowin' up the whole crew
With some of them lookin' just like you1Embed
