Hey
All this money out here
Gotta get it
Price so cheap

When it's winter time I fly to where is summer time
Spend a hundred grand at any given time of day
So much cash on me you think I robbed an armored truck
Smoking kush in front of 12 like we don't give a fuck
Want some trap shit you came to the right place
In the Peach State trafficking these Cali grapes
I'm a king I swear that I should play for Sacramento
Put a hit on you your ho all and the fucking kin too
Treat my cars just like my house put curtains on all my window
So much codeine in this sprite it look like Pepto-Bismol
Miss me with all of that gossip and that innuendo
They say my diamond chain is ill they say that I'm a sicko
Made a hundred thousand dollars standing at the Citgo
You bust it up and you see crystals sparkling in the middle
And I never stopped jugging nigga cause I'm not a quitter
And when I hit the club I hit it with a bunch of killers
You might also like
My mama gave birth to a trap boy, trap boy
Then trap boy then turned into a dope man, dope man
Gucci man la Flare I got old money, old money
And I'm a be a hustlin' ass old man, old man
This one dedicated to the dope boys
Price so low I'm at a loss for words
I know you nigga heard I got them Georgia birds
23 5 Nigga spread the word

Fuck with me you know I got the Charlie Sheen
Hundread pints of purple that's a lot of lean
Got 2000 pounds of swag like I cut the grass
He said the robbing crew snatched me but that made me laugh
So many bank rolls in my robin pockets bout to bust
Walking trought the mall and I'm smelling like a pound of kush
I got thirty grand on me and a .40 Cal
I'm in a Louie V store signing autographs
My plug text me said it just came
I text him back my nigga I'll be on my way
I'm selling more scale than Spondivits
Got a four bedroom with like twelve kitchen
And ain't no broke niggas coming to my house
Got that white girl call her Amy Winehouse
Old school '74 costs a townhouse
Better bring 'em pounds before I bring the 9 out
My mama gave birth to a trap boy (trap boy)
That trap boy done turned into a dope man (dope man)
Gucci Mane La Flare I got old money (old money)
And Imma be a hustlin' ass old man (old man)
This one dedicated to the dope boys
Price so low I'm at a loss for words
I know you nigga heard I got them Goergia birds
23.5 Nigga spread the word
Holiday Season Nigga
My mama gave birth to a trap boy (trap boy)
Then trap boy then turned into a dope man2Embed
