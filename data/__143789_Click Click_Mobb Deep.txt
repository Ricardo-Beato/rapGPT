Yeah
Uh
Uh-huh (yeah)
(Yeah)

We get that paper baby boy, it's easy
You want to be who? You can't be me
Shorty gave me that ass on GP
I'm rolling in a G-500 or the Porsche, roof open
And I know that you're hoping that I fall real soon
But I ain't going nowhere, hate to bust your balloon
And there ain't that much room for all us
Limited space, the game like a tour bus
I won't break, I just take, take and take
Rape and rape, the game 'til there's no more cake
Snitch ass niggas giving up identities
Ain't my fault they making pennies
They soft like ice cream, sweeter than Ben & Jerry's
Like Hoffa, leave him nowhere to be found, but buried
The gun won't fail me, the money won't leave me
Stop scheming on me, baby, cause it ain't that easy
Niggas leave prints cause their palms so greasy
Their mind read easy, I see right through 'em
The AK'll do 'em, like nobody do 'em, don't stop
It's best that you keep it moving, you'll get shot
You might also like
We ain't licking niggas, we ain't busting shots in the air
No warning shots, the fuck out of here
Oh man, homie, hate to do you like this
Oh man, homie, when the tooley go click, click, click
We ain't licking niggas, we ain't busting shots in the air
No warning shots, the fuck out of here
Oh man, homie, hate to do you like this
Oh man, homie, when the tooley go click, click, click

It's the young high-roller, the talk of New York
David got my neck looking like a lightning bolt
I'm in that two-door Range Stormer, my truck plush
And the wheels are the size of rims on a school bus
I need that Bill Gates money, that's fifty-one billion
Six hundred ki's, that's fifty-one million
Me and 50 in Hollywood, with Quincy Jones
Since the Feds bought Nextel, I trashed my phone
Listen homes, everything glisten homes
Yeah, my gun and my rims both sit on chrome
You move your weight in the car, I move weight by the cargo
I dropped in Marcy in a Murcielago
My connect is a Cuban named Flaco
With my aim, you a human taco
Meeting shells, yo the feds tryna peep our sales
My daughter grow up, she in Harvard and Yale, yeah
We ain't licking niggas, we ain't busting shots in the air
No warning shots, the fuck out of here
Oh man, homie, hate to do you like this
Oh man, homie, when the tooley go click, click, click
We ain't licking niggas, we ain't busting shots in the air
No warning shots, the fuck out of here
Oh man, homie, hate to do you like this
Oh man, homie, when the tooley go click, click, click

You see me rolling, Mac-10 showing out the window
When you catching me shooting out the Coupe, then switch your lane
You don't want me creeping two miles an hour, with my seat low
Cause I'll hop up out the sunroof with fully-autos and embed it in your brain

It's like fee, fie, foe, fum
I smell the blood of a jealous ass punk
One, two, three hundred shots
Finna ring off them things off, and cook the block
Old people, the pets and the kids
Whoever in the way, them strays gon' hit
And we don't give a fuck about the police, nigga
This ain't Manhattan, this Queens, nigga
We're immune to the violence, it's nothing to me
Fuck 'em, they don't give a fuck about P
If they could kill me, believe me, they would
That's why I set it off, and I get 'em real good
When them street, lights, come on, nigga
You best, have, your gun on, nigga
Cause tonight we ride and you die
As soon as I walk up, or drive-by (yeah)
We ain't licking niggas, we ain't busting shots in the air
No warning shots, the fuck out of here
Oh man, homie, hate to do you like this
Oh man, homie, when the tooley go click, click, click
We ain't licking niggas, we ain't busting shots in the air
No warning shots, the fuck out of here
Oh man, homie, hate to do you like this
Oh man, homie, when the tooley go click, click, clickEmbed
