38 ContributorsNastradamus Lyrics

Uh, 2000 G

Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball 'till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
'Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scaring 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse
While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is doo-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street 'til I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearing a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus

I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spending your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills
Our honeys wearing Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech
Uh

Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's on the throne
And we gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp, laid and max now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
Now how did one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But all in one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Ill Will
