9 ContributorsDope Love Lyrics
Huh, huh, huh
I said I don't give a damn
I wouldn't give a damn
Professional, I'm professional
No petitionin'
No tint on there
You can look in here, my bitch just changed her hair

I think she the one
Yellow Forigis same color of her panties, but she don't have them on

I don't give a damn 'bout them other hoes

I love the girl more than a junkie love dope
We got that dope love
That dope love, dope love
Dope, dope, dope love
That dope love, dope love

I got a half a pound of purp if you wanna smoke
If the shit don't work, I'mma let you go

I got dope love
Dope dick when I bust her up
I got big dough, big bank won't fold up
Talkin' big 'dro, OG gas in my pantry, girl
I'mma hit her on the stove, water whip
You want that Benz car?

She silent as a 
You fuckboys
We got that dope love

I don't give a damn 'bout them other hoes
I need a trap girl who can work a stove
I need a bitch to bring 'em in rain, sleet, or snow
A baby chopper in her purse and a brick of dope
She took the charge for a nigga, shawty never told
I love the girl more than a junkie love dope
We got that dope love
That dope love, dope love
Dope, dope, dope love
That dope love, dope loveEmbed
