44 ContributorsPretty (SS2) Lyrics
1Mind

I stroll through cities, gang, they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem I have is always 'bout you
Oh

Beautiful soul with good energy
I kept it real with you, never pretend to be anything that I was not
I just want you at my spot
I just want you with me now
Where are you now? Tell me what town
Fly you up out of your city
Just so that I can look at you and tell you you're pretty, you know
So many thoughts that I have
Just wanna take you and show yo' ass off to my city
You lookin' so pretty, you act so sadity
I love when you with me, you shittin' on bitches
Oh, you shittin' on bitches
And when we together, we shittin' on every Mr. and Mrs
Ain't no bitch nowhere that could replace your kisses
You put Lil' Boat in his zone, I'll never leave you alone
Pack up your bags and come to my city
I'll move you right into my home
And I fuck with you 'cause, babygirl, you is never running through my phone
You might also like
I stroll through cities, gang, they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem I have is always 'bout you
Oh

I know you done been through a lot
But trust me when I say that I’m there for you
I know you done been through the pain and the struggle
So, baby, just let me take care of you
We can go fly off to Paris
We could double date with Perry
We can make love on a ferry
Buy you the shoes where the heels red like cherries, oh
And when you havin' a bad day
I'll hold you tight straight through the night
Cheer you up when you be down
We can go run up the town
I work so hard just so that we can flex on 'em
Like look at me now
Tried to shit on me back then
That was back then, I remember when
Fuck 'em we ball, it's just me and you
Never need nobody, pull off in big body
Queen of my life, girl, I see you
Girl, I promise that I need you
I stroll through cities, gang, they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem I have is always 'bout you
Oh

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Let me take care of you
We should make
One and one equal two, whoa-whoa-whoa
Never been a fan of goodbye
Rather put two and two together like x and y
Want you there every morning to tie my ties
'Cause being with you is like being on a wild roller coaster ride
How many nights can I go without seeing your pretty face?
We could do it anywhere, you pick the time and the place
You’re my little freak, I always want you in my space
Every moment I spend with you, there's nothing I'd erase

I stroll through cities, gang, they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem I have is always 'bout you
Oh
Don't you fall on me, babygirl
Stand tall for me, babygirl
Don't you evolve on me, babygirl
Oh, oh
Please don't you fall on me, babygirl
Please stand tall for me, babygirl
Don't you evolve on me, babygirl
Oh, oh, oh
You mean it all to me, babygirl
Don't you fall on me, babygirl
Stand tall for me, babygirl
Oh, oh, oh
You don't do nothing
Don't you evolve2Embed
