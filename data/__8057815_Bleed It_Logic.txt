(Bleed that, back when I—)
(Bleed that, think I'm too)
(Bleed that, you be like)
(Bleed that, with, with)
(Bleed that, back when I—)
(Bleed that, think I'm too)

(There ain't life)

Bob chillin' with my mom watching Ten Commandments
Got a bottle in her hand and I'm facin' abandonment
Social services fuckin' up my vibe
Smile for the worker, but I'm dyin' on the inside
Haha, haha, everything's fine
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind
I've seen a lot of shit in my lifetime
Playin' the field, man, I need anothеr lifeline
Fifty-fifty, I was born to be a fuck-up
What up? Always been mysеlf, so shut the fuck up
I bleed it, I fuckin' bleed it
I bleed it, I fuckin' bleed it
Pick up the pen, then I bleed it (I bleed it)
A criminal I was in my past life
Nothing but women and drugs, it was a fast life (Bleed that)
I got 9-1-1 on FaceTime
Walkin' in the bank, Glock .9 on my waistline
Empty the clip, fuck no, I never waste time
Grab the cash then dash to the baseline (Bleed that)
You might also like
I bleed it, I fuckin' bleed it
I bleed it, you know I bleed it
I bleed it, I fuckin' bleed it
Pick up the pen, then I bleed it

I once was a loser, a failure
Drownin' in the sea of my sorrows as a sailor
Lookin' for land, feelin' down as a man
Prayin' up to God, lookin' down at me, man
Thinkin' of all of the songs I never sung
That's the day I died while you're fillin' up my lungs
In another life I was a killer
Psychopathic, schizophrenic population filler
Livin' in the background, livin' in the shadows
Waitin' for the rest of the world to decompose
'Til I put a bullet in my head
Now the life that I live is as a sinner
Just a human being, a professional beginner
I was never a winner but I won some
'Cause everybody loses where I come from

I bleed it, I fuckin' bleed it
I bleed it, you know I bleed it
I bleed it, I fuckin' bleed it
Pick up the pen, then I bleed it
(Bleed that, back when I—)
(Bleed that, think I'm too)
(Bleed that, you be like)
(Bleed that, with, with)
(Bleed that, back when I—)
(Bleed that, think I'm too)
(Bleed that, you be like)
(There ain't life, no, no)
