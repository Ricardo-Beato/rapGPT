14 ContributorsH-Town Lyrics
H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt

Bitch, I’m makin' moves, 6 on 22’s
Walk inside my house, all you see is views
Flat screens on the wall, white folks in the hall
Make 100 racks and tell my bitch to count it all
It was us against the odds 'til niggas played they cards
All we did was ball, look how they did my dog
All these pretty broads, all these foreign cars
Made a grip to lose it all, it was the rise before the fall
But I’m still going
H-town in my cup, kush still blowin'
Strike my niggas up, they know it’s still Rollin'
Crenshaw on my shirt, they see they boy blowin'

H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt

Every time that I go, niggas know that I go off
Pull up in that white Benz, yeah, baby, I’m a show off
And all my niggas salute me, like a nigga was Adolf
Hitler, you better hide yo bitch ‘cause I’ll hit her, I’ll get her
Nigga and I bet you you'll miss her, I don’t want her
But if a nigga did then she a goner
But man I’ma gonna hit a corner
Take a hit of this weed and sippin' some of this pour up
Got niggas salty at me ‘cause yo' dream bitch is my main slut
These diamonds heavy on me and yo' baby mama, she wanna fuck
Her homegirl Tiffany, nigga, you know she wanna come
Come and roll with me, what you call that? A threesome

H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt

Tell her it’s my turn, then watch the girl get turned on
Some zig zags and OG, it’s time to get my burn on
I make her shake that ass but she ain’t have no skirt on
I do it just like Pac, nigga I ain’t had no shirt on
My money come in lumps, love only come once
You the nigga she got, but I’m the nigga she want
I told er leave on the pumps, ‘cause it’s a perfect occasion
Her body lookin' amazing and my pockets looking Caucasian
And you niggas salty at me but I’ll slap your face off
Then I'll buy your job, then you gonna get laid off
Make 35 million, then I’m just gon' shade off
By 2015, nigga, I'll be paid off, 'cause
H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt

I keep that purple all in my bitch, money up and just lift
Slow paper, off spit
Get mo' paper off pitch
Got a Hublot on my wrist, bad bitch on my dick
Cartiers on my eyes and got my clear sight on my grip
It’s that Dom, Cobby, and Nip, add me on that here
That Westside still the best side, got a Mac 11 on hip
I sip that same shit that killed Pimp
Same shit that killed Screw
Got these dollars split with my crew
Plus we stay shittin', PU
PS, we just, the best, Khaled
That’s that Louis, that’s Cliquot, Balenciagas and Ballys
This that pistols and palm trees, my palm raise a profit
Saw that Westside and then locked it
Got your girl heart in my pocket, word
H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt
Keep that H-town in my cup, OG in my blunt
Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stunt3Embed
