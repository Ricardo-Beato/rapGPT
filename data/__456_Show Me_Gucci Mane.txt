10 ContributorsShow Me Lyrics
See, I could've retired a long time ago
I mean, it's not like I need the money
Or the credentials
But Gucci said it could only be one director for this movie
Like, for an example
If you think about them other DJs
How many classics theirs can you name?
Now try to name one my classics
You feel me?
DJ Drama, fuck these niggas up

Bend your back, flip your shoulders (Yeah, yeah), drop your head, bust it open (Bust it, bust)
If you love it like you say you love it, baby girl, show me (Gangsta)
Show me somethin', show me somethin'
Show me somethin', show me somethin'
Show me somethin', show me somethin'
Show me somethin', show me somethin' (Gangsta Grillz)
She got that back bent, shoulders good, got it busted open (Huh, huh, huh, phew)
Said "If you want it, come and get it, Gucci Mane, show me" (Phew, phew, phew)
Show me somethin', show me somethin'
Show me somethin', show me somethin'
Show me somethin', show me somethin'
Show me somethin', show me somethin' (The Aphilliates, nigga)

You know I'll do it, sure I'll do it, show me somethin', girl
Call me Gucci Mane La Flare, my name ring on around the world (Around the world)
Buy you diamonds, buy you purses, potential to be my Gucci girl (Gucci)
Take you to the Gucci shop, we call this shit the Gucci world (Uh, uh)
Word, the Louis shop, you'll be my Louis girl
Buy you Louis, buy you Prada, girl, you look just like a model
Model, we be poppin' bottles? Nah, we be poppin' cases
Gucci Mane La Flare got lawyers to fight all the cases
Hundred thousand dollar car, fifty-carat bracelets
Half a million for the chain, Gucci Mane crazy (Ayy)
Pull up in an '08, lookin' like a stingray
Eatin' calamari in my brand new Ferarri
Sorry, steppin' on your fins with my Maurras
Got a nasty model 'cause it ain't about the dollars
Starin', starin', it's apparent that they starin' (Yeah)
Starin' at me, girl, I'm fresher than this Ralph Lauren, ooh (Ooh)

Shorty wanna marry me, say she don't have sex casually
Don't wan' be a casualty, got a faculty
Got more Magnums than an infantry
Baby, that's the penalty and trappin' is just energy (Yeah, yeah)
Gucci Mane La Flare, you can call me Guccirace (Guccirace)
Million dollar shine, call me Gucci Dibiase (Uh)
Like Ted Dibiase, put you in the figure four
Gucci Mane La Flare, my car is on some twenty-fours

Hoes on the Maserati, oh, kimosabe (Oh, kimosabe)
Got them bitches in the lobby and they waiting on Guccirace (Guccirace)
I got hoes on the Maserati, oh, kimosabe (Oh)
Got them bitches in the lobby and they waiting on Guccirace

Bend your back, flip your shoulders (Yeah, yeah), drop your head, bust it open (Bust it, bust)
