Niggas wanna do it
Nigga, fuck it, let’s do it
See, this is what I do
So there ain’t nothin’ to it
If the conversation trap
Speak that fluent
In the club blowing money
Like I motherfuckin’ grew it

You see me stylin’ on your bitch ass
You see me stylin’ on your bitch ass
You see me stylin’ on your bitch ass
You see me stylin’ on your bitch ass

Gon’ step in this bitch
And I got plenty to blow
Tuck your chain and tuck your bottles
If you smart you’ll tuck your ho
These niggas know they ain’t fuckin’ with your Mr. Snow
I swear I get a buzz every time you talk blow
I’m killin’ myself
I am killin’ this shit
Don’t make me go there
Spend a mil in this bitch
See I hop in that Ferrari like I’m still in this bitch
The sun came up
And we still in this bitch

Time’s up, take off the top
There it is, a half a block
And the grind is never-ending
Man, I swear it never stops
But you got a hundred thousand niggas shooting at your spot
“You the best that ever did it, ever done it” thanks a lot
If the subject drug-related then you know I’m going in
If they 25 a piece then you know I’m buying ten
If they find them chickens at your house
Your ass is going to jail
If you can’t weigh it with your eyes
You actually need a scale


Damn right it’s all true
Paid dues and made moves
I stay away from niggas
Heard them niggas bad news
Say the street committee say them niggas tellin’ on the streets
Got the nerve to hate on you
You know when that shit is weak
Top down, pistol out, you know I’m on the creep
Looking for a stylin’ redbone
I hope that she a freak
If that pussy good as I think it is I’mma tweak
Got on with the head doctor
And the bill won’t let me sleep

I’m killin’ myself
I am killin’ this shit
The grind is never-evening
Man, I swear it don’t stop
I’m killin’ myself
I am killin’ this shit
Don’t make me go there

I just changed, from one day to the next
I grew tired of everything
So, I decided to express my frustrations
You know what the thing about revolutions is?
You don't plan them, I didn't at least
There just happened to be alot of people that agreed with me
I happen to be the voice that spoke
They called me El Jefe

Niggas wanna go , we can go nigga I’m talking head up
Sick and tired of the bullshit and now I’m fed up
Hatin’ on another grown man get your bread up
If your bread down, nigga, then keep your head up

Ye I know ya’ll feel, is that nigga really real?

Got a whole one from my partner one time he charged me thirty
Got a nigga wanted 2 way I need another birdy
I’m a genius when it comes to gettin money; kinda nerdy
Started counting at 6:15 be done by 7:30
If your subject is some real shit, you know I’m goin ham
Keep your opinions and your comments niggas I can’t give a damn

I wasn’t surprised to find my enemies
I could see the "el odio” in their eyes
They wanted to stomp me for my accomplishments
I thank them though, because without them, I wouldn’t have no one to stand above

Say, that’s the way it is
That’s the way it’s gonna be
Won’t be happy till I’m in the same place as Max B
For them niggas do your thing dog you know how cats be
Anything you wanna know about them things just ask me
See I might be from the ghetto but I’m gonna be classy
You can hate it if you want but I’m gonna be flashy
See I do it for the time that I was broke and ashy
Bitches say you want them clothes all week ,you nasty
See Pac said it best , real niggas don’t die
How you niggas so opinionated you don’t know the guy
If you think you’re going forward then you don’t know the guy
If you thinking there’s a limit then you don’t know the sky
You ain’t feeling me guess you ain’t fucking with the game
If you ain’t feeling me I guess you fucking with them lames
Gave you niggas hope how the fuck you gon’ doubt me
Let you niggas in, how the fuck you gonna out me
I knew that nobody could stop me
I knew that I would make it through this point…
Yo sabía como jefe

Pablo Escobar gave me 10 bricks

Looking like I hit about 10 licks

What’s up my friend? como te llamas? my name is Jizzle

We can sit back and split up the profit minus the cost
Right now I’m on my “get money” shit , no time to floss
Man I’m talking so much money in the room I’m getting lost
And you know we do it face to face not on the selling
If you want ‘em send them shots of the sea just like on belly
And this bad bitch I got from the plug she snort the eight
Told that bitch you should be same as yourself bitch wipe your face
On the floor my columbian nigga I told ‘em Cubo
Say you ’bout to drop me a hundred I need 2 more

You could say my shit talking has matured somewhat
Still get the same point across
You know that shit you be like in the quote

Got a pantry full of bakin' soda for the whip

I'm from GA where the feds will follow ya
And the streets will swallow ya, and it's
So many bricks that you could build a mansion
With the guest house and the room for expansion
12 rooms, 8 baths, don't make me laugh
12 rounds on my hip, don't make me blast
It ain't no secret, hoes is about it
Was flippin' that soft white before I ever became famous
A few tried, but they shall remain nameless
Lunar eclipse, they tryna block my shine
Say what the fuck you want, can't stop my grind
1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 4
What the hell, maybe it's 12
So listen, lil mane, this before the rap game
Before 'em videos, before all 'em shows
Look at me now nigga, I rock my own clothes
Mold my bitches, yeah I make my own hoes

I'm from GA where the feds will follow ya
And the streets will swallow ya, and it's

Nigga please, I make money when I'm sleep
5 bricks on my lap, 100 thousand dollar nap
New Desert Eag, that's a thousand dollar strap
They say I can't rap, better smoke another blunt
I see ya when I see ya, I be in London for a month
You niggas bench riders, we know you won't play
2 shows a day even In the UK
I hear you niggas talkin', but I ain't listenin'
My neck got jealous of my wrist again
You know me, I still do it for the hood
But when them niggas came up, them niggas changed up
You know me, still the same ole G
Got the Rari in the trap, 40 ounce of Old E
62's like pancakes, the waffle house
When it comes to snowman, you better watch ya mouth
And ya back and ya front, shit's real, you better guard ya grill
Two 40 cals plus them choppas
You can call the ambulance, minus the doctors
Matter fact, nigga, hold ya breath

But the young nigga that's so cool
Its like he on the temp service, dude kept that work
You with a thottie knew want it, boy kept the purp
Ask the bottoms run through six
What they say, do kept them bricks
Just ordered me a charger, cocaine white
White paint, white rims, called the snow mobile
What else can I say, I walk like money

Big smoke clouds looking like I’m in Heaven
Came to bring the good word you can call me the reverend
When you do flaw shit then you just a flaw nigga
And if you talk like this you just a raw nigga
Mix it all up Avion and the Hennesesy
Stay prayed up because the devil is the enemy
Won't see no evil I don’t hear none either
Pussy cool credit good then she might be a keeper

But them bills keep comin so I gotta go to work
Flesh of my flesh, nigga blood of my blood

My mother used to say birds of a feather flock together if you run around with losers
You will end up a loser. It's necessary you get the losers out of your life if you want to live your dream

Win my nigga just win
It’s a dirty world but that bitch still spin
And we don’t trust the preachers or the crooked politicians
The mothafuckers always talking, they don’t ever want to listen
I’m reeking of success you can smell it thru my pores
And when I build my dream house I’m hiding money in the floors
You wanna prove em' all wrong in the end
Just win my nigga just win

Niggas grinding everyday, niggas dying everyday
Either you hustle or your starve nigga ain't no other way
Being rich, that shit's a talent being broke that’s a profession
See I woke up un-incarcerated, that shit there is a blessing
None of your mothafuckin business nigga don’t ask me why I’m stressing
Don’t know what I had to do to get it nigga don’t ask me why I’m flexing
I was born with a gift nigga I'm a bread winner
Whole team gotta eat we just we just dodging fed dinners
I just wanna win but they set me up to lose
The streets kick ya ass nigga yeah im talking judo
At the end of the day how many pussy niggas  you know
That’s what a pussy nigga do though
Im praying for a better day, I'm being optimistic
He said he want the same thing I said be more specific
Nigga it's hard out here my people sick and tired of struggling

Just win my nigga just win

Can’t wake up cause I ain't been to sleep
And the shit that I got on I been in it for a week
I see white air ones but my fingernails dirty
When you don’t see me on the block my clientele get worried
In the back of my mind, in front of my brain
I’m a pretty good shot but this ain't my aim
Want to live the American dream like Uncle Haus and his wife
Work hard, feed my kids, see what that be like
For now I’m seeing junkies and pipes
Making sure a solider put a uniform on and go and earn him some stripes
See my counselor told me education or you starve
Last time I seen her she ain't even have a job
Gangbang, sell dope or rob
Welcome to the African American mob
When you probably gone die even less than your worth
Leave your momma with the bill a funeral home and a church
Win my nigga just win
It’s a dirty world but that bitch still spin
And we don’t trust the preachers or the crooked politicians
The mothafuckers always talking, they don’t ever want to listen
I’m reeking of success you can smell it thru my pores
And when I build my dream house I’m hiding money in the floors
You wanna prove me wrong in the end
Just win my nigga just win

It's necessary to know that everybody won't see it that everybody won’t join you
That everybody won't have the vision
It's necessary to know that a lot of people want to complain. But they don’t want to do anything about there situation
That you’re an uncommon breed you know
You have to know within yourself that I can do this even if no one else sees it for me I can see it for myself that’s necessary1Embed
I been thuggin my whole fuckin' life
One look at my babygirl I had to get it right
Superman in these streets hey but you my kryptonite
Im on this drink I’m on this smoke I’m going super crip tonight
Something like a scientist, I mix it like it's antidote
Then I sent that 8 ball down the block Scrappy Loc
Rest in peace to Pookie Loc blame it on me never snitching
Lord knows I ain't send the homie on no dummy mission
Want to be like Uncle Wade can't believe I sold him crack
Still a hero in my eyes he up in heaven tell him that
Don’t tell me how to raise my son just know he gone be a man
If the scale of 1-10, know he gone be a grand
Before I stand with flaw niggas I would rather stand alone
Till I’m  stand, on the top like what he standing on
They say that I'm wishy washy ain't nobody perfect though
They say Young you growing up hope they know you worth it though

The shit I’m smoking on got me trippin' please forgive me
The shit I’m sippin' on got me trippin' will you forgive me
Look you in your eyes when I’m talking know you hear me
Just listen to the words to the song I know you feel me
Cause ain't nobody perfect in this world please forgive me
Shit I’m smoking on got me trippin' will you forgive me
Look you in your eyes when I’m talking know you hear me

'Give me Auntie Sarah when we fell out look I knew was stressful
Wasn’t for you I ride on them look we in a rival gang
Screaming fuck the other side, guess that just a rival thing
100 dollars re'ing up back then we always talked but since the fame ain't been the same
Forgive me Mrs Brenda Ross, nah not your nephew acting like a rap nigga
Like I ain’t sit on your front porch talk shit and trap with you
You asked me to help with your wedding, argument in front your kids
Hurts me to the very day, lamest shit I ever did
So please forgive me lil sister because I know I hurt your soul
Your husband is a lucky man I hope he know you worth it though

The shit I’m smoking on got me trippin' please forgive me

Soldiers march inside my mouth 
Slide down my throat, crawl inside my womb
And leave a hand grenade in my son's arms
Pre-birth occupation. 
You wait for them to grow up and  shoot us unarmed
Dear black Madonna
How many hail Mary's?
Project holy water. bless these loads we carry.  
Pregnant with potential but birthing silence. 
Tears taste like violence 
Born with  middle passage anxiety 
Why can't you feel the God in me?
A million angels follow me 
Your system don't acknowledge me. 
Born free
My prayer mat close to me
I’m my ancestor’s priority 
Which sound is closer to God's voice then children laughing? 
We the beautiful balance goddess on my block
A special kind of hell. 
Razors wrapped in feathers.  
Our bodies, wishing wells. 
We raise our daughters and pray our sons just make it home from school
We need new rules
Queens created out of red clay dust 
Pushed into classroom terrorism. Girlhood rushed. 
Our black boys born kings
You try to crucify em 
They built with steel and dreams 
Who's the criminal when the global blood is  on your hands 
We indigenous these streets been our land
You not supposed to see death this early in the morning 
If God is an American, then God must be lonely
More killed by police in our cities
Than Afghanistan  
The underestimated. Outliving our circumstance
Some of us don't dance. Some of us got plans
We don't smile for you. But our laugh is hard
Our new religion includes tearing down privatized prison bars 
Black birds fly far. I know who you are
Your bravado. you a super star. 
The science of Imhotep 
With the heart of 'Pac 
We the ones they couldn't kill.  
The chosen. We  won't stop
This is the time for hustlers and scholars  
Sunflowers and gun powder 
The lies just get louder. 
Shout out to the doubters 
She  can write surahs and psalms
In the same breath cook poems
And write dinner with her left
Rock a mic with her right
And pray her own seeds will be able to 
Exchange the heavens for a mirror 
And see themselves as the greatest reflection of GodYou might also likeEmbed

Give em the game for free, I really should have charged a fee

Black on black crime
Young men taking life, and you're putting em in your own hands
But let me give you a little game, and a little knowledge (chuckles)
You better pay close attention to this, right
The killing must stop
Y'all black mens, it's bigger than that
As soon as you get banged up, right?
You'll be down that joint, with two suit and a lock up
No green dots, no Visits
Your main bitch, you know where she be at, right?
Fucking your bottom nigga, your best nigga
So you better think
You think about what lives you're going to destroy
How many families you're gon' hurt
But guess what, you lose everything
Right before you go to sleep at night, you pray
You pray to God for a change
You gotta change

Take a sip of the Henny, then I hit the dro
Sit back in my Impala, release it slow
Remember like it was yesterday, talking all this drama
Fuck early morning arguing, just me and my mama
Tell me I need to go to school man I'm like fuck that
Left right out the house, headed, right to the trap
But it didn't stop there, it was like it was a curse
Cause as time went on, everything got worse
I started comin in the house, at all times of night
My sister lighting candles cause we ain't got no lights
I know you thinking "Damn but hold up Peep"
It's the middle of the winter, and we ain't got not heat
I knew something was wrong, ain't nobody been here my ass
Man one of y'all motherfuckers done been up in my stash
You just stood there, crazy, like "Who you talkin' to?"
Then I said them five words; "Bitch I'm talkin' to you"!
How could your own creation, talk to you that way
How could your child, talk to you that way
I swear I couldn't explain, the pain in your eyes
You just stood there silent, like you was hypnotized
Every time I think about it, it just makes me weak
How that one tear, just rolled down your cheek

Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it (I knew it nigga!)
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it (what's up?)
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

You either good or you great, you either real or you fake
That's why I stay spittin' the real because the real ones relate
Y'all must was raised by some haters, you niggas go ahead and hate
F-F-Four car garage for the 'Rari, that bitch came with the estate
I swear them streets get so tricky, glad I ain't fall for the bait
So focused and I'm determined, can see that shit in my face
You niggas go 'head and face it, lil' bitch, ain't shit 'bout me basic
Hit a lick on them bitches and went and iced out a bracelet
Never let my flaws and my past come get the best of me
Turn a two fifty to a half, I got the recipe

Running from state to state, gun in the waist for safety

A millionaire, silly 'cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy?
Y'all make this shit sound so easy
Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
'Cause that's the American Dream
Now here go the thing, listen
Hysterical screams, coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching 'em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number, they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I don't got time to explain
Out of fear that I won't reach 'em and since preaching ain't my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already

Multi-millionaire bitch I'm straight from the hood
Sucka niggas hating on me but it's all good
Lil' one just hit my phone said he want a half
Told him thirteen-five you bitches you do the math
Bought a white Corvette with the residue
Run through the hunnids towards the finish I'm counting revenue
Now when my partner walked in like "what's that?"
Let's get money my nigga time to bounce back

Real niggas get the cash in a major way
Lotta horses and it's fast in a major way
Bought the iced out Rollie in a major way
All bright looking holy in a major way
Boss nigga boss shit in a major way
Flaunt nigga, floss shit in a major way
Still do it for my town in a major way
Move that white and that brown in a major way

Real niggas getting real shit
And if you 'bout that floss shit, get loked bitch
Just know that I was hands on, I paid dues
Took 'em 'side that 75, I made moves
You know who I am boy? The living legend
Ever since I hit the boulevard in that 911
You ain't got to take my word, you can ask Lil Zay
Fit the family with them birds you can ask Lil Jay
Niggas talking like they big, but guess who's bigger
Niggas talking like they real, but guess who's realer
Fuck the hating motherfuckers see I came up out the gutter
And I've been on my grind since I came out my mother
Bad bitch on my line I told her she gotta wait

Pockets full of cash off my latest play
I've been getting money like I'm touring heavy state to state
Used to chop every last gram until I scrape the plate
Four niggas looking like we signed to major labels
Dining at Katanas twelve phones on the table
Buncha horses parked outside, the lot a stable
If you know us then you know this shit is not a fable
What you see is diamond chains on everybody's neck, everybody flexing
Hit the club and everybody sweat and everybody's stressed
Niggas talking big shit boy go do better

Yeah, what's up?
All my real niggas with me, sing
20/20 hindsight, you gotta just do today, you know?
Caught up in the grind
Do you hear me? That's great

Oh, sometimes I don't know where I'm turning to
Sometimes I don't know, you know?
I look in the mirror
Look in that mirror
And I see the truth
All my real niggas with me, sing
But the truth is, I don't know what to do now
All my real niggas with me, sing
I'm so lost without you

Truth is, yeah, I wish I was better (Swear to God)
I was chasing the cheddar (Yeah)
I ain't take the time to write you a letter
I was too busy chasing the funds
I ain't take the time out to take a day and just be your son
Middle school, yeah, I got me a pack
Yeah, I got me a sack
Daddy gone, so I pick up the slack
Lord knows that you need a new couch
And if I had it my way right now, I'd buy you a house
If you gon' stay here, be watching your mouth
Then what I do?
Turn around and hid them eight balls all in your house (Damn)
Safe to say I was breaking the rules
I was posted on Poplar Street, pocket full of rocks and a tool
No secret, I was failing the school
Had you crying so much late night that you could fill up a pool
What's Heaven when you're living in Hell?
DA hoping I fail, so they can lock me up and give me a cell (Hey)

Just know that you raised you a king, I might live all my dreams (Believe that)

And last, my mom
I don't think you know what you did
You had my brother when you were 18 years old
Three years later, I came out
The odds were stacked against us
One of the best memories I had was when we moved into our, our first apartment
No bed, no furniture, and we just all sat in the living room and just hugged each other
'Cause we, that's what we, we thought we made it
When something good happens to you, I don't know about you guys, but I tend to look back to what brought me here
You made us believe, you kept us off the street
Put clothes on our backs, food on the table
You went to sleep hungry, you sacrificed for us
You the real MVP
I look in the mirror, I see the truth
But the truth is, I don't know what to do now
I'm so lost without you1Embed

Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?
I was in the streets the other day, I had a homie come through and he ask me
Say "Yo! Everybody listen to you, everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?"
I told him "Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty"
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go

I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy
From the city where them young niggas die skinny
Keep work on deck if you need any
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me!
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready
Feels like I was born for this
If not, at least I'll die for it
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it
The big question is what can I do for the youth?
Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth

"I'm a hustler!" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
Real or fake y'all, we gon' see tonight
And I think I know the way, follow me
"I got hustle!" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night

Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional
Same picture, see it one of three ways
Let it marinate, it might take a few days
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence
So I shouldn't say nothin? Get a moment of silence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense
Words to live by, took it out of context
They say your past is your present and your present is your cash
So I look forward to the future

Street smart, with a little book sense
A young nigga with a lot of common sense
They say I'm shallow, but I think so deep (how deep?, how deep?)
Deep as the abyss

Half a mill in the basement, god damn I'm flagrant
I want it all, no matter the cost
Fuck the consequences, ain't nothing to a boss
Made a lot out of a little, something out of nothing
I'm so proud of me
With the streets on top, where they supposed to be
The sky is the limit, that's what Jeezy said
And the limit is the sky

Welcome to the life of a young thug nigga (yea)
Only hang out wit' them criminals and drug dealers (ayyy)
I'm from even where dead die (die)
But try an' do it big like the kid from Bedstuy

I got a carbon 15 and I'm fully prepared (that's right)
Lord a mercy 20 rounds in a clip (yea)
Outta line get 20 rounds in ya hip (ayyy)
Shoot first and ask questions later (lata)
The answer is it was all about the paper (yea)
Everything to gain and shit to lose
And a new forty-five that I'm dyin' to use (yeahhhh)

If ya real like me (like me)
Throw ya hoods in the air so the whole wide world can see (ay)
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
And if ya real like me (like me)
Keep that thang on ya hip that's just the way that it's gotta be
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed

I done seen niggas come and go
Shit the whole world done seen what I done before
We do anything when the funds is low
I'm the reason outta towners don't come no mo'
Let me show you niggas how to break down the whole thang
My nigga B.G. know Buck been a birdman
It's got to be in ya blood to be a thug
If I ain't makin' enough I'mma jack my plug
We was born in it, not sworn in it
You can go against it or you can join wit' it

Some of the dudes we thought was real O.G.'s was O.B's
Cause they talked pleas and included G's like you and me
The first step was going to set a trap
So in a short period, they convinced the grand jury to allow a phone tap
And if they listenin'
Not once did they hear us mentioning
Murder and a cocaine distributing
Through all that was dividends comin' in
I'm strict legit, and better yet we too smart for ya bullshit
Callin all cars (callin all cars)
Hit your burglar alarm
And tell 'em hurry up and come them niggas got gunz
Man down, shots fired, only fuck niggas and cops died
First stage of a riot
And them fucks couldn't sneak by
Oh you want to witness some shit
Fine bitch, be quiet
Because they only got what you tell 'em
And only witness that they had, the bitch was layin' there dead
Shot in the street all red, with two shots to his head
Cause he was workin' for the feds
And the last informant, informed us
They had it out for us
For a bird that he got popped for
So ride or die for him (ride or die for him)
Better yet, you better kill 'em
Cause I think he's gonna be the bitch to tell 'em
And he probably done already told 'em
But then again with out a witness them bitches ain't got shit
If ya real like me (like me)
Throw ya hoods in the air so the whole wide world can see (ay)

And every time I do it I do it for they hood
It's understood I do it for the hood

The streets love Jeezy and I love 'em back
If I still had work I'd front ya a sack
It's all gravy still reaching wit my words
And make 'em feel good like the first and the third
Take you back when I was sixteen wit a bankroll
Posted on a corner like a light pole
They used to call us track stars
Before they even stopped we ran to dem cars
And everybody on the block got the same agenda
Hustle from the beginning of January til the end of December
Wasn't smokin purple then it was more like bobby brown
On that hen dog straight got a nigga drinking brown (7/11 nigga you know)
You know 10 to 4 shake 'em up talk shit get my drink and let 'em go
Even when I'm on the road the gangstas stay in touch
Why the fuck you think they love me so much? (Ha ha!)


I'm talking bout summertime cookouts and wintertime flights
It ain't nothing we hearing shots all night
Ford Taurus pulls up everybody run
White boys jump out pointing wit they guns (5-0, 5-0)
Ford Taurus leave everybody came back
Hope dem boyz didn't find my sack
Real recognize real I suppose
I guess that's why the gangstas be at all my shows
Got the deal nothing changed but my clothes
Still catch me in the 'jects fuckin wit them hoes (projects!)
Like coo-coo cal
Lord I wish mad Lou could see me now
Wish Gold Mouth was home, Mel Man was free
A lot of niggas crossing over dog no not me
Closest I ever been to commercial when I watch TV
And everybody know I rep these streets faithfully

How the fuck I'm free out here and you locked in there
Your whole family acts like I don't care
They don't know about the nights I just lay in my bed
I can't even sleep, I just lay in my bed
Eyes full of tears and a heart full of pain
Take deep breaths everytime I hear your name
You was more than family you was like my brother
So when the shit went down it's like I lost my brother
And I wish we could trade places
Swear to God dawg wish we could trade places
Livin' a life of crime, but it wasn't your life it was more like mine
I often think about the close calls we had
And I often think about the close brawls we had
And I love my nigga, what you know bout that

Knew I was a gangsta I wasn't going for that
Pussy nigga in my yard, talkin' shit
Knowin' damn well I was on some G shit
Let the whole clip ride and didn't think
Let the whole clip ride and didn't blink
You asked me kindly don't bring the white in the house
And then what I do, bring the white in the house
Bricks in the attic and you ain't know
Your grandsons a killer, he getting 24
Feds at the door, I'm out of town
You ain't tell em shit, you held me down
Now a-days I rock the mic I'm getting paid for that
And all the shit I been through I'm getting paid for that
Always said I would make it, wish you could see me now
But if I tried to tell her, she probably wouldn't believe me now

Never let 'em play me, never let 'em bullshit me
If they ever bullshit me, send the coroner to get me
And when the coroner come get me, I'mma take you pussies with me
I ain't trustin' 12 shots, you know I keep them choppers with me
And I don't trust you Bumba clots, you know I keep them shotta's with me
Can't let the goons get bored, gotta keep them niggas busy

To get everything straight
Now I'm sittin here like how much Gatorade make
How much money would it take
To make some mo money
Damn right a nigga straight
Come get some mo' from me
I sold millions
Made them millions
But still y'all doubt me

Can't be that bad
Still got my trap swag
And everytime I do a show
I leave with a trap bag
Money in trash bags

If you can't find Chaka
Then my right hand's Kinky
Look, I am simply
One of the best
Can't even lie
I can't vouch for the the rest
Just like Ziploc
Made a killin' in plastic
Best add five grams
That's if you weigh it in plastic
I am so dope
Need to wrap me in plastic
When they wrap me in plastic
Need to put me in traffic
They say that I'm difficult
Even different
Show me the difference
I'll bring you the difference
Let's talk about hate, cause I get allot of that

Hey, Young. When you first started this shit, it was for your hood. It was for your block. Now, the world is your hood, my nigga. We got more shit to straighten out; more people to motivate; more people to talk to; more people that's gon' listen. Damn, my nigga, you still here? They-a thought you'd've fell off by now. Guess it's true what they say, huh? They hate you when you smarter. But this is Trap Or Die 2. Don Cannon! The return of the Snowman! Come on, my nigga, what's better than that? I'm asking you (Let's go!)

Fell off? I'm bout to pick up where I left off
Like when cuz' used to front up that whip, got it the hell off
Took that bullshit to the block and went the hell off
It even left a scent in my jeans—can't get the smell off
And to move this, you got to be quick 'cause it'll melt off
And you stuck with eggnog in the bag, and it won't sell off
Sell off? Yeah, I doubt that it will sell off
Every nigga you sell it to will call you 'til you turn your cell off
And every day I'm stuck in this hell, can't get the hell off
Back then, they wasn't wishing me well, wanted me well off
Niggas trying steal all my clients, turn my till off
Won't be happy til I put up my bags and turn my scale off
So I'm grinding til your battery's low and your scale off
So I guess I'm stuck flipping these words until I'm well-off
That money's like a movie, just something you gotta see
You just can't say you're real, it's something you gotta be

103, nigga!
Yeah
103, nigga!

To it from another dream
I sat up alone in my palace
Drenched in both sweat
My blood shut eyes were exposed by the sun raze
And being that I was alone
I was all exposed to myself
The silence that was going in my head
As I stepped out on the city
Chico there was a time when nobody believed in me
I always knew to look above it
And now, I'm looking above them
I want them to know about the struggle
The hussle
And what to they know about adversities anyways
Ye, I come from the slums, but so what?
I could repeat it to you a hundred times if I want
I could write it in a letter
But nothing will let you know I'm Jefe
More than my cold silence

I can't help that we're the greatest

What's in the back of my mind, sittin' in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all
Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yea, I'm talkin' to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em

Fuck everybody in this world as long as we have each other

Gotta find a new game to conquer, I'm thinking rap

Put them diamonds in my name and my chain, I gotta shine
Stunting everything'll real when we do break bread with 'em
Swear it ain't been the same since the day the FEDs hit 'em

Pretty soft way, steady mobbin be the gang
Cut the music down cause my cellphone ringing
From what I just heard think my cellphone dreaming
Wasn't doing this I'd probably be a politician
Fuck first forty-eight just too much snitching
If them folks get behind me it be a whole lot of chasing
Cause I ain't pulling over be a whole lotta arresting

Ain't a damn thing change now

Black cars jeweled up with the big-faced hundreds

And just when I thought it couldn't get no better
Nigga hit me on my chirp, got all my cheddar

Big bag full of white, you woulda thought it was some flour
Going hard in the kitchen like a culinary school
I be doin my thang, I'm a culinary fool
So much PJ, I was pissin that shit
Talkin bottles so big put a fist in that shit
You were born that way, always be a hater
Don Juan on these hoes, always be a playa
Way I work through the check I shoulda been a calculator
I'm so cold with this shit, count it in the refrigerator
Jewelry store, green bob bought my first Cartier
Threw em 30 thou and got the fuck up outta there
That's how JoJo and Timbo one day got indicted
If it's a party with the feds, I ain't tryna get invited

Rose gold Jacob, 4 units for the timepiece
Got my niggas working so much they need a time sheet
They thought it was a joke until I copped that 6

Ever see a nigga pop a hundred bottles for the club
Wanna be a trap man, get the money, get ya love
One song, blew a quarter chicken, yeah that's a condo
If a nigga re'ing up with half a ticket that's a car quote

Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it
I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it
This should be addition, these niggas subtractin'
And why I'm so tense, man, i should be relaxin'
Remember times on the highway with them ten
Done it all the best, cuz ive never seen the pen
Still do it for the streets cause they taught that boy a lesson
You done it how i did it, man, they call that shit perfection

I'm from a small hood, but I had big dreams
My uncle Robert taught me how to use the big beam
That was right before he caught his life sentences
Do what you gotta, just put your life in it, (hey)
Me and Goldmouth in this jeep, we on the road
All I saw was red and blue lights, I thought he told
Butterflies as we going through this roadblock
Ask yourself questions like (is this where my road stop?)
I'm tryna be cool, this nigga nervous
He sweatin' like a two dollar whore in Sunday Service
Got at least two blocks of hard back in this bitch
Right now I'm thinkin' we should've better packaged this shit
God works in mysterious ways and yes He do
Said "Mister that's a nice Cherokee" and they let us through
So, don't get to talkin' these records, I sold millions
3.5 off in Magic, I bought billions!

I'm the king of the kitchen nigga this is my stove
That's why I got my own lane, bitch I made my own road (That's right!)
Now I'm movin' weight like a trainer and a diet
Used to put the work in a bag and then I tie it
Flashbacks I can't deny, but you tell them police ass niggas "Bitch I'm retired"
That's why I do it for the ones in the street, ones in the cage
All the shit I'm goin' through, I should be askin' for a raise

I hope my words they insipre ya, spoke like a true leader
The first to admit life's more than two seaters
Man oh man how my priorities fucked up
Remember nights I'm passin' out in the Rari, too fucked up
My niggas say spend it cause you can't take it witcha'
Same time poppin' Cristal, posing for pictures
Ol' smart ass nigga, half right and half wrong
Only problem is he still here and the money gone
Oh me, oh my, give me a natural high
When I think about the nights we threw them Rollies in the sky
When I was so mother fuckin' clean on 'em, need a tie
Every hater in the club was just wishin' we would die
A hustlers life is filled with decisions he gotta make
Remeber when I got the news I was ready to cry a lake
Swear my levy was 'bout to break, lost religion and all my faith
I swear I seen the same shit happen to Shake
Can you imagine that look I had on my face?
Saw my nigga layin' still in a box what a waste
Got me feelin' sick, feeling like I'm 'bout to vomit
I guess a loss ain't shit if you don't learn nothin' from it
Got me pacin' round the room, yeah NASCAR nigga
See my nigga sittin' there to drive a fast car nigga
I'm like "Why you ridin' that? Them boys is mysteries nigga"
Live real or die tryin' is still a victory niggaYou might also like1Embed

Soda sit the jacket, she smoke the shit out of cans
Saying Young you just might have you a business, you Need A Plan
Gave my lil' nigga some money, "Go buy some pots"
"Take my rental and don't fuck around, the stove is hot"
Nigga why should I be playin' with your hair, the stove or not
Fuck you mean I ain't answerin' my phone? Your numbers blocked
If the folks hit the door right now, my heart would stop
We in this bitch playin' possum right now, me and the blocks
Got a nigga rollin' a spliff right now, he round the block
'Bout to play Bruce Lee on these bitches, karate chop

I hope my hustle don't offend nobody
I can give a fuck what you think about me
You know I like to turn up at the spot
Act a fool with the money
G told me keep it low-key

And errythin', coulda smoke a thousand Newports
Really no difference between money and the time
Thin line do it all cause I can't be broke

Back when they was goin' for the two fo', had it sowed up
They pulled me with this nina  in this strap it be a felony
If I get through with this nina on my lap, I'm livin' heavenly
Speed ballin' like this shit a sprint, but this a marathon
Phone ringin' all day and night, like a telethon
If you a real hustler you gon' get that, he ain't get it
If you a real hustler you know how to stay committed

When these streets is all you know (All you know, baby)
It's hard to tell whose a friend or a foe (No question)
All I need is a beautiful girl (Yeah, wassup)
So me and her, can fuck the world
Middle finger with her legs in the air
Getting money so it's hard to care (It's hard to care, baby)
All I need is a beautiful girl
So me and her, can fuck the world

She like Avion on ice, a lil' Belvee
And once we get together ain't nothin' you can tell me
One thing about my G, she might just bring a friend
And when the night started, sometimes it never end
I said she grown, just the way I like that
And she open minded, just the way I like that
I like the way she touch me, she do it so mature
Bet I can make her lust me, I'm a hundred percent sure
And even from the start, she seemed so hesitant
We here now, long time coming that was evident
She want me I want her, think that's an attraction
Yeah she 'bout that life though, baby 'bout that action, that's what I told her

I tell her that I need her, she don't believe that
I miss her when she go like "Where my G at?"
In a league of her own, she a bad one
Never felt like this, you never had one
She bad, I'm fly, we high
And the shit we on, nigga, fo' life 'til we die
'Til we die, came from the bottom just aim for the sky

Hit her on the late night, tell her that I'm 'bout to fall through
Said it's been waitin' on you nigga, get us all you
She got a little paper, might just tell her "Let me hold some"
I said I'm on my way, you just go ahead and roll one
She said just come through, and I'mma roll a few
And make it stand tall, then I'mma roll on you

One thing about it, we gon' get this bread
When you knew shit was real? When they found a rat dead
Right around the corner where us young niggas hustled at
Right by the stop sign, that's where they was bussin' at
When you come here with nothin', gotta learn how to provide
Carlo had a Benz 'fore he was old enough to drive
Losin' 10-20 every night, gamblin' ain't nothin'
Nigga got killed takin' up for his cousins

Oh Lord, I woke up this morning and started praying
And only niggas feeling my pain, know what I'm saying
Dear Lord, street life ain't no game, know what I'm saying
It's for my money really, fuck the fame and I ain't playing
See I passed the rock a couple of times, let me assist
Nigga me and ya'll together how the fuck we gonna miss
Nigga all we worry about is how the fuck they gonna flip
Cut the window drop things, I swear to god they gonna trip
Meet the haters meet the feds, now that's gotta be a sign
Smoked a blunt and laughed about it, writing lose my mind
Hit the booth and spazzed out, almost lost my mothafuckin' mind
Bought a mic for these hoes, you know my mothafuckin' grind
Sleep is the cousin of death, and I'm alive
Thug Motivation plus inspiration equals survive
They tryna rob me of this success with no disguise
I know that shit was hard on you Young

(If you grind hard enough)
You can stack a few mil' nigga make it out the streets like me
(If you grind strong enough)
You can be a trap star nigga be on TV and keep it G

You can take care of your nephews and your nieces and your moms and your girl

In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good seems to let evil occur
While still possessed in our human form we live life searching for greatness
Since the day we were born
And as we bow our heads at night
Rich, wealthy, or poor with dislikes
We pray asking for forgiveness for our sinful ways
With Mind, Body, Spirit, and Faith we Pray AMEN
Yea(Amen) You like that right(Amen) I wrote it myself by the way(Amen)
Yo Young(Amen) Jeezy Jizzle Snowman
We gotta give the streets what they want man
FUCK THE GOT DAMN SHIT
You gotta get it in
Lets get it

Bow our heads let us pray
Thanks to the day
Bills paid crib laid thanks to the Yay
In that 'Rari at that red light that's in the 'A
Glock 40 with that red light that's anyway
See you mothafuckas actin' like yall done caught amnesia
I know what to do get them chains up out the freezer
Bitch it's Mr. Trap or Die ok you niggas asked for it
Yall know these niggas couldn't walk a mile in my air jordans

Countin' 20's in my white beater way 2 many nights

See you doing big shit and niggas get petty (Petty)
Don’t try to get me, nigga, get fetti
Been a motherfucking minute, how you niggas been?
We got a lot to talk about, where should we begin?
Can’t trust these niggas ‘cause they unholy (Holy)
It’s every man for hisself, that’s what the streets showed me
And I demand my respect, that’s what the streets owe me
And I don’t speak on street cred ‘cause it speak for me
I watched niggas do some shit I couldn’t understand (‘Stand)
You know I stay prepared for it, didn’t under-plan (Nah), yeah
What he thinking? Got him wondering
Meanwhile, I’m working wonders, I’m the Wonder-Man
I woke up feeling all Trap Or Die 2-ish (2-ish)
Still counting old money, think I’m half-Jewish
And if you thought that I was over then you half-foolish
That nigga Young, he gets it done, these niggas half-do this, yeah! (Yeah)
I tell them, “Who better?” (Who better?)
Don’t get it fucked up, nigga, not ever (Ever)
It’s the nigga that you love to hate, they call him “Young”
The big homie sat me down when I was young—he said:
“I hope that you ready, ‘cause you the one” (One)
So I listened to him, stayed down, and bought me one (One)
I took a trip to the Greenbriar Mall and bought me some (Some)
I learned me a valuable lesson, it taught me something (What’s that?)
If you believe, you shall achieve (‘Chieve)
That street money’ll buy you some shit you wouldn’t believe (Yeah)
All types of homes and watches, luxury cars (Cars)
Why the hell y’all think I be spitting luxury bars? (Yeahhh)
Let me ask you a question: Do you believe? (‘Lieve)
‘Cause right now, it’s Young and them—who you believe?
Take a trip with me down Memory Ave. (Ave.)
Seven O’s, nines, and splits, and fifty slabs (Damn)
Flood the streets, typhoon-style, ’til it’s a drought
It’ll turn you to a marketing genius, a Steve Stoute (Yeah)
Told him, “500 a piece, bring me a gram” (Gram)
Nigga think I’m showing him love, I’m building my brand (Haha!)
Why the hell you think I sold all them nines? ‘Cause I’m a leader (Leader)
Came from the jungle, more stripes than a fucking zebra (Zebra)
Born on the day of the ounce, the 28th (Eighth)
Nigga sign was a scale, we knew we would sell weight (Young!)
Type of nigga know I’m the shit, I feel stank (Stank)
And right now, I’m feeling myself, I feel faint (Yeah)
Chances of making it out, they ain’t great
You want to hear it from somebody that done it? I feel great
Do it for the times I was stressed, I lost weights (Weight)
Patrolling, accepting my past, I lost eight (Damn)

Broke hoes hate man, broke hoes in it
Stay away from fake shit, fake shit ain't in me

Better get there early, might be late for the show
Now niggas change cause ain't been through in awhile

Y'all niggas don't really want it with 'cool J'
I guess it's me against the world, God damn, what can I say?
I put them little boys on my lap, I birthed niggas
How you think they got on the map? I earthed niggas
Keep buying bullshit chains, should pay some homage
Sell your music from the side of the road, the shit is garbage
Look at Young, came right back applying pressure
Just know that I'mma die by mine, might need a stretcher (Look)
Look at me, I'm back on my shit, nothing can touch me
I can buy a hundred sixteen bricks, move to Kentucky
Might buy a big house on the hill, might buy a farm

Copped that candy-cane Lam' on they ass, who's capping now?
Man these muh'fuckas hating to hate, that's what I hate
Look them deep down way in their soul, they know I'm great
Muthafuckas acting like I ain't did it, like I ain't done it
The Michael Jackson of my lane, and bitch I run it
And I can see the finish line from here, I might sprint
Remember nothing inside my pockets but white lint
I should charge you mothafuckas to roam, just like Sprint
I'm used to bussin' licks all on my phone, behind tint
I'm from where niggas pull them home invasions behind rent
From where them folks have them dogs in the cars behind tints
From where them best friend shoot up they friends behind cash
Best friends shoot up they Benz behind ass
And I was the one keeping it real, when they was faking
And I was the one to serve you a deal, when they was baking
Can paint a picture using my words, look like they posing
You know my chains like to dance in the light, look like they voguing
Used to risk my life, that's everyday, that trap life
Think these muh'fuckas mad cause I know what that trap likes
Y'all got these mothafuckas thinking they street, they really sidewalk
Nigga don't say what they mean, they really side talk
Fresh Air Max, a hundred miles, and running
I do it for them niggas, a hundred pounds and coming
And damn right that boy ain't playing, he right back
Know how to say right shit on the right track
And everybody ordering beef, I had a steak
Serve me two to the head, my momma' gon' cry a lake
Till my casket drop I'm chasing this cash, when will it stop?
Bet my bitch went to bed masturbating, listening to Pac
They love me when I was here, but when will they mourn me?
Ten deep on the side of the road, in that Californy

They like, "Young where you been?" Niggas acting like I got ghost
Til' I came back in that black on black Phantom ghost
Looking better the Picasso y'all should frame me
Killing niggas Kunta Kinte y'all should hang me

Rap game fucked up but you can't blame me
Seen 'em come seen 'em go you know how the game be
Snowman's back, Young you too wild
Had to switch it up man niggas tryn' steal the style

Anyway any how the steering wheel black and mild
Make the broad back that ass up think I'm Juvenile
My leather too soft just like Wayne and Baby Nem
Teacher ask me what I wanna be told that bitch a ATM
Dream was to turn my whole block into a CVS
Can't trust them broads around the way, them bitches devious
Drop it in watch it make it circle like a DVD
62 and 125 half a quarter key

Fuck these haters, I’d kill them all if I could
Ain't scared of none of y’all, so you know my aim good
Blowing bin Laden in my Porsche 911
Just left Ground Zero, on my way to kush heaven
Can’t slow down, too much evil in my rearview
Sometimes you wanna scream to God, but he can’t hear you
And even if you did, this’ll probably be his answer:
"Fuck you ‘plaining about? It ain’t like you got cancer"
Do it for my niggas on the block that got it worse
First the love, then the hate, that just a trap nigga’s curse
I bet you feel like the whole world hating on you
But what’s the hold up? The whole world waiting on you

(The fame…)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you want to squeeze your Glock until it’s empty
I’m already standing on the edge, so don’t tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy

You mean to tell me from running my big mouth
That I could chill here in this big penthouse?
All elevatored up, black hardwood floors
Just to sit around and feel like it ain’t yours
Your conscience got you feeling like you done something wrong
But the flatscreen saying motherfucker, we on
Pardon me, nigga, do you see this view?
See Ruth’s Chris from here, what the fuck’s wrong with you?
Looking at my Rollie, yeah, it’s almost 7
Bill Gates state of mind with an automatic weapon
You might remember from putting on for the city
Or back when it was on 2, going for the 50
Opened up a few squares, opened up a few tours
Just to show niggas keys open up doors
“Oh, we don’t fuck with Young no more” Why not?

Don’t worry ’bout me, God got me, bruh, I’m doin’ fine
Another year in prison, promise this is it for me
Tryna make it through the storm, should be makin’ history
No feelin’ sorry for me, keep ya pity and ya sympathy
Good or bad, take it like a man, whatever meant for me
How I did it make ‘em hate my spirit, they wish they could kill it
And they’ll take it however they can get it
Wanna see me fulla misery, walkin’ wit’ my head down
“Let’s decapitate him, then we’ll see if he can wear his crown”

Fuck you, fuck you
I'm back, Mr. Magic City
Blowin' color purple, I make it rain on your forehead
You woulda thought I had a fan the way I blow that money
You woulda thought I had a plan the way I throw that money
The Feds outside and they checkin' his tag
But still the boy move with a hell of a swag
It's like the soundtrack to my life
Everyday I'm under investigation
But I will not stop so you can stop the hating
What more can I say? It's like my gift and my curse
To fail or succeed, I don't know whats worse
I don't know what's worse
Agents tryna find a glitch in my matrix
One slip and I'm back to the basics
Red or blue pill, what would you do?
When the same niggas you love got hate in their blood
I know god's watching over me, so is the Fed's
When love turns to hate and niggas rather you dead
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
All the bad I've done, will you still protect my life?

I got some child support for you
Get off your ass bitch and get you a job

My son got everything in the world that I never had
One thing you can't call me is a deadbeat dad
When you're the one that shoulda been exposed
Unfit mother still playin' witcha nose
And I don't wanna tell my child
That his moms ain't shit
And this ain't about him
She just a money hungry bitch
I been here before
They boxed me in a corner and I came out fighting
They locked me in a cell and I came out writing
I said I came out writin'
Lock my body, you can't trap my mind
I only talk in the bedroom, we whisper in the kitchen
Call me paranoid, I think the walls is listening
But if them walls could talk
I'd prolly never get to see the daylight
I gave it to 'em raw, mixtape after mixtape
I had niggas waiting on the album
I shoulda got five mic's in the Source
Instead I got five bricks and a Porsche
They say I ain't lyrical
I wasn't tryna impress y'all niggas
If hating was a crime, they'd arrest ya niggas
Kink bought the mic, I just gave him my life
The streets co-signed, the hood gave me my stripes
I said, the streets co-signed, the hood gave me my stripes
Kink bought the mic, I just gave him my life
I said, the streets co-signed, the hood gave me my stripes
Yeah, I know you ain't done 'em
I'm back, better than before, matter fact, I'm better than ever
They can't box me in, that boy too clever
So CNN worried 'bout little ol' me
Fuck the bitch ass reporter who wrote the story
You motherfuckers don't know shit about me
What I been through or where I came from
When shit got hard, I stayed, I ain't run
So you can blame the government, they made me this way
See the pain in my eyes, you don't see me cry
Two tears in a bucket, who got that work?
Real talk, I'll make us a way
Get rich, or I'mma go to jail tryin'
Uncle Sam ain't never gave me shit
But my partner out west, yeah he front me them bricks
How the hell you expect me to be drug free?
When George Bush ain't never done shit for me
Follow me home and tap my phone
What happened to my freedom of speech?
Love don't love nobody
Got me feelin' like I shouldn't love myself
I practice what I preach, I preach what I practice
A hundred thou under my mattress
I'm only human, just a man
God gave me a gift to do the best that I can
Critics say I can't make an album better than my first one
The way I feel, that'll prolly be my worst one
Another one after that will be better than my last
So real talk, y'all can kiss my ass
This is the beginning of the beginning
I am the future
You niggas are a thing of the past
I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've become
So all you ridicule lookin' I'm not the one
It's called self respect, I bow down to no man
I say all that to say that you can't ban the snowman1Embed

Take the heaters out on you hoe cakes
Niggas took a stand on that dope case
Got murked out chillin' at a bird house
Shoulda seen the look on that ho face
When we kicked the doors off the hinge
Niggas that don’t really go all out to win
Six feet deep when you catch a nigga sleep in the streets
Man I bet he won't doze off again
Niggas took a Chevy and blowed off the lid
Show a hundred pounds and balled off the bitch
A couple hundred shots will hold off the pigs
'Til my homeboy Will get home off his bid
I'mma still do stickups
Two Mossberg pumps in the pickup
Everybody keep your cool cause if anybody move
The bust shots will tear your whole clique up
Niggas get rushed out the ambulance lift up, lift off
Face in his ribcage, ripped off
Niggas tax 30 badges for the 36

I said now what it is, what it do? Home girl ain't got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side, yeah, and ask you who's ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I musta had too much to drink I'm in my G-mode
So all the ladies repeat after me 'cause it's the G-code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me it’s gon' be the bomb

So la-a-dy, after the "I Do's" let's do Mercedes
Let's tie the knot, let's grab us a pot, let's make a baby
Looking back, I don't know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And until the task force roll
To hug her every corner 'til I get ash from the cold
Or until I've amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever (Ever), ever (Ever)
Your secrets I treasure, for better or worser

Baby I'm hell (Yeah), save me, don't bail (No, no)
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like, like-like love and
"Friend", "rock star" and "so and so's a genius"
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooh, momma's sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit ain't gon' fall too far from tree
So if we ever woopty woop, I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Let's put a baby butterfly up in your lil' cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby, she'll be nerdy make the whole club swoon
She'll love books and cook and look just like you
And when she's done being young, she'll dress like you
We'll call her Love 22, she'll tote a 22, the laser version13Embed

And when we hit up the club, you know them broads coming through
I told her hit up her girl, tell them that they can come too
And now that bitch off the chain, I told y'all then what I do

Bitches they screaming, I can hear bitches calling
Give a fuck if they like it, tell them niggas I'm balling
These niggas holding they nuts

Swear these niggas a trip

They want me trip on my strings
Want me fall on my face
Hit a lick for a hundred and it fell in my safe
Said she no alcoholic, but she drink like a toilet
Told her do me a favor and put your mouth on this faucet
I know just how she like it
She might think I'm a psychic
Even called me a plumber, she like the way that I pipe it
Niggas talk like they know me, they must got me mistaken

I got em bouncing and leaning, I got em drinking and smoking
I told her take off her clothes
What she say? That she open

You know I'm dead-ass serious. Why? Cause I said it twice

Must be drinking amnesia, cause I forgot what I said
Stack up so much bread I'mma need me a toaster

Keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right
While I’m out here focused, getting this bread right
But if the head right, Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain’t gone
All I ask, let me just do me

12 years old, caught up in that street life

Ran the streets tongue-tied, couldn't sleep nights
Cause when you're living wrong, it's hard to sleep right
But it is what it is, gotta eat, right?
Cop them things they be whiter than your teeth, right?
Dreamed some big things on my grandmama couch
Hid some big things at my grandmama house

(J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League) Yeah
Therapy baby, for my soul
Yeah, just tryna heal, you know?
Yeah

Been listenin' to my thoughts and lately I've been concerned
Feel like my soul on fire, let that motherfucker burn
Man, nobody gave me shit, I wait my motherfuckin' turn (Turn)
Therapy for my soul
I had a few hits, even had a few misses
Got clumsy in the kitchen, even broke a few dishes
Street life scarred me, my soul need therapy (Therapy)
Therapy for my soul

I ain't never been the one to complain, that's win or lose
Made moves and paid dues, walk in my shoes
It's like a nigga came with directions, I really made me
I was drownin' then I threw me a float, I really saved me
Put down everything that I love, that's on my legacy
Never fucked over nobody to make a better me
If you ask me what happened with Kink, we grew apart
Tried to sue, he took me to court, shit broke my heart
Same nigga you made a millionaire sue you for millions
Made man and he want it all, none for my children
If 1-5 wasn't my dawg, I would've touched them
When that shit went down with Gibbs, I couldn't trust him
Invested my hard earned money, tied up my bread
But he gon' try to tell you I'm flawed, that's in his head
It's happening just the way that I said it, good on your own
And if I'm honest, nothin' gangsta about you, leave this alone, yeah
And everybody wonderin' what happened with me and Coach
Same shit that happened between Tommy and Ghost
'Cause, yeah, the checks comin' in but the trust ain't there
I would say it's all him but that wouldn't be fair
I was fresh up out the streets, tryna fight my own demons
Knew somethin' wasn't right, guess I had my own reasons
Mission impossible, I ain't underplan that
Shake took his own life, I ain't understand that
Had me feelin' numb, laid in bed for a week
Eyes didn't close one time, that's a week with no sleep
I'ma keep it solid, he the reason me and Ross talk
Never ashamed to admit that I was wrong, yeah, that's boss talk
Since we talkin' boss talk, let's address the sucka shit
Grown man playin' on Instagram, real sucka shit
Why the fuck this clown nigga playin' with my legacy?
Solid in these streets, that's some shit that you will never be
Talking 'bout power, but weak niggas do the most
In real life, nigga you really borrow money from Ghost
All that lil' boy shit, yeah, it make it evident
Made millions in these streets, what the fuck is 50 Cent?
And it's still free Meech, love him if he right or wrong
But the streets wanna know, do we really get along?
If you askin' me, nigga, that's one thousand percent
If I did somethin' wrong then I gotta repent
Ain't no hatred in my heart, ain't no hatred in my veins
If you felt me being distant, think it's time to explain
I was stickin' to my plan while Raf Simons took the stand
He tried to G-Money me, what's happenin' with your man?
Tried to throw me in your case, guess he tryna save face
No exception, know the rules, I just handled it with grace
And I ain't sayin' that you told him to do it, I know better
Still the same nigga, nothin' but love, that's forever
See my ego and my pride, yeah, I put it all aside
Reminiscing 'bout all them late nights we used to vibe
When it's all said and done, we're brothers, your mother love us
The Feds did you dirty, can't stand them motherfuckers
Speaking 'bout brothers, welcome home, Tee
A nigga might owe you money, but that nigga ain't me
I be lookin' for the truth 'cause that shit be hard to find
All these lies and these rumors fuckin' with my peace of mind

My son got everything in this world that I never had
One thing you can't call me is a deadbeat dad
When you're the one that shoulda been exposed
Unfit mother still playin' withcha nose
And I don't wanna tell my child
That his moms ain't shit
And this ain't about him
She just a money hungry bitch
I been here before
They boxed me in corner and I came out fighting
They locked me in a cell and I came out writing
I said I came out writin'
Lock my body you can't trap my mind
I only talk in the bedroom, we whisper in the kitchen
Call me paranoid, I think the walls is listening
But if them walls could talk
I probably never get to see the daylight
I gave it to 'em raw mix tape after mix tape
I had niggas waiting on the album
I shoulda got five mics in the Source
Instead I got five bricks and a Porsche
They sat I ain't lyrical
I wasn't tryna impress y'all niggas
If hatin' was a crime they'd arrest y'all niggas
Kink bought the mic, I just gave him my life
The streets co-signed, the hood gave me my stripes
I said the streets co-signed, the hood gave me my stripes
Kink bought the mic, I just gave him my life
I said the hood co-signed, the streets gave me my stripes
Yeah, I know you ain't done 'em
I'm back, better than before, matter fact I'm better than ever
They can't box me in, that boy too clever
So CNN worried 'bout little ol' me
Fuck the bitch ass reporter whoever wrote the story
You motherfuckers don't know shit about me
What I been through or where I came from
When shit got hard, I stayed, I ain't run
So you can blame the government they made me this way
See the pain in my eyes, you don't see me cry
Two tears in a bucket, who got that work?
Real talk, I'll make us a way
Get rich or I'ma go to jail tryin'
Uncle Sam ain't never gave me shit
But my partner out west, yeah, he front me them bricks
How the hell you expect me to be drug free?
When George Bush ain't never done shit for me
Follow me home and tap my phone
What happened to my freedom of speech?
Love don't love nobody
Got me feelin' like, I shouldn't love myself
I practice what I preach, I preach what I practice
A hundred thou under my mattress
I'm only human, just a man
God gave me a gift to do the best that I can
Critics say I can't make an album better than my first one
The way I feel that'll probably be my worst one
Another one after that will be better than my last
So, real talk y'all kiss my ass
This is the beginning of the beginning
I am the future
You niggas are a thing of the past
I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've become
So all you ridicule lookin' I'm not the one
It's called self respect, I bow down to no man
I say all that to say you can't ban the snowmanEmbed

To see I made it
I'm on top of the world

More money, more problems, more haters, more guns
Somebody go and find the waitress and I bet you I need some more ones
I'm saying I gets it done and ya'll don't do enough
I said it's going down so what the fuck is up?
On top of my Benz on top of a bitch
No Jordan no Sherman I'm on top of my shit
I'm not dancing I'm all over the place
Remember back when residue was all over the safe?
Take them back days I went five days
120 hours, chef nigga getting paid
Not one time, I sold every dime
And my joy and my pain nigga every line
Said fuck the hygiene I want some fly jeans
That's what the bitches like, you like the bitches, right?
But why they call you Snow? Cause im the Christmas type
You see that nigga's neck? Shine like some Christmas lights
That Merry Christmas ice, that Wayne Gretzky ice
I wouldn't trade this nigga for Wayne Gretzky's life
I'm good in any Projects nigga every block
And if I have it nigga I'll front a nigga every block

Sometimes I feel so alone, a nigga can't even lie
Before that you start to trip just let me explain why
My niggas in graveyards, the rest penitentiaries
And they're never coming home cause they're doing centuries
Sometimes I look at the sky and stare at the fucking stars
Was it really all worth it for jeans and some fucking cars?
Maybe it should be, maybe it could be
But it ain't though I'm just thankful
That's why I drink more, so I can think more
Think a lot when they're hating on you, bottom is waiting on you
These niggas get in these magazines these niggas say anything
And if they get jammed up they'll probably tell everything
I put that on everything if I say anything
You can believe that, and you can believe that

How you let 'em ride your wave but a nigga right beside you still hatin'? I will never understand it
Ungrateful-ass niggas, these ungrateful-ass hoes, they gon' fuck around and sink the Titanic

New shoes on the Range Ro', I'm good wit mine (vrrooomm)
Motherfuckers acting like I ain't supposed to shine
I ain't the 1, definitely not the 2 (nope)
1 in the chamber when we aiming at you (Blaou)
The young Bob Barker, the price is right
If you C.O.D. then you could get them tonight
Put the fish scale on the scale
The boy went postal, all he do is check mail (HA HA)
Low key, under the radar
Triple black 'Vet, yeah I call it the stealth
No currency machine, I could count it myself
Almost done, another quarter million in ones
Thunderstorm in the Body Tap, look what I've done
Chump change, I make it rain for fun (whassup)

Even in the drought, the boy kept that yay
100 percent certain, Snowman was workin'
You can blame my plug and my clientele (why)
I'm addicted to that new car smell
White cookies in a plastic bag
New shoes on the coupe with the paper tag
Whole life flash right before your eyes
See the state troopers and get butterflies
Got a thing for them Heckler and Koches
Mini 14s and rolex watches
Somewhere in the back of my sick and deranged brain
I get a rush when I talk that 'cane
Get money, nigga fuck them haters
All we fear is the discovery and indictment papers (whassup)

I like little dude who keeps his money so neat
But I still bury a nigga
Put the mask on, Jim Carrey a nigga (Blaou)
Suede ends in the Chevy, got me feelin awkward
Careful with the sweets, dont burn my seats
You could live your whole life and not come close
Guess thats why these rap niggas take notes
Recite my adlibs, borrow my quotes
Make me IHOP a nigga, serve them with the toast
Next, they be dressing like me
But back in '93, they wasn't stressing like me (whassup)
