"I just called you and you said Domino's Pizza, but… and you said you were on your way, but there's just one problem
I'm all the way to fucking Rochester, New York. Wrong ho!"

Uhh, yo yo… yo, not this shit again
Dog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean? Motherfucking dog!
Don't get a dog if you can't take care of a dog
Gotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?
Take it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh
Give me a motherfucking break, will ya?

Shorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough
Come to find out she was a lil hoe, but still, yo
I pushed up, shorty had that ass like blaow
Had me scheming on how I could get that now
Was like girlfriend, let me drop a bug in yo' ear
She was mine cause I told her what she wanted to hear
Was like yeah, she knew how it was going down
She said page me, code zero, cause I know you get around
Didn't have a man, but even if she did dead
Cause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head
I said, we'll get up like nine or somethin'
Don't act like when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin'
That night was right, she let me get that, hit that
Rip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that
But only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust
But I didn't fuss cause, dog, shorty was the bomb
You might also like
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life
C'mon, ma, give me a break!

A few days later, I hit her up just to keep it real
Was like, "Whassup, boo? How you been? How you feel?"
She said, "Aight, but my friend's kinda late
Today's the 13th, and it should've been here on the 8th"
I'm like, "For real?! Don't stress it, it'll come
It better cause I can't afford another little one"
She said, "Neither can I", I said, "Cool
Cause I got mad shit to do and you still going to school"
So at least we had the same thing in mind
Not to have this kid and everything would be fine
But I was blind to the fact that she was setting me up
For the kill, damn, why wasn't she on the pill?
And I still would check on her like once a week
Sometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak
And whenever I would speak on the baby
Shorty would be like, "I ain't having this kid, is you crazy?"
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life
C'mon, ma, give me a break!

By now, wasn't looking too good
Cause she wasn't doing things that she told me she would
Like getting the price checked out for what we had to do
And it goes up another yard for every month after two
And a half, I had to laugh out of frustration
Now she's four months, I'm ready to hit the bus station
If I was still on that shit it would've made me rob her
Told her friends, "DMX? Yeah, that's my baby's father"
Her lil' stomach is shown, so now the heat is on
Maybe she'll see the light if I start to treat her wrong
Like if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me, So I played the game on her level, got sneaky
Let her have the kid, she said it was premature
Found out she was six months when she said she was four
So I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm
But she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life
C'mon, ma, give me a break!29Embed
