13 ContributorsContra Lyrics
"Now I know what I'm gonna do, I said I know"

From the hood where them niggas pack fullys
Turn an ounce of reg to a cutty
Count money with a 10 deep flannel on
SB's looking like they been painted on
Jeans fitting like they was made for me
Your pants looking like, they was hand-me-downs from your Daddy
Get at me, my fit worth a stacky
I'm in a Caddy getting head in the back seat
Rubbing on her yakki
Then it start raining, when I start cumming
So now I'm brainstorming, on how I'm gon' run it
And y'all like fags â€“ pussy? You don't want it
Gosh darn it, got heat like furnace
And I raise it like thermostat
Rolling that Thundercat kush look like Panthro
Heard you grab your ankles, take it in your manhole
That's so disgusting, I think I just threw up in my mouth
Can somebody pass me a towel?
A wetnap or something? Nigga is you fronting?
I beat you in your face, now your head like a pumpkin
Jack-o-Lantern, I'm Danny Tanner
Watching that white girl, you a dry jheri curl
You worthless piece of shit
Your baby mama begged me to suck my dick
And I ain't gon' let her, she look like Predator
You a gay boy like David Archuleta
Contra, where niggas pierce armor
It's two niggas, two guns, blowing out your conscience
You see them chrome 44's, in this bitch with thirty men
Y'all niggas know the code like..
You might also like
Feel like I got a code in like I got 50 lives
Know they wanna see the Hybrid die
But my eyes never close to meet death's cousin
I ain't never slipping, even when I'm buzzing
Staying on my guard like a boxer on a rope
You get fucked quick tryna play me like a ho
Don't act like you ain't know that, I flash it like Kodak
Now your pics is on obituary
You a fairy that touch nigga's nuts
Think he's been sniffing his own pixie dust
I think Biggie said that was rule #5
Never get high on your own supply
But he ain't never listened to Ready to Die
Or Life After Death, now he sharing living space
Tell Big we love his soul
But right now Danny Brown "Unbelievable"Embed
