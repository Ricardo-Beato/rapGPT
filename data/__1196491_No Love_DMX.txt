If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball

Cats say they ridin', but half way through and they be like
"Not Gon be able to do it!"
Just last week wasn't really nothing to it
Cat's ain't shit, sad, I knew it
You know what it is, same old rappin
Like watchin' a movie and knowin whats gonna happen
Check it, you do you I do me
The Dog gon' be alright you'll see
Been down this road before I'm sure
This is the battlefield and I'm built for war
Ain't nothin' new to a O.G
Bullshit, troubles, and hard times they all know me!
Then there's the dick riders, the insiders
But the ones that we let get in right beside us
Keep your friends close, enemies closer
I got it, now I put 'em all in one pocket
You might also like
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball

I wish I could believe, I wanna count on you
Never got to worry about me runnin' out on you
After thinking about it I see what it was for
It took the snake to make me trust more
I trust you to stab me in the back
Trust you to stuck one in your mouth
Soon as I walk out
Trust you to steal from me, lie to me
Acting like we love each other why do we?
Everything about you is crooked, look it
Fed a nigga some bullshit , and I took it
That's what I get, an old school fucking with a hybrid
Most of you talk about "try it"
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, did what you supposed to do
Ain't never even thought about biting the hand that feeds me
But Y'all motherfuckers is greedy
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball
If I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all
And that means y'all
But when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball2Embed
