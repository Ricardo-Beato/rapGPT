10 ContributorsNo Nigga Like Me Lyrics
I dropped seven tapes and it was all the truth
Live my life just like a baller do
Meet a gang of girls and they all be cute
You can fall for me, I can't fall for you
I'm in a CL6, that's the baller coupe
You fuck for cash, you a prostitute
Go to school, then girl, I salute
And make a hunnid mill' what I'm 'bout to do
To knock my hustle ain't possible
Me kill you, that's optional
Slauson Ave., I've made lots of moves
'Cause I'm a African that think like a Jew
I be doing me, watching you
Is my example of what not to do
My shoestrings stay Dodger blue
I had a hoop dream, but then I caught the flu
'Cause the routine is still lots of shootin'
And you know I'm a do what I got to do
Picked up the sack, dropped the school
Went hard to the paint, bought some jewels
Switched up my thinking to the proper view
Hopped in this rap, paid all my dues
I'm something like an Impala, fool
I'm so LA like a barbecue
These niggas talk a lot, but they wallets mute
I shop a lot, you know, cars and shoes
When I hit the block, I still rock my jewels
But I ain't one of these niggas that got a lot to prove, nah
I got a lot to do
I wake up, nigga, to a awesome view
Way these labels tryna deal with rappers
Got me fuckin' mad like I'm watchin' Roots (Kunta)
You might also like
Noâ€” No nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me (Yeah)

Haters call, now they callin' harder
Truth flies same day departure
Played the bench until I made the starter
Used to play the ball, but now I'm ballin' harder
Street nigga, can't stay legit
Next check I get I might cop a brick
Keep a tool handy, get ya fixed
Asshole for life, it's kind of hard to switch
Follow-follow my lead, I'm in front of the line
If I don't get it today, then I'm a get it with time
If I don't get it with rap, then I'm a get it with crime
Runnin' in your crib tryna hit her with nine
Two door coupe, might cop that twice
Outside was mean, inside was nice
In the hood, I'm rollin', I ain't talkin' dice
Fully loaded choppa can't block ya life
What I'm worth, you can't hop the price, nigga
My advice is don't end up hurt, nigga
Play with me, I bet shit get real
I'm ten deep with goons and they about that murk, nigga
I don't fuck with fuck niggas, I'm nothin' like 'em
Yeah, tha Truth a trip, nigga, you wouldn't like 'em
These cars and chains, nigga, you wouldn't like 'em
All this shit I'm on, nigga, you wouldn't like' em
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me7Embed
