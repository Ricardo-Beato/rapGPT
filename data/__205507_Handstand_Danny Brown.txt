I will eat on them pajamas, bite all on it like piranha
When it comes to that vagina, baby girl, you could be my diner
Just lean back, and get it, don't stop licking til you tell me "quit it"
Let me suck on that clit while you follow my head
Baby girl, I know you're with it
Ball with me, fall back on that or fantasize
And I love your thighs I can't deny
Work it like Twerk team and I think my dick want to be inside
Rolling balls 'til my dick hard, didn't say heard like a missed call
I don't really look like I'm tryna fuck
And I probably won't care about her tomorrow
Damn it ho, what you tryna do "Pour a deuce lets get chopped and screwed"
Fool's Gold, and you know, and Balmain mark down the shit
Smoking on that Frieza, nigga, got a nigga amnesia, nigga
Comatose and I need a dose, wanna get behind that ass you got
Dipping to that Diplo, throw it right when they play tonight
Looking right, thinking of dimes and I think I am gon' fuck her tonight
She lookin' ready to go, and fosho ain't gon stop
With her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall

Pop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand
Pop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand
(Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga)
Pop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand
Pop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand
(Shake that ass for a hipster nigga)
You might also like
Hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall
When her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall

Let me see what you're working with, don't stop girl keep twerking it
I'm watching you and I'm wondering if you could do that with my dick in it
She throw it back like a fire ball, hit it up, order like a house call
Want to eat the cat, beat from the back, then give that ho a mouthful
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't care when we rolling
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't feel when we rolling
Pop the pussy on hand stand, record that on my Handycam
That uncut, Ludacris, feel that monkey I go Orangutan
You ain't met a nigga like this before, eat it from the back, suck on ya toes
The way I put my mouth on it, that pussy was under a mistletoe
Throw it back to that A-Trak, one hour to that Baauer
Now she got my dick hard, and I want to fuck her in the shower
Looking ready to go, oh for sure, I ain't go soft
Got her hands on floor, and her feet on the wall
