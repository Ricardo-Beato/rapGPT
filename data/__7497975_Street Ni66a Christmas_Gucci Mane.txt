8 ContributorsStreet Ni66a Christmas Lyrics
(Zaytoven)
Huh
East Atlanta Santa
It's Guwop
Ziggy
Wanna do this for all the street niggas
Yeah, Christmas came early
So Icy winter
Go

They didn't hear a gunshot, they just saw him on the ground (Wow)
Chopper with the silencer, that bitch don't make a sound (Pew, pew)
Some niggas tried to bully me but I don't fuck around (No)
I'm Gucci Mane, the gravedigger, I put 'em in the ground (Damn)
I'm East Atlanta Santa when the bales touch down (Santa)
All these ho ho hoes know the player's in town (Ho, ho, ho)
Wrapping up a brick like I'm wrapping up a present (Skrrt)
Ain't thinking 'bout the past 'cause I'm focused on the presеnt (Oh damn)
White girl in and I call it Taylor Swift (Taylor)
People say I'm blеssed, man, they say I got a gift (Gift)
Tape them bricks to her chest, if you love me, take a trip (Mwaw)
Better not hold your breath if you waiting on me to slip
With the birds on the sleigh, I can fly the whole bomb (Go, go, go)
'Cause my right hand man, he supply the whole slums (Yeah)
Caught an elf in the cookie jar, cut off his right thumb (Pussy)
Speaking on the cartel, we'll cut off your damn tongue

It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas (Huh?)
For street niggas just like me (Like me)
It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
The kids need new J's on they feet (Yeah)
It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas
For street niggas just like me (It's Gucci)
It's a street nigga Christmas, a street nigga Christmas (Yeah)
Ain't no love, ain't no rules in the streets (Go, yeah)

It ain't all good, probably never been good (Nah)
Gucci Mane hood and he'll always be hood (Hood)
I remember ridin' 'round four deep on Glenwood (Glen)
Six Kicker 12s in my fuckin' Kenwood (Huh?)
Bouldercrest Road, man, you know how that go (Crest)
Nigga wipe your nose right around Flat Shoals (Huh?)
Gotta keep your head on a swivel 'round here (Yeah)
Gotta keep your hand on your pistol 'round here (Baow)
Never think shit get sweet 'round Christmas (No)
Niggas 'round here gettin' geeked 'round Christmas (Geeked)
Robbers 'round here don't sleep 'round Christmas (No)
Niggas 'round me damn near shoot missiles (Baow, baow, baow)
I know a nigga lost his life 'round Christmas (Yeah)
Play around cut throat on the dice 'round Christmas (True)
You gotta keep the fire, rock your ice 'round Christmas (Ice)
These checkers 'round here kidnap your wife 'round Christmas (Yeah)

Ain't no love, ain't no rules in the streets (Yeah, huh?)Embed
