Bend, we don't break, we not the bank
We all we got
Switch whips, relocate way out of state
Bada bing, bada bam
It's the puppet master, all of the strings in my hand
Peace to my mans, gotta go be with your fam more (For real)
For real, I feel like the landlord
My niggas came a long way from the Dickies and dirty JanSports
Jack of all trades, was dealing niggas a handful
Bend, we don't break, we not the bank
Got memories of your face
The photo still on the mantle
It's real when you seal up letters with wax
Shit changed, now the checks that we seein' is handsome, real
Mike WiLLy shit, we went gorilla, they really gave up the ransom
You silly, we taxed 'em, bad blood
Doing 'em dashes and pulling fast ones
Seen your heart sore, got torn up in the past once
Before a jawn, young god get the cash run
Hard hung heads might starve in the end
Young god get the cash 'fore a jawn thump
Pause wit' your man, call Mos if you can, by God (By God)
Bend, we don't break, we not the bank
Switch whips, relocate all the way out of state
Tell my queens, "Keep mace"
Keep faith, brother man
They stable full of sheep, we stayin' on the lam
Game isn't cheapYou might also like8Embed
