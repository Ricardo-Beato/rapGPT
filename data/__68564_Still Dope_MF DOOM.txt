27 ContributorsStill Dope Lyrics
I'm still dope—even if the bag ain't Coach
Even if I don't smoke 'til the hydro roach
I'm still dope—rock a thrift store coat
And a fresh pair of moccasins comfortable for walkin' in
No A&R marketin', this is my reality
Still dope, power walk, burning off the calories
Fact and not fallacy, Metal Face family
Imminent fatality, taking us too casually
I got it, it's cool, just part of the school
And I'm acin' the lesson, it's time, so quit stressin'
Still dope, vibrant, natural game
No ring, no chain, still bringin' the pain
Still dope—got no choice but to cope
Listen, take notes, I'm showin' you the ropes
Still dope—very high dosage
My approach is lights out, buenas noches
Hold my glasses so I can get Riddick
Send 'em home, tail tucked, holdin' they fitteds
Cold as a Guinness, "One pint miss!"
Yo, chill, watch the table, a fish might flip!
Crack jokes spit, pop mad shit
That's what it's made for, cop that quick
"Drop that, vic!" Butterfingers, oopsie
Signed away your publishing for Jordans and a loosie?
The old one-two, see; solo not groupie
All over they ass like sweats by Juicy
Cats is puss like Sagwa and Morris
Stay spittin' lines, there is no chorus
Deploying the troublesome, sleep in bubblegum
That's a double dumb, hum if you feel where I'm comin' from
Do it 'til ya lips are numb, you gotta go for it
I stay moving forward, I'm baby bear porridge
Knick-nack paddywack—fuck y'all critics!
This dime on the grind when it come to the spinach
Conquered the Id, vicious like Sid flow
Not a nympho, IMpress Official!
She rock mikes, you wait to exhale
She rock shows like DMC rock Cazals
She rock shells, manicured nails
Rock for every belle with a spliff to inhale
Holdin' she own cone of homegrown shrubbery
Won't go hungry, the flow too lovely
Leavin' grills dented on a SUV rented
Classic as vintage Impalas that's all tinted
Raw bidness, like how them wifeys get hitted
Authentic, the track is so love, I'm all in it
Aww quit it, of course I'm inclined to shine, did-ick
Line for line wit it, climbin' infinite
¿Tu no sabe? Yo soy una bien mala madre
Confident aren't we? Playin' it smartly
Word to Dios, Estrella is lethal
Flow muy frio, roll the dice chico
Live crazy decent insanely frequent
Strangely sleep wit' one eye open not jokin', outspoken
Provokin' and chokin', ego strokin' is lame
Word bonder than James, four alarm wit' the flame
Way ahead of the game, we still playing the same
Royalty in my veins, it'll always remain
Forever doin' my thing, solo or crew I can hang
Like ylang and ylang, bring the Yin to the Yang
They got placenta for brains, testing my venomous slang
Fools get fitted for bangs and rented for change
Some people think I'm deranged, others a little bit strange
Just tryin' to rattle my cage 'cause I'm way out o' they range
