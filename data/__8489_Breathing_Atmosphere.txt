15 ContributorsBreathing Lyrics
Take a deep breath, relax, then push it on out
Take a deep breath, relax, then push it on out
Somebody please explain to them what it be about
Take a deep breath, relax, then push it on out
Take a deep breath, relax, then push it on out
Somebody please explain to them what it be about

They can't sleep yet, too many regrets
Got em running round in circles for the respect
They need the gossip, but where's the logic?
Voices in the box guarantee a better product
So here I sit now, and watch em trip out
Trying to pick a finger to put upon what its about
But if there was a point, you would still avoid
You should've taught the boys and girls how to take apart their toys
I stay up-set, with all the pup-pets
Submerged in the drama 'cause they love it
That if they can hold the pain, and then they complain
Why would you chase away the sun if you don't want the rain?
I never asked for the world, just a portion
Tryin' to make a good soldier out of daddy's little orphan
But management called down, demanded that we turned the sound down
And with that, I suggest we start the count-down
Simplistic spiral and work your way backwards
'Til the bastards collapse and choke on their last words
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother
You might also like
Breathe in, breathe out
The sign says "keep out"
Breathe in, breathe out
Somebody please explain to them what it be about
Breathe in, breathe out
The sign says "keep out"
Breathe in, breathe out
Somebody fill up my cup before I freak out

Low profile, no more smiles
'Till all of y'all quit acting so damn wild
Slow down child, you're gonna lose balance
Too overanxious, the goods will get damaged
Girl, how many stories can you fit into a tanktop?
How many wishes get spent on what you ain't got?
The youth want truth, well thank god
Tryin' to keep it movin', while you're sittin' in the same spot
Been in this cage for a long time (long time)
Coverin' this page with the wrong rhymes (wrong rhymes)
Got a strong mind, I got a weak will
I've got bad nerves and I can't keep still
But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
I can get a little piece with my name on it
The only problem is by then I won't want it
I'm in the backyard praying and hoping for the comet
Are you lookin' to remember or searchin' for adventure?
I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs
I'm out, I wanna live around lakes and trees
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother
Breathe in, breathe out
The sign says "keep out"
Breathe in, breathe out
Somebody please explain to them what it be about
Breathe in, breathe out
The sign says "keep out"
Breathe in, breathe out
Somebody fill up my cup before I freak out

Breathe in...Embed
