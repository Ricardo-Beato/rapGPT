3 ContributorsWallabee Champ Lyrics
Yeah
One two, one two, one two, America
It's ya boy Tony Starks
The Wallabee kingpin
You know I just like to shout out to good beats like this
You know what I mean, I wish I woulda had this a long time ago
I woulda demo'd this y'all
Check it out

Ayo
Ayo, check
Banging the sounds that I invent
Fake niggas, who tried to flex hard came and went
They couldn't match up
With the fly nigga with his back against the wall
Heads clock once I came in the door
I played the speaker, sippin' a Kahl√∫a
Saw this bad bitch with a switch and yo I had to step to her
In a manner
And rather, wish the camera was on
When I had reached her, I knew that the shit was on
Please excuse me, allow me to introduce myself
Yo, I'm the man, and honey you been rated top shelf
Yo what's your name hun, hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun
Never diss 'em
It's hard for a brother just to miss 'em
Especially, when your browsing, going fishin'
Waistline banging like a bass line
Physical form is well complex
And yo I love your outline
Boo, your whole body is wild
With your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You can't strike out
Tell me what could really go wrong?
You're rocking labels
Tommy Hill down to Claiborne
Show me some love hun, show me some love boo
Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through
Ayo, peep it
I know you love Victoria's Secret
And loving all the marvelous slang on how I freaked it
Plus, you're the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash
Your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass
Your body lotion is the potion
The shit got me open like dust
And yo your  mad potent
We can go the distance, I'll put you under wings
From this  we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked a hot Arabian desert bare footed
I grabbed your hair, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it
That's right y'all
Theodore for life
Wu-tang forever motherfuckerYou might also likeEmbed
