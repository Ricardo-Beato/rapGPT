I been dreaming of a paradise
Somewhere a little Paris-like where I wanna be
Let's travel to the greener side
A lovely place inside my mind, don't you want to see?

Imagine layers in a game where we all players
No more stargazing or police car chasing
Imagine life that bring us Lauryn Hill-type of singers
Even the righteous schemers still let Christ redeem us
Life is greener on this side, the bеauty that we see
Be coming from inside, imaginе if
You a God and she a goddess
My people get free, locked up from weed charges
We no longer targets or bodies on the market
Clean water coming out of Flint faucets, it's awesome
Not being petty, but got petty cash
Everything on the path we already have
Imagine having a woman like Betty Shabazz
Steady with class, ready to blast 'til the chariots pass
To take me to my new destination
I think in miracles, it's my imagination

I been dreaming of a paradise
Somewhere a little Paris-like where I wanna be
Let's travel to the greener side
A lovely place inside my mind, don't you want to see?
You might also like
Imagine days divine, no longer in a race with time
Every day we wake up is a day to shine
Imagine you could turn water to your favorite wine
And when you taking down your girl, you can take your time
Imagine loving you enough, you don't need a like
Kids' fathers in they life just to lead them right
No longer worried 'bout sickness 'cause we eating right
Amanda Gorman poems mantras that we recite
Imagine not being politically correct, but
Spiritually direct, still giving the respect
Imagine if you could change the world through song
No longer do we have to pay back school loans
Imagine in the hood doin' our own renovations
Another way to keep the dollars circulatin'
Mountain tops of patience just to heal a nation
Since I was little, I had a big imagination

I been dreaming of a paradise
Somewhere a little Paris-like where I wanna be
Let's travel to the greener side
A lovely place inside my mind, don't you want to see?

Good times without no care
Won't you let me take you there?
Don't you want to come with me?
Don't you want to come and see?
Good times without no care
Won't you let me take you there?
Don't you want to come with me?
Don't you want to come and see?2Embed
