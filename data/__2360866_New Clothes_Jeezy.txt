9 ContributorsNew Clothes Lyrics

If they ever ask you why you weigh them O’s
Tell them mufuckas to buy some brand new clothes
Only one way to go and get them hoes
Fall up in this bitch in some brand new clothes
Grandma used to tell me boy you love that mall
Catch me bouncing through this bitch new socks, new drawers
My niggas breaking down pounds I’m talkin' straight elbows
Bout to make a play and go and get some brand new clothes

As fresh as I is baby as fine as you are
I think you been in the dark girl what you need is a star
Thanks to the fork and the recipe I’m a local celebrity
Plus I got all this creed on so you probably smelling me
Yeah I look like a fed charge bout to catch me a felony
Boy you look like some money man in the mirror be tellin' me
They say boy how you feel I say as good as I’m looking
This fresh it should be a crime read his Mirandas and book 'em
A million dollars for bail, tell the judge go to hell
As you see beat the case then I got back to my mail
They had ya boy in the county, bologna sandwiches sick
When I stepped out that county boy I was fresh then a bitch
You might also like
If they ever ask you why you weigh them O’s
Tell them mufuckas to buy some brand new clothes
Only one way to go and get them hoes
Fall up in this bitch in some brand new clothes
Grandma used to tell me boy you love that mall
Catch me bouncing through this bitch new socks, new drawers
My niggas breaking down pounds I’m talkin' straight elbows
Bout to make a play and go and get some brand new clothes

That shit that they tryna do, look I already done it
What the fuck they gone run cause I already run it
Let's just keep it 100, let's just keep it a buck
If it come out my mouth you know that shit adding up
And the way that I’m feeling I might just fuck up the re-up
Just know they won't touch my feet if them shits don’t cost a G up
Baby shoes is a stack and my belt is a rack
You know you ain’t even goin' out, you got fresh for the trap
Some nigga die 'bout this paper because they can’t live without it
Swear that shit make a local nigga buy something exotic
Just know that I blew a check, so I can get me some love
Just make it part like the red sea when I walk in the club

If they ever ask you why you weigh them O’s
Tell them mufuckas to buy some brand new clothes
Only one way to go and get them hoes
Fall up in this bitch in some brand new clothes
Grandma used to tell me boy you love that mall
Catch me bouncing through this bitch new socks, new drawers
My niggas breaking down pounds I’m talkin' straight elbows
Bout to make a play and go and get some brand new clothes
