11 ContributorsCan’t Catch ’Em Lyrics
Damn, my
Fuck 'em, okay
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em (grah)
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
Catch 'em, (can't, can't)

Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
If I stretched her, she ain't special
It's endings to this shit with this .50, it ain't levels
Fuck the runners, and their medals
Gold diggers, and their shovels
I ain't ever going broke, that's never, say never
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
My car's too special
My house too big
So thots be stretchin
And I live there by myself
Me and a lot of weapons
Money to buy whatever
Surrounded by lots of protection

Nigga say he want it beef, then slide then (phew, phew)
I'm in a car driving fast, no license with the pipe and (phew, phew)
'Member I used to fuck around, had a white hand (phew, phew)
I got my money in this Louie Suitcase but it's trifling (phew)
Cause I done spilled codeine all over it
And I was rolling weed all over it
2000 Ford with LV's all over it
I really don't fuck with G's if y'all ain't notice it
You might also like
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
If I stretched her, she ain't special
It's endings to this shit with this .50, it ain't levels
Fuck the runners, and their medals
Gold diggers, and their shovels
I ain't ever going broke, that's never, say never
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
My car's too special
My house too big
So thots be stretchin
And I live there by myself
Me and a lot of weapons
Money to buy whatever
Surrounded by lots of protectionEmbed
