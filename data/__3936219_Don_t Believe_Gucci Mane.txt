6 ContributorsDonâ€™t Believe Lyrics
Drumma Boy
Brrr (Hey boy)
Big Gucci (Hey)
Yo playa (Hey boy)
Brrr

I got a homie named Frankie (Frankie), last name Mueller
And he hang with my panky (Panky), ice cooler
And my role you should thank me (Thank me), thank my jeweler
'Cause he got me so icy (Brrr)
If another hater try to take my jewelry, I'ma probably have to go and pick a jury
I'm goin' M6 karats, can you hear me?
I'm so flashy, suckas can't stand near me
When I be a granddad, I tell my grandchildren
When I was 30 years old, I had 30 million
Came a long way from trappin' in a vacant building 60,000 people screaming such a great feelin' (Gucci)

Think he all that, he think he all that
He think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack, Gucci can't rap
Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin' to get fat checks and all that
You think you go harder but I don't believe that
And you don't believe that
Know you from way back
You don't believe that and I don't believe that
We just don't believe that
You might also like
It is not that easy
You gon' have to try harder to deceive me
Before I ever started gettin' rap money (Money)
I was wrappin' up them things like a mummy (Dummies)
Your whole crew like food for my tummy
And I'm hungry right now so its ovey
I'm the hood MVP with a trophy (A trophy)
I got five rings on like I'm Kobe (I'm Kobe)
I'm puttin' it down like my good partner Toby (Toby)
He in the feds, yeah, them people gave him 40
I'm still ridin' around the city with the .40 (Shawty)
I think what the fuck I wanna think just run up on me (On me)

Think he all that, he think he all that
He think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack, Gucci can't rap
Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin' to get fat checks and all that
You think you go harder but I don't believe that
And you don't believe that
Know you from way back
You don't believe that and I don't believe that
We just don't believe that
I just got a text message, should I say a sex message?
Say she got an ice fetish, told her get her mouth ready
Hydro got my light-headed, Lambo got her sightseein'
Not the average human bein' so I'm ridin' in European
Paid 'em and I bring 'em in, start out friends and end up fuckin'
Please don't ask her once again, they at my hotel goin' in
Gucci Mane be goin' in, fuck your throat, go again
DJ hit my ho again, tell me what you recommend
I put it down, I fly em in, fly 'em out then go again
I get around like 2Pac 94' but its 2010
17 Brick Squad Records, I'm a busy man
Stay out Gucci business, this ain't where the rings on Gucci hands

Think he all that, he think he all that
He think he all that but I don't believe that
Gucci Mane wack, Gucci can't rap
Gucci ain't trap but you don't believe that
I'm tryin' to get fat checks and all that
You think you go harder but I don't believe that
And you don't believe that
Know you from way back
You don't believe that and I don't believe that
We just don't believe that1Embed
