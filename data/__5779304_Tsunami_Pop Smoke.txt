38 ContributorsTsunami Lyrics
I don't wanna
I don't wanna wait for you to love me, no
Yeah, every other day, you got me thinkin' if it's real love
Girl, wine it, come my way
I got some my way
Girl, you my summer, give me sunshinin'
If you move to di left you not you gon' move to di right
Baby girl's back way gon' treat me right
Me wan' di one way, ah pum pum tight
But girl you do me like kryptonite

Do you want me?
'Cause girl I want you
It's pretty obvious that I wanna put it on you
I can't be with you 'cause I got a girl, I'm datin'
When you wine it on me, girl
Might end in a fuckin' tsunami
Do you want me?
'Cause girl I want you
It's pretty obvious that I wanna put it on you
I can't be with you 'cause I got a girl, I'm datin'
When you wine it on me, girl
Might end in a fuckin' tsunami
You might also like
Hunnid chains on my neck, feel like Rick the Ruler
All yellow gold like Mansa Musa
Iced out bezel cooler than a cooler
It's just me and my bitch shootin' with a shooter
Let me tell you 'bout this mama out from Brooklyn
Shawty say she like how I'm lookin'
Shawty said I look like a snack
And if I ever had home cookin' (Home cook')
And I'm like "Fuck that"
You ever had a nigga that's Wooin' (Woo)
You better know what you doin' (What you do)
'Cause I'll take you shoppin' (Shoppin')
I'll spoil you, baby (Baby)
Christian Dior (Dior)
Mike Amiri (Amiri)
Céline (Céline)

Do you want me?
'Cause girl I want you
It's pretty obvious that I wanna put it on you
I can't be with you 'cause I got a girl, I'm datin'
When you wine it on me, girl
Might end in a fuckin' tsunami
Do you want me?
'Cause girl I want you
It's pretty obvious that I wanna put it on you
I can't be with you 'cause I got a girl, I'm datin'
When you wine it on me, girl
Might end in a fuckin' tsunami
It's 2AM, from a one to a ten, you a ten
Baby, let's not pretend (Let's not pretend)
I ain't just tryna be friends (Friends)
When I'm with you 'til the end ('Til the end)
And I pull up Bentley truck (Bentley truck)
They know my chains is tucked (Tucked)
These bitches be lame as fuck (Lame as fuck)
These bitches be lame as fuck (Lame as fuck)
I'm just, stuck in my way (My way)
Oh, oh
I ain't tryna play with you (With you)
'Cause you my baby (My baby)
Let's hop on the Wraith (Oh, oh, oh)
Red bottoms like you stepped up in ketchup (Oh, oh)
Act up and a nigga won't let up (No, oh)

Do you want me?
'Cause girl I want you
It's pretty obvious that I wanna put it on you
I can't be with you 'cause I got a girl, I'm datin'
When you wine it on me, girl
Might end in a fuckin' tsunami
Do you want me?
'Cause girl I want you
It's pretty obvious that I wanna put it on you
I can't be with you 'cause I got a girl, I'm datin'
When you wine it on me, girl
Might end in a fuckin' tsunami4Embed
