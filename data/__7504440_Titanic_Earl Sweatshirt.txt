Give it to you straight, no frills
What I think might pay the bills
Spit on the cam like Makaveli (Fuck y'all, that's my shit)
Came home in the 2011
Pasadena, John calling me Relly
Ain't know where none of this shit was headed (I ain't even know, what, whoa)
In a LAC, Nak gon' protect me
Bro just crashed, fucked up his Dodge (Skrt)
Now he shopping for another HEMI (Skate fuck, rock out, wrecked the wheel)
Did the dash, got outta dodge
Crashed out grandmama car
They got tipped off by a civilian (Yes sir)
Yes sir, think I already feel it
Sweatshirt, 'cause you know how revenge is best served
Cold dish (Pressure cookin' roast)
No assist, I'm out here on a mission
Triple doublin' off of the strips
Get ghost like I need a killer (Shh)
Get ghost like a apparition (Ooh)
Home town hold me down like a rock
So you know how I gotta skip it (Skip, skip it)
So you know just how we living
Took it slow, saw what it could give me
Hit the road, go a mile a minute (Mm, yeah)
Mask on like a supervillain
Daniel, who you in the den with? Lion
Wasn't lying when I told
Dawg's on the floor now 'cause I skinned 'em
On the 10, east homebound
I just broke down with the chemist (Yeah)
Midtown, niggas pimpin' (You know how we get it)
Iceberg, MAC kinda slim
What they couldn't see sinking ships
Capsize mean you's a flip (We know you)
Send a postcard from the depth
Bleed the vein 'til nothing left
You look drained, you should get some rest (Yeah, go get some rest)
You look drained, you should get some restYou might also like10Embed
