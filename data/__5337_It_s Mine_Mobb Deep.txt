41 ContributorsItâ€™s Mine Lyrics

Yeah, yeah (Hahahaha)
Uh-huh, yeah-yeah (Hahahaha)
Huh, yo, you know it (Hahahaha)
Infamous '99 (Infamous '99)
(Hahahaha)
Infamous 2000
Ain't nothin' but thugs over here, baby
(Ahahahaha)
Yo (Hahahaha)

Straight thugs on this side, it's do or die to the death
Like the terminal ill takin' they last breath
Read your last rites, God, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit, takin' a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin' my will, you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin' noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids
Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggas love to see when
Niggas slippin' off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin' your ice, appraisin' it like the Diamond District
Jeweler with they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, wanna get caught lifted
Or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin' my wife
On my thousand dollar mattress
It's the world that I live in, Q.B. made me
A moms that loved me and a pops that raised me
You might also like
Y'all need to give it up
We don't give a fuck
What y'all niggas want
Thug life is mine
Y'all need to give it up
'Cause we don't give a fuck
What y'all niggas want
Thug life is mine

I got the style of a stillborn child, I'm ill
If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well (Very-very)
The streets raised me crazy, now I'm immune to it
So when they start shootin', we don't stop the music
Keep it movin' that's how we do it (C'mon, c'mon, Dunn)
Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin' (Still crawlin')
Apply street rules to the office, high performance
Rap author, made millions off of
Melodic, hypnotic productions
That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions (You feel me? You feel me?)
You feel me? I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggas to they grave, relate to the projects
We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music (Don't get no realer than this)
It's more real than any words I can muster
Pull the black Cadillac trucks up (What?)
Hop out them shits like what? Y'all niggas can't touch us
Y'all need to give it up
We don't give a fuck
What y'all niggas want
Thug life is mine
Y'all need to give it up
'Cause we don't give a fuck
What y'all niggas want
Thug life is mine

Silk shirts and my chest show what a flirt
Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
And I front like my doo-doo don't stink
Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin' out the latest toy
Hazard lights blinkin', gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin'
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way, we came a long way
From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, Nextel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters, wake up, guns
Under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
Nastradamus, last one to blast when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin' and flee with the murder weapon
I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson
Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it
Cremate your flesh to ashes, you don't need
A suit, no wake, no funeral, and no casket
Y'all need to give it up
We don't give a fuck
What y'all niggas want
Thug life is mine
Y'all need to give it up
'Cause we don't give a fuck
What y'all niggas want
Thug life is mine

Thug life is mine
Thug life is mine
Thug life is mine
Uh, thug life is mine
Ill Will
