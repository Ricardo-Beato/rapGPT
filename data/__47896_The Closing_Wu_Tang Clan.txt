16 ContributorsThe Closing Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
I see everything
I see everything
YouknowhatI'msayin?
It's like when we come through
You better have your fuckin third eye open
You know, cause thats what time it is, youknowhatI'msayin?
Cause it's like, when you walk, you striving for perfection
That's what we doing
Understand?
So all that little fake shit out there
We know the science on that
We done seen that shit from, from from difference of angles
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, yo kid, for real
Wu-Tang, we set off a lot of shit in this shit kid, youknowhatImean?
But you know, you know us, we play it calm, humble
YouknowhatImean?
But I just be checking out niggas darts and I be like
Damn, them niggas, them niggas is really, really, really, really, really thinking this their shit!
Uh ha, uh ha ha
YouknowhatImean?
But it's all good cause I'm the soul controller, youknowhatImean?
Rather I say we the soul controllers
The bottom line, like I said
Deal with freedom, justice, equality
You know?
Keep shining, add on
Food, clothing, and shelter
All my niggas, go pick up uniforms
Go, when you buy this album
Go pick up uniforms, for real
YouknowhatImean?
Cause don't think we doing this just for anybody
We doing this shit for certain niggas, kid
Certain people rather
Certain-certain fans, certain supporters
Certain delegators, word
What the fuck man, I'm tired of seeing these
Fake ass niggas fucking, running with the fucking globe
Ain't even, ain't even really seeing it the way it, it should really be seen, youknowhatImean?
It's like, if you going to spread mathematics
Spread it right
