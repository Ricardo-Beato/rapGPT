10 ContributorsSpaz On Yall Lyrics
I'ma spaz on yall
Go head and spaz on yall
I'm bout to spaz on y'all
We got to spaz on yall
Cause a million motherfuckers wanna see me fall
On the strength of my hood I'ma spaz on yall
Gotta real bad bitch come wheneva I call
Its so hard for me to trust her I can't give her my all
Got a gang of bitches in the club from wall to wall
I'ma get up outta state and then gone spaz on yall
I'm bout to spaz on yall

I'm on my rockstar campaign Ozzy Osbourne
Money just to burn like a fire in the forest
Holdin' on the cartridge
100 page magazine
Sippin' on codeine so I can make my thoughts clean
I swear if I ain't calm my nerves id click on niggas
I had a issue
Im too ambitious
I painted a picture
Its very vivid
I pray to god the devil dont get a hold of my spirit
Try to wash my hands
I had so much dirt on em
I grind so hard now I'm hot as a sonar
Yu rather see me suffer my whole team under
Applyin' major pressure on you niggas with no conscience
You might also like
I'ma spaz on yall
Go head and spaz on yall
I'm bout to spaz on y'all
We got to spaz on yall cuz a million motherfuckers wanna see me fall
On the strength of my hood I'ma spaz on yall
Gotta real bad bitch come wheneva I call
Its so hard for me to trust her I can't give her my all
Got a gang of bitches in the club from wall to wall
I'ma get up outta state and then gone spaz on yall
I'm bout to spaz on yall

My body full of gunja
The recipe the formula
Don't make me put it on ya
I recollect in memory
Finessin' was a sport and then I turned it to a business
Its A1FBG forever get the fuck up out my business
That crackhouse life it'll teach yu something yu can't even witness
But listen to yu gotta go through yu feel it in yo kidney
She wishin' and this my only chance and I got bitches they coming on command
No remote control on demand
Yu wanna see me win I go taliban
Ape shit behind this free bandz logo
We go loco with that coco I put that on my migo
I'ma spaz on yall
Go head and spaz on yall
I'm bout to spaz on y'all
We got to spaz on yall
Cause a million motherfuckers wanna see me fall
On the strength of my hood I'ma spaz on yall
Gotta real bad bitch come wheneva I call
Its so hard for me to trust her I can't give her my all
Got a gang of bitches in the club from wall to wall
I'ma get up outta state and then gone spaz on yall
I'm bout to spaz on yall

The pain I experienced made me colder than Ohio
Get headaches everyday but yu can't tell how hard I go
I'ma give it to yu real ain't no excuses I'm making
I'm workin' thru the bad days having patience
Don't have no idea how the haters try to interfere
For what yu done built up to this point at yo career
When yu ridin in the rarri swervin' thru traffic with yo diamonds
With glamour and glitz cause all the shit do is remind me
Bad karma I put in when I was grindin'
Hustle hard taking money this called surviving
You down bad take yo anger then you combine em
I go to the booth with them thoughts then start rhyming
I'ma spaz on yall
Go head and spaz on yall
I'm bout to spaz on y'all
We got to spaz on y'all cuz a million motherfuckers wanna see me fall
On the strength of my hood I'ma spaz on yall
Gotta real bad bitch come wheneva I call
Its so hard for me to trust her I can't give her my all
Got a gang of bitches in the club from wall to wall
I'ma get up outta state and then gone spaz on yall
I'm bout to spaz on yall1Embed
