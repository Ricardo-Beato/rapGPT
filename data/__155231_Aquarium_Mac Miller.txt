Yeah
Do you feel it?
No, no, don'tâ€”don't answer that, that was a rhetorical question
Ahem, rhetorical (Rhetorical)
Uh

Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process (Yeah)
And every night I get advice, 'cause life is way too complex (Yep)
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's sayin' the place is safe for me
I told her, "Wait for me," the make-believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Havin' dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walkin', I'm Steven Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preachin' just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah, he's a goner, fuck these prima-donnas (Woah)
I'll always wonder what happened three thousand years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me, we are kings
You might also like
I'm wearin' a blindfold, like, "Where did the time go?"
I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Baby, I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Take me away, girl, somewhere they won't be
Hold me closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind go?
Said, will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?

I'm just tryin' to make it all make sense
Uh

As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium (Gone)
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have, the curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meanings of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes (Uh-huh)
We all in search for substance (Substance)
That drugs your pain and numbness (Numbness)
Circumstances advancin' the second chance for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this comin' (Comin')
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrow's trend (Not again)
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days (Forgotten days)
Life, it works in such mysterious ways (Ways)
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say, ayy
I'm wearin' a blindfold, like, "Where did the time go?"
I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Baby, I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Take me away, girl, somewhere they won't be
Hold me closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind go?
Said, will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?

(Wherever my mind goes)
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
(Wherever your mind goes)
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?
()
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
()
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?
Will you follow me wherever my mind go, ho?
