10 ContributorsAnybody That I’ve Known Lyrics
In my past
I’d wish for something different from what's within my grasp
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
As a child
I’d try to find a way to be okay with how I smile
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
Anybody that I've known

Look at my face
So many miles, I can’t complain
I won’t complain, I don’t complain
I might complain, but still told the truth
My water stay running, but my food don’t move
I make a size 12 footprint
Make love to my wife, make music with my real friends
My voice make enough noise for the books
Then I hunt these woods to catch dinner for my children
Got me dreaming I could reach through the phone
And kiss the family goodnight then sleep like a stone
Hotel, motel, feel at home
If you play a little Nina Simone
You might also likeDon’t quit your day job, this is my day job
It won’t stop a single raindrop
I gotta get money to purchase a space pod
Then fly up to heaven in person and thank God

In my past
I’d wish for something different from what's within my grasp
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
As a child
I’d try to find a way to be okay with how I smile
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
Anybody that I've known

I'm all about the sarcasm and optimism
I'm kinda like a bumper sticker
Listen, you’re kinda like an artist, you got the vision
Looking at the mirror like it's competition
And it’s always trippin', but you’re not intimidated
We all tryna stay alive and innovative
Everybody aiming at the face of similar limitations
We all cut from the same pavement
If you and I are gonna search through this universe together
First gotta desert the center
Some of us will be mad at the world forever
And some of us don't even curse the weather
Whether or not I gave it everything that I got
It won't stop a single raindrop
But when it finally wash my finger-paints off
I'm tryna make sure it don’t spell my name wrong

In my past
I’d wish for something different from what's within my grasp
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
As a child
I’d try to find a way to be okay with how I smile
Now I've grown
I wouldn't trade my world with anybody that I've known
Anybody that I've knownEmbed
