38 ContributorsAbsolute Freestyle LyricsYou know
My mind remain on gunplay
While y'all niggas sleep like Jermaine on Sunday
The heat stay packed like the train on Monday
Yes, I lick off the time you gotta be there, (nine)
Push by the time that you get off (five)
And I pump 8's till I reach lunch break (twelve)
It's bout the time that you get home (that's six)
That's the gist homes
That's the unofficial master plan
Minus any unforeseen traffic jams
Like my songs carrying the clubs like Bagger Vance
Or getting' caught by them long arms
Like Mr. Fantastic damn
But I can't fade like Fantastic Sams and taper off
I'm a better nigga man this is Edward Scissorhands with my back against the wall
Till I'm a V12 6er I'm a 130-round clipper
As if I was Elton Brand
But I could never leave Chicago
Unless heavily cargo, my jeans heavily argo
My stride is stiff see I rides as if
I don't need a helpin' hand, uh
Pride is this, never you see I is content
I'm slick I slde, I don't slip I ride
Don't flip I grind when the shit hits the fan
Like a line drive into the stands
The shoe fits the foot the mitt fits the hand
Misfits hollow tips hits ya man
Swallow nicks when dicks hit the land like
Snoop Dogg in his wheelchair
But I'm comin' from the Chi
And I flip pies
3 14-inch rims and they runnin' on the side
West that is, yes, F to the I (West Side) throw it up
Now back to the pies
Wasn't talking 'bout Snoop Dogg's wheels there
I am Farrahkahn with the Heroin
Salvatore Ferragamo on my feet
Pair of charms 'round my neck
Skeleton Vacheron on my arm
Gangsta, runnin the streets like marathon
With 26 Ks now lemme break it down I'm the leader of the pack
That's hard to believe if you fatiguin' in the back
I'm back to the master plan
I'm up front with the Africans
They swallow birds like Sylvester
It's the French connector Cooperstown collector
Yessuh my lifestyle's the shit
They shit lifestyles of that shit
Yeah
To sum it up I'm having a nice run
You have a nice one
