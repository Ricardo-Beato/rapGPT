Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next?
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next?

Caught up in the middle
My life's a riddle
Don't let it get ya
I wanna be legal
But it's this hustle that get me richer
One love to my peoples makin' money
I can see you bubblin'
Avoid all trouble
Beware of devils, continue strugglin'
Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way
So get your mind on official business
You can be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave
So get paid
My niggas do this every fuckin' day
We parlay through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggas in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction
What's needed is unification
'Cause the world ain't hardly scared
If not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares it's there to share
All we get is stares
Because of fear, we'll evaporate
Say your prayers
And what's next?
You might also like
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
What's next?
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?

(Aye its on A3)
Makaveli tried to warn us
But niggas ain't listen to Pac
Naw (listen listen) nigga really listen to Pac
Shit yean got it yet (no)
Then you won't get it
Might as well measure 'em up
And have his ass fitted
Why
Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane
Never will change niggas wit' no name no shame
Might open ya head foe mess broke change
I stay posted like a flag (flag)
Starin' thru my rear view ballin' in a jag (jag)
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now
Time foe a change
Real niggas rollin' wit' me
Money makin' swift decision we controllin' the streets
Side track by the broads and the frauds
Ain't it strange
It's the reason so many niggas get scarred in the game
What's next?
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
What's next?
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?

That money gotta make it
What I gotta do to make it?
Do I really gotta take it?
Put this mack up to you, face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive
Just ask Kweli, doin' what we do to get by
Some niggas stick to the crime
Pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck we s'pose to do, who gon' give us a job?
So I tried and tried
Tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin' me back
Fiends kept on callin' for crack
So I supply 'em wit' that
Gave 'em a reasonable fee
Nigga don't blame it on me
Shit just look where I'm at
Niggas in gardens, LAPD is the target
Niggas is heartless, hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin
What's next?
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
What's next?
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?

Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Now what's next?2Embed
