3 ContributorsDon’t Testify Lyrics
Don't testify, don't testify, don't testify, don't testify

We got some niggas we've been fuedin' with lace
Caught one of his homies with cheese, we started sayin'
Told him , traffic and 
Offered him 5 for each key and it's crackin' him up
Now we dealin' with this nigga who be talkin' shit
Worst thing is this  robbing a brick
Normal work is on the block, it's kinda scared to come working
'Cause 5-0 dun been here 3 times and ain't searchin'
And all I had to do was take this money and cheer
Fucked around and got a whole thang
Practice the deal
Back to back, 33 ounces of crack
Rock for rock, the other 3 got dropped in the pot
Now I'm in shock
 got this wholе thing set
Instead of bringing an eighth of a kеy, 
There's motherfuckers watchin' us, we gotta move
He saw me, we gotta do what we gotta do
We hit his ass off the 
Working quickly, swiftly
Started out with a  mistake
You know the motherfuckin' rules, never get high on your own supply
And don't testify
You might also like
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)

We in a Monte-Carlo, playin'  tennis
15 passenger van with bang in it
And real niggas, behind the triggers of assault rifles
Garlic dip for all rivals
I walk down a block wid it, cops back and aww shit, you missed
Wig split, it's over with
And nobody seen shit, don't know nothin'
We mobbin, now which one of you ho's got a problem, I'll solve it
Alleviate the pain real soon, kaboom
Guess who stepped in the room, Capone
Bad to the motherfuckin' bone
With a bitch that sings songs in 44 tones, it's on
You fucked around and got heated
Well go and get your family if needed
Don't testify
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)

I heard this bitch-made nigga was runnin' in smiles
What the fuck you wanna do, nigga?
Let's take your mouth
The rules ain't changed, it stays the same
Bump a nose into
They love to read your brain , it's a shame
Niggas ain't scared to do the time
But they twitch like bitches when it comes to the time
Now, I'm in a sticky situation because you told
I gots to plot your fucking assassination
We paper-chasing
And if we feel you might snitch, twist
Let the  block the hit, we proceed to plead the fifth
Your chances are slim to none, now you wanna run
Rule number one, don't testify, you shoulda held your tongue
Where I'm from, keep your mouth shut
You gettin' touched 'cause you tried to hold us up, what!
Mr. Snuff
Lowkey, playin' a cut, that's my alibi
If you can't lie and you ain't ready to die, then don't testify
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)
You know the rules, don't testify (Don't testify)
If you don't, you live, if you do, you die (If you do, you die)
You know the rules (You know the rules)
Don't testify
You know the rules (Ha ha)
If you do, you dieEmbed
