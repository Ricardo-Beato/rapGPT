36 ContributorsFever Lyrics
Uh-huh

Early on the wake up, cunning as the father of the 12 sons of Jacob
Shake up the world, cake crumbs
Cover my gold teeth, cufflinks, waiters
Lobster sauce on aprons, pardon, that's the chef
Burgundy on the breath, uncertainty when I step
Dancin' to every song like it's a contest
Singin' to Stevie Wonder Happy Birthday
Celebratin' years of flows and crazy wordplay
Seasoned, I'm leavin' my forties, I'm a griot
Deep as Deepak Chopra, dress socks and loafers
Family only, I'm holdin' hands with a cold piece
Bow to the old me, I'm officially OG
Might throw a Roast Me, wonder what will the jokеs be
Watchin' 'em imitate my cool dеmeanor
It's a new decade, I'm in a whole new arena
Roll the dice in this life and I hit the Fever, get it!

Wolf out of NYC, this is prophecy
Know this was meant to be, evolve constantly
Half a century
Put your glasses up, represent for me
(Represent, represent) Represent for me
Represent, represent, represent for me
Fly from infancy to half a century
Ah-ha, represent

Cryin' faces for the double agents watchin' my every move
Go tell 'em I can't sit still, I never do
Let them think of all the places I led them
Go look at it through an all-age spectrum
Still winnin', never a better move
Who they claim to be today? Man, they can never choose
We all got a set of tools we gotta use to push through
Like I did and Esco is my nom de plume
Party in the penthouse, live, fill all the rooms
With beautiful vibes, that's the way to calm the goons
Champagne flutes, my cigars pop balloons
Bowties get untied when the clock hit 2
A '73 baby — I say a speech, maybe
Besides the Littles and Joneses, Hip-Hop made me
Born in New York, I hope the Most High keeps you
I wish at least fifty on all my good people, fever

Wolf out of NYC, this is prophecy
Know this was meant to be, evolve constantly
Half a century
Put your glasses up, represent for me
(Represent, represent) Represent for me
Represent, represent, represent for me
Fly from infancy to half a century
Ah-ha, represent2Embed
