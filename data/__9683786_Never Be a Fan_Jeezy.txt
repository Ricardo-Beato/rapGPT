8 ContributorsNever Be a Fan Lyrics
Yeah

You ain't really rockin' with him, just let him a loose (Loose)
And you don't know what love is, just tell him the truth
I know you said it a million times, but where is the proof?
He as loyal as they come, yeah, I'm talkin' Papoose
And all that bullshit you doin', that's disrespect
With the world on his back, why you all on his neck?
He ain't your child so, how you gon' keep him in check?
You ain't his boss, you talkin' like you gon' cut him a check
That man fightin' with the world, what you want him to do?
Lick his wounds, then come home to be fightin' with you?
And he ain't really askin' much, he just wants you to ride (Ride)
Put your hands on his head, rub his back when he tired (Yeah)
One too many ultimatums, you makin' him choose
He out here tryna make his moves, you makin' him lose (Lose)
If your plan is control, he'll never be a fan
But I guess that's life, you fuckin' up a good man (Yeah)

If the plan is control, he'll never be a fan
When it's all said and done, you fuckin' up a good man
Yeah, that's life, baby, what's up?
Gotta compete with your past, she'll never be a fan
You fuckin' up a good woman, that never was the plan
You might also like
You ain't know what love is, so just leave her alone
She knowin' that you don't trust, hear it all in your tone
Yeah, you gettin' to the bag, but you're never at home (Nah)
That's what she tell her girlfriends, yeah, she always alone (Damn)
You need to take some time to chill and deal with the trauma (Trauma)
That toxic relationship you had, yeah, you and your mama (Mama)
Even at your best, yeah, post-traumatic stress
Always feelin' like it's war, and you gonna need a vest
She ain't even got a clue that she takin' a test
Question is, how you know she ain't doin' her best?
And when you talk less, yeah, that be makin' her stress
Superwoman, yeah, she gon' need a S on her chest
Them streets fuck you up, left your whole heart froze
Like the first time you met her and your whole heart close
Gotta compete with your past, she'll never be a fan
Fuckin' up a good woman, and that never was the plan

If the plan is control, he'll never be a fan
When it's all said and done, you fuckin' up a good man
Yeah, that's life, baby, what's up?
Gotta compete with your past, she'll never be a fan
You fuckin' up a good woman, that never was the plan
If the plan is control, he'll never be a fan
When it's all said and done, you fuckin' up a good man
Yeah, that's life, baby, what's up?
Gotta compete with your past, she'll never be a fan
You fuckin' up a good woman, that never was the planEmbed
