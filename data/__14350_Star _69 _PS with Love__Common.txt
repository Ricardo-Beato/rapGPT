5 ContributorsStar *69 (PS with Love) Lyrics
Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes, Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on, that's okay, ignore the beep
For you my love is immortal deep
You are my queen, but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I reserve love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What He showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

Erotica, wet dreaming on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, "P.S., with love", I sign
Erotica, wish on star 69
Erotica, wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca, wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca
You might also like
So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
Our love, reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns, when desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (Ahh) I feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me, our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face
Your mouth half open, your love I can taste
Embracin' you, life I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

Erotica, wet dreaming on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, "P.S., with love", I sign
Erotica, wish on star 69
Erotica, wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca, wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca
Slave to your loneliness (Slave to your loneliness)
Inside of loneliness (Inside this arch we give)
With love of loneliness (With thoughts of loneliness)
Enslaved by loneliness (Oh-oh)

I want you to come inside your mind
And find a place, nasty and kind
This is where our desires grind
And where they peak is most divine
A place and time I hope we reach together
You are my queen and freak forever
I feel you inside my stomach
My body shakes (Ahh)

Wet dreaming on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, "P.S., with love", I sign
Erotica, wish on star 69
Erotica, wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca, wish on star 69

Wish on star 69, wish on 69
Wish on star 69, wish on 69
Wish on star 69, wish on 69
Wish on star 69, wish on 69Embed
