W-T-F, S-M-H (Yeah)
My jewelry is disgusting but let's discuss the taste, I'm in another place (Yeah)
This whole shit is in shambles, low vibrational levels
Riders never get canceled, never
W-T-F, S-M-H (Uh)
This ain't that H&M, this that scully over your face
Real life nightmares, enemies cuttin' your brakes
These suckers lower than snakes so watch where you valet

Demonic motherfuckers, what you do come back
God bless the trap, but I wanna see you untrapped
Plottin' on another man and his possessions is wack
One-on-one with your opp, all they see is two dumb Blacks
W-T-F, S-M-H, O-M-G (Uh)
How could you put these pussy ass rappers over me?
When all they do is cap, all they do is L-I-E
I'm L-M-F-A-O, Esco' heavy in the streets (Yeah)
Fresh back off tour (Uh-huh)
The mic still smokin', I ain't once go hoarse
I never take a day off from this fly shit that I'm on, come on
Please, get your lady off of my horn
She told me she astral plane now, she explain how
Her spirit leave her body every time we hang out
She said she got her main now, she got a king now
It's a phase now 'cause she still gon' come and put that thang down, woah (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

W-T-F, S-M-H
My jewelry is disgusting but let's discuss the taste, I'm in another place (Haha)
This whole shit is in shambles, low vibrational levels (Word)
Riders never get canceled, never


We manifest destiny like a knight
A knight in shining armor, yeah
Tryna be there for all of my kids (Yeah)
No matter how hard that is

Everybody's so quick to flip or say they with the shits
They go against someone look just like them
But when the enemy has government powers
They become cowards, they cut the tough guy shit
When they arrest, when they come cuff your kids
They give us criminal records, because of where we live
And the money is low, and narcotics are thriving
It's evil, we diagnosed with something that's untreatable
Feel powerless so brothers only have beef with you
So you on your murder shit 'cause that's what you see them do
Well, let me tell you somethin'
Many go on GBG, Get Back Gang, who gon' rest in peace?
In this land, twenty-three million layers
All we have is some givers and some takers
Have some good souls and bad souls
Some humble people, some assholes, slow like watchin' the grass grow
The crosswalk lady walkin' with the kids to school
There's a place in heaven for her, as is you
And if you don't believe in that, then slatt
Go where you going, be where you at, no hugs, speakin' or dap
I wish that we could adapt (My brother)
Pro-Black with a machete, pinky ring, a hog in the back
This is not a rap song why you callin' it that?
This is a audiobook, I'm an author on tracks
I opened so many doors, my launchpad was Main Source
You couldn't interpret the lesson, we took the same course
I grabbed everything and the shit that I came for
As soon as the DJ played Big Daddy Kane "Raw"
Bold, beautiful, dangerous
And I blocked out the hate that was aimed at us
I'm free as I ever been, I might hop on a jet to Japan
Just to eat sushi if customs let me in (Don't they always?)
W-T-F, S-M-H, I'm on G-O
2023, just might open a casino
Community love, providing jobs
Why would you try to come for me, why you ain't proud of Nas? Akinyele took me in the building first
Peace to MC Serch, how much the catalog worth?
I made it so many can have a piece of what I earn
Pushed it to the max, now it's maximum returns
Bold, beautiful, dangerous
And I blocked out the hate that was aimed at us
Community love, providing jobs
Why would you try to come for me, why you ain't proud of Nas?3Embed
