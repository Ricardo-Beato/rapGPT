6 ContributorsGettinâ€™ It In Lyrics
I done it first, before you were even in
I saw trends fore they were even in
I'm ridin in something forin
Got cars that ain't even in
Plug give me 10
Drink Rosay, ain't even out yet

Got guns, we gettin it, got shoes, we gettin it
Got racks we ain't even spent
I got 4 jets waiting for me to get it
I got Gucci, Raf and shit
Young rich nigga really don't care, Mexico, my nigga don't even play fare
Bitches livin in the world I got, swag on space a lot
Gang through my bloodline, yeah
Hit up Bari, take it out there
Put it in a body, take it to the trap
Got them bags, split it
Three bitches there, you know they there
Dropped 40K on a whip, don't even care
She wanna fuck in the limo on the low lo
My plug got that good dope
That good smoke, check my mojo
Me and Casino high off that Pludo
I'm in space, never on Earth
Got them diamonds hanging on my shirt
All them pretty bitches wanna flirt
All these hoes goin twerk
You might also like
I done it first, before you were even in
I saw trends fore they were even in
I'm ridin in something forin
Got cars that ain't even in
Plug give me 10
Drink Rosay, ain't even out yet

He's Future, I'm Stuey Rock
Got them hoes whippin up the pot
Posted in the club till they call the cops
Lil nigga I call the shots
Do whatever that get me payed
I do shots when I'm in the shade
So many whips in my new place
Which one should I drive today
And that bitch be tossin bricks, got too many bitches, how I do this
Flexin hard, you sware you rich
Now I run it back, that's my bitch
Now we big, we poppin off
All of ya'll keep falling off
You niggas be so fake, them niggas be stylin for show
In the club, get all the brauds
Go home, get all the brauds
I'm FDU, that mean I'm fresher than you
So nigga, what you goin do
Fuck with Future, fuck with Rock, choose
I done it first, before you were even in
I saw trends fore they were even in
I'm ridin in something forin
Got cars that ain't even in
Plug give me 10
Drink Rosay, ain't even out yetEmbed
