37 Contributors5 Million Intro Lyrics
Huh, huh, it's Wizzop
It's Metro, Metro, huh
It's Gucci, yeah
Southside
Huh, sizzle
Metro Boomin' want some more nigga

I'm just slidin' down the 'Crest on a hot summer day
All these diamonds on, it got me feelin' some type of way
Drop the top on these haters 'cause the top in the way
And if you ain't gettin' no money then you just in the way
Took my shirt off in the 'vert cuz the shirt in the way
If these hoes ain't talkin' bout fuckin' then they just in the way
All these diamonds on my fist, I'm feelin' some type of way
If that bitch ain't gettin' no money then that bitch in the way
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day, (Well damn, 5 million a day?)
Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day (Haha, hold up, okay, Wop)

I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 million a day
Hol' up, let me clarify, I made 5 million today
Niggas lookin' at my watch, they feelin' some type of way
But these niggas ain't get money, man they just in the way
You got a hater mentality, it's hard to relate
Hol' up, let me clarify 20 mil out the gate
10 million dollar mansion, Gucci Mane Estate
With an all-gold Rollie, match the fork and the plate
My album dropped September but I'm booked up to May
These bitches sayin' that I'm gross 'cause I skeet in they face
Why you bring your friend, babe? Man, that bitch in the way
Shit, I'm tryna fuck both of y'all, I don't like to play (Wop)

I'm just slidin' down the 'Crest on a hot summer day
All these diamonds on, it got me feelin' some type of way
Drop the top on these haters 'cause the top in the way
And if you ain't gettin' no money then you just in the way
Took my shirt off in the 'vert cuz the shirt in the way
If these hoes ain't talkin' bout fuckin' then they just in the way
All these diamonds on my fist, I'm feelin' some type of way
If that bitch ain't gettin' no money then that bitch in the way
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day, (Well damn, 5 million a day?)
Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day (Haha, hold up, okay, Wop)

I'm Gucci, pretty please, take your foot off these
Niggas neck let 'em breathe but I just can't be
I'm too rich to give a shit 'bout anyone but me
And who gettin' cheese with me cuz that's all I see
Metro on the beat Gucci Mane got a fleet
Orange 'vert, black rims, trick-or-treat on the streets
They sent me 5 Million dollars I hadn't been out a week
And I got 5 Million niggas playa hatin' on me
Ask all the bloggers, 'cause they love to write 'bout me
Then ask the mobsters, they never sold that white like me
Ask all the boppers, them bitches like to fight 'bout me
Then ask the robbers, nobody's jewelry bright like me
Guwop's a problem, nobody talks the talk like me
Guwop's a cook man, nobody holds a fork like me
These niggas liars, no money in the vault like me
I'm a supplier, nobody stops the drought like me
I'm just slidin' down the 'Crest on a hot summer day
All these diamonds on, it got me feelin' some type of way
Drop the top on these haters 'cause the top in the way
And if you ain't gettin' no money then you just in the way
Took my shirt off in the 'vert cuz the shirt in the way
If these hoes ain't talkin' bout fuckin' then they just in the way
All these diamonds on my fist, I'm feelin' some type of way
If that bitch ain't gettin' no money then that bitch in the way
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day, (Well damn, 5 million a day?)
Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day (Haha, hold up, okay, Wop)

Metro Boomin' want some more nigga
This the intro, Metro, Guccio, Wop, Wop!2Embed
