Sometimes I wonder what life's about
Sometimes I wonder why the lights are out
Sometimes I wonder why I like to shout
Sometimes I wonder what the lies are 'bout
Sometimes I see things I shouldn't have seen
Sometimes I wonder why I'm a hood and a fiend
Sometimes I look at what I've become and cry
Sometimes I get on that bullshit and be ready to die
Sometimes a nigga that's your man might get it
Sometimes even though it's sweet, you ain't with it
Sometimes the pain is too much to bear
Sometimes it rains too much to care
Sometimes if you don't watch your back it'll cost you
Sometimes you wonder who would give a fuck if they lost you
Yet sometimes the sun shines around the clock
But sometimes it's dark, and Hell is hotYou might also like14Embed
