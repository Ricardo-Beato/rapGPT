6 ContributorsRunninâ€™ Back (Getting Fat) Lyrics
{*inhales deeply*} Huh? Awww man
That good kush - this kush is PERFECT!!
I'm really smokin - DJ Speedy, track PERFECT!!
Really perkin - So Icey, we PERFECT!!
Well we the shit - my record label is PERFECT!!
(Speedy you're a fool for this one)

Run it back just like I'm a runningback
While my diamonds doin jumpin jacks my pockets gettin fat (gettin fat)
I'm gettin fat (gettin fat) obese (obese)
I won't stop man I just keep eatin (keep eatin)
Dear meat (dear meat) let's feast (let's feast)
Dear Lord I thank you for this beef
Dear meat (dear meat) let's feast (let's feast)
Oh Lord thank you for this beef

It's no sweat but I keep good Keith (good Keith)
That strong loud kush they call it Irene (they call it Irene)
Sixteen with about ten G's (ten G's)
And Spike Lee was screamin +Do the Right Thing+ (Do the Right THing)
Not us (not us) not me (not me)
Got 49 cent in my Guess jeans (Guess jeans)
And my chain (my chain) is one mill' (one mill')
That's one mill' more than your deal (your deal)
I'm so trill (so trill) large bills (large bills)
I'm sittin tall, grill it come from Paul Wall
No cocallins shawty, yeah I keep the Paul Wall
The Lil Wyte, the Eminem, you know the +8 Mile+
Gucci!!

Now it don't stop 'til the fat girls sings ('til the fat girl sings)
When it's over hit 'em with the violins (hit 'em with the 'lins)
Go {*6X*} - bring the beat back!
Do you like the violins? (Like the Violins?)
Matter fact, drop the beat and play the strings
Go {*6X*} - bring the beat back
Beat so hard I ain't gotta say a thing (say it)
One Mane, two chains, three knots and fo' rangs
Eight please, excuse me, that's fo' on both hands
I'm Mr. Perfect run Mane Mane, Gucci Mane
Gucci!!


This for my lil' brother Nate, he ain't even thirteen
Tell Meagan Uncle Gucci say good and stay sweet
Like my children and my auntie, my niece is pretty
Love my momma more than my Hummer on Ashantis
Love my brother 50 and I know that nigga love me
Love Walker Wood Warren, R.I.P. to Raliegh
Shout out to Uncle Joe and my Uncle Bentley
Speedy beatbox on the track, take it to Jamica Queens
{"BEATBOX!"} Go, go, go ahead and drop the strings
{"DAAAAMN!"} It's Gucci!!
