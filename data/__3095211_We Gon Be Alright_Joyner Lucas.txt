We gon' be alright
I gave you a chance even though you not my type
I did some things that I ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side
(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side
You had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry
So if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice
You told me "Next time there won't be no next time", looked me in the eye
And I gave you a chance even though you not my type
She told me "I ain't gonna let you hit unless you spend the night"
Then treated me like them other hoes that you might fuck sometimes
But I did some things that a nigga ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side
(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side
You had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry
So if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice
You said that "Next time there won't be no next time", looked me in my eye"
(We gon', we gon') I told her "We gon' be alright"

Woah, and I just lost my job
Yeah, I've been stressin', hoped that I could talk to God, wait
Cause lately conversations with you kinda crucial
Ever since I got laid off, you don't treat me like you used to, no
(You know how much I love you) But now my backs to the wall
Kinda hard to believe when you make it seem like you not havin' a ball
You make it harder for me when you wanna leave but I miss havin' your all
You ain't talkin' to me and it's been a week and I ain't happy at all
Listen, it's been way too long and you been actin' funny
You say shit, like you'd bend over backwards for me
Shit we've been back and forth since last December
We break up, but it don't matter cause we get right back together
I remember, I remember you said
You might also like
We gon' be alright
I gave you a chance even though you not my type
I did some things that I ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side
(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side
You had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry
So if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice
You told me "Next time there won't be no next time", looked me in the eye
And I gave you a chance even though you not my type
She told me "I ain't gonna let you hit unless you spend the night"
Then treated me like them other hoes that you might fuck sometimes
But I did some things that a nigga ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side
(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side
You had some shit you were goin' through and you ain't even cry
So if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice
You said that "Next time there won't be no next time", looked me in my eye"
(We gon', we gon') I told her "We gon' be alright"

Whoa, and my homie said he heard you complain about me
And I've been stressin', hopin' that you feel the same about me
Cause lately conversations with you kinda crucial
Ever since I got laid off, you don't fuck me like you used to, no
(And you know we could be so good together) Okay, back to the basics
I love when you tell me you trust me and don't want to go back to the fake shit
You fuss and I get all my stuff and I move back down to the basement
And plus I don't wanna be the one to be givin' up right now when I'm anxious
I've been thinkin', I've been down since days you ain't had no money
You say shit like you'd bend over backwards for me
Shit we've been back and forth since last December
We break up but it don't matter cause we get right back together
I remember, I remember you said
We gon' be alright
I gave you a chance even though you not my type
I did some things that I ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side
(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side
You had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry
So if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice
You told me "Next time there won't be no next time", looked me in the eye
And I gave you a chance even though you not my type
She told me "I ain't gonna let you hit unless you spend the night"
Then treated me like them other hoes that you might fuck sometimes
But I did some things that a nigga ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side
(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side
You had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry
So if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice
You said that "Next time there won't be no next time", looked me in my eye"
(We gon', we gon') I told her "We gon' be alright"

We gon', we gon', we gon' be alright
I'm about to be done with your bullshit
I gave you a chance even though you not my type
I don't know why you keep doing this to me
We gon', we gon', we gon' be alright
I gave you a chance even though you not my type, uh
How many times do I have to keep saying the same thing over and over again?
We gon', we gon' be alright
I gave you a chance even though you not my type
You're literally doing nothing for us
I did some things I ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side
You're just being selfish
We gon', we gon', we gon' be alright, done
Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
