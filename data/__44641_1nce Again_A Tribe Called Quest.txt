46 Contributors1nce Again Lyrics
You on point, Phife?
Once again, Tip
You on point, Phife?
Once again, Tip
You on point, Phife?
Once again, Tip
Word, watch me bust they shit
Okay

Ohhhh, you did it to me once again, my friend
I swear you do it to me every time
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo, you got it goin' on (Say word)
On and on and on
On and on and on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on

This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great, ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely, simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic, making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day, you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik, my hobby's putting MCs to the test
And if you front, I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic and never will it ever stop
Your crew is his', you might just want to call the cops
You might also like
Ayy, yo, I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog should've bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MCs and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga (WHAT?)
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fella's good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name, call me Slick Tip the Ruler

Ohhhh, you did it to me once again, my friend
I swear you do it to me every time
'Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo, you got it goin' on
On and on and on
On and on and on (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah-yeah

Yo, I've been treading on this globe, man, for twenty-five joints
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front, I'ma make more pay
'Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo, I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo, I got a crew with the beats and the smarts andâ€”
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing, never biting, ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MCs ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MCs dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me, see, I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag-along
The freaking fame, someone tell 'em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart, meaning your inner soul
And if it's real, only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game, there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself
'Cause if you ain't yourself, you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang, yo

You on point, Tip?
Yo, once again, Phife
You on point, Tip?
Yo, once again, Phife
You on point, Tip?
Yo, once again, Phife
Ayy, yo, that kid is niiiiiiiice
Ohhhh, you did it to me once again, my friend
I swear you do it to me every time, yeahhh
'Cause you stay crazy on my mind, ohhhh
Yo, you got it goin' on, ohhhh-ohhhh
On and on and on, yeah
Oh yeah16Embed
