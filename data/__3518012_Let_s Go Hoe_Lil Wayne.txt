5 ContributorsLetâ€™s Go Hoe Lyrics
What you lookin at, girl, you lookin at a G
You ain't good with your man, you're better with me
I'm fresh to death, and I'm already stackin cheese
Come and get me, on my shoulder, follo me when I leave
Let's go hoe, let's go hoe

Hot Spitta nigga, got a lot of Carbin with me
Got them rounds with me, but never got them windows tinted
Whole top here, want all of them to see me
And this bad assbitch keep lookin in my mearer
Crazy chick, she like this life I'm livin
And you aitn crazy, girl, you can tell I'm a rich nigga
I got more stripes than Nike, nigga
This green with me, all them other niggas bitches
You already know how we get down
Young Money, baby, we is in your town
Fuck a rocket, we sellin that Bobby Brown
If you love your girlfriend, don't bring her around
Come outside, you see the cash flow
Pimp in the game, and my brother and Mack, yo
Far from an amature, a nigga got money like the producer of a track, hoe

What you lookin at, girl, you lookin at a G
You ain't good with your man, you're better with me
I'm fresh to death, and I'm already stackin cheese
Come and get me, on my shoulder, follo me when I leave
Let's go hoe, let's go hoe
You might also like
Weezy baby, my money bigger, hoe
Mama knew she got it perfect, right in my portfolio
From the hood, with them birds and airplanes
Now I'm making money with the pimps, eating Shrimp
I love it, yes, I love it, I bet I could make you love it
Can't no other person do it like I motherfuckin does it
I love it, you should love it
You didn't piss me off, your other nigga does it
I'm on that fuckin Patrone
And I like it, I feel like fightin
Feel like fuckin, might just
Bring her to the crib, enter crisis
Fresh from my head to the bottom of my Nikes
Half on my dick, she ride it for the licance
Yes, that's me, lookin spicey
Open it up, yeah, it's just like this

What you lookin at, girl, you lookin at a G
You ain't good with your man, you're better with me
I'm fresh to death, and I'm already stackin cheese
Come and get me, on my shoulder, follo me when I leave
Let's go hoe, let's go hoeEmbed
