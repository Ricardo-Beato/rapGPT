18 ContributorsThe Ropes LyricsHey man, you remember Stephanie's little cousin?
Yeah, a little feminine motherfucker
Used to be scared of the football, yeah man
Nah, nah I saw him the other night down town
Wilin' out, man, it was crazy
Running around Hennepin
Waving a gun at frat boys and shit
Hey dog, I heard you got those trees
Wait dog, you can't possibly be
Even thirteen, what you doing open this late?
Ain't got no older brothers to hold you in place?
Yeah I know, you gotta get your hustle on
And life does go on and fronts like nothing's wrong
State law says you're too young to work
But a couple of bucks will put a gun up under your shirt
Coke, weed, junk and speed
Teach me another type of hide and seek
Chemistry, economics, math and business
Already a pimp before high school's finished
Even the rich kids get in the mix
Only difference is them bitches did it for kicks
And we quick to say it's just a game that's dealt
That gave you that rope so you can hang yourself
It goes
So big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so
The movies and the music taught me how to do it
And how to build a crew, and how to get it moving
Supply and demand came and held my hand
Should've seen me back then, didn't even have a plan
Only had a pistol 'cause they had a pistol
Cocked that hammer and blowed them missiles
I only had a handful of minutes
So if we gon' talk then we only talk business
Now tell me what you want from me
I got a few females, you need some company
Because y'all don't be where those junkies be
But hold up now, you gon' pull your guns on me?
Nah man, I'm a big kid with big dreams
You gon' treat me like you know that I'm only sixteen
Huh, well fuck it right? Shut my eyesight
Only squeezed out a couple and I only got double life
Big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so
You might also likeHey there girly, you got your worm early
Jumped off the branch, fly little birdy
Look around, but don't look down
'Cause you see no need to touch foot to the ground
Sex, drugs, rock and rolled up
Them older boys got you thinking that you growed up
Spent the whole day getting high
Putting work on them little thighs
And I ain't tryna criticize
You gotta live your life, you gotta get your stripes
Take aim and kiss the sky
Don't be another one wishing that you did it right
Nah, do your best, it's all we can expect
Try to see the game while it deals the death
Gotta keep keeping on, move it along
'Cause there's a whole lot left when today's all gone, now
Big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so big kid, where did you go?
We made you grow up quick, showed you the ropes
Do it up so
Do it up so
Do it up so5Embed
