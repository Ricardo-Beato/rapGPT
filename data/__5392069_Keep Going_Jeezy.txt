5 ContributorsKeep Going Lyrics
I just hopped out at the light (Light), I just gave a broad the pipe (Pipe)
I just tell her what I want, she know exactly what I like (Woo)
I just booked another flight, I just spent another night
Stay away from fuck niggas 'cause they be like Kryptonite (Damn)
They be fucking up my vibes, yeah, they give your boy the hives (Hives)
Ex-dealer, street nigga, I'm just glad to be alive (Woo)
Hood nigga, street figure, hit a lick with Avión
Sorry, Puff, I'm on your ass if we talkin' DeLeon

Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going
Keep going (Yeah), keep going (Yeah), keep going, keep going

I just killed another show (Show), I just caught another flow
Yeah, I pulled up in them 'partments, double R's on the door (Woo)
And the bars on the door, dirty carpet on the floor (Damn)
Addicted to this paper nigga, all we want is more
I just caught another vibe (Vibe), I just bought another ride (Ride)
Swear to God it came with stars, nigga, yeah, ain't never lied (Nah)
Now I'm trapping in these sports and I got my own phone
Street nigga selling water, long way from those O's

Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going (That's right, nigga)
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going (Fuck the motherfuckin' talk, keep on movin' on these motherfuckin' suckas)
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going (Y'all know what time it is)
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going (Uh, Shawty Redd on the track)
Keep going (Yeah), keep going (Yeah), keep going (Yeah), keep going (Twenty/20, nigga)
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going (Pyrex Vision, ya dig?)
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going (Uh, we raise the stakes)Embed
