79 ContributorsUp Up & Away Lyrics
Now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say "What up" in the morning
Brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began
My dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

Uh, higher learnin'
I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now
I can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri
So sing along, lil mama
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama, no
I provide for friends and fam and fans
And Cleveland City grinding, man
Stay afloat, the key is hope
I'll never let a motherfucker break me, dawg
Who gives a fuck? If a nigga don't like your steeze
Tell 'em to buzz off your N-U-T's
We don't care what people say
Dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
I ain't gotta wait for no one
If I wanna fly, I can fly for freedom, hey
You might also like
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

Wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake (Yeah)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(We'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(We'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(We'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(We'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(I'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(I'll be rolling up)

I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever
Whatever
So, whatever
Whatever
So, whatever
The end is never the end
A new challenge awaits
A test no man could be prepared for
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
The machine and the ghost within
This is the journey, of the Man on the Moon40Embed
