Mmm, look me in my eye
She don't wanna look me in my eye
Look me in my eye, eyes
Enviyon on the mix

Yeah, she don't wanna look me in my eyes
I think I just took her by surprise
She don't wanna look me in my eyes

She don't wanna look me in my eyes
I think I just took her by surprise
She don't wanna look me in my eyes
Told her I was telling all the lies
I told her I was telling all the lies
She look at me like she was surprised

She told me that her love was do or die
I told her I heard it a hundred times
I could really read between the lines
Yeah, I could really see right through the lies
See right through the lies
Told her I was seeing through her lies
And she can't even look me in my eye
I'm popping all these Perkys, getting high
I'm flying through the universe's sky
She know that I'm not like those other guys
I told her I heard it a hundred times
I told her I heard it a hundred times
Could see right through the lies

She don't wanna look me in my eyes

She don't wanna look me in my eyes
I think I just took her by surprise
She don't wanna look me in my eyes
Told her I was telling all the lies
I told her I was telling all the lies
She look at me like she was surprised

She don't wanna look me in my eyes
I think I just took her by surprise
She don't wanna look me in my (Look me in my, look me in my)
She don't wanna look me in my eyes
