3 Contributors2am on Tour Lyrics
Here we go
Yeah, yeah
2:19AM
6ix just walked in this motherfucker, I'm tired as shit
Yeah, uh
We just finished the show in North Carolina
Uh, uh, uh, yeah

Write this shit from the heart as soon as I start it
6ix supply the beat and I kill it like Leo in Departed
Back in the day when I started this shit was just a hobby
Now I see my face on the wall in the Def Jam lobby
Everywhere I go it's Logic, but it used to be Bobby
Hot as Mojave, but they still hate you, c'est la vie
Greatest to еver do it from Maryland, not a probably
Under Pressurе was undershipped and the shit sound like a fable
Fast forward No Pressure, I'm the face of the label
Ready, willing and able
I'm floating without a cable out the stratosphere
Write this shit from deep down it's out of here
Fame had me stressing, battling depression
Would've put a bullet in my brain if it wasn't for Confessions
'Cause one percent problems is still fuckin' problems, word to A$AP
Bumping A$AP way back on the first tour
Yeah, and now my wrist goldie
Shit, my chain icy like a goalie
Mighty Duck shit, I got the mighty bucks, bitch
They love you when you poor but then they hate you when you rich
'Cause everybody love a good underdog story
But deep, deep down, hate the underdog's glory
2013 I just didn't feel accepted
Like hip-hop hated me and purposely neglected
But that shit ain't true, the real ones respected
Like Sway, like Nas, like Jay, like RZA
Like the gods of this shit, I beat the odds of this shit
Years ago was at my wits end
Feel like I ain't belong on this end
And then I had a certain conversation with a person
And this person said "Do you wanna be remembered as a rapper or an entertainer?"
Shit was a no-brainer
In an instant it changed my life and all of my views
Don't change yourself for streams and YouTube views
And the person who gave me that advice is no other than Donald Glover
A person who also didn't feel accepted
So thank you for the talk 'cause deep down you know I kept it 'cause you stayed yourself
Stayed calm, stayed collected
And let me know that I can be myself no matter how eclectic
God damn, conversations with you and fam
Most definitely shaped me into the man that I am
And on the real, I think that's enough said
So thank you for the words that repeat up in my head
And nothing but love to fam for all the life that you shed
Most people never say this shit 'til the other one dead
But we all alive and well, you are appreciated
This was food for thought in a way that I never been fed
But on the real, I think enough has been said
'Cause it's 2AM on tour, and I'm ready for bed
You might also like
Yeah, I'm ready for bed, yeah
Yeah, yeah, appreciate it, yeah
Tired as fuck, I'm out of this bitch, yeah
Alright, let me hear that shitEmbed
