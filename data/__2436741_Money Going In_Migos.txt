8 ContributorsMoney Going In Lyrics
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out

Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out

Everything cool when they money going in
And everything bad when they money going out
Don’t want the people running in yo house
So the best thing you do is close your mouth
Never never snitch thats what daddy told me
And I never serve a nigga that sleep off in the streets
He told me If I try em then I’m gonna need heat
So I keep a Mac-11 tucked under my seat
I’m a goon gorilla so I call up Willy B
2 cup sippin on something light pink
Diamonds clear like water you can dive off in the sea
Designer I paid for it sauces all on me

Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
You might also like
Money going in and out like intercourse
Gave my mamma 8 bands just to go to the store
Gave my bitch 5 bands just to seek and play
Front my migo the work cause he said he wanna serve
Lil cuz said he wanna be a trapper one day
I said not to do that cause its not the right way
He said big cuz how am I gonna get the cake
I gave him 10 bands told him gone put that shit away
It put a smile on my face, every time i see my cuz he got a smile on his face
Try to take my money know i be strapped up with the wooly

Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out

Money Going in like a plug in the wall
Fuckin with the BMG leave ya hostage like saw
Whatcha need I got the soft and the stupid ass raw
Hit the stupid ass raw end up with the lock jaw
The pack hit ya hard make ya have flashbacks
What you got petroleum you know thats the gas
Hit ya bitch once then I threw her off the glass
You know I had to pass but don’t call me Steve Nash
Lost about a pound to the motherfuckin’ feds
Money coming in we got the long bread
Money coming in cause the money get finessed
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going OutEmbed
