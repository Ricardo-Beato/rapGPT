...Team Show and it's about that time

Peace world and welcome the World's Supreme Team
And I will let everybody know, right now
Wake up your mother, your father
Your sisters, your brothers, let them know
That the World's Famous Supreme Team is officially on the air

Yeah, it told black men's time's up
O.C. how they do when you climbs up
Yeah, see how it is when it lines up
You never know how it all winds up
But the journey's fascinating
Outside by the stores where they had you waiting
Trying to get that news and your radio
Yo don't let the dial roll pass the station
Is you all the way tuned in, this is so Sheep
This is Good Times, born from a slow week
Imagine every day's like five years
Now, do the math for my peers
Wow, one week's like a lifetime
Hey, ballpark in the nighttime
Wow, long blade when the knife shine
Damn, I'm just try to have a nice time
You might also like
This is total recall
Like catch the groove with big beats y'all
Not rock and roll and freak freak y'all
Just hear the words that we speak y'all
Ah Total recall
Just Krush, The Groove and Beat Street y'all
You can live the life with big dreams y'all
It's the World's Famous Supreme Team y'all

You are listening to the World's Famous Supreme Team show
I wanna say peace to all the gods out in Madison New Jersey
I also like to say peace to the brothers at Asbury Park
We was up there just the other day, we're gonna be doing
A party up there short, so stay tuned for that information

Feels like the days of eighties
81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89
Bounce, rock, skating daisy lady
For the hickies on her neck that you gave your lady
Spent the next two decades raising babies
Man the Ville could have made me crazy
But I'm so sane, so fly, big rings and gold chains
Big planes and bring in the cocaine
Running Miles, Mingus and Coltrane
Try to soothe my soul
But I rather write lines try to prove I'm cold
So cold like the twelfth month
But I can't let myself pond
I got to go for it like parcels
Cause they just want to put us in them small cells
I know they hope this man will fall
But Doctor King on my nana wall
And old-timers on the front bench
And they told me I should stand tall
So I keep my head in the clouds
And try to get to the park, ahead of the crowds
Everybody in the hood got they radio's loud
But ain't nobody better than ours, turn it up
This is total recall
Like catch the groove with big beats y'all
Not rock and roll and freak freak y'all
Just hear the words that we speak y'all
Total recall
Just Krush, The Groove and Beat Street y'all
You can live the life with big dreams y'all
It's the World's Famous Supreme Team y'all

That's right we have Doctor Rock and the Force MC's
They in the house tonight
They will be doing a little something
Yes see, Allah Mathematics is in the house
 T.C., Stevie D, 
Stay tuned for Doctor RockEmbed
