8 ContributorsG-Wagon Lyrics
Uh, yeah
Uh, whoop-whoop, trey
Aye this one right here ain't even about the money bruh
Already know, yeah
Let's do this shit one more time on these niggas man
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Uh, I said I hopped up out that g-wagon
Glock got my Balmain jeans sagging
Uh, and my wrist look like a disco
Uh, translation I'm the shit ho
Uh, half a ticket at your mama house
Uh, in all 20's in your mama couch
Uh, we drop them bitches in the microwave
Uh, I made a million with that microwave

Trey right back to shining on these pussy niggas
Uh, been a minute, perfect timing on these pussy niggas
Uh, ask about me state to state, bitch ain't nothing to fake
Uh, they know my new estate, yeah it got a lake
Bitch got a camera phone and she taking pictures
Bitch I'm shell shocked, it's making me suspicious
Right outside the spot, I'm like "fuck em"
And if I cut the nigga off you know I didn't trust him
You might also like
Uh, I said I hopped up out that g-wagon
Glock got my Balmain jeans sagging
Uh, and my wrist look like a disco
Uh, translation I'm the shit ho
Uh, half a ticket at your mama house
Uh, in all 20's in your mama couch
Uh, we drop them bitches in the microwave
Uh, I made a million with that microwave

These bitches on me, huh
These bitches want me, huh
They ain't gon holler at you niggas cause you phony, huh
Well you ain't never lie
Yeah bitch I'm certified
I lost a million ran up, shit left me traumatized
You out here ball capping you like them rap niggas
I'm in the zone wrapping, I'm like them trap niggas
I'm sitting on new leather, I'm screaming "who better?"
You came with that nigga? Bitch you should do better
What's happening?

Uh, I said I hopped up out that g-wagon
Glock got my Balmain jeans sagging
Uh, and my wrist look like a disco
Uh, translation I'm the shit ho
Uh, half a ticket at your mama house
Uh, in all 20's in your mama couch
Uh, we drop them bitches in the microwave
Uh, I made a million with that microwave
Arm and hammer, here we go, here we go
He gon' be mad at him (why?) water on the floor
Told my jeweler "go make it flow", that water on my wrist
Canary diamonds in that motherfucker, I like yellow piss
Uh, glass handle, glass pot
Bounce back, yeah, I'm sir mix a lot
Looking at my Rollie, that bitch say 6 o'clock
That duffle bag from Wal-Mart that bitch hold 60 blocks, trey

Uh, I said I hopped up out that g-wagon
Glock got my Balmain jeans sagging
Uh, and my wrist look like a disco
Uh, translation I'm the shit ho
Uh, half a ticket at your mama house
Uh, in all 20's in your mama couch
Uh, we drop them bitches in the microwave
Uh, I made a million with that microwave

I just want to give a shoutout to all the niggas that turned their back on me. All the niggas that switched sides on me. All the niggas that ran to the other side like the grass is greener. Haha I want to shout out you pussy niggas, you'll see me ball. You will see me ball, you bitch ass niggas what's happening?3Embed
