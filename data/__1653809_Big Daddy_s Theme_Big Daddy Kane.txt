6 ContributorsBig Daddyâ€™s Theme LyricsYo Tone
Play me some more pimp shit
And you know Mister Cee, when I was leaving my house this morning
The young lady I was with she said to me:
Big Daddy, don't go, Big Daddy, please, please, don't go
I said: Baby, I got to go take care of business
And you know the romance with no finance is a damn nuisance
Ain't that right Ace?You might also like1Embed
