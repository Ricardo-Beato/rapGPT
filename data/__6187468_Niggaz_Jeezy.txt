6 ContributorsNiggaz Lyrics
Niggas all the same, niggas play them games
We don't do priorities, niggas want the fame
Niggas take the mortgage money, buy 'em a new chain
One thing about a broke nigga, they just gon' complain

Niggas just killed that nigga, nigga just pulled that trigger
Niggas just came home early, all 'cause he told on his nigga
Nigga gon' rock that ice, nigga gon' take your life
At the red light, no license, nigga gon' take that right
Nigga fake band that Gucci, nigga start rockin' that Dolce
Say he don't really fuck wit' me, nigga don't even really know me
Nigga gon' say hе rich, then he gon' fuck your bitch
Then hе gon' drop a mixtape, nigga gon' ice his wrist

Niggas all the same, niggas play them games
We don't do priorities, niggas want the fame
Niggas take the mortgage money, buy 'em a new chain
One thing about a broke nigga, they just gon' complain

Nigga gon' look you in the face, nigga gon' tell you a lie
Popeyes ordered all wings, nigga gon' give you a thigh
Another nigga say he can't do it, nigga ain't even gon' try
Nigga gon' sell you a dream, say they all down for your team
Sell they own soul for a chain, nigga cross you out for some bling
Nigga want a brand new coupe, nigga want to smoke like Snoop
Every time a nigga hit the strip club, nigga want to fuck like Luke
Don't try the wrong nigga in the strip club, nigga might fuck 'round and shoot
You might also like
Nigga ain't takin' no blame, nigga ain't sayin', "I'm sorry"
Nigga shot all up in it, nigga want to go see Maury
Niggas ain't got no goals, niggas ain't got no hoes
Nigga might smoke a whole zip, some fuck nigga killed Nip

Niggas all the same, niggas play them games
We don't do priorities, niggas want the fame
Niggas take the mortgage money, buy 'em a new chain
One thing about a broke nigga, they just gon' complainEmbed
