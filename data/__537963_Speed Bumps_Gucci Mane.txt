15 ContributorsSpeed Bumps Lyrics
(Mike Will Made It)
BURR! It's Gucci!
Huh, Mike Will, BURR!

I'm in the kitchen cooking babies in my long johns
3 Swishers put together, that's a long one
I got a Bankhead bitch, that bitch from Zone 1
I said the trappin' gonna catch up in the long run
I'm in the kitchen tryna make it do the long jump
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps
Look like speed bumps, look like speed bumps
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps

I swear I seen it, you never seen it, I really seen it
1017 and what’s the meanin, y'all really mean it
The cleaners, blocks in your tires and you can’t peek the meters
When I scream it, I really mean it, won’t see the evening
Man, I’m freezing, so fuckin cold that it got me sneezing
There Four Seasons, these stripper hoes will suck me till I'm sleepin’
Leaving Magic, I’m drunk as fuck, so you know we weavin’
Ain’t no secret, you niggas know that I don’t fuck with Jeezy
It was tragic, wars everywhere, they say the boy was bleeding, it was easy
I eat yo crew up like some Reese’s Pieces
This is street shit, so once you say this shit you can’t delete it
Twice a week, bitch, my plug would pull up, and drop me off the pieces

I'm in the kitchen cooking babies in my long johns
3 Swishers put together, that's a long one
I got a Bankhead bitch, that bitch from Zone 1
I said the trappin' gonna catch up in the long run
I'm in the kitchen tryna make it do the long jump
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps
Look like speed bumps, look like speed bumps
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps

I bought all of the sessions, ain’t no sessions left
A 150 bottles, but I’m by myself
I’m fresh as hell, pocket full of dollar bills
On the real, I buy the deal, I push weight like I’m in the gym
You better chill, before I kidnap and ransom one of your relatives
And when that pistol is in your face, you have no choice, you better kill
None of y’all niggas got better dope, none of y’all niggas got better pills
Y’all don’t know about popping seals, too poppin' mills, re-rocking squares
It's Gucci Man and Mike Will, so you chillin’ with a bunch of players
Say that you's a gangsta bitch, but came in with a bunch of squares
Louboutin's with pony hair, in magic with money bear
TIP Kuntry Mac Boney there, I’m wasted standing on furniture

I'm in the kitchen cooking babies in my long johns
3 Swishers put together, that's a long one
I got a Bankhead bitch, that bitch from Zone 1
I said the trappin' gonna catch up in the long run
I'm in the kitchen tryna make it do the long jump
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps
Look like speed bumps, look like speed bumps
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps4Embed
