6 ContributorsLondon Girl Pt. 2 Lyrics
Uhh, yeah
50, part 2

She so sophisticated
I think she underrated
She happy that I made it
From the US back to the UK

She's-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl
She-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl

She-she's suck me 'til I came then she suck me more
She sucked me with a condom then she suck me raw
She a freak, my-my London, girl
It's not another bitch like her in the whole wide world
Hey, Tony (what, bruh?) I think I'm in love
This bitch licked all over my ass-crack (uh!)
From the window she went to the wall
From the tip of the dick to the ball
I mean the freakiest shit, she do it all
Went from RedTube, Tube8 then YouPorn
I told her Lil' Kim said it: "Take it in the butt!"
I'm done, she did it, she's a bad ass, what?
You might also like
She's-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl
She-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl
She's-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl
She-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl

I left her on my bed, she was masturbating
She told me give it to her, quit procrastinating
She's just like me, this is fascinating
She's a freak, I'm a freak, isn't this unique?
We'll be fucking for an hour
I cuff her to the bed, I'm not a cop
I'm an outlaw, Billy The Kid
Roleplay all day
Staircase, hallway, rooftop
S-E-X non-stop
See the scenery, same position
My ghetto Kama Sutra's ill, now listen
She flexible, I make her do yoga
Twice a day I'm bending her over
She's-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl
She-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl
She's-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl
She-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girl

I just came from the USA
Now I'm back in the UK
I just came from the USA
But now I'm back in the UK (AY!)

She-she's my London girl
(I make it look easy, man, damn!)
She-she's my London girl
My-my-my London girlEmbed
