10 ContributorsPicture Baby Lyrics
Thugger
Take your picture, baby
Nah, you okay with me, know what I'm sayin'?
You okay, babe
Hey!

Take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your, take your motherfuckin' picture, baby
(And why?) Ta-take your picture, this a Kodak moment
You know I want it, plus I wanna take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your, take your motherfuckin' picture, baby
Take your, take your motherfuckin' picture, baby
Take your picture, baby

Okay, you like it when I grind on it?
I ain't gone ever ever stop grindin' on ya, no way
And I ain't gone ever ever deny it, homie
No way, no way, no way, no way
And I'll be a buster for it, no rhymes, homie
Sailing on these boats like a Gilligan
Thinkin' bout another million
Known to be seen with no silly 'ns
If my jewelry come up missin', man
I'ma be back with like a million friends
We gone try to kill all your siblings
We gone try to kill all your fucking kin
Take a picture of me right now
If I sit there, that's a swaggin' seat right now
Fashion still my passion, 2,000 on white feet right now
Ferrari, bitch, I'm smashin', all black with the red seats right now
Molly white like ashes, got em bitin' down on my teeth right now!

Take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your, take your motherfuckin' picture, baby
(And why?) Ta-take your picture, this a Kodak moment
You know I want it, plus I wanna take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby

Take your, take your motherfuckin' picture, baby
Take your, take your motherfuckin' picture, baby

Take your picture, baby, P-I-C
P-I-B, I'm a Blood, oh my gosh to me
What the fuck? Up my prices, they'll look at my feet
You could skate on my jewelry, bitch, BC
Crystal cut diamonds, man, that's for my B
Real bosses carry Booker's, bitch, tell em please
Real bosses don't fuck hookers, we too fuckin' neat
But she can get below my dick and get Molly knees
She's here to sex out'n the fuckin' street
Beast, got a collar like a fuckin' leash
Peep, this, take your picture miss
But I'm too quick, you might fuckin' miss, yes
Take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your, take your motherfuckin' picture, baby
(And why?) Ta-take your picture, this a Kodak moment
You know I want it, plus I wanna take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your picture, baby
Take your, take your motherfuckin' picture, baby
Take your, take your motherfuckin' picture, baby
Take your picture, baby2Embed
