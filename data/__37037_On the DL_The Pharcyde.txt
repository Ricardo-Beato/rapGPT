30 ContributorsOn the DL Lyrics
So here it is, fuck it, friends or no friends
I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the ends
Of my term, I hate worms, so I'ma bring in the fish
And induce my backhand to refrain from my fist
Yeah, I wish that I changed, then I could shed all the mane
You trippin' on my ego, but all my shit is sustained
Order, order, I cross the border for a spot in the sun
I'm so down with myself, bitch, I could chill as a bum, ho hum
Drum, I'm so burnt that I'm beat
I got my peers on my nuts and the crowd on my feet
The only one who has my back is me, in reality, see
I'm constantly fighting envy when we journey through the sea
Oui, oui, monsieur, I'm true to the game, I believe, my friend, you slip me
Yeah, I might have the ego, but you'll tell me who is tripping
I know and it shows, I can look at your nose
And just tell that you're affected by the E-G-O

On the downlow
On the downlow
On the downlow

I woke up in the morning to a girl who's butt's soft
Gotta brush my teeth, clean my nuts off
Put on the gear that I'ma wear throughout my day
But before I take a shower, I ain't ashamed to say
When I think of the night before and the heat of passion
Your big brown booty, my mind starts flashin'
I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you or just stroke my knot?
While my girl is asleep, I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom with cocoa butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me, locked it very tight
Thinkin' of all the nasty things we did last night
Slipped out my underoos, sat on the toilet bowl
And let the hand I hold the mic with take control
Closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real
I'm thinkin' about the crazy ways you made me feel
As my thoughts get deeper and a little more intense
If you don't know what comes next, well, you're just too dense

(Man)
On the downlow
On the downlow
(Me and you, Pharcyde, you know what I'm sayin'?)
On the downlow
(Dude, this is it, man, damn, Tre)

He's chasin' me, scrapin' my knee on the cement is what I did
What dug? Look under the rug and I got it
Hit him in the heart with my night stalker slug
But know, this nigga had to go
Peep this, I was asleep, he climbed in my window
Grabbed me around the neck, said, "Scream and you're dead"
I thought it was the devil 'cause his face was glowin' red
He was a brother, but this brother had the devil in his eye
He was out to get I-M-A-N-I
First, I took my trigger finger with a wiggle
The devil jumps into my eyes and then I giggle
In the back of my head, you know Imani feels no shame
I grab my nine and said, "Watch my millimeter go bang"
I got him, he's crippled, so he crawls across the floor
He's bleeding everywhere and now he's reachin' for the door
Bang, bang, bang, yep, I got him again
His story's soundin' sad like the movie Ben
But, um, anyway, I'm just protectin' my shit
'Cause if it wasn't me he's killin', then my moms might've got it
It's on the downlow
Don't tell nobody I killed him, alright?
On the downlow
On the downlow
On the downlow
'Cause you should know
On the downlow
On the downlow
On the downlow
'Cause you should know

Flip fly, caught you soarin' sky high
But a fly slip wash you up fly drip, my
Eyes cry, tears fear
A baby eagle seagull shit falls quicker than a local hero
Zero from zero leaves nothin', now ain't that somethin'?
And all this time you've been wantin' somethin' for nothin'
The crew has pushed your button 'cause your frame is on recall
The homies kick the fact 'cause its whack to let you fall
Homies don't want you rollin' in the 'hood to niggas that don't want you
And you're fucked, crazy fucked like the slut Heather Hunter
Would be the one to punch her, shit, I know you'll get the boot
With the cars and the girls and the ego and the loot, G
I'll make this brief, I'd be lyin' through my teeth
If I told you you was dope and your benefits was reaped
From an ego, those zero kids are creepin' with the steel
And you're cappin' 'bout this rappin' and they're cavin' in the grill
On the downlow
On the downlow
On the downlow
'Cause you should know
'Bout the downlow
On the downlow
On the downlow
'Cause you should know4Embed
