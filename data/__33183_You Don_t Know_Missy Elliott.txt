6 ContributorsYou Donâ€™t Know Lyrics
Now, see
The one thing I like about the niggas
Is that they can fess up to one of they boys
That they been sleepin' wit' the same chick
And laugh about it
But, see
A woman, could never admit to another woman
That she been sleepin' wit' her man
Cuz if that ever happened to me
I would call your house and be like, "Yo-"

Don't you gotta man?
Why you fuckin' wit' mine?
See, I been through bad times
Get yo' mind off mines
You must be lonely
Why you messin' wit' me
But it won't be easy
To get my baby

You don't know who you messin' with (Hmmmm)
Most of them leave with the car doors bent (Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea)
I'm so pissed, you gon' make me flip
Hello? Hello?
Who dis? It's Mo'
Imma teach you not to touch my shit
For real? Hello?
You might also like
I be callin' his house, when you're not around
Don't make me warn you
You know how I get down, down
Somebody told me
But I ain't trippin' off you, nah
If you were doing your thang
He'd still be wit' you

You don't know who you messin' with (You don't know)
Most of them leave with the car doors bent (Daily, daily)
I'm so pissed, you gon' make me flip
Hello? You know who this is, bitch. Heh! Yeah
Imma teach you not to touch my shit
Yo, who this for real, man, hello? You know who it is

I can't believe you would ever do that
(Hello? Hello?)
Can't you show me some respect?
(What? Yo, who dis for real, man? Mo', this is Mo', this is Mo'
You playin' a little bit too much, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, this ain't no game)
Is it cuz you're just a reject? (This is not a game Oh, ok)
Gotta keep your ass in check
(Yeah, what? You on some real bullshit now
You know-you know what?
Why don't you just come to my house, bitch, you know?
Yeah, I'll come through!)
I can't believe you would ever do that (Yo, where you live at?)
(Ask your nigga where I stay at)
Can't you show me some respect?
(Please, he ain't got nutin' to do with this He know! Heh
He ain't got nutin' to do with this He know!
Ask him where I live at, aight?
You on that same stuff you was on last year)
Is it cuz you're just a reject?
(When I had to come through there last year, What!?)
Gotta keep your ass in check
(And I'd do it again cuz I want, I-I-I'll come!
You ain't keepin' nutin' in check, you better keep your man in check
And keep him from around my house Please, I will beat that ass
Bitch! You know I will)
You don't know who you messin' with (You don't know x2)
Most of them leave with the car doors bent (Car door oh-oh)
Blow out heat like I'm a air vent (Oooh ooh ohh)
Hello? Trick, you know who this is, don't front
I'ma teach you not to touch my shit
Yeah, I'ma teach you not to touch my shit, bratttt

You done took it too far! (Uh oh)
I'ma hop in my car and I'ma  you up, bitch!
You done took it too far! (Uh oh)
I'ma hop in my car and I'ma  you up, bitch!
You done took it too far! (Uh oh)
I'ma hop in my car and I'ma  you up, bitch!
You done took it too far! (Uh oh)

Cuz I'm that chick, yo, that same chick
But I ain't wit' playin' that game shit
Start callin' that name shit
And I'ma get on that same shit (Uh huh)
That new shit
That "call your crew" shit
That "what you wanna do" shit
The boy is yours?
Keep that nigga!
Beat my ass? Prove it!
You been suckin' his dick (Ahh)
Tastin' my clit (Uh huh)
Just a side chick
On the side, bitch (What?)
I'm the prize, bitch (Uh)
Keep it silent

You be dialin'
911 to tell the family

'Round yo' crew, you's a bad bitch
Yo ass be talkin' mad ish
Toe to toe, shoot the five
Girl, you'll get that ass kicked
What you think I'm gaming?
Shit is real, I ain't playin'
("Oh, lord! Not my baby!")
Yo, I got ya moms prayin'

It's gonna get risky
Fuck wit' Missy
I'ma shoot you where your ribs be (Oww)
So you can feel me
Ain't it real, B? (Uh huh)
So filthy and you're mildy
Not appealin'
Drum roll!

Uh oh
You done done it now
Uh oh
You done done it now
She's mad
What?

I'ma let them two girls fight
While I'm outEmbed
