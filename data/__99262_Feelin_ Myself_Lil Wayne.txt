11 ContributorsFeelinâ€™ Myself Lyrics
Aight check this out right
I go by the name of DJ Khaled
My nigga Birdman say yo Khaled man
Lets do something for the streets
Listen...

Shh...
D-Boy in the B-U-I-L-ding
He who buy and sell things
Feds hear my cell ring
Phone we say ice cream
Home we say white (Hello)
In jail they don't say too much the codes ain't safe enough
So i'll be on the street and on the road gettin' my paper up
Full but I ain't ate enough
I'm good but I ain't great enough (Uh Uh)
Aye tru turn the faders up
I'm waking up I'm taking up the industries space and I'm wastin' 'em (Yea)
They can't look me in my face and I'm grillin' 'em (Bling)
How my smile worth a million (Ha)
Because diamons are forever
Pluck a diamond from the bezel
Feel the clarity that twinkle on the little one
You might also like
Aye
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' it
I'm feelin' myself
Aye what is this feeling?
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' like....
You got to feel me!

I spit switch blades for the bitch made
I spit sweet lemonade for the pretty babes (Haha)
I spit bullets at hood niggas
Don't get shot get low boy!
I spit numbers for the dope boys
And the dope boys (Yea)
I tell 'em to meet coke boy
It's more money involved
Yea
More money more problems
More problems to solve
Big Gleezy got 'em (Gleezy!)
Ask a nigga have I ever been in the back of a car
Lookin' for other niggas after dark (Lil' Tune)
They'll tell you what's up
I ain't bad as fuck but I'm tough enough
That's why...
Aye
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' it
I'm feelin' myself
Aye what is this feeling?
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' like....
You got to feel me!

People try to tell me shit but I don't want to hear 'em
Cause if I tell 'em shit back
Then I'll probably scare 'em
Truth be told I'm the hottest of my era
There will never be a soul that can compare to every level
Ever peddled by the Devil
Me being the Devil
Yep
Hot Boy 'till the grizzle
Gone 'till they miss me
And that's until the blunts burn out
And the liquor is empty
I ain't trippin' cause I did me
Wait I'm trippin' cause I'm still me
Still the little nigga goin' out to get me
If the public got something to say
Well tell them I got something to say
And that is...
Aye
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' it
I'm feelin' myself
Aye what is this feeling?
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' like....
You got to feel me!
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' it
I'm feelin' myself
Aye what is this feeling?
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' like....
You got to feel me!2Embed
