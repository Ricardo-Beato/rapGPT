4 ContributorsNo Bootleg DVDs (Interlude) Lyrics
DVD's, got dem bootleg Idlewild DVD's
What chu got? What chu got?
What's up Sean?
Come here man, come here, come here, come here, come here
Got them bootleg Idlewild DVD's
Got Girls Gone Idlewild
I got the uncut version of the Idlewild
The G version just in case
You don't want to see Three take his shirt off
I got the director's cut of Idlewild
I got that kush man, I got that 'dro
I got that purp', I got that light pink
Let me see your teeth
Boy I can make you a grill, right now
Gimme two, naw, your shit kinda buck
Give me about thirteen minutes
Dig what I'm sayin'?
Shit, I heard Big and Dre are
Supposed to be comin' up here right now anyway
Well shit man, let me drop on out of here man like a roller coaster baby
I'll get up witchaYou might also likeEmbed
