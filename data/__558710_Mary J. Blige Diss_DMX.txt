7 ContributorsMary J. Blige Diss LyricsOooh you remind me, yeah
You remind me of such sweet memories
You know what this is
You know what I'm sayin?
Check it out
Uh
Mary J - what's on your brain
Don't you know you can't diss where you came - from
The motherfucking slum
You remind me of when you was a bum
Crazy dumb - getting hit in the hallway
Building 5 - I heard you take it all ways
In the ass and especially the mouth
You get on the radio and now you're from down south, the Bronx, or Brooklyn
Anywhere but from the Schlobohm
Sure you know the place that you left your mom...
I'm from motherfucking Y-O
Where the niggas is real and the bitches act like they know
You fuckin ho, you know I know
Cause my mutherfucking man Knock told me so
So did Little Jo, Big Coup and Derrick
Wash from School Street and can't forget Eric
Ain't you tired of getting hit with dicks
You even fucked my man Charles Oakley from the Knicks
You shouldn't use sex to get away from ???
You got niggas trooping to Fordham Road
Just to drop a load
Bitch you shouldn't have hoe'd
Everybody got your code
The pussy is sold - and your ass is fat
But I asked my man and he said it wasn't all that
Right about the time you were shopping the demo
He tore your ass up in the back of a limo
And you didn't even care
You left your mom in Schlobohm - on what WELFARE
Bitch you know you ain't right
Matter fact what are you doing at about 8 o'clock tonight
You got the boots and I'm coming to get 'em
Is it true that after you fuck 'em, you'll make a record with him
If so then I'll be there and it won't be hard to find me
Cause like I said before Mary J - You Remind Me!
