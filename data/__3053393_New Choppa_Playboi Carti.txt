I roll up an L in the lobby
My partner's got wops and it's probably a Glock or a Tommy
From H to the E double hockey sticks
Keep a choppa, chop you if you try me, bitch
Let's see who next on my homi' list
Carti like, "Rocky, you bodied this"
That's my prerogative
Shit on them, that's on my potty list
Accused of being bougie by a snobby bitch
Cops want to ID us
Hope they as fast as my Adidas
She say I'm special, that's obvious
Rich 'cause my ideas
Run up the racks
"For the most part I rap," when they ask what my hobby is
Run it up, not one of them
Rich as fuck, I'm a hundred up
Swipe, swipe, like I'm on a bus
It's A$AP and I ain't one to rush

Run it up, run it up, run it up (Yeah)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, mm-hmm, yeah, yeah)
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa (Yeah)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, mm-hmm, yeah, yeah)
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I ain't hearing what you say
(New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa)
I ain't listening to what you say
(Run it up, run it up, run it up)
Get the fuck up out the way
(New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa)
Go on, let a player play
(Run it up)
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa (Run it up, run it up)
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa (What? Chop, bitch)
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
(New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa)72Embed
