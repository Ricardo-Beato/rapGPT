8 ContributorsI Got It On Me Lyrics
In all honesty, let me speak the truth
They ain't nothing in real street niggas
You know real trap niggas want more for Christmas
That's some new Gucci Mane nigga

You heard I got long paper, I got it on me
Yeah my money long baby, I got it on me
We can get along baby cause I got it on me
You heard my money long baby, yeah I got it on me

 trigger on the nine, I'm about to sneeze
Fast booger in my nose, I'm about to squeeze
Gun to the boy head, he on his knees
Ran off with 30 bands, 25 p's
What the fuck you pussy's thinking pulling moves like me
Then you try to put it on me, when you, you not me
Changing lanes without a signal causes car crashes
Bull with my chopper, for you slaves y'all get 30 lashes
Street niggas get it off with the hard or the soft
Turn my dick from hard to soft, insert it in her mouth
That's yo girlfriend on them xans, man that's that Memphis shit
Talk a bitch out a couple grams, that's that pimping shit
You might also like
You heard I got long paper, I got it on me
Yeah my money long baby, I got it on me
We can get along baby cause I got it on me
You heard my money long baby, yeah I got it on me

Let's see right about now
We present to the hood, the streets, the traps, the projects
East Atlanta Santa volume 2 nigga
East Atlanta Santa, the motherfucking sequel
The night GuWop stole Christmas

You heard I got long paper, I got it on me
Yeah my money long baby, I got it on me
We can get along baby cause I got it on me
You heard my money long baby, yeah I got it on me1Embed
