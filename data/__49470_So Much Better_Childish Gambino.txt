31 ContributorsSo Much Better Lyrics
I’m cooler than an ice cube, yeah, I’m rude
‘Bout to get your head sliced, yeah, I’m nice
And you ‘bout to pay the price
Like The Price Is Right, but I’m not Bob Barker
Yes, I get down like I’m Charlie Parker
Meaning that I’m musically inclined
If you try to get with mine, I’m about to blow yo head back
Get another bullet and I spray bullet (bullet)
And I spray back, pop, pop, click, click (drop, drop) down
Now they lookin’ for your body like all over the town
Niggas, my name Gambini, I used to be clean
Now I’m dirty martini, ‘cause this boy met world like Feeny
These niggas make wishes like genie

Nigga you know how we do
Latinos, black people, and gringos
This money stained my fingers like Cheetos
Blast it out your speakers like credo
‘Cause I can barely hold it all in like Speedos
These niggas got a lot of nerve
These niggas got a lot of sneaks
And all these skinny bitches busy shop at Anthropologie
Who you tryin’ to be?
I’mma take my girls to BIM and treat ‘em like a VIP
Because I am a G, ugh (G, ugh)
I start the party like Chex Mix
Put it in your house like Netflix
Beef, nigga, it’s what’s for breakfast
Y’all niggas got beef with this kid
Y’all niggas’ punks and stay punks like the Misfits
I'm way off in the distance
Y’all done lost the race like McCain
But like McCain, you used to be cool but now you lame
It’s hard to maintain ain’t it?
Because I am so much better (than before)
You might also like
My swag is so sick, you might catch it
I’m tired of fuckin’ ‘round with little kids like I’m Brad Pitt
These little kids need to play in traffic
‘Cause all they words make a nigga giggle like Mad Libs
I’m hot like an attic in the summer
And girls scream “Sick Boi” like we know each other
But we don’t know each other, you ain’t my fucking brother
We need to separate like organic peanut butter
My lightsaber flashing, my kneecaps ashy
And girls of the world used to walk right past me
Now I hang with girls like my girl Kate Perry
I might have to marry Kate like my name Ashley
These rappers don’t know what they up against
They can’t see a nigga like my names Snuffleupagus
If you don’t like my shit, why the fuck you bumpin’ this?
I am so much better (than before)
You better get it clean good ‘cause this the last straw
And break inside your house and leave your gas on
Nigga, we NASA, ‘cause we ‘bout to blast off
Go in the bathroom, we see you peein’ like I’m Shasta McNasty
Get it? UPN? Shasta McNasty?
Nigga, I’m a master
And I’m fucking plastered
I don’t need a fucking beat for this, I can make my shit up
While I go here’s the part that I’m about to show ya
I’m the best ‘cause I gotta
The devil wears Prada
And he’s got a boom boom like Welcome Back, Kotter
Leave your guy like Madonna
Got cheese like frittata, green ensalada
Got ya, mama
Most rappers want the drama, but I don’t want the drama
I just want a quiet night down at Benihana
I rap ‘cause I gotta
Dude’s got nada
I make ‘em all proud like my middle name ObamaEmbed
