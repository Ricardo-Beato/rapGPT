79 ContributorsPull Up Lyrics
That's how I raised 'em, Lord
Them niggas crazy

D-boy, D-boy, D-boy
My pockets look Keloid
My dead Presidents reborn
When I'm naked, I got three arms
Got a big house with a green lawn
Got a cigar full of neon
Like my ho cold and my tea warm
Close his casket, he look deformed
I got bitches on my dick

I got Jays at my door
I got shooters on my team
I got Feds down my throat
Counting money, dirty and clean
Smoking nothing but Irene
Got a bitch with good hygiene
I'm sick with it, no vaccine

I got coke under my nails
I got niggas taking them Ls
Nigga, we don't need no scale
I'm sick with it, no get well
Trigga man, trigga man, trigga man, please don't shoot
'Bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it like T-R-U
Young nigga ridin' in a V-1-2
Chop bricks like karate, judo, kung fu
Like jiu-jitsu, split a brick in two
You might also like
You do you, I'ma do what it do
Niggas dropping dimes and their 2 cents too
Bout it, bout it, bout it like hoody-hoo
Started from the bottom and I grew into
Everything I'm driving is new, improved
When she fucking with me, it's a new experience
Fucking with you it's a new excuse

Nigga, who is you?
I looked in the mirror, say "Ooh, it's you"
All my goons be too enthused
So don't open your mouth like you're chewing glue
Light blue Michael Jordans, my shoe get checks like "Swoosh"
Hear you niggas talking about what you gon' do or might do
I invite you, I entice you, but I advise you not to
God bless you like "Achoo"
Police find you in the bayou
With your friends by you and your shit knocked loose
Nigga, that's what you'll get like Ken and Ryu
I been Piru, I'm in my mood
So you know what you can do?

Fuck nigga, pull up
I'll be waiting, yeah
Fuck nigga, good luck, yeah
I'll be waiting, yeah
Fuck nigga, pull up
Fuck nigga pull up, fuck nigga pull up
I'll be waiting with my muhfuckin' foot up
I ain't even stood up, fuck nigga, good luck
Fuck nigga, put up or muhfuckin' shush up
Fuck nigga, pull up, my young niggas stood up
Like, fuck nigga, what up? Fuck nigga shook up
I been out here since P had the hook up
So if you wanna meet, nigga, I'm a butcher
If you wanna beef, nigga, I'm a butcher
My niggas wanna eat? Nigga, I'mma cook ya
If you with your bitch, and your bitch want me
Nigga, I'ma pull her like a trigger, she the bullet
We the illest, we the coolest (We the illest, we the coolest)
We the illest, we the coolest (We the illest, we the coolest)
The sickest and the smoothest, the gifted and the goofiest
Read a scripture out your movie, get a picture, I'm a-zoomin
I'ma hit 'em, I'ma lose 'em, I'ma kill 'em, I'ma bruise 'em
I'm a sinner, I'm a suitor, not to mention I'm a mover
I come at you when I'm movin', the bitch I'm with bad
I'ma pinch her on her booty, that bitch is Lil Tunechi's
Aw yeah, aw yeah, fuckin' right

Always had my gun in fights
Always had the upper hand
You the always-call-your-brother type (Ooh)
Hard head all my fuckin' life (Yeah)
Whole world in my fuckin' hand (Yeah)
Damn, my girl just pulled up
With "Pull Up to My Bumper" playin'
But fuck it man, like what you sayin'?
Look, I'm not sayin', but I'm just sayin'
Fuck nigga, pull up
I'll be waitin'
Lord knows, I'll be waitin' for you
Me and my young niggas
That's how I raised 'em

Fuck nigga, pull up, my young niggas stood up
Like, fuck nigga, what up? Blooka-blooka-blookah
I say, fuck nigga, pull up, I'm waitin' with my foot up
Fuck nigga, good luck (Blrrt, blrrt, blrrt)

I say, fuck nigga, pull up, fuck around and never pull off
They see the guns we pull out, say "Never mind" and pull off
They see the guns we pull out, say "Never mind" and keep goin'
I put the gun in his mouth and say "Be quiet and breathe soft"
Shifty eyes, I see four, flip them pies like D. Dawes
These bitches tired, they sleepwalk
Brilliant mind, I'm street smart, in deep thought
And we are what she want
And she want and he don't
But keep on and we gon' see (Yeah)

Fuck nigga, pull up
Yeah, fuck nigga, pull up, woo
I'll be waiting, haha
Why you waiting?
Fuck nigga, pull up, fuck nigga, pull up
Fuck nigga, pull up
Yeah, I'll be waiting for you
Uh, me and my young niggas, yeah
That's how I raised 'em Lord
Them lil niggas crazy
They just waiting for me to tell 'em to go crazy, boy
What am I waiting for?34Embed
