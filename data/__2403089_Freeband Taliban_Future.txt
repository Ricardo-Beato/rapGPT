Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands (Yeah)
Foreign whips, it cost me 'bout a couple grand (All foreign)
Foreign bitches, only tell 'em bring a friend (Let's go)
Hundred deep, FBG fucking Taliban (Yeah)
Love getting this money (Freebandz)
Bad bitches up on me (Yeah)
Know a nigga be stuntin' (Stuntin')
Money keep on coming (Count up)

That dirty money like diddy
My bad bitches, they pretty
My chains will leave you dizzy
I'm staying up on my grizzy
I'm stacking money like 50
I'm more Versace than Biggie
I'm poppin' bands like Diggy
My name could be Future Simmons
I'm most requested in clubs
I'm making girls fall in love
I'm poppin' bottles of bub
If I make it rain it's gon' flood
If I make it rain it's gon' thunder
I'm balling like Oklahoma
I'm chasing after them commas
You got Benjamins, then I want 'em
You got Franklins, then I need 'em
That  girl is a diva
I might just have to freeze her
She gon' pledge her allegiance
To Freeband Gang she believe in
Making movies like Steven
A foreign bitch from New Zealand
Her friend don’t even speak English!

Hundred deep, FBG fucking Taliban (Yeah)

Bad bitches up on me (Yeah)
Know a nigga be stuntin' (Stuntin')
Money keep on coming (Count up)

Got that money flipping like a cartwheel
Bitch, tell me how that foreign car feel
Smoking purp it got the whole car filled
So much money, why the fuck I rap still?
Money all in my pocket, rubber bands keep poppin'
Thinking hustle, hustle, hustle
Like, "Naw nigga I ain't stoppin'"
See my jug phone, it keep boomin'
Drop top and I'm coolin', I'm foolin'
Now a nigga out here doing what we doing
See these young niggas is poppin' now
Pluto we ain't coming down
Naw we ain't coming down
Scooter say it's all about the cash money
Stripper bitches love shaking ass for me
Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands (Yeah)
Foreign whips, it cost me 'bout a couple grand (All foreign)
Foreign bitches, only tell 'em bring a friend (Let's go)
Hundred deep, FBG fucking Taliban (Yeah)
Love getting this money (Freebandz)
Bad bitches up on me (Yeah)
Know a nigga be stuntin' (Stuntin')
Money keep on coming (Count up)

I'm strapped up, Don Cannon
My pack, it just landed
I remix it, pack it up
Then I put it back in the bandage
I'm Super Future, I'm jammin'
The roof is panoramic
The coupe got brain damage
I'm a Freeband Gang bandit
I'm gnarly, and I'm wavy
Salute me, I'm going crazy
I get blowed until I'm faded
I trap until they raid it
I hustle – I ain't made it
I'm scorching, on fire, blazing
Black girls and Caucasians
Dominicans and Asians
You wish you were this fresh
You see how I'm dressed
Got a foreign bitch on deck
She know I got that check
Dirty money, keep that shit in rubber bands (Yeah)
Foreign whips, it cost me 'bout a couple grand (All foreign)
Foreign bitches, only tell 'em bring a friend (Let's go)
Hundred deep, FBG fucking Taliban (Yeah)
Love getting this money (Freebandz)
Bad bitches up on me (Yeah)
Know a nigga be stuntin' (Stuntin')
Money keep on coming (Count up)Embed
