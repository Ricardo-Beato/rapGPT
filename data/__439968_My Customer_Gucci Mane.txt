11 ContributorsMy Customer Lyrics
R-I-P to Michael Jackson
Live at the brick factory
Moonwalk, Screwop
Guwop

Your baby daddy buy this shit from me (He my customer)
Your old lady come and get shit free (She my customer)
You know I sell a fifty pack a week (I love my customers)
Shop with me you know I got shit for cheap (I love my customers)
You my customer, damn she my customer
He my customer, damn they my customers
Daddy a hustler, momma raised a hustler
To you, your baby brother
To me, just a customer

Gucci Man, I'm coming through customs and bails, I'm bustin' 'em
Shoutout to my momma, I love her, I got my money up
Niggas, they be hating, they be discussing us when your money up
How you figure Gucci Mane owe you man you ain't front me none
Gucci Man, I take a problem, you just a customer
Niggas never thought we would make it, man they didn't fuck with us
Juice man tote a bag of problems, apartment full of baby bottles
AK peekin' out the blinds, it's like we playin' cops and robbers
But fuck the coppers and fuck the robbers
It's Big Guwop, your pusha man, I solve your problem
Look out on the roof, lookin' at you with binoculars
Arachnophobia, four drop spiders Guwop got options
You might also like
Your baby daddy buy this shit from me (He my customer)
Your old lady come and get shit free (She my customer)
You know I sell a fifty pack a week (I love my customers)
Shop with me you know I got shit for cheap (I love my customers)
You my customer, damn she my customer
He my customer, damn they my customers
Daddy a hustler, momma raised a hustler
To you, your baby brother
To me, just a customer

Fresh you hanging with a young nigga 
Got bong off in my drawers ain't leavin' 'til ain't nothin' left
 man and how the hell this bitch gon' sell?
Man the block its hot as hell
Man I'm servin' clientele
Waist down, 39 shells, pull up get it detailed
Fish scale got my phone ringing
And you know my neck blinging
All these bitches on me feindin'
Talking money, they on my penis
Buying rolly street money
Worldwide, nigga we eatin'

Your baby daddy buy this shit from me (He my customer)
Your old lady come and get shit free (She my customer)
You know I sell a fifty pack a week (I love my customers)
Shop with me you know I got shit for cheap (I love my customers)
You my customer, damn she my customer
He my customer, damn they my customers
Daddy a hustler, momma raised a hustler
To you, your baby brother
To me, just a customer
I got it on my own, uncle got it out the bowl
Pots and stove for the low
You know everything must go,  and hoes
The truck gone roll, it's outta control
Everything is served
Thumbing through it, steady making plays while I'm sippin' syrup
They dealin', they dealin', they dealin'
The Trap House is gonna make a killin'
Got money all under the mattress and hundreds, they all in the ceilin'
I'm fuckin' on all of these bitches
I make 'em do all of my business
I make 'em make all of my plays
I make 'em do all of my dealings

Your baby daddy buy this shit from me (He my customer)
Your old lady come and get shit free (She my customer)
You know I sell a fifty pack a week (I love my customers)
Shop with me you know I got shit for cheap (I love my customers)
You my customer, damn she my customer
He my customer, damn they my customers
Daddy a hustler, momma raised a hustler
To you, your baby brother
To me, just a customer2Embed
