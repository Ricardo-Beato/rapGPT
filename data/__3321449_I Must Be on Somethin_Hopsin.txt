I must be on somethin'
Lately I been actin' kinda cuckoo
Momma said I got a screw or two loose
I must be on somethin'
The doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood
I ain't just been feelin' like I used to
I must be on somethin'
I been lost and ain't nobody found me
To be honest it ain't safe to be around me
I must be on somethin'
This shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones
Fuck it, man, Lord knows
I must be on somethin'

Shit, lately my logic's been so irrational
Violence is laughable
What's the antidote? I don't have control
I need a chaperone when I'm back at home in a padded zone
'Cause I've been known to speak in a savage tone and slap a ho
Do I even have a soul?
My thoughts are so unimaginable
My brain just hasn't grown
Since I climbed through my momma's vaginal
And I been asked to go to a shrink, it ain't gon' happen, bro
Suck a dick and swallow a massive load!
Bitch, I can explode at any moment
Don't get me goin', 'cause a lot can happen
You talkin' crap and wake up in a fuckin' Saw contraption
A raw assassin, you see me you better be haulin' ass then
Your gashes cannot be treated with Tylenol or Aspirin
No cotton swab or napkin can clean the mess up
It's me and my alter ego against the world, it's just us
Ain't no one who textin' my cellular phone except sluts
It's clear there's a problem with me, so guess what?
You might also like
I must be on somethin'
Lately I been actin' kinda cuckoo
Momma said I got a screw or two loose
I must be on somethin'
The doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood
I ain't just been feelin' like I used to
I must be on somethin'
I been lost and ain't nobody found me
To be honest it ain't safe to be around me
I must be on somethin'
This shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones
Fuck it, man, Lord knows
I must be on somethin'

The world has fucked me, it's time to get even now
They say I'm the one no one wants to be around
Guess it's my deceivin' smile
Guess it's because I been treatin' people foul
Makin' songs about 'em, talkin' shit and then freakin' out
This is how I handle all solutions
There's no false illusion
Fuck an evil witch, bitch, I'm the demon that's off the broom stick
Where's the fire? I'm walkin' through it
Y'all ain't got the balls to do it
I'm talkin' stupid, it's all inclusive
With my psychotic state, filled with a lot of hate
I'ma operate on my enemies
Chop 'em up and then drop 'em on pots and plates
I'm not to fuck with, so stop it, let's not debate
Usually never talkin' much 'cause I'm stuck in a awkward state
The pain I have's everlastin'
Won't be surprised when I'm left in ashes from my hellish habits
The hell is happenin'?
The condition I'm in is probably worse than you can imagine
Make sure you say this shit to whoever's askin'
He must be on somethin'
Lately I been actin' kinda cuckoo
Momma said I got a screw or two loose
I must be on somethin'
The doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood
I ain't just been feelin' like I used to
I must be on somethin'
I been lost and ain't nobody found me
To be honest it ain't safe to be around me
I must be on somethin'
This shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones
Fuck it, man, Lord knows
I must be on somethin'5Embed
