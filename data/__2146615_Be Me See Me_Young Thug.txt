Got me a check and went brazy (Brazy)
I swear I done got me a check and went brazy (Brazy)
All these lil' niggas too lazy (Lazy)
They don't want no check then they act like some babies (Baby)
Homicide, homicide, homicide (Baby)
Pull up to the block and kill your old lady (Lady)
I'm traumatized-traumatized (Baby)
This shit right here can't be televised nigga no way
(Baby, Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)
Bro gave me control, bro gave me control (He-eyy)
Bro gave me control (Yeah, yeah), bro let me control it (He-eyy)
Yeah, control it, brother let me control it (He-eyy), yeah (Sheesh!)

How can I be from the A when I'm in love with a K?
(Love with a what?)
You can't just jump in the game
Slow yo ass down, nigga, wait (Slow it, slow it)
You chuck up 3500, 127 of them on the way (Skrt, skrt)
Check my status, I'm a fly nigga
Clearport, them Tahoes await us (Yeah, yeah)
They waiting on the Thugga (What?)
They waiting on my brother
They wait on my mother (And what?)
They suck me like suckers (Sheesh)
I swear I ride them like camels (Sheesh)
I ride with bananas (Juul)
I smoke Hannah Tana, got animal manners
My spot having cameras (Yah), I meant having bameras
Grabbing my cup, I don't give a fuck I'm serving the cops (Ooh)
Looking, smelling like a bird on the block (Ooh)
Thugger pitch a nigga curve with the rock (Ooh, ooh)
Unfoonk greet him with a lock in the sock (Yeah, yeah)
I might rob Jack when he come out the box (Yeah, yeah)
Suck it or not (Suck it, suck it)
