27 ContributorsWhat You Want Lyrics
Nunca cre√≠ que esto iba pasar
Eres lo mejor que me ha pasado
Te quiero tanto

Take some time, do it slow (Tell me what you want)
It's about that time ('Bout that time), girl you know it (Tell me what you want)
I know you are my girl (Tell me what you want)
Why act like you don't want it girl? (Tell me what you want)

Baby girl when it comes to women, I've been around the block a couple of times
But you're the only shorty that's running circles in my mind
And in this day and age that we live in, and it's all defined
Why you so intellectual? Why you so damn fine, now
Hey girl, hey girl yeah I'm trying to get it
Stop with all these games and tell me what up with it
Just take my hand, I'll be your man
We surrounded by infidelity in this world that we live in
But I promise I'll never give in, that's a given
I'm living for you and none other
Just a brother trying to find a lover to cherish until he perish
With honeymoons on the stars and vacations in Paris
Don't be embarrassed if you get addicted to these kind of things
It's the finer things, fuck the haters and what the drama brings
It ain't nada, I supply the Prada and diamond rings
Just as long as your heart sings, so
You might also like
Take some time (Take some time), do it slow (Do it slow) (Tell me what you want)
It's about that time ('Bout that time), girl you know it (Girl you know it) (Tell me what you want)
I know you are my girl (Tell me what you want)
Why act like you don't want it girl? (Tell me what you want)

Uh, yeah
And now we back at it, shorty pussy like a drug
And she got me cornered like a crack addict
Got my mind racing, era-dict
Better yet it's erotic
You want it? I got it
Look at what you started, way she work it when she on top
I might as well applaud it
Lord have mercy I'm trying to get it
Rip it and split it, hell yeah you know I did it
Converse then lay you down like a verse, I'm trying to hit it
Baby I want it, always down to keep it a hunnid
With you my feet are never on the ground, no way I'ma plummet
Headed to the summit, so tell me are you really 'bout it?
I never doubt it, you're the one that I need
Apart from you my emotions begin to recede
You're everything that I have wanted and all that I need
So shorty tell me how you feelin', worth feelin', looks killin'
I need it, I'm not tryna beat it and delete it
I'm trying to build, and let you know that everything we share is real, so
Take some time (Take some time), do it slow (Do it slow) (Tell me what you want)
It's about that time ('Bout that time), girl you know it (Girl you know it) (Tell me what you want)
I know you are my girl (Tell me what you want)
Why act like you don't want it girl? (Tell me what you want)10Embed
