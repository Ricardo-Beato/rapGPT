I'm so close, I can taste it
The man on the moon keep playin'
Practical jokes, plantin' the mirrors and smoke that I fade away in
You be complainin', and I can't explain it, I guess
Nothin' compare to the feelin', the feelin' amazin'
Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy

And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', show me somethin'
And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', somethin' I can see

Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop, so hold on, but
That's just the way it goes, your god don't wait for no one
And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go, but look at where you came from
You might also like
And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', show me somethin'
And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', somethin' I can see25Embed
