35 ContributorsIntro (Shaolin Finger Jab)/Chamber Music Lyrics
I must tell you that the Clan is a danger to the public
But still for many men just to hear of the name
Fills them with hate and loathing
But why? They've never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did
*beat drops*
In the past there's something that they would like to forgive
First, I'll tell you about their style, planned techniques
The main style
"Shaolin Finger Jab!"
Yo..
*sounds of fighting*
(Uh-huh)
We are watchin' your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock, all we need is your orders to move
Met a lot of crosses last night
Young and old!
You been busy here
I respect that!
Yeah, (Ayo), yeah
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in (Yo)
Come on! You know what it is
(Thou must bust shots all the time, kid)
(Ayo, ayo, ayo) We're back!

Peep The Jump Off, ain't nothin' sweet, get dumped off
Frontin like you won't get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son, master guns that'll run up in plastic ones
And then go, crash in the slums
One tight army, few good men that'll rep
Invade you strongly, Prince of Wales swimmin' on feet
Props'll sell, all yellow L's, cops sleepin' on nails
Niggas get realer than real, yo
Flash the brown, last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge, Wu kicks, movin' them pounds, yo
Last on niggas, great adventures of my niggas
And Castro pictures, sendin' a rash out the kitchens
Like the wind, invite the grin, watch niggas rewrite the trend
Wu niggas did it again, yo
Unhighly, octane, die cast metal frame
Lame, let another man with heat handle beef

Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in

Yo, spark the intro, relevant info
Load up the keyboard, 105 tempo
Most heated battles, I've blasted MCs
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level where we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal, eight calculate position
The world snapped, once we combined our rap
Drastic measures, priceless treasures on Nap'
Our swords swing, windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks, off the project bricks
It's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed
It's like the shot on the dock of the bay
That slayed Otis, the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP, a hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on the fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance, encouragement
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in

It be the Lost Tribe, 7 days locked in the dungeon
Foamin' at the mouth, mad dog in this production
The uncontrolled substance got me spittin' up bars disgustin'
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin'
On Judgement Day runnin' through Hell, yellin' and cussin'
At MC's in my circumference, y'all niggas hand-cuffin'
These hoes and ain't read them they rights or nothin'
Keep lustin', yeah and I'ma a keep hustlin'
With Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
You know me, every time you kiss that ho you blow me
You blow trial trying to walk a mile in my Sauconys

Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
We just touched down, Wu shuttle, private jet
Stepped off the plane, the world wept
Roll with the Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural, rock with the Beatles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wiz's scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious
Bless mic pure deafness, awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain, hail, snow to the earthquake

Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin' the party up-in

You've been busy
Are you mastered?
You've been busy
Are you mastered?
You've been busy
Are you mastered?
You've been busy here..1Embed
