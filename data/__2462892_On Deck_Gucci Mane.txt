Good kush burner nigga in the kitchen, good cookin
And I know I might be ugly, but my car is good lookin
A star, so I shine like the sun in Mississippi
A show in Mississippi, so I love to sit with fifty, bands
Ya gamblin ass I'm from Birmingham
Shot ya boy down fifty grand and I shook lil buddy hand
Until the feds get me nigga spend ya bread with me (Huh)
You pretty boy niggas know the kid get filthy, fizzy
Haters know the bitch stay distant
Get ya ass whooped, bus came, you just missed it (Huh)
So Icey boys four niggas eight bitches
Two girls for every nigga that's how we kick it (Yeah)

Got them shooters on deck, we got goons on deck
Big jewels on deck, baby we on deck

It's a pity how these inner city bitches fuck these niggas just for riches
Flashing like they rich but shop at JC Penny's
A gimme u say gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme

So Icey boys baby got it on my necklace on my neck and on my wrist
On my face because I'm flexin
I'm a chef I can make a hit, I can make a brick
Used to steal rob and take a brick I didn't fake a bit
If a bitch talk bout Gucci mane that she on Gucci dick
I'm a soldier and a CEO, So Icy we da shit
If a bitch talk bout So Icey she on our dick
I'm a soldier and a CEO So Icey we the shit
Is you iced out? (check) Is you thugged out? (check)
Got them shooters on deck, got them goons on deck
So Icy Entertainment, big jewels on deck
Baby look at our neck, we rock VVS
Is you iced out? (check) Is you thugged out? (check)
Got them shooters on deck, we got goons on deck
Big jewels on deck, baby we on deck
