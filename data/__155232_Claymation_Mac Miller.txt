61 ContributorsClaymation Lyrics
Uh, bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid picture

Fresh off a steroid swisher
Pistol at the peephole, that's a paranoid nigga
One of a kind though, ain't nobody close to me
Your ass is straight over D, I'll bag it like groceries
It's whatever though, whatever cross my mind
Haters got no watch, I ain't got the time
Vinny got more flow than a box of wine
Rare as a copper dime, I got an awkward mind
But it's beautiful like Russel Crowe
Fire at the fingertips, can't extinguish it
Shorty gave me tight head without shrinkin' it
Coolest kid out, on my Chuck Inglish shit
Mac and Vinny always get the people loose
Fall back, strike back, just like evil do
The birds prey on us like eagles do
It's like claymation the way they bend and move
You might also like
Uh, bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though? (Yeah)
I'ma be a ghost (Yeah), take a Polaroid picture
Monster and Michael Keaton, I'm offin' you while you sleepin'
You talkin' but it's so cheap and I'm popular for a reason
I got a pool but it's sharks swimmin' in the deep end
Don't get much sleep, two minutes to get a dream in
Is all you need, it's crazy
The colony was lost at sea gettin' wavy
The rawest rapper, baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn, I'm sendin' shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me, this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope, we holier than all of Jesus' kids
But we speakin' to heathens and all of these Even Stevens
Who don't need a reason, just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleepin', cheeba gon' keep me dreamin', I'm faded
Been in Cali a lil' too long, it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm Instagrammin' camera-shy Samurais
Fuckin' up a Jerm beat, teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom rides
My pockets fat, I'm still lookin' for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime
Girl, you could come a little closer, put your hand in mine
This life a prison, it's time to set you free
Watchin' movies in silence, describin' what I see
Uh, bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Bitches stay hatin', this is claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid picture11Embed
