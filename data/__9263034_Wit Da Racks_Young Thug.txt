(Wheezy outta here)

Yeah, yeah, I'm in this bitch, yeah, I'm back (Ah, ah)
I hit the club on the up, he can come with the racks (Uh, come with it, yeah)
Float 'round the town with a sack (Woo, ha, ayy)
You snatchin' my chain, I bet you I get that shit back (Ha, grrah)
Hey, I pull up and finger her cat (Woo)
I'm a big dawg, hit the store, get to blowin' them racks (Ha, brr, just racks)
I'm in a golf cart rockin' Spider like that
Nigga rich as fuck, I don't know where he was at (Woah)
Ran a doggy train and I didn't have a track (Woah, hey, hey)

I say what I mean and I don't take it back
With the waterfall on my wrist and my neck
I ain't goin' soft, not a pimp in distress
I'm a sex symbol, bitches love me to death
Since Novеmber, I've been buyin' the stuff
I don't do no rеntin', I've been keepin' it tough
She got four feelings, that's the coupe and the truck
Shorty trippin', I ain't do nothin' to her (Woo)
All I did was turn up more women
She know I'm Jordan and Scottie Pippen (Yeah)
Every album got no skippin' (Ha)
Shorty bad, ain't have no chicken (Why?)
Suburban, her toe pretty (Ayy)
You a nerd, I uphold the city (Yeah)
Ain't no way and I told 'em to hit it (Skrrt)
You get lost, hope you know the city
Better not get caught in the wrong trenches (Haha)
What's on your wrist, million?
Next week, it might be a zillion (Woo)
Kanye let me borrow a billion
Mediterranean by a village (Woo)
I'm surrounded by cocktails and beautiful women to kick it with (Woo)

Yeah, yeah, I'm in this bitch, yeah, I'm back (Ah, slatt)
I hit the club on the up, he can come with the racks (Uh, come with it, yeah)
Float 'round the town with a sack (Woo, ha, ayy)

I took her shoppin' in Soho (21)
I leased her, nigga, this your ho (21)
Snatchin' my chain is a no-no (21)
Get your ass shot from the logo (21)
I put an opp in a chokehold (Pussy)
They snitchin' and broke, po-po (Pussy)
Give me a quickie, she go-go (Pussy)
'Cause I'm in a rush, JoJo (On God)
Okay, buy a car and buy another one (Yeah)
Way too many, gave my brother one (Yeah)
Send a blitz, we huddlin' (Yeah)
When it's smoke they stutterin' (Yeah)
Switch on a Glock, strike a pose
I'm a cameraman, it's shutterin' (21)
Nosy niggas, we buttin' in (21)
Bend it over, let me see somethin'
Young FL Studio from the back, I'm tryna beat somethin'
I'm the type to put my boots on, he the type to run and go tweet somethin'
I don't play about my hard drive, get your ass whooped if you leak somethin'
Niggas always tryna sneak somethin' (Ah, 21, 21, 21)
Went to Bleveland Ave, had the scoop with the camp (Ha)
I know mama Thug livin' richer than friends
You know Dolly, Doraah from the block, they the best
I got two twins in the back of the truck
Ass fat like fifteens, in the back of the truck
I took two twos, put it right in the cuff
Like the other twelve 'cause we don't fuck with her (Woo)
Spot jumpin' and you know that it's hittin' (Let's go)
Soft skin like it's out a bikini
Took a rose right out a martini (Ah)
One balloon and I'm havin' her fiendin' (Ah)
To the roof, where we don't have a ceilin'
What the fuck? Tell me, what does that mean, then? (Yeah)
That mean I'm gee-ee-eeked (Oh)
Rollin', I can't feel my hands or my feet (Oh)
Got in some pension in the trillion, in the zillion (Yeah)
We might need quantum physics to count the rizzisks with the slizzies
UTOPIA, back to business

Yeah, I'm in this bitch, yeah, I'm back (Slatt, ah, woo)
I hit the club on the up, he can come with the racks (Uh, come with it, yeah)
Float 'round the town with a sack (Woo, ha, ayy)

Hey, I pull up and finger her cat (Woo)
I'm a big dawg, hit the store, get to blowin' them racks (Ha, brr, just racks)

Nigga rich as fuck, I don't know where he was at (Woah)
Ran a doggy train and I didn't have a track (Woah, Yak)
I've been that way since a lil' nigga (A lil')
Don't like it? Then deal with it
Huh, bool out and I'll chill with you (I'll chill with you)
It's YG and Spider, your favorite idol, your favorite rival (Slatt)
Maniac man, Yak with the MAC (MAC)
Might beat on your chest, lil' nigga, relax (Ha)
Tactical, yeah, I get radical, don't it?
