31 ContributorsBlurry Lyrics
(Sosa on the beat)
Ayy, Tadoe, that nigga sayin' he want what? He want what?
Call your phone and say who?
Man, I don't know what the fuck she want, man
That bitch got me fucked up
I ask grandma for fifty, she gave me a hundred
Shit, I brought her back some money, I was trappin' and shit
But I trapped with that shit, ayy
Gang
Damn Grandma, I can't get a hundred to fuck around with and get off the block?
Don't say nothin' when I get locked up now, shit
She ain't even wanna give me no hundred though
She gave to me though, she gave me fifty
Nah, I brought back a hundred, she gave me fifty
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Hahaha, ayy

Ask grandma for fifty (Grandma)
She gave me a hundred (A hundred)
I ran off with the money (Money, yoom)
Then brought back some money (Then brought back some money)
Smoking green dope (Dope)
Shit reekin' like fried onions (Shit reekin')
I take any money (Any money), foreign money or rap money
I be trappin', I ain't lackin', nigga, I ain't worried (I ain't lackin', I ain't worried)
I will let my gun blow, nigga, I ain't scared (Nigga, I ain't scared)
I'm a warrior with a thirty, nigga, I ain't Curry
Check out my watch, my diamonds, nigga, they ain't blurry (Nigga, they ain't blurry)
Blurry, blurry, blurry, blurry

I was in Wokcano's eatin' on some curry (Eatin' on some curry)
But wanting to hit thirty-four, bitch, that's Eddy Curry (Bang, bang, bang)
I'm still smokin' loud (Tooka), even though you hear me (You hear me)
Bitch, I'm in the field, White Sox, Paul Konerko (Paul Konerko)
Get my hittas on you, Ronald Belasario (Belasario)
Told that bitch that gave me head last night, nerdy hoe (Lil nerdy hoe)
Throwin' money in the club, I'm a pitcher, run yours up (Run yours up)
And I swear my watch a thot, it is a lil flirty hoe (Flirty hoe)
Pull up doin' hits, eating on some cereal (On some cereal)
White chocolate, white milk, red Cheerio's (Red Cheerio's)
Shoot the red guts out a nigga, red gun material (Bang, bang, skrrt, skrrt)
Bitch, I'm trappin' in my trap, dancin' like Lil TerRio (Skrrt, skrrt)
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

Ask grandma for fifty (Grandma)
She gave me a hundred (A hundred)
I ran off with the money (Money, yoom)
Then brought back some money (Then brought back some money)
Smoking green dope (Dope)
Shit reekin' like fried onions (Shit reekin')
I take any money (Any money), foreign money or rap money
I be trappin', I ain't lackin', nigga, I ain't worried (I ain't lackin', I ain't worried)
I will let my gun blow, nigga, I ain't scared (Nigga, I ain't scared)
I'm a warrior with a thirty, nigga, I ain't Curry
Check out my watch, my diamonds, nigga, they ain't blurry (Nigga, they ain't blurry)
Gang, gang
White 'Vette, pull up red interior (Skrrt, skrrt)
Engine too damn loud, I'm not hearin' ya (Ha, ha)
Four nickel on my hip, I'm not fearin' ya (Nah, nah)
Hollows hit your face, it's bacteria (Bop, bop, skrrt, skrrt)
Bitch, I'm trappin' out the Hemi, yuh (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Bitch, I'm trappin' with the semi tucked (Skrrt, skrrt, dududuh)
Got a thousand for a hundred pack, then pick it up (Ha, ha)
Nigga said can he be Glo, I'm not feeling ya (Nah, nah)
Bitch, I'm in the trap, I'm countin' all these silly bucks (Fff, beep)
Dirty money, but it keep me clean as fuck (Gang)
All this jewelry on got me blinging up (Bling, bling)
