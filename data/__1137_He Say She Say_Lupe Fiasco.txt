59 ContributorsHe Say She Say Lyrics
I can't, I won't, I can't
I won't let you
Leave
I don't know what you want
You want, want from
Me (Uh)

She said to him
"I want you to be a father, he's your little boy (Uh)
And you don't even bother, like
‘Brother' without the ‘R’, and he's startin' to harbor
Cool on food for thought, but for you, he's a starver
Startin' to use red markers on his work
His teacher said they know he's much smarter, but he's hurt
Used to hand his homework in first
Like he was the classroom starter," burst to tears
Let him know she's serious
"Now he's fightin' in class
Got a note last week that says he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us
'Cause you ain't never pick him up
You see what his problem is?
He don't know where his poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's makin' a hole; you've been diggin' it
'Cause you ain't been kickin' it since he was old enough to hold bottles
He wasn't supposed to get introduced to that (To that)
He don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't askin' you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny, but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart when I try to provide
And he say, 'Mommy, that ain't your job'
To be a man, I try to make him understand
That I'm his number-one fan, but it's like
You booin' from the stands, you know the world is out to get him
So why don't you give him a chance?" It's like
You might also like
I can't, I won't, I can't
I won't let you
Leave
Now, now
I don't know what you want
You want, want from
Me (What you want from
Me, oh-oh-oh)
Uh, so he said to him
"I want you to be a father, I'm your little boy (Uh)
And you don't even bother, like
‘Brother' without the ‘R’, and I'm startin' to harbor
Cool on food for thought, but for you, I'm a starver
Startin' to use red markers on my work
My teacher say they know I'm much smarter, but I'm hurt
I used to hand my homework in first
Like I was the classroom starter," burst to tears
Let him know he's serious
"Now I'm fightin' in class, got a note last week
That say I might not pass, kids ask me if my daddy
Is sick of us, 'cause you ain't never pick me up
You see what my problem is?
That I don't know where my poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's makin' a hole; you've been diggin' it
'Cause you ain't been kickin' it since I was old enough to hold bottles
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that (To that)
I don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't askin' you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny, but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart when my momma try to provide
And I tell her, 'That ain't your job'
To be a man, she try to make me understand
That she my number-one fan
But it's like you booin' from the stands, you know the world is out to get me
Why don't you gimme a chance?" It's like
I can't, I won't, I can't
I won't let you
Leave
Now, now
I don't know what you want
You want, want from
Me (What you want from
Me, oh-oh-oh) Ooh
I can't, I won't, I can't
I won't let you
Leave
Girl, I don't know why
You want, you want, want from
Me (No, no, no, oh-oh-oh)
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
I can't, I won't (I don't know what)
I can't, I won't (You want, what you want from me)
Let you leave (Oh, oh)
What you want from me
Oh, oh, oh, you want
You want, want from
