Under summers magic spell
But when autumn came her love did not remain
And made my world a living hell
I just lie awake and think of pleasant nights we'd spend
Under summers magic spell
But when autumn came her love did not remain
And made my world a living hell
I just lie awake and think of pleasant nights we'd spend
Under summers magic spell
But when autumn came her love did not remain
And made my world a living hellYou might also like6Embed
