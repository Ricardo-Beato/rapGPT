(Southside on the track, yeah)
Yeah, that's my buddy, buddy
What about (Metro)?

That's my buddy, buddy, drinkin' on the muddy
Pass it all off to the dogs, let 'em cut it
Make sure you let her experience her nutty
Put that dick all in her ribs and her gutty
Drinkin' Kid Cudi, actin' all slutty
In front company, Trayvon hoodie
Know it's all goodie
Don Juan pimpin', bitch, it's black tees, hoodies
Durag business

Lookin' all boogie, but savin' all your cookies
Act' to the right, red for the rookies
Ass on the right and on the left
Bunch of wealthy rich guys like ourselves, hey (Yeah, like ourselves, hey)

And you was supposed to call me back
But I'm glad you didn't 'cause I got busy
I just got a call, one of my brothers got whacked
It was time to ride, slid the sticks and the masks
You know if I pass, you won't get a call back and
I won't hit you back, you never could've imagined
Round of applause, you think you winnin' the battle
Mama say she look in my eyes, she see a casket
Daddy said he look in my eyes, he see a bastard
I look in his eyes and I see a future pastor
Funny niggas tryna be cool, you're an actor
No, I don't wanna lose, so I Casper
I was rockin' Jimmy Choos on my first tour
I still was thinkin' like a fool on my first tour
Now I'm on my worst tour
You might also like
That's my buddy, buddy, drinkin' on the muddy
Pass it all off to the dogs, let 'em cut it
Make sure you let her experience her nutty
Put that dick all in her ribs and her gutty
Drinkin' Kid Cudi, actin' all slutty
In front company, Trayvon hoodie
Know it's all goodie
Don Juan pimpin', bitch, it's black tees, hoodies
Durag business

Rich stepper, let's begin, I got a million on the coast
Thousand, bet a thousand, shoot it all, I'm bettin' on Cee-lo
Cash prize, let her cash it in, ain't left her with a note
Never bit, niggas, ain't never, ever (Never)
Palm Angel with the vibes, we like to swap out (We like to swap out)
Drop top, we pushin' P, she got her cock-eyed, cock-eyed
Sharin' bank rolls, they brung them props out (They brung them props out)
Ain't no switchin' sides, I'm with the guys 'til I pass out

Now they say they feelin' us (Yeah), but reality, they ain't as big as us (Nah)
Fuck her every night, I know for sure, she catchin' many nuts (Body count)
Cali Distro sendin' boxes through just like it's Pizza Hut (Phew)
Put it on, they eat it up (Eat it), flooded diamonds, my pieces up
Drop the top, you smell me in the wind
I been feelin' like a DJ when I tell 'em spin (Three sixty)
Ran up all these millions, so I went, copped ma that Benz (Skrrt)
Long live my fuckin' brother, that's my brodie, that's my twin (Keed, Keed)
That's my buddy, buddy, drinkin' on the muddy
Pass it all off to the dogs, let 'em cut it
Make sure you let her experience her nutty
Put that dick all in her ribs and her gutty
Drinkin' Kid Cudi, actin' all slutty
In front company, Trayvon hoodie
Know it's all goodie
Don Juan pimpin', bitch, it's black tees, hoodies
Durag business

Lookin' all boogie, but savin' all your cookies
Act' to the right, red for the rookies
Ass on the right and on the left
Bunch of wealthy rich guys like ourselves, hey
Like ourselves, heyEmbed
