24 ContributorsThe Left Lyrics
The left, the left
Leftie, hah

Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (Waah)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (It's Gucci)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)
Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (huh?)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (well damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (grrr)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)

God, please protect me if this shit go left
Cause I can cook a kilo by my God damn self
In the kitchen water whipping with the left
I don't know Redman, but I know who got the meth
I feel like I'm a one-man BMF
Cause I can lock a trap down by myself
You waiting on Gucci to go broke, then hold your breath
This shit ain't cut, it's raw, this shit gon' sell itself
But don't let your right-hand man know what your left hand doing
My homeboys called the cops on me and I ain't even tripping
But how you call yourself a G and hang around snitches?
These niggas going left like crazy, acting like bitches
You might also like
Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (Waah)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (It's Gucci)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)
Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (huh?)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (well damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (grrr)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)

Gucci Mane the leftie, pockets so hefty
Wrist so fucking rocky I can't even take a selfie
Right wrist glaring but my left hand glowing
Limping, kicking, pimping like my left leg broken
I offered her two thou, I tried to help her
She took too long to come, that's why I left her
I'm Gucci Mane, I eat millions for breakfast
I came back in a 'Rari like I left some
I'm in a drop top Rolls Royce I feel like I left some
I got like 50 thou on me, who wanna fuck some?
A lot of haters salty, they feel like I left 'em
But all the beefs that Gucci had, Gucci addressed them
Wop!

Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (Waah)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (It's Gucci)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)
Please don't make me slap you with the left, the left (huh?)
You a fake so I'm gon' dap you with the left, the left (well damn)
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, the left (grrr)
It's like I'm on an island by myself, the left (Wop)1Embed
