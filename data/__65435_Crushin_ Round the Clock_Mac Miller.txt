14 ContributorsCrushinâ€™ Round the Clock Lyrics
Uh
And all day, haha
Better hide your girl for this one (Crushin', crushin', crushin' round the clock)
Uh (Crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin', crushin' round the clock)

It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock (Look)

She got a little bit of beauty, little bit of class
Little bit of lips and a little bit of ass
Little bit of style, dressed to kill
Little bit of freak with a sex appeal
I'm so down for whatever, baby
Always dressed fresh and wavy
Wanna make love, ah yeah, that's gravy
Late night sex get extra crazy (Extra crazy)
Ain't gonna leave, I'm stayin'
Sick of all the games you playin'
Eye gazin', sex amazin', got you squintin', eyes look Asian
I know I'm just a kid, baby, tell me what this is
'Cause I seen you shake, I seen you moan every time I touch your lips (Aha)
You grab my hand, run your fingers through my hair
Everywhere we go the scent of sex all through the air
Yeah, I know you think I'm playin', right? (Playin' right)
How 'bout you just take a chance, stay the night? (Aha)
You my baby, right? Love it when I call you that
But I follow cash, I'ma have to call you back (Call you back)
Just know that, you be in my mind (My mind)
I say the same thing every single time
You might also like
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock

Yeah
I'm amazed, actin' like there ain't no time to waste (Waste)
She a freak, lemme get her right behind the stage (Aha)
My true shorty though (Uh-huh)
I've had all sorts of hoes (Sorts of hoes)
Take my time when I'm with her, drink my forty slow
Any given second, you can find us on the bed (Bed)
Wild sex, with her legs behind her head
Turn her over on her stomach, get it from the back (Back)
She always leave a scratch, but I like that
She the type that (Type that) you wanna wife that (Wife that)
And she like me 'cause all I do is pipe that (Aha)
Buzzin' like a bumblebee that's chillin' by the hive
Love her with no limits, 'cause my ceilin' is the sky
Feelin' up ya thighs, tongue ticklin' ya twine
When I get it from behind, you say it's twistin' up your spine (Aha)
Baby, I'm (I'm) one of a kind that finds that spot that have you climax
I'm that boy
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day (Ayy)
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock4Embed
