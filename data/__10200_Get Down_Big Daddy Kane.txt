7 ContributorsGet Down Lyrics
It ain't hard to tell
The flow of the Kane is movin em real well
I build and excel and plus I rap like hell
Lyrics generate, break through and penetrate
Connect like an interstate, now let me demonstrate
I grab the microphone and put the dap in quick
You start to tappin and snappin and clappin
Then rappin'll happen
And then I display, poetry, the right way
And rock the Gladys Knight to the next Morris Day
I get sexy like Marvin Gaye
And other times, I might wanna hit em hard and say
Somethin exquisite and clever like a wizard
Hit em like a blizzard if you missed it
Turn to your friend and say, "What is it?"
Or what was it, because it, was too fast for you to bust it
So pay attention to how the Smooth Operator does it
Just acknowledge the sound
Get on the good foot.. UHH, and get down

Look
The thought of competition, I don't have the faintest
Cause if I'm correct, I kicked them all in the anus
So I don't care if you step to me in three flocks
The men that's all pumped up like Reeboks
Cause I bring down the swelling, just like alcohol
Makin em all fall like the Berlin Wall
Then I apply pain just like a migraine
Pssssh, man, don't even try Kane
A lyrical catastrophe, a disaster see
Nobody gets on after me
Crushin MC's is how I get my joy
So when one tries to battle I'm like, hoo boy
Class in session as I give the lesson
To prove to another rapper that I rule in his profession
And it's nothin new, that the Kane is your ruler
Cause back in the days I used to call you Sundullah
Now it's a new time period, rappers are still fearin it
And the crowd is still cheerin
With the new Black Ceaser that came to town
With one purpose - to make you get down
You might also like
I start to flow, slow, and then ohh no
I gotta pick up the pace and go
Go relatin and statin what I'm creatin to straighten MC's
That I'm debatin terminatin as the Kane keeps them evadin
So step over, cause ain't no leftover
Remains from the Kane I drained the last brain
Speak like Oprah, attack like a cobra
Turn your whole year into a _Red October_
Lyrics are sweet like struddel, at the same time brutal
Your rhymes remind me of the noodle in umm
CHOP SUEY, soft and chewy
My rhymes are kickin like Bruce, you're just Hong Kong Fooey
So +Enter the Dragon+ as I start to raggin
All the competition that's on the bandwagon
I take the groove around around around around around
Around, so get down

Yo, get out your seat and jump to this
Throw your hands in the air and pump your fists
The name of the jam is get down so let me see you do it
And show some unity in music
We gotta show our young ones the right way
To avoid crucial poison and the price they might pay
So I keep on teachin the children to follow the
Power Equality, Allah C Equality, PEACE
