I'm the river that flow through the hood
Through the woods, through the 'burbs
Through the mud, through the bricks
Over the curb, to the forest reserve
Got with four acres and a forest of words
Plant and grown them, for the young seeds to know them
Trees is blowing, we see change in the wind
It's a new day and I got to take it in
See a black man run, we need him to win
Young eyes search, search for a better tomorrow
That belief lead the way and the angels follow
Open doors for the hopeful to go through
Cause I was chose to and I'm supposed to

I know that change gon' come
The race begun
We're almost there, oh yeah
I know that change gon' come
The race begun
We're almost there, oh yeah

I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child
Always smiled, let my mind float like a child
Wishing I was smart as these kids are now
All grown up still wishing I'm child, again
Church song reminded me to stay grateful
Omoye reminded me to stay playful
Days go by, my life on high
I lead on my wall so the fight don't die
In me, I found purpose why I emcee
Inspire a young world to be greater than me
I fall awake and I dream a song
So the little shorties will sing along
You might also like
I know that change gon' come
The race begun
We're almost there, oh yeah
I know that change gon' come
The race begun
We're almost there, oh yeah

Welcome children, welcome me
Your sentiments is felt in me
I see the future and the walk you have
Don't let these fools take you off your path
Laugh if you need to, smile if you need to
Life is a trip, ride along and proceed to
Drive to believe to do what you want to do
Remember your kings and queens are still humble too
Life is in front of you, no need to look back again
Victory can be claimed while you still battling
Travel along with the food I provide you
To awaken the voice that's inside you

I know that change gon' come
The race begun
We're almost there, oh yeah
I know that change gon' come
The race begun
We're almost there, oh yeah
Change is inevitable you can't stop it
Change is happening in everybody's life
Change is like a furious hurricane that you can't stop
What is change?
Change is Martin Luther King Jr.,
Ghandi, Shakespeare, Assata Shakur
Barack Obama
And you can't forget Common
Change is gonna happen
Change is hopeEmbed
