18 ContributorsCastle Made Of Sand Lyrics
Yeah
Let me crack open my High Life real quick (Big Jerm)
Product placement, haha
Uh, uh, let's go

Let's take it to the top now, to the top now, baby
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow, I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky
And if you sittin' down, please stand (Uh-huh)
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside in this castle made of sand (Look, uh)

Let me get a hand clap, I'ma make an entrance (What?)
Givin' y'all the lecture, then I'm takin' questions
My soul a sword, write a sentence, make a weapon
Swimmin' in the deep end, you bitches takin' lessons (Haha)
Then I hear you hatin' on the boy
Well, I ain't offended (Nah)
'Cause I'm the captain of the team and y'all play the benches (Uh-huh)
Still breakin' it down, to rollin' it up
Put an eighthy in the blunt, then I'm smokin' a Dutch
But talk hoes, know I stay with a few
But they replace like the lace in my shoe
So tell me, what a player to do
When bein' real don't appeal to the player in you (Uh-huh)
I've seen some whack cats fast track to the fame
To me, it sound like some clowns rappin' the same
And we, we all livin' for the same thing (Same thing)
Just to make it to the top and remain king (What?)
You might also like
Let's take it to the top now, to the top now, baby
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow, I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind (Find me on my grind)
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky (Hands in the sky)
And if you sittin' down, please stand (Sittin' down, please stand)
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside in this castle made of sand (One time, look, uh)

And you can't name a single youngin' with a flow like mine
Got bars like soap and I glow like shine
If you think that I'm whack, you might change your mind
'Cause I got them punchlines that stain like wine (Ha)
Let me take my time, collect my thoughts
Keep it fresh like shoes when they kept in the box (Uh-huh)
Connect all the dots, I'm fresh, so clean
Stay pinchin' myself 'cause I'm livin' in a dream (Livin' in a dream)
Believe, I ain't never gonna stop
Find a new spot, then I set up my shop (My shop)
When I drop, your wifey gon' cop that (Cop that)
And haters gettin' shaken out they jockstraps (Haha)
Some say I'm bringin' hip-hop back
While others say I'm all up on that pop-rap (Pop-rap)
Team captain, control the game
Goin' hard 'til every single person knows my name
Let's take it to the top now, to the top now, baby (What?)
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow, I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind (Ha)
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky (Your hands in the sky)
And if you sittin' down, please stand (Down, please stand)
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside in this castle made of sand (What? What?)

To the top now, to the top now, baby
Yeah
