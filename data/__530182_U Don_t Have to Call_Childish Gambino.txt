82 ContributorsU Donâ€™t Have to Call Lyrics
Gambino: Yeah, where'd you guys go?
Girls: To where, In Atlanta?
Strip Club Queen: When I used to live here, I was the strip club queen
Fam: Wait, wait, so what's up with Follies? Like lemme know
Strip Club Queen: Follies is my favorite strip club ever, in Atlanta
Gambino: Follies is the realest
Strip Club Queen: I swear to god-Follies is the realest, more-so because they have international bitches in there, you got bitches from Cambodia, you got bitches from fucking Italy, you got bitches from fucking Africa, you got bitches from...Kansas, you got bitches from everywhere in Follies

Situations will arise, in our lives
But you gotta be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys
I sacrificed, 'cause you could not sleep without it
Girl I, 'cause I loved you
You were my girl
See I, thought the world of you
But so you know
You don't have to call baby no
'Cause I'mma be alright tonight
You don't have to call baby no
I'mma be alright tonight
You might also like
I mean
I waited, and waited, and waited
For that phone call
And then I served you what she was asking for
Nah, you ain't gotta make that call now
Stone Mountain, yeah, you started running that thing after us

(Don't you ever go away)
We are very rare
(Please don't leave me girl)
10% of a foster home trying to Cinderella this shit
This melanin pit they placed us in and said get out
(I always knew baby)
No blueprint, hell's cruise ship
(You don't have to call, just text me)
Took him and her, who made him and her
Who made him and her who made her
Who ran away from the south at 14 pregnant
Who made her who came back to the south
Atlanta, Georgia who made me
Funny hairline, white name
Blonde dreads, African name , both of our parents
Original black hippies, so what?
(Deep inside, I'm deep inside your heart)
(Please don't call me girl)
Little 5 points to Avondale to Stone Crest
You out in Lithonia though
But fuck that, I'm a high class nigga
I catch you out at Lenox
Nah fuck that, I'm looking for hoes at Atlantic Station
Nah fuck that, I'm at South DeKalb Mall
Really in the parking lot, leaning on some broke niggas Camry
The pic you sent last night says you really with the shits
(You wanna go, you know where i am)
My leather passenger seat exhales
Wasn't ready for all that
'Cause it's not me
I mean who is right?
(I just wanna die, i just wanna die, inside of your love)
I'mma take you to Tongue & Groove
There's $20 to wear my hat inside
I give em $100 and tell em to pay forward for the niggas behind me
They playing Jeezy like that shit came out yesterday
Thug motivation, I was never a thug and they used to respect me for it
But now the game's fucked up and I gotta Michael Corleone these niggas
Quiet, confident, I talked to her
She came with you, but she left with me
And now she's in the passenger seat
So, where we going?
Just away (Away, away, away, away)
Which leaves you standing there thinking
You don't have to call, baby52Embed
