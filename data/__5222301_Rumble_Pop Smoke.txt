Grrt
Woo, woo, woo
092MLB (Opps know how I'm rockin', grrt)
I make a call and it's war, huh?
It's 09s to the Cloccs, man
Run up, get done up, nigga
Spin the block, nigga (Grrt)
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
09, 100 Cloccs, we really do this shit, nigga
What's up nigga? GDK, nigga (It's that 100 Cloccs shit, man)
We really do this, nigga
What's up, nigga? Spin the block, grrrt, GDK
(All I know is you better have your vest, all that gangsta shit I put it to test)

Step on the field, watch 'em crumble (Brr)
Talkin' for what but you ain't put no work (Pah, pah)
All that talk but you ain't wanna rumble (Grrt)
Knuckle up, or get put on a shirt (Bah, bah, bah)
Send shots, hit you and your uncle (Uncle, yeah, bah)
Talkin' for what but you ain't been the first (Grrt)
Sauce drip like I stepped in a puddle (Puddle, bah, bah)
Don't be fooled by these frames, get left in the dirt
Yeah, I'm not with the talkin' or linkin' shit, disrespect, nigga lit
I just stick to the breesh, lay low 'cause these niggas be ignorant (Brr)
Friday, I'm hittin' shit, where I'm parkin' my V's like this (Skrrt, skrrt)
Flatbush got me stuck on a bracelet (Precinct)
Tell the DA, "I ain't writing no statements" (Writing no statements)
Big boot, have you stuck in the pavement (Blah, blah)
Talkin' the books, have you wait for arraignment
Tellin' them lies, I can't give 'em the facts
Balmains keep a Nina attached
Big body where I'm packin' my MAC
Big 092 but I stay with a MAC
Spinned through my block, but you ain't do shit
Say you got chops, but you ain't shoot shit
Come to my block, we keep two grips
Call the real choppers, we spin in two whips
You might also like
Niggas talk, for what? (Grrrt)
They know, we bend blocks for sure, shoot what, shoot who?
Caught in the road, that pole give you two shots, who hot?
Don't give a fuck who block, free Clax, free Shots
Don't give a fuck who flock, get your hoe shot up (Bah, bah)

Certain niggas if you touch that'll get you brushed (Bah, bah)
I ain't talkin' no bluff, run up, try your luck (Skrrt)
Shooters in the club, ready to gun bust
You know what's up, keep my Drac' tucked ain't no runnin' up
Hundreds in the bag, you know how the Cloccs move
When I see an opp treesh, yeah, she scream, "Woo"
All my niggas on the road, tryna eat food
Cookin up couple tracks, I'm the new fuse
Switch it up, now I'm back on that trap shit (On that trap)
Hit the block, hit the road, get it back quick (Get it back)
Had to bake half the work, make it backflip (Make it backflip)
Posted up on that block, for that package (Skrrt)
Shooters on call, this ain't no practice (Bah, bah)
Act quick, at your dome with that MAC stiff (Grrr)
Fast whip, spin your block, know you're tragic (Skrrt, skrrt)
Bitches know Floss with, all my Woos trappin' (Woo)
Ain't no average
09 to the Cloccs, all my niggas on point for that action
And we packin', sick a nigga if he jackin' that he stackin' (GDK)
Know my nigga savage
Skinny nigga but my pockets full of cabbage (Breesh)
Folk treesh from the floss, so they average
Blue cheese make these bitches throw they ass quick (Give me that)
Now I'm on top, hands out for the little six (Nah)
Man these niggas sick
Would they ask for the sauce if you ain't post the pic of your latest shits, can't get the drip (Never)
Niggas came for the sauce, that'll get you clipped careful with the four-fifth (Bah, bah, grah)
Hundred doors kicked (Grrr), keys in the cut
Don't try your luck, couple shots to your gut (Grrr)
Told my niggas ain't no lettin' up (Nah)
One call and I bet my shooters lift you up (Grrr)
Niggas talk, for what? (Bah, bah, bah)
They know, we bend blocks for sure, shoot what, shoot who?
Caught in the road, that pole give you two shots, who hot?
Don't give a fuck who block, free Clax, free Shots
Don't give a fuck who flock, get your hoe shot up

You already know it's that 100 Cloccs shit, man
Nigga, we out here, nigga
Fuck is you talkin' bout, nigga?
Spin the block, nigga (Grrrt)
Posted up on the block every day, nigga
Spin the block, nigga1Embed
