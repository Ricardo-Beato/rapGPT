43 ContributorsFlashflood Lyrics
We'll have more news after this commercial word
(And so it goes..)
At least I think I was here asleep
Is it possible? Conceivable?
That I sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berserk?

In slid rhythm, Fetter cycle bound by dilemma, debt, and vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment to park in front a fan
And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
Contestants get the New York home game with real life shoot 'em up-action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie and art freak game piece all included
I told this cat the Earth was flat, he walked 'till his beard grew
Long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
It's bric-a-brac novelties, spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed, tequila worm future, be concerned
My feelers spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'm a never give, I'm juiced off projection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born-agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the zed, I bait this data for my pledge
To bathe a traitor of the twice forgotten favors that he bled
And not a creature stirred
It reeks of subway metal, bevel edged journalist chin-on-fist shenanigans
Re-coin mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room
Mummified mannequins with future clenched adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This amalgam circus got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in the circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds
To see which one could track your trail and serve you, sucker
I lay the law down upon its belly while my foot
Dug in between the 3rd and 4th disc yelling "Break yo' self!"
I finally actualized data commission
Past penny tip jar donation arrangement, but a far fetch from stability
Took a hard pledge early on
Blood donor to drum dozer, plowing the metronome, home
Blown caddy-cornered to cockeyed sound booster
Sensationally seismograph
Stabbing away on stone tablet to sketch a grouchy future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down
Sample of cancelled development, courtesy America
Land of the freebase, home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt caught pinball blinker and citizens 1-X
Weren't steadied for this leaning grievance with dilapidated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece and sweat a bit to make my wookie ends meet
Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper out hierarchy
Passionate while they whine on some "Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie" shit
Suck the proverbial silver spoon 'till their parents quit apparently
Parasol spinning casually like
"I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me"
OK, time to buckle the fuck down
Solder your wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You could catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy-of-life logic don't employ the spite process
Hence your plight botches

No
I don't know what got into me
I didn't mean to cause all that destruction
I'm sorry
So sorry

This be the, this be the big
