15 ContributorsLight Another Lyrics
Yo light one, ignite one, enjoy me like the buddha
You say I'm the joint, but you can call me hooda
Computer, wizard, the butcher of scissors
Cut me up, then spark me, blow me out like a blizzard
Dwellin' your cells up, lungs start to swell up
Your pipe's gettin' crowded, yo just forget about it
Me, is potent, so bring an opponent
You could suck on that shit, I know you wanted it

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another

I'm smoother than a menthol cigarette
How could you figure, or even, consider that
I'm, a weak seed? No, I'm the Humboldt weed
I think that you need this spliff, this tweed
Any type of stylee, how do you spell it?
Take a hit from LA, New York into Phillie
Here's some Visine, smell the smoke and let out
Now do you really think you can take the red out it?
You might also like
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another

Spliff, aiyya, get on by ya
Why ya, want ta, turn off the fire?
You can't get higher, when you turn me off and
.. aiyyo, pussy stop coughin'
You're wastin' the lingo, soon all the sack's gone
He'll take this bounty rhyme for you to stack on
Anyway you have it, you love me like Mary Jane
Or a 40 to the head, like my brother Kenny Wayne
You need to inhale, musical paraphen'
Yes musical, Muggs fixed the trend
Ahhh, just like a head
Brain cells get lit, but I'm the joint you can't grip
Through, your finger, I'll start to sting ya
So just hear my words linger and

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo Muggs, light another!
Put me in the bambu, with just the tape deck
And the white brother rewinds the cassette
Was it, because it's funky that ya loves it?
(Yeah man) Here's another lyric, go puff it
Don't choke off, the hype or croak off
Wave the bud smoke off, hold until I get off
Or turn off the fat joint, wanna hit that joint
Here is the flat point, I rob it at gun point
I'm, the High Times, you get through my rhymes
Suck on the pipeline, sit back and recline
You gotta suck on, the fattie so come on and

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
I'll just, light another

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo, light another
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Aiyyo, light another
You wanna feel the effects of the high?
Can you feel the effects of the high? Can you feel it?
I feel the effects of the high -- yo can you feel it?
Yo light that motherfucker up man
I know you feel itEmbed
