(BassKids, answer your motherfuckin' phone, nigga)
(Hollywood J)
Need to

Take a nigga bitch in a Volkswagen Beetle
Put some dragon breath on you, now you're lookin' see-through
I got problems I don't wanna fix, but I need to, ayy

Folks in the jail cell, probably doin' push-ups
Ask me what I'm doing, gettin' money, say that's what's up
Cup up in my hand, liftin' up, I call it lean-ups
Consider that my bitch if I fuck with her for three-plus
Say she wanna kick it with me, I'm just like FIFA
Told her, "Stay away from my ice," it might freeze her
Told her, "Stick around," never know, I might need her
Think I beat my wife 'cause I wear a wife beater

Take a nigga bitch in a Volkswagen Beetle
Put some dragon breath on you, now you're lookin' see-through
I got problems I don't wanna fix, but I need to
When you're broke, who fuckin' care? When you're rich, they need you
You might also like
Drop in my gut, I got drop in my pee too
You don't smoke or drink, boy, your fuckin' pee see-through
My piss need goggles and telescopes to see through
I smell some fish, I'll turn that shit to seafood
Shoot, shoot my clip and let's let the ass see-through
Chief So' was bool at the WIIIC like a Regal
Chief So' was bool on the Front like a prostitute
Chief So' was bool on the Six, we'll pop at you
Chief So' was bool on the Lam' like a vegan
Chief So' was gangbangin', slangin' and slingin'
Chief So' had Beamers, Mercedes, and Demons
Chief So' wore granny clothes, now he the cleanestEmbed
