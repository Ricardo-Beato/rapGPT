86 ContributorsLoco Lyrics
I load the .44, then paint the Van Gogh
She rang the front door, she came commando
She came and rambled, I came and rolled over
No time for conversations, cold shoulders
Out of my mind, she off the red wine
She woozy, bitch bougie, straight from Dubai
She love the hip hop and love my slick talk
Gave head, then begged the boy to crip walk
I write the James Joyce, don't need the Rolls Royce
I need the straitjacket, finna go batshit
Sick of these rappers stealin' my swagger
Tryna run with the penmanship practiced
Gangsta gone Gatsby, fades with no lotion
Get this shit cracking, crack his jaw open
Crack in my system, Daddy loved smokin'
Like he loved smokin' niggas, no jokin'

Everybody get a little bit crazy
Seems like you've been feeling that lately
Everybody get a little bit lonely
Keep breathing slowly, slowly
Right place at the wrong time
Wrong turn in my own mind
Right place at the wrong time
Got lost in my own mind
You might also like
It's okay, hey Vince, it's me
Things are goin' pretty great now and this ain't what you need
Don't waste your time on a ignorant fuck
Send me some more money, we'll laugh it all up
Hey, remember how we used to fight in Pre-K?
Mama whooped that ass for three days
Parties at McDonald's for our birthday
It's okay, it's okay, guess I should say

Let me tell you 'bout when a nigga went crazy
At the Marriott, havin' Kurt Cobain dreams
Let me tell you 'bout when a nigga went loco
Ace hotel, should've stayed at the Soho
Housekeepin' keep knockin' on my door though
Don't she know I'm starin' in the mirror with a .44?
Tryna get my head straight, she tryna get the bed straight
No room to think, kaboom on the sink

Ugh, me tienes harta (Pinche baboso abre los ojos)
¿Quién te crees, eh? ¿El muy chingón? (Date cuenta de lo que tienes)
Tú no eres nadie (Ya no eres niño)
Todo lo que quieres hacer te sale mal (You're a grown-ass motherfuckin' man)
Eres un estúpido, no sabes nada
Nadie te toma en serio (I fuckin' hate you, just leave me the fuck alone)
¿Sabes qué? Vete a la chingada, me caes gordo (Pinche puto desgraciado)
Pinche vato pendejo (I fuckin' hate you)
Everybody get a little bit crazy
Seems like you've been feeling that lately
Everybody get a little bit lonely
Keep breathing slowly, slowly
Right place at the wrong time
Wrong turn in my own mind
Right place at the wrong time
Got lost in my own mind

It's okay, hey Vince, it's me
Things are goin' pretty great now and this ain't what you need
Don't waste your time on a ignorant fuck
Send me some more money, we'll laugh it all up
Hey, remember how we used to fight in Pre-K?
Mama whooped that ass for three days
Parties at McDonald's for our birthday
It's okay, it's okay, guess I should say

I'm in the black Benz speedin' with my black skin gleamin'
Out the window, tints low
Baby, come and see 'em where the rent low
Been gone, I don't need a shrink, I need a hit song
Tryna show the world a nigga tweakin'
Been a schizo crip though, off of 65th, though
When you're by the killer, I ain't aimin' when the shit blow
Jumpin' through your window, finna hit a lick mode
Thuggin' since the flip phone, don't be who I flip on
We all waste away, what are you lookin' for?
We all waste away, what do you got in store?
We all waste away 'cause I can't take much more
We all waste away, rather be lost and poor
What my pastor say? Some shit that I don't believe
What my master say? Nigga, you won't be free
Until you pass away, razor on my sleeve
Tryna compensate, this pain, it run so deep
"But you a star," they say, "You mean so much to me
Mean so much to me"10Embed
