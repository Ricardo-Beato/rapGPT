5 ContributorsSuckaz Lyrics
We in this bitch
We in this bitch like the very first time, nigga
Y'all know what time it is! Yeah!
Gooch! Gooch! Yeah! Shawty!
Talk to them suckaz real quick
Shawty! Leh'go!
Gucci Mane:
I served so many j's
Been locked up so many times!
I had to grind to shine
I'll fi you up bout mine!
I did a homicide
I'm ready to die bout mine!
Committed genocide
I testify bout mine!
I live a life of crime
I serve nicks, serve dimes!
Bitch, I got six for five
Cool whip two pots at a time!
You better recognize
I put my neck on the line!
I told you several times
You better respect my mind!
And I'm remixing pies
I gotta take out a 9!
And I'm re-fixing pies
I'm servin three at a time!
I hit a lick to shine
I left my boy in the blind!
Thats how it is sometimes
I keep my hand on the 9!

You better move ya feet
Know how the game goes
I'm steppin on toes
I'm steppin on toes
Man, I'm steppin on toes
I'm shittin on all my foes
I got that 4-4
I'm hittin that super smoke
Cool, friend or foe
A sucka bought me all this jewelry
A sucka bought me all this Louie
These suckaz got me riding New Bentleys
Finessing got my wrist so blurry
I'm a bachelor, I'm available, got bails and thier mailable
A Malibu condo with a great view of the sailing boats
Coke clean as a baby ass, they dug tunnels to get it here
Shout out to my cartel bitch fix me a cocktail
My block do cartwheels, got keys like a locksmith
I met a bitch so bad, I gave her keys to a mach 6
Versace my glasses, I skipped all my classes
My top in the trash, I left my top with my last bitch
Moved on to another ho, trade her in for a yellow bone
Four diamond chains stacked on my neck, it look like a herringbone
It's Gucci and Shawty, thank the lord that we beat the case
Them haters can holla, cause I think I need a hearing aid

You better move ya feet
Know how the game goes
I'm steppin on toes
I'm steppin on toes
Man, I'm steppin on toes
I'm shittin on all my foes
I got that 4-4
I'm in that super sport
Cool, friend or foe
A sucka bought me all this jewelry
A sucka bought me all this Louie
These suckaz got me riding New Bentleys
Finessing got my wrist so blurry
Shawty Redd:
Ha-haa!
I like coming in the booth, man
Fuckin with this nigga Gucci, man
We been doing this shit for a long, long time nigga
These suckaz bought this shit for us nigga, believe that... BURR!Embed
