Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
I took a Xan, I mixed it up with something
It was that Hen, I mixed it up with something
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
I took them bands, I mixed it up with something
Them rubber bands, I mixed it up with something

Took my car, I mixed it on them Forgi's
Took my gun, mixed it with a fucking orgy, that's a long clip
With a lot of fucking bullets
Shoot yo fucking ass if you try to bull it
Tity Boi, ridin' 'round and get it (Ayy)
And you know it's mines, you know I spend it (Ayy)
Lil Jon, A-Town stomp a nigga (Ayy)
Balling no NBA, I ain't humping niggas (Ayy)
But I get that pump and pump a nigga
Shoot him in his temple, God forgive him (Ayy)
I was mixing dope, left all the paraphernalia (Ayy)
I'ma dope seller, motherfuckin' nigga (Ayy)
Niggas say they trapping but they ain't (Ayy)
These fake trappers gon' make me faint (Ayy)
I'm on my way to the bank, hahaha (Ayy)
Is you mad or nah? (Ayy)

Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
I took a Xan, I mixed it up with something
It was that Hen, I mixed it up with something
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
I took them bands, I mixed it up with something
Them rubber bands, I mixed it up with something

Dope so good they thought I mixed it up with something
Coke so good they thought I mixed it up with something
My swag so good they thought I mixed it up with something
These thots steady wanting, these thots want my money
My watch so icy, thought I mixed it up with something
My chain so icy, thought I mixed it up with something
These niggas, they don't like me, thought I'm mixing up or something
Switching up or something, but I'm just getting money (Ayy)
Getting to these hundreds, fingering this money (Ayy)
Sipping on this Hen, making bitches cum and
Making bitches vomit, see me, they done fainted
Niggas getting painted, one shot, that nigga fainted
I like Audis, not Maseratis
Pull up, we gon' shoot up the party
Ain't no woah kemosabe
Or peace nigga, we about that war, B
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
I took a Xan, I mixed it up with something
It was that Hen, I mixed it up with something
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
Mix it up with something, mix it up with something
I took them bands, I mixed it up with something
Them rubber bands, I mixed it up with somethingEmbed
