A change for the better
I'm reading Your letter
There's love on the pages
There's love for the ages
Right, wrong, same song
Your grace still sufficient
No shame, we admit it
Your way's a higher way

Oh, send a new wave
Do a new thing
Don't wait
Please move...in new ways
Do new things, yes
We wait on you

And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow you
And I think of all the days my hope was through
And still you came and brought me through

Brought me through from shame, temptation
Hopelessness, no motivation
Accusers in the waves throwing dirt on my name (yeah)
What's my name without Your love?
(What's my name without You?)
Will not make it without Your love
(I won't make it)
You might also like
God, send a new wave
Do a new thing (yeah)
Don't wait
Please move
In new ways
Do new things
So we wait...on You (yes!)

And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow You
I think of all those days my hope was through
But still You came and brought me through

I can't be without Your love
I can't be without You
I can't do it, no
Won't you help me say it
I can't be without Your love
I can't be without Ya
I can't, I can't alone

And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow You
I think of all those days my hope was through
But still You came and brought me through
So, send a new wave
Do a new thing
Don't wait
Please move
In new ways
Do new things, yes
We wait on You!
Please move
Please move
Please do things
I know You can
I know

Came back for Him, the body was gone
All that was left was the stone
The Sword it was on
Two feet, on two wings
Blood and meat from the bone
A risen kingdom, but no mobile phones
Just faithful messengers
Everyday is being used in mysterious ways
And everything is a cost with some pain
Some lonely days, Jehovah knows
High on the throne, Christ to the right
This pen can't write the sights of my home
In spite of miracles, doubt abounds
Octo-, with tentacles
I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown
I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown
I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknownEmbed
