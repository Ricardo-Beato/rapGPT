6 ContributorsOne Day At A Time (Outro) Lyrics
I took one step forward and two steps back
I jumped so many hurdles to get where I'm at
I had one foot out and I had one foot in
And I ain't gonna look back if I get one more chance
And it's one thing that a nigga must understand
That tomorrow's not promised, this is your last dance
And I'ma leave my past with this one line
Try to live your life one day at a time (it's Gucci)

Now our bills anything
Then why I'm still hurting then?
My cousin said, "it's not a house Gucci
So why the fuck it got a curtain then?"
I applied for a job once
Really went with the workin'
But soon as I got the work in
It seemed niggas started hatin'
I wasn't good ridin' skateboards
I was better ridin' Daytons (yeah)
I can't lie I need to pray for it
But it took a lot of patience
