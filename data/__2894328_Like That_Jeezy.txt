8 ContributorsLike That Lyrics
Yeah, trey, yeah
Yeah, yeah, like that
Swear to God nigga

I left the hood like nigga I'll be right back
Then I blew up, they ain't like that
See about your money bitch, I like that
Twerk and look back at it, bitch it's like that
They way them jeans fit that ass, girl I like that
I gives a fuck about your past, I ain't like that
Street nigga with some class, bitches like that
You better holler when you see me, bitch it's like that, uh

All these bitches on me, bitch I'm back in shape
They all want a piece of Jizzle like a cake
I'm what these bitches need, I'm dark skinned Drake
I'm bout to hit it back to back, now how much can you take?
Fuck you back to sleep and you gon' dream about it
You gon' be like K. Michelle, bitch you gon' sing about it
Suck the skin off the head, I call her skeletal
Make you wake up in the morning and check a credit score
Make you want to go and pay that mouth a visit
Next time I'm on tour I'll leave that mouth a ticket
She like Rihanna when she working, she a fool with it
She only call me if we fucking and I'm cool with it, uh
You might also like
I left the hood like nigga I'll be right back
Then I blew up, they ain't like that
See about your money bitch, I like that
Twerk and look back at it, bitch it's like that
They way them jeans fit that ass, girl I like that
I gives a fuck about your past, I ain't like that
Street nigga with some class, bitches like that
You better holler when you see me, bitch it's like that, uh

Health is wealth, baby we need to exercise
And you know it's leg day, I'm bout to work them thighs
Tryna stretch you out like you've been doing yoga
Have a three some with the money, just me, you, and Oprah
Take it all off, leave on your Jimmy Choos
That girl got soaking wet, I thought it was a cruise
And last time I hit her, I took off my shoes
I done called her twice today, I'm breaking all my rules
Make you wanna go and pay that mouth a visit
Next time I'm on tour, I leave that mouth a ticket
She like Amber when she twerking, she a fool with it
She only call me when she horny and I'm cool with it

I left the hood like nigga I'll be right back
Then I blew up, they ain't like that
See about your money bitch, I like that
Twerk and look back at it, bitch it's like that
They way them jeans fit that ass, girl I like that
I gives a fuck about your past, I ain't like that
Street nigga with some class, bitches like that
You better holler when you see me, bitch it's like that, uh3Embed
