51 ContributorsFeel Good Lyrics
Multi-million dollar deals
Got a million dollar deal
When I was younger
I would wonder how a million dollars feel
And for real, it feel like I ain't even broke the seal
'Cause when you drop hits they want you to pick up the bill
Now my, life is in Maryland
My heart is in Chicago
New York state of mind but out LA man that's where I go
When I need to lay this shit down
So much on my mind, that's the reason I'm spitting now
Finally running the game and everybody tripping now
But I can't give a damn I got they bitches dripping now
Moet we sipping now
Yeah, we came a long way
I know a lot of people thought they'd never see the day
That we get big like Notorious
'Cause we battle like warriors in the state of euphoria
My team is so fucking glorious
So I'ma love life while you live life
'Cause I ain't perfect but I do my best to live it right, yeah

Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

I should have took the time to understand the world
But I was just too busy tryna understand them girls
I never told anyone but I asked my ex to marry me
A couple months later the bitch buried me
And I know what y'all thinking
Logic, there's still hope
Keep yo chin up mothafucker
Ain't no reason to mope
Plus you got a lot of money and your music is dope
What's all the money in the world if yo heart still broke
But let's get back to the subject cause I was off of the topic
Hand me the mic and I rock it
They say they hate it then jock it, shit
I remember no heat in the winter time
Now that I'm eating haters grilling me like dinner time
Tryna make a living off of what we've been giving
Since a younging I've been driven
Just tryna do it how I do it, huh
From my city to your city, to Chi-city
We blowing up at high velocity, waddup
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready27Embed
