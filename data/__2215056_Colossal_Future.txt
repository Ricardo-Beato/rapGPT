The luxury of havin' passion
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
God damn

(Yeah) This shit gettin' colossal (I knew it)
This shit gettin' colossal (Brrt)
This shit gettin' colossal (Let's get it, let's get it)
This shit gettin' colossal (Yeah)
We trap out the traphouse, we love it, we gettin' that money (That traphouse, we gettin' it)
We trap out the traphouse, just know that we love it, we gettin' that money (We gettin' it)
This shit gettin' colossal

Hunnas on hunnas, do numbers on numbers, get llamas on llamas (llamas on llamas)
Got bales by the bundle
Got hunters that's gone, there's a hun' in the joint, that's a hundred on hundred
Trapped out the house with my partners
We went to shoppin' on midget
We went to cop it and get it, take flights out the city
We go to AZ and send it
We go to AZ and get it
I'm hungry, I admit it, I swear I'm conditioned
I served and I hustled on any conditions
Fuck your permission, I'll get to them digits
Come to your town and I get and split it
I get them stacks and get busy
I get that gat and get busy
I take that crack and I flip it
I be in all black like a villain
Hop out the 'Lac on some pimpin'
Step to that bitch, like I'm Goldie
Half of these niggas, they bogus
Most of these niggas, they bogus
I go to coast to coast, I'm fully loaded
I hit the lights for roaches just to scatter
I had to go to work with heavy metal
I done seen dead bodies in the ghetto
I seen these bitches dancin' with the devil
I seen that money make a bitch evil

This shit gettin' colossal (Brrt)
This shit gettin' colossal (Let's get it, let's get it)

We trap out the traphouse, we love it, we gettin' that money (That traphouse, we gettin' it)
We trap out the traphouse, just know that we love it, we gettin' that money (We gettin' it)
This shit gettin' colossal

I fell in love with a kickstand
I serve that bitch with my left hand
I'm 'bout to open a meth lab
I set the blow on the jetway
Called up some places for some big faces
I be in B-More like I'm a Raven
We trap out this bitch 'til the police raid it
I seen that coco turn bad when it get in the pot
I'm sorta like a chef when I'm over the pot
I'm sorta like a ref when we talk 'bout these streets
Whistle official, my pocket gorilla
We trap out these buildings and make us some millions
Poverty didn't get the best of my game
We took all this game and went bought us some chains
We fucking these bitches, ain't none of 'em gettin' claimed
I'm straight up deranged
I jump out the Range
I go to the Flame on a Wednesday
That molly, that drank and that kush
I think I went over my limit
Stack after stack after stack
I'm throwin' this shit to the ceiling
Got three Audemars and a Bentley
And it's one hell of a feeling
(Ha-ha)
This shit gettin' colossal (Brrt)
This shit gettin' colossal (Let's get it, let's get it)
This shit gettin' colossal (Yeah)
We trap out the traphouse, we love it, we gettin' that money (That traphouse, we gettin' it)
We trap out the traphouse, just know that we love it, we gettin' that money (We gettin' it)
This shit gettin' colossal
