Come on, man

Everybody's shirt off

F-R-E-N-C-H-I-E (Uh)
I'm tatted up, come find me, a hundred thou', So Icey (Eeh)
We, we poppin' bottles, showin' thug love
If you act up in the club then you know we throwin' hollows (Bah)
What it do, partner? (Yeah), get too close, I'll spark you
My wrist inside the club is like a highlighted marker (Uh-huh)
On beats, I'm a monster, So Icey, I sponsor (Yeah, yeah)
This Mary Jane got on the wall like Peter Parker (Yeah, yeah, oh)
I'm 'bout to call Waka, tell him "Bring the chopper" (Blatt)
Fuck seein' the doctor, he'll be screamin' like the opera (Uh-huh)
It's hot as hell, I gotta take off my shirt, my car, my girls love to wear skirts
The paint color look like dirt, no shirts in that '08 Vert (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, go)

Money doin' something to my ego (Uh)
More money I see, I'm gettin' tatted like a Migo, yeah (Yeah)
White girl say she can sniff a brick a day
I tell her eat the cake, eat the cake, Anna Mae (Bah)
Go, go, you better clean the plate (Yeah)
She said "I think I'm dead" (Why?) "'Cause I can't feel my face", uh-huh (Yeah)
And she think she gettin' dollars from the kid
All she get is hard dick, she swallowin' my kids (G, G, G, yeah, woah)
I know they feelin' me 'cause I'm movin' like a G move (Brr)
And my red and black skirt and her brand new Prada matchin' my Evisus (Uh-huh, ayy)
No wife-beater so I'm showin' off my sleeves (Yee)
This is art, so I'ma call it goin' with the breeze (Yee, yee, yee, yee, uh)

Six, one deep, no shirt, no top (Go)
White chain, bright lane, VVS white rocks (Blaow)
I'm a work of art, man, I'll crush your ice game (Huh?)
Thousand dollars light, man, need to rob a dice game (Yeah)
Tatted like a white man, party like a rock band
The So Icey bike game makin' lames tuck chains
Goddamn, Gucci Mane, you done did that shit again (Lit)
Going knee-deep in the earth so that you can have a chain (Brr)
My body wrote on like an ese but, homie, no Mexican (Yeah, ho)
I'm So Icey Entertainment, you can write it on me, man (Yeah, ho)
On the center of the stage with no tank top (No, no)
For the block I'm showin' every tattoo I got (Yeah)
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin' (Phew)
I take my shirt off and all the hoes stop breathin' (Phew)
