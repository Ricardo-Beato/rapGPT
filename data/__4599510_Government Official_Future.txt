32 ContributorsGovernment Official Lyrics
Please stop what you're doing, yeah, yeah, yeah
FBG FXX with me, it’s more number ones to tend to

I just went out to Morocco to do some recruitin' (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck the government official, we plugged with Putin (Yeah, yeah)
Got two twin sisters, yeah, they squirt, they be shootin' (Yeah, yeah)
Don’t get the squirt-squirt on the shirt-shirt, be a fool (Yeah, yeah)
They drank the wine bar, pop lot of bars, on the move (Yeah, yeah)
I turn the bando to a jewelry store, what I do (Yeah, yeah)
I turned a penthouse to a hotel (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm talkin' 54 hoes, had 'em snortin' fishscale (Yeah, yeah)

Had to hit it off a fingernail, oh well, well, well (Yeah)
Got some bad shit in Israel oh well, well, well (Yeah)
I can't be tellin' no lies to you, let's jump on a boat (Woah, yeah)
Went to Lagos, Nigeria, travelin’ coast to coast
Had to treat her like the Coast Guard, had to save a broad (Oh yeah, yeah)
We got the oil money comin’ in, smokin' out the vapor (Yeah, yeah)
She talkin’ British when they can't understand, but I feel it (Yeah, yeah)
African, gave my bitch a lil' hunnid bands, I can dig it (Yeah, yeah)

Told me she gettin' back to the city, she comin’ to spend it (Yeah)
Got two twin sisters, yeah, they squirt, they be shootin' (Yeah, yeah)
Don't get the squirt-squirt on the shirt-shirt, be a fool (Yeah, yeah)
I turn the bando to a jewelry store, what I do (Yeah, yeah)
You might also like
I feed them racks to you like a monster, that's food (Yeah, yeah)
Somethin' like a sponsor, I'm a player, yeah, I tell the truth (Yeah)
There's nothing I couldn't conquer, oh well, oh well, well (Yeah)
Got the hottest ones comin' from Brazil, oh well, oh yeah
She see the better side of me, she threw us a party
I got six sons, I'm a don like they last name Marley (Yeah)
Go lay in the sun, put your hair in a bun, ride it like a Harley (Yeah, yeah)
I got that one-of-one spill, so they record me (Record me)

I just went out to Morocco to do some recruitin' (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck the government official, we plugged with Putin (Yeah, yeah)
Got two twin sisters, yeah, they squirt, they be shootin' (Yeah, yeah)
Don't get the squirt-squirt on the shirt-shirt, be a fool (Yeah, yeah)

When I drink codeine, I get in my feelings (My-my feelings)
All I wanna see you in the same place as I'm in (I'm-I'm in)
I like takin' ecstasy, it made me a millionaire (Made me a millionaire)
It made me get emotional with the bitches (Emotional with the bitches)

I feed them racks to you like a monster, that's food (Yeah, yeah)
Told me she's gettin' back to the city, she's comin' to spend it (Yeah)6Embed
