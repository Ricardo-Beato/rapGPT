27 ContributorsLove Hater Lyrics
Everybody needs a glass of water today
To chase the hate away
You know you've got company comin' over
So you scrub extra hard
And everybody needs somebody to love

Before it's too late, it's too late
Oh, don't nobody wanna grow old alone

Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders
And scratch their dandruff
And everybody need to quit actin' hard and shit
Before you get your ass whooped (I'll slap the fuck out ya!)
And everybody needs somebody to love
Before it's too late, it's too late

Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater

Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs someone to love
