The girl in my dream
The girl from my dream
Is sittin' right next to me, next to me
Is sittin’ right next to me, next to me
The girl of my dreams
Is sittin' right next to me, next to me

If I'm bein’ honest, let me be honest
Baby, we're beyond this
All these petty arguments
A plus and a minus
The feeling is timeless
Yeah I fucked up in the past but let's put it behind us, yeah

Shout your name in hills in the valley
Whole world's gonna know you love me
Scream your name across the galaxy
Now the universe know that I'm on the same thing
Shout your name in hills in the valley
Whole world's gonna know you love me
Scream your name across the galaxy
Now the universe know that I'm on the same thing
Now the universe know that I'm on the same thing
Now the universe know that I’m on the same goddamn thing
You might also like
Her name in my brain
I’ll never leave her alone, no way
No you can't go back home, you’re with me
When you're not here, can't sleep, can't breathe, can’t think
I can't seem to think of a world without we
Vision cloudy, you need me
I need you more

The girl in my dream
The girl from my dream
Is sittin' right next to me, next to me
Is sittin' right next to me, next to me
The girl of my dreams
Is sittin' right next to me, next to me

Shout your name in hills in the valley
Whole world's gonna know you love me
Scream your name across the galaxy
Now the universe know that I'm on the same thing
Shout your name in hills in the valley
Whole world's gonna know you love me
Scream your name across the galaxy
Now the universe know that I'm on the same thing28Embed
