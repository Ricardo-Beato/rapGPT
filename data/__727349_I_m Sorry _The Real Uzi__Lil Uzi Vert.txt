15 ContributorsIâ€™m Sorry (The Real Uzi) Lyrics
Yeah
Count that money

I bet you are my lover
Had to cut her off I'm sorry
And you know I couldnn't trust her
Tell that bitch don't call me
Hunnit bands on me I'm sorry
And I'm off that lean I'm sorry
And I'm bout to get that 'Rari
So tell that bitch I'm sorry

Now I'm gettin' money
Sure that bitch gone call me
But back when I was fucked up
I said that bitch yeah she ain't call me
So I ain't worry bout a hoe
Ever since I got my bands up
And if you talking bout my bands bruh
I swear that you would get blamed up
Yea we just goin' crazy
And my niggas yea they soldiers
A nigga thought he told ya
FN57 wit no holster
I would pop a nigga and show ya
I been gettin' money thought I rolled up
Yeah I need the 'Rari it's so new bruh
And I don't know the name
Nigga I don't know the name
But a nigga livin' life...

I bet you are my lover
Bout' to cut her off I'm sorry
And you know I couldn't trust her
Tell that bitch don't call me
Hunnit bands on me I'm sorry
And I'm off that lean I'm sorry
And I'm bout to get that 'Rari
So tell that bitch I'm sorry

Sorry girl, I'm so sorry
