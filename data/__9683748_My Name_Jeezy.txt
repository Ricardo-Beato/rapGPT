9 ContributorsMy Name Lyrics
Yeah, uh huh, yeah
Hahaha
What the fuck, nigga?

Seen them 36s go from Jordan to Scottie Pippen (Aye)
I ain’t gon’ let ‘em play with my name, see Scottie trippin’ (haha)
I done went out and got a plug out in France, that’s what I’m sippin’
And you ain’t about to play with my name, y’all niggas trippin’

The man, yeah, the myth (Myth)
That's probably why he stiff (Woo)
Take him back to Lumpkin Road, it was clear he had a gift (Damn)
That's word to Donatello them, I came from the sewer (Sewer)
Wash the smut and the mud, oh shit entrepreneuer (Haha)
Take 'em out the duct tape and throw away the wrappеrs (Wrappers)
Seven grams likе golf balls, I'm tryna win the Masters
Never like consignment, that's why I bought my masters (Woo)
How you getting facts from some niggas who ain't factors? (Hah)
Only niggas talkin' crazy is the ones with no motion (Motion)
That's like the kitchen sink talkin' crazy 'bout the ocean (Damn)
And when they mention me, all I'm hearing is emotion
Haters of the year, y'all should give 'em a promotion

Seen them 36s go from Jordan to Scottie Pippen (Ay)
I ain’t gon’ let ‘em play with my name, see Scottie trippin’ (Haha)
I done went out and got a plug out in France, that’s what I’m sippin’ (Yeah)
And you ain’t about to play with my name, y’all niggas trippin’ (Ay)

You got the right plan (Plan), but the wrong man (Yeah)
Ain't no nigga made me, nigga, I'm my own man (Woo)
One twenty-five, yeah, I whip that shit for practice
Flip it on the other side like they count that money backwards (Haha)
They talkin' with their ego and leadin' with their pride (Pride)
It ain't the fact they hatin', it's just the fact they lied (Yeah)
Twistin' up the story, go and tell them for the truth (Truth)
Let them hang themself, even tie their own noose (That's right)
When they show you who they are, damn right, you best believe (Ay)
Universe showin' signs, damn right, you best receive (Yeah)
And when they mention me, all I'm hearing is emotion
Haters of the year, y'all should give 'em a promotion

Seen them 36s go from Jordan to Scottie Pippen (Ay)
I ain’t gon’ let ‘em play with my name, see Scottie trippin’ (Haha)
I done went out and got a plug out in France, that’s what I’m sippin’ (Yeah)
And you ain’t about to play with my name, y’all niggas trippin’ (Ay)Embed
