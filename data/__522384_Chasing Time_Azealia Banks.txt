31 ContributorsChasing Time Lyrics
(Damn nigga damn, took a chance on ya, double and dipped again)
GO!
You could do your dance
Take a chance with your lover like this began!
Sing

I want somebody who can take it apart
Stitch me back together make me into who I wanna be
But all you ever do is sit in the dark
Dealing with the Devil, you ain’t never ever gonna be mine

Cause I’m born to dance in the moonlight
I feel like spending my nights alone
I try to give you a little more space to grow
White lies, I don’t wanna be around anymore
I’m through giving, I’ve got to go....

Am I chasing time?
Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
Am I chasing time? (time)
Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
You might also likeCheck my watch, I had the future in my pocket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)
If tomorrow drops, I had my time right in my locket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)

Damn, nigga, damn
Took a chance on you, double and dipped again
And, scram, nigga, scram
Hit your mans up and tell ‘em to get the van
And reminiscing can't
Bring it back to the cabin in Michigan
But man, this the plan
Say goodbye to your lover cause this the end
 + 

Yo, get lost hit the highway, freeway
We've been off-course like the wrong-way relay
Need me a boss, you’re a constant delay
These the kinda thoughts I've been having for three days...
Feel like you’re more of a homie
Please, you don’t even know me
You think I’m starting new relations
I’m just departing and need my space and
Time to myself, ventilation
No time for you, I lack the patience
And you’re like, “Girl, how you do that?"
My attitude is bitchy but you already knew that...
And since we can’t get along
I think we should both move on
(GO!)
