12 ContributorsLost Souls Lyrics
This is me
This gon' be me for the next 10-15 fuckin' years
Y'all out there thinkin' this cool?
When y'all see me again I'll be worse than I was when I came in this bitch
Now imma stone cold don't give a fuck
Let them bitches give me 10-15 years and see me when I get out
And tha-that's what you do dawg
An when you come back, come back in 10 more years man
After this shit done grew on a nigga a little bit
And see what kinda nigga I done turned into
Cause you see em' every day
They the lost fools out there baby, don’t give a fuck
Ready to go back…

Couple bitches made a living working the pole
Couple niggas made a career working the bowl
They say they give gave this test to be told and never sold
Bow our heads and take a min to pray for these lost souls
Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord Knows
They got me praying for these lost souls
Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord Knows
They got me praying for these lost souls

Jamie, Rochelle and Sugar the baddest bitches I ever seen
I couldn’t get enough of them bitches they was in every dream
Seen it with my own eyes know them bitches made a mill
One hundred black shirts I know them niggas spent a mill
Lil Oowee yeah I heard he just got 39
Even though the nigga young, still a whole lot of time
He used to run with D Boy, they messed around and cut his penis off
Gave that boy a big bag like he ain't seen the soft
Left and came back, silver Rarri, in a black range
Seen 'em at the Chevron on 10th street and it was strange
Hope he don’t bring his 'lil brother in he gonna regret it
Wit them just indicted O-Dog, happened exactly how I said it

That nigga T White had that Phantom all up in traffic
From white tee to white collar shit that nigga hell with them taxes
I’m screaming  CPort free Screw what it do
Rasheena fine ass went to the feds that was my boo
What about Black with that boy had that boy
And every time he in the strip club he bring them bitches joy
Chazo still dancing her old ass still fine
Seen her throw a retirement party 6 times
Yeah this one for Nando God bless his soul
Know he at a strip club in heaven that don’t ever close
Told me don’t shine on them too hard cause Young you gone regret it
They start to feel ya, they want to kill ya It happened exactly how he said it
