Maybe, maybe
Oh

Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G

I can't lie, sometimes I'm feeling low
Please get out of my mind, I'mma find out which way to go
I need to take control, had a problem ahead of me
I could never let it be reality
I've come to find out, I'm not the one who says to hide out
So many alone insecurities
See you were checking and I get it
I am a maniac I admit it, do you get it

Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G

Maybe, ooh
Maybe, ahh
Maybe, ooh
Maybe, ahh (Whoa)

No lie, some days are better days
Walk into my mind, my heart will know the way
I need to take it slow, but I don't know another route
I could never let this be the end of days the end of dreams
So sure, I'll be okay
My mind is stronger than yours, way quicker no lie
See youâ€™re projecting and I get it
Hey, I am a maniac I admit it, do you get it

Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, baby
Maybe I'm not exactly what you want me to be
Maybe you need not worry bout me, my G
Maybe, ooh
Maybe, ahh
Maybe, ooh
Maybe, ahh (Whoa)13Embed
