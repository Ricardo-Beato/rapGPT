Tears cried, tears dried
Love gained, love lost (Lost)
Real life, ill mind
Much pain, much cost (Yes)
Uprise, downfall
Fuck nice, outlaw (Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw, outlaw)
Wait

Alright, let's get it (Yeah)
(I'm) Not a nice nigga
Soul is slightly demonic that's why you see lights flicker (Flick)
Lower your eyes and let your mind enterâ€“ (Enter)
Into a new dimension to visit divine sinners (Yikes)
Know I'll make all my enemies cry rivers
People be lookin' at me funny like I give a (Fuck)
You niggas nothin' but line sniffers
This is the return of the omen, your time is up (Let's go)
Titanic and ice pillars, it's goin' down (Yeah)
Supply madness, 'cause shy niggas get voted out (Yeah)
With my passion my life shoulda been over now (What)
'Cause I'm manic, a spite villain, a motor mouth
Five years I've been tumblin' endless
Trying to climb out the bloodiest trenches, fuckin' horrendous
Mixing honeys and friends with money and sins
Eventually gets under your skin, I got grudges to live withYou might also likeEmbed
