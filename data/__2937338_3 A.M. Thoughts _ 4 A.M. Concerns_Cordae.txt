11 Contributors3 A.M. Thoughts / 4 A.M. Concerns LyricsPart I: 3 A.M. Thoughts

I saw myself in the mirror and I was just wasn't proud
You been ignoring the open window that come around
I mean let's say we begin and being lazy's a sin
You rather get crazy with friends til you staging your end
And with all the time lost you degrading your pen
And now you living check to check, gotta save for the rent
No one to blame but yourself, could have the fame and your wealth
But niggas rather spend it all on chains and a belt
I mean I never understood but each is it own
I'm reminded of my faults when I'm deep in the zone
And you always gotta peep who you keep in your home
It ain't no fooling me twice, no repeating my wrongs
Because I learn, I learn all from my mistakes
I try to get it, I get in in different kind of ways
We come from crooked fathers, ancestors, Brooklyn Dodgers
Generated to gangsters, ballers, to crooks and mobsters
My generations be Christians, they tell 'em look for Harvard
So I run the game for saint but Reggie Bush the starter
I'm 'bout to wild today and cheer like it's 2008
Back when "My president is black" was something proud to say
'cause shit I haven't seen change and Uzi drive a green Range
And life is draining everybody's hope, it's such a mean game
It' slapped me in the face, I got a taste at just as teenage
Think about my past, I chose my path, I go complete rage
I feel just like a author, got a story to tell
Where you choose two paths, either glory or hell
I mean we all got a road to follow, perform shows Apollo
And just blow colossal, believe me I know
Some listening thinking "Damn, this far fetched"
But I'll be shooting for the moon and hit the stars next
You might also like'Cause all we could is ride, all we do is ride, we got to
When you down to your fucking last, who can stop you?
'Cause nigga I know, nigga I know how to get it
Nigga I know
Part II: 4 A.M. Concerns

If you deal with war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap)

You can let it go
You can let it go
No, no, no, no

Uh, rhyming just for the sake of rhyming
Making deals with bills, I gotta face the timing
But I'm ill with skills, a nigga patient minded
The beat killed and drilled, I gotta face the violence
It's flu season, these niggas hating for two reasons
Other rappers is salty, a nigga too seasoned
Other average and faulty, I'm a just a cool deacon
I'm too great with a new tape, like dude wait
I'm like Biggie, I'm hopping to never lose faith
And Mike Bibby the mind, I gotta shoot straight
And most likely supreme leader, a new age
Niggas shooting machine heaters and tools blaze
The game full of the fiends, divas and blue haze
Niggas listen to music like "Damn, this dude's great"
A small mixture of dark liquor and Lupe
A tall nigga, it's all scripture what you say
And all year I been killing the classics
Making the Good music and appealing to masses
Man they feeling this bastard, the realest of rappers
Surrounded by the goats, never chilling with average
'Cause I remember days when I didn't have the worries
I remember days me and Parris had 'em nervous
I remember days when we would kill it purpose
And now they gonna pay me service, it's worth it
I remember days when we was choppin' at the function
I remember days when we didn't have nothin'
All them late night on the grind count for somethin'
So fuck all the stupid assumption they wantin'

I see through all moves, John Wall and Brad Beal
I'm mad real, let's get it poppin' like Advil
But when you're seeing your people dying it's a sad feel
Enjoy life, you never know when's your last meal
It's so trife and crazy just how a blast kill
So please stop the judging me of my past still
'Cause soon all a nigga rocking is pastel
The best coming from DMV since Fat Trel
Niggas quitting and snitching, they grow a rat's tail
Like dude broke how the hell you make a fast bail
Putting out garbage albums for a fast sell
Don't needs that, the game faded like cheap tats
I preach facts, I piss music and bleed rap
So fuck no I don't need negative feedback
'Cause honestly I been dope since the eight grade
So make way 'cause a nigga on a mayday
I remember days when we was choppin' at the function
I remember days when we didn't have nothin'
All them late night on the grind count for somethin'
So fuck all the stupid assumption they wantin'
I remember days when I didn't have the worries
I remember days me and Parris had 'em nervous
I remember days when we would kill it purpose
And now they gonna pay me service, it's worth it1Embed
