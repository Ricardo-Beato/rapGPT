No competition
No competition

Competition is none
I remain at the top like the sun
And I burn whoever come
In the chambers of torture, I caught you
You should have brought your neighborhood to support you
No one in my path can withstand
Under pressure, the wrath of a swift man
You name the day, the grounds could be neutral
Speak your piece, the feeling's mutual
We can go topic from topic, whenever I drop it
Try to stop it
In other words, what the brother heard
He tried to catch it, but what occurred
Was too much weight for one brain to take
Try to concentrate maintain then elevate
From gram to ounce to pound to pound
The matter of weight can't hold my mind down
Permanent damage, I do away with
No time for fun 'cause I don't play with
Competitors, it's only one when I'm done
You might also like
Competition is none
No competition

Competition is none
I'm the sole survivor, emcees get live but I get liver
It ain't a Memorex, live in concert
In every network, the R's the expert
Whoever goes against causes friction
Introduction, music, where's the mixing
Ra will never die, soon they'll never try
To beat or defeat me because whenever I
Put poetry in motion
From the Nile, then out to the ocean
Three-fourths of water makes seven seas
A third of land, 360 degrees
I circulate and remain to rotate
Seven days a week at a quick or a slow rate
Be prepared whenever I come

Competition is none
It's no competition

Creator, the alphabets, let's communicate
When I translate, the situation's straight
No dictionary's necessary to use
Big words do nothing but confuse and illuse
From the first step, my concept is kept
To the end of the rhyme, it get more in-depth
All thoughts I come across, my mind's the source
Made by the R, of course
Seven holes in my face as I'm looking out my window
Speak with the beat and it seems like the wind blows
Through the speakers, I hear it, so pump this
And we can fill up the whole circumference
With competition, on an impossible mission
Coming up with nothing, keep fishing
No runner up, just lost or forfeits
They all get butterflies soon as the door gets
Unlocked, line for blocks and blocks
Might be trifling to call the cops
Bring along paramedics
But that won't help you, not even calisthenics
I'm God, G is the seventh letter made
Reining on rappers, it's no parade
So if you ain't wise, then don't even come
Competition for this and the mixin' is none
It's no competition
Competition is none3Embed
