Alright y'all, we here now!
(This, is, a, Supa Supa, blast blast, Supa Supa, blast blast)

Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl (Relax your mind, y'all, )
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl (Get down, y'all)
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl
Get down

Just another day in a lonely world
Where I like to make a lonely girl
Feel a little less lonely
Tell a tale where she's my one and only
She got homegirls who likes to do more than chat
So she asked where my homies at
I mean that song was fly (If my homies can't have none)
But if my homie can't have none, sayin' I won't have fun is honestly just a God damned lie~!
Self-missions are less stress, and cut out the mess
Of havin a girl, verifyin' if I'm lyin or not
With her girl, 'cause my niggas occupyin the same spot with her
I'm like the fox with the fur, well groomed
You find me in hot clubs and hotel rooms, or between the sheet crack
And if the bed squeaks or noise-free, I'll put it to use
Swig from the tiger beers for the extra boost
Blow out your back like flames over the cake
Cut out a piece of your heart, for the claim
When I get you worked up to cream, and I can get on
Some Snoop Dogg shit and scream, "What's my motherfuckin name?"

Let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl (Get down, y'all, )
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl
Relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Relax your mind (Let your conscience be free)
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl (Get down, y'all)
Get down

Hey, we in the position to renew things
I specialise in doin' me and you things
Now what's that he say she say?
We got mortgages, dump all this gossip you're hoardin'
This world premier is for real, ma
A catalogue of lovin' you can hear, ma
Put the quarter in the jukebox
I brought a bit of luggage, drawers and a few socks
A little Dane Dane, and some X-Clan
I'm tryin' to save you from the chores of the next man
See we can picnic, and go horseback
I love your laughter, even if you sound like Horshack
You so impeccable, but damn them birds peck at you (Uh-huh)
Your technique is cuttin' like you catch beats (Uh-huh)
Affectin' these nuts 'cause your sex speaks (Uh-huh)
We oughta "Chill" like EPMD
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl (Get down, y'all)
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free (We match, peace)
Get down girl, get down girl
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
Get down girl, get down girl
Get downEmbed
