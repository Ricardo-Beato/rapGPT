9 ContributorsSo Cold Lyrics
I'm so cold
I'm so cold
Cold
I'm so cold, my wrist froze, ayy
I'm so cold, wipe my nose
I'm so cold, wipe my nose, ayy
I'm so cold, my time froze, ayy
Hop out Glo, my white clothes, ayy
Nothing but poles and bankrolls, ayy

I'm so cold, wipe my nose, ayy ayy
I'm so cold, my time froze, ayy ayy
Hop out Glo, my white clothes, ayy ayy
Nothing but poles and bankrolls, ayy ayy
My bitch be cold, ayy, my niggas be cold, ayy
My guns, my cars, my house, my city be cold, ayy
But I grew up out that shit like a centipede though, ayy
And now I'm Glo'd, bitch nigga try me, it'll be cold, ayy

Cops grab me, I don't know, ayy
I go where I want go, ayy ayy
I was tourin', come though, ayy ayy
Bitch I'm cold, I got the smoke, ayy ayy
I got some dough, I want some more, ayy ayy
I'm off this dope, I want some more, ayy ayy
She got this dope, she want some more, ayy ayy
She want some dope, I told her no, ayy ayy
Now you know it's time to go, ayy ayy
Grab your coat, hit the road, ayy ayy
Bitch, don't come back no more, ayy
'Cause you couldn't Glo fucking with So, ayy
It's me and my hoes and my hoes, ayy
It's me and the Glo, them my bros, ayy
I'll sleep in the cold with my pole, ayy
'Cause I can't trust a soul, ayy ayy (Bang)

My guns, my cars, my house, my city be cold, ayy
But I grew up out that shit like a centipede though, ayy
