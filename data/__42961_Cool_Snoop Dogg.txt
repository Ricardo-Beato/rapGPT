4 ContributorsCool Lyrics
What time is it...

I got a penthouse in Manhattan
Two more in Malibu
I bought a eight-seven Cadillac Seville
I got a Maserati too
I wear diamonds on my fingers
I got a couple on my toes
I wear the finest cologne money can buyyyy
It keeps me smellin like a rose
If you're wonderin how I do it
There's just one simple rule
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Honey baby can't you see
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Ain't nobody bad like me; spelled (C, O-O-L)
What's that spell? (C, O-O-L)
I might dine in San Francisco
Dance all night in Rome
I go any freakin place I want to
And my Lear jet brings me home
I got ladies by the dozen
I got money by the ton
Just ain't nobody better
Heaven knows that I'm the one
You might also likeIt's all because of somethin
That I didn't learn in school
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Honey baby can't you see
I'm so cool (cool!!)
Ain't nobody bad like me; spelled (C, O-O-L)
What's that spell? (C, O-O-L)

And I'm cool
I'm just cool-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-cool
I'm just cool, c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c
Co-co, co-co-co, coo-coo-coo, I'm just cool, cool
I'm just cool
Coo-coo-cool

When I look into the mirror
It just tells me somethin I already know
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Honey baby can't you see
I'm just cool (cool!!)
Ain't nobody bad like me; spell it~! (C, O-O-L)
What's that spell? (C, O-O-L)

(COOL!) Sing it baby
(COOL-COOL!) What's that spell?
(COOL-COOL-COOL!) That spells cool
(COOL-COOL-COOL!) That spells cool
