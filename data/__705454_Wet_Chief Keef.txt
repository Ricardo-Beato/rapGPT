18 ContributorsWet Lyrics
DP Beats

I get a nigga wet, get a bitch wet
I get a nigga wet, and I get a bitch wet
Say I get a nigga wet, and I get a bitch wet
Ayy, I get a nigga wet, and I get a nitch wet
If that nigga act up, ayy, then he gettin' wet
And that bitch she wanna fuck, 'cause she gettin' wet
If that nigga act up, ayy, then he gettin' wet
I said that bitch she wanna fuck, ayy, 'cause she gettin' wet

And that's wet and that's that, ayy
I just bought a new click-clack, and it's wet, ayy
Wet means that's that fuckin' thirty, ayy
It's that fucking thing with thirty in it, ayy
Click-clack, let that fuckin' thirty bang, ayy
My thot say she be havin' wet dreams
I'm somewhere dreaming, sippin' on a pint, ayy
You think you rollin' 'cause you sippin' on a K, ayy
Who that there? It's a bird, it's a plane, ayy
Pull up on the curb and then I slang, ayy
Now I got keys to the Phantom
Now I got some keys to my mansion, ayy
She wanna fuck me 'cause she say she wet
I'm smokin' lovely, feel like I'm the best
Boy, disrespect me, you gon' get wet
I'm flexin' on niggas like bench press
You might also like
I get a nigga wet, get a bitch wet
I get a nigga wet, and I get a bitch wet
Say I get a nigga wet, and I get a bitch wet
Ayy, I get a nigga wet, and I get a nitch wet
If that nigga act up, ayy, then he gettin' wet
And that bitch she wanna fuck, 'cause she gettin' wet
If that nigga act up, ayy, then he gettin' wet
I said that bitch she wanna fuck, ayy, 'cause she gettin' wet

I done got my dope wet, where the dope at?
Don't want my old hoes back, where the hoes at?
Where the thots at? I got the thot pack
It's a gamble with your life, where my pipe at?
He don't want to get wet, what kind of shit is that?
Nina gonna get you wet, 'cause she made for that
Run up in your house wet, ayy
A young nigga from the projects, ayy
That bitch ask where I'm going, I said, "To the top"
That bitch ask what I'm doing, I said, "Gettin' gwap"
That bitch wanna know too much, she wanna know my spot
She wanna know where I hang out, she wanna count my gwap
But she can't 'cause I don't trust no one, ayy
I got my gun, I ain't for no one
What you wearin', bitch? Wanna know where I'm at, bitch?
I got trust issues right along with my gat, bitch11Embed
