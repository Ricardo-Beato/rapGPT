From nothin' to somethin', bumpin' the system, gettin' it jumpin' (Jumpin')
All my ladies (Ladies), where you at? (Where you at?)

Shit is poppin' off (Off), it's gettin' wild
Uh, I'm at the party right now with some women (Hoes)
And the crowd, they go wild while I'm spittin' (Ayy)
Freestyle or a written, I'ma get this shit poppin'
Stayin' so fresh like I'm dressed for my coffin (Dressed for my coffin)
Pimping's not a option, it's a way of life (Life)
So tell my moms a couple honeys 'bout to stay the night (Haha)
And I hit the spot in the AM, blazin', then hazin'
Headin' to the stage to give a taste of amazin' (Amazin')
If you get your swag down pat, come and rock with me (Uh-oh)
And ladies, I'll be right here, come and talk to me (Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, ayy)

That's how it go down, y'all
Teenage wasteland
Party jumpin' all night, motherfuckers
We don't sleep, I ain't sleepin' in weeks
It's cool though, 'cause I've been wasted
Haha, what's up, Mom?Embed
