10 ContributorsMy Head Lyrics
Niggas hating every time I come around
Look at me at the red light, that's right
If you try me, you know you're dead, right?
She getting wetty in her leggings when I pull up in my foreign car
Hop out that bitch, it's looking like I write checks
I'm a young icy nigga, aren't I?
This blunt I'm smoking on is bigger than my head

Let me tell you about the blunt I'm smoking on
This shit hit so strong, I can't leave it alone
Let me tell you about your bitch I'm fucking on
She suck me like it's right, when she in her wrong
Let me tell you about this car that I'm gon' bend
When I let the top down, bitch I'm in the wind
Let me tell you about the money that I spend
Hit Louis Vuitton, after I hit Fendi
I just poured a whole pint and I will fuck your wife
I don't care if y'all was just married
Tell that bitch, "Stop staring at me"

You know these niggas hating every time I come around
Look at me at the red light, that's right
If you try me, you know you're dead, right?
She getting wetty in her leggings when I pull up in my foreign car
Hop out that bitch, it's looking like I write checks
I'm a young icy nigga, aren't I?
This blunt I'm smoking on is bigger than my head

You don't be sipping no drank (you don't sip no drank)
You don't be fucking the hoes (you don't fuck no thotties)
You don't be counting them Pros (you don't count on me)
I pour 12's, you pour up 4's (bitch, I pour a lot)
Girl know he is a lame ass nigga
A real nigga can't paint that picture
Baby girl, I don't want no relations
'Cause any nigga can roll that swisher
Who smokes the most dope?
Who's dodging these hoes?
Got cash, I need mo'
So I'm finding nemo

Niggas hating every time I come around
Look at me at the red light, that's right
If you try me, you know you're dead, right?
She getting wetty in her leggings when I pull up in my foreign car
Hop out that bitch, it's looking like I write checks
I'm a young icy nigga, aren't I?
This blunt I'm smoking on is bigger than my head1Embed
