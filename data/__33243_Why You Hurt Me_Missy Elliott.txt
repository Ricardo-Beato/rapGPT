11 ContributorsWhy You Hurt Me Lyrics
Yo (Yo, what's up?)
I know a somebody out that done had a
Nasty, nasty, nasty friend (That's right, I know what you talkin' about)
That wanna go around humping everybody (Right? Shit)
Can I get a "ho"? (Ho) Haha
You know what I'm saying? (Yeah, I know too)
So I'ma talk about this one I had (Say what?)
A few years ago (Uh-huh)

I had a friend named Cutie Tootie
Tootie turned tricks to get some Gucci, known as "Loosie Booty"
Truly, she was a freak in the evenin'
And if she wasn't teasin', then give me one reason
Why she do dat? Always knew dat she was hot as the nectar
Hector said he pecked her, disrespected her
'Cause he bang-bang, swangin' his dang-a-lang
Broke his back long range and make the ugly bitch sang

Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me? Tell me why, Lord
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me? Tell me why, Lord
Ooh, ooh
You might also like
Cutie Tootie, what a sight
And if she humped Ralph, she humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike
Tight is the way she wore her dresses
Has she learned her lesson from all the dick testing?
Now I'm guessing (Now I'm guessing) she's laying in a casket
In a yellow basket for a Gucci jacket
Daggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things
'Cause he made the ugly bitch sing

Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me? Tell me why, Lord
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me? Tell me why, Lord
Ooh, ooh

Tootie didn't know the facts of life
Staying up in clinics, Loosie Booty mad trife
Fell in, she got the heebie-jeebies
Quick to give you freebies underneath the staircase in Brooklyn
Neighbors out the window sure was lookin'
She greasy like chicken, I don't give a cotton-pickin'
She can do her thing
'Cause me and her don't hang, the ugly bitch sang
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me? Tell me why, Lord
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me? Tell me why, Lord
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me? Tell me why, Lord
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me? Tell me why, Lord
Ooh, ooh

Uh-huh
So you know what? This should be a lesson
For anybody that's hanging with somebody
That's dirty, nasty, stank
Once again, going around humping everybody
Everybody and anybody and anything
That's why you make the ugly bitch sang
Ooh, oohEmbed
