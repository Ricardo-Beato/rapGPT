30 ContributorsSo Many People Lyrics
Rolling Loud was amazing
Your performance kicked it off for me, like you don't understand
What is there not to like about Lil Yachty?
He's young, he's original, he's eccentric, he's wavy, he's stylish, he's intellectual, like he's the voice of a new generation, no doubt

So many people ask me how I do it
So many people ask me how I do it
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
So many people ask me how I do it
I don't know, I don't know
I just tell 'em I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
So many people ask me how I do it
So many people look to me for inspiration
I'm trying to figure out
I'm trying to figure out why
Cause I don't know
I just put both of my feet in the door
I did it two times, faster, these other niggas slow
I invest all my money, I'm never going broke
Oh, woah, cause I know the ropes
And I know the way to the top
And I stopped the drought
