Yeah
(J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League)

All this Fendi and Gucci is goofy
LV cancelled, you tell 'em to sue me
Rolex, AP, ain't shit, y'all follow
Need that, need us
Almighty Black dollar
Fuck them bottles ain’t Puff, it ain’t Jay’s
Ciroc, D'USSÉ, Bellaire, let's get paid
Rolls Royce, Bentley, ain't shit, y'all fell off
Need that, need us
Almighty Black dollar

Gucci don't like Black people
In my Boosie Badazz voice
Every young ghetto nigga dream
Brand new black Rolls Royce (Yeah)
Baby mama live in them projects
Baby wearin' brand new shoes (Shoes)
Still tryna find a way
Daddy ain't leave no clues (Ooh)
Dawg still doin' that timе
Then say, "Fuck them feds" (Fеds)
A nigga gon' get delayed (Boom)
Or he gon' get my bread (Yeah)
I ain't really got no credit but a nigga keep that cash (Hey)
Told 'em pre-Covid 19 (Teen)
Young nigga kept that mask (Let's go)
Designer, designer, I can't even spell it (Yeah)
Went broke just to wear it, you can even tell it
Jesus piece, I ain't prayed one time today (Hey)
But fuck it I'm ballin', what else can I say?

All this Fendi and Gucci is goofy
LV cancelled, you tell 'em to sue me
Rolex, AP, ain't shit, y'all follow
Need that, need us
Almighty Black dollar
Fuck them bottles ain’t Puff, it ain’t Jay’s
Ciroc, D'USSÉ, Bellaire, let's get paid
Rolls Royce, Bentley, ain't shit, y'all follow
Need that, need us
Almighty Black dollar (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

All I wanna do is see the real niggas be rewarded (Get it)
Fuck a bag, go and buy a whole city for my daughter (Get it)
Big homie, sixty-five, still doin' time, that's unfair (Mike)
What's the use climbin' to the mountain top, if you livin' on the ledge (Huh)
Shot the homie in the stomach, now he walking 'round with a shit bag (Huh)
Burnt down Black Wall Street, now it's time for the get back
Violate a young nigga probation for a piss test (Huh)
Got a hug from my mama, whispered in my ear we gon' beat this (Lord)
War ready (War ready), Black Power (Black Power)
Financial freedom (What?)
The Black dollar (Uh)
Slave labor (Nigga)
No love (Hoe love)
Back to bidness
Pay what you owe us (Maybach Music)
All this Fendi and Gucci is goofy
LV cancelled, you tell 'em to sue me
Rolex, AP, ain't shit, y'all follow
Need that, need us
Almighty Black dollar
Fuck them bottles ain’t Puff, it ain’t Jay’s
Ciroc, D'USSÉ, Bellaire, let's get paid
Rolls Royce, Bentley, ain't shit, y'all follow
Need that, need us
Almighty Black dollar
