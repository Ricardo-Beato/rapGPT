FADE IN: EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NIGHT
MONDAY 9:37 P.M.
Minutes after the assassination attempt, several limousines are driving down the bridge, heading back to the White House. Sirens are heard everywhere.
MAN 
We have no idea on the sweep of the perimeter at this time. We have no idea...
CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
President Bartlet and Special Agent Ron Butterfield are inside the moving limo.
RON
Zoey's secure.
BARTLET
Get her again.
RON
She wasn't hit sir. She's...
BARTLET
Get her on the radio, please!
RON
Sir, she can't talk right now.
BARTLET
Why can't she talk?
RON
She's vomiting in the car.
BARTLET
Why the hell?
RON
It happens, sir, we'll...
BARTLET
Why is she vomiting?
RON
It happens.  It could be shock.
BARTLET
Ron...
RON
She might have got an elbow on the stomach...
BARTLET
Is Gina with her?
RON
Gina put her in the car.
BARTLET
She's not with her?
RON
She's got two other agents in the car. She's got Mike and Fred, sir. They're going to have her back in the White House.
BARTLET
Why isn't Gina in the car?
RON
Gina put Zoey in the car then stayed behind for the ID agent. Mr. President, please.
Bartlet sighs and gasps for breath.
BARTLET
Is anybody dead back there?
RON
We don't know, we don't think so.
We see Ron's bloody hand, wrapped with some bandage.
BARTLET
What happened to your hand?!
RON
I got hit.
BARTLET
Oh God.  Coop, turn around, we gotta go to the hospital.
RON
We got to get you to the White House.
BARTLET
We're going to the hospital! Let's go!
RON
I have to put you inside the White House, Mr. President. This isn't something we discuss.
BARTLET
This is... my daughter is throwing up on the floor in the car behind us. You're losing blood by the liter, not to mention how many broken bones you got in your hand, but let's make sure that I'm tucked in bed before we do anything...
Blood has started coming out of the President's mouth.
RON
Mr. President?
Ron quickly checks the President for a possible injury. He feels blood near Bartlet's stomach.
RON
G.W.! Blue! Blue! Blue!
The limousine makes a quick 180-degree turn.
CUT TO: INT. THE NEWSEUM PARKING AREA - NIGHT
We hear sirens everywhere. The place is full of policemen, agents, paramedics and the people from the ropeline.
MEDIC 1
Left thigh, nerovasc intact.
MEDIC 2
She's stable. Give me some 4 by 4's.
Two medics are attending to C.J., who is obviously hurt and has her hand on her head.
C.J.
I'm really fine.
MEDIC 3
Scalp laceration, secondary to fall. 
C.J.
I hit my head on the ground.
MEDIC 4
No LOC?
C.J.
Somebody pulled me down.
MEDIC 4
Are you C.J. Cregg?
C.J.
Yeah!
MEDIC 4
Can you tell me what day it is?
C.J.
It's still Monday.
MEDIC 4
Ok, C.J., you're more shaken up than anything else, I don't think you're going to need stitches but you should find some place to lie down.
C.J.
Is the President dead?
MEDIC 4
I wouldn't know anything about that.
The medic has left. C.J. walks around a police car. She notices the glass door broken. From behind, Sam approaches.
SAM
You all right?
C.J.
What?
SAM
Are you all right?
C.J.
Yeah, where's the President?
SAM
He's on the way back to the White House, so is Zoey, they just put Leo in the car, you all right?
C.J.
Somebody pulled me down.
Gina runs by.
SAM
Gina?
GINA
I can't talk right now.
Gina approaches an agent.
GINA
Gina Toscano.
TOMMY CHO
Tommy Cho.
GINA
Are you the I.D. agent?
CHO
Yeah.
GINA
Two shooters in that window, we got them both from the roof, but there was a signal.
CHO
There was somebody on the ground?
GINA
White male, 20, 25, maybe 5-10.
CHO
What else?
GINA
He was wearing a baseball cap.
CHO
What kind of cap?
GINA
Maybe it got knocked off from the crowd.
CHO
What kind of cap?!
GINA
I don't know.
CHO
 Fix the perimeter, close the airports, shut them down, I want the Harbor Patrol and the Coast Guard.
AGENT
You got it.
MAN
Stevie! Paul!
Somewhere near, Toby is looking around for Josh.
TOBY
Josh! Josh!
He spots Charlie.
TOBY
Hey, Charlie, are you okay?
CHARLIE
Yeah.
TOBY
Have you seen Josh?
CHARLIE
He got in the car with Leo.
TOBY
No, he didn't. Shanahan got in with Leo. Josh didn't get in the car.
They part ways. A woman shouts somewhere.
WOMAN
Can we get some help?
TOBY
Yeah. Stay right there.
Toby continues to look around for Josh. He spots the back of his head behind a ledge, away from everyone else. He was sitting beside it. Toby runs to him.
TOBY
Josh! Didn't you hear me shouting for you? I didn't know where the hell you...
As Toby faces his friend, Josh stares at him, gasping for breath, while holding his
stomach. A huge amount of blood has come out from his chest, to his shirt and all over his hands. Toby's face changes.
TOBY
I need a... I need a doctor! I need help!
C.J. and Sam heard him and starts to run towards them. Josh suddenly slumps over, his bloody hands still on his gunshot wound.
SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE
FADE IN: INT. GEORGE WASHINGTON HOSPITAL - NIGHT
It's a quiet night in the hospital lobby. Several patients are sitting in the waiting section. Two nurses meet.
NURSE 2
Hey.
NURSE 1
Hey. Your best friend's back.
The other nurse looks to the waiting section. She notices a familiar patient.
NURSE 2
Thank you for that.
She walks over to a pregnant woman.
NURSE 2
Cynthia. Hi. You can follow me.
Cynthia and her nurse walk away. We follow the first nurse as she walks to the reception desk. Another nurse comes.
NURSE 1
She's been in twice a week for the last three weeks because she can't feel the baby kick. I should just tell her ma'am, wait till eight months, the kid'll be doing the Macarena.
In the meantime, this is an emergency room.
NURSE 3
Did you really say that?
NURSE 1
No, I'm saying I should've said that.
The other nurse walks away as a phone rings. The first nurse answers the local phone in the desk.
NURSE 1
Emergency room.
Nobody there. Another phone continues to ring. The nurse hangs up and quietly answers a red phone attached to the wall.
NURSE 1
Station One.
CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet is now gasping for breath. Ron is shouting on the phone.
RON
We're coming in!
NURSE 1 
I copy that. Is this a drill?
RON
No!
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
Sirens are heard from a distance.
NURSE 1
 The thing is I have a few patients, not many but I do have a couple of kids
with alcohol poisoning. We're expecting more in a bit, so if this is a drill, I'd just as soon ...
The sirens get louder. The nurse looks to the entranceway where several cars and ambulances have already arrived. She hangs up the red phone and picks up the local phone. She punches a button for the P.A.
NURSE 1
Trauma One. Trauma One, Blue! Blue! Trauma One, Blue! Go!
Nurses and doctors around her start to get busy. A Secret Service Agent enters and approaches the nurse.
AGENT 1
You got priorities?
NURSE 1
No priorities.
AGENT 1
We're gonna need a hand. They're going to the memorial.
The nurse turns to the waiting patients.
NURSE 1
Okay, people. I need you to follow this man to the van that's waiting...
The patients hurry outside as we follow two agents.
AGENT 2
Get the south side clear. There are two backdoors and a loading dock. Put two units in the scaffolding, and get some light out there!
The agent comes in a room as DR. KELLER comes out.
DR. KELLER
Get me an ultrasound and a crash cart.
We close in on another agent.
AGENT 3
Eagle's two minutes away!
CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT
Reporters surround Vice President Hoynes in the lobby. He is holding a jersey while posing for the cameras.
CAMERAMAN
Mr. Vice President, could you hold the shirt up a little bit?
HOYNES
Yeah, one of my roommates at S.M.U. was Drew Harper. Anybody know that name?
WOMAN
'72?
HOYNES
'72 Olympics in Munich. Well, I played against him at a pick-up game while on the quad, and I thought I'd stuff him with an overhead slam. He sent that ball back at my face like I talked about his sister.
The reporters laugh. Hoynes approaches a man and shakes his hand.
HOYNES
Coach, I want to congratulate you and your team in the NCAA on a great season last year. I know you had four starters returning so I'm confident...
Several Secret Service Agents come storming inside. Hoynes gets worried.
AGENT
Excuse me! Everyone stay where you are. Mr. Vice President, would you come with us please?
The agents surround Hoynes and escort him outside as the reporters stand puzzled.
CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT
Agents cut in a hallway and meet with Abbey, who is rushing down the hall also with other agents.
AGENT 1
Mrs. Bartlet.
ABBEY
Is he conscious?
AGENT 2
He's conscious and they're moving him to pre-op. He was hit in the side, entry and exit.
They go outside, where a car is waiting.
AGENT 2
We're on our way.
ABBEY
What about Zoey?
AGENT 1
They got her in the car. She's cool. She's on her way to G.W.
AGENT 2
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
The cars screech as they drive away.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Nurses and paramedics are hurriedly pushing a gurney carrying President Bartlet. We see blood on the side of the his shirt as he groans and tries to catch his breath. Ron is nearby.
NURSE 1
He was shot in the abdomen. It's an entry and exit wound.
NURSE 2
B.P. 134 over 78. Pulse is 108. What's his pulse ox?
PARAMEDIC
98.
Dr. Keller tries to talk to the President.
DR. KELLER
Mr. President, I'm Dr. Keller. I'm the trauma surgeon on duty. The exit wound is a good indication we like your vital signs.
BARTLET
I swear to God if I don't speak to my daughter in the next five minutes, I'm gonna attack someone.
RON
She's on her way.
They enter a trauma room.
BARTLET
 This guy's got about seven broken bones in his hand, by the way. If somebody wants to give him an aspirin or something...
NURSE
We're there.
The gurney is stopped, and the nurses and doctors hurriedly prepare for the treatment.
DR. KELLER
Okay, sir, we're just gonna get you stabilized.
BARTLET
Listen, I want you to wait as long as you can before you give me the anesthesia. I need to speak to Leo McGarry before you give me the anesthesia.
RON
He's on his way as well.
NURSE
I need to ask you some questions, sir. Do you have any medical conditions?
BARTLET
Well... I've been shot.
CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
It's a quiet night in the West Wing as Margaret and Mrs. Landingham meet in the hallway.
MARGARET
Good evening, Mrs. Landingham.
MRS. LANDINGHAM
Good evening, Margaret.
MARGARET
The President's not back yet?
MRS. LANDINGHAM
I imagine he's schmoozing the rope line.
They enter the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE. Margaret immediately notices a SPECIAL REPORT on the television screen.
MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know, he said he's coming straight back, but he can't resist a ropeline. Never has.
Oh, he'll complain, but he just can't resist it. I remember a time in the Governor's mansion. It was about ten years ago...
MARGARET
 Mrs. Landingham.
MRS. LANDINGHAM
More. Maybe 12.
MARGARET
Mrs. Landingham!
Margaret turns up the volume as Mrs. Landingham watches with her. A newscaster appears on the monitor.
NEWSCASTER
Good evening. We are getting reports that multiple gunshots were fired at President Bartlet as he was leaving a public event in Rosslyn, Virginia. The shots were fired approximately seven minutes ago...
Mrs. Landingham runs out of the office before the newscaster could finish.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
Zoey walks inside and sees her father in pain. A look of fear is on her face. The nurses are still very busy.
ZOEY
Dad?
BARTLET
I'm okay.
ZOEY
Daddy?!
BARTLET
They didn't hit anything. They're just gonna look around and make sure.
ZOEY
Are you-- are you in a lot of pain?
BARTLET
No.
ZOEY
Are you lying?
BARTLET
Yeah, 'cause I want these guys to tell reporters that I was brave and joking around.
ZOEY
You are brave. You were so good tonight, dad.
BARTLET
 Honey, I'm fine. I'm just so happy to see you.
ZOEY
Mom's on her way.
BARTLET
Mom's gonna be pretty pissed.
ZOEY
Yeah.
All of a sudden, Leo comes storming in the trauma room, a troubling look in his face as he looks at Bartlet. He notices Zoey beside him.
LEO
How you doing, kid?
ZOEY
I'm fine.
BARTLET
She booted all over the back of her car. You know they're gonna bill me for that.
LEO
Yeah.
BARTLET
Honey, do me a favor, will you?
ZOEY
Yeah. I'll step outside. I'll go wait for mom.
BARTLET
Tell her not to frighten the doctors. I'll see you in a couple hours.
ZOEY
I love you.
BARTLET
I love you too, hon.
Zoey exits. Leo walks closer to Bartlet.
BARTLET
Anybody killed back there?
LEO
The two shooters. They got them through the window.
BARTLET
Anybody in the crowd?
LEO
There were some injuries. They're coming right now.
BARTLET
What about our people?
LEO
C.J. hit her head on the ground, but other than that...
BARTLET
 Get the cabinet together and the Security Council. Tell Jerome to suspend trading on the stock exchange.
LEO
Yeah.
BARTLET
Do we know who the shooters were?
LEO
No.
BARTLET
I'm gonna be under anesthesia for a couple hours.
LEO
It'll be fine.
BARTLET
You know what I'm talking about, right?
LEO
I'll talk to Abbey.
DR. KELLER
Sir, it's time.
BARTLET
 Hey. Come here.
He motions for Leo to come closer. Leo leans his head near him. Bartlet, looking to comfort his best friend, kisses Leo gently on the cheek.
BARTLET
It's okay.
LEO
I'll see you in a few hours, Mr. President.
Bartlet sighs as Leo exits.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL LOBBY - NIGHT
Zoey is talking to a woman.
WOMAN
Okay, Zoey. I'll find out.
The woman leaves. Abbey comes running inside and sees her daughter.
ABBEY
Oh. You all right?
ZOEY
Yeah.
They hug tight.
ZOEY
And Dad's making jokes.
ABBEY
Good ones, or...?
ZOEY
No.
ABBEY
Okay.
Leo approaches, along with Dr. Keller.
LEO
Abbey. This is Dr. Keller.
ABBEY
Oh, yes. We spoke in the car.
DR. KELLER
Hello.
ABBEY
What's his PO2?
DR. KELLER
It's good. It's a hundred.
ABBEY
You're gonna do a laperoscopy?
DR. KELLER
Yeah. We want to make sure the peritoneum's intact.
ABBEY
Mm-hmm. Who's the anesthesiologist?
DR. KELLER
Dr. Lee.
ABBEY
 You'll be okay honey?
ZOEY
Yeah.
Abbey walks away.
CUT TO: INT. TRAUMA ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Just outside Bartlet's trauma room. DR. LEE is standing. Abbey approaches him.
ABBEY
Dr. Lee?
DR. LEE
Dr. Bartlet. I hope they told you that it's looking very good.
ABBEY
There are 14 people in the world who know this, including the vice President, the chief of staff, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. You are going to be the fifteenth. Seven years ago, my husband was diagnosed with a relapsing/remitting course
of M.S. When all this is over, tell the press, don't tell the press. It's entirely up to you.
Abbey immediately exits.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Leo is strolling along the busy hospital. He spots Gina standing by a doorway. He puts his arm up and leans it in the wall.
LEO
You all right?
GINA
Yeah.
LEO
Was there someone on the ground?
GINA
There was a signal. I couldn't give a description.
LEO
Did they close the airports?
GINA
And Union Station. We've got troopers on the bridges and 300 field agents working Rosslyn. I can't tell them what they're looking for.
A faint sound of a siren is heard.
LEO
You got the girl in the car, Gina.
GINA
It's right in front of my face.
LEO
Look...
The sirens get louder as paramedics and nurses comes in the hospital with another patient.
NURSE
Gunshot wound! No exit!
PARAMEDIC
He's got decreased breath sounds in the left. Pulse ox is 92 on 15 liters.
Leo comes running out the door with several nurses. C.J. and Toby are running beside the gurney.
C.J.
It's Josh!
NURSE
I've got the hemocue.
LEO
Josh!
PARAMEDIC
Trauma panel, serial crits...
LEO
What happened?
TOBY
He was behind us.
PARAMEDIC
Single gunshot wound, left fifth intercostal space.
We hear Sam somewhere.
SAM
Josh, I'm here!
Josh has an oxygen mask in his mouth. He speaks groggily.
JOSH
I shouldn't be at this meeting.
NURSE
Trauma One's ready.
DOCTOR
I need a chest tube tray, 32 French.
JOSH
Senator...
LEO
Tell me what's happening!
DOCTOR
I don't have time!
They come inside TRAUMA ONE.
JOSH
I shouldn't be at this meeting.
NURSE
Pulse ox, 88.
JOSH
I need to get to New Hampshire.
Sam is now beside Josh.
SAM
You went to New Hampshire. We both did. You came and got me.
DOCTOR
On my count. One. Two. Three!
We see an OVERHEAD SHOT of Josh being lifted onto another bed. Everything around him switches into SLOW MOTION.
DOCTOR
Josh, a bullet collapsed your lung. We're putting in a tube to re-expand it.
NURSE 1
We've got blood in the theroseal.
NURSE 2
Over a liter and out.
NURSE 1
He's bradying down.
DOCTOR
Okay, tube him now.
NURSE 1
80 E.T. Tube?
A FAINT VOICE 
Social Security...
DOCTOR
Cricoid Pressure...
ANOTHER VOICE 
Senator.
As Josh loses consciousness in the trauma room, we --
FADE TO WHITE.
We find out that the voices are from Josh and Hoynes.
HOYNES 
Social Security is...
JOSH 
Senator.
HOYNES 
Social Security is the black hole...
JOSH 
Senator.
HOYNES 
Social Security--
JOSH 
Senator.
HOYNES 
Social Security--
JOSH 
Sir.
FADE IN: INT. THE SENATE BUILDING, A CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
An OVERHEAD SHOT from the chandelier in a conference room. Scanning the crowd, Senator John Hoynes of Texas holds a meeting with his staff, including Josh, from THREE YEARS EARLIER.
HOYNES
Social Security is the black hole of national politics.
JOSH
Yes.
HOYNES
Josh was cutting me off because he knew I was gonna say that. He knew I was gonna say that because I have said it, what?
JOSH
A few hundred times, sir.
HOYNES
It is the black hole of national politics, and I would just assume not get lost in it 13 weeks before the New Hampshire primary. It is the third rail. You step on it, and you die.

JOSH
Of the 537 federal election officials, there are 30 who put their names on Social Security reform legislation, and you're one of them. Why not say so?
MARK
He will say so. Just not now.
JOSH
Mark, 400 billion dollars. Social Security represents one-fourth of the federal budget, and it's gonna be bankrupt in exactly 17 years. Right around the time you're going to check your mailbox, half of the elderly population will be living in poverty. This now, qualifies as a priority, and running for President of the United States not putting Social Security front and center is like running for President of the Walt Disney Corporation by saying you're gonna fix the rides at Epcot.
MARK
We're gonna get to Social Security, Josh. It's a long campaign. For now, we focus on the tax cuts.
CANDY
It's what magicians call 'misdirection.'
JOSH
Really? 'Cause it's what the rest of us call bull--
HOYNES
Knock it off! I have a vote.  The rest of you should stay here and work on the ethanol tax credit. Josh, come with me, would you?
CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Hoynes is walking with Josh.
HOYNES
You don't seem to be having a very good time lately.
JOSH
I don't think the point of this is for me to have...
HOYNES
I'm saying you've been pissed off at every meeting for a month.
They stop walking.
JOSH
Senator, you're the prohibitive favorite to be the Democratic Party's nominee for President. You have 58 million dollars in war chest with no end in sight, and... I don't know what we're for.
HOYNES
Josh.
JOSH
I don't know what we're for, and I don't know what we're against. Except we seem to be for winning and against somebody else winning.
HOYNES
It's a start.
JOSH
Senator...
HOYNES
Josh, we are going to run a good campaign. You're gonna be very proud of it. When we get to the White House, you're gonna play a big role. In the meantime, cheer up, and
get off my ass about Social Security. I've got a vote.
Hoynes walks away, leaving Josh in the hallway.
CUT TO: INT. SENATE BUILDING OFFICES - CONTINUOUS
Josh wanders around the place. A familiar voice calls to him -- Leo McGarry.
LEO
Josh.
JOSH
Mr. Secretary!
LEO
I hope you don't mind I didn't make an appointment. I'm trying to fly under the radar a little.
JOSH
Of course, I don't mind, but the senator just went down for the 404 vote.
LEO
It's probably the annual vote override to veto on the resolution to ship nuclear wastes to Nevada.
JOSH
Yeah.
LEO
It won't pass.
JOSH
No kidding.
LEO
Actually, I came to see you.
JOSH
Really?
LEO
Yeah.
JOSH
What can I do for you?
LEO
You mind if we take a walk?
JOSH
Sure.
CUT TO: EXT. THE CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY
Just outside the building, near the Washington Monument, Josh and Leo are walking.
LEO
I heard your dad was in the hospital again.
JOSH
Yeah. They put... they got it all this time.
LEO
Is he taking it easy?
JOSH
No. He goes to the office at seven in the morning and goes home at eight every night. On the weekends, he cleans the gutters and yells at the squirrels.
LEO
Why does he yell at the squirrels?
JOSH
'Cause they eat the seeds out of the bird feeder.
LEO
You know, they make a thing now...
They stop walking.
JOSH
He knows, but he prefers to admonish them. But, listen, I-I need to get back to this meeting.
LEO
Josh, I'd like you to come to Nashua, New Hampshire Thursday night and hear Jed Bartlet speak.
JOSH
I work for Senator Hoynes.
LEO
Yeah.
JOSH
Mr. Secretary...
LEO
I'm not in the Cabinet anymore, Josh. Call me Leo.
JOSH
Look, Hoynes has the nomination sewn up.
LEO
Yeah.
JOSH
And if Bartlet's looking to be Treasury Secretary or a slot at the Convention, this really isn't...
LEO
Come to Nashua Thursday night.
JOSH
Why?
LEO
Because that's what sons do for old friends of their fathers. 
JOSH
Mr. Secretary...
LEO
Leo. 
JOSH
Leo, the-the Democrats aren't gonna nominate another liberal academic former governor from New England. I mean, we're dumb, but we're not that dumb.
LEO
 Nah. I think we're exactly that dumb.
Leo heads on his way, leaving Josh puzzled. After a moment, Josh pulls out his cell phone and dials a number as he walks up the stairs of the Capitol Building.
JOSH
 Yeah, uh, Janet. Uh, I need you to set up some plane tickets to New York. Uh, probably to Boston too...
The camera PANS UP to the top of the Capitol Building.
FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
FADE IN: INT. A LAW FIRM - DAY
	GAGE WHITNEY PACE
	MIDTOWN MANHATTAN
	THREE YEARS EARLIER
Sam is in a meeting with several lawyers, including his boss MR. GAGE,
MR. LOCH and
MR. CAMERON.
MR. GAGE 
All in, showroom floor to your garage, 18 million dollars.
MR. CAMERON
18 million dollars is a cheap price, isn't it?
MR. GAGE
Yes, it is. What you're happy about isn't the price. It's the structure of the deal.
MR. CAMERON
Well, how do you figure that?
MR. GAGE
Sam's going to tell you about it. Sam.
Sam looks up quickly.
SAM
Hmm?
MR. GAGE
Structure versus cost?
SAM
Uh, yeah. What Jack means is, if you were getting the tankers for a buck 85 and trading stamps it would still be a bad deal if we didn't limit your liability.
MR. CAMERON
And you did that?
SAM
We did.
MR. CAMERON
How?
SAM
The same way we do with any other asset acquisition. Create a separate corporation for each one of them, then mortgage the boats, top to bottom.
MR. CAMERON
Ships.
SAM
I'm sorry?
MR. CAMERON
Oil tankers aren't boats, they're ships.
SAM
Mr. Cameron, you want me to buy the boats, you're not asking me to be the first mate, right?
MR. CAMERON
No.
SAM
You want to finance the tankers a hundred percent so that if litigation does penetrate the liability shield we've set up for you there are no real assets at the end of the line, just debt. You're judgment proof. Let me run back to my office and get the tax figures while David and Rita talk about IMO regulations. 
CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Sam walks by the corridor where a secretary meets him.
SECRETARY
Sam. There's a guy waiting in your office who said he's a friend of yours.
SAM
What's his name?
SECRETARY
Josh Lyman?
SAM
 Seriously?
SECRETARY
Yeah.
Sam enters his office, where Josh is standing.
SAM
Hey!
JOSH
How you doing?
They hug.
SAM
Hey, you look fit.
JOSH
You made partner?
SAM
Next month. Listen, I'm hungry. You want to go grab a hot dog or something?
JOSH
It's 9:30 in the morning.
SAM
Yeah, they'll be fresh. Come on.
JOSH
Okay.
CUT TO: INT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY
Sam and Josh are walking away from a hot dog stand.
JOSH
Yeah, I was going to call before I came here, but then the strangest thing
happened.
Sam throws out his hot dog wrapper.
SAM
What?
JOSH
I forgot the name of your firm.
SAM
Gage Whitney.
JOSH
Yeah.
SAM
You couldn't remember Gage Whitney.
JOSH
I know.
SAM
Second biggest firm in New York?
JOSH
I know.
SAM
Did the Shearson deal--
JOSH
Yeah.
SAM
Bought Transcom.
JOSH
I really do know Gage Whitney. I'm saying, I'm just, um, I'm um, having a brain problem.
SAM
What are you doing in town?
JOSH
I'm on my way to Nashua.
SAM
What's in Nashua?
JOSH
Ah, a waste of time. Listen. You know why I'm here.
SAM
You want me to quit my job and come work for Hoynes?
JOSH
He's gonna win, Sam.
SAM
So what do you need me for?
JOSH
A better campaign. Come do some speech writing.
SAM
Lisa and I are getting married in September.
They stop.
JOSH
 Ah.
SAM
 Yeah.
JOSH
Okay. Listen, I should go, I got to go. I should let you--
SAM
I got to get back to this thing.
JOSH
It's good seeing you.
SAM
It's good seeing you. I miss you.
They start to walk in separate directions.
JOSH
Hey, congratulations on that partnership.
SAM
Josh!
They turn and face each other.
SAM
Hoynes. He's not the real thing, is he?
JOSH
See, that-the thing you gotta know about Hoynes is-- 
SAM
It's okay.
JOSH
I-I'm saying--
SAM
Josh.  What are you doing?
JOSH
I don't know. What are you doing?
SAM
Protecting oil companies from litigation.
Josh nods.
SAM
They're our client. They don't lose legal protection because they make a lot of money.
JOSH
I can't believe no one ever wrote a folk song about that.
Sam grins.
JOSH
If I see the real thing in Nashua, should I tell you about it?
SAM
You won't have to.
JOSH
Why?
SAM
You've got a pretty bad poker face.
JOSH
Okay.  Take it easy.
SAM
Okay.
Sam turns around and plows into a woman before we--
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL - PRESENT
Sam has just rammed into a nurse.
SAM
I'm sorry.
NURSE
That's okay.
SAM
I'm sorry. It's just--
A man in a suit, who we'll assume is a doctor, approaches Abbey.
DOCTOR
Dr. Bartlet.
<><>
ABBEY
Yes.
DOCTOR
The President's going to be fine.
ABBEY
Oh. 
DOCTOR
You can see him in the recovery room in about two hours.
The two of them start walking.
ABBEY
Thank you. No organ damage?
DOCTOR
No ma'am, and blood loss was minimal. Dr. Keller was able to visualize the entire abdomen, and he's secure with the diagnostic of the laparoscopy.
Abbey stops and turns.
ABBEY
What about Josh?
DOCTOR
The bullet lacerated his pulmonary artery.
ABBEY
Can they try a Gortex graft?
DOCTOR
No. They're going to have to stay in and try to repair the artery primarily.
ABBEY
Thank you.
Abbey enters the waiting room and addresses everyone inside.
ABBEY
The President's going to be fine. The bullet seems to have gone out of it's way not to hit anything. Now, here's what's happening with Josh...
A Secret Service Agent closes the door to the waiting room.
CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Leo and a man in uniform, Jack, are on a TV monitor starting to enter the room.
LEO
Thank you.
JACK
What do you know?
LEO
He'll be out of surgery in about two hours. Fitzwallace is on a plane?
JACK
He was on his way to Manila. They turned around, and he'll be back in about four hours.
LEO
We've got him by phone?
JACK
Yeah.
They enter the situation room full of busy military men.
LEO
Good evening.
MILITARY MEN
Good evening, Mr. McGarry.
LEO
Where's the National Security Advisor?
JACK
She's on her way. So's the Vice President.
NANCY McNALLY, the National Security Advisor, enters, wearing a gold evening gown.
NANCY McNALLY
Good evening everybody. Mike, could you have somebody send over some clothes from my office, please? I look like an idiot.
MIKE
Yes ma'am.
Nancy sits down.
LEO
Nancy, you've seen the KH-10 pictures?
NANCY
Yeah.
LEO
And you know what they mean?
NANCY
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Hoynes enters the room.
NANCY
Good evening, Mr. Vice President.
HOYNES
Good evening Nancy. Leo.
LEO
Jack.
Hoynes pauses at the head of the table.
JACK
Ten Hut!
Hoynes looks up, a little surprised as the people in the room stand.
HOYNES
No, as you were. It's-it's okay.  Bobby, your report on domestic activity?
BOBBY
Yes, sir. There's not much. Air traffic control was down for 22 minutes at Logan. City bank computers were off-line for a little more than an hour, and the lights went out for seven minutes at the Delta Center.
HOYNES
Somebody tell me-these shooters, they didn't have a wallet on them? They didn't have a driver's license?
ARMY MAN
They didn't have anything on them, Mr. Vice President. They knew we were
gonna get them
through the window.
HOYNES
If this signal guy isn't in custody in one hour, I'm going to federalize the Virginia and Maryland National Guards.
NANCY
It's worth mentioning that at this moment we do not know the whereabouts of about a half dozen cell leaders, including bin Laden, but that's not my concern right now.
HOYNES
What is your concern?
NANCY
Can we look at the KH-10's?
LEO
I've seen them. I'm not worried about it.
NANCY
Leo, these images show a sudden build-up of front-line Republican guard units along the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers.
LEO
The build-up isn't sudden. They do it every couple of months.
NANCY
And they're moving south. Now thirteen hours ago they shot down an F-117 in the No-Fly. The rescue mission invaded their airspace with armed M-50 Pave Hawks. And my
recommendation would be that the President order Fitzwallace to put the 32nd tactical on ready alert and take us to Defcon 4.
LEO
The President is under general anesthesia right now. If he weren't I'm sure he'd be comforted to know that RDF can put Marines on the ground in 36 hours.
NANCY
We may not have 36 hours.
LEO
The Iraqi Republican guard can't find their car keys in 36 hours.
NANCY
Look at the pictures, Mr. Vice-President. I think they've found 'em.
Hoynes pauses for several moments.
HOYNES
Nancy, we're gonna follow Leo for the moment.
LEO
Jack, what's the best way to get a message to Iraq?
JACK
The king of Jordan.
LEO
All right.
ARMY MAN
Leo. What do you want the message to be?
LEO<>
Don't mess with us tonight.
CUT TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
The same doctor enters the waiting room where Sam, Toby, C.J., Charlie and the rest of the staff are waiting.
DOCTOR
Uh, excuse me.
Everyone looks up.
DOCTOR
We can't make you very comfortable here, and Josh's procedure is likely to take 12 to 14 hours. So--
Donna enters the room.
DONNA
I'm sorry, they told me I should come back here? I'm sorry. Is there word on the President?
C.J.
The President's going to be fine.
DONNA
Oh, thank God.  Oh, thank God, that's the best news I've ever heard. I got here as fast as I could. I had a hard time getting in. I had-I had to find an agent who knew me,
and I was shaking. I was just -- I didn't know--
TOBY<>
Donna.  Josh was hit.
DONNA
Hit with what?
TOBY
He was shot--in the chest.
C.J.
He's in surgery right now.
DONNA
I don't understand. I don't understand, is -- is it serious?
TOBY
Yes, it's critical. The bullet collapsed his lung and damaged a major artery.
Donna looks very shocked.
DOCTOR
I was just saying, we can't make you very comfortable here, and the procedure's likely to take 12 to 14 hours. We won't know anything until morning. I'm sure there are things
you're supposed to be attending to right now, so if you like we can stay in contact with your homes and offices throughout the night.
As the doctor exits, Donna sinks into a chair and stares into
space. C.J. begins to rub her back. Sam tears a piece of paper out of his notebook hands it to C.J.
C.J.
Leo's gonna meet with the leadership in ten minutes. When he's done, I'll talk to the press.
CHARLIE
I'm gonna go back to the residence and pick up some things for the President.
Charlie and C.J. stand up and exit the room. Donna is still sitting and staring into space.
FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO

ACT THREE
FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT
C.J is doing a briefing, but she looks somewhat dazed, like she's still in shock.
REPORTERS
C.J.!
C.J.
Yeah.
REPORTER 1
When can we talk to the medical team?
C.J.
Dr. Keller, the head surgeon, and Admiral Jarvis, the President's personal physician,
will be debriefing you in a few hours.
REPORTERS
C.J.!
C.J.
Danny!
DANNY
Has there been any discussion of the 25th amendment?
C.J.
No--
REPORTERS
C.J.!
DANNY
 Why not?
C.J.
What?
DANNY
Why hasn't there been any discussion of the 25th amendment?
C.J.
I'll get back to you on that.
REPORTERS
C.J.!
REPORTER 2
Do you have anything on the identity of the shooters?
C.J.
I'm sorry?
REPORTER 2
Do you have anything on the identity of the shooters?
C.J.
No.
REPORTER 2
Are you aware that the AP has been saying that two bodies were brought out of the building?
C.J.
I don't have anything for you on that.
REPORTER 2
Are you also aware that the AP is also saying there is now a massive manhunt underway for a suspected third accomplice?
C.J.
I don't have anything for you on that either.
REPORTERS
C.J.!
REPORTER 3
Why does the AP know more than you do?
C.J.
I don't believe the AP knows more than I do; I just believe they're willing to tell you more.
Carol leans over and tells C.J. something.
C.J.
One more question!
REPORTERS
C.J.!
C.J.
Arthur!
ARTHUR
In previous administrations the President entered and exited buildings under a tent or canopy, the Secret Service wanting to limit visibility in the open air. Can you tell me why these precautions weren't taken for President Bartlet or at least not
tonight?
C.J.
It's policy not to comment on security procedures.
ARTHUR
Well, C.J., if you can't answer the most straightforward question then what can you tell us?
C.J.
I'm sorry?
ARTHUR
What do you know? What can you tell us?
C.J. has her hand on her neck and looks dazed.
C.J.
 There'll be another briefing in an hour and a half. Hopefully we'll know more then.
The reporters groan as she announces this, and some try calling her.
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
C.J. and Carol are walking down the hall towards C.J.'s office.
C.J.
 What's that supposed to mean since you can't answer my question?
CAROL
You scratched your neck.
C.J.
What?
CAROL
You have scratch on the side of your neck.
C.J.
I lost my necklace. It must have come off when.
CAROL
When what?
C.J.
Somebody pushed me down.
Danny comes up behind them as they turn the corner into a HALLWAY.
DANNY
C.J.?
Carol heads off while Danny and C.J. walk through the communications area still towards her office.
C.J.
What?
DANNY
I'm sorry, I don't want to be a reporter for a few minutes but you've gotta answer my question.
C.J.
What was the question?
DANNY
The President's been under anesthetic for more than an hour. He's probably gonna be on a morphine drip. Without the 25th, who's in charge?
C.J.
The Vice President, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Secretary of Defense, one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House Chief of Staff.
DANNY
You just listed six people! Who's in charge?
C.J.
The Canadiens.
DANNY
C.J....
C.J.
You understand I'm talking about the hockey team.
DANNY
Look.
C.J.
Just... give me a little time.
Danny nods. C.J. walks away.
CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Nancy and Leo are arguing. C.J. and Toby are with them.
LEO
Fitzwallace agrees with me, Nancy. Upgrade our DefCon posture and the whole world's gonna wake up.
NANCY
The world's already awake Leo! Look at the TV. Look out the window! They had more than one shooter. We think they had a guy on the ground. If they had one, there's no reason to
believe they didn't have more than one. Somebody had to get them into that office. This was not a lonely guy who lived with his cats. There was a plan and one of the things we have to assume is that we're under attack right now.
STAFFER
Which is why the Vice President should order the 32nd tactical on a ready alert and take us to DefCon 4.
LEO
Counsel's office isn't sure he can do that.
TOBY
Why not?
LEO
He never signed a letter.
TOBY
What letter?
NANCY
Customarily if the President is going to be under anesthetic.
TOBY
He's gotta sign a letter giving the Vice President power?
NANCY
Absent of the 25th, the Constitution doesn't give it to him unless the President is dead.
TOBY
He's hemorrhaging and he's supposed to draft a memo?
NANCY
Yeah.
C.J.
I'm getting questions from Danny Concannon on it.
NANCY
It gets more complicated if you'd read section 202 the National Securities Act of 1947.
C.J.
Let's assume I haven't.
NANCY
It says the Secretary of Defense will be the principal assistant to the President on all matters relating to national security.
C.J.
And what does 'principal assistant' mean?
NANCY
It doesn't specify.
TOBY
Of course it wouldn't, 'cause that's an area of federal law where he'd want to have as much ambiguity as possible.
NANCY
Yeah.
TOBY
Excuse me. 
C.J.
I'm gonna go back to the hospital.
LEO
I'll be there in a little bit.
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Toby is entering something onto a handheld device as he walks. C.J. catches up with him.
TOBY
Try and hold Danny off for a few hours until the Counsel's office tells us where we are.
C.J.
Okay.
TOBY
You scratched your neck.
C.J.
What?
TOBY
Your neck.
C.J.
Yeah, it's where my necklace. Listen, Toby, I've been getting some questions about the canopy the Secret Service used to use for outdoor entrances and exits.
They stop walking.
TOBY
Who asked you?
C.J.
It was. Arthur Leeds, then a couple of others stopped me.
TOBY
Okay.
They start walking again.
C.J.
We don't comment on security procedures.
TOBY
Yeah.
C.J.
So I don't think I'll have to answer that question.
TOBY
Yeah.
C.J.
Okay.
TOBY
I'll see you at the hospital.
C.J.
Yeah.
C.J. walks away. Toby goes into the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.
TOBY
I need section 202 of the National Securities Act of 1947.
He notices Ginger, who is standing by her desk.
TOBY
Hey Ginger. I didn't know you were here.
GINGER
I just... I turned on the T.V.
Her hands are shaking. She looks very upset and scared.
TOBY
It's okay.  Come here.
He gives her a big hug.
TOBY
It's okay.
GINGER
I'm sorry.
TOBY
You all right?
GINGER
Yeah.
TOBY
Ready to go to work?
GINGER
 Yeah.
Toby enters his office and Ginger goes to a desk.
MAN 
You want another one of those?
TOBY
What?
GINGER
I didn't say anything.
CUT TO: INT. A DARK BAR - DAY
BARTENDER
You want another one of those?
TOBY
Yeah.
	HANK'S TAVERN
	NASHUA, NH
	THREE YEARS EARLIER
Toby and a woman are sitting at the bar. Toby looks pretty drunk and is smoking a cigar. The bartender pours some more of Toby's drink.
WOMAN
I gotta tell you.
TOBY
Yeah.
WOMAN
I didn't even know Bartlet was running.
TOBY
Yeah, we kept that secret pretty good. You know, he's speaking at the VFW hall tonight. You should come.
WOMAN
I'm not very political.
TOBY
There'll be free chicken.
WOMAN
You've been a... um, uh, what did you call it?
TOBY
Professional political operative.
WOMAN
You've been one your whole life.
TOBY
Well, there was a while back there when I was in elementary school.
The woman laughs.
WOMAN
You any good?
TOBY
 Yes, I'm very good.
WOMAN
What's your record?
TOBY
My record?
WOMAN
How many elections have you won?
TOBY
Altogether?
The woman nods.
TOBY
Including city council, two Congressional elections, a senate race, a Gubernatorial campaign, and a national campaign?
There's a long pause.
TOBY
...None.
WOMAN
None of them?
TOBY
You gotta be impressed with my consistency.
WOMAN
So, let me ask you something.
TOBY
Sure.
WOMAN
How come you're drinking so much so early in the day?
TOBY
Cause I'm about to get fired.
Toby finishes his drink, puts some money on the counter, and picks up his
coat.
TOBY
It was nice meeting you. 
FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *
ACT FOUR
FADE IN: INT. VFW HALL - NIGHT
	VFW HALL
	NASHUA, NH
	THREE YEARS EARLIER
Bartlet is speaking. Several people are seated and eating.
BARTLET
...Consumer price index, we tend to be late in responding to these trends, and we get what doctors call a "false positive". The science of economics is a lot less an exact science that we pretend. We build complex models with thousands of
interdependent and independent variables.
Toby is seated near a corner. Another member of Bartlet's staff, CAL MATHIS, approaches.
CAL MATHIS
What's he gonna say?
TOBY
About what?
CAL
If he's asked the question.
TOBY
What question?
CAL
New England D.F.C.
TOBY
I don't know.
CAL
You talked to him, didn't you?
TOBY
Yeah.
CAL
What's he gonna say?
TOBY
I don't know.
CAL
You talked to him about the New England D.F.C. if he's asked?
TOBY
Yes.
CAL
You wrote him a memo.
TOBY
Yes.
CAL
So what's he gonna say?
TOBY
I have no new information since the last time you asked me that question.
Bartlet is now speaking to a woman, who is standing.
BARTLET
Let me put it another way: you and your husband pay $600 more every year than you would if you were unmarried, living together, and filing individually. Couples living outside the covenant of marriage do so.
Josh is in the back of the room, reading a newspaper. Cal and Toby are still talking.
CAL
You told him to go ahead and piss off the dairy farmers, didn't you?
Toby just looks at him.
CAL
If he's asked about the New England D.F.C, you told him to piss off the dairy farmers.
TOBY
I asked him about his vote, he told me, I said then if he's asked about it tonight he should and only because it's the easiest thing to remember, tell the truth.
CAL
Do you enjoy losing?
TOBY
Not that much, but then I haven't had much to compare it to so...
Cal walks off. Bartlet continues talking to the woman.
BARTLET
...which then again is a much larger tax on overstated real profits.
WOMAN
Yes.
BARTLET
You really didn't understand any of that, right?
WOMAN
A little.
BARTLET
Me too. Yeah?
The man who raised his hand stands up.
MAN
Governor Bartlet, when you were a member of Congress, you voted against the New England Dairy Farming Compact. That vote hurt me sir.
Cal looks over at Toby.
MAN
I'm a businessman. That vote hurt me to the tune of maybe, 10 cents a gallon. I voted for you three times for Congress. I voted for you twice for Governor.
We see Josh again, still reading the newspaper.
MAN
And I'm here sir, and I'd like to ask you for an explanation.
BARTLET
 Yeah, I screwed you on that one.
Josh looks up, surprised.
MAN
I'm sorry?
BARTLET
I screwed you. You got hosed.
MAN
Sir, I...
BARTLET
And not just you. A lot of my constituents. I put the hammer to farms in Concord, Salem,
Laconia, and Elem.
Josh looks really shocked and is now watching Bartlet.
BARTLET
You guys got rogered but good.
The man sits down.
BARTLET
Today, for the first time in history, one in five Americans living in poverty are children.
We see a still surprised Josh.
BARTLET
One in five children live in the most abject, dangerous, hopeless, backbreaking, gut wrenching, poverty, one in five, and they're children. If fidelity to freedom and democracy is the code of our civic religion then surely, the code of our humanity is faithful service to that unwritten commandment that says "We shall give our children better than we ourselves had." I voted against the bill 'cause I didn't want it to be
hard for people to buy milk. I stopped some money from flowing into your pocket. If that angers you, if you resent me, I completely respect that, but if you expect anything different from the President of the United States, I suggest you vote for
somebody else. Thanks very much. Hope you enjoyed the chicken.
The audience applauds. Josh claps too.

Ron opens the door for Leo.
ABBEY
Jed, please. I want you to lie still for a few hours.
LEO
Mr. President?
BARTLET
I wanna see him.
LEO
 Is he okay?
ABBEY
I told him about Josh.
BARTLET
Please. Help me to the door.
LEO
You should stay in bed.
BARTLET
Charlie brought me some clothes. Please let me see him.
Abbey looks at Dr. Keller. He nods.
ABBEY
Okay. Just for a minute.
BARTLET
Great.
He starts to get up.
CUT TO: INT. VFW HALL, NASHUA, N.H. - NIGHT, THREE YEARS EARLIER
After the speech, Leo, Cal, Toby, Bartlet, and the rest of his staff are having a meeting.
BARTLET
What's next?
CAL
The thing about saying the name.
BARTLET
I understand.
JERRY
If I could just reframe the point that Cal was making.
BARTLET
I understand the point that Cal was making. I was sitting next to him when he made it, my ears are connected to my brain just like every body else. And I'm saying what's next?
CAL
Sir, not to put my head in the lion's mouth but by saying the name of your opponent in public you're essentially giving him free advertising.
JERRY
Cal thinks you should start referring to him as "my opponent" or "the other guy"?
CAL
Sir.
BARTLET
You're not afraid he's gonna make me look like I can't remember his name?
JERRY
No.
BARTLET
I am. I think it's going to make me look like I can't remember his name. I think it's going to make me look addled. I think it's going to make me look dotty. And even if it didn't make me look like those things it would remain a stupid idea. What's
next? Nothing? Excellent. 
LEO
Okay, what's next?
CAL
Leo, we have to talk about what happened tonight.
LEO
I think he did well. I would of liked to have seen more of those seats filled.
CAL
That's not what I'm talking about.
LEO
What're you talking about?
TOBY
He's talking about the Governor's answer tonight.
Everybody looks at Toby.
TOBY
I'm just guessing. I'm pretty drunk.
CAL
I am talking about the Governor's answer tonight. But I'm also talking about. Every day there's some. Look, Toby, we can talk about this in the room or if you're more comfortable we can--
LEO
Listen, I don't have time to make people comfortable. If a change has to be made, it has to be made. Jerry, Cal, Mack, Steve -- you're fired.
CAL
What?
TOBY
What?
LEO
No kidding. It's moving day. I want Toby. The rest of you-- thanks very much.
They all stare at Leo.
LEO
Fellas. Look at my face. You're done.
Everyone except Leo and Toby leaves.
LEO
 Don't screw up.
Leo exits. Toby is sitting alone under the light.
CUT TO: EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE THE VFW HALL - NIGHT
Leo joins Bartlet outside.
LEO
Its freezing cold in October! I don't know how you people live here.
BARTLET
Did you just fire Cal Mathis?
LEO
Yeah.
BARTLET
You fired him.
LEO
Yeah, and Jerry, and Mack, and Steve and the other guy.
BARTLET
Is there anyone you kept?
LEO
I kept Toby Ziegler.
BARTLET
Oh, you kept Toby Ziegler, and you fired everyone else.
LEO
Yeah.
BARTLET
Toby Ziegler is the only person working for us I don't know, and he's the one you kept!
LEO
Take him home, would you?
BARTLET
Those were the only people I know.
LEO
Those people were worthless. It's time we bring in what we need.
BARTLET
So you made that decision on your own.
LEO
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you're a crappy politician. I think you'll find I'll be making a lot of decisions on my own so get used to it.
BARTLET
You know I got elected to Congress by this state. This state sent me to Congress three times and elected me Governor all without your help.
LEO starts grinning.
BARTLET
Don't start!
LEO
No, seriously, that's a real political accomplishment, considering that your family founded this state.
BARTLET
Hey.
LEO
Were you even opposed in any of those elections?
BARTLET
You got rid of all the people I know!
LEO
Yeah. Have a good night.
Leo walks off. Bartlet follows.
BARTLET
Why are you doing this? You're a player. You're bigger in the party than I am. Hoynes would make you national chairman. Leo! Tell me this isn't one of the twelve steps.
Leo turns around to face his friend.
LEO
Yeah, that's what it is. Right after admitting we're powerless over alcohol and that a higher power can restore us to sanity, that's where you come in.
BARTLET
Leo.
LEO
Because I'm tired of it year after year after year after year having to chose between the lesser of who cares? Of trying to get myself excited about a candidate who can speak in
complete sentences. Of setting the bar so low, I can hardly look at it. They say a good man can't get elected President. I don't believe that, do you?
BARTLET
And you think I'm that man.
LEO
Yes.
BARTLET
Does it matter that I'm not as sure?
LEO
Nah. Act as if ye have faith and faith shall be given to you. Put it another way, fake it till you make it. You did good tonight.
BARTLET
Yeah.
They start walking again.
LEO
This is the time of Jed Bartlet, old friend. You're gonna open your mouth and lift houses off the ground. Whole houses, clear off the ground...
They continue to walk down the street as we --
FADE TO: INT. G.W. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - PRESENT
Bartlet and Leo are slowly walking down the hospital hall. Music has started, and we hear several news reports.
REPORTER 1 
And it's unknown at this time whether the President before going under anesthesia signed a letter that would give temporary custody.
REPORTER 2
...between George Washington Hospital and the White House where several thousand people have...
A big number of people are gathered in the streets.
REPORTER 3 
...begun to gather behind police barricades. An impromptu TV vigil with prayers being made...
We see Sam in his office, staring at his desk.
REPORTER 3 
...and collective breath being held.
We fade to Toby, in his office, as he puts his hands on his face.
REPORTER 2 
Clearly, I think, and understandably rocked on their heels at this hour, to put it mildly.
We see C.J. in her office, staring into space, her hand scratching her neck.
REPORTER 2 
Press Secretary C.J. Cregg appeared at her briefings to be shaken and withdrawn.
REPORTER 1 
...officials at George Washington Hospital. And in the third hour of a massive manhunt for a third suspect, airports up and down the Atlantic Coast are closed.
