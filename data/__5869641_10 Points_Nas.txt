53 Contributors10 Points Lyrics
America the beautiful, gangsta's paradise
For a black man to be rich, you say we sacrifice our own family members
Like we're not savvy enough to make outstanding figures
And ain't nobody in no cult
I give so much, financially give away
But there's an aspect of that that's crippling to us today
Still coping and dealing with my environment as a kid
I trust no one today because what someone in my past did

King, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldom they show it
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started sayin' "Peace King" on my song "The Flyest"
And after that, it took off like fire, peace, King

Take it from a street dude, you don't need to be a street dude
Get a lawyer, read your contract, and eat food
Become Roberta Flack or Lionel
When you catch flack, that mean they got they eye on you
Produce great results, they start to lie on you
Is it love for a Queens dude in Supreme shoes
Or did the street code expire with these dudes?
Especially now, I don't expect you to bow, but stand
Creating jobs, named my venture from after the land
I came from, that's unheard of
A hood that's known for murder now doing mergers
The streets is a lie, don't believe these dudes, jail or death is all you get
They tell you never move, but when they get money, they split
You might also like
King, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldom they show it
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started saying "Peace King" on my song "The Flyest" (Peace King)
And after that, it took off like fire

They hardly happy for you, keep doing what you do
You can't please everybody, and not everybody is you
Don't try to force a square peg in a round circle, that shit'll hurt you
Don't try to fit in either, you're better off with neither
Few veteran speakers get medicine when you need it
Especially when we all need knowledge instead of sneakers
Stop hangin' on to childhood trauma, it defeats us
Our challenge is holding ourselves back, I hope you felt that

Queen, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldom they show it
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started saying "Peace King" on my song "The Flyest"
And after that, it took off like fire, peace, King5Embed
