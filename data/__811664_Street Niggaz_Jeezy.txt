8 ContributorsStreet Niggaz Lyrics
As you can hear, we make quality street music
Every street nigga ain't a rapper
Every rapper ain't a street nigga
We always get it right,  music
CTE, we affiliates nigga, DJ (The fuck drama?)

I relate to niggas and they relate to me
Real niggas do real things that's how it supposed to be
Cut from the same clothes, and maybe the same shirt
Probably had the same plug and got the same work
I'll whack your ass and skip to the N.O
And lay low in the projects with my kinfolk
AK-47 with the shoulder strap (Yeah)
Set it off, had it sounded like the Nolia clap
Got two strikes, nigga, dodgin' one time
This real life, you got the nerve to call it punchlines
Well I got a punchline for you, you ain't talkin' 'bout shit I wanna see my lawyer

G-g-gangsters
Street niggas, real niggas
Street niggas
G-g-gangsters
Real niggas, street niggas-
You might also like
Fuck the style, they jockin' my slang
I'm a real street nigga, we are not the same
I'm grown nigga, so play with your own kids (Yeah)
I'm on nigga, so get your own ass 
One white girl left, save the last dance
My partner say he want it, so this your last chance (Yeah)
Funny how a next tell can get you 50 years (Nah)
Codefendant makin' deals like he work at Sears (Damn)
Still posted at the Amoco
Judge giving cash, three numbers like an 
Play the game how it go, fuck what a nigga think (Yeah)
'Cause under pressure, niggas change like chameleon paint (Yeah)

G-g-gangsters
Street niggas, real gangsters
Street niggas, g-g-gangsters
Street niggas, real gangsters
Street niggas

Ayy, ayy
White shit in my attic (What), and I ain't talkin' sheep rock (Let's get it)
They kill them nigga round the corner, now the blocks hot
Blockbuster, night Glocks poppin' like popcorn
Folks comin' through, shakin' niggas like popcorn (Yeah)
Niggas soft like hot butter, and they mics hot
'Cause section stayin' ass niggas love to drop salt
I'ma street poet, let me paint a picture (Yeah)
First of the month, time to get the  on
O's over here, couple O's over there
Gotta whole one stash to my living room chair
Dude never smile, ain't shit funny
Geesy, Maguire, now show me the money
G-g-gangsters
Street niggas, real gangsters
Street niggas, g-g-gangsters
Street niggas, real gangsters
Street niggasEmbed
