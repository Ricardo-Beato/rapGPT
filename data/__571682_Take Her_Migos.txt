23 ContributorsTake Her Lyrics
Pull up and I got the juice (I got the juice)
She looking at me and she choose (know she gon' choose)
Wanna take her to the room
Wanna take her, oh, I'm finna take her to the room
Wanna take her, man, I wanna take her, wanna take her
Wanna take her
Wanna take her, man, I wanna take her, wanna take her
Take her to the room, oh, I wanna take her to the room
I wanna take her, come on, wanna take her to the room

Wanna take her to my room, take her
Can I take you to my room?
I got a big house, I live in a mansion
I got a lake you can canoe
Every time she see the jewels
She say that it scaring her like peek-a-boo
I take her, go dab in the mall
She walking out, Christian Louboutin shoes
Came from 100 bands in the trap house
To making millions on the mic now
Remember the days in the bando
Used to pull up, it look like the white house
She act just like me and she humble
She look like her mama
She can get anything from me, keep the hunnas
But a nigga gotta get the commas
Remember the days, surprise on your birthday
Got you the H3 Hummer
Now we on the phone and she on the road
She gonna go get the blue bundle
I know that she loyal, know that she loyal
Know I gotta go spoil her, gotta go spoil her
Man, she look like Kimora, look like Kimora
Wanna ride like Sequoia
You might also like
Pull up and I got the juice (I got the juice)
She looking at me and she choose (know she gon' choose)
Wanna take her to the room
Wanna take her, oh, I'm finna take her to the room
Wanna take her, man, I wanna take her, wanna take her
Wanna take her
Wanna take her, man, I wanna take her, wanna take her
Take her to the room, oh, I wanna take her to the room
I wanna take her, come on, wanna take her to the room

Wanna take her to the room
Let that bitch blow me up like a balloon
Suckin' me up
Kissin' in Maison Margiela underwear costume
Hey girl, look at you
Make a nigga wanna give you the blue
I'm likin' the way you move
Austin Powers, baby groove
Take you to Montreal, Canada
Let you dive off in my 50 feet pool
All y'all vehicles old
Baby girl want some new
She say she want the 2014 Bentley
Baby girl, what you gon' do?
Is it me, is it me? No I think it's you
No offense to you, but I ain't spendin' my money on you
She said "no, baby don't go"
But I ain't spent my money on a bitch since 1994
Pull up and I got the juice (I got the juice)
She looking at me and she choose (know she gon' choose)
Wanna take her to the room
Wanna take her, oh, I'm finna take her to the room
Wanna take her, man, I wanna take her, wanna take her
Wanna take her
Wanna take her, man, I wanna take her, wanna take her
Take her to the room, oh, I wanna take her to the room
I wanna take her, come on, wanna take her to the room

Feelin' like T.I., I take her
Take her to the Himalayas
I am a player, I've never been saver
Pull up Audi like the raider
Your bitch wanna fuck with my pimpin'
Cause I be drippin', dabbin' all on your bitches
My pockets is fat, but my pants leg is skinny
Louboutin pennies cost a pretty penny
My bitch is so bad like I Dream of Jeannie
Phantom pulling up, after that Lamborghinis
Magically takin' your bitch, Houdini
I call her my chef, order linguini
I take her, debate her, I trade her, I might hit her later
My niggas bust her open like a baker
I fucked her, I skeeted all over her naval
I call my partner, pass her to my neighbor
I do not trust her, she suckin' the plastic
I beat it, I killed it, put it in a casket
She the talk of the trenchez, they know that she nasty
Know that she ratchet and she is not classy
I'm cool on her
I'll send her right back, give me this girl
You can have your ho
Pull up and I got the juice (I got the juice)
She looking at me and she choose (know she gon' choose)
Wanna take her to the room
Wanna take her, oh, I'm finna take her to the room
Wanna take her, man, I wanna take her, wanna take her
Wanna take her
Wanna take her, man, I wanna take her, wanna take her
Take her to the room, oh, I wanna take her to the room
I wanna take her, come on, wanna take her to the room13Embed
