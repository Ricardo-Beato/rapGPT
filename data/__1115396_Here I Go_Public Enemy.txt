5 ContributorsHere I Go Lyrics
Here I go, I don't give a damn if you with me
Stupidity, shit I'm the reverse of jiggy
All that prettiness running on empty
Only wusses need pity, no I ain't from the city
Five minutes of fame if you don't know my name
Oh yeah, I'm that field nigga they all fear
Here's a mad salute to all my troops
Fuck a lawyer and the law and all them suits
I spits and I vomit cause I come like a comet
Better quit it if y'all don't know what yall gettin' from it
Just forget it if you with it, that racket runnin' it
Come on come with it, I think I'll fit it
Go to war but what the hell i'm fightin for
As I soar yeah baby I like it raw
No cigar, I ran over the pop star with my car
Again and may the best jam win

Bingo, it don't matter if this platter's a single
Needin needles like The Beatles needin' Ringo
From the beginning, I told you how to see thru the linen
All that talk but that's the way the side walks in New York
I simplify cause you might be high
Rip shit in the pit so what you don't like it
This is man shit a hip-hop trip
On that aggressive tip but rap got pussy whipped
Got out psyched down on that turnpike
I knew this Philly who just wouldn't get right
Cause I was aware as a square in Delaware
Exec's writing checks for sex in spandex
Radio's gettin' sucked by labels under the table
Mix DJ's gettin' overpaid for airplay
Try to shut me down like ray, what I say?
Fuck your friends and may the best jam win
You might also like
Mirror mirror, I'm finger pointin' at the man
It is I, I interrupt the program
Chuck D rubberneckin' with the fans
P.E. don't give a damn about Uncle Sam
And on and on, like I said before
Some the 100 meter dash, I'm the marathon
Against the grain comin' like a train
As you listen to the sounds that remains insane
One on one, and it's just begun
To get out the ghetto and get something done
To be the man you gotta beat the man
Don't confuse me with being dumb or bubble gum
And I'll be here as you disappear
And I'll be around amongst the crowd
Cause anything I wear is a step on down
That's how I've always been
And may the best jam winEmbed
