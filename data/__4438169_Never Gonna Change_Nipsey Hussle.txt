3 ContributorsNever Gonna Change Lyrics
Yeah, look
I call it how I see it, I'm never gon' change
I love spending money and I love to gangbang
I like nice things, diamonds on my neck
Fuck bad bitches, show these hoes no respect
I call it how I see it, I'm never gon' change
I love spending money and I love to gangbang
I like nice things, diamonds on my neck
Fuck bad bitches, show these hoes no respect

Khakis, Chucks, beanie, white tees
You can tell where I'm from by the strings in my Nikes
Hatin' niggas is mad, lookin' mean, they don't like me
A certified chipper in these streets, I'm likely
To shut down the block with hours of powder
Have burners in his spot, boilin' grease in the pot
Fiends leanin' like kickstands, they say he was a preacher man
The lady with that bag down there pregnant, pushin' bastards
Yeah, it ruined lives but they gon' die anyway
If they don't get it from me, they gon' buy it anyway
And enemies could take your life any day
Let's do it for Baby Bo and ride on these fuck faces
Foldin' the sides of my Chuck Taylors
Black, with the matching knob on my trunk bangin'
Black on black for the murder weapon
I'm from where they five years old and see a murder happen
You might also like
I call it how I see it, I'm never gon' change
I love spending money and I love to gangbang
I like nice things, diamonds on my neck
Fuck bad bitches, show these hoes no respect
I call it how I see it, I'm never gon' change
I love spending money and I love to gangbang
I like nice things, diamonds on my neck
Fuck bad bitches, show these hoes no respect

Yeah yeah, what's happenin' wit' it, y'all
This your boy, Neighborhood Nip Hussle
The West Coast's finest
Giving a big shout out to all my bro bros that's locked up right now
Free Infant J. Stone, free my nigga Blacc Sam
Tiny Crusty, Tiny Bodie, all you niggas, hustleEmbed
