Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, uh
What the fuck? Uh, Perc'
CB on the beat, ho
Perc', mmm, mmm
Bitch, huh, huh

Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted, wasted

She do cocaine in my basement
I'm a doctor, but I'm runnin' out of patience
She told me that she tryna get closer to Satan
She be talkin' to him when she in the matrix

Damn, why is she so demonic?
She Medusa with a little Pocahontas
She been lacin' all my drugs or somethin'
'Cause every time that we're together, I'm unconscious
Hold up, uh, let me be honest
I know I saw her put the Percs in my chronic
Smoke until my eyes roll back like The Omen
Just another funeral for her, goddamn (Huh)

Rockstar, that's our style, these boys can't take it (Yeah)
Hatin', but they're still tryna take our cadence (Woah)
No basic, brand new 'Rari when I'm racin' (Yeah)
Take it, let you roll my weed, please don't lace it, yeah (Yeah)
That's a bum bitch that you chasin', ayy (Yeah)
Foreign with me, she a dominatrix (Woah)
I love that girl and I do like her body
"I don't want the money, I just want the molly"
That's what she say when she lived in the Valley
Lil' boy, I'm your father, hakuna matata
I made that girl give all of that top up
Got drugs in my hair, used the Perc' for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka
I'm takin' blue caps that keep tweakin' my chakra
Rose on my chain, there's no hint like no copper
Tats in the middle my head like I'm Avatar
That's the reason that I ride on my Appas
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted (Yeah)

My eyes closed, hopin' this ain't make-believe (Woah)
And she don't know that all her demons live in me, yeah (Woah)
I don't know, I don't know
Don't know what she been on (Don't know), I don't know
All that lean I sip on (Oh), now watch me pour it
One cup on me, don't got no friends (No friends)
I'm an open door, I ain't have to let her in (Let her in)
She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine (My heart), uh
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it (Huh)
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
