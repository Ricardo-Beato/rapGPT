9 ContributorsClose to Me Lyrics
I know some killas that'll kill you, to kill ya if ya close to me
I did some thangs, that I gotta keep it close to me

I know some niggas that'll kill ya if ya close to me
I know some killas, and I gotta keep em close to me
If you a snitch, then I dont need you standing close to me
I'm my own shooter, so I keep my pistol close to me

Don`t approach me  nigga like you`re so ho while I be smoking weed
I dont know you nigga, you dont know me nigga so dont come close to me
I had a girl one time, we broke up, I told that bitch to leave
I dont need no nigga, I dont need no bitch try to come close to me
Get away from me nigga, you standing too close, back up a couple feet
I dont know you nigga, you dont know me nigga, but your standing too close to me
These niggas be hoes, your my friend and my foe cause you ain't 
I love my friends but I gotta keep my enemies close to me
Close call, man I swear it was a close race
Close casket, but I'ma shoot ya in yo damn face
I got so much money, that they closed the damn case
A nigga try me, cold day in hell he get away
I drop a cool code 20, make ya neck break
They say that Gucci high hid it, thats what the vet say
Bullets rain, 
And all legit, but still 
She say I'm close to crazy, that's what that bitch say
I say I'm close to wealthy, that's what my wrist say
And I'm a multi-millionaire that's what my dick say
She tryna get close to me, but I don't want no girlfriend
She ask when am I gonna stop, I say til the world end
Pearl-face rolling, roll up with the pearl Benz

I know some killas, and I gotta keep em close to me
If you a snitch, then I dont need you standing close to me
I'm my own shooter, so I keep my pistol close to me
I know some niggas that'll kill ya if ya close to me
I know some killas, and I gotta keep em close to me
If you a snitch, then I dont need you standing close to me
I'm my own shooter, so I keep my pistol close to me

See I keep a scrap, I don't play with these niggas
Rock a by baby, move jack a nigga
458 my caterpillar
One time for the real niggas
All I hang around is the real niggas
Cut throat, selling pure coke
Nigga fuck with me, murder she wrote
In a club, Frank Lucas with a minkcoat
All I need is work in a speedboat
Truck full from my amigo
Free my dogs, fuck Rico
Bitch I'm off the molly, my eyes low
Wet crew, at one time
2 times for the don game
Bricksquad, new Wu Tang
My flag red, suwoo bang

I know some niggas that'll kill ya if ya close to me
I know some killas, and I gotta keep em close to me
If you a snitch, then I dont need you standing close to me
I'm my own shooter, so I keep my pistol close to me
I know some niggas that'll kill ya if ya close to me
I know some killas, and I gotta keep em close to me
If you a snitch, then I dont need you standing close to me
I'm my own shooter, so I keep my pistol close to me1Embed
