What up, Tyler?
(Got damn)What's up, nigga
What you doing
Shit, fuckin', shit, haha
Who the fuck is this?
Oh, this nigga? (Got damn)
Look at his forehead

This my little brother on my mother's side, our father died
He was living with my grandmother on the North side
Of Sacramento, but this fag ain't just visiting
He's settling in, he can't wait to start meddling
And doing the evil shit we do  (Does he skate?)
Yeah he skate too (Man, this nigga ugly) and he raps, ooh (Got damn)
This the newest Wolf Gang member and heâ€”
(What's his name?) Earl (Got damn)

Nigga, this nigga's forehead is so fuckin' big
This nigga, look at this fuckin' nigga lips, dog
This nigga's lips look like a split sundae (Got damn)
Yo this nigga's line is bended, (That's fucked up)
Yo, this nigga, this nigga look like a African poet (Got damn)
(Earl, say somethin')
Yo, this nigga's forehead looks like a fuckin' big-ass moose
(Nigga, don't be nervous nigga, say somethin'; trust me guys, he can rap)
He a bitch, (Just say somethin')
Nigga, don't be a bitch nigga, say somethin'
Nigga, rap, you fuckin' suck probably
Trust me guys, he can rap, just say somethin'You might also like12Embed
