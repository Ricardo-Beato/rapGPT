4 ContributorsOnetake Freestyle Pt. 2 Lyrics
Ay, my nigga
I came too far, I can't let my plans change
I’m going broke on dope to get my flip my last chain
To pop the tops off the bubbly on the yacht
Sippin' Rose and Cliquot, I do it with my people
Them same niggas guaped out count cash with me
Plus them same niggas that hopped out quick to blast with me
And stood by my side when they tried to blast niggas
And never ran, never scared like a man shouldn't
Recollectin’ my reflection on a smoker bike
Late night, nigga dropped death in a smoker pipe
He disappeared like thick fog into the open night
And doubled back with more crack and got some smoker's light
Now double that, that's more black with no hope in life
Can't run from that 'cause that's a fact and you know it's right
I wish my niggas could wake up and focus right
And I don't give a fuck about the type of music Oprah like
I ain’t no street nigga, I’m the street, nigga
Slauson muthafuckin' Ave, every word I speak, nigga
And if I’m lying, God strike me in the booth
Got my record label logo on the side of my shoe
Slauson Boy beaters, nigga, and they Crippin' blue
And your bitch on my dick, so make sure you buy two
Try who? Not Hussle, don't fuck with him
Skinny nigga, no muscle, so I buck niggas
Silly nigga, no hustle, no bucks
While my 'Lac be the bank like a fuckin’ Brinks truck, nigga
And it ain't nothin' that you haters never seen
Picture everything that you haters wanna be
I'm young, I'm fresh, and feelin' myself
I'm gettin' money on the books, no more concealing my wealth, man
I sleep at night, there's no feeling like it
Cop the iPhone, man, I'm shittin' on your Sidekick
745 floatin' with a fly bitch
La Costra Nostra, nigga, this is my shit
A Slauson baby, 1-9-85 shit
Fourteen-five a bird on some pie shit
Walkin' out the Fox Hills on some fly shit
I'm just living life on some "limit is the sky" shit
I'm on some "Ribbon in the Sky" shit
Classic music, you could view it
Few dispute it, 'cause these niggas know I really do it
I shoot up your spot, make you niggas move units
I grew up to Pac, who was bangin' in his music
People tryna blame that for the gang related shootings
But save that, this is everyday movement
Can't bring tool the school then the students stay truant
Yep, and them streets gotta school you
No curriculum, they teach a nigga, get your gun
You met your enemies but you ain't checked your biggest one
Look, with no curriculum, they teach a nigga, get your gun
You met your enemies but you ain't checked your biggest one, nigga

We've come too far
We can't be stopped, we're taking over
(We're taking over)
We've come too far to fall back now
We've come too far
We can't be stopped, we're taking over
(We're taking over)
We've come too far to fall back now

Come from the bottom, sometimes they gon' hate
Try to take your breath from the back, smile up in your face
Some of these bad as bottoms, just I'm pregnant by the game
These fake ass haters at my show screamin' my name
It's so lonely at the top, people don't understand
It's your time, so feel me, 'cause this is who I am
Oh, oh, oh...Embed
