2 ContributorsMe To We Lyrics
Get up! Get up and let ‘em know you still with ‘em no matter what happens!
Put your goddamn hands together for Public Enemy number one!

That’s the way we gonna do it
And that’s the way we gonna get through it

We the people, can we get together?
(Hell yeah!)
Can we get together, we the people?
(Oh yeah!)
See the people, are they free and equal?
(Hell no!)
Can we get from me to we, my people?
(We don’t know!)

Don’t you know

Here we come from another time
We be family type of rhyme
Public Enemy, might disagree
The deaf can’t hear it, the blind can’t see
Dumb is relative, blind can’t see
We all relatives, human family
No I in team, but who we be?
Thinking how we’d be from me to we
You might also like
We the people, can we get together?
(Hell yeah!)
Can we get together, we the people?
(Oh yeah!)
See the people, are they free and equal?
(Hell no!)
Can we get from me to we, my people?
(We don’t know!)

Don’t you know
Here we come, here we go
If you don’t know, I am the show
We get down for the crown
Step by step, we build this town
Overseas, on the road
Die hard fans at our show
How do we get from me to we?
Turn the M upside down on me and you will see

We the people, can we get together?
(Hell yeah!)
Can we get together, we the people?
(Oh yeah!)
See the people, are they free and equal?
(Hell no!)
Can we get from me to we, my people?
(We don’t know!)
It’s always for something
And something is nuttin’Embed
