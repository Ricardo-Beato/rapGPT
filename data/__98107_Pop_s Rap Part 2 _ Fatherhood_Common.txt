5 ContributorsPopâ€™s Rap Part 2 / Fatherhood LyricsHey, Hey old been, and you too baby sweets
I'm back in the studio, you know, I drove up
In the parking lot, and the parking lot was empty
Wasn't no cars out there like nobody wasn't even in here
All the doors were locked from the inside
But, I found a window cracked on the first floor so now I'm in here
Let's rap
So, I come in here, talk to my son, you know?
But, but, his next album he got comin' out
You know it's been such a spiritual feelin'
I had to come back in the studio just to see what he was doing
Cause I was gettin' those vibes all in the rocky mountains say, "I got to go,"
You know? I understand I'm finna' be a grandfather
And I'm so proud
I can say that in many ways, I can say I'm so happy, I'm so proud
You know? Son I wanna give you, you know?
Any direction in parenting at this stage
Because I think it's gonna come to you, just like it came to me
See you came to me and your mom from the spiritual world
We're just the physical parents, you know?
God loaned you to us, as God's spirit
We're the physical parents, you know?
Like I say, I'm not gonna give you no directions, you know?
But, I know when you started teaching me
See we talk about the life and education of one Lonnie Lynn
I think I'm the one that got taught, I do believe that, son, you know?
And I know when you started teaching me too
You know, I was hanging out, mad at the world
My professional basketball career was over
And I didn't believe in the red, white and blue anymore
And I was dissipatin' heavily, I wasn't experimentin', you know?
And one morning you looked across the table at me, it was like "What? Whatchu' gon' be? Whatchu' gon' do?
You got the responsibility to teach me the right things
You got the responsibility to teach me truth and respect and love, and safety"
You know? And my knees started gettin' a little stronger, you know?
I said, cause I can't get past these eyes man, it's just the eyes of a babe looking at me
And I couldn't look it off, I couldn't even play it off, you know?
And immediately I started gettin' the road maps seein' like how am I gon' do this?
I had to thank The Almighty for the strength, that he sent to me through you
So, I'm here to say, you know, thank you son
I'm here to say I'm so proud and numerous other things
Cause you've been a teacher to me, just like, I have supposed to be a teacher to you
Cause a lot of people think that parenting and raising a child is a one way street
But, you taught me continuous numerous lessons
And I love you my sonYou might also like1Embed
