Smoke so many blunts, nigga, I quit
Drink so many cups of lean, that I quit
Fucked so many bitches, nigga, I quit
She sucked my dick so good, nigga, I quit
Stunt so hard, my nigga, that I quit
Ball so hard, that fuck it, my nigga, I quit
I spend mills quick, but fuck it, my nigga, I quit
It's Gucci Mane, and nigga, fuck it, I quit

I told her  just don't touch me cause they bummy
44 bulldog on the table and I know G-Money know something
That bitch like  she stutter man, she stutter on your dick
 get with Wop,  looking for no vest
 I'm big one 
200 p's, 800 a piece
8 choppers, 200 a piece
King of New York, let's  the street
Top shot man, 
Scarface nigga get cut in the face
Mob boss nigga, I cut off your dick
Tony Soprano can't play the piano
 snitch 
I gotta get  in the pen
God forgive me, I murdered a man
Jim Carey I'm wearing a mask
Freddy Krueger when I'm grabbing the stash
Wrapping a brick, and I'm wrapping that dope, and I'm wrapping the stash, and I'm quitting with the cash
Gucci

Drink so many cups of lean, that I quit
Fucked so many bitches, nigga, I quit

All these pussy ass niggas, man, they telling out
They ain't bailin out, I call my plug up, and told him I quit
5 minutes later, I call him back, and said sike
Nigga, you know I'm just playing
Come and get me from the airport, nigga you know I just land
Real street nigga, my mama my number one fan
My mama sold dope, and my daddy did too
My Uncle Vick, yeah, he had a plug in Cali too
I done drunk so much syrup, I said fuck it, I quit
Yeah that's your wife, but late night she my bitch
You payed that bitch rent, she payed a thousand for my kicks
Need to leave these niggas' hoes alone, fuck it, I quit

Smoke so many blunts, nigga, I quit
Drink so many cups of lean, that I quit
Fucked so many bitches, nigga, I quit
She sucked my dick so good, nigga, I quit
Stunt so hard, my nigga, that I quit
Ball so hard, that fuck it, my nigga, I quit
I spend mills quick, but fuck it, my nigga, I quit
It's Gucci Mane, and nigga, fuck it, I quit
Stuffed my swisher smokin' California, can't quit
Sippin' mud out the coffin mud promethazine
Codeine, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean
I'm a fiend, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Molly, molly, molly me
Bitches fuck me by the three, they can't quit jumping me
I pushed they wig back, the judge acquitted me I did that
So California, I smoke my weed in zig zag
Dat piff, yeah we smoking on earwax
My coupe squatting like a 
California Pizza where I make drug deals at
I can't quit grinding cause them Ben Frank bills, yeah
Longway!

Smoke so many blunts, nigga, I quit
Drink so many cups of lean, that I quit
Fucked so many bitches, nigga, I quit
She sucked my dick so good, nigga, I quit
Stunt so hard, my nigga, that I quit
Ball so hard, that fuck it, my nigga, I quit
I spend mills quick, but fuck it, my nigga, I quit
It's Gucci Mane, and nigga, fuck it, I quitEmbed
