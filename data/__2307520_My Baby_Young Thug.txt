Goose with another one

Okay, lil' mama sharp with a razor
Okay, lil' mama fresher than a blazer
No way, I cannot fuck it in the anus
Hey yeah, baby we get Kurt, no Angle
And I got stripes like a bengal
And I can send 'em from every angle
Holy ghost with an angel
Holy moly mang!
I'ma stand up right beside my baby
If a pussy nigga play he might just die by my baby
Shoulda never tried my baby
No we don't die, we multiply my baby
Hurry up and sign it my baby
It's simple, just sign the dotted line my baby
I pull up and ride with my baby
New Rollie for my child and my baby

Do it like you always wanted
Thugger baby, I want your top, head
My diamonds are goin' dumb, SPED
I'm inside your mouth like gum
Experiment, no wreck, I put dents on a bitch
I'll buy her mink, not trench, I'm a pimp
Big racks got me walkin' with a limp
Buyin' Rollies on Rollies like I'm Flavor Flavor's shrimp
Versace cover, roll that bitch up like some weed
She whip that ass like her name Neff B
I got more karats than a cavity
Baby don't pull it out of your teeth
We go shoppin' at Bal Harbour for the beach
Ain't talkin' car but I need her to spoil me
And I'ma beat that pussy, concrete
Like a mothafuckin' street
I'ma feed her my milk
Every time I feel tired, I need three hoes like a elf
You're a ho, ho, ho; don't care, I'ma keep it all to myself
Tie my ties on your belt
Wit' ya 'til ya dead and pale
I heard someone's there walked in and said
You might also like
Okay lil' mama sharp with a razor
Okay lil' mama fresher than a blazer
No way, I cannot fuck it in the anus
Hey yeah, baby we get kurt, no Angle
And I got stripes like a bengal
And I can send 'em from every angle
Holy ghost with an angel
Holy moly mang
I'ma stand up right beside my baby
If a pussy nigga play he might just die by my baby
Shoulda never tried my baby
No we don't die, we multiply my baby
Hurry up and sign it my baby
It's simple just sign the dotted line my baby
I pull up and ride with my baby
New Rollie for my child and my baby

Eli Manning, Peyton Manning throwin' dick in that hole
She told me that she love the way I dress, like a prince but I'm a boy
I made the chart
And like Wayne, baby it's all at the start
Girl I'm just startin' with that pussy
I eat ya hunny bun ya pussy
You have me smilin' when you're lookin'
Big ole' round booty soft as cushion
Stop talkin', pussy nigga, you a wussy
Tryna reach, nigga, he might be bookin'
Sprayin' my cologne now we smell just like some cookies
And if you suck that dick, don't kiss my jaw or else I'm mushin'
Daddy time, daddy time
Got a room full of big booty bitches, it's my prime
Filled with iron, filled with iron
I throw some ones, baby catch it like the swine
I fill my truck up with nothin' but that diesel
I let that MAK-90 vibrate just like a beeper
Y'all livin' cheaper, nigga this the sequel
I'm laughin' at these pussy niggas like a hyena
Okay lil' mama sharp with a razor
Okay lil' mama fresher than a blazer
No way, I cannot fuck it in the anus
Hey yeah, baby we get kurt, no Angle
And I got stripes like a bengal
And I can send 'em from every angle
Holy ghost with an angel
Holy moly mango
I'ma stand up right beside my baby
If a pussy nigga play he might just die by my baby
Shoulda never tried my baby
No we don't die, we multiply my baby
Hurry up and sign it my baby
It's simple just sign the dotted line my baby
I pull up and ride with my baby
New Rollie for my child and my baby3Embed
