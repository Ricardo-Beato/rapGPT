13 ContributorsTime I Give Lyrics
I know the time I give
It takes away from the time I live (Yeah)
I know the time I give
It takes away from the time I live (Yeah)

Uh, I got time, women, they on my mind
Call me Optimus Prime 'cause I'm optimistic
Kinda like Picasso, damn artistic
And when I'm in the zone, yes, I'm so artistic
Better listen up 'cause homie, you might miss it
Nah, let me slow it down one time
Decipher the code so you understand the rhyme like this
Uh, uh, yeah
Now you better remember
I'm in a dilemma, risin' from the underground
Kinda like a tremor, cold like December
This a record to remember 'cause I'ma give it my all
Head up, chin down, humble and ready to brawl
Never ready to fall, never ready to fall
Never ready to fall, never ready to fall
Never ready to fall, at all

You ever wonder what it's like
To be a hostage in the night?
You ever wonder what it's like
To be a hostage in the night?
You might also like
Uh, I can't sleep, contemplatin' defeat
Writin' divine rhymes for emcees, I eat
Said it's 'bout time, time that I shine
I'm comin' up from behind, never heard a style like mine
Sacrifice rest to write, day for night
Watch a young man get rich just for spite
'Cause they never thought I'd make it
Uh, let me get it, people, they rock wit' it
Got that Alien vs. Predator flow so I spit acidic
Yeah, and that's it for me
Like a book about the past, that's history
Peace

Your key to your success is gon' come from your pen

I know the time I give
It takes away from the time I live (Yeah)
I know the time I give
It takes away from the time I live (Yeah)Embed
