Boss up and shakedown
Gotta boss up and shakedown

You ain't fuckin' with these clowns like
How you like me now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
Get your head out the clouds
Gotta go and get it now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
Go and bet the whole thou'
For the taking right now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
Fuck all that talking loud
It's about right now
Gotta boss up and shakedown

Slow motion like an ocean front
So smooth, like "Where you get ya lotion from?"
It's the way you know me from
Ballin' like it's open run
If I hold no phone on myself and point a loaded gun
No flash, no stacks
Cool with that
Used to catch the bus to 12, ass crack with the pack
Had me sitting to the side, couldn't even lean back
Now the only track I know is gеtting done with the Mac
With thesе tools are pro, man, who sold you those?
Who let your ass record? Your engineer is a troll
I done rose out the hole under that light bulb
Now I pose wearing clothes, shit, you don't even know
Say she want me for my money, even that ain't enough
Say she done living lies, well, who can I trust?
Every morning, waking up like "This can't be"
Now I understand the best things in life are free
You might also like
You ain't fuckin' with these clowns like
How you like me now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
Get your head out the clouds
Gotta go and get it now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
Go and bet the whole thou'
For the taking right now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
Fuck all that talking loud
It's about right now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
You don't like me now
When I made a mess, always there to wipe me down
Now that you're not around, felt like Miles without Francis
Always question everything but you had all the answers
Everything my fault, thought that love could be bought
It was all sugar 'til it turned to salt
Felt like I was trapped until I got caught
Thought I had everything until I took that loss
But cheaters never win is what some might say
I threw the whole game, in the end, got paid
Had to cover the spread, cold side of the bed
Never miss nobody when you live in your head
Fed up with all the extra shit, I just shut down
By myself, looking stupid, what I'm 'posed to do now
Fed up with all the extra shit, I just shut down
Looking stupid, what I'm 'posed to do now
You ain't fuckin' with these clowns like
How you like me now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
Get your head out the clouds
Gotta go and get it now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
Go and bet the whole thou'
For the taking right now
Gotta boss up and shakedown
Fuck all that talking loud
It's about right now
Gotta boss up and shakedownEmbed
