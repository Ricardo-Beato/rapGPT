22 ContributorsDidn’t U Know Lyrics
Uh uh uh uh uh
Yeah
That’s what I’m talking about
Lemme clean my glasses
Lemme wipe off my sneakers
Lemme tilt my hat
You understand

Calm down, shorty, the alpha dude’s up
They don’t wanna touch ‘em they alpha dude touch
Just when they think they getting slick I lift
Switch my altitude up
Drop a little jewelry down
Pick my valuables up lay my tomfoolery down
They like the way I Converse
They alpha dude Chucks
But these Taylors here are tailor-made for me
The Geminis the Pros and the Sh-Shayla Gs
Yeah, a four-man squad that’ll play your league
Play you four-on-forty, give you a hundred-point lead
Then we still pimp the game like it’s Hunter’s point, please
Homie (Homie) Y-y-ya know me (ya know me)
You might see me down Stoney Island, Ridin’
Madison-Travelin’, Michigan-Visitin’
Roosevelt-Rollin’, Home and Roamin’
Halstead-Walkin’, Jeffrey’s-Joggin’
You might also like
Yes, he's problems, didn’t you know? (echo)
He’s here!

I’m right behind ya man
Who you think better than
I’m over ya heads like Excedrin
I keep telling them
I’m coming
Keep pumping me like a veteran
I do it
Part in confidence just that my jargon’s number one in my conference
I take state, raise stakes while joggin’
We take nationals no bargains
I’m barging through the door
I’m tired of knocking my knuckles are sore
It’s nothing no more
FNF hot like TNT pop D and D not
Disturbed revenge of the nerds
I told you vengeance is hers
Time to get my grown woman on like bees and the birds
Me and my squad like peas in a pod
Haven’t you heard (echo)
Homie (homie)
Y-y-ya know me (ya know me)
You might see me ‘bout Stoney Island
Ridin’
79th
Wildin’
While while hundred stallions
State Street grinding that’s who I am
Didn’t you know (echo)
He’s here!

Uh,You’re now Hip Hoppin’ with the better
FNF
I do it for the letters
Track tripping pimping
I do it for the cheddar
I chat different, listen
How I put it all together
Wonder how I remain cool
When I’m pedaling the fire
When niggas got littler than a sweater in the dryer
Homie, I was a pusher of medicines for hire
So I can walk through the cookers without sweating my attire
Get through the drought without sweating my supplier
Without giving out my connect to the buyers
I hope I get it correct
Before the sun rises in the west
And god sends his Messiah
And then he wakes up the tired and is done
Homie (Homie)
Y-y-ya know me (ya know me)
You might see me down Stoney Island-Ridin’
Madison-Travelin’
Lakeshore or State and
Lake Street pacin’
Harvey-Hoppin’
Alden-Poppin’
K-Town-Creepin’
South Shore-Shufflin’
While while wanderin’
Housin’
Hustlin’
Hometown hero
Chicago’s tomorrow
West side hanger
Yes, he’s danger
Didn’t you know? (echo)
He’s here!Embed
