30 ContributorsSuper Duper Fly Lyrics
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, turn me up
Yo, just leave this shit up to me, pal

They call me Hop, the king of this hip-hop
The moment that I hopped in the game it got hot (Okay)
Rappers thought that they would be ruinin' my plots
In this industry but homie I'm doing it voila
Soon as I step up the flow, niggas know I'm untouchable
With the mic I'ma cut ya throat, guess it's 'cause I'm so rugged, yo
I'm keepin' it real, fuck the dough
I'm lying, homie, I love it, yo
I'm a beast at this, I ain't really unleashed it yet
Obviously I have, I'm just bad at keepin' it secretive
If you do wanna piece of this, buddy you can receive it quick
Yeah, I know that you sayin' fuck Hopsin, he's a dick
I give the sheets a clip of how I metamorphed the game
I'ma wreck it off the chain, 'til my records often played
Spread a web across ya name, make sure you stuck in it
Grab ya belt and buckle it, time to end all this fuckin' shit

I got some flows and they super duper nice
Just gimme a dope beat and I'll be super duper tight
Lace it up, sell it for a super duper price
Why? Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly
Hey, I'm so fly (Fly)
Look at me flyin' away (Ooh)
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey (I can fly) Uh-huh
You might also like
Now the bomb is lit, flow is one word: astonishing
Becoming different, changin' it up is what I’m promising
Yeah you got potential and all a that but you not as sick
Someone tell these low, down, and dirty fuckers who Hopsin is
It's been awhile, feels like five hundred years
But the apocalypse is finally here, a lot of these queers
Just run around thinking that they hot but they cold as fuck
When I drop that shit gon' be over and y'all gon' know wassup
Niggas acting like that they hate to show love
'Til they find out what I'm capable of
I'm finna fizz up like baking soda, put so much pressure on you niggas you'll be forced to exit the game, 'cause my games is so tough
But you muthafuckas is probably gon' keep on coming back like roaches
But I have the potion, I'll eat you just like a pack of vultures
'Cause I rap ferocious, y'all lack emotion that's needed in this
I bees the business so what can I say, I just need to win it

I got some flows and they super duper nice
Just gimme a dope beat and I'll be super duper tight
Lace it up, sell it for a super duper price
Why? Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly
Hey, I'm so fly (Fly)
Look at me flyin' away (Ooh)
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey (I can fly) Uh-huh
My image doesn’t appear to be vicious
But just by hearin' me rip this
I'm sure that you could tell I'm lyrically gifted
It's a conspiracy, is it?
Definitely, if you step to diss me
I'll make sure you restin’ in peace, switch a mic, I wreck an emcee
Evidently I'm known to killers, the devil in me
You can tell it's in me, my flow has been mastered elegantly
If you fellas tip me it's 'cause you feelin' the jealous envy
Next I put more thought in it before you sell ya cd
I wouldn't say that I'm the father of rap, but raps father died so I just adopted his ass
Since none a y'all will take him in, watch what I'ma make of him
The nigga finna be the muthafuckin' hottest thing again
Y'all been treatin' the game wrong, man Hopsin ain't ya friend
I ain't taking back none of my words, fuck who they offend
Y'all claimin' that y'all niggas from the hood and the streets
Then why's the motherfuckin' game Hollywood as can be?

I got some flows and they super duper nice
Just gimme a dope beat and I'll be super duper tight
Lace it up, sell it for a super duper price
Why? Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly
Hey, I'm so fly (Fly)
Look at me flyin' away (Ooh)
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey (I can fly) Uh-huh6Embed
