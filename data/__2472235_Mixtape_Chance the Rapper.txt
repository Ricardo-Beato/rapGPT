Am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes? (Hell no!)
Am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes?
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch, wanna know how lips taste
(She curious, she curious)
I swear that I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch, wanna know how the lips taste
All I can hear is the third, ayy
All I can hear is the third, ayy
We don't know none of your words, ayy
We don't know none of your words, ayy
I like my women real tall, ayy
Type that can really play ball, ayy
You buy my hat at the park, ayy
Think I might really play ball, ayy
I got a link in my bio
My bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo
They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo
How can they call themselves bosses
When they got so many bosses?
You gotta see what your boss say
I get it straight out the faucet
I ain't felt like this since the third Drought, third Carter drop
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop
And yeah, my momma got real worried when she heard I college dropped
But now I call the shots
You might also like
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
(She curious, she curious)
I swear that I'm the only nigga still cares about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste

Bad little mama, she gettin' it Obama
She sting like a bumblebee, hot as the sauna
She shine like a Rollie, got that from her momma
Can't see me, can't be me, I'm ridin' like a panda
That booty gon' roll and it's outta control
And these bitches gon' fuck off respect and that loyalty
All my bitches lovin' me and they spoil me
Rub me down with that lotion, babe, oil me
Drinking Actavis, baby, I'm slowin' me
In that choppa I see your perimeter
Change the culture, 'cause my ring is a solar
Wait one minute, I told you
Yeah, I would like to know you
Yeah, you lucky like clovers
Yeah, the clothes no good
Mama I do it, the racks I pursue it
Just look at me baby, I came from the sewers
They love all the slime ball
Like they fuck all these cats on your slime dog
I got me some rings like I'm Bruce Bowen
I'm ballin' on you like I'm Chris Paul
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
(She curious, she curious)
I swear that I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
Am I the only one who really care about cover art?
Growing up I ain't have my brother 'cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again, they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After "1 Night," them folks thought I was finished
I pinned my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch, I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh, they fuck with me 'cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance
Bitch, it's Boat from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch
Walk with my hand on my dick, I'm the shit
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
(She curious, she curious)
I swear that I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste25Embed
