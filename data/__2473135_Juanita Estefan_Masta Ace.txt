Hey; meet Juanita Estefan
Of all the girls in the grade, she's the best of 'em
She's the captain in the cheerleading team
Got more hips and wave more ass than the rest of 'em
Damn! It's like she busting out of uniform
She got me walking 'round the school with the unicorn
In my corduroys, she be having all the boys
Running through the halls, making all the noise
She the one we be lusting on
Got me saying "woo-hah" like the Busta song
I walked behind her in the corridor
Saying "damn, damn, damn" like a Florida
On the couch in my crib, so for tactics
And if we need her, ma got crazy prophylactics
Yup; that's why I put you in my song
Juanita Estefan - you really turn me on
You might also like
Juanita Estefan - you really turn me on
Juanita Estefan - I said you really turn me on
Juanita Estefan - you really turn me on
Juanita Estefan - I said you really turn me on
Juanita Estefan - you really turn me on
Juanita Estefan - I said you really turn me on
Juanita, Juanita, Juanita

Chiquita Jefferson, she live in the P.Js
And got a thang for ball players and DJs
She kinda rough though, thangs some getting used to
On top of that she smoke more weed than Snoop do
And best believe, she know how to play the game
Mad credit, cell phone in her baby name (yup)
And barbecue on the front porch, she really hood
Credit cards scams and all that, she really good
And the local game is nigga like
Ronda Rousey, she fight like a nigga fight
And she been knocking out chicks since she was knocked up
She used to spar her baby daddy, but he locked up
And you can't tell me nothing, that's my boo thang
Listen to everything: 2 Chainz to Wu-Tang
You gotta see her in a thong (yup)
Chiquita Jefferson - you really turn me on
Chiquita Jefferson - you really turn me on
Chiquita Jefferson - I said you really turn me on
Chiquita Jefferson - you really turn me on
Chiquita Jefferson - I said you really turn me on
Chiquita Jefferson - you really turn me on
Chiquita Jefferson - I said you really turn me on
Chiquita, Chiquita, Chiquita2Embed
