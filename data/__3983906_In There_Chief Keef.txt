8 ContributorsIn There Lyrics
I was in the streets when momma found me
And she was mad I was in there
If I needed somewhere to hide
Would you let me in there?
Baby when you gon' stop playin' and let me in there?
You got up in your feelings, you ain't got no business in there

Fuck it
Aye, put two tears up in a fuckin' bucket
Throw at three at you some like I'm Jimmy Buckets
This loud is causing all the fuckin' ruckus
Aye, Gucci polo but I ain't playin' rugby
Bitches runnin' up to hug me
Aye, used to say that I was ugly
Now all these hoes see is money
Aye, now I don't even be hungry
'Member when I ain't eat nothin'
Aye, bitches said that I was nothin', 'till I became somethin'
Put the dope up in the blunt, put it in my lung
Got my swag from outer space, it ain't American
We got the juugs from I can't say, but they gon' get you done
I'll smoke this blunt to the face and I ain't gon' give you none

I was in the streets when momma found me
And she was mad I was in there
If I needed somewhere to hide
Would you let me in there?
Baby when you gon' stop playin' and let me in there?
You got up in your feelings, you ain't got no business in thereYou might also likeEmbed
