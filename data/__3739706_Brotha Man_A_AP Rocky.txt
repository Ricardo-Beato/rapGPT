1 ContributorMajor Barbara (Act 2) LyricsThe yard of the West Ham shelter of the Salvation Army is a cold place on a January morning. The building itself, an old warehouse, is newly whitewashed. Its gabled end projects into the yard in the middle, with a door on the ground floor, and another in the loft above it without any balcony or ladder, but with a pulley rigged over it for hoisting sacks. Those who come from this central gable end into the yard have the gateway leading to the street on their left, with a stone horse-trough just beyond it, and, on the right, a penthouse shielding a table from the weather. There are forms at the table; and on them are seated a man and a woman, both much down on their luck, finishing a meal of bread  and diluted milk.
The man, a workman out of employment, is young, agile, a talker, a poser, sharp enough to be capable of anything in reason except honesty or altruistic considerations of any kind. The woman is a commonplace old bundle of poverty and hard-worn humanity. She looks sixty and probably is forty-five. If they were rich people, gloved and muffed and well wrapped up in furs and overcoats, they would be numbed and miserable; for it is a grindingly cold, raw, January day; and a glance at the background of grimy warehouses and leaden sky visible over the whitewashed walls of the yard would drive any idle rich person straight to the Mediterranean. But these two, being no more troubled with visions of the Mediterranean than of the moon, and being compelled to keep more of their clothes in the pawnshop, and less on their persons, in winter than in summer, are not depressed by the cold: rather are they stung into vivacity, to which their meal has just now given an almost jolly turn. The man takes a pull at his mug, and then gets up and moves about the yard with his hands deep in his pockets, occasionally breaking into a stepdance.
THE WOMAN
Feel better otter your meal, sir?
THE MAN
No. Call that a meal! Good enough for you, props; but wot is it to me, an intelligent workin man.
THE WOMAN
Workin man! Wot are you?
THE MAN
Painter.
THE WOMAN
 Yus, I dessay.
THE MAN
Yus, you dessay! I know. Every loafer that can't do nothink calls isself a painter. Well, I'm a real painter: grainer, finisher, thirty-eight bob a week when I can get it.
THE WOMAN
Then why don't you go and get it?
THE MAN
I'll tell you why. Fust: I'm intelligent--fffff! it's rotten cold here --yes: intelligent beyond the station o life into which it has pleased the capitalists to call me; and they don't like a man that sees through em. Second, an intelligent bein needs a doo share of appiness; so I drink somethink cruel when I get the chawnce. Third, I stand by my class and do as little as I can so's to leave arf the job for me fellow workers. Fourth, I'm fly enough to know wots inside the law and wots outside it; and inside it I do as the capitalists do: pinch wot I can lay me ands on. In a proper state of society I am sober, industrious and honest: in Rome, so to speak, I do as the Romans do. Wots the consequence? When trade is bad--and it's rotten bad just now--and the employers az to sack arf their men, they generally start on me.
THE WOMAN
What's your name?
THE MAN
Price. Bronterre O'Brien Price. Usually called Snobby Price, for short.
THE WOMAN
Snobby's a carpenter, ain't it? You said you was a painter.
PRICE
Not that kind of snob, but the genteel sort. I'm too uppish, owing to my intelligence, and my father being a Chartist and a reading, thinking man: a stationer, too. I'm none of your common hewers of wood and drawers of water; and don't you forget it. . Wots YOUR name?
THE WOMAN
Rummy Mitchens, sir.
PRICE
 Your elth, Miss Mitchens.
RUMMY
 Missis Mitchens.
PRICE
Wot! Oh Rummy, Rummy! Respectable married woman, Rummy, gittin rescued by the Salvation Army by pretendin to be a bad un. Same old game!
RUMMY
What am I to do? I can't starve. Them Salvation lasses is dear good girls; but the better you are, the worse they likes to think you were before they rescued you. Why shouldn't they av a bit o credit, poor loves? They're worn to rags by their work. And where would they get the money to rescue us if we was to let on we're no worse than other people? You know what ladies and gentlemen are.
PRICE
Thievin swine! Wish I ad their job, Rummy, all the same. Wot does Rummy stand for? Pet name props?
RUMMY
Short for Romola.
PRICE
For wot!?
RUMMY
Romola. It was out of a new book. Somebody me mother wanted me to grow up like.
PRICE
We're companions in misfortune, Rummy. Both on us got names that nobody cawnt pronounce. Consequently I'm Snobby and you're Rummy because Bill and Sally wasn't good enough for our parents. Such is life!
RUMMY
Who saved you, Mr. Price? Was it Major Barbara?
PRICE
No: I come here on my own. I'm goin to be Bronterre O'Brien Price, the converted painter. I know wot they like. I'll tell em how I blasphemed and gambled and wopped my poor old mother--
RUMMY
 Used you to beat your mother?
PRICE
Not likely. She used to beat me. No matter: you come and listen to the converted painter, and you'll hear how she was a pious woman that taught me me prayers at er knee, an how I used to come home drunk and drag her out o bed be er snow white airs, an lam into er with the poker.
RUMMY
That's what's so unfair to us women. Your confessions is just as big lies as ours: you don't tell what you really done no more than us; but you men can tell your lies right out at the meetins and be made much of for it; while the sort o confessions we az to make az to be wispered to one lady at a time. It ain't right, spite of all their piety.
PRICE
Right! Do you spose the Army'd be allowed if it went and did right? Not much. It combs our air and makes us good little blokes to be robbed and put upon. But I'll play the game as good as any of em. I'll see somebody struck by lightnin, or hear a voice sayin "Snobby Price: where will you spend eternity?" I'll ave a time of it, I tell you.
RUMMY
You won't be let drink, though.
PRICE
I'll take it out in gorspellin, then. I don't want to drink if I can get fun enough any other way.
Jenny Hill, a pale, overwrought, pretty Salvation lass of 18, comes in through the yard gate, leading Peter Shirley, a half hardened, half worn-out elderly man, weak with hunger.
JENNY
 Come! pluck up. I'll get you something to eat. You'll be all right then.
PRICE
 Poor old man! Cheer up, brother: you'll find rest and peace and appiness ere. Hurry up with the food, miss: e's fair done. . Ere, buck up, daddy! She's fetchin y'a thick slice o breadn treacle, an a mug o skyblue. .
RUMMY
 Keep up your old art! Never say die!
SHIRLEY
I'm not an old man. I'm ony 46. I'm as good as ever I was. The grey patch come in my hair before I was thirty. All it wants is three pennorth o hair dye: am I to be turned on the streets to starve for it? Holy God! I've worked ten to twelve hours a day since I was thirteen, and paid my way all through; and now am I to be thrown into the gutter and my job given to a young man that can do it no better than me because I've black hair that goes white at the first change?
PRICE
 No good jawrin about it. You're ony a jumped-up, jerked-off, orspittle-turned-out incurable of an ole workin man: who cares about you? Eh? Make the thievin swine give you a meal: they've stole many a one from you. Get a bit o your own back. . There you are, brother. Awsk a blessin an tuck that into you.
SHIRLEY
 I never took anything before.
JENNY
 Come, come! the Lord sends it to you: he wasn't above taking bread from his friends; and why should you be? Besides, when we find you a job you can pay us for it if you like.
SHIRLEY
 Yes, yes: that's true. I can pay you back: it's only a loan.  Oh Lord! oh Lord! .
JENNY
Well, Rummy, are you more comfortable now?
RUMMY
God bless you, lovey! You've fed my body and saved my soul, haven't you?  Sit down and rest a bit: you must be ready to drop.
JENNY
I've been going hard since morning. But there's more work than we can do. I mustn't stop.
RUMMY
Try a prayer for just two minutes. You'll work all the better after.
JENNY
 Oh isn't it wonderful how a few minutes prayer revives you! I was quite lightheaded at twelve o'clock, I was so tired; but Major Barbara just sent me to pray for five minutes; and I was able to go on as if I had only just begun.  Did you have a piece of bread?
PAIGE
 Yes, miss; but I've got the piece that I value more; and that's the peace that passeth hall hannerstennin.
RUMMY  Glory Hallelujah!
Bill Walker, a rough customer of about 25, appears at the yard gate and looks malevolently at Jenny.
JENNY
That makes me so happy. When you say that, I feel wicked for loitering here. I must get to work again.
She is hurrying to the shelter, when the new-comer moves quickly up to the door and intercepts her. His manner is so threatening that she retreats as he comes at her truculently, driving her down the yard.
BILL
I know you. You're the one that took away my girl. You're the one that set er agen me. Well, I'm goin to av er out. Not that I care a curse for her or you: see? But I'll let er know; and I'll let you know. I'm goin to give er a doin that'll teach er to cut away from me. Now in with you and tell er to come out afore I come in and kick er out. Tell er Bill Walker wants er. She'll know what that means; and if she keeps me waitin it'll be worse. You stop to jaw back at me; and I'll start on you: d'ye hear? There's your way. In you go. .
PRICE
. Easy there, mate. She ain't doin you no arm.
BILL
Who are you callin mate? . You're goin to stand up for her, are you? Put up your ands.
RUMMY
. Oh, you great brute-- .
JENNY
. Oh God forgive you! How could you strike an old woman like that?
BILL
. You Gawd forgive me again and I'll Gawd forgive you one on the jaw that'll stop you prayin for a week. . Av you anything to say agen it? Eh?
PRICE
. No, matey: she ain't anything to do with me.
BILL
Good job for you! I'd put two meals into you and fight you with one finger after, you starved cur.  Now are you goin to fetch out Mog Habbijam; or am I to knock your face off you and fetch her myself?
JENNY
 Oh please someone go in and tell Major Barbara--.
BILL
You want to go in and tell your Major of me, do you?
JENNY
Oh please don't drag my hair. Let me go.
BILL
Do you or don't you? . Yes or no.
JENNY
God give me strength--
BILL
 Go and show her that, and tell her if she wants one like it to come and interfere with me. . Here: finish your mess; and get out o my way.
SHIRLEY
 You take a liberty with me, and I'll smash you over the face with the mug and cut your eye out. Ain't you satisfied--young whelps like you--with takin the bread out o the mouths of your elders that have brought you up and slaved for you, but you must come shovin and cheekin and bullyin in here, where the bread o charity is sickenin in our stummicks?
BILL
 Wot good are you, you old palsy mug? Wot good are you?
SHIRLEY
As good as you and better. I'll do a day's work agen you or any fat young soaker of your age. Go and take my job at Horrockses, where I worked for ten year. They want young men there: they can't afford to keep men over forty-five. They're very sorry--give you a character and happy to help you to get anything suited to your years--sure a steady man won't be long out of a job. Well, let em try you. They'll find the differ. What do you know? Not as much as how to beeyave yourself--layin your dirty fist across the mouth of a respectable woman!
BILL
Don't provoke me to lay it acrost yours: d'ye hear?
SHIRLEY
 Yes: you like an old man to hit, don't you, when you've finished with the women. I ain't seen you hit a young one yet.
BILL
 You lie, you old soupkitchener, you. There was a young man here. Did I offer to hit him or did I not?
SHIRLEY
Was he starvin or was he not? Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer? Would you hit my son-in-law's brother?
BILL
Who's he?
SHIRLEY
Todger Fairmile o Balls Pond. Him that won 20 pounds off the Japanese wrastler at the music hall by standin out 17 minutes 4 seconds agen him.
BILL
 I'm no music hall wrastler. Can he box?
SHIRLEY
Yes: an you can't.
BILL
Wot! I can't, can't I? Wot's that you say ?
SHIRLEY
 Will you box Todger Fairmile if I put him on to you? Say the word.
BILL
 I'll stand up to any man alive, if he was ten Todger Fairmiles. But I don't set up to be a perfessional.
SHIRLEY
 YOU box! Slap an old woman with the back o your hand! You hadn't even the sense to hit her where a magistrate couldn't see the mark of it, you silly young lump of conceit and ignorance. Hit a girl in the jaw and ony make her cry! If Todger Fairmile'd done it, she wouldn't a got up inside o ten minutes, no more than you would if he got on to you. Yah! I'd set about you myself if I had a week's feedin in me instead o two months starvation. .
BILL
 You lie! you have the bread and treacle in you that you come here to beg.
SHIRLEY
 Oh God! it's true: I'm only an old pauper on the scrap heap.  But you'll come to it yourself; and then you'll know. You'll come to it sooner than a teetotaller like me, fillin yourself with gin at this hour o the mornin!
BILL
I'm no gin drinker, you old liar; but when I want to give my girl a bloomin good idin I like to av a bit o devil in me: see? An here I am, talkin to a rotten old blighter like you sted o givin her wot for.  I'm goin in there to fetch her out. .
SHIRLEY
You're goin to the station on a stretcher, more likely; and they'll take the gin and the devil out of you there when they get you inside. You mind what you're about: the major here is the Earl o Stevenage's granddaughter.
BILL
 Garn!
SHIRLEY
You'll see.
BILL
 Well, I ain't done nothin to er.
SHIRLEY
Spose she said you did! who'd believe you?
BILL
 Gawd! There's no jastice in this country. To think wot them people can do! I'm as good as er.
SHIRLEY
Tell her so. It's just what a fool like you would do.
Barbara, brisk and businesslike, comes from the shelter with a note book, and addresses herself to Shirley. Bill, cowed, sits down in the corner on a form, and turns his back on them.
BARBARA
Good morning.
SHIRLEY
 Good morning, miss.
BARBARA
Sit down: make yourself at home. . Now then! since you've made friends with us, we want to know all about you. Names and addresses and trades.
SHIRLEY
Peter Shirley. Fitter. Chucked out two months ago because I was too old.
BARBARA
 You'd pass still. Why didn't you dye your hair?
SHIRLEY
I did. Me age come out at a coroner's inquest on me daughter.
BARBARA
Steady?
SHIRLEY
Teetotaller. Never out of a job before. Good worker. And sent to the knockers like an old horse!
BARBARA
No matter: if you did your part God will do his.
SHIRLEY
 My religion's no concern of anybody but myself.
BARBARA
 I know. Secularist?
SHIRLEY
 Did I offer to deny it?
BARBARA
Why should you? My own father's a Secularist, I think. Our Father--yours and mine--fulfils himself in many ways; and I daresay he knew what he was about when he made a Secularist of you. So buck up, Peter! we can always find a job for a steady man like you. . What's your name?
BILL
 Wot's that to you?
BARBARA
 Afraid to give his name. Any trade?
BILL
Who's afraid to give his name?  If you want to bring a charge agen me, bring it. . My name's Bill Walker.
BARBARA
 Bill Walker?  Oh, I know: you're the man that Jenny Hill was praying for inside just now. .
BILL
Who's Jenny Hill? And what call has she to pray for me?
BARBARA
I don't know. Perhaps it was you that cut her lip.
BILL
 Yes, it was me that cut her lip. I ain't afraid o you.
BARBARA
How could you be, since you're not afraid of God? You're a brave man, Mr. Walker. It takes some pluck to do our work here; but none of us dare lift our hand against a girl like that, for fear of her father in heaven.
BILL
 I want none o your cantin jaw. I suppose you think I come here to beg from you, like this damaged lot here. Not me. I don't want your bread and scrape and catlap. I don't believe in your Gawd, no more than you do yourself.
BARBARA
 Oh, I beg your pardon for putting your name down, Mr. Walker. I didn't understand. I'll strike it out.
BILL
 Eah! you let my name alone. Ain't it good enough to be in your book?
BARBARA
 Well, you see, there's no use putting down your name unless I can do something for you, is there? What's your trade?
BILL
 That's no concern o yours.
BARBARA
Just so.  I'll put you down as  the man who--struck--poor little Jenny Hill--in the mouth.
BILL  See here. I've ad enough o this.
BARBARA
 What did you come to us for?
BILL
I come for my girl, see? I come to take her out o this and to break er jaws for her.
BARBARA
 You see I was right about your trade. . What's her name?
BILL
 Er name's Mog Abbijam: thats wot her name is.
BARBARA
Oh, she's gone to Canning Town, to our barracks there.
BILL
 is she?  Then I'm goin to Kennintahn arter her. . Are you lyin to me to get shut o me?
BARBARA
I don't want to get shut of you. I want to keep you here and save your soul. You'd better stay: you're going to have a bad time today, Bill.
BILL
Who's goin to give it to me? You, props.
BARBARA
Someone you don't believe in. But you'll be glad afterwards.
BILL
 I'll go to Kennintahn to be out o the reach o your tongue.  And if I don't find Mog there, I'll come back and do two years for you, selp me Gawd if I don't!
BARBARA
 It's no use, Bill. She's got another bloke.
BILL
Wot!
BARBARA
One of her own converts. He fell in love with her when he saw her with her soul saved, and her face clean, and her hair washed.
BILL
 Wottud she wash it for, the carroty slut? It's red.
BARBARA
It's quite lovely now, because she wears a new look in her eyes with it. It's a pity you're too late. The new bloke has put your nose out of joint, Bill.
BILL
I'll put his nose out o joint for him. Not that I care a curse for her, mind that. But I'll teach her to drop me as if I was dirt. And I'll teach him to meddle with my Judy. Wots iz bleedin name?
BARBARA
Sergeant Todger Fairmile.
SHIRLEY
 I'll go with him, miss. I want to see them two meet. I'll take him to the infirmary when it's over.
BILL
 Is that im you was speakin on?
SHIRLEY
That's him.
BILL
Im that wrastled in the music all?
SHIRLEY
The competitions at the National Sportin Club was worth nigh a hundred a year to him. He's gev em up now for religion; so he's a bit fresh for want of the exercise he was accustomed to. He'll be glad to see you. Come along.
BILL
Wots is weight?
SHIRLEY
Thirteen four. .
BARBARA
Go and talk to him, Bill. He'll convert you.
SHIRLEY
He'll convert your head into a mashed potato.
BILL
 I ain't afraid of him. I ain't afraid of ennybody. But he can lick me. She's done me. .
SHIRLEY
You ain't goin. I thought not. .
BARBARA
 Jenny!
JENNY
 Yes, Major.
BARBARA
Send Rummy Mitchens out to clear away here.
JENNY
I think she's afraid.
BARBARA
 Nonsense! she must do as she's told.
JENNY
 Rummy: the Major says you must come.
Jenny comes to Barbara, purposely keeping on the side next Bill, lest he should suppose that she shrank from him or bore malice.
BARBARA
Poor little Jenny! Are you tired?  Does it hurt?
JENNY
No: it's all right now. It was nothing.
BARBARA
 It was as hard as he could hit, I expect. Poor Bill! You don't feel angry with him, do you?
JENNY
Oh no, no, no: indeed I don't, Major, bless his poor heart! .
BARBARA
 Now Rummy, bustle. Take in those mugs and plates to be washed; and throw the crumbs about for the birds.
Rummy takes the three plates and mugs; but Shirley takes back his mug from her, as there it still come milk left in it.
RUMMY
There ain't any crumbs. This ain't a time to waste good bread on birds.
PRICE
 Gentleman come to see the shelter, Major. Says he's your father.
BARBARA
All right. Coming. .
RUMMY
 I'd av the lor of you, you flat eared pignosed potwalloper, if she'd let me. You're no gentleman, to hit a lady in the face. .
SHIRLEY
 Here! in with you and don't get yourself into more trouble by talking.
RUMMY
 I ain't ad the pleasure o being hintroduced to you, as I can remember. .
BILL
 Don't you talk to me, d'ye hear. You lea me alone, or I'll do you a mischief. I'm not dirt under your feet, anyway.
SHIRLEY
 Don't you be afeerd. You ain't such prime company that you need expect to be sought after. .
BARBARA
Oh there you are, Mr Shirley!  This is my father: I told you he was a Secularist, didn't I? Perhaps you'll be able to comfort one another.
UNDERSHAFT
 A Secularist! Not the least in the world: on the contrary, a confirmed mystic.
BARBARA
Sorry, I'm sure. By the way, papa, what is your religion--in case I have to introduce you again?
UNDERSHAFT
My religion? Well, my dear, I am a Millionaire. That is my religion.
BARBARA
Then I'm afraid you and Mr Shirley won't be able to comfort one another after all. You're not a Millionaire, are you, Peter?
SHIRLEY
No; and proud of it.
UNDERSHAFT
 Poverty, my friend, is not a thing to be proud of.
SHIRLEY
 Who made your millions for you? Me and my like. What's kep us poor? Keepin you rich. I wouldn't have your conscience, not for all your income.
UNDERSHAFT
I wouldn't have your income, not for all your conscience, Mr Shirley. .
BARBARA
 You wouldn't think he was my father, would you, Peter? Will you go into the shelter and lend the lasses a hand for a while: we're worked off our feet.
SHIRLEY
 Yes: I'm in their debt for a meal, ain't I?
BARBARA
Oh, not because you're in their debt; but for love of them, Peter, for love of them. . There! Don't stare at me. In with you; and give that conscience of yours a holiday .
SHIRLEY
 Ah! it's a pity you never was trained to use your reason, miss. You'd have been a very taking lecturer on Secularism.
Barbara turns to her father.
UNDERSHAFT
Never mind me, my dear. Go about your work; and let me watch it for a while.
BARBARA
All right.
UNDERSHAFT
For instance, what's the matter with that out-patient over there?
BARBARA
 Oh, we shall cure him in no time. Just watch. . It would be nice to just stamp on Mog Habbijam's face, wouldn't it, Bill?
BILL
 It's a lie: I never said so. . Who told you wot was in my mind?
BARBARA
Only your new friend.
BILL
Wot new friend?
BARBARA
The devil, Bill. When he gets round people they get miserable, just like you.
HILL
 I ain't miserable. .
BARBARA
Well, if you're happy, why don't you look happy, as we do?
BILL
 I'm appy enough, I tell you. Why don't you lea me alown? Wot av I done to you? I ain't smashed your face, av I?
BARBARA
 It's not me that's getting at you, Bill.
BILL
Who else is it?
BARBARA
Somebody that doesn't intend you to smash women's faces, I suppose. Somebody or something that wants to make a man of you.
BILL
 Make a man o ME! Ain't I a man? eh? ain't I a man? Who sez I'm not a man?
BARBARA
There's a man in you somewhere, I suppose. But why did he let you hit poor little Jenny Hill? That wasn't very manly of him, was it?
BILL
 Av done with it, I tell you. Chock it. I'm sick of your Jenny Ill and er silly little face.
BARBARA
Then why do you keep thinking about it? Why does it keep coming up against you in your mind? You're not getting converted, are you?
BILL
 Not ME. Not likely. Not arf.
BARBARA
That's right, Bill. Hold out against it. Put out your strength. Don't let's get you cheap. Todger Fairmile said he wrestled for three nights against his Salvation harder than he ever wrestled with the Jap at the music hall. He gave in to the Jap when his arm was going to break. But he didn't give in to his salvation until his heart was going to break. Perhaps you'll escape that. You haven't any heart, have you?
BILL
Wot dye mean? Wy ain't I got a art the same as ennybody else?
BARBARA
A man with a heart wouldn't have bashed poor little Jenny's face, would he?
BILL
 Ow, will you lea me alown? Av I ever offered to meddle with you, that you come noggin and provowkin me lawk this?
.
BARBARA
 It's your soul that's hurting you, Bill, and not me. We've been through it all ourselves. Come with us, Bill. . To brave manhood on earth and eternal glory in heaven. . Come. . Oh! there you are, Dolly. Let me introduce a new friend of mine, Mr Bill Walker. This is my bloke, Bill: Mr Cusins. .
BILL
Goin to marry im?
BARBARA
Yes.
BILL
 Gawd elp im! Gawd elp im!
BARBARA
Why? Do you think he won't be happy with me?
BILL
I've only ad to stand it for a mornin: e'll av to stand it for a lifetime.
CUSINS
That is a frightful reflection, Mr Walker. But I can't tear myself away from her.
BILL
Well, I can.  Eah! do you know where I'm goin to, and wot I'm goin to do?
BARBARA
Yes: you're going to heaven; and you're coming back here before the week's out to tell me so.
BILL
You lie. I'm goin to Kennintahn, to spit in Todger Fairmile's eye. I bashed Jenny Ill's face; and now I'll get me own face bashed and come back and show it to er. E'll it me ardern I it er. That'll make us square.  Is that fair or is it not? You're a genlmn: you oughter know.
BARBARA
Two black eyes won't make one white one, Bill.
BILL
I didn't ast you. Cawn't you never keep your mahth shut? I ast the genlmn.
CUSINS
 Yes: I think you're right, Mr Walker. Yes: I should do it. It's curious: it's exactly what an ancient Greek would have done.
BARBARA
But what good will it do?
CUSINS
Well, it will give Mr Fairmile some exercise; and it will satisfy Mr Walker's soul.
BILL
Rot! there ain't no sach a thing as a soul. Ah kin you tell wether I've a soul or not? You never seen it.
BARBARA
I've seen it hurting you when you went against it.
BILL
 If you was my girl and took the word out o me mahth lawk thet, I'd give you suthink you'd feel urtin, so I would.  You take my tip, mate. Stop er jawr; or you'll die afore your time.  Wore aht: thets wot you'll be: wore aht. .
CUSINS
 I wonder!
BARBARA
Dolly! .
CUSINS
Yes, my dear, it's very wearing to be in love with you. If it lasts, I quite think I shall die young.
BARBARA
Should you mind?
CUSINS
Not at all. .
BARBARA
It's all right, papa, we've not forgotten you. Dolly: explain the place to papa: I haven't time. .
Undershaft and Adolpbus now have the yard to themselves. Undershaft, seated on a form, and still keenly attentive, looks hard at Adolphus. Adolphus looks hard at him.
UNDERSHAFT
I fancy you guess something of what is in my mind, Mr Cusins. . Exactly so. But suppose Barbara finds you out!
CUSINS
You know, I do not admit that I am imposing on Barbara. I am quite genuinely interested in the views of the Salvation Army. The fact is, I am a sort of collector of religions; and the curious thing is that I find I can believe them all. By the way, have you any religion?
UNDERSHAFT
Yes.
CUSINS
Anything out of the common?
UNDERSHAFT
Only that there are two things necessary to Salvation.
CUSINS
 Ah, the Church Catechism. Charles Lomax also belongs to the Established Church.
UNDERSHAFT
The two things are--
CUSINS
Baptism and--
UNDERSHAFT
No. Money and gunpowder.
CUSINS
 That is the general opinion of our governing classes. The novelty is in hearing any man confess it.
UNDERSHAFT
Just so.
CUSINS
Excuse me: is there any place in your religion for honor, justice, truth, love, mercy and so forth?
UNDERSHAFT
Yes: they are the graces and luxuries of a rich, strong, and safe life.
CUSINS
Suppose one is forced to choose between them and money or gunpowder?
UNDERSHAFT
Choose money and gunpowder; for without enough of both you cannot afford the others.
CUSINS
That is your religion?
UNDERSHAFT
Yes.
The cadence of this reply makes a full close in the conversation. Cusins twists his face dubiously and contemplates Undershaft. Undershaft contemplates him.
CUSINS
Barbara won't stand that. You will have to choose between your religion and Barbara.
UNDERSHAFT
So will you, my friend. She will find out that that drum of yours is hollow.
CUSINS
Father Undershaft: you are mistaken: I am a sincere Salvationist. You do not understand the Salvation Army. It is the army of joy, of love, of courage: it has banished the fear and remorse and despair of the old hellridden evangelical sects: it marches to fight the devil with trumpet and drum, with music and dancing, with banner and palm, as becomes a sally from heaven by its happy garrison. It picks the waster out of the public house and makes a man of him: it finds a worm wriggling in a back kitchen, and lo! a woman! Men and women of rank too, sons and daughters of the Highest. It takes the poor professor of Greek, the most artificial and self-suppressed of human creatures, from his meal of roots, and lets loose the rhapsodist in him; reveals the true worship of Dionysos to him; sends him down the public street drumming dithyrambs .
UNDERSHAFT
You will alarm the shelter.
CUSINS
Oh, they are accustomed to these sudden ecstasies of piety. However, if the drum worries you-- .
UNDERSHAFT
Thank you.
CUSINS
You remember what Euripides says about your money and gunpowder?
UNDERSHAFT
No.
CUSINS
One and another
In money and guns may outpass his brother;
And men in their millions float and flow
And seethe with a million hopes as leaven;
And they win their will; or they miss their will;
And their hopes are dead or are pined for still:
But whoe'er can know
As the long days go
That to live is happy, has found his heaven.
My translation: what do you think of it?
UNDERSHAFT
I think, my friend, that if you wish to know, as the long days go, that to live is happy, you must first acquire money enough for a decent life, and power enough to be your own master.
CUSINS
You are damnably discouraging. .
Is it so hard a thing to see
That the spirit of God--whate'er it be--
The Law that abides and changes not, ages long,
The Eternal and Nature-born: these things be strong.
What else is Wisdom? What of Man's endeavor,
Or God's high grace so lovely and so great?
To stand from fear set free? to breathe and wait?
To hold a hand uplifted over Fate?
And shall not Barbara be loved for ever?
UNDERSHAFT
Euripides mentions Barbara, does he?
CUSINS
It is a fair translation. The word means Loveliness.
UNDERSHAFT
May I ask--as Barbara's father--how much a year she is to be loved for ever on?
CUSINS
As Barbara's father, that is more your affair than mine. I can feed her by teaching Greek: that is about all.
UNDERSHAFT
Do you consider it a good match for her?
CUSINS
 Mr Undershaft: I am in many ways a weak, timid, ineffectual person; and my health is far from satisfactory. But whenever I feel that I must have anything, I get it, sooner or later. I feel that way about Barbara. I don't like marriage: I feel intensely afraid of it; and I don't know what I shall do with Barbara or what she will do with me. But I feel that I and nobody else must marry her. Please regard that as settled.--Not that I wish to be arbitrary; but why should I waste your time in discussing what is inevitable?
UNDERSHAFT
You mean that you will stick at nothing not even the conversion of the Salvation Army to the worship of Dionysos.
CUSINS
The business of the Salvation Army is to save, not to wrangle about the name of the pathfinder. Dionysos or another: what does it matter?
UNDERSHAFT
 Professor Cusins you are a young man after my own heart.
CUSINS
Mr Undershaft: you are, as far as I am able to gather, a most infernal old rascal; but you appeal very strongly to my sense of ironic humor.
Undershaft mutely offers his hand. They shake.
UNDERSHAFT
 And now to business.
CUSINS
Pardon me. We were discussing religion. Why go back to such an uninteresting and unimportant subject as business?
UNDERSHAFT
Religion is our business at present, because it is through religion alone that we can win Barbara.
CUSINS
Have you, too, fallen in love with Barbara?
UNDERSHAFT
Yes, with a father's love.
CUSINS
A father's love for a grown-up daughter is the most dangerous of all infatuations. I apologize for mentioning my own pale, coy, mistrustful fancy in the same breath with it.
UNDERSHAFT
Keep to the point. We have to win her; and we are neither of us Methodists.
CUSINS
That doesn't matter. The power Barbara wields here--the power that wields Barbara herself--is not Calvinism, not Presbyterianism, not Methodism--
UNDERSHAFT
Not Greek Paganism either, eh?
CUSINS
I admit that. Barbara is quite original in her religion.
UNDERSHAFT
 Aha! Barbara Undershaft would be. Her inspiration comes from within herself.
CUSINS
How do you suppose it got there?
UNDERSHAFT
 It is the Undershaft inheritance. I shall hand on my torch to my daughter. She shall make my converts and preach my gospel.
CUSINS
What! Money and gunpowder!
UNDERSHAFT
Yes, money and gunpowder; freedom and power; command of life and command of death.
CUSINS
 This is extremely interesting, Mr Undershaft. Of course you know that you are mad.
UNDERSHAFT
 And you?
CUSINS
Oh, mad as a hatter. You are welcome to my secret since I have discovered yours. But I am astonished. Can a madman make cannons?
UNDERSHAFT
Would anyone else than a madman make them? And now  question for question. Can a sane man translate Euripides?
CUSINS
No.
UNDERSHAFT
 Can a sane woman make a man of a waster or a woman of a worm?
CUSINS
 Father Colossus--Mammoth Millionaire--
UNDERSHAFT
 Are there two mad people or three in this Salvation shelter to-day?
CUSINS
You mean Barbara is as mad as we are!
UNDERSHAFT
 Pooh, Professor! let us call things by their proper names. I am a millionaire; you are a poet; Barbara is a savior of souls. What have we three to do with the common mob of slaves and idolaters? .
CUSINS
Take care! Barbara is in love with the common people. So am I. Have you never felt the romance of that love?
UNDERSHAFT
 Have you ever been in love with Poverty, like St Francis? Have you ever been in love with Dirt, like St Simeon? Have you ever been in love with disease and suffering, like our nurses and philanthropists? Such passions are not virtues, but the most unnatural of all the vices. This love of the common people may please an earl's granddaughter and a university professor; but I have been a common man and a poor man; and it has no romance for me. Leave it to the poor to pretend that poverty is a blessing: leave it to the coward to make a religion of his cowardice by preaching humility: we know better than that. We three must stand together above the common people: how else can we help their children to climb up beside us? Barbara must belong to us, not to the Salvation Army.
CUSINS
Well, I can only say that if you think you will get her away from the Salvation Army by talking to her as you have been talking to me, you don't know Barbara.
UNDERSHAFT
My friend: I never ask for what I can buy.
CUSINS
 Do I understand you to imply that you can buy Barbara?
UNDERSHAFT
No; but I can buy the Salvation Army.
CUSINS
Quite impossible.
UNDERSHAFT
You shall see. All religious organizations exist by selling themselves to the rich.
CUSINS
Not the Army. That is the Church of the poor.
UNDERSHAFT
All the more reason for buying it.
CUSINS
I don't think you quite know what the Army does for the poor.
UNDERSHAFT
Oh yes I do. It draws their teeth: that is enough for me--as a man of business--
CUSINS
Nonsense! It makes them sober--
UNDERSHAFT
I prefer sober workmen. The profits are larger.
CUSINS
--honest--
UNDERSHAFT
Honest workmen are the most economical.
CUSINS
--attached to their homes--
UNDERSHAFT
So much the better: they will put up with anything sooner than change their shop.
CUSINS
--happy--
UNDERSHAFT
An invaluable safeguard against revolution.
CUSINS
--unselfish--
UNDERSHAFT
Indifferent to their own interests, which suits me exactly.
CUSINS
--with their thoughts on heavenly things--
UNDERSHAFT
 And not on Trade Unionism nor Socialism. Excellent.
CUSINS
 You really are an infernal old rascal.
UNDERSHAFT
 And this is an honest man!
SHIRLEY
Yes; and what av I got by it? .
Snobby Price, beaming sanctimoniously, and Jenny Hill, with a tambourine full of coppers, come from the shelter and go to the drum, on which Jenny begins to count the money.
UNDERSHAFT
 Oh, your employers must have got a good deal by it from first to last. .
BARBARA
We've just had a splendid experience meeting at the other gate in Cripps's lane. I've hardly ever seen them so much moved as they were by your confession, Mr Price.
PRICE
I could almost be glad of my past wickedness if I could believe that it would elp to keep hathers stright.
BARBARA
So it will, Snobby. How much, Jenny?
JENNY
Four and tenpence, Major.
BARBARA
Oh Snobby, if you had given your poor mother just one more kick, we should have got the whole five shillings!
PRICE
If she heard you say that, miss, she'd be sorry I didn't. But I'm glad. Oh what a joy it will be to her when she hears I'm saved!
UNDERSHAFT
Shall I contribute the odd twopence, Barbara? The millionaire's mite, eh? 
BARBARA
How did you make that twopence?
UNDERSHAFT
As usual. By selling cannons, torpedoes, submarines, and my new patent Grand Duke hand grenade.
BARBARA
Put it back in your pocket. You can't buy your Salvation here for twopence: you must work it out.
UNDERSHAFT
Is twopence not enough? I can afford a little more, if you press me.
BARBARA
Two million millions would not be enough. There is bad blood on your hands; and nothing but good blood can cleanse them. Money is no use. Take it away. . Dolly: you must write another letter for me to the papers. . Yes: I know you don't like it; but it must be done. The starvation this winter is beating us: everybody is unemployed. The General says we must close this shelter if we can't get more money. I force the collections at the meetings until I am ashamed, don't I, Snobby?
PRICE
It's a fair treat to see you work it, miss. The way you got them up from three-and-six to four-and-ten with that hymn, penny by penny and verse by verse, was a caution. Not a Cheap Jack on Mile End Waste could touch you at it.
BARBARA
Yes; but I wish we could do without it. I am getting at last to think more of the collection than of the people's souls. And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence? We want thousands! tens of thousands! hundreds of thousands! I want to convert people, not to be always begging for the Army in a way I'd die sooner than beg for myself.
UNDERSHAFT
 Genuine unselfishness is capable of anything, my dear.
BARBARA
 Yes, isn't it? .
CUSINS
 Mephistopheles! Machiavelli!
BARBARA
 How are we to feed them? I can't talk religion to a man with bodily hunger in his eyes.  It's frightful.
JENNY
 Major, dear--
BARBARA
 No: don't comfort me. It will be all right. We shall get the money.
UNDERSHAFT
How?
JENNY
By praying for it, of course. Mrs Baines says she prayed for it last night; and she has never prayed for it in vain: never once. .
BARBARA
 By the way, dad, Mrs Baines has come to march with us to our big meeting this afternoon; and she is very anxious to meet you, for some reason or other. Perhaps she'll convert you.
UNDERSHAFT
I shall be delighted, my dear.
JENNY
 Major! Major! Here's that man back again.
BARBARA
What man?
JENNY
The man that hit me. Oh, I hope he's coming back to join us.
Bill Walker, with frost on his jacket, comes through the gate, his hands deep in his pockets and his chin sunk between his shoulders, like a cleaned-out gambler. He halts between Barbara and the drum.
BARBARA
Hullo, Bill! Back already!
BILL
 Bin talkin ever sense, av you?
BARBARA
Pretty nearly. Well, has Todger paid you out for poor Jenny's jaw?
BILL
NO he ain't.
BARBARA
I thought your jacket looked a bit snowy.
BILL
So it is snowy. You want to know where the snow come from, don't you?
BARBARA
Yes.
BILL
Well, it come from off the ground in Parkinses Corner in Kennintahn. It got rubbed off be my shoulders see?
BARBARA
Pity you didn't rub some off with your knees, Bill! That would have done you a lot of good.
BILL
 I was saving another man's knees at the time. E was kneelin on my ed, so e was.
JENNY
Who was kneeling on your head?
BILL
Todger was. E was prayin for me: prayin comfortable with me as a carpet. So was Mog. So was the ole bloomin meetin. Mog she sez "O Lord break is stubborn spirit; but don't urt is dear art." That was wot she said. "Don't urt is dear art"! An er bloke--thirteen stun four!--kneelin wiv all is weight on me. Funny, ain't it?
JENNY
Oh no. We're so sorry, Mr Walker.
BARBARA
 Nonsense! of course it's funny. Served you right, Bill! You must have done something to him first.
BILL
 I did wot I said I'd do. I spit in is eye. E looks up at the sky and sez, "O that I should be fahnd worthy to be spit upon for the gospel's sake!" a sez; an Mog sez "Glory Allelloolier!"; an then a called me Brother, an dahned me as if I was a kid and a was me mother washin me a Setterda nawt. I adn't just no show wiv im at all. Arf the street prayed; an the tother arf larfed fit to split theirselves.  There! are you settisfawd nah?
BARBARA
 Wish I'd been there, Bill.
BILL
Yes: you'd a got in a hextra bit o talk on me, wouldn't you?
JENNY
I'm so sorry, Mr. Walker.
BILL
 Don't you go bein sorry for me: you've no call. Listen ere. I broke your jawr.
JENNY
No, it didn't hurt me: indeed it didn't, except for a moment. It was only that I was frightened.
BILL
I don't want to be forgive be you, or be ennybody. Wot I did I'll pay for. I tried to get me own jawr broke to settisfaw you--
JENNY
 Oh no--
BILL
 Tell y'I did: cawn't you listen to wot's bein told you? All I got be it was bein made a sight of in the public street for me pains. Well, if I cawn't settisfaw you one way, I can another. Listen ere! I ad two quid saved agen the frost; an I've a pahnd of it left. A mate n mine last week ad words with the Judy e's goin to marry. E give er wot-for; an e's bin fined fifteen bob. E ad a right to it er because they was goin to be marrid; but I adn't no right to it you; so put anather fawv bob on an call it a pahnd's worth. . Ere's the money. Take it; and let's av no more o your forgivin an prayin and your Major jawrin me. Let wot I done be done and paid for; and let there be a end of it.
JENNY
Oh, I couldn't take it, Mr. Walker. But if you would give a shilling or two to poor Rummy Mitchens! you really did hurt her; and she's old.
BILL
 Not likely. I'd give her anather as soon as look at er. Let her av the lawr o me as she threatened! She ain't forgiven me: not mach. Wot I done to er is not on me mawnd--wot she  might call on me conscience--no more than stickin a pig. It's this Christian game o yours that I won't av played agen me: this bloomin forgivin an noggin an jawrin that makes a man that sore that iz lawf's a burdn to im. I won't av it, I tell you; so take your money and stop throwin your silly bashed face hup agen me.
JENNY
Major: may I take a little of it for the Army?
BARBARA
No: the Army is not to be bought. We want your soul, Bill; and we'll take nothing less.
BILL
 I know. It ain't enough. Me an me few shillins is not good enough for you. You're a earl's grendorter, you are. Nothin less than a underd pahnd for you.
UNDERSHAFT
Come, Barbara! you could do a great deal of good with a hundred pounds. If you will set this gentleman's mind at ease by taking his pound, I will give the other ninety-nine .
BARBARA
Oh, you're too extravagant, papa. Bill offers twenty pieces of silver. All you need offer is the other ten. That will make the standard price to buy anybody who's for sale. I'm not; and the Army's not.  You'll never have another quiet moment, Bill, until you come round to us. You can't stand out against your salvation.
BILL
 I cawn't stend aht agen music all wrastlers and artful tongued women. I've offered to pay. I can do no more. Take it or leave it. There it is. .
Mrs Baines comes from the shelter. She is dressed as a Salvation Army Commissioner. She is an earnest looking woman of about 40, with a caressing, urgent voice, and an appealing manner.
BARBARA
This is my father, Mrs Baines. . Try what you can do with him. He won't listen to me, because he remembers what a fool I was when I was a baby.
.
MRS BAINES
Have you been shown over the shelter, Mr Undershaft? You know the work we're doing, of course.
UNDERSHAFT
 The whole nation knows it, Mrs Baines.
MRS BAINES
No, Sir: the whole nation does not know it, or we should not be crippled as we are for want of money to carry our work through the length and breadth of the land. Let me tell you that there would have been rioting this winter in London but for us.
UNDERSHAFT
You really think so?
MRS BAINES
I know it. I remember 1886, when you rich gentlemen hardened your hearts against the cry of the poor. They broke the windows of your clubs in Pall Mall.
UNDERSHAFT
 And the Mansion House Fund went up next day from thirty thousand pounds to seventy-nine thousand! I remember quite well.
MRS BAINES
Well, won't you help me to get at the people? They won't break windows then. Come here, Price. Let me show you to this gentleman . Do you remember the window breaking?
PRICE
My ole father thought it was the revolution, ma'am.
MRS BAINES
Would you break windows now?
PRICE
Oh no ma'm. The windows of eaven av bin opened to me. I know now that the rich man is a sinner like myself.
RUMMY
 Snobby Price!
SNOBBY
Wot is it?
RUMMY
Your mother's askin for you at the other gate in Crippses Lane. She's heard about your confession .
MRS BAINES
Go, Mr. Price; and pray with her.
JENNY
You can go through the shelter, Snobby.
PRICE
 I couldn't face her now; ma'am, with all the weight of my sins fresh on me. Tell her she'll find her son at ome, waitin for her in prayer. .
MRS BAINES
 You see how we take the anger and the bitterness against you out of their hearts, Mr Undershaft.
UNDERSHAFT
It is certainly most convenient and gratifying to all large employers of labor, Mrs Baines.
MRS BAINES
Barbara: Jenny: I have good news: most wonderful news. . My prayers have been answered. I told you they would, Jenny, didn't I?
JENNY
Yes, yes.
BARBARA
 Have we got money enough to keep the shelter open?
MRS BAINES
I hope we shall have enough to keep all the shelters open. Lord Saxmundham has promised us five thousand pounds--
BARBARA
Hooray!
JENNY
Glory!
MRS BAINES
--if--
BARBARA
"If!" If what?
MRS BAINES
If five other gentlemen will give a thousand each to make it up to ten thousand.
BARBARA
Who is Lord Saxmundham? I never heard of him.
UNDERSHAFT
 A new creation, my dear. You have heard of Sir Horace Bodger?
BARBARA
Bodger! Do you mean the distiller? Bodger's whisky!
UNDERSHAFT
That is the man. He is one of the greatest of our public benefactors. He restored the cathedral at Hakington. They made him a baronet for that. He gave half a million to the funds of his party: they made him a baron for that.
SHIRLEY
What will they give him for the five thousand?
UNDERSHAFT
There is nothing left to give him. So the five thousand, I should think, is to save his soul.
MRS BAINES
Heaven grant it may! Oh Mr. Undershaft, you have some very rich friends. Can't you help us towards the other five thousand? We are going to hold a great meeting this afternoon at the Assembly Hall in the Mile End Road. If I could only announce that one gentleman had come forward to support Lord Saxmundham, others would follow. Don't you know somebody? Couldn't you? Wouldn't you?  oh, think of those poor people, Mr Undershaft: think of how much it means to them, and how little to a great man like you.
UNDERSHAFT
 Mrs Baines: you are irresistible. I can't disappoint you; and I can't deny myself the satisfaction of making Bodger pay up. You shall have your five thousand pounds.
MRS BAINES
Thank God!
UNDERSHAFT
You don't thank me?
MRS BAINES
Oh sir, don't try to be cynical: don't be ashamed of being a good man. The Lord will bless you abundantly; and our prayers will be like a strong fortification round you all the days of your life.  You will let me have the cheque to show at the meeting, won't you? Jenny: go in and fetch a pen and ink. .
UNDERSHAFT
Do not disturb Miss Hill: I have a fountain pen. .
BILL
 Wot prawce Selvytion nah?
BARBARA
Stop. . Mrs Baines: are you really going to take this money?
MRS BAINES
 Why not, dear?
BARBARA
Why not! Do you know what my father is? Have you forgotten that Lord Saxmundham is Bodger the whisky man? Do you remember how we implored the County Council to stop him from writing Bodger's Whisky in letters of fire against the sky; so that the poor drinkruined creatures on the embankment could not wake up from their snatches of sleep without being reminded of their deadly thirst by that wicked sky sign? Do you know that the worst thing I have had to fight here is not the devil, but Bodger, Bodger, Bodger, with his whisky, his distilleries, and his tied houses? Are you going to make our shelter another tied house for him, and ask me to keep it?
BILL
Rotten drunken whisky it is too.
MRS BAINES
Dear Barbara: Lord Saxmundham has a soul to be saved like any of us. If heaven has found the way to make a good use of his money, are we to set ourselves up against the answer to our prayers?
BARBARA. I know he has a soul to be saved. Let him come down here; and I'll do my best to help him to his salvation. But he wants to send his cheque down to buy us, and go on being as wicked as ever.
UNDERSHAFT  My dear Barbara: alcohol is a very necessary article. It heals the sick--
BARBARA
It does nothing of the sort.
UNDERSHAFT
Well, it assists the doctor: that is perhaps a less questionable way of putting it. It makes life bearable to millions of people who could not endure their existence if they were quite sober. It enables Parliament to do things at eleven at night that no sane person would do at eleven in the morning. Is it Bodger's fault that this inestimable gift is deplorably abused by less than one per cent of the poor? .
MRS BAINES
Barbara: will there be less drinking or more if all those poor souls we are saving come to-morrow and find the doors of our shelters shut in their faces? Lord Saxmundham gives us the money to stop drinking--to take his own business from him.
CUSINS
 Pure self-sacrifice on Bodger's part, clearly! Bless dear Bodger! [Barbara almost breaks down as Adolpbus, too,
fails her].
UNDERSHAFT
 I also, Mrs Baines, may claim a little disinterestedness. Think of my business! think of the widows and orphans! the men and lads torn to pieces with shrapnel and poisoned with lyddite ! the oceans of blood, not one drop of which is shed in a really just cause! the ravaged crops! the peaceful peasants forced, women and men, to till their fields under the fire of opposing armies on pain of starvation! the bad blood of the fierce little cowards at home who egg on others to fight for the gratification of their national vanity! All this makes money for me: I am never richer, never busier than when the papers are full of it. Well, it is your work to preach peace on earth and goodwill to men. . Every convert you make is a vote against war. . Yet I give you this money to help you to hasten my own commercial ruin. .
CUSINS
 The millennium will be inaugurated by the unselfishness of Undershaft and Bodger. Oh be joyful! .
MRS BAINES
 The longer I live the more proof I see that there is an Infinite Goodness that turns everything to the work of salvation sooner or later. Who would have thought that any good could have come out of war and drink? And yet their profits are brought today to the feet of salvation to do its blessed work. .
JENNY
 Oh dear! how blessed, how glorious it all is!
CUSINS  Let us seize this unspeakable moment. Let us march to the great meeting at once. Excuse me just an instant. .
MRS BAINES
Mr Undershaft: have you ever seen a thousand people fall on their knees with one impulse and pray? Come with us to the meeting. Barbara shall tell them that the Army is saved, and saved through you.
CUSINS
 You shall carry the flag down the first street, Mrs Baines . Mr Undershaft is a gifted trombonist: he shall intone an Olympian diapason to the West Ham Salvation March.  Blow, Machiavelli, blow.
UNDERSHAFT
 The trumpet in Zion!  I will do my best. I could vamp a bass if I knew the tune.
CUSINS
It is a wedding chorus from one of Donizetti's operas; but we have converted it. We convert everything to good here, including Bodger. You remember the chorus. "For thee immense rejoicing--immenso giubilo--immenso giubilo."  Rum tum ti tum tum, tum tum ti ta--
BARBARA
Dolly: you are breaking my heart.
CUSINS
What is a broken heart more or less here? Dionysos Undershaft has descended. I am possessed.
MRS BAINES. Come, Barbara: I must have my dear Major to carry the flag with me.
JENNY
Yes, yes, Major darling.
CUSINS
.
BARBARA
 I can't come.
JENNY
Not come!
MRS BAINES
 Barbara: do you think I am wrong to take the money?
BARBARA
 No, no: God help you, dear, you must: you are saving the Army. Go; and may you have a great meeting!
JENNY
But arn't you coming?
BARBARA
No. .
MRS BAINES
Barbara: what are you doing?
JENNY
Why are you taking your badge off? You can't be going to leave us, Major.
BARBARA
 Father: come here.
UNDERSHAFT
 My dear! .
BARBARA
 Don't be frightened.  There! It's not much for 5000 pounds is it?
MRS BAINES
Barbara: if you won't come and pray with us, promise me you will pray for us.
BARBARA
I can't pray now. Perhaps I shall never pray again.
MRS BAINES
Barbara!
JENNY
Major!
BARBARA
 I can't bear any more. Quick march!
CUSINS
 Off we go. Play up, there! Immenso giubilo. .
MRS BAINES
I must go, dear. You're overworked: you will be all right tomorrow. We'll never lose you. Now Jenny: step out with the old flag. Blood and Fire! .
JENNY
Glory Hallelujah! .
UNDERSHAFT
 "My ducats and my daughter"!
CUSINS
 Money and gunpowder!
BARBARA
Drunkenness and Murder! My God: why hast thou forsaken me?
She sinks on the form with her face buried in her hands. The march passes away into silence. Bill Walker steals across to her.
BILL
 Wot prawce Selvytion nah?
SHIRLEY
Don't you hit her when she's down.
BILL
She it me wen aw wiz dahn. Waw shouldn't I git a bit o me own back?
BARBARA
 I didn't take your money, Bill. .
BILL
 Naow, it warn't enough for you. . Ellow! If you ain't took it summun else az. Were's it gorn? Blame me if Jenny Ill didn't take it arter all!
RUMMY
 You lie, you dirty blackguard! Snobby Price pinched it off the drum wen e took ap iz cap. I was ap ere all the time an see im do it.
BILL
Wot! Stowl maw money! Waw didn't you call thief on him, you silly old mucker you?
RUMMY
To serve you aht for ittin me acrost the face. It's cost y'pahnd, that az.  I done you. I'm even with you. I've ad it aht o y--. .
BILL
