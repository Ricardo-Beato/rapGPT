Watch what you say'n,we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
We ain't playing with you boys, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch what you say'n,we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
We ain't playing with you boys, we ain't playing with you boys

Watch what you say'n, you better watch out where you lay
Fuck with my clique and Lil J, 

 sit back and meditate and regulate
Sit back and set it straight
F with me you 
Come 
We  bout to operate
 my life I dedicate

 wanna see cash
Everyday might be my last
Living like this 
 make a dash
Put your ass all in the back
You might be bad but 
You might also like
Watch what you say'n,we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
We ain't playing with you boys, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch what you say'n,we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
We ain't playing with you boys, we ain't playing with you boys

 lips, ankle poppin hips
Call Lil J up, and call 
 Crips
 got you running like a woman
Make it a bloody mess, cause you wanted to test
 gon get wet
 blasting techs
I ain't high 
 to the death
Beest believe that 
Busting on a y'all teacher's pets
If you disrespect, we bring drama to your set
, tear your block up in a day
Watch what you say'n,we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
We ain't playing with you boys, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch what you say'n,we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
We ain't playing with you boys, we ain't playing with you boys

 of course
AK, more magazines than the Vibe and The Source
I got it from here, shoot up your mama house
 I'm coming to find you
When I find you, they gon find your ass too
I don't know who the fuck you think you're playing with
You don't want beef, watch what you're saying 
Right fuckin plan, with the wrong fuckin man
I ain't with that bullshit, I don't be playin
 ain't nothing fake about me
You better watch what the fuck you say'n bout me

Watch what you say'n,we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
We ain't playing with you boys, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch what you say'n,we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
Watch watch what you say'n, we ain't playing with you boys
We ain't playing with you boys, we ain't playing with you boysEmbed
