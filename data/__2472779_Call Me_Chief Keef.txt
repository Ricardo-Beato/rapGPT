21 ContributorsCall Me Lyrics
Sosa, what the fuck you been on?
You can call me Lord Theodore
You can call me Lord Farquaad
Call me Lord, yeah, boy
Call me Lord of the Rings
Call me lord of the chains
Call me lord of the cars
Call me lord of the gang

She think it's Purple Rain like Prince
These blue hundreds, what you colorblind, bitch?
The same nigga, how they think that I'm gonna switch?
Break his ass like a Kit-Kat, ayy, 'cause he think that I'm a bitch
Out in Cali' with the shit
Ride foreign, foenem riding on the switch
Low rider how this Glock start hip-hop
Put some spots on his ass, yeah, chicken pox him
Red dot on his nose, yeah, Rudolph him
Do you need extermination? I got tools on me
Rolled up on your bitch and she drooled on me
She said, "That nigga got his check and he blew it on me"
I said, "Bitch, I don't care, I don't give a fuck"
You'd think I'm from Baltimore how I wheelie up
Who the bosses in this shit? Ayy, really us
You think you funny? Damn right, you be killing us
You might also like
Sosa, what the fuck you been on?
You can call me Lord Theodore
You can call me Lord Farquaad
Call me Lord, yeah, boy
Call me Lord of the Rings
Call me lord of the chains
Call me lord of the cars
Call me lord of the gang, bang

Call me lord of the beats, lord of the streets
Got your bitch in my room going under sheets
Call me lord of the century, lord of the week
Call me lord of the turnt, lord of the T
That bitch ain't shit but the lord of bugging me
These niggas ain't shit but the lord of hugging me
They talk behind my back, get smacked if you come at me
I'm tweaking, how these hoes be fucking me? They said I was ugly
Bitch seen the blue light in my car, she wanna come with me
Bitch, I gotta win this race, you can't run with me
Want war, we can tug-o'
Fuck a fight, boy, my chopper love to tussle
You think you off the drink, you sippin' Robitussin
What Chief So' on? He always on to something
Two outfits, I pass one to my cousin
Ain't no love baby, yes, a bunch of lusting, ayy, buzzin'
Sosa, what the fuck you been on?
You can call me Lord Theodore
You can call me Lord Farquaad
Call me Lord, yeah, boy
Call me Lord of the Rings
Call me lord of the chains
Call me lord of the cars
Call me lord of the gang1Embed
