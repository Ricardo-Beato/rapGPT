212 ContributorsWe Made You Lyrics
Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby) (Yeah)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
"Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!"
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can, Ken, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But, Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a two; you're practically a ten
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl
You might also like
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you checking me out
And, baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
"Lord, help us, he's back in his pink ALF shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

So baby
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down, down
Baby, get down, get down
Oh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha-ha, woo!
Dr. Dre! 2020!
Yeah!67Embed
