4 ContributorsNever Seen These LyricsI never seen these

My Gucci's got bumps on the toes
Alligator wrapped round the sole
You can't find these in stores
You ain't never seen these
High top Loius V checkerboard
Walkin' like I'm walkin' on the moon
I'mma Louis V tycoon (Space shit nigga
You ain't never seen these

Put the Louis on like I'm bout to go runnin
Runnin' to the money while the money steady comin'
Hey, checkerboard jacket  (Louis)
Add on the shoes 4 racks without taxes
Yeea, I'm Louis V tycoonin'
I took off to the moon'n, my belt my pants say Louis
I shop so much in Louie, you'll swear the kid was boosting
The scarfs and shades, the wallets, chains
I swear I try to buy everything
I hop on the plane, flyer than the plane, what's my designer name, bitch I think I'm rick James, fashion
Is my passion, coordinated ain't ordinary how I'm actin, Isee you swagga snacking

My Gucci's got bumps on the toes
Alligator wrapped round the sole
You can't find these in the store
You ain't never seen these
High top Loius V checkerboard
Walkin' like I'm walkin on the moon
I'mma Louis V tycoon (Space shit nigga)
You ain't never seen these

Underground King Pimp C, Bun B
Yeea, gone & show the swagga, astronaut forever rockstar Mcjagger, yeea
I'mma set my trend again
Put spikes on Louis V tens, them Chuck Taylors out dated
I'm bringin them back again
For sho, for sure, i kill them in contour, shit on you cow manure
I'm fly like avatar, yea I meant avatar, the guru took you far, went to pluto in mars, the start of total war
You tryna' fin these, can't find these in america, I walk on m&m's, Man I'm too bizarre
[Hook
My Gucci's got bumps on the toes
Alligator wrapped round the sole
You can't find these in the store
You ain't never seen these
High top Loius V checkerboard
Walkin' like I'm walkin on the moon
I'mma Louis V tycoon (Space shit nigga
You ain't never seen theseEmbed
