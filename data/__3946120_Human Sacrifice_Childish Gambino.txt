30 ContributorsHuman Sacrifice Lyrics

Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all?
Two shots and a body, two shots and a body
Two shots and a body involved
Where are those subtle men?
With the decency to might be wrong
Where are those winter girls?
Who corrected, say women
I'm sorry, forgiven


I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness

Secrets, heartbeat
Find you, lovely
Secrets, heartbeat
Find you, lovely

Turn all the lights out
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark
Turn all the lights out
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark

I'm hoping, praying, we are together
No matter the weather
I get lost sometimes
I know in me that we are forever
But never means never
It's so hard to find

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness
I cannot explain the feeling, I'm alone
The loneliness (Oh)
Secrets, heartbeat (To the beat of)
(Your heart) Find you, lovely
(Uh) Secrets, heartbeat (If you know, know)
(Ay, uh) Find you, lovely

Turn all the lights out (Uh)
We shine brighter in the dark (Yeah)
We shine brighter in the dark (Uh)
We shine brighter in the dark
Turn all the lights out (Oooh)
We shine brighter in the dark (Yeah)
We shine brighter in the dark
We shine brighter in the dark

I'm hoping, praying, we are together
No matter the weather
I get lost sometimes
I know in me that we are forever
But never means never
It's so hard to find

Oh, great spirit
Do you hear me? Do you love me?
Will you lift me up?
Oh, great spirit
Do you see me? Do you hear me?
Can you hold me up?
Oh, great spirit
Do you hear me? Do you love me?
Do you lift me up?
Oh, great spirit
Do you love me? Do you hear me?
Can you hear me now?

Can you give me love? Can you send us love?
Cause we need you right now
Yes, we need you, we need your love
We are dying, we are suffering
Oh, we need you right no, oh, we need you spirit
Yes we need you right now, we don't know who we are
We have forgotten all your love, can you please come home?
Please come home
Please come home 
And we need you right now, cause we need you
Can you save us?
Can you save us from ourselves?
Can you save us? Can you save us?
Oh, yes my god, oh, yes my lord
Oh, yes my spirit, oh, yes my spirit
You can hear me, can you help us?
I need, I need you, yes, we need you
We just need you7Embed
