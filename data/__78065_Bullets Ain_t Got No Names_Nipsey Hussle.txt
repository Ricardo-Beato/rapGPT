12 ContributorsBullets Ainâ€™t Got No Names Lyrics
Check, check it out, D-DJ Skee
Power 106, ayy, yo, what's poppin', California?
It's the heavy nigga DJ Felli Fel
I'm co-signing this shit to the fullest
Nipsey is about to be the next shit on the West Coast
Let's go

Why you niggas outside without no gun, you think this shit is a game?
But, no, no, not at all
I'll hop out gunnin', show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
'Cause bullets ain't got no names
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
'Cause bullets ain't got no names
Why you niggas outside without no gun, you think this shit is a game?
But, no, no, not at all
I'll hop out gunnin', show you niggas I ain't playin'
'Cause bullets ain't got no names

Why you niggas act as if your body built to survive the shots?
Knowin' damn well, after I get crackin' you gon' be outlined in chalk
The sun is shining and still it's raining
If you don't wanna get wet, then, boy, stop hanging
My hood is warring, so ain't no warnings
Niggas'll take your life, now your moms is mourning
I done seen it happen when we got crackin'
Six minutes later they got right back at us
Ten minutes later we was right back at them
My burner so hot it put a hole in my mattress
Bullets ain't got no names
You might also like
Why you niggas outside without no gun, you think this shit is a game?
But, no, no, not at all
I'll hop out gunnin', show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
'Cause bullets ain't got no names
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
'Cause bullets ain't got no names

The sun is shining and still it's raining
And you ain't gotta ask where he from, just spray him
By the look up on his face, you could tell he bangin'
See the look up on his face when that thing start ringin'
One down, two to go, suspect usual
Murder scene, the routine ain't new to you
Switch cars, double back, one down, double that
Yellow tape the gate where they niggas at
Some niggas need a bullet 'fore they learn they lesson
You still ain't got your gun, you ain't got the message
My enemies they know, they say he got extras
When I come through I only got one question ("Why you niggas keep hangin' out?")

Why you niggas outside without no gun, you think this shit is a game?
But, no, no, not at all
I'll hop out gunnin', show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
'Cause bullets ain't got no names
Pull the trigger, shoot that nigga
Make sure that you get him
'Cause bullets ain't got no namesEmbed
