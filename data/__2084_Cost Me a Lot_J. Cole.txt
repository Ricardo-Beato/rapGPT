60 ContributorsCost Me a Lot Lyrics
What can I do?
It’s cost me a lot
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
(Shit homie) It’s cost me a lot (Shit homie)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)
It’s cost me a lot (Hey)

Just one of them days, a nigga feel like flossin’
A Stone Cold Stunner, bitch, I'm Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Brees, I’m blowin' a few Gs
Just to hear them hoes say he’s awesome
He’s awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beside me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look, I’m back, bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, 'cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I’m tippin' the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I’d be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I’m living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feel like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar so y’all can see me ballin’, HD
You might also like
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
It’s cost me a lot
My God, watch make momma think someone might rob
It’s cost me a lot
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
It’s cost me a lot
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
It’s cost me a lot

Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that

Knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we takin' off
Don’t wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can’t take it off
'Cause how I’m supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked 'cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice 'cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now that he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh?
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like Deion with the Jheri curl
White Range, call that motherfucker Larry Bird
I got em hangin' on every word
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
It’s cost me a lot
My God, watch make momma think someone might rob
It’s cost me a lot
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
It’s cost me a lot
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
It’s cost me a lot

Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that8Embed
