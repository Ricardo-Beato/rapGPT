5 ContributorsWay We Crazi Lyrics
I'm leavin outside to kill em' all
Me and my bad lil broad
Damn, my offset's tall
This is just the way we crawl
Candy painted cars on chrome
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, money so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

Ralph with the business, trap boy is it
Paint like ,  like church biscuit
Rims like midgets, offset 6s
Cartier lenses, with the thousand dollar britches
Came to the club, me and 3 or 4 bitches
8 or 9 bitches, told shawty, that's senseless
My number's so loaded, the junkies think I'm kidding
Paint so wet, like it can't stop dripping
Rims real big, like Jay-Z lips
When I hit the bar, bring 3 or 4 clips in
3 or 4 chicks in, 10 or 12 henchmen
10 to 12 racks man, Gucci Mane back man

I'm leavin outside to kill em' all
Me and my bad lil broad
Damn, my offset's tall
This is just the way we crawl
Candy painted cars on chrome
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, money so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

I'm just a work dealer, I still play with work
Barney never round me, I still play with Percs
Starburst coloured cars, what I ride in
Lamborghini doors on em', just dive in
King sized sports shorts, filled with bubble cush
And the seats in my car feel like a cushion
Ay, these niggas mad cause I took off
Picked myself up, and brushed that dirty look off
Yeah, I ball hard, and spend a lot of cheese
Young Ralph and Gucci Mane, that's a lot of cheese
Piss yellow diamonds, they'll make you freeze
It's a weather change, bet my neck will make you sneeze

I'm leavin outside to kill em' all
Me and my bad lil broad
Damn, my offset's tall
This is just the way we crawl
Candy painted cars on chrome
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, money so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

Gucci rock the Gucci, Ralph rock the Louis
I can't even lie, the rims get a lot of coochie
Gucci rock the Gucci, Ralph rock the Louis
I can't even lie, the rims get a lot of coochie
Ralph switched up with Gucci, and Gucci switched up with Prada
Haters get ba-da, bitches get na-da
Ralph switched up with Gucci, and Gucci switched up with Prada
Haters get ba-da, bitches get na-da
I'm leavin outside to kill em' all
Me and my bad lil broad
Damn, my offset's tall
This is just the way we crawl
Candy painted cars on chrome
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, money so long
Trap niggas got it goin onEmbed
