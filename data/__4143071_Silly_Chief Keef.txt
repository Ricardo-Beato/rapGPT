9 ContributorsSilly Lyrics
These niggas silly, ayy, ayy
And I'm a bully (I'm a bully, Sos')
He say he want beef and y'all know he shouldn't (Know he shouldn't, ayy)
'Cause bricks can't stop these bullets (Bricks can't stop these bullets, Sos')
My gun the only thing on me pussy (The only thing on me pussy, Sos')
Bust a nigga in a minute (Bust a nigga in a minute, Sos')
It ain't gon' stop shooting 'til I'm finished (It ain't gon' stop shooting 'til I'm finished, Sos')
I was out and now I'm back in it (I was out and now I'm back in it, Sos')

Ayy, ayy, she see my house, now she wanna go in it
That bitch seen my car, now she wanna get in it
Pants cost two thousand but it's seventeen in 'em
And I be ballin' on purpose like motherfuck the refereein'
We got cop Glocks and opp shots
Fuck the cops, we got lullabies
'Nother fuck nigga try to drive-by
We gon' fire his car up
Ayy, smokin' on ganja
On the block with all 300 women
We don't put in the videos, nah, no
Bitch that's free promotions
We ain't promotin' no hoes, no
Bitches gotta suck on the Glo, though
But you already know, though
Who made that thot worse off
You might also like
These niggas silly, ayy, ayy
And I'm a bully (I'm a bully, Sos')
He say he want beef and y'all know he shouldn't (Know he shouldn't, ayy)
'Cause bricks can't stop these bullets (Bricks can't stop these bullets, Sos')
My gun the only thing on me pussy (The only thing on me pussy, Sos')
Bust a nigga in a minute (Bust a nigga in a minute, Sos')
It ain't gon' stop shooting 'til I'm finished (It ain't gon' stop shooting 'til I'm finished, Sos')
I was out and now I'm back in it (I was out and now I'm back in it, Sos')

These niggas silly
Just know this Glo Gang fuckin' somethin' up
I'm off a pilly
Disrespect, I put you under
We got them millys
Fuck niggas know that they ain't on nothin'
You wanna get silly?
Leave you bloody like a town park
I'm off this Cali, got me stupid high
Just spent some racks, got me super fly
Sneak dissin', you can die
We ride with big thirties cocked, you can take two to the eye
Run in the trap, we holdin' them racks
You want it or not? You can decide
You with me, against me, or pushed to the side?
'Cause if you not then I'm gon' push your shit to the side
These niggas silly, ayy, ayy
And I'm a bully (I'm a bully, Sos')
He say he want beef and y'all know he shouldn't (Know he shouldn't, ayy)
'Cause bricks can't stop these bullets (Bricks can't stop these bullets, Sos')
My gun the only thing on me pussy (The only thing on me pussy, Sos')
Bust a nigga in a minute (Bust a nigga in a minute, Sos')
It ain't gon' stop shooting 'til I'm finished (It ain't gon' stop shooting 'til I'm finished, Sos')
I was out and now I'm back in it (I was out and now I'm back in it, Sos')Embed
