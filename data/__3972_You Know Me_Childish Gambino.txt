54 ContributorsYou Know Me Lyrics
(Bitch, you know me)
If you don't like this shit I'm puttin' out, then you can blow me
These dollars in my pocket getting big, I gotta fold it
It's Cheezy in the building, more cheese than macaroni
What the fuck is going on?
I'm in her bush, before I eat, I make her mow the lawn
My career is like award shows, it's going long
I make it look real easy, like I'm showing thong, huh
(Bitch, you know me)
I do a shot, and then I'll sip a Sobe
I'm walking weird 'cause it's Walker that I'm wasted on
People just realizing that I'm awesome, why they take so long?
Skip around the album, it's not hard to find your favorite song
Pussy and these tracks the only things that I go crazy on
Let me slow it down a sec, man, I cannot not be sick
Hook me up with Dimetapp
(Bitch, you know me)
You think you better than I am, then show me
These niggas don't talk that much shit unless you let them
And I let them, 'cause they know if you reply, then you respect them
I've been working for a minute, hope this album's a success
I'm not tryna to do Drake numbers, I'm just tryna do my best
'Cause let's face it, if I wasn't working with Tina on pitches
I would probably flood the market, and go Katrina, you bitches, uh
You might also like
(Bitch, you know me)
I'm sorry mama, but there isn't an old me
That nigga dead, but I promise, he won't die in vain
All I trust is money, fuck these niggas like the Crying Game
This is not a joke. You won't listen to what I'm sayin'
And I promise to destroy any nigga who think I'm playin'
Know my verses can be silly, but I'm choosing not to spray rounds
My verse is pedophiles on the playground, okay now?
(Bitch, you know me)
Half-price flat screens, yes, I work for Sony
I kiss her hard and hit the jet, I make out like a bandit
They trying hard to hate me, I just don't understand it
Screamin' at me, "When you gonna stick to the right business
And stop making rap music for these White kids-es?"
Huh, I make music for these tight kids
Don't be a fucking asshole, one day, you'll have to wipe his
(Bitch, you know me)
I know what I am, and I'll never be hovy
'Cause I am just different, I'm being what I am, man
I don't need a Jesus piece, my jacket cost me 10 grand
I'm going light speed, and I don't care if you can't see us
'Cause I will never stop, like I am cruising in a Prius
You talk from far away because my money's between us
And I'm working hard as hell, until I'm chilling with Aaliyah
Bitch, you know me
