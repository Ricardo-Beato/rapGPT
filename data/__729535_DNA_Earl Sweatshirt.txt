146 ContributorsDNA Lyrics
Intercepting a fifth of whisky and necking it 'til I'm dizzy
I never was defenseless, I never hugged the fence
I pick a side and trust in it, stomach full of drugs and shit
My niggas on some other, Cleanse  Sunday, binge Monday
Then another six days, back to Sunday when it's done again (Shit)
And the pants better be creased on my corpse
If you need that, run until the streetlights off
Back got bigger, got the team strapped on
And you thought it was magic, but that's just the difference
Nigga, my team is magicians
We think of the shit that we want then we get it
Look, I got hoes in my britches
Big-up Dill and Britches, full part coming soon
Thought you knew this, my nigga
It's crackin' like french tips
Just checking and balancing
Checks and the salaries testing my friendships
'Cause niggas get sour of this
Rap shit got the best of me
I threw the rest off the balcony
Shout out Da$H and RetcHy
I know your bitch check for me, so much for chivalry
So long to every bitch tryna get intimate
I'm in my twenties now
Feet aimed at the jaws of the running mouth
Disdain for the law since a fucking child
Spotlights on me, I ain't stopping in my tracks
We taking it all, then we running out
Threw shade in the past, but you love me now, huh?
Put your face in your palm when I come around you
Tell Mama get a gun if I get too popular
I'm just being honest with her
Tell her stop whining, it ain't no more problems
I'm the best out of all these niggas
Watch your tone when you speaking (Yeah)
Ain't no home for the weak
And no rest for your ass if I know that you're sleeping
I'm here and I'm there and I'm up and I'm down
And I'm low and I'm peaking (Yup)
It's cold in the deep end (Yup)
(I'm low and I'm creeping)

Bitch nigga, we the train, if you see 'em wave
Ain't no bitch in my DNA
Bitch nigga, we the train, if you see 'em wave
Ain't no bitch in my DNA
Hundred blunts, niggas change, that's my day to day
Niggas tryna ride my train like they fucking strays
My bro left today, fuck
Hot sauce in my cup of noodles; you taught me that
I ain't seen you in some years
And this news right here almost made me have a heart attack
Your mama heart intact
We just spoke, I couldn't stomach that
I'm going to London on the first
I'm bringing you something back
A house on the hill with a big-ass grill
Where we could have a boxing match
Japan, Australia, I know you'd be proud of that
I got a couple bitches now, I ain't gotta lie 'bout that
I know you in a better place, I can't even cry about that
When I look into the clouds, I know you look down on me
Right next to grandmammy
And the rest of the ones who wanna see me happy68Embed
