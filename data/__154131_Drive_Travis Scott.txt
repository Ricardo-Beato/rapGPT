54 ContributorsDrive Lyrics*Cassette rewinding*

10-201, you know what I'm sayin'?
Smokin' big, drankin' syrup, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
*Cassette rewinding*

What, sucker free, what, what
I can do that (I can do that right there)
I can do that, ay
If I spill drank on my clothes, I can do that
It dont matter 'cause I buy me some more, I can do that
I'ma spend about fifty in the mall, I can do that
I'ma buy me a Bentley in the fall, I can do that
I'ma stop weak niggas from rappin'
*Cassette rewinding*

I, can't, leave, drank alone
It got me feenin' (Feenin', feelin' good)
(Feelin' like a boss as I'm creeping through my hood)
*Car driving and speeding with tires screeching*
You might also like
Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man, I thought the world was ending soon
Damn, the devil stay testin' and the devil wear Prada
(Just tryna go up the avenue)

Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
We rockin' furs, look like I copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on the steez, yeah, I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep that my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mm-hm, that's the shit they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours, I just stared at the stars
And looked with my eyes closed 'cause it's driving me wild

Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive, oh, yeah

Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

Junior!
Fuck!
Junior, turn that shit off!
Man, for what? Nigga, shut up!
What'd I tell you about playin' that loud-ass music in this fuckin' house?
Fuck! Fuckin' drums crazy!21Embed
