6 ContributorsPandemonium Lyrics{*scratched: "pandemonium"*}

(See now) Catch a vision (a'ight) view me in the eyes of unequal
High above the plains but still remains equal
Livin on, no matter how fly there is no sequel
I am not a supreme being, freeing people
'Cause many minds are zombified, that's why they never rest
Fightin for the light and fightin' holes in their chest
Merely scavengers but no one who'll confess
But in time, they will all undress
Livin in the lost & found, trapped without sound
Dappin' ass a pound means it's way underground
No, calculating 'cause it's all round
Round like a figure, in old school calligra-phy
So figure that you don't wanna see
Far greater than the eye so you can fly Cali
Used to have a tax on teens now they got a tax on me
But that's if you can find me
I'll be trippin with the scene with the pan-de..monium
{*scratched: "pandemonium"*}

He been 'causin more calamities to me than Am-ity
-ville Horror, real horror, way mo' wicked than Gomorrah
Or Sodom, I shoulda shot him but I didn't
Right then, to me my man hit it
Just because I'm tenant reason why they hit me with a rotten label
And use trickery to put my cards upon the table
So they can COPY, but they're UNABLE~!
They come SLOPPY, ill equipped to grip the sacred cables
Stretchin' out, that age old fable
How they're not really my friends
They can't wait to infiltrate and get me for my ends
It's been trend-in, in everything I do
The devil tries to throw his wicked wrench into with his henchmen crew
Main reason why I, resist whack guys
And let 'em know they couldn't wrap with me aluminum
(When you what?) When I'm causin' pandemonium...

Somebody tell me what's wrong with this picture
(What?) How long will it take before it hits ya?
And you begin to understand
The dirty underhanded plan to place pandemonium upon the land
Face to face with the faces of death
On a daily basis, to the point we embrace this
(What?) Demonic debauchery
Negatively affecting the psyche, that's why we like to see
Some type of monster chasin'
Erasin' people from the face of the Earth like Jason
When that was just a movie merely illustrating
The illy type of shit that they really got waitin'
And I can't be condonin' 'em (Why is that?)
Sick minds perpetuatin' pandemonium
{*scratched: "pandemonium"*}

Mere men are two handicapped to adapt
On my terrain, they remain in the same frame of thought
And they only thought as I laughed
At they foolish attempt to pin my technique
So I set a new mark, transforming my styles
To reconcile with the present, peasant
Meaning unsliced conditions
Like the ninjas on my trail, you will fail in hell
The young male will prevail when all hell breaks
I hate fakes, worse I hate flakes~!
Men get worse I get 'em to make their mistakes
I stay low like a sheet of linoleum
When it comes to pandemonium
