4 ContributorsSleeping On The Bright Side Lyrics
The snow's deep I can't wait for the spring
I go to sleep to try to change up the scene
I'm overeating, still running on steam
I know I'm drinking just to numb the dream
I'm sitting in the courtyard lit like the north star
I'm trying to figure out where yours are
The bonfire kept your hair out my face
While we was staring up at space asking Jesus for a raise
But of course now you're gone
You've got me looking forward, towards a new dawn
I got a look up more words to forge a few songs
So I can cook some d'orderves for my boys and they mom
But the chase stays driving me craze
And I'm supposed to embrace it like, "Thanks"
And I shouldn't waste time complaining
'Cuz I'm alive and I'm inside from out of the raining
It goes

And we could try to make up for lost time
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side
And we could both read a different chapter
As long as I can see you in the after
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side
You might also like
I know I'm wrong, but sometimes
I know I'm right as well
Might as well let you know, right now I'm as right as the time
I'm the opposite of left, all the opposition left
It's just a song, but sometimes
It's just a song that helps
Might as well make a sketch
Write it down, used to write all the time
I see you from the other side of the shine

And we could try to make up for lost time
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side
And we could both read a different chapter
As long as i can see you in the after
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side

Do you remember when I slowed it down?
I was trying to make it last like the letter zed
And I'll admit that in the back of my severed head
I'm asking if she'd rather be sleeping up in a seperate bed
She's the magnifying glass between the sun and the fuse
She matched every single hue of blue
She was eleven eleven, I was a catch 22
Make a wish, but wait until i'm sleeping next to you, huh
And I can go my whole life without another love
But can't go a full night without fucking up
Are you serious?
The sky fell, I'm still walking on shells trying to protect myself
And each time that lightning strikes
You said I look so lifelike
But that's like it looks like
Somebody brought some sunshine to a gun fight
Come find me on the bright side
And we could try to make up for lost time
As long as you can meet me at the stop sign
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side
And we could both read a different chapter
As long as I can see you in the after
No matter where you wake up tonight
I hope you're sleeping on the bright side

It's the middle 2 of a four bar, watch
Skip the first bar
Hit the second bar
Grab the third bar
Move off of the fourth
Skip the first bar
Hit the second bar
And the third bar
Lose on the four
Lose on the four
Come on
I skip the first bar
Grab the second bar
Hit the third bar
Now I'm fuckin' drunk
Flip the first bar
Grab the second bar
Hit the third bar
Lose it on the four
Lose it on the four
