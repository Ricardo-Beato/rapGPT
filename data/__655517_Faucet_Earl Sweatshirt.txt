Chef Sweaty braising your faculty (Yuh)
Face getting gray from the ash, but I'm laughing (Yuh)
That's the trace in me, nigga
Fuck out my face while I'm thinking
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute
My days numbered (Yeah)
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em
Feel like I'm the only one pressing to grow upwards
Still, "Fuck you and whoever you showed up with"
Tryna see an end and some steadier hands (Yup)
Who you calling your mans? (Huh)
Bet you thought he was solid
When he really just sand, washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August, in the wake of that August
Last autumn, the leaves fell, and I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribed faith, never called 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in the faucet (Yeah)

And I don't know who house to call home lately
(I hope my phone break, let it ring)
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
(I hope my phone break, let it ring)
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
You might also like
Solid, so the funds don't phase me (Yup)
On tour, wildin' 'bout a truck-stop racist (Ugh)
Hard as finding me a— a common thread between us
Raised different—my mama, she bore and bred the leader
Get shit popping like the gun's off safety (Yup)
Saying easy and doing harder when you get caught up
Raised neck-and-neck with Nak, so I’m a fluent brawler
Rain-checking on your plot if ever bread should pop up
Out the toaster, I gotta focus, my family problems
Shrunk and widened with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt 'cause I can’t keep a date or put personal time in
Or reverse to the times when my face didn’t surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile, never change, I’m stupid for trying
Still just too busy wilding (Still, yeah)

And I don't know who house to call home lately
(I hope my phone break, let it ring)
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
(I hope my phone break, let it ring)
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me83Embed
