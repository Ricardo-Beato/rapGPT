8 ContributorsLots of Cash Lyrics
I gets lots of cash 
If you don't like it kiss my ass

I got lots of bags, I got lots of cash
I got lots of swag girl, I'm all about a sack
I jus got a pack that stupid crazy thrax
I might smoke this whole pound
I might not sell a sack, I'm all about the racks
I'm default in this kush cloud baby hold that blunt down
Don't let them see what's lick a million dollars spent I'm gilla Gucci iced down I'm in my trap house
Right now I'm tryna make it back
Them east atlanta cats they don't know how to act
We all about that cash so we all about the tax
We'll give yo ass a cigarette to charge you for the match
Dished out on the power plus we make up with the crack
I got cash at my house so I wake up with my gat
I'm sleeping with my chopper cause living with the sack
Let's say we the future and you bring Gucci a check
Don't be surprised I tear the check and slap you with a stack Gucci

I gets lots of cash 
If you don't like it kiss my ass

And my cash engaged we so amazed
Never be without the cash I keep it in the back
Even when I go to bed my cash in my lap
