5 ContributorsI Choose You Lyrics
Alright, I'ma just like do it
Ayy

Chilling with the family, watch my baby grow
Gave up on all this rap shit to watch my baby grow
But I gotta come back every now and then just to let y'all know
I need to rest I know, but I just can't rest this flow
It's such a restless flow, this life is precious, yo
Been enjoying my sunshine as far as days go
I ain't here to profiteer, hold up, step back, let me get this clear
I ain't making a dollar off of this mixtape here
I'm tryna rap top tier and drop ideas
Free music ain't had me this inspired in years 'cause
Dropping free music, it comes with many fears
I mean without a streaming service it's hard to catch any ears, but
I'm finally seeing plenty clear
I'd rather have the time of my life sampling anything I want and not make a single penny here
Yeah, I'm retired, record label fired, I'm hella admired
But this whole goddamn industry is fucking expired
"Logic, I thought you wasn't doing albums, you're a liar"
Shut the fuck up, this is a free mixtape
Your momma having your ass was a god damn mistake
I've never felt this great
At this rate, I might just tour off a whole fuckin' mixtape
Inglorious Basterd, I do a world tour plastered
Then drop volume two without it being mixed and mastered
I wrote this whole tape in a weekend, no upshift
Logic here to uplift, can't clone the cloth I'm cut with
This that Datpiff, 2 Dope Boyz rap shit
2011, this song is sick, let's slap this
And when it comes to rap I'm Tyson meets Cassius
'Til you see me in person and feel like you got catfished
But don't judge a book by its cover
You know that white boy a brother
You know that, you know that, ayo
You might also like
Ayy this the mixtape for the streets, I wrote this shit in graffiti
Food for thought for the needy, never the greedy
This my generation, I might just put this whole fuckin' shit out on CD
Chilling with my family watching TV
Sheneneh, she back at it
First memories of watching Martin way back when my daddy was a crack addict
Made a decision to put him out my life, I done had it
But I think about him everyday
Wish we could have a relationship but it ain't no way
'Cause every time I set boundaries, shit, he wanna rip 'em away
I learned a lot from my dad, like all the shit you shouldn't do
But now that I got my boy, there ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To be there for him, care for him and share for him
Day he was born shit on the day I sold out the Forum
I wish he could meet his grandaddy, I'm so torn
And well, I guess we all got family problems but
My life's good, my wife's good, I made it out the hood
And I'm always giving back like I should
I made it, now they know me
Acting like you owe me, fuck you, blow me
I help those who don't ask me for shit only
'Cause when I needed a hand, you wasn't my man
Now they call me like "Ayy bruh, remember way back when?"
I don't mean to condescend, but man, don't fucking pretend
You wasn't with me when I was losing, don't celebrate when I winEmbed
