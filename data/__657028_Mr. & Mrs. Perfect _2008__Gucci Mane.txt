7 ContributorsMr. & Mrs. Perfect (2008) Lyrics
She bad
She straight
She fine as hell
What's up? What's up?
What's up with you, lil' bro?
I got them bags (Ooh, Mr. Perfect)

Ms. Perfect, she right, Mr. Perfect, not Mr. Right
Ms. Perfect, damn, she fly, Mr. Perfect hurt ya wife
Whip with the matching ice, watch out 'cause I take it down
'Cause she lookin' perfect, and I'm Mr. Perfect
Yo' girl perfect, I'm Mr. Perfect
Yo' girl flirtin' cause my chain perfect
Watch ring perfect, earring perfect
She's Ms. Perfect, and I am Mr. Perfect

Perfect, she thick and she curvy
Ms. Perfect, she fine and she purty
Booty real big but her waist lil' bitty
Zay, let me talk to these girls for a minute
Gucci Mane, La Flare, I do not have a Bentley
But, baby girl, I am richer than Richie
VVS chain on just like 50
All white diamond watch just like Diddy
Three or four charms on, just like Busta
What's up, 30? No, it ain't Nelly
Ice game killed you, wrist game meltin'
Yo' girl perfect, that's a good question (Question)
Sideline cuts me, I'm not stressin'
I'm not stressin' 'cause I'm so wealthy (So wealthy)
Sideline cuts me, I'm not stressin'
I'm not stressin' 'cause I'm so wealthy

Ms. Perfect, she right, Mr. Perfect, not Mr. Right
Ms. Perfect, damn, she fly, Mr. Perfect hurt ya wife
Whip with the matching ice, watch out 'cause I take it down
'Cause she lookin' perfect, and I'm Mr. Perfect
Yo' girl perfect, I'm Mr. Perfect
Yo' girl flirtin' cause my chain perfect
Watch ring perfect, earring perfect
She's Ms. Perfect and I am Mr. Perfect

Me and my right wrist perfect, right wrist perfect
Four big chains on so my neck hurtin'
Corvette perfect, Dually truck perfect
Management perfect, so I stay workin'
Big networkin', damn, we thirsty
Need some big thick girls booty look perfect
2,500, no they don't deserve it (No)
How they don't deserve it? Titties lookin' perfect
Booty look perfect, face look perfect
No she's not a virgin but she can be girlfriend
Took her to the mansion, yeah, we bangin'
She been chillin' in the mansion for three or foyr days

Ms. Perfect, she right, Mr. Perfect, not Mr. Right
Ms. Perfect, damn, she fly, Mr. Perfect hurt ya wife
Whip with the matching ice, watch out 'cause I take it down
'Cause she lookin' perfect, and I'm Mr. Perfect
Yo' girl perfect, I'm Mr. Perfect
Yo' girl flirting 'cause my chain perfect
Watch ring perfect, earring perfect
She's Ms. Perfect, and I am Mr. Perfect
Gucci Mane, La Flare, you can call me Wilt Chamberlain
EA Sports 'cause its all in the game, man
Jumped out early, start weed slangin'
Progressed up to cocaine and gang bangin'
Damn, yo' baby girl in love with a banger
Twistin' up his fingers 'cause  love sells
Mrs. Perfect, you fucked up but you paid her
I paid her, but I'd probably pay more
Whip need 4 horse, 2 jays, 2 doors
Two seats, two Glock, jammin' a-Embed
