Yeah, well, you could be my...
Said you could be my...
Yeah, you could be my...
Yeah, okay, well, you could be my...
Baby, you could be my...
Said, baby, you could be my...
Yeah, uh, well, okay, it's alright, it's okay

Okay, well, you could be my... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
You could be my... (Boo)
Yeah, well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you could be my... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you could be my... (Boo)

Well, you ain't in the mood to argue
Baby, don't you worry, this some shit to get along to
Some shit I right my wrongs to
Well, I've tried to call you, have us a discussion
We never talk, we always way too busy fuckin'
I'll think of somethin' to say, I always do
I'm in love with the way that you say my name
Every time it sound brand new
You might also like
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me

Baby, you could be my... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, I feel like you could be my... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my... (Boo)
It's alright, it's okay

Yeah, okay
And time will tell if I'm alive and well, 'cause when I'm by myself
I find that I keep flyin' high, sometimes I must remind myself
That change is more than pennies layin' on the floor inside the well
You cross my mind, do not apologize for bein' fine as hell
I'm spinnin' here inside your spell
My mind, it start to wander
Miss a day, I stay up late admirin' your posture

And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me
Baby, you could be my... (Boo)
Yeah, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And, baby, you could be my... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your... (Boo)
Okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, only if you be my... (Boo)

There's no more you or me, we are we, yes we are
(Yes we are, sweet baby)
And I can see, I can see, so much better (I can see)
And carefully, precious things fall apart
Just let them be, let it be, forever, oh
Lovin' me, in spite of me, bless your heart (Bless your heart)
I can breathe, I can breathe, so much better (Yeah)
I won't let anything tear us apart, no, no, no
We are we, we are we, forever

You could be my... (Boo)
Okay, it's alright, it's okay
I feel like you could be my... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my... (Boo)
It's alright, it's okay
You gotta deal with Mac Miller, bitch
