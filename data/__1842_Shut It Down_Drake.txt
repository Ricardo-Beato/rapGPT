Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you

Uh, say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star, you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Tryna take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to, put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

Shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you, Ki-Killa, Killa

Uh, girl you the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You the finest (Oh-whoa)
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shutting it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in them Louboutins
What you want, what you need (Yeah)
I can be (Yeah) your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

And together, we shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice (They'd know)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
Every time we come around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
(And they're on it) And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice
They'd know you shut it down
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations, they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets (Yes indeed)
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she look like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until ya find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she ain't got my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl, who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

You shut that thing down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
Down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
You shut it, oh, oh
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down, down...


The way I’m feeling, things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way, oh
What can I do, to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl, I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not tryna say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it, girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

Lay you down, down, down
I’m tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it48Embed
