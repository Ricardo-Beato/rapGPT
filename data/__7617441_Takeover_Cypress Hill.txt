4 ContributorsTakeover Lyrics
You know, what we do we do because we have to do

Cypress block, we plotted the takeover
This is the return of the Hill, the wait's over
Since day one, we represented for them corners
This is the return of the Hill, the wait's over
The street life has turned my niggas to some soldiers
Frontline riders that will die for the culture
So if you're with me, let hear you count it down
It goes five, four, three, two

Raised in a place no one thought was safe
Police made sure that no one could get away
From night to day, I've been wild since a juvenile
Got that reckless snatch your necklace type of move around
And you could smell the loud cruisin' down the street
In my trunk I got the pounds movin' 'round to the beat
Guns by the feet for any contenders
Long barrel, short tempers, there's no surrender
See, I was raised with that SoCal vocal
Where you could choked out at your neighborhood smoke-out
Always roll 'round with homies that you hold down
And we all rep L.A. 'cause that's our hometown
But now it's on, see the stages we control now
Go get your tickets, we wreckin' shit up in your town
Shots go off, turn this shit into a ghost town
And catch a contact high as it goes 'round
You might also like
Cypress block, we plotted the takeover
This is the return of the Hill, the wait's over
Since day one, we represented for them corners
This is the return of the Hill, the wait's over
The street life has turned my niggas to some soldiers
Frontline riders that will die for the culture
So if you're with me, let hear you count it down
It goes five, four, three, two

Since day one, I repped for legalization
Showed the nation how to roll a blunt, put it in the rotation
So don't you go and get played like PlayStations
I'm higher than Space Stations, our minds in different places
Let my dogs out the cages, armed and dangerous
Home of gang affiliations and altercations
You came to L.A. on a family vacation
And they pulled up on you with that 12-gauge ultimatum
Like "Give it up, all that shit, yeah, give it up"
They call me Dr. Greenthumb because I got the Midas touch
Roll it and light it up, they call us the higher-ups
Masters of the stage, hit the crowd and divide 'em up
I grab the left and you go grab the right
They got a need for destruction shit, so let's just feed their appetite
The shots'll send a hater to his afterlife
And this kush'll send your head up to the satellites
Cypress block, we plotted the takeover
This is the return of the Hill, the wait's over
Since day one, we represented for them corners
This is the return of the Hill, the wait's over
The street life has turned my niggas to some soldiers
Frontline riders that will die for the culture
So if you're with me, let hear you count it down
It goes five, four, three, twoEmbed
