7 ContributorsIâ€™m Dat Bitch Lyrics
Where my real bitches at?
Only Queen Bee can bring the real niggas back
If I could I'd get the keys to the jail and free Bobby
We need the real niggas back (Hold ya head, Shmurda!)
Your MCM is my TBT
You might catch me on the jet with TBE
We all eating no EBT, Prime 112 then LIV
Everything LIT, we bout to make a movie
And sell this shit to NBC
Chanel nail polish, lingerie, yeah, it's all designer
He eat the pussy on the spot like Benihana
Every freaking night and every freaking day
I want to fucking get paid in every freaking way
One, zero, zero, zero, bitch, then a comma
Zero, zero, zero, bitch, then a comma
Zero, zero, zero, bitch, then a comma
Get the cash out the teller, bitch, then too Donna
Baby, you the man of it all
Spending them bands on it all
Ain't gonna get you far
'Cause I'm that bitch

I'm that bitch
I'm that bitch
I'm that bitch
I'm that bitch
You might also like
I keep it a stack like a G
Nobody do it like the Queen Bee
That's why they all wanna be me
'Cause I'm that bitch

I'm that bitch
I'm that bitch
I'm that bitch
I'm that bitch1Embed
