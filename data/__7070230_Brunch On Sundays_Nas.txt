Mm, mm, uh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, yeah

Bottomless bellinis, afternoon sun
Girls twerkin' on the tables they just havin' fun
Leave them girls alone
You the owner, what you on?
Buckets of Dom P, how many you want?
My nigga, he brought his son, got his dad's face
We order crabcakes, table with mad plates
R&B playlist, I'm in Blxst space (Cheers)
She told me 'bout her last date, I had to laugh in her face, yo

That's brunch on Sundays
Bring the hookah to the table she gon' smoke until her lungs ache
That's brunch on Sundays
Postin’ pictures on the 'Gram hashtaggin', "Sunday fun day"

Go in Chocolate City, D.C. girls saditty
Valet park the Wraith, here's a hundred fifty
Fitted match the linen, linen match the tennis
Net worth match the image
Shorty was a AKA, best friend was a Delta
Bringin' up her student loans, I told her that I felt her
Flyest women on the yard, now they work for Delta
New Chanel slides, slip 'em off like Cinderella
You might also like
That's brunch on Sundays
Mad blunts, real runts girls, tryin' to act up
Gotta keep it classy, this ain't time to act tough
Eye to eye when we toast, we don't need no bad luck
That's brunch on Sundays (Cheers)
Bring the hookah to the table she gon' smoke until her lungs ache (Cheers)
That's brunch on Sundays
Postin' pictures on the 'Gram hashtaggin', "Sunday fun day"

It's my favorite day of the week (Oh)
It's my favorite day (Oh)
It's my favorite day of the week (Yeah, yeah)
To make it Sunday to Sunday, that shit is deep

Keep it playa at all times
Be patient, it's all vibes
You fuckin' with the latest and greatest of our time
They know if I'm winnin', we winnin', we all shine
Make sure my people got a plate at the table before mine

That's brunch on Sundays, this one's different
It's the good guy mixed with American Pimp shit
I got Birkin money but the Telfar carry different
That's a black business, I handle my Black business
Stay out of Black woman business 'less you invested in it
Told her check her Zelle account, there's a blessin' in it
That's brunch on Sundays, she belong on a runway
White Celine visor to block the sunrays
Oysters work as an afrodisiac (Yeah)
Soulful Sundays, run Anita back (Rapture)
Gave her sweet love she said she needed that
Still a playa baby, I know you seen The Mack
That's brunch on Sundays
Mad blunts, real runts, girls tryin' to act up
Gotta keep it classy, this ain't time to act tough (Classy)
Eye to eye when we toast, we don't need no bad luck (Bless up)
That's brunch on Sundays (Cheers)
Bring the hookah to the table she gon' smoke until her lungs ache (Cheers)
That's brunch on Sundays
Postin' pictures on the 'Gram hashtaggin', "Sunday fun day"

It's my favorite day of the week (Oh, let’s break bread)
It’s my favorite day (Oh)
It's my favorite day of the week (Yeah, yeah)
To make it Sunday to Sunday, that shit is deep (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's brunch on Sunday, oh
Break bread with the people, yeah2Embed
