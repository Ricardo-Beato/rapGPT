15 ContributorsForeign Lyrics
Ayy
Never drove nothing with a plastic plate
Eating good every day, shrimp and steak
Balling hard like the La'
Add the -kers
Your ho, we dive in her
Foreign, foreign
All of my bitches foreign, foreign
All of my partners foreign, foreign
All of they bitches foreign, foreign

Okay, Young Thug is here, what was y'all saying?
Might sign for 1.5, no thinkin'
Fifteen hoes got the spot get to bangin'
But I made them hoes leave the bando cause they was standing
I'm dead fresh, your shoes are brown, Nino
Made her mine and turned her to a Subzero
I need some Xan, blunt chairs, Jingo
Even ask him 'bout the flow, baby he know
You can even ask your ho about it
Uh, matter fact, don't ask no ho about it
Uh, and we in this bitch
And if a nigga play, we gon' end this bitch, yeah
You might also like
Ayy
Never drove nothing with a plastic plate
Eating good every day, shrimp and steak
Balling hard like the La'
Add the -kers
Your ho, we dive in her
Foreign, foreign
All of my bitches foreign, foreign
All of my partners foreign, foreign
All of they bitches foreign, foreign

Foreign bitches and loot, all the things that I live for
Paid for all of them coupes, what the fuck you think we was here for?
A gift for three hoes on the speed boat, flip mode
And I got molly with me, you need to chill, ho
I got some homeboys rocking Louie V, and they still broke
I know some big dogs that got big cake cause they deal coke
And I'm a young cat, I got big cake and it's still grow
What the mil' 'for? I'm updating my wheels, ho
And my bitches stay foreign just take a look
And my plugs stay foreign, relationships
And I'm like "Thugga, what it do my nigga?"
Hold up, I can be them niggas
Ayy
Never drove nothing with a plastic plate
Eating good every day, shrimp and steak
Balling hard like the La'
Add the -kers
Your ho, we dive in her
Foreign, foreign
All of my bitches foreign, foreign
All of my partners foreign, foreign
All of they bitches foreign, foreign

Givin' out free bags just like FEMA
Old ho look like Trina
Plus my new ho look like Tina
Ay Thugga, yo red hot heaters
Say my words with no subpoena
Had 
My whip renamed Baeena
New ho, she loves Katrina
All iced 
Y'all call it that camp, but in my hood, we say 
Yeah that 
I'm Migos for them kilos and I break it down for my people
And they putting on and I'm putting on, we all bosses we equals
My new whip (Foreign, foreign)
We running them big  (Four arms, four arms)
 we overseas (Tourin', tourin')
And my bank account (Bonjour, bonjour)
Ayy
Never drove nothing with a plastic plate
Eating good every day, shrimp and steak
Balling hard like the La'
Add the -kers
Your ho, we dive in her
Foreign, Foreign
All of my bitches foreign, foreign
All of my partners foreign, foreign
All of they bitches foreign, foreign5Embed
