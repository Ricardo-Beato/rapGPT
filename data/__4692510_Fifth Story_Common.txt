13 ContributorsFifth Story Lyrics

They dated three years before they got married
Lived next door to my homeboy Merry
Right in South Shore where the bodies get buried
Her family Jamaican, she nice with the curry
Like Steph, she step back and splash spices
Kit Kats and cakes was her vices
Vanilla icing with the strawberry
She was lactose so she rarely ate dairy
Her husband named Terry, knew where to get the good cake
Vegan, black-owned for the hood's sake
Today was one of them days, she couldn’t wait
And she got off work a lil' late
Shortcake, after a long day, the smell of perfume in the hallway
Terry open the door like, "What up, bae?"
Nigga actin' like it’s just another day
She dropped her bags, quickly kissed him
She was on a mission, went straight to the kitchen
Looked at the cake and noticed it was different
Thinkin' to herself, "Why this nigga get this one?"
Opened the box there was two pieces missin'
Is it just suspicion or a woman's intuition?
Terry moved positions to give her a hug
Right then, she noticed lipstick on the mug
You might also like
Damn, this muhfuh-
Supposed to be the nigga that loved ya
If he did this, that's fucked up
You know we gon' lie like Russia
Now I gotta spy, asked a few things and he did reply
Tryna see truth lookin' deep in his eye
I'ma need proof or he gon’ deny
Pissed thinkin’ 'bout a bitch feedin’ this guy

It's crazy, I was thinkin' you were my baby
Wasn't looking both ways, you played me
Now you running away from blamin’, so crazy
You gon' make me wanna go and get real again
You gon' make me have to go and get real again
You were driving me crazy and now I'm feelin' it
So don't speak I don't wanna hear your synonyms

She like, "Damn, damn" like Kendrick from Compton
Wonderin' if her man on some Tristan Thompson
Is it reality or in her conscious?
That's wild if they did it in they apartment
The nerve of this nigga
She gon' have to swerve on this nigga
Put the clothes on the curb of this nigga
He even changed the shirt, 'cause this nigga
Must be into something
Whole house clean, could tell he was frontin'
She went to the back, the trash, he had dumped 'em
The bedroom, the bathroom, trash, he had dumped 'em
Usually 'round the crib he don't ever do nothin'
Huntin' and sniffin' around for what's relevant
Might get to sniffin' his nuts like a elephant
Some niggas is anti-intelligent
That bullshit, he kept on selling it
Like a traphouse
His story was the neighbor got locked out and had to come over
Birth of a salesman, he almost sold her
'Til she saw strands of blue hair on the shoulder
Sittin', cussin' on the couch at her spot
Saw "Love & Hip Hop" was recently watched
Something that he wouldn't watch
She thinkin', "Terry, you shoulda kept ya dick in a box"
Damn, this muhfuh-
Supposed to be the nigga that loved ya
If he did this, that's fucked up
You know we gon' lie like Russia
Now I gotta spy, asked a few things and he did reply
Tryna see truth lookin' deep in his eye
I'ma need proof or he gon' deny
Pissed thinkin' 'bout a bitch feedin' this guy

It's crazy, I was thinkin' you were my baby
Wasn't looking both ways, you played me
Now you running away from blamin', so crazy
You gon' make me wanna go and get real again
You gon' make me have to go and get real again
You were driving me crazy and now I'm feelin' it
So don't speak I don't wanna hear your synonyms

When she stressed out, she start eatin'
Went to the kitchen for that cake she was tweakin'
He gave reasons, now she believin'
He care too much to be out here cheatin'
Like she freezin', his arms wrapped around her
From wild wild, to a calm that's around her
Terry thinkin' he gon' put her on that counter
She like quiet, he gon' make her get louder
She found a knife for the cake to start cuttin'
Terry said "Stop", all of a sudden
"Baby, I must've been on one
This got dairy in it, I got the wrong one"
The phone rung, it was the bakery he got the cake from
To make her feel good, he put it on speaker
So she wouldn't be insecure like Issa
The clerk said, "Mr. Terry, yo, you left your VISA
And it was really real good to meet your wife
Her blue hair was fresh, her perfume was nice"
Things got ice, ice
He about to feel that spice, spice
She remember goin' up flights smellin' perfume
And seein' blue hair in the bathroom
As Terry mumbled, tellin' his story
She pushed him out the window of the fifth story
