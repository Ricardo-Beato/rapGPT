Ooh, ooh
Woah, yeah
Ooh (Yeah)

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fuckin' sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin' straight from Poland

Why? 'Cause they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew, woah

Yeah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, "Your lyrics do shit for me"
I told my story and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Woah
'Cause we blowin' like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
