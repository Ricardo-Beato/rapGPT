30 ContributorsOh My Goodness Lyrics
()
I got racks up in my pocket, racks up in my pocket (Ayy)
I got thots all in my phone calling me, bitch stop it (Bang, bang, bang)
(ISO)
Fourteen hundred for this belt, this ain’t no damn Versace (Skrrt, skrrt)
(Oh wee, it's Oh!Zone on the beat)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Foe'nem just got them racks, got them sacks, them stacks
Them rolls, them hoes, them clothes
Glo Gang
Know how we rocking like cut-off stockings, keep kush in our pockets
Bang

I got racks up in my pocket, racks up in my pocket
I got thots all in my phone calling me, bitch, stop it
Fourteen hunned for this belt, this ain’t no damn Versace
And I’m smoking on this dope, my hobby getting money
I count money like a pro, you know that I done done it
Twenties, fifties, hundreds, bitch, I’m stunting
Fifties, hundreds, twenties, oh my goodness
I need my money machine to count this lil' shit for me

I be flexin' on niggas, just coolin' (Flexin', flexin')
I got my niggas, my money, my toolie (Need my money and my toolie)
I got my cars, my house and my jewelry (Yes, man)
Flexin' on niggas, I ain't worried (I ain't worried 'bout a thing)
Smoking Tooka to the head (Tooka to the head)
Come through shoot ya then ya dead (Come through shoot ya then ya dead)
I’m getting money, fuck the feds (I’m getting money, fuck the feds)
And I’m Glo Gang, what is this? (And I’m Glo Gang, what is this?)
That’s my shit, you lil' bitch (That’s my shit, you lil' bitch)
Let’s get rich, you lil' bitch (Let’s get rich, you lil' bitch)
Get off my dick, you lil' bitch (Get off my dick, you lil' bitch)
And go get you a brick (And go get you a brick)
Smoking TuTu, this my oxygen (Smoking TuTu)
Too much damn TuTu, where my car keys, man? (Too much damn TuTu)
Counting rolls like a boxer, man (Counting rolls)
Ya know that I'm the man (Ya know it)
