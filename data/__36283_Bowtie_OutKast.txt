Girl, you cut up (Lucius Left Foot, hahaha, ow)
Girl, you know you cut up (You see me in my bowtie, don't ya?)

Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah

Nasty Noompsy Knightingale, fresh in that tuxedo
Cummerbund with no suspenders, my torpedo, you libido
Need to chat (Chip-chop it up, shoot the breeze)
I'm your R-O-L-A-I-D-S, release the squeeze
Or release the keys to the shackles on her wrist
She can tackle some of this, smack on, smack on some of this
Dick Tracy, arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body's full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
Whatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze)
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene, wearing
You might also like
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac

Oh (Oh), Lord (Lord), how can it be so hard?
To put on a pair of panties, much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get the cat
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that?
On your back like a cheerleader missing the final stack
As we strut, skip the line
Through the glass window, glance, we look fine
Right on time as we step in the place
The nursery's crunk, we've come to play
Everybody's watching 'cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling, oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me, throw your hands up if you feel me
'Cause we well designed (Bowtie), like the finest wines (Bowtie)
Feel good to be fly (Bowtie), so don't you ask me why (Bowtie)
I got the ladies in line (Bowtie), because they can't deny (Bowtie)
So raise your hands to the sky (Bowtie), 'cause we super fly, 'cause we super fly (Bowtie)

Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac

I mind my own business
Don't jive with me, don't jive with me
I mind my own business
Don't jive with me, jive with me, sucka
I mind my own business
Don't jive with me, don't jive with me
I mind my own business
Don't jive with me, jive with me, sucka4Embed
