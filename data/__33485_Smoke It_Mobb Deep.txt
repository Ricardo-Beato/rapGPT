7 ContributorsSmoke It Lyrics
Go get your ratchet, my homie, we not havin that
Get 'em in the club when that shit jam packed
Keep thinkin it's a game, get your man tooks
I'm never under pressure, never seen Hav' shook
Blood Money album drop, hell broke loose
All the drama, ain't no tellin who I'm gonna shoot
Check my motherfuckin' resume
Catch Hav where the motherfuckin cheddar be
Slide through with your own risk
Chain gat, run a train with your lil bitch
Tears drop cause death is a tear jerker
Whether shot or strapped up to a steel gurner
It's foul how they took out Tookie
All this foul shit I did they should have took me
Smokey, smoke a mmmmm thats a slow toke
Liquor for the homies, gonna small toast

I'm holdin, cock back nigga move slow
The moment, squeeze the trigga of the fo-fo
You notice, niggas snitchin for them po-pos
I'm frozen, neck, wrist, fingers no joke
I'm holdin, cock back nigga move slow
The moment, squeeze the trigga of the fo-fo
You notice, niggas snitchin for them po-pos
I'm frozen, neck, wrist, fingers no...

I smoke that nigga like a purple stick
Smoke a bitch pussy till she walk with a limp, ha
L-M-N-O P, heavy metal things
When my 2007 guns is plastic
For you crackheads, the new crack is Mobb Deep
Put the pipe down pick up the CD
In a hood near you, we got all the things
They sell they couch, and they TV's
Just so they can get a few tokes of the dope
New shit from Hav and shit P wrote
Yo they passin new laws, so they can ban us
Cause our shit is so strong niggas jaws be stuck
(Twisted, twisted) and they throwin up
They nauseous because it's the Porsches we clutch
It's a love-hate thing, we got that these fiends, thun
They hate when we gone, and love when we re-up

I'm holdin, cock back nigga move slow
The moment, squeeze the trigga of the fo-fo
You notice, niggas snitchin for them po-pos
I'm frozen, neck, wrist, fingers no joke
I'm holdin, cock back nigga move slow
The moment, squeeze the trigga of the fo-fo
You notice, niggas snitchin for them po-pos
I'm frozen, neck, wrist, fingers no...1Embed
