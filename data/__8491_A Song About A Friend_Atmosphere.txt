Girl: "What?"
Slug: "I didn't say nothin'.'"
Girl: "Yes you did."
Slug: "No I didn't."
Girl: "No you didn't say anything, you just looked at me funny like I'm some sort of fucking freak."
Slug: "I didn't look at you."
Girl: "Yeah, you looked at me."
Slug: "No."
Girl: "Yeah, you fucking did."
Slug: "What do you mean, freak?"
Who's this one about? Who's this one about?...

These headphones keep me from rememberin' (rememberin')
Also guilty of letting me not forget (also guilty)
What type of harvest will September bring? (beckoning)
Everyone to put him to that test (Somebody please kill me)
I've got a sickness, it feels like love
It's not contagious, take off the gloves
Drop your defenses, apply a coat of perfect
I'll form the sentences you try to interpret
It'd all be so simple if I was rich (But I'm not)
But I'm not so I compensate with thought (I got a lot)
I got a lot of nothin' that you need to know (Ay yo)
You would think he wasn't aware of the glow (Where'd you go?)
Swimmin' in a bottle of imposters
Losin' my ground in the name of takin' it farther
We can thumb wrestle or we can make a daughter
I thought it was supposed to get easier when you worked harder
Stole the city, I still feel helpless
Baited the hook and caught me a selfish
I'm gonna gut it, clean it, cook it, feed it to a she
And see if I can get her to need me
You might also like
And now I'm standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'ma tap her on the shoulder, I'ma give her a clue
Standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue

All it takes is a stroll down the street
A pro and he greets a new soul he'd like to meet
Showed you the beating of the artery he keeps on the end of his sleeve
As he pretends he can breathe
Lend me a piece of your superiority
I feel alone on this mission, I'm wishin' there was more of me
A pair of me, apparently I'm a parasite caught inside a paradox
A paradise, a parody, the hair police have got what you need
For you to get over me and move on with Godspeed
I'd let it all go and break eggs for a livin'
If I wasn't so conditioned to just take what I'm given
Get it, got it, catch it, caught it, and lost it
Yet I can't stop it, it's embedded in my optics
Plus the frustration is a product of the gossip
If you can't walk away can you at least change the topic?
Overextended the amount of time allotted
Broke the engine, I don't know, cracked the block
Now I'm standin' at this gravel roadside festival
And I ain't tryin' to move cause this view is incredible
Standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue
Standin' at the bottom of the steps
And if I tilt my head a little I can look up her dress
And I'm willin' to bet that she'd move if she knew
So I'mma tap her on the shoulder, I'mma give her a clue

Fall in love with all of she (Fall in love with all of she)
Hasn't stopped callin' me (Hasn't stopped callin' me)
Message in a bottle (There's a message in a bottle)
And I stepped inside a pothole (I stepped inside a pothole)
Somehow forgot my name (Somehow forgot my name)
Blew out the flame (She blew out the flame)
A means to an end (A means to an end)
Can't even be friends, it's a song about a friend
She's still in my dreams (She steals all my dreams)
Angel spread your wings (Angel spread your wings)
Tryin' to comprehend (I'm still tryin' to comprehend)
Can't even be friends, it's a song about a friend

All together...(Crowd: WHOOO!)
Smile while you do that shit, you know what I'm saying?
Cause like some of ya'll, if you ain't smilin' you're ugly I swear to God
Alright,  some mean mugs
Alright, on the count of three. 1. 26Embed
