Trappin' work, bando
Money callin', bank roll
Always ballin', I flex ho
I got all this damn dough (Yeah!)
I got all this damn dough
I got all this damn dough
I got all this damn dough
I got all this damn dough

Margiela, nigga
That be the hyped up
He said that nigga
Take her from my block (No way!)
That be a lie
I pull out the strap
With infrared beam
And turn that bitch nigga to cyclops
Jesus piece
With the praying hands, they cost a grip
Gotcha main bitch all on Lil Uzi dick
I whip and I whip
I sip and I sip
Coordinating some bitches on that pack
Now they all up in my mitt
I'ma ride up in the semi
I just talked to Kur and he riding out with me
Kickin' your door if you owe me all the Benji's
Clip big as hell, so that old ho like a 50 piece
Bitch nigga tendencies
You not a friend of me
You are not one of me
You are my enemy
Gettin' that chopper got bitch on me
That bitch go "blaww"
I'm kickin' the shit with my squad like we playing soccer
I'm getting that money, to a fifty and hundred
I'm trappin' and trappin'
These niggas look at me like I am their father
You might also like
Trappin' work, bando
Money callin', bank roll
Always ballin', I flex ho
I got all this damn dough (Yeah!)
I got all this damn dough
I got all this damn dough (Uh, uh, uh!)
I got all this damn dough (Uh!)
I got all this damn dough

Shout-out to Molly, shout-out to me
Wait! Shout-out to Phil with the lean
Before I was rappin' had low self esteem
Now I got bad bitches all on they knees
Now I fuck bitches that wear Maybelline
Can't make this up, this shit's not make believe
Dre in the bushes, he plottin' on niggas
Oh my God he got a chop' with a beam!
And suckin' dick, what the fuck do you mean?
Kur is so dirty, Kur is so broke
Stupid lil' bitch I got knots in my jeans!
Same old bitch that was callin' me ugly!
Look at her now, That bitch mouthing me clean
I know my niggas ain't coppin' no pleas
None of y'all niggas can't stop for my team!
Uh! Get what we want
Stuntin' on bitches that front
Bitch can I fuck? "No, you must wait a month"
Come on lil' ho are you dumb?
I do it big like I'm Pun
All of these rappers my sons, uh
'Case you ain't know, that bitch you love
Me and her we've ran a train, uh
Made her our ho
Boys know I got 'em, it was all love from the start
Never show love in the dark, always show love in the light
We mix the lean with the Sprite
Yo' bitch ain't spendin' the night
Yo' bitch not even my type
Fucked her so you could get mad!
I fucked her now you wanna fight, hah!
Trappin' work, bando
Money callin', bank roll
Always ballin', I flex ho
I got all this damn dough (Yeah!)
I got all this damn dough
I got all this damn dough
I got all this damn dough
I got all this damn dough3Embed
