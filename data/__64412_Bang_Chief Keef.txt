Bang
Bang
Bang
Bang, bang

That smoke's got me gone, you can hear it in the air
We on top like some stairs
I don't give no fuck, I be goin' to Hell (All or nothing)
Can't fuck around with bitches, niggas
'Cause they be acting like hoes
There's a lot of hoes out here, though
But I'm gon' let this hammer blow, like
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
I'm gon' let this hammer blow, like
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
I'm gon let this hammer blow, like—

Choppers gettin' let off
Now, they don't want no war
Thirty clips and them .45s, gotta go back to the store
And that Kush gettin' smoked, gotta go back to the store
Back to the store, my mans gon' blow
So they ass better get low or get hit
Oh, shit
That Bulldog made his ass split
I'm tryna get rich, fuck a bitch
Only thing she for is to give head
I'm talkin' this dick
If she snitch, she can get the thirty clip (Bang, bang)
All we know is bang and then dip
And them bangers hollow tips
I swear to God, that shit dead
Let's show these niggas how we do it
We got big hawks and Eagles that's gon' knock you out your shoes
You better be a smart nigga
On that R.I.P. Dart, nigga
Two bangers, going hard, nigga
Soft nigga, go hard, nigga
You might also like
That smoke's got me gone, you can hear it in the air
We on top like some stairs
I don't give no fuck, I be goin' to Hell
Can't fuck around with bitches, niggas
'Cause they be acting like hoes
There's a lot of hoes out here, though
But I'm gon' let this hammer blow, like
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
I'm gon' let this hammer blow, like
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
I'm gon let this hammer blow, like—

Glock 9, TEC-9, thirty clip, .45
When we hit him, he ain't comin' back
Smokin' loud, this Buddy loud, so I ain't comin' back
And I'm Chief Keef, bitch
Off a pill, I feel like E.T., bitch
When I hit, you spin like a CD, bitch
Can't get caught by CPD, bitch
My nigga Dooski, he got my back
Just bring a nine, we ain't got a MAC
You better listen, we got the MAC
And on your back, we make the 'Nolia clap
We got fifty-shot TECs, so don't get wet
We gon' make some bullets rain on your block
Your bitch suckin' all on my cock
On the block, we the chop shop
Smokin' stank, all we know is bang
Fuck runnin' train, we gon' roll a train
Big propane like Novacaine
Chief Keef, bitch, I'm so insane
It's Glory Boyz, Lamron
Wiiic City and Blackgate
Young Money and 46
Flip a nigga like patty cake (Bang, bang)
That smoke's got me gone, you can hear it in the air
We on top like some stairs
I don't give no fuck, I be goin' to Hell
Can't fuck around with bitches, niggas
'Cause they be acting like hoes
There's a lot of hoes out here, though
But I'm gon' let this hammer blow, like
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
I'm gon' let this hammer blow, like
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
Bang (Bang), bang (Bang-bang)
I'm gon let this hammer blow, like—

All or nothing
