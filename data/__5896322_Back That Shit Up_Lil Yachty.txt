8 ContributorsBack That Shit Up Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Brr, ahh)

I'm backing it up
Backing that shit back, I'm backing it up
Backing it, boom-boom, backing it up
Backing that shit back, I'm backing it up
Turn it up back, back that shit up, I be backing it up
In the back of the back, back
Pull out the MAC, told her to back that shit up
Back that shit up, ooh, back that shit up
Back that shit up, backing it up
In the back I keep back to you
Ooh, in the back I keep backing it
In the back I keep backing it
Backing it up, she backing it up
With the gang we throwing it up (Brr)

Going insane, I'm running it up
Too much codeine, it's right in my cup
I'm in the sling, I'm running it up
Pouring up cream, got 4 in my cup
We not the Jones so fuck what you heard
Stay with the stick, I'mma piss up his nerves
I got a way with my words
She get her way with them curves
My bro have his way with them birds
Came a long way from them blow-end 'burbs
All of 'em makeup, it smear on my shirt
Put it on God look like I slid in dirt
Back out them racks, take it straight to the turf
