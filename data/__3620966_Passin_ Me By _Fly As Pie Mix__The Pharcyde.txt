3 ContributorsPassinâ€™ Me By (Fly As Pie Mix) Lyrics
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by

Now in my younger days when I used to sport a shag (Sport a shag)
I would go to school, carry lunch in a bag (In a bag)
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss (Get a kiss)
Always got mad when the class was dismissed (Was dismissed)
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stand, come to my desk
And help me with my problem for it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent or sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up promptly at three o'clock
But I was on the jock, yes indeedy, wrote graffiti on the bus (On the bus)
I'd carve her name then write a plus
With my name last (Last), on the looking glass (Glass)
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by

Now when I dream of fairytales, I think of me and Shelly
'Cause she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play love by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her nigga, but
All I could do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played Truth or Dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop the stride
'Cause I can't have no more of this passin' me by

And I must voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken (Chicken), chasing my tail like a doggie
She was like a star (Star), thinking I was like a fan (Fan)
Damn, she looked good (Good), down side: she had a man (Man)
He was a rooty-toot, he was a nincompoop
She told me, "Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop"
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass, I proved to be a better man
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her:
"My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I feel for you when I try
Or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you"
Signed "Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, P.S. Love Me Tender"
But the letter came back three days later: Return to Sender
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by

She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by1Embed
