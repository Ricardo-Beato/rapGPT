8 ContributorsFlight Risk Lyrics
Got so much jewelry on right now, I'm a flight risk
Got two bad bitches with me right now, these dyke bitches
While you thinking they good, on the other hand, they a flight risk
And I got so much motherfuckin' jewelry on, I'm a flight risk
I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk
I said I got so much fuckin' jewelry on
The metal detector keep goin off like brr-brr!
Cause they know I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk
And the police keep kicking down my mama door
Like "Where the hell is your son coke?"
Cause they know I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk

Gucci, Gucci, super high, baby girl, she super bi
Said she fuck with girls and guys and been like that since junior high
I bet she should recognize, she eat a dick like pumpkin pie
And her ass so B-I-G, G-I-E, she ready to die
Lesson 4: fuck like a whore or it won't be no lesson 5
Baby got those super thighs, she can't fuck you for less than 5
Baby got that whitewater, that super wet, that water slide
Call me talkin' bout 69, I said, shit, I'm on Morgan Drive
68 and owe you one, you hold your breath, you won't survive
Blood red charger, homicide so someone please call Channel 5
Blood red Bentley, think that I stole it, it's not the Jersey Drive
Droptop Rari with one shooter in it screaming "Who wanna die?"

Got so much jewelry on right now, I'm a flight risk
Got two bad bitches with me right now, these dyke bitches
While you thinking they good, on the other hand, they a flight risk
And I got so much motherfuckin' jewelry on, I'm a flight risk
I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk
I said I got so much fuckin' jewelry on
The metal detector keep goin off like brr-brr!
Cause they know I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk
And the police keep kicking down my mama door
Like "Where the hell is your son coke?"
Cause they know I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk

Flight risk on my birth certificate
My mama had a nigga in the kitchen
Flight risk, took off from probation
Flight risk so they don't trust me at the label
My right wrist got my left hand hatin'
Wah gwan?, I just made a mill with my Jamaican
Ball every day and night, and catch flight
Shoot dice, rock ice, pour up lean and Sprite
Flight risk, I'm out this bitch
I ran up on JR but I ain't seen him since
You put that rent money at risk and you gon' get evicted
Cause if the shit don't go as planned, don't take another risk
Got so much jewelry on right now, I'm a flight risk
Got two bad bitches with me right now, these dyke bitches
While you thinking they good, on the other hand, they a flight risk
And I got so much motherfuckin' jewelry on, I'm a flight risk
I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk
I said I got so much fuckin' jewelry on
The metal detector keep goin off like brr-brr!
Cause they know I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk
And the police keep kicking down my mama door
Like "Where the hell is your son coke?"
Cause they know I'm a motherfuckin' flight riskEmbed
