6 ContributorsIntro (Trap House 5) Lyrics
The Sun shines on a dog's ass sometimes
Sometimes you don't laugh now you gotta laugh last
I used to skrray, drop it all, yeah that's real glass
Now I'm first in that class, got that real gas
A bad bitch that match my swag with a real ass
Somebody help me save it, cause I spend it real fast
She said "Gucci Mane I love you, with your dog ass
Shorty fine, drinking lean out a tall glass
I'm balling hard and I wish that all the cash last
I'm hustling hard like I'm trying to get my cash back
I took a loss, had to go into my last sack
Lord Mercy! Money, got to make it all back
They say I'm nice and charming, but I got them mean racks
These niggas say they balling, but they never seen racks
I'm pimpin hard, man, I think I need a mean 'lac
It's Guwop, I took the game and I ain't giving it back
I fell off, but I bet you I ain't falling back
I get your whole clique wacked for like ten stacks
It's Brick Squad 1017 and I mean that
Got Dirty Money just like Diddy. Had to clean that!
I fell off, but I bet you I ain't falling back
I get your whole clique wacked for like ten stacks
It's Brick Squad 1017 and I mean that
Got Dirty Money just like Diddy. Had to clean that!You might also like1Embed
