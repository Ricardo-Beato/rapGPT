7 ContributorsSportscenter Lyrics
Ball player paper you would think I was a draft pick
Zone 6 Brick boy watch score a hundred
Call Dick Vitale cause Gucci a "Diaper Dandy"
DT player I bought a blue Aston
Zone season bricks go up through the attic
If you smoke crack rock then your an addict
Addicted to ballin' kush and bad bitches
Dem big rims is just the way im livin'
I took whole mill and I spent it on a crib
Im in the hood passin kids hundred dollar bills
Kentez you better tell these pussy niggas what it is
Before I make cash show these niggas what it is,(cash)

Baby i ball hard i start so call sportscenter
I was averagin' 80 and that was last winter
Wilt chamberlain yall danglin'
Like crystal
Benchwarmer sit out 'til next season nigga
Baby i ball hard i start so call sportscenter
I was averagin' 80 and that was last winter
Wilt chamberlain yall danglin'
Like crystal
Benchwarmer sit out 'til next season nigga

Magic City Monday 20 grand Monday
Samething next week call that shit a replay
72' Chevy Caprice is a slam dunk
Mossberg sawed off call that shit a double boom
AK-47 make a nigga 360
Airmax airbubble cost me 150
Tall money Yao Ming taller than Nowitzki
Wilt Cham. bitch baller of the century
23 inch Davins sitin on a Bentley
If you dont like it then dont ride wit me
Sportscenter shit made highlight of the century
Came to the club wit a chain worth a milli
Take it to the paint jump Gucci shoot a 3,(I will)
Waitin on Gucci you be waitin for a week
Take it to the paint Gucci Gucci shoot a 3,(swishy)
Im so iced out my left wrist on freeze

I know yall think that Im just rappin'
Im vacuum sealin and saran wrappin'
36 Oz and the inner tube a baggy
54 Oz thats a brick and a halfy
So much money put my stacks in a baggy
So many razors I damn near bust the baggy
08' bently money taller than Nowitzki
Dikembe Mutombo or Oprah Winfrey
Like vending machine I keep that coke
So much powder I can make a snowman
Like a vendin machine i keep that coke
So much powder I can make a snowman, Ho man1Embed
