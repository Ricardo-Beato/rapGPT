13 ContributorsJones Indiana Lyrics
Yeah, she went to Vienna
First day alone, Indiana (Yeah)
Two guns, Jones Indiana, hey
Cook him broad day, Benihanas (Yeah)
On the bus, put me under, hey
I just want the boss to be honest (Yeah)
Told her, "Ayy, who your friend? Put me on it," ayy
My hoes in the crowd, what we on? Look
Call me Sosa Corleone
Runnin' up a sack what we on
Used to tell the plug, "Put me on"
OG would be like hurry home (Yeah)
We gon' fuck it up, then we gone
We don't care who's shit we on (Yeah)
Bitch know the sack super long
Bitch know the weed super strong (Yeah)
Niggas aware of what's goin' on, yeah
Fuck all that shit, movin' on (Yeah)
White ice shinin', lookin' chrome
I can outsmoke Tommy Chong (Yeah)
I can outsmoke Snoop Dogg, yeah
Police chase me with two dogs, yeah
Petty case out in Sioux Falls, yeah
You niggas drag queens, RuPaul, yeah
Shoot three, pimp two hoes, yeah
Trap phone, I missed two calls, yeah
Me and Slick talk through calls, yeah
Said niggas gotta feel, pause (Yeah)
Niggas better have steel jaws, yeah
You don't know how to peel on, yeah
Country motherfucker, Lil Paul, yeah
You a man, Sonic Hedgehog, yeah
Pants still sag real low, yeah
You ain't never been in real smoke, yeah
Left and right wrist kilos, yeah
Man these niggas funny, Elmo, yeah
Friends cross you like a railroad
I ain't talkin' arm, smokin' out the elbow, yeah
Diamonds keep slices of road, yeah
If you get money, go go, yeah
Chill out 'fore you uh, oh no
The booty numero uno, yeah
Clap clap clap, kudos, yeah
Kind of pole is that, who knows? Yeah
In a flat with two stoves, yeah
My chef ain't runnin' two stoves, yeah
Big number jumpin' through loopholes
I call Coozie and them hoes, yeah
Get a new bitch just how I get new clothes, yeah
Two watches, Pumbaa and Timon, yeah
It's gettin' all on 'em, ice cream cone, yeah
Pull on my Nike, my VLONE
Lost the top on this Oyster
Slidin' slippery like some moisture
These double V's doin' torture
Try to take my shit, I torch you
Damn the neck got hoarser
She just popped my shit like Wilson
I just laid out like a poster
Gettin' blew with the explosive
You niggas salty just like Lawry's
If diamonds is people, this is a party
It don't get broke up by the tsunami
It ain't nothin' like new money
I been been been smokin' loud
'Fore they started makin' blue money, yeah
Kay Kay want a white bunny, yeah
Black man gettin' white money
Your ho fuck around like money
Can't fit these blue hundreds, white hundreds
Them twenties don't feel the same color
My son told me that I can't color
I don't know fam, we ain't brothers
'Member Bam Bam gettin' commas, ayy
It's so fuckin' fake, you can't cuddle
If you in our way in the club, ayy
Y'all know you can't come, nah
Told them to make another charm
Don't know what it is 'til he done, yeah
