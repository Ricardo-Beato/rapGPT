Lil Uzi, cartel (D-D-D-D-Deko)

Cartel (Huh), Cartel (Huh)
Cartel (Huh), Cartel, Cartel (Lil Uzi), Cartel
Cartel, Cartel, Cartel, Cartel
Cartel, Cartel, Cartel, Cartel
Cartel (Cartel), I swear, I love my cartel
They traffic, they move it through mail (Mail)

They traffic, they move it through—

My money is lookin' real well (Wow), and I would not sell my soul (No)
But I just worked like hell, and I been just sippin' a pint
And I'm been into a law, never holdin' me back (Nah)
An opp never holdin' me down (Nah), these goofy ass niggas be clown (Yeah)
Until they get hit with the pound (Yeah)
They life flash before their eyes both, they fall to the face, and they mouth hit the ground (Yeah)
All my niggas be dogs (Dogs), don't make me call up the hound (Go)
They will put you right down (Yeah), they spittin' them infamous rounds (Brrt, brrt)
We on top and you way under
Don't see a hater, like I'm Stevie Wonder
Sixty racks top a brick, that's a quick returner
Straight from the 99 Number One Stunna (Ya heard me)
Hit her deep, that's my number one gunner
All year around, we travel everyday is summer (In Miami)
Countin' big face hundreds, pockets big like 80 hummers
No child abuse, when I whip the baby up (Damn)

They traffic, they move it through mail (Through mail)
They traffic, they move it through mail (Through mail)
I swear, I love my cartel
They traffic, they move it through mail
They traffic, they move it through mail (They do)
They traffic, they move it through mail (Uh)

Whip it, diamonds like ATL Benji
Blowin' the cash all at Lennox
Whippin' the white off the pigeon
Yeah, the clip always extended
Codeine and Sprite got me dippin'
They throwin' your time, now you snitchin'
It's crazy how bitches be bitchin'
The trap on the block, got me richer
And she bounce the dick, like she switches
Niggas talkin' they dissin'
My trigger finger just be itchin'
Yeah. I got weight. but ain't lifting
I switch positions. they missin'
Got bitch work at Onyx, she strippin'
Want me buy her shit, but she trippin', she trippin'
On top of me jockin' me, suckin' me, properly, actually sucking me, sloppily
50 in hundreds, my wrists'll be bopping
Got so much damn money, I start speakin' Guapense
Lettucce and broccoli bread with a lot of cheese
Honestly, none of you niggas is hot as me, honestly
None of you niggas is hot as me, bitches on my dick, and they just be jockin' me
Codeine and promethazine, that's the dietary
It's lot of demons is always inside of me
Honestly, when I die have a riot, please
She keep on sayin' "No", but she keep eyein' me
I got so much guap, and that bitch rely on me
I never cut a check, and, no, I'm not lyin', B
No, I'm not lyin', B, no, I'm not lyin', B
Cartel, cartel, cartel, cartel
