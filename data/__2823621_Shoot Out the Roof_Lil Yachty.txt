Yeah, I see everything that happens
You know what I’m sayin'?
I see all you little niggas, jockin' and bitin' style
Niggas ain’t me, bruh, niggas can’t be me
Nigga won't be, you feel me?
I know you niggas wanna be part of the game, but you niggas can’t be me
The fuck, nigga?
Like, I only got one little brother in this motherfucker, you feel me?
Only got one little brother in this motherfucker that’s rockin' wit' me, nigga (JBan$)
The rest of you little niggas, you little niggas is just biting swag, nigga
Gimme my swag back, I don’t fuck with these niggas

Nigga you ain't Uzi, you ain't Carti, damn sure not me
Never on the scene, what you mean? Nigga, yadda mean
Ballin' like Yao Ming, paint her face, nigga, just like Sting
Came up poppin' beans, then I dropped it 'cause I'm not a fiend
All you niggas wanna be me, rub the pussy for a genie
Your bank account lookin' teeny, Tina Turner, big burner
Young nigga too rich for a fight, new crib on a kite
Penthouse, living large, youse a broke boy rapping 'bout a dream
You ain't never shot the steam, stop lyin' to the teens
Big Benz, too clean, three thousand dollar jeans
Three times three, nine in the jeans, spent that on my sister
Ghost ride the old Fisker, ball hard like Derek Fisher
Ridin' 'round with my niggas, ridin' 'round with my niggas
All my niggas do is
You might also like
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof

Niggas sneaky like mice
Just got a new bitch, white with a little black like dice
Niggas think I'm too nice, I'll still slap a nigga next year
Wait 'til I switch the gear, nigga never checked the rear
Nah, cause I'm only going one way, one way, bitch, on the runway
Six bitches want me, nigga, thats a fun day
All my niggas with me they keep gunplay, gunplay
Lil Boat

Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof5Embed
