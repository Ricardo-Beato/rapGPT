22 ContributorsROTTEN Lyrics
Y'all ready?
This tag is hard, it sound like a spaceship door opening

Okay there's moments where I feel like I'm the hottest
My baby not religious but she look just like a goddess
They want me to flex, they don't want me to be modest
In 2027 I'll be purchasing a cottage
I'll be purchasing a cottage
Pokémon kush, yeah, this shit look like a Oddish
I was in the pussy and that shit had me astonished
I ain't playing tag but your new shit is not it
Nah, your new shit is not it
CÎROC and Hpnotiq, I'm way out of pocket (I'm way out of, way out of)
Quit all the gossip, I'm simply a product of people I rock with
Ayy, my shorty so rotten, the coochie like cotton
You know how I'm rockin' (Ayy)
You know how I'm rockin'
You know how I'm rockin'

Ayy, more money, more problems, big popper
I don't answer 'less she call me big poppa
Ridin' through the night and I'm duckin' from the coppas'
When this shit drops it gon' be a panty droppa' (Facts)
Rollin' with the top up, you could get mopped up
I was at the crib when she scooped me in the Mazda (Mazda)
Got a whole roster and they all like to get high like Rastas
I just like to watch, diamonds on me dancing like ZaZa
I just met your girl and took her to the Crowne Plaza
Hit it five minutes into Devil Wears Prada
Once I leave town we ain't talking 'bout nada
(We ain't talking 'bout shit)
Now she got my name in her internet browser
Shorty bipolar, she sweet then sour
I got me a Georgia Peach just like Bowser (Bowser)

Okay there's moments where I feel like I'm the hottest
My baby not religious but she look just like a goddess (True)
They want me to flex, they don't want me to be modest
In 2027 I'll be purchasing a cottage
I'll be purchasing a cottage
Pokémon kush, yeah, this shit look like a Oddish
I was in the pussy and that shit had me astonished
I ain't playing tag but your new shit is not it
Nah, your new shit is not it
CÎROC and Hpnotiq, I'm way out of pocket (I'm way out of, way out of)
Quit all the gossip, I'm simply a product of people I rock with
Ayy, my shorty so rotten, the coochie like cotton
You know how I'm rockin' (Ayy)
You know how I'm rockin'
You know how I'm rockin'

Smush it, cook it, freeze it, let it dry (Let it dry)
45 for a half for a whole Jerry Rice (For a whole Jerry Rice)
I done scored on every block nigga, Fisher Price (Like I'm Fisher Price)
'Cause I stay down when they was cheatin' like I'm Derek Fisher wife (Like Derek Fisher wife)
I ain't never seen Christ, why would I pray to him? (Why would I pray to him?)
Granny tell me to repent, I can't be saved again (Can't be saved again)
I'm takin' pills tryna' kill all the pain I feel (All the pain I feel)
We gon' push more Hank than a King of the Hill (King of the Hill)
Tryna finesse the game, on point, shaving grams (Point, shaving grams)
I'ma snake 'em one more time and shed this dead skin (Shed my dead skin)
When I try to leave the streets I hit a dead end (A dead end)
Grey Silverado truck outside my man crib (Outside my man crib)
All because he scrapin' white, shit like dandruff (Straight)
Off a big pile of brown like a ant hill (I'm a dawg)
Start rapping, I ain't stop making gram deals (I'm a big dawg)
Big dog, I can't make no hand-to-hand sales (I'm a big dawg)
I can't go broke 'long as I know what the plan is (Yeah)
Okay there's moments where I feel like I'm the hottest
My baby not religious but she look just like a goddess
They want me to flex, they don't want me to be modest
In 2027 I'll be purchasing a cottage
I'll be purchasing a cottage
Pokémon kush, yeah, this shit look like a Oddish
I was in the pussy and that shit had me astonished
I ain't playing tag but your new shit is not it
Nah, your new shit is not it
CÎROC and Hpnotiq, I'm way out of pocket
Quit all the gossip, I'm simply a product of people I rock with
Ayy, my shorty so rotten, the coochie like cotton
You know how I'm rockin' (Ayy)
You know how I'm rockin'
You know how I'm rockin'3Embed
