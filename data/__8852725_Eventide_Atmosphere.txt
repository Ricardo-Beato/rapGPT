4 ContributorsEventide Lyrics
It's like you like pretending not to hear me
But at least you pull it off insincerely
And if I ever stop bitching and complaining
Then clearly I'm on the right drugs severely
Block the dealer, stop communications
Never been a healer, never had a lot of patience
I feel like I've been saving all my grace for a day like today
Put the phone down and get out-of-formation
It's like you like to focus on the hyphens
The minus, the negative, the lifeless
So how are we supposed to find alikeness
You try to enjoy your time, I'm trying to avoid your crisis
The cosmos reapplied the cosmetics
Disguise the reasons why we decide to keep our feelings inside
I can't justify, the fuck am I?
Tried to stay awake but realized I ain't gonna make it through tonight

Still I will
Love until
Is it real
Still I will
When we're real
When we're still
Still I will love until
Love until
You might also like
It's like you like to ruin all your shoes
Trying to prove that you've got nothing to prove
Continue the performance till the thorn is removed
Fighting in a war that's yours to lose
I keep my arm on the window leaning into the turns
But don't nobody wanna be the king of the worms
I guess sometimes you gotta learn to disagree with the terms
We lit the bridge on fire just to feel as it burns and
It's like you like the lights and the sirens
We're still attracted to the voice of violence
If survival depends on the appliance of tone
I'd prefer to be smiling on a deserted island alone
I would shrink into the skyline if I could fly
'Cause obviously most of us drinking our own cyanide
Won't you think about what you believe it means to be alive
Synchronize then sink into the eventide

Still I will
Love until
Is it real
Still I will
When we're real
When we're still
Still I will love until
Love until
Love until
Love until
Love until
Love until
Love until
Love until
Love untilEmbed
