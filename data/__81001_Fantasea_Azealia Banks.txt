Close to the moon
Close to the moon
Close to the moon
Oh so close to the moon
Close to the moon
Close to the moon
I wanna take you so close

A passion for life, fantastic
Nest egg in a gold basket, next to go
I'ma hug and kiss the good life, X n' O
Hey, feel better than X and Blow
Get high from my line, turn text to notes
Get these niggas gassed up like Texaco
Watch your bitch pop like Pepsi Co
Ever since I was an embryo, had magic flow
Young dynamo, young killa
Young illa with the finer flow
Young rapido, never will, never half a hoe
Came to celebrate and have a toast
Young sis is living fancy, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

I wanna take you so close
Close to the moon, boy me and you
Oh, so close to the moon
If that’s okay with you, close to the moon, and
I wanna take you so close
Fantasea
I’ll be your fantasea
I’ll be your fantasea
I’ll be
Take you close
You might also like
Fast forward, lived half your life
No wrong ‘cause the cash was right
Have a bitch blink twice like hazard light
More the great way, pass suffice
Non-believers all asinine
Bring the fever like fahrenheit
Round the world like satellite
Baby girl got, baby girl got options, right?
PJ to the PH, pass the light
Far from the passive type, I excite your life
And that’s it, better than your average
Status: captain, mothership to the bliss, imagine
Anything you want you could have it
Trip-trip-trippy on the magic
Do you really really want the access
Of the phoenix fire and ashes?
Coin and the cash in, no quote and no ration
Numbers on the masses, wonders of the na-tion
Anything you want is established
Anything you want you can have it

Close to the moon, boy me and you
Oh, so close to the moon
If that’s okay with you, close to the moon, and
I wanna take you so close
Fantasea
I’ll be your fantasea, I’ll be your fantasea
I’ll be
I’ll be your fantasea, I’ll be your fantasea
I’ll be
So close to the moon, boy me and you
Oh, so close to the moon
If that’s okay with you, close to the moon, and
I wanna take you so close
Close to the moon, boy me and you
Oh, so close to the moon
If that’s okay with you, close to the moon, and
I wanna take you so close

Life is a series of choices
What you eat, how you look
Whether you do drugs or not
See, only you can decide because the only person responsible is you
And if you make the right choice, there’s nothing you can’t accomplish
If you make a wrong choice, all of the other decisions are made for you

Close to the moon, boy me and you
Oh, so close to the moon
If that’s okay with you, close to the moon, and
I wanna take you so close
Fantasea
I’ll be your fantasea, I’ll be your fantasea
I’ll be
I’ll be your fantasea, I’ll be your fantasea
I’ll be
So close to the moon, boy me and you
Oh, so close to the moon
If that’s okay with you, close to the moon, and
I wanna take you so close5Embed
