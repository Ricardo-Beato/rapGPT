25 Contributors3's Company Lyrics
S.D., O.T
Breezy, Snoop D-O-double-G and O.T. (O.T., O.T.)
Snoop D

I got twenty-five ways I can get it
And twenty homeboys that's fully with it
It's only gon' take 'bout thirty minutes
From the effects that you feel from the bag of spinach (Ah)
It's vintage, authentic, I have no limits
C-Walk in the party, let the Crips up in it
To handle our business, baby, put your back up in it
C.B., O.T., yeah, we back up in it (Ooh-wee)
The West Coast do the most, take a drag of the dope
House party like a motherfucker, full of my folks
Hendog, O.E. and a couple of P's
Pile of seeds, weed, and a couple of G's
Ooh-wee, I got the mic, it's my turn
The roof is on fire, let that motherfucker burn
We don't need no water if your daughter is hot
Just send her to the Dogg so I can woop-de-wop

Sexy girl, you came to party
You and your girlfriend
Three's company (Yeah)
Girl, I don't mind, fun times
Oh, baby, let me see you walk (Walk), step to me (Oh)
This way when you shake that booty (Ayy! Oh, booty)
Hit your walk (Walk), hop to it (To it)
I'ma show you how a real player do it
You might also like
Skip, skip, skip, skip (Skip), skip (Skip)
I'm a Long Beach nigga, Long Beach Crip (Crip)
C-Walk the party, big thang on the hip (Hip, yeah)
Gun never tiny, you can kiss this tip (Muah!)
Hatnin'? Got the stick like Magic (Yeah)
Hit it, let her fall for the silver sand
But I don't drink it straight, where the Kool-Aid? (Kool-Aid)
Leave a nigga bloody like bootleg (Bop)
I'm a Northside nigga (Nigga), stand on my toes (Go)
Sisqó nigga (Nigga), stayin' on the hoes (Hoes)
Heard she a flip (Yeah), ran off her clothes (Woah)
Threw her in the air (Wee), landed on the bros (Oh)
O.T., S.D., C.B, geeked
Any nigga say some', gotta see me (Ha)
Thirty-six O's, smell funky (What? What? What?)
Double and give it up, chunky

Sexy girl, you came to party (Yeah)
You and your girlfriend (Huh)
Three's company (Three, baby)
Girl, I don't mind, fun times (You better let me see you)
Oh, baby, let me see you walk (Walk), step to me (Oh)
This way when you shake that booty (Ayy! Oh, booty)
Hit your walk (Walk), hop to it (To it)
I'ma show you how a real player do it
I ain't tryna knock your hustle, babe (Yeah)
You know I'm a dog, but this no pettin'
More fire, more loud, we all gettin' blazed (Yeah)
You lookin' like twins, both hands, two bodies
One I'm in the sheets, other one her knees (Sheets)
Mary Jane's a freak, and I love Molly (Molly)
I'm tryna paint two Mona Lisas
One Black, one white, at the same time
Them strobe lights keep flashin'
It's just me and you two in this room (Ooh)
And it feels like déjà vu (Ooh)
Like I been here with you two before
