Sitting on top of the world

I got my motor running, amp pumpin, trunk jumpin, feet poppin
Smoking something, feeling good, feeling like I'm on top of the world (Gangsta Grillz, sitting on top of the world, huh, huh, huh, sitting on top of the world)
She got her Gucci sandals, Gucci shades, Gucci bag, Gucci chain (Yeah, brr)
Say she like that Gucci Mane, so I'm laying on top of your girl (Laying on top of your girl, huh, huh, huh, laying on top of your girl)

Yes, yes (Yes), way too fresh, your baby mama texting me to death
To death, to death, she texting me to death
To death, to death, she texting me to death
When a girl keep on major league, I think she want to rape me
She say she want to stay with me, now she want to take me home (She want to take me home)
I'm a boss just so you know, So Icey Ent., kickin' it down

This is where we roll the credits
Oh, but don't worry

I mean we've both already been payed for the sequel
It's coming up real soon
Get used to it
