30 ContributorsTalk Dat Shit To Me Lyrics
(Amplified)
Well, alright, y'all
Talk that shit to me
Tell it like it T-I-is, my nigga
Talk that shit to me
Uh, talk to me, 'cause I'll talk back
It ain't my fault your girl fell in love with a gangsta mack
Now that's cold, jack
Talk that shit to me
Peter Piper picked a pimp to play the game with passion
Made power plays with paper while they folded like a pamphlet
Protectin' my progression, politickin' for the people
Platinum with Doggystyle, "Deep Cover" was the prequel
Polarizin', prophesizin', I'm what put us on the map
At Poly bustin' down them P-O-U-N-D's into them sacks
Poundin' pavement with the pushers, pocket rocket for the pussies
Player tried to play me cold, I left him bleedin' in the bushes
I'm like a pigeon with precision, Snoopy shittin' from the top
Piggly Wigglys on patrol, tryna pop us at the park
Partner, please, we just posted up, we plottin' on some paper, man
Just popped a Pontiac and peach is probably what I'll paint the thang
Papered up, I can't complain
Still, I play the game, but it won't ease the pain
My homies passin' earlier than they 'posed to
Pop 'pagne in the Porsche
Most powerful Crip to ever throw up gangs on a poster

Talk that shit to me
From the LBC
Talk that shit to me (Talk that shit to me)
It's levels to this game
Got to earn your stripes
Bitch, if you ain't breakin' bread
Then you need to get a life (Talk that shit to me)

Crip without a crush, cocket full of cucks, check that
Cock it then I cuss, count one in the clutch, step back, swish
This Crippin' collision causing catastrophes
My casual conversations end up turnin' to casualties
Cold game, cat crackin' with Kokane
Go against the gang, we got a cellar with your name on it
Showstopper that dropped classics
The same nigga that closed curtains will close caskets
'Cause the crew on it too like compilation tracks
Runnin' numbers up, but it ain't no miscalculatin' that
Goin' kamikaze for me and my concentration camp
'Fore we had to take it back, 'cause really ain't no cake in that
Cryptolite
Play Superman, I'll be your Kryptonite
Took the nigga's citch 'cause she'd rather fuck a Crip tonight
Get this right, can't call yourself a king unless your clique is right
You niggas better get your Crippin' right
