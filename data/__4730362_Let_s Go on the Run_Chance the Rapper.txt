Ooh, ooh
Ooh,  ooh

Hey  there, lovely sister
Won't you come home to your mister?
I've got plans to hug and kiss ya
I've  got plans to hug and hug and hug you
Let's  go on the run (Ooh, ooh)
Let's go on the run
It's  time to hit the road
We got one place to go (Ooh, ooh)

Peace poof
Meep-meep, I feel like Road Runner
I  get my feet loose
I got that Superman hidden under my cheap suit
Sittin', just waitin' for Lois to wanna leave too, me too
I swear we gotta get away, anywhere that we can
Just meet me by the water, I'll be there with the sand
And if it goes left, that's according to plan
Sometimes you gotta chop the wagon off of the band

She broke up with her boyfriend
The people wanna know what he said
They wanna know the way how
You can break her heart like that
Through it all, I could see someone with personality
Someone who doesn't think like me
Someone who doesn't feel like me
I wanna run away now
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
I wanna run away now
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
(Check, check, check)
Ch-Check it out

Baby, we dippin', tell me who's whippin'
Let's beat the traffic, give it a whippin'
These niggas lame, they think they different
With all that extra-ass advice but don't nobody listen
Baby, I'm deeper than a iceberg with only the tip in
That's why you passed the open Mike when I was only Pippen
I say we move down to Atlanta, get a big ol' house
With a giant pair of Timbs just to kick folks out
Get outta here
Ain't nobody talkin' to you (Ooh, ooh)
And be unbothered (Ooh, ooh)
And be unbothered
We'll move farther and farther and farther away (Yeah)

Hey there, lovely sister
Won't you come home to your mister?
I've got plans to hug and kiss ya
I've got plans to hug and hug and hug you
Let's go on the run (Ooh, ooh)
Let's go on the run
It's time to hit the road
We got one place to go (Ooh, ooh)

(Ooh)
Ooh, ooh
Don't hyperventilate
Keep the lyric cool like Cole Bennett Lemonade
The boy got aluminum foil on his dinner plate
Lot of matcha and lattes when it's gettin' late
The mattresses can inflate
Walk out like a zombie from the stu' and assimilate
Humans to simulate
Morning in the bed, close the lights and dim the drapes
Always Matt Damon when you come Jimmy Kimmel late
Tryna fill the shoes, Nick Cannon with rental skates
Pissed like urinal cakes
I'm ready, I'm finna take the long ride home
Like the end of a limo date
Rolled the window down so hard that the window break
And toss out my demo tape

Ooh, ooh1Embed
