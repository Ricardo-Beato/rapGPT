67 ContributorsBlow Up Lyrics
La, la la la, la la la

Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey, hey, y'all got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I'm about to blow up

Uh-huh, say what?
Bitch I'm about to blow up
Hey, I came up, I warmed up, the next up
Bitch I'm about to blow up

Huh, uh, now don’t it sound legendary?
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I’m blowing up, and bitch, I’m still me
But what's the cost to live your dream, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money, chains and whips make me feel free
I’m starring in this bitch, and yeah, I write the show
Fuck the haters, I’m headed to the place you like to go
They say, "What you fighting for?" The game is on life support
And Gary Coleman just passed, life is short
You might also like
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early
Just to get in free and wait for hoes to show up
Heh, but now it's bottles at them tables
Bring the models boy, I'm 'bout to pour up
Uh-huh, you know what?
Huh, bitch I’m about to blow up (La)
Left side, left side, hey (La la la)
Right side, right side, uh-huh (La la la)
Left side, left side, hey (La la la)
Bitch I'm about to blow up (La la la)

Hey, this is a song for my haters
(Bitch I'm about to blow up)
Yeah, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
(Ha, said I'm about to blow up)
Hey, this is a song for my haters
(Uh-huh, bitch I'm about to blow up)
Hey, hey, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
Bitch I’m about to blow up

Mama say I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree, but what that cost you?
You make a good salary just to pay Sallie Mae
That's real as ever, ducking bill collectors like Jehovah’s witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes, tryna let it go
Hit the club, she drop it low, lower than my credit score
Account overdraft, what I got this debit for?
So much debt, it got me drinking, thinking "Bitch I better blow"
I better blow, these hoes ain't checking
For no nigga with no vehicle, you border like Mexico
Heh, hey baby girl, what it look like?
And where ya head at? And what ya cook like?
She said, "Where your bread at? Or what your whip like?
You ain't got one or the other, well brother, good night"
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early
Just to get in free and wait for hoes to show up
Heh, but now it's bottles at them tables
Bring the models boy, I'm 'bout to pour up
Uh-huh, you know what?
Huh, bitch I’m about to blow up (La)
Left side, left side, hey (La la la)
Right side, right side, uh-huh (La la la)
Left side, left side, hey (La la la)
Bitch I'm about to blow up (La la la)

Hey, this is a song for my haters
(Bitch I'm about to blow up)
Yeah, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
(Ha, said I'm about to blow up)
Hey, this is a song for my haters
(Look I'm about to blow up)
Hey, hey, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
Bitch I’m about to blow up

Praise God, it’s hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles?
You mean to tell me everything goin be fine
If I call your hotline and pay $29.99? (Shit)
Well damn, why ain't you say so?
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phones of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it’s case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fuckin' matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you can blow up
And maybe you can blow up
Shit, but you know what?
For now, bitch I’m about to blow up24Embed
