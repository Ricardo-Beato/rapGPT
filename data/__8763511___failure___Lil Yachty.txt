I—I've seen, uh, well, I’ve seen failure a few times
More recently than before actually, you know
It's quite interesting how much more complicated things get when you become, quote-unquote, "Rich and famous"
I say—I say "quote-unquote" because, you know, one man's rich to the next can be a step from poverty
And it’s hard to explain that when you're so narrow-minded, seeing the world with two eyes shut
And I realize that, you know, some people can't feel what they haven't seen
So, there's no point in me trying to explain my troubles, huh
It's not that I don't think that anyone cares
But, I think, like, it's up to me to fix or deal with them, you know?
I kinda look at everything, like, "Well, no matter what, I mean, it could be worse, you know?"
Like, okay, say, say if I lost a finger, I’d be like, "Well, I still have nine"
Or—or even, like, when someone broke into my house I felt like, "Well, I’m certain they needed it more than I did, these things are replaceable, you know?"
It kinda just helps with stress levels to think that way, you know?
Kinda like, uh, "It could be worse, oh, well"
Easier said than done, I'm sure, huh
But, failure?
Oh, man, failure, that took time to understand, you know?
Like, failure doesn’t mean defeat, more so, like, "Try again, shit—shit, try even harder"
Revise your steps and rewrite your future
Failure to me isn't, like, always a negative thing, more so, more so, like, just a way to relook at things
You know, you never know how close you are to successYou might also like4Embed
