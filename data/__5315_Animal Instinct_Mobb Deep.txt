51 ContributorsAnimal Instinct Lyrics
No doubt
Yo, yo
You know how we did on The Infamous album, right?
Aight
Well, we gon' do it again, son
Yo

Laid up in the cut, watch these rap niggas fuck you up
Dig in shorty guts, get the bitch to set you up
It's the most trifle, 41st Side disciples
Take kindness for a weakness, so I won't be so kind to
Niggas comin' through, I gave you birth, kid, I'm sonnin' you
The Infamous got PC for days
We runnin' through townships, fuckin' shit
Kid, we down shit
Hustle mad bricks, Queensbridge, no doubt, rep the clique
9-6, droppin' wild on some Benzes
Some next shit, crash bar, ask the God
I remember when loadin' up the gats, beef settlin'
Ghetto peddling the Sonder, shorty dead again
Songs about we all around the NC
Cop the E series, jealous ones envy
Hate to see me but got the nerve to wanna be me
I bleach blind 'em, you can't see like Stevie
I'm on TV, Vidbox and all that
Still in the Bridge, now what's fuckin' with that?
You might also like
To all my Mobb crimey, money-hungry and grimy
Mobb sheisty, Godfather III, and Gotti
Rapper Noyd, Ty Maxx, and Ty Nitty
Scarface and Gambino, New York City
It's P live and direct, stab the neck
Icepick bloodied up your whole entire shit
Live shit, one-nine-nine-six, ask your bitch
My crew run wild, snatch chains and bracelets
Your time's wasted for figuring P
There's two sides of me
Snake niggas obviously
You get lumped somethin' horribly and then we calmly
Guzzle Spumantely and Dom PÃ©rignonly
Move through crowds, overproof the fuck out
After God drinks, had to shoot our fuckin' way out
Sparks flyin', niggas dyin', bitches cryin' and shout
Mobb niggas to the exit, we out

9-6 load up the clips, the Infamous apocalypse
QBC on the L-I-E and sippin' Hennessey
And Remy, V-S-O-P, Ty Nitty jiggy
Eyes forever chinky, up in the Marriott
Tons of hydro, black tuxedo, lay low
The five-oh-migos, the gigolo, what, nigga?
My technique, official white meat
Internal bleeding, he felt heat, then cold feet
QBC committee, Ty Nitty, hit the safe
The Filipinos had mad ice and gold plates
We escape, ain't no turnin' back to Stat
Pushin' back-to-back Acs, gettin' cheddar
Drug smugglin' tristate, castin' faith
We don't hesitate, we regulate and evaluate, cut the cake

My crew worthy, blood, sweat, and tears
And dirty gears for years, extort niggas and drink beers
Tired of livin' life this way, crime pay
But for how long 'til you reach your downfall?
Thug niggas surround y'all, four pound y'all
Animal instinct, these niggas gettin' clapped on instinct
I'm tired of livin' life this way, crime pay
But for how long 'til you reach your downfall?
My crew worthy, blood, sweat, and tears
And dirty gears for years, extort niggas and drink beers
Tired of livin' life this way, crime pay
But for how long 'til you reach your downfall?
Thug niggas surround y'all, four pound y'all
Animal instinct, these niggas gettin' clapped on instinct
I'm tired of livin' life this way, crime pay
But for how long 'til you reach your downfall, nigga?
Motherfucker, word up8Embed
