44 ContributorsPlanet God Damn Lyrics
Yeah, I think I'm stuck inside nostalgia
My mind are in the times when this love was so divine
But now it's feelin' like without ya
Feelin' like how the fuck did
We get into a place we ain't accustomed to lovin' inside of
I know I'm out of my mind more often than not
You know I'm used to givin' this all that I got, yeah
It's not a waste when that smile on your face
You tell me you outta place, you parked in my spot
Okay, baby, this a piece of cake
We could lay up on the beach, you could feed me grapes
This my favorite song, spin it â€˜til the needle breaks
We could quit the whole game, do the real estate thing
It's how you beat the case
Put in work, turn that pussy to the office
Be on top of your game, this here a goddess

And I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly

Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na

Okay, no mishaps, this, that, and the third
Don't go back on my word, yeah, I keep that shit gift-wrapped
Your pussy a ride better than Six Flags, I'm in that
No takeaways, no givebacks
No question, we've been through adolescence
And changin' direction, yeah, I paid attention to it
It's never been easy but now it's gettin' ruthless
A little more pain, that's just better music
Girl, what's on your brain? 'Cause that head is stupid
Lotta people suck a dick, but you can execute it
Perfect timin', don't you add another second to it
Don't you ever-ever-ever-ever-ever do it
Yeah, head pollution, conflict resolution
Keep it true, everything that I do witchu

I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly

Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
We don't have to pretend
We both know how it ends
I just need your presence
Wanna feel you feel me
Yeah, you just landed from the Planet God Damn, damn
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me
You just landed from the Planet God Damn, damn
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me14Embed
