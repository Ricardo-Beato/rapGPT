4 ContributorsToss It Up (Nu-Mixx) Lyrics
Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversatin', we relaxin', kickin' back
Got you curious for thug passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissin', hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you movin' in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweatin' up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespectin' when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, gettin' busy in the parkin' lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shakin', back-breakin'
When we're tossin' it up

Feel this baby, I like the way it's goin' down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride
Giving me that nice smile
Female I like, what I want to give all night
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up
Baby, let's get it on!
I like the way you please me, baby
The sexy way you tease me, shorty
The way you move your body
It really drives me crazy
Your body's hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me
I like the way you give it to me, baby
You might also like
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
Said I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
Said I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up

Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on

Oh, it's K-Ci, baby, mmm, that want you lady
Oh, don't act so shady
Baby, your taste as fine as gravy
The way you move that thang, you make me wanna sing
Girl, you make my bells ring, make them go ting-a-ling!
Nasty man, I'm here again
Don't want it to ever end
It's feelin' too good
Gimme some more, oh lady, lady
Your body the kind I like-ah
Big booty titillatin' delight-ah
Back it up yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
Said I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
So won't you play on

How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searchin' for paydays
No longer Dre Day: arrivederci
Gone and forgotten, rotten for plottin' Child's Play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Aliz√©
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to?
Laugh at you suckers 'cause you similar
Pretendin' to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screamin' "Compton," but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the 'burbs
Mob on to this new era, cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got Pac rushin' you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up

Toss it up, haha, yeah, no doubt
We send this shoutout...no doubt
And to Lil' Kim who ain't little no more
Girl, you ain't checked the weight scale lately, have you?
You are not little Kim, you fat, get it straight
Toss it up
Puffy, I read your little interview, buddy
You still ain't touchin' us
All that peace talk, look
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street, boy
It's on! Toss it up
Yeah, we took y'all beat
You know who beat we took, yeah, we took y'all beat
'Cause you wasn't rockin' it right
I'm tired of suckers rockin' beats that don't belong to them
This our rap game, this our beat and we tossin' it up
Death Row, Westside, you know it's onEmbed
