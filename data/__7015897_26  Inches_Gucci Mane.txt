2 Contributors26  Inches Lyrics
(DJ motherfuckin' Rell)
Yeah, that's my clique in the building
That boy Gucci Mane LaFlare (Real trap shit)
Zaytoven on the track, dawg
Yeah

Uh, my visu' sag low (Yeah), so my underwear show (Yeah)
More dro with a ho (Uh), 'til she say, "No more" (What?)
Got so much dope, I could make some more
Touch wrong with your finger, baby, roll some up (Yeah)
This the dump all click with the iced-out pinky, shawty
Put you on the track, yeah, you know they gon' lift you (Trap-A-Holics mixtapes)
Put you positions you never even knew (Knew)
I never seen a real freak bitch likе you (Go)
In the mall, Gucci Mane, we good, how arе you?
Got a seven bag room with a lake side view

Yeah, Gucci Mane LaFlare's in the buildings
Zaytoven's in on the track
They're my clique's motherfuckin' in the house, nigga

I got twenty-six inches on my truck
And you gon' know it when them boys roll up
I keep snacks when I walk in the club
Hell yeah, we keep these hoes geeked up
I got twenty-six inches on my truck
And you gon' know it when them boys roll up
I keep snacks when I walk in the club
Hell yeah, we keep these hoes geeked upYou might also like2Embed
