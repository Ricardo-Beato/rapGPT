Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes (Uh)

I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high (Hey)
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high (Hey)
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high (Hey)
If you ain't up on my level, disappear, please don't reply, bye
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, yeah
Take a sip revive, take a trip to the down south, yeah

I be flying high, can't you tell from my red eyes? (Hey)
Took a trip from Paris down to Houston for your apple pie (Oh-oh)
Where them girls get way too drunk
And they got that in they trunk (Hey)
Now turn around and show the world how you shake that rumpty rump
Say it, we don't fuck with cops
Oh no, we don't fuck with cops (Hey)
In my backseat, I got four freaks who love how my speakers knock
Don't bring no sand to the beach
All we want is love and peace (Hey)
We'll find a girl to bring home 'cause we about to take a flight to go be on, yeah
You might also like
(Oh it's true)
It seems like flying's all I do
(All I do)
There's no one's seated next to you
(Next to you)
In the meantime, I'll watch colors change in the sky
And I'll watch you go by (Get down)

I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
If you ain't up on my level, disappear please don't reply, bye
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, it take long to get this fly
If you ain't up on my level, disappear please don't reply, bye

(Get down)

I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
If you ain't up on my level, disappear please don't reply, bye
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, yeah, I be flying high, shawty
I be flying high, it take long to get this fly
If you ain't up on my level, disappear please don't reply, bye22Embed
