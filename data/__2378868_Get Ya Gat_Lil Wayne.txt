Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat
To all you rich-ass niggas, all you rich-ass niggas
Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat
I went from rich man, nigga
Straight to henchman, nigga
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat
To all you rich-ass niggas, all you rich-ass niggas
Kickin' back, gettin' fat, gettin' tats

And to your fuckboy posse
With they tough boy posture
It's an act
They ain't never got your back
You gettin' jacked
You ain't never gettin' it back
You gettin' wacked
You ain't never comin' back
And cuttin' em slack
We ain't never done 'em that
No
We ain't never did 'em that
And we don't go
Tit for tat
We just Blat
Now he exposed
When we snap
Picture that
He decomposed
He smell like cat
In the trap
Oh
I go psycho
I go rhino
I know his whole side know
My whole fuckin' bio
I'm a K-I-L-L-L-E-R, no typo
I'm a dino
I'm  the kind of nigga that don't give a flying fuck
About another clique but us
Who fly as us?
We flyin' up
Who wanna fuck with us?
Who signin' up?
'Cause I know my clique tough as tusks
That's on a hippopotamus
And I know I'mma sip that stuff
I can't say this is not a must
I must say this shit kinda tough
But fuck it, nigga, bottom's up
Pause
I got time to fuck
So I'mma hit little mama up
And I got millions to blow
And I got Milian to blush
I got Millis, .44's
And I got military guns
And them bitches 'bout to go
Bop-bop like January 1
Got some bitches on the floor
And when I piss they drink it up
I'mma shit on everyone
That shit gon' feel like Kingdom Come
Told my bitch that she the one
And bitch I’m still Miss Cita’s son
And I'm triple OG
My Own Girl, Goon, and Gun

I get a gat, get a gat, get a gat
To all you rich-ass niggas, and you bitch-ass niggas
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat
And tell your fuckboy posse, while you stuntin' we be mobbin'
And we strapped with the gat in all black
So where you at, where you at, where you at?
Yeah, where they at, where they at, where they at?
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat

Yeah, get the gat, get the gat, get the gat
When you a rich little nigga, pussy niggas plot to jack
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Bitch try to take mine, I'm sendin' bullets through ya back
I'm a G, I'm a G, I'm a G
Copped the coupe and the wheels, first day I hit the streets
I match the rags with the mags and the seats
And I be saucin' on these niggas so it all match my sneaks
Damn, you know how east niggas do shit
.40 on my left, on my right a new bitch
Yesterday a ho was trippin' so she gotta go
One thing about pimpin', man, motherfuck a ho
Me and Hoody talkin' cocaine
For the sniffers or the niggas who want whole thangs
Oh man, feel the trigger, make it go bang
So keep a gat, and if they ask, we don't know names
Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat
To all you rich-ass niggas, and you bitch-ass niggas
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat
And tell your fuckboy posse, while you stuntin' we be mobbin'
And we strapped with the gat in all black
So where you at, where you at, where you at?
And where they at, where they at, where they at?
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat

All this white powder
Screaming "White power"
Young Money, Bad Boys
Fat Mike Lowry
Woah
I might shoot up your Ferrari nigga
Oh
Tell your passenger I'm sorry nigga
My young niggas screaming
"Put me in the game, Coach"
Chopper bullets rain
You gon' need a raincoat
My little homie, he got stripes like a Bengal
I got a nephew named Killer, he an Angel
Get money, stay real, that's the game plan
I got a bad bitch and all she do is gang bang
My college ho, on the low, she do the same thing
I got a stripper with a gat and a fat cat
Breakin' niggas off, all my homies call her Kit-Kat
Yeah, she let you hit that
Bet she bring your shit back
Sleepin' with them hoes, get you tied up and kidnapped
Killers at your door, nigga, knock-knock, click-clack
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat
And load it up, load it up, load it up
Where your fuckboy posse, where they at?
Niggas fuck, niggas fuck, niggas fuck
Yeah, shake that ass ho, shake, shake
Shake that ass ho, shake, shake
Shake that ass ho, shake, shake
Shake that ass ho, shake, shake
Shake-shka-shake-shka-shake shake that ass
Shake-shka-shake-shka-shake shake that ass
Say dicksuckin' ho, nutsuckin' ho
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin' but hoes
You ain't nothin' but a dopeman bitch
You ain't nothin' but a dopeman bitch
You ain't nothin' but a dopeman bitch
You ain't got no job, now you want me to trick
But I'm a nigga with a rock hard bone
And I'm takin' one of these hoes home, yeah

And I'm takin' one of these hoes home, yeah
