15 ContributorsBall Lyrics
I pull up, hop out
Riding around with that Glock out
40 thou in my left pocket, molly, lean, in my right pocket
I'm so thrown
I'm just ridin 'round and I'm getting it
Cruising through my city serving three-five for the fifties
And I'm a gangster for real, that's why the bitch nigga it don't even speak (fuck nigga)
Put diamonds in my teeth so talking ain't cheap
Well that's just for me cause I just let the money speak
With fifty young niggas at all time, that's why I'm an OG

Okay my girl ass fat, she got me geeking round this bitch
It's money over bitches, but all my niggas want this bitch
I got one eye open, yeah I'm peeping through this bitch
Hundred deep outside the club, my niggas sneaking through this bitch
We gon' ball-ball-ball-ball-ball
That's why my niggas got this bitch packed from wall to wall
And you know they don't play, I don't even gotta say
You playin'? We gon' spray this bitch from wall to wall

Hundred deep inside the club, pack that bitch down like sardines
Everyone get major puffs, bitch you know we don't drink tea
Oh my god nigga try you luck, spray your head with this AR 'chine
Baw-bawbaw shoot your ass up, now you frigid like a ding ding
No homo, two times, no homo nigga but I'ma show a nigga
You're ho life is a game and I'm a controller nigga, ever sold a nigga?
(Laughs) Na for real, what's the deal
Either kill the shit or get killed
And I'm the shit for real like ill (pshh)
Nigga put me in let em hold on my private part
Friend that ho, I just see Gucci hand print on her body part
A hundred percent of real niggas around me, your niggas they kinda hard
But forget that, I really really like your kitty cat
But OG
You might also like
Okay my girl ass fat, she got me geeking round this bitch
It's money over bitches, but all my niggas want this bitch
I got one eye open, yeah I'm peeping through this bitch
Hundred deep outside the club, my niggas sneaking through this bitch
We gon' ball-ball-ball-ball-ball
That's why my niggas got this bitch packed from wall to wall
And you know they don't play, I don't even gotta say
You playin'? We gon' spray this bitch from wall to wall1Embed
