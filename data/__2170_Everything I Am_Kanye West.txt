Damn
Here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn (Here we go)
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

I'll never be picture-perfect, Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up? You see how I played a big
Role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am
You might also like
Damn
Here we go again
Everybody sayin' what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn (Here we go)
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So, say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

Damn
Here we go again
Bum-tu-bum-bum-bum
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
(Here we go) Damn
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today

(Here we go!) Damn
Here we go again
Everybody sayin' what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
(Here we go) Damn
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

Here we go-we go
Here we go-we go
Go-go-go again76Embed
