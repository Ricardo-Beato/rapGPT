Hella fake, you better pull up on me
I hope you feel the same when you see my face, you better pull up on me
Ain't no backin' down, prepared to shake, you better pull up on me
Now you wanna be my friend, no you ain't safe, you better pull up, homie
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up on me
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up on me
I heard you talkin' cray, I know you hella fake, you better pull up on me
I hope you feel the same when you see my face

No, I don't think they know
They don't know how this go
They think I'm broke
What a fuckin' joke
When I walk in the door, I gets my dough
Then a bitch get low
I used to kill them poles, now I kill them shows
They don't like my growth, well fuck ya hoes
Yeah, 'cause all my bitches that be gettin' with me
If I put a fifty, they gon' put a fifty
Every night, ask Sue's rendezvous
It was Kita, Sweetness, and Ashanti with me
I had to go get it on some real shit
If you a real bitch ,you gon' feel this
Every single nigga that came my way
I finesse and juug on some ill shit
So much people think they know my pussy
But no one can say they fucked
Please show me hoe facts
Name-drop, round 'em up
That bum bitch like to run her mouth
I swear to God I'ma lay her out
When I catch you on the side of town
My Guiseppe heels gonna stomp you out
I'm tired of playin', I'm tired of playin'
I'ma give you hell, you gon' think I'm Satan
I see you mad 'cause I'm 'bout to have this whole shit on lock
Incarceration
Someone gave you wrong information
You try to play me, that's confirmation
But it's all good 'cause when you see my face
Shit don't come out like it's constipation
You might also like
You stuck, bitch, yeah
I know it sucks, bitch, yeah
Pull up, bitch, yeah
Like wassup, bitch, yeah

Pull up on me
I heard you talkin' cray, I know you hella fake, you better pull up on me
I hope you feel the same when you see my face, you better pull up on me
Ain't no backin' down, prepared to shake, you better pull up on me
Now you wanna be my friend, no you ain't safe, you better pull up, homie

Let's go, I mean come on now, who you tryna flex for?
Why you actin' like I won't leave you down in the ground?
But you knew what it was from the get-go
That Cardi on some new shit
Get that money then I go flip
Some people think I'm just a dumb bitch
If that was true I wouldn't have shit, yeah
Bronx bitch 'til the day I die
I did my dirt and I ain't gotta lie
You can talk crazy on IG
But when I run up, let them hands fly
I don't fuck around with no fuckin' clowns
Any niggas with me, they fuckin' hounds
Any bitches with me, they fuckin' down
So if you really 'bout it, then pull up now
You stuck, bitch, yeah
I know it sucks, bitch, yeah
Pull up, bitch, yeah
Like wassup, bitch, yeah

Pull up on me
I heard you talkin' cray, I know you hella fake, you better pull up on me
I hope you feel the same when you see my face, you better pull up on me
Ain't no backin' down, prepared to shake, you better pull up on me
Now you wanna be my friend, no you ain't safe, you better pull up, homie6Embed
