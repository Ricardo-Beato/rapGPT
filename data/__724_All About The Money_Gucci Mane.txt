26 ContributorsAll About The Money Lyrics
I'm on my way to see my P.O
I ain't talking about probation officer
Talking about my P.O. box, they just sent me 3 million dollars
(What the fuck that mean nigga?)
All my hoes go to the beauty parlor
Bought my ma a house today
I'll buy my auntie one tomorrow
I just left the Phantom lot
I didn't do no paper work
300K, my paper work just like the New Boys "I'm a jerk "
You bring your girl your feelings hurt
Cause like R. Kelly "I'm a Flirt"
I got work like babe and them, a Geto Boy like 'Face and them
It ain't no mistaking him
Hottest boys out Drake and him
Me, Juiceman and Waka and them
Ride around with choppers, pimp
So how the hell you chop or flip you water bluffing water whimp
Theres no limit to Gucci money just ask Silkk the Shock & them

Burglar bars around the door (word)
My country boys they want some more (birds)
Early in the morning
Later in the evening
I'm all about that money man even when I'm sleeping
I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning
I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning
You might also like
All about my money, nigga, run with my monopoly
Money; my philosophy, cocaine on my property
Yeah, that bitch a stripper, but there's so much she can offer me
Gave me the connect, he send me 7 and say it's all for me
Money build my confidence
Shorty, show your competence
Before I get another bitch, cause I be on some other shit
Higher than a mothership
Louis in my seven-tre
Gucci in my other shit
Gucci, pass the other clip
Thirty rounds, them I'mma dip
I can make a Hummer flip
I can make a hundred flip-
That's one Bahamas trip
Make your mama strip
I'm bout that dead pres'
So for the bread I make you play a game of Simon Says

Burglar bars around the door (word)
My country boys they want some more (birds)
Early in the morning
Later in the evening
I'm all about that money man even when I'm sleeping
I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning
I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning
Like Batman and Robin we be flogging mobbing inside Aston Martins
Beg your pardon Gucci darling
More check than a check-o-slovin
Whats your motherfucking problem?
Ross and Gucci I'ma rob em
How you gonna rob the robbers?
These home boys got too much armor
We got so much jewelry on
We just make your vision dizzy
Give your ass a charm and watch it make your fingers pissing
Damnit boy I'm spilling Chrissy Ye
Yellow bitches blowing kisses Ricky Ross about them digits
On the stage or in the kitchen

Burglar bars around the door (word)
My country boys they want some more (birds)
Early in the morning
Later in the evening
I'm all about that money man even when I'm sleeping
I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning
I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning3Embed
