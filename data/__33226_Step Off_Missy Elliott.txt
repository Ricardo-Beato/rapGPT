6 ContributorsStep Off Lyrics
I know you're not my man
And you belong to someone else (Nah)
Now come on in, and shut the door
I'll make sure you enjoy yourself
If you give me a try, before you deny I'm still in love wit' you
Or maybe obsessed wit' you

Ow
We don't make love no more (Mm-mm)
We don't kiss and we don't hug like we used to (Used to)
But I'm still in love with you
Wait, wait a minute
Now if I drive by your house (House)
And see some bitch in your bed, under the spreads
Giving you head
Then I'm gonna turn it out (Hey)

I'm the only one who keep you satisfied
And though we're not together I remember what you like
So tell them chicks to step off 'cause I fill your appetite
And I'm the only woman who gon' do it like you like

(Hey, uh) What part don't you get? (Hey, hey)
Even though I'm not your girl anymore
And you don't want me no more (Ow)
I deserve to know who you sleepin' wit' (Ooh yeah)
Whatchu talkin' bout, Willis?
Is she better then me? (Me, me)
Do she cook? Do she clean? Do she sew? Do she steam? (Ow)
Can she do these things? 'Cause I...
You might also like
I'm the only one who keep you satisfied
And though we're not together I remember what you like
So tell them chicks to step off 'cause I fill your appetite
And I'm the only woman who gon' do it like you like

I still love ya, baby
Makes no difference to me
And I still wantcha, baby
Want to be the one you need
The one you call on (Mm-mm)
'Cause I'm the only one that make you feel good (Mm-mm)
Sing it to me

I'm the only one who keep you satisfied
And though we're not together I remember what you like
So tell them chicks to step off 'cause I fill your appetite
And I'm the only woman who gon' do it like you like
I'm the only one who keep you satisfied
And though we're not together I remember what you like
So tell them chicks to step off 'cause I fill your appetite
And I'm the only woman who gon' do it like you likeEmbed
