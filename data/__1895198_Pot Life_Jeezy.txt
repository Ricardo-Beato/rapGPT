11 ContributorsPot Life Lyrics
My wrists sick, I'm talkin' tuberculosis
I might just, just pull up on Boulevard
Top down in two yellow Porsches
My wrists sick, I'm talkin' tuberculosis
I'm Frank Mills in '05, fuck you mean? I been cocky, nigga
My wrists sick, I'm talkin' tuberculosis
I might just, just pull up on Boulevard
Top down in two yellow Porsches
Sky-Dweller, President to Daytona, my wrist got me, nigga
Frank Mills in '05, fuck you mean? I been cocky, nigga

Look, said I'm workin' my wrists and I'm workin' that...
Fuck, hear a knock at the door
Said I can't even lie, look, I wonâ€™t even lie, my heart fell on the floor
I said eject my lil' cousins, sold classic cassettes
And you know we convening
I'm clean while I'm whippin' and cleanin' that Beam
And I ain't talkin' syrup when I'm talkin' my leaded
Woke up in Neiman's, I ain't even dreamin'
Got a deal on some carb and buy some for the team
And I'm Bruce Lee, Roy, Jizzle got the gift
Made a million, off nothin' but Taylor Swift, two-story kitchen
My vision 'Break down the block', I'm on a mission
I told my jeweler, 'Put a hundred karats in the cross'
Snow hit the club like a Christian
You might also like
When I was young, nigga, I always wanted spotlight
That's (-), nigga, homie, what your pocket like?
Come through with the top off and show 'em what the top like
They might be seein' by the rap shit
But they ain't 'bout that pot life

I take that fork and go dumb, I whip my wrist 'til it's numb
I take that fork and go dumb, I can't get two out of one
I take that fork and go dumb, I work my wrist 'til it's numb
I take that fork and go dumb, I can't get two out of one

Trap down the street from the airport
Young nigga tryin' to hit the mall daily
Any given time, it'd be raw, whole neighborhood like a volcano
Either gon' rap or be a ball player, I started out from the pot life
That my definition of hard labor
Got bricks and I'm tryin' to get my shot right
Got my spot bumpin' like acne, fuck dealin', I took a Xanny
Shorty say, 'Boy, do you love me?'
I said, 'Girl, I love that C and C, that's that codeine and caffeine
Got a pantry full of bakin' soda for the whip
Take two zips out of every brick
Twenty-five times, hit the dealership
Tryin' to make a livin' sellin' that killer shit
If a bitch with me, then it is a benefit
Uh, nine-to-five, ten 'til six, work
Tryin' to whip my wrists until it hurt
I don't sip syrup unless it purp, fuck around and get murked
Nigga, don't fuck around and get murked
Shoot your ass from the corner like dirt
(-) handle work like it's light work
When I was young, nigga, I always wanted spotlight
That's (-), nigga, homie, what your pocket like?
Come through with the top off and show 'em what the top like
They might be seein' by the rap shit
But they ain't 'bout that pot life

I take that fork and go dumb, I whip my wrist 'til it's numb
I take that fork and go dumb, I can't get two out of one
I take that fork and go dumb, I work my wrist 'til it's numb
I take that fork and go dumb, I can't get two out of one1Embed
