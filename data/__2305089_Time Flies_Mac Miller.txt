50 ContributorsTime Flies Lyrics
Time flies, time flies
As we keep livin' and as we keep bein' positive
All we can do is hold onto these memories (Yeah)
Mac Miller, I love you

All of my homies used to get on my case like, "When you 'bout to kill 'em?"
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprout some children
But I've been murderin' the game, I'm almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half-man and half-amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man
My mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get, that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram, goddamn

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...
You might also like
(Time flies)
Watch as time go
(Time flies)
Time moves, time flows
(Try to catch it, time flies)
How do we handle these things?
(Time flies, try to catch it)
I am time, we are time and we have control
One thing we need to remember
Is that we are all in this together

Yeah
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams I manifested
From my head into reality, they seem a bit excessive, but
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with a ego big as Texas
Thinkin', "I'm the man"
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk the path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit, I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone
On the road, even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control
From a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own
Punches like this prolly beat up Stallone
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride (Yeah)
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...

(Time flies)
One day, we will
(Time flies)
We will find
(Try to catch it, time flies)
We will conquer, conquer with love
(Time flies, try to catch it)
While time is on our side
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories
They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on
