9 ContributorsYou Know What It Is (Mr. Zone 6) Lyrics
(I'm back up in these streets, nigga, you know what the fuck it is)
'Cause Gucci Mane Laflare one hood ass nigga
I'm tatted up, dreads shaking, you know what the fuck it is
Waka Flocka Flame one hood ass nigga
You know, you know, you know, you know what it is
'Cause Gucci Mane Laflare one hood ass nigga
(Gucci, Gucci, Mane, nigga), Waka Flocka Flame, nigga
(Don't act like you don't know my mothafuckin' name, nigga)

My swag sick, so I sneeze on a ho
I'm a Rich Boy, I might throw some Ds on a ho
Never seen one of these, I'm not one of them wannabes
This ain't where you wanna be, then she can leave, beat your feet
On every beat I go honey-baked ham, I'm a beast
If it's beef, leave you shiftless, laying on the street
Is it hot in this mothafuckin' booth or is it me?
Me and Jazze Pha go way back like Jazz and T
Smoking weed in a leaf, bitches sweat me like I'm Keith
There's a very strong smell coming out the VIP
I'ma do it for the hood, I'm a product of the streets
We gon' put you up on game, all on the count of three

(I'm back up in these streets, nigga, you know what the fuck it is)
'Cause Gucci Mane Laflare one hood ass nigga
I'm tatted up, dreads shaking, you know what the fuck it is
Waka Flocka Flame one hood ass nigga
You know, you know, you know, you know what it is
'Cause Gucci Mane Laflare one hood ass nigga
(Gucci, Gucci, Mane, nigga), Waka Flocka Flame, nigga
(Don't act like you don't know my mothafuckin' name, nigga)

Shaking trees(?), she perceives, she might end up in too deep
Give it to her so good, have her coming in her sleep
Take a TwitPic of Gucci dick and send it as a Tweet
Ever since she met me, say them niggas obsolete
I'm buying cars I don't really need, race 'em down the street
Got a Fleet, I can't bring one out, I drive 'em by the three
In a league of my own, he don't own a pair of cleats
I'm a freak on Patron, don't sit your girlfriend next to G
He say he go as hard as me, tell him that I wanna see
Do six months, then get out and spend 2 million in a week
My seed gon' never want for nothing & I put that on my niece
I'm a hustler, guess it runs all through my family tree

(I'm back up in these streets, nigga, you know what the fuck it is)
'Cause Gucci Mane Laflare one hood ass nigga
I'm tatted up, dreads shaking, you know what the fuck it is
Waka Flocka Flame one hood ass nigga
You know, you know, you know, you know what it is
'Cause Gucci Mane Laflare one hood ass nigga
(Gucci, Gucci, Mane, nigga), Waka Flocka Flame, nigga
(Don't act like you don't know my mothafuckin' name, nigga)

Let me hop back on the set with this brand new single
Million dollar niggas still riding in a Regal
Hood ass young nigga, I got more stripes than a bengal
Shawty pulling slick shit, me and him not equal
Heard that boy not eating so Flocka just might feed you
Two Hundred V my hypeman, now that's a good price, man
Gucci, that's my right hand, two ounces in my Sprite can
AKA the Light Man, they call me Waka Flocka
Told my man Guwop I'ma make him a quarter-mil
Broke before these record deals, I'm just trying to keep it real
These rap niggas flopping, on the low these niggas stopping
Sexual Healing on your girl like I'm MarvinEmbed
