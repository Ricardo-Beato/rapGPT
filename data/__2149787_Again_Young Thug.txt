Nigga, turn up
It's Guwop
Trap house (Thugger), bunkin'
Trap house mansion
Yeah, right on Flat Shoals Exit, nigga
We got London on da Track
I'm pourin' fours and shit, I need to just put a deuce in (Drank)
Car cost four-hundred-thou' and I put a roof in
My nigga pot cook it so good, he put his shoe in it
Nigga, it's a gangster party, why fuck is you in it? (Nigga)
Head buster, microwave shit, didn't take him two minutes
You know that there's some straps in the club, they let my crew in (Squad)
I might just do the Michael Vick, man, and cook it left hand
If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man (Shh)
I can make the dope do numbers, the Stacey Augmon
I told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rodman
If Gucci Mane got so much money then why he robbin'?
We thirty deep, we cover the streets, nigga, we mobbin' (Yeah)

(It's Guwop), again
Thugger and Guwop, again
Chasin' that guap, again
That my lil' whoadie, again
We chasin' that money baby, again
We fuckin' your homie's baby, again
Pay if you owe me, baby, go and show me, baby
Pull up and pour it
I'ma go gold and you know it
I got gold on my Rollie (Woo)
And I'm real right like a poet
I look like a dope boy, I know it (Woo)
I know I'ma win it like Floyd (Woo)
I became an important lil' boy (Woo)
Money long like a sock with some shorts (Slatt)
You might also like
My bitch white and she brown like a port
Ed-umacation abort
Bookin' these dorks
I jumped off the porch and went north (Slatt)
Whipped you some dope for the narcotics (Yeah)
YSL hardbody
I got 'bout twenty chickens in the lobby, baby
Ride it, ride it, Kawasaki, 'saki
I don't speak english (Nah)
I fuck that mouth on the 6's
I'm the big homie, I'm leakin'
Stick to the streets like I'm cement
I'on need no change, you can keep it
I'on want your verse on my remix
No panties, she my secret
Got a hunnid bands on me, I'm cheesin'
Beanie Sigel, lookin' down like an eagle

(It's Guwop), again
Thugger and Guwop, again
Chasin' that guap, again
That my lil' whoadie, again
We chasin' that money baby, again
We fuckin' your homie's baby, again
Pay if you owe me baby, go and show me, baby
Pull up and pour it
I'ma go gold and you know it
I got gold on my Rollie
And I'm real right like a poet (Slatt)
I look like a dope boy, I know it (Woo)
I know I'ma win it like Floyd (I win)
I became an important lil' boy (Became)
Money long like a sock with some shorts (Woo, woo)
Whippin' that bitch
She whip out that dick
She suckin', damn, she fuckin', damn
Sittin' a band on her knees like a bucket, damn, yeah64Embed
