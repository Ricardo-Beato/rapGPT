Nigga smokin' that's wassup
Me and eight guns like Squidward
Nigga smokin', that's wassup
It's me and eight
I got eight arms like Squidward
It's me and eight guns like Squidward
I got eight arms like Squidward
I might shoot you
I got eight guns like Squidward
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Eight guns like Squidward
Eight guns like Squidward
Eight guns like Squidward
Bao-bao, bao-bao
Eight guns like
Duh-da-duh, duh-da-duh
Eight guns like
Eight guns like
Duh-da-duh, duh-da-duh
Eight guns like

It's me and eight guns like Squidward, bao-bao
You can't beat or join the Glo, bow down
Hey I'll come get ya, bao-bao
AK that's my nigga, shoot off five rounds
These poles'll leave 'em lost, the poles'll leave 'em lost
This bitch gave me jaw like her damn teeth went lost
Her nigga lookin' for her, he think that she went lost, aye
Almighty Sosa leave 'em lost, bang
You might also like
What Almighty gon' do next? Aye, aye
Who Almighty gon' shoot next? Aye, aye
Where Almighty gon' move next? Aye, aye
A condo or a mansion?
Forensics come through, cleanin shit up Spongebob
Cause four niggas came through we gon' call them gun cars
I've been gang banging since a young boy
Now I'm richer than a drug lord, aye
Still ride with guns boy
Still put X on my tongue boy
Still doin' what the fuck I want boy
Hit on me right on boy
For these nice shoes I paid a price, aye, aye
Spill somethin' on 'em, I'ma take your life, aye, aye
In the club and I got my pipe
No security I got my guys, aye, aye

It's me and eight guns like Squidward, bao-bao
You can't beat or join the Glo, bow down
Hey I'll come get ya, bao-bao
AK that's my nigga, shoot off five rounds
These poles'll leave 'em lost, the poles'll leave 'em lost
This bitch gave me jaw like her damn teeth went lost
Her nigga lookin' for her, he think that she went lost, aye
Almighty Sosa leave 'em lost, bang4Embed
