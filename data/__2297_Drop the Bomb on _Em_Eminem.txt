108 ContributorsDrop the Bomb on â€™Em Lyrics
Yeah, boy
Dem better ring the alarm, boy
Dem know what's comin', boy
Buck! Buck! Buck! Haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh my God, fuckin' bomboclaat
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothing but a bra, boy
I'm the real deal, and charbroil her on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch, I'm like Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
'Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' fictitional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact, boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly-By-The-Seat-Of-His-Pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearin' zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no, nada
Like your father fuckin' your mother

Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

Boy, I'm the Real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the Rap Crown Royals
Who scalp cowboys, now, how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
Of whip-ass on ya, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God, boy, you didn't go there, no, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got, whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin', ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot when the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop and when it does, boy, there's a problem
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, singin' telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By sayin' Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady-fuckin'-Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me37Embed
