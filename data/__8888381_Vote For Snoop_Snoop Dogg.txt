2 ContributorsVote For Snoop Lyrics
A vote to you
Yo, what up? This is Big Snoop
If you can
And Marvin Gaye
Pull the country through
And I'm runnin' for president
You're the man
Believe it

You've been talkin', talkin' to the people
Tryin' to get 'em to go your way
Tellin' us not to worry
You say we won't be led astray
So blind from signifyin'
Your opponents, followin' 'em all with lies
Oh, think about the mistakes you made
I believe America's at stake
Bustin', bustin' is an issue
Come on, let me hear your plan, mister
'Cause, if you've got a plan
If you've got a master plan

I got to vote for you (Vote for me)
I got to vote for Snoop
You're the man (Snoop Dogg)
You might also like
That's what I'ma do, Marvin, I'm gunnin' for it
The presidential candidate, I'm runnin' for it
See, 'cause I'm tired of these folks leavin' us broke
It's a joke, until you get up, get out and vote
You see, these laws was made to bring you down
But vote for me, and I'ma turn this thing around
See, I'm the closest thing to Clinton, did I mention?
I blow the sax and I love gettin' waxed in the kitchen
Keepin' my balls up, the oval office
What we use for negotiatin' and bargainin'
The target is to get this thing crackin'
They got a black man in the white house
Marvin, turn the lights out

Yeah, Big Snoop Dogg runnin' for president
Somebody gotta change the world, real talk
Marvin Gaye
I wanna thank you for gettin' down with me on this record right here
I'ma let you gon' get back to where you was at
May your soul rest in peace
We gon' make a difference out here, yeah
All this black on black crime, it's gotta stop
All of this negative and this nonsense, it's gotta stop
It's time for us to wake up
It could be a better place, it's all about how you do it
Vote for me, Big Snoop Dogg, preachEmbed
