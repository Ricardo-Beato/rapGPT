27 ContributorsWalking in the Rain Lyrics
Dear God, watch over me
Watch over mommy, watch over daddy
Watch over all God's children, amen

Huh, walkin' in the rain
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Huh, walkin' in the, rrr

Look here, I grew up with the thing, hard living (Uh-huh)
Found out the source of the pain, God given (Ooh)
He left me with no shelter in the rain
But I learned to stay dry, so it wasn't in vain
Every time you go through somethin', there's somethin' to gain
And you only truly suffer if you remain the same (Come on)
Let the dirt you go through change you (What?)
Don't forget, еven Satan was an angel
You can't go through life walkin' blind
Gotta not only spеak your heart but talk your mind (Uh)
One thing lead to another (Yeah)
How I get down is I will bleed for my brother (What?)
Man, I'm a different nigga (Man)
I'ma say it once (Please stop) all that riffin', nigga (Woo)
For the sake of all the people that love you, I'm a goon (Man)
Leave your family in the park lettin' go of balloons
We miss you
You might also like
I don't always get my share of roses
For me, sunny days are always comin', goin'
I know we all got our share of trials and tribulations, yeah
But I done rode for some of y'all
When you ain't even have a ride yourself
So tell me why I'm walkin', walkin', walkin'?

Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the, rrr (Walkin')

We in the new dark ages
We reject who we really are, adaptation
Accept no cheap imitations
I am the streets meet civilization, police precinct 114 chased him
Who should be held accountable
For the hell I encountered just explorin' the town I knew?
You pray a predator choose, I fared better than many
Y'all fear some career gun-slangin' youngsters
Coulda went to war, probably wouldn't have overcome it
I coulda been still bitter now, 'cause there's no middle ground
Locked up juveniles make grown men doubt
Made me wanna get myself knocked in jail just to get you inside
Can't even wait 'til you get out to air you out
As a teen, it's just a few things I cared about
Facts, I made it, impact behavior like the eternal flame
In Martin Luther's grave, yeah, gotta keep burnin', unabated
Turn a man to a millionaire
Just to tell you how good that my day went
My life should be an Ava DuVernay flick
Denzel plays a younger Nas with some CGI
If you rock with your day ones, bless
If you do not, don't let it stress
There's friends I only see once a year
Nothing changed, love is there
Some brothers you outgrow, you leave 'em there, yeah
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the, rrr
Walkin', walkin', walkin'

Walkin' in the rain
Walkin' in the rain
Walkin' in the rain
Walkin' in the rain3Embed
