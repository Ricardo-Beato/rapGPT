45 ContributorsStill Got That Rock Lyrics
Nigga I be hard on a ho 'cause a bitch ain't shit
And every ho I done fucked done sucked my dick
I had to pour out some drank for niggas I miss
I hope my weed ain't too loud to hear the snakes hiss
It's Dedication 5, medication high
I gotta clean up after these niggas 'cause they be wasting time
And boy, my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line
I'm shining on these hoes so hard they getting tan lines
It's Tunechi, I go hard, I put in work
Twin Glocks, the gift and the curse
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt
We geeked up, the revenge of the nerds
I swear, play with these niggas, that's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food
I got the power, but a short fuse, let's go
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the Feds
You know snitches get stitches, nigga, needle and thread
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't too proud to beg
Alright, fucking right, shoot you up at the light
Straight take all your possessions, call that shit Poltergeist
And my homie, he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes
I call my bitch Plane Jane 'cause she catch nut like a flight
I'm on a mission to get movie money, stick to the script
Your bitch leaking information, I just follow the drip
Soon as I get that coupe, I'mma go get the rims
Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his
I feel like He-Man when I'm in your ho
And tell that bitch give me my space, like a telescope
In her throat like Ricola, my system solar
I'm too young to die sober, your man a cobra
Watch that nigga, let's go
Boy, my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians
Straight blowing money fast, I'mma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper, I'mma smack a nigga
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket, flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's telling jokes
I swear to God, I put in work
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert
I spit these bars, this a uni-verse
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke
I'm telling ya, shout out Turk
It's Hot Boys, bitch, the block is hot
If I ain't have the keys to success I would have picked the lock
Diarrhea, shit don't stop, until my fucking casket drop
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'mma pass the rock
