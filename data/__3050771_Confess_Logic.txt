89 ContributorsConfess Lyrics
I want what I want how I want when I want it
I’ma keep it a hunnid, I’m blunted
I don’t give a damn, I don’t give a fuck about another man
Fuck a brother man
I’ma make it, make it rain like the weather man
Old girl shoulda, shoulda got a better man
Ass fat, lookin' good in my letterman
In the hood I’m a better man
Wish a mothafucka would, would
Whole life I been up to no good
Change it all if I could
Rearrange my heart, the beat good but I can’t
I’m a sinner, not a saint
Layers to my life, no I can’t
Cover it up with paint
Keep on livin', livin'
Livin' on money and women
As soon as I’m in 'em, I’m out
Now the truth never come out my mouth
Speak life when I come in her mouth, like

I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life, a waste of skin
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don’t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
You might also like
Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

I’d rather be a different man in another world
Than work for the man in my universe
Wonder what it feel like to take flight
Momma told me everything gon' be alright
I mean my life can’t be off right
But come to think about it
Everybody runnin' the world seem to be all white
Can you mothafuckas see alright?
I mean, I need it, I want it, I gotta have it
Every day tragic
If you’re from where I’m from, everyday ain’t magic
On this I know
I been telling everybody I’ma give it a go, I know
I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know!
Love it or hate it, I made it
I did it, I lived it
While the whole world lookin' at the boy like whoa!
Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey
Really wonder what the remedy
Tell me, how the world gon' remember me?
Got me feelin like the enemy
Like I ain’t got no energy
I been lookin' for an entity
Feelin' like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity
Fuck all that
I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life
A waste of skin
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don’t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now

Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

I know my life was lived the wrong way
I know I did you wrong in my own way
But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized
That hypnotized the only
Part of me you loved
Part of me that had the strength to rise above
Part of me you know
Part of me you love more than to let it go
Dear God, I just wanna know why
Why do you put us here?
Why do you put us below?
Why do you put us subservient?
Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers?
And then we crawl and we scratch our way out
We betray each other
We lie, we take from one another
And we told you gon' forgive us at the end
But the state don't forgive us
I'm locked up and half my friends
And then when I get out, or I make it out
I'm expected to somehow give back
To people who never wanted to see me escape
I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror
And it's gettin' clearer
That society was designed to keep me on the bottom
So, if you real, if you're out there for real
Please explain to me why
Why do we suffer? Why do we die?
And why do the people
Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead?
I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right
But tonight, I am in this church
Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me
Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do
So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down
I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up
I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame
And all I wanna do is believe in you
The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt
And they make sure it hurts
And I am tired of hurtin', man
I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared
So if you out there, do something about this
'Cause I can't take it no more
