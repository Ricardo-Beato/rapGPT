7 ContributorsCode We Honor Lyrics
The code we honor, fuck your honor
I pledge allegiance to Benjamin Franklin
A flock of  rule the nation
From rags to riches, that's my destination
The code we honor, fuck your honor
I pledge allegiance to Benjamin Franklin
A flock of  rule the nation
From rags to riches, that's my destination, final destination

One nation earn the mula, fetty
You can keep the cameras rollin', I don't need no edit
We give back to the streets, but won't take no payment
Say once you unleash a beast, a lotta blood gettin' shed
Spill the ammunition on the ice when I wear it
Drape like a crystal ball over a thousand of carats
Feel like a billionaire boy, take my cup in Paris
On the flight, thinkin' 'bout them long nights servin' K
Cross my heart, hope to die, in the sky, livin' legend
Granted me the gift to God, I'ma do it with a passion
Over two hunnid on the dash, bitch, catch me when I'm passin'
I grab the cup 

The code we honor, fuck your honor
I pledge allegiance to Benjamin Franklin
A flock of  rule the nation
From rags to riches, that's my destination
The code we honor, fuck your honor
I pledge allegiance to Benjamin Franklin
A flock of  rule the nation
From rags to riches, that's my destination, final destination

Ain't got nothin' to prove, everything for sale
I been the fuckin' fool, and I'm well prepared
We got lots of paper, we don't want no friends
Keep my circle tight, I don't want you in
Roll the credits, dawg, we the main stars
All the times you looked down, look up, we done came far
Ain't no  team, I'm with my same squad
Cheated a million times, I'm with my same broad
See, I ain't take her virginity, but I took her heart
See, I'm in love with money, we'll will never go out
We just some niggas together when times became hard
They murdered Hard Nard, my heart forever scarred

The code we honor, fuck your honor
I pledge allegiance to Benjamin Franklin
A flock of  rule the nation
From rags to riches, that's my destination
The code we honor, fuck your honor
I pledge allegiance to Benjamin Franklin
A flock of  rule the nation
From rags to riches, that's my destination, final destination

My cousin on parol
I'm constantly on the road
Get twenty thousand for a walk through
Gettin' paid for Molly and gold
Enough slang I could write me a dictionary
My combo is extraordinary
We speakin' and they call us legendary
Let my thoughts free, evolutionary
Won't break my silence, I go out ridin'
We international, my G, I can't even hide it
We'll never touch the ground no more, I promise I'm the flyest
They can't deny it, I'm bigger than Goliath
My empire, hard times expired
My attire, rap style
Body covered up in VVS's, feel baptized
My lifestyle is extravagant, I ain't never satisfied
Saint Woo found his appeal, and I hope he just defy it
The code we honor, fuck your honor
I pledge allegiance to Benjamin Franklin
A flock of  rule the nation
From rags to riches, that's my destination
The code we honor, fuck your honor
I pledge allegiance to Benjamin Franklin
A flock of  rule the nation
From rags to riches, that's my destination, final destinationEmbed
