6 ContributorsDevils in My Section Lyrics
(Zaytoven)
This is not a diss, it's just the truth
Wop
Go

Middle of November (Burr), it ain't even December (Burr)
Nigga brought my name up, I guess they don't remember (Burr)
Avondale to Candler, Bouldercrest to Allen Temple (Huh?)
You play with Gucci Mane, I'm sendin' your ass to Donald Trimble (Damn)
I can still remember (Yeah), I popped him like a pimple (Ooh)
I read the autopsy, bullets went straight through his dimple (Pew, pew)
My gunners, they got gunnеrs, my runners, they got runners
I'm low-ballin' thе number when I front 'em, please don't fumble (Skrrt)
They say I was too thugged out, wouldn't let me meet Obama ('Bama)
The judge said I'm a problem sittin' right in front my mama (Mama)
I'm thinkin' to myself, "What would you have done, your honor?"(Honor)
Pistol whip that bitch who set me up out her pajamas (Bitch)
Fuckin' mulignanes tried to test Gucci cajones (Mulignan)
Last thing I heard that in the woods, that's a rumor
See, I'm the type that pull up two deep in a rental (Skrrt)
Who wanna go to hell? 'Cause Gucci tryna send you
It's a lot of demons in my section, please remember (Yeah)
If you ain't bustin' fire, then you can't be a member (Go)
It's a lot of devils in my section, please remember
If you ain't got no bodies, then you can't be a member (Wop)You might also likeEmbed
