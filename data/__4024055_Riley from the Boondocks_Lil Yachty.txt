35 ContributorsRiley from the Boondocks Lyrics
Mhm, moonwalk, beat like a boom box (Beat)
With the shits like I'm Riley from The Boondocks
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
With lil' bro on the block, he got two Glocks
All he rock is track suits and Nike Shox
And Maybach Mitch on the beat too, bitch
Lousy

Ooh, bitch, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, bitch, Ike Turner the beat
600 degrees
Baby just want a degree
I'ma pay all of the fees
Yup, told her, "We need more like you"
Really need less like me
I'ma Slimeball like Nudy
I slang wood like Judy
488, red ruby
Wait, I cannot fuck with the Jakes
Hmm, unless it's TD
Slide on yo bitch like a CD
Rarely seen, when I am, it's a Kodak
You niggas snitchin', I already know that
Make a decision by makin' decision
These niggas be switchin', I'ma have to cut 'em
But touch my umbrella
We can't be related 'cause I'm a go-getter
And he's just too lazy, the Glock got the laser
The pump got the laser, the Uzi, a laser
The AR, a laser, I'm strapped, don't do tasers
Yeah, turn you to a tater
Just got an AP and stomp out like the Raiders
I prayed to be best, I'm like crackin' away from
I'm cool with my neighbors, they plot with the mayors
I can't get in trouble
I only back down if I'm shootin', I double
She ride on the dick like the bike with the muffle (nyoom)
I said I had one, but I keep me a couple
I can't do no scuffle (huh?)

Mhm, moonwalk, beat like a boom box (Beat)
With the shits like I'm Riley from The Boondocks
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
With lil' bro on the block, he got two Glocks
All he rock is track suits and Nike Shox
Mhm, moonwalk, beat like a boom box (Beat)
With the shits like I'm Riley from The Boondocks
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
With lil' bro on the block, he got two Glocks
All he rock is track suits and Nike Shox

Hmm, shit, I got Nike money (Checks)
Signed with QC and started actin' funny
Changed my number five times since you've had it, dummy
I'm outside, it's V-Live, come and press it, dummy (Damn)
I ain't givin' clout (Nope), I ain't givin' clout (Nope)
Lick that pussy 'til it's squirtin' like a sprinkler spout
Fuck her once, then I took her to the In-N-Out
Bitch, I'm all about the gang, ain't no signin' out
Yeah, we vibin' out, and they ridin' out
Bet you say the wrong thing, then we wildin' out
Don't you get it? Aim it at your fitted
This ain't New Edition, VVS' glisten
I was raised by the loaders, they don't ever listen
Disrespect boys, then we X boys
Mhm, moonwalk, beat like a boom box (Beat)
With the shits like I'm Riley from The Boondocks
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
With lil' bro on the block, he got two Glocks
All he rock is track suits (And what?) and Nike Shox
Mhm, moonwalk, beat like a boom box (Beat)
With the shits like I'm Riley from The Boondocks
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
With lil' bro on the block, he got two Glocks
All he rock is track suits (And what?) and Nike Shox3Embed
