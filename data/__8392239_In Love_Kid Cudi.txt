Hmm

Never have I seen someone so pretty, wow
It's pretty wild, crazy
Caught me lookin', such a vision, oh, so pretty, wow
It's pretty wild, crazy
You look at me, hope you can't see, no
As my heart beats, I'm the lonely man
The lonely man, baby

Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm (N.A.)
Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm (N.A.)
Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm (N.A.)
Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Rollin' through my days and all my nights
Speedin' by, hoping I don't hit the walls
There she stands and we share a stare
She is all I've been wantin', y'all
I can't explain what I'm feelin', so
I will wait and I'll wait for you
I will wait and I'll wait for you, ooh-ooh

In love (Now I know, now I know there's a truth, I can't hide)
In love (Can't believe what I'm seeing, unreal to my eyes)
In love (And you find me, I find you, whatevеr the life)
In love (Ayy, ayy)

You swim all through my mind
Just givе me one more sign
Flyin' with me through the clouds, we go sky-high
Take my hand and close your eyes and take the ride, ride

Rollin' through my days and all my nights
Speedin' by, hoping I don't hit the walls
There she stands and we share a stare
She is all I've been wantin', y'all
I can't explain what I'm feelin', so
I will wait and I'll wait for you
