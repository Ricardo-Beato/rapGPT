5 ContributorsStill Donâ€™t Kno Lyrics
I'm from GA where the feds will follow ya
And the streets will swallow ya, and it's
So many bricks that you could build a mansion
With the guest house and the room for expansion
12 rooms, 8 baths, don't make me laugh
12 rounds on my hip, don't make me blast
It ain't no secret, hoes is about it
Was flippin' that soft white before I ever became famous
A few tried, but they shall remain nameless
Lunar eclipse, they tryna block my shine
Say what the fuck you want, can't stop my grind
1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 4
What the hell, maybe it's 12
So listen, lil mane, this before the rap game
Before 'em videos, before all 'em shows
Look at me now nigga, I rock my own clothes
Mold my bitches, yeah I make my own hoes

I'm from GA where the feds will follow ya
And the streets will swallow ya, and it's
So many bricks that you could build a mansion
With the guest house and the room for expansion
Nigga please, I make money when I'm sleep
5 bricks on my lap, 100 thousand dollar nap
New Desert Eag, that's a thousand dollar strap
They say I can't rap, better smoke another blunt
I see ya when I see ya, I be in London for a month
You niggas bench riders, we know you won't play
2 shows a day even In the UK
I hear you niggas talkin', but I ain't listenin'
My neck got jealous of my wrist again
You know me, I still do it for the hood
But when them niggas came up, them niggas changed up
You know me, still the same ole G
Got the Rari in the trap, 40 ounce of Old E
62's like pancakes, the waffle house
When it comes to snowman, you better watch ya mouth
And ya back and ya front, shit's real, you better guard ya grill
Two 40 cals plus them choppas
You can call the ambulance, minus the doctors
Matter fact, nigga, hold ya breath
Go get ya pistol out ya car, nigga, kill yourself WHAT?!You might also like2Embed
