3 ContributorsLonely Lyrics
Don't be surprised, when you see me 'round town
Walking around, with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised, if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man, who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely

On this cold pavement, I feel like laying
In the middle of the street, and just saying
I can't take it, I won't make it
Too much weight on my shoulders, and my kids are getting older
For so long, I've been so strong
I've been crying all week since you've been gone
And as the tears roll out my eyes
Another happy young couples walks by

Don't be surprised, when you see me 'round town
Walking around, with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised, if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man, who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
You might also like
Someone been sleeping in my bed, eating my food
Using my soap, laying up in my pool
Walking around in his boxers, like every thing's cool
Gassing my chick for the whip, dropping her off at school
Under my covers and changing my channels
Playing my CD's in my robes, another man's burning my candles
My cologne's half way gone, a fake don, my wiz fell for
Now she strolls the park under his arm
This is my fault, I've never thought I'd see this coming
From the outside bugging, with crazy knots in my stomach
Say what goes around, comes around, now I know it now
Now I'm the fool looking in while it's going down
If somebody would of told me, I might be lonely
Now it's on me, baby call me please

Don't be surprised, when you see me 'round town
Walking around, with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised, if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man, who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely

Now he's getting all my kisses, stroking my loving
That 'posed to be me, but I was too stupid and stubborn
Like a piece of rope, I let it go, my mother said it so
You better straighten up, don't act like you didn't know
Her birthday came, heard she was hugged up, wearing his chain
Play in the sky box, at some bullshit Knick game
My son said, daddy, he like his eggs well done
And he kinda cool, mommy happy, I can't front
He take us on trips and clothes shopping, most of the time
We watch flicks on your surround sound, he watch boxing
You better go beg or something, before she go love him
He's taking your spot, cuz you was dissing mommy, you bugging
They don't argue, he sent her flowers for no reason
She's cheesing, I'm wishing you could come back and see this
Don't be surprised, when you see me 'round town
Walking around, with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised, if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man, who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonelyEmbed
