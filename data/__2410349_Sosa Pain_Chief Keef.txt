16 ContributorsSosa Pain Lyrics
DathanBeatz
Flowing on these beats
Now that I'm Sosa baby, you wanna have my baby
Bitch, is you crazy? You ain't know me before they payed me
(Glo Gang) Now that I'm Sosa baby, you wanna have my baby
Sosa baby, have my baby
Tutu and Aiki
And Fathead, Junebug
Ayy

Bitch, I'm smoking on these trees, flowing on these beats
She like, "Sosa don't be mean, can I see yo car keys?"
Bitch, is you crazy? You ain't know me before they payed me
Now that I'm Sosa baby, you wanna have my baby
Beamer, Bentleys, and Mercedes
Dada, that's how Kay Kay be
Blat blat, that's how AK be
I'm just getting off these drugs with my thing off safety

Getting off these drugs and I got my gat, bitch
See a opp, shit still gon' get hectic
They like Sosa on that new shit
Nah, Sosa on that next shit
Why niggas on that old shit?
Niggas rapping like the old me
Thought that I ain't know, bitch
But I don't give no shit
'Cause I'm with Glo, bitch
And you know we smoking
And you know we toting
See yo brick bitch ass, you know we blowing
You might also like
Bitch, I'm smoking on these trees, flowing on these beats
She like, "Sosa don't be mean, can I see yo car keys?"
Bitch, is you crazy? You ain't know me before they payed me
Now that I'm Sosa baby, you wanna have my baby
Beamer, Bentleys, and Mercedes
Dada, that's how Kay Kay be
Blat blat, that's how AK be
I'm just getting off these drugs with my thing off safety1Embed
