20 ContributorsFrowny Face Lyrics
Homie just texted me
Say my nigga flexed him
Dummy brick-frowny face
Rabbit food-frowny face
Say he wanna face me
Tell em "Come and skraighten me":
SK-frowny face
AK-frowny face

Some niggas tried to wet me up
Shot up my truck in East Atlanta
Want to set me up
Bbecause I tricked this nigga in Savannah
They put some money on my head
I had to move to Alabama
Started poppin' with my cousin
Mixing 'caine with Arm & Hammer
Somebody blooded my face badly
My last visit to the slammer
But they put me in that hole
Because I beat him like a hammer
The shooter shot my nigga Juice
A couple times over by Gresham
Wish I was there just to help him
He pushed on, so I respect him
Before the fortune and the fame
Deep in the game, me and my gang
Behind my rights to getting my record
They tried to murk me for my chain
Two tear drops under my eye
Because I wish some days I could cry
But to lose my self-respect
My nigga, I would rather die. Gucci!

Homie just texted me
Say my nigga flexed him
Dummy brick-frowny face
Rabbit food-frowny face
Say he wanna face me
Tell em "Come and skraighten me":
SK-frowny face
AK-frowny face

My former label didn't trick me
They just did what was expected
I was self-sufficient before
I went independent selling records
I know they're kick theyself in the ass
I'm playing chess, they playing checkers
And they know as well as I
I eat they whole roster for breakfast
I'm a bouldercrest professor
You should sign up this semester
That made me laugh cause I'm the king
I cut your head off like the jester
I'm standing tall as Manute Bol
And y'all niggas shorter then Buster
I'm the dopeman, y'all the workers
So I feed y'all with the extras
Like Drake, Trey Songz and Wayne
I just wanna be successful
Successfully keeping my cool
In situations highly stressful
I'm Gucci, all about the zeros
Comma, number and the decimal
So if you looking for a visit to the morgue
Then I can help you
Homie just texted me
Say my nigga flexed him
Dummy brick-frowny face
Rabbit food-frowny face
Say he wanna face me
Tell em "Come and skraighten me":
SK-frowny face
AK-frowny face

Sitting here on the corner
Pumping crack and marijuana
You can try me if you wanna
But I promise you'll be a goner
My rep just won't let you do that
I tote two straps, thought you knew that
If you come between my crew's stacks (Bricksquad!)
I'll lay you flat like a doormat. Gucci!Embed
