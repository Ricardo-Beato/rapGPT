5 ContributorsTaking The Train LyricsGooooood mornin', good mornin', good mornin' everybody
Yea, e'erybody's lookin' good this mornin'
Today's gonna be another good day, so let's go get 'em

Ego trip, ego trip
We be takin' the train to the ego trip
Ego trip, ego trip
We takin' the train to the ego trip

Yep, yep big trucker man is rollin' in town
How ya do, how ya do?
I got the joints to make ya...(JUMP!)
Because we headin' eastbound
Tired of the merry go round and around
And everybody's talkin' bout yo, so funny
But they still tellin' lies to me
I got the trees in my backyard
And it's hard for them to tell a lie to me
And who's the foot, when I'm the foot, now you say it
Now who's gon' say it? You know what I'm sayin'?
Skirts play with it cause I'm slick like that
I think they sayin' y'all the greatest
If I'm the greatest, well gimme gimme mine
Cause I'm heavy when I weigh it
Now watch the way I say it (ego trip)
Change my pitch, smack my bitch, I never did it
The flavor's bein' butter but brothers ain't gettin' it
Get it; or else you're a goner
When I rolls over ya gonna have to wanna
Chill, cause it's the chattanooga champ
We takin' the train, we takin' the train

Well I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Yo, I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
I be the better brand, superman
I run blocks with my circle we be nubian
I got platinum rust, never ever fuss
Ey yo, Maseo, he down with us
People stop takin' his stylin' for a joke
Don't sassafrass I put foots up the ass
Sometimes I'm fast, I blow off like a seal
Hey hey, for real
Mase chopped the record down to the bone
And now Renee King is on my cellular phone
So we talkin' autographs, years and laughs
Champagne, caviar and bubble bath
Yo see uh, that's the life that I lead
I got halos on tilt with the wings of speed
Cause I'm so fly

And yes on and on
I'm in it like a river so don't you rock my yachts yo
We got them Gills like Johnny
And sail those seven seas (we good for ya)
We bigger than bigs so dig it (you better dig it)
With waves that amazes popes
I am the is equals is cause it's caught up
When the tides taught me the ropes
Ain't no weights for the bass (man I'll give you four)
And we're the verb unheard, you better gimme one more
I ask you you got it if you're special
With a dapper toe tapper when a lot's goin' on
Hey, the answer to the riddle is me and here's the question
Who can be, and who can be, and who can be...
