Okay, I'm ready

Breathe in (Woo), breathe in (Woo), breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast, slow down
Breathe in (Woo), breathe in (Woo), breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast, slow down

Four, four (Ayy), four (Four, four, four, four), four (Ayy, ayy)
Four, four (Ayy), four (Four, four, four, four), four (Ayy, ayy)
Million on me, JAY-Z (JAY-Z, slime)
Count up, fuck nigga, pay me

Pull up, walk in
Everybody yell like, "Watch out"
Got it too lit like, "Pipe down"
No, I can't wait, need it right now
Get guap, I'm the one who she like now
Count it up from the morning to the night now
That's the reason that a nigga wanna fight now?
'Cause my diamonds shine like a lighthouse?
(That-That-That-That-That-That be Maaly Raw)
Pull up, walk in
Everybody yell like, "Watch out"

Woah, fuck your bitch, I'm bored
Rockstar, that's of course
White girl like Lorde
She don't really get too impressed, Honda Accord
'Long as she get her beauty rest, then I'm aboard (Lil Uzi)
Got that girl wet, she need three towels (Ayy)
Call my phone like every day on speed dial
Hundred thousand, new watch, got like three dials
I don't eat out, hit once, leave out (I don't)
Breathe in, breathe in (Woo), breathe in (Woo), breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast, slow down
Back it up, rack it up, told that bitch, "Back it up" (Back it up)
Thirty nails, hammer tucked (Buh)
So there's no way that you jamming us, ooh (No way)
Breathe in (Woo), breathe in (Woo), breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast, slow down
Breathe in (Woo), breathe in (Woo), breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast, slow down
