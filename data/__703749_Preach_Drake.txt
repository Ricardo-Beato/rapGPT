Young nigga preach

Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach

I'm in Miami, I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is PARTY, not "Participation"
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm tryna do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow
I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh, it's a secret? Trust me, I'll keep it
You old niggas boring as bones
She put the PARTY tape on
You know what's going on, you know what's going on
She keep it wet like tsunami
She think she sunk the Titanic
I get her hot like wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'ma pop one for you
Drink one for you

Still in Miami, most of these girls are too messy
I gotta do some reflecting
I gotta find me one out here that's good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like, "Brrp!"
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type, yeah
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight, yeah
PND ain't with the ray-tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here, going way, way, way, way, way, way—
Sauga-city trip, the payday
Glo'd up off a Gateway, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing; doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in they feelings these days, all in they feelings these days
But hearing a scripture with that many 6's, you should be afraid

I'm preaching, oooh
Preaching, preaching, babe
Preaching, whooo
I'ma finally, finally
Yeah
Boy, you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
And I can't deny it
I want you, I'm on you245Embed
