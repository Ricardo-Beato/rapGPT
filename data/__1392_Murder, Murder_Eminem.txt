All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill

Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
This shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad, I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate, and we can operate to save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack (AHHHHHHH!)
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til the vertebrae broke
Just then, the pigs bust in yellin', "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' ki's
And a bunch of other felonies from A-to-Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill

Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back-end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face â€” "Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!"
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, "Fuck it! Mug her while you're there," jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off, kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbin' all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must've been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and must've dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', "Truce-truce!" (Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder, murder, my mi-, my, my, my mi-, my, my, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate (Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill)
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate (Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill)
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate (Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill)24Embed
