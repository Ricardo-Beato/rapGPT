I think of murder, murder on me mind
Murder on the menu, murder all the time

Today was a good day, ain't have to spray the K
Today was a good day, pour some Actavis
Today was a good day, I woke up with your bitch
Today was a good day, cross her off the list
Today was a good day, ain't have to spray the K
Today was a good day, I sold a brick of yay
Today was a good day, my brother beat his case
Today was a good day, day

Murder with the .45, murder with the nine
Murdering that bitch, put that dick up in her spine
Murder with the .45, murder with the nine
Murdering that bitch, put that dick up in her spine (Uh, ooh)

I don't do love, I don't do hate, I don't do gullible (Gullible, yeah)
Dope in the pantry, serving up candy, watch looking colorful (Colorful, bling)
Got an extendo, it's a new thing, it got kick with it (Ayy, ayy)
Got a new drum, that pa-rum-pum, I can't miss with it, uh
I'm in the four door (Four door), driving it solo (Ayy, nyoom)
Nigga, it's stolen, hop out and park 'em, nigga
Then walk home (Brrap)
All of this gang talk, gang talk
Walk with me, red dot on your head turn green
Turn your Twitter fingers to a crime scene (Splat, splat, splat)
Street sweep sweep sweep (Whoop, whoop)
Wonder how I get the dope so cheap
Plug walk, get the bags off me (Whoop, whoop, whoop)
Two for ten going in all week
Twin Glocks don't pretend round me, uh (Round me, brrt)
Hit the deck, going down 'round me ('Round me)
Couple shots have a 'round 'round me (Ayy, ayy)
One clip but it came twelve deep (Whoop, whoop, whoop)

Niggas they die, many die, die, dead niggas

Got the boy for 50 things, now he wanna kill me now
50 drums, air his mammy house out, do he feel me now?
Left his kinfolk full of leaks, in the street we play for keeps
Closed casket, aim for his head, shot him in his teeth
Mud nigga, hood nigga, opp killer, thot driller
Memphis, Tennessee we got real hitters
Drug dealers, cop killers
Gang spitters, sauce drippers
Pussy ass niggas, you need to bleed
Draco bury you like a seed, I know you niggas ain't liking me
Patta, all about that sack-uh
Ran up on me, 45 blew out his back-uh
Rack after rack-uh, you know I'm gon' stack-uh
Treat this rap shit, man, like I'm hustling crack-uh, Patta
