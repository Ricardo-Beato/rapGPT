52 ContributorsChiefin Keef Lyrics
Tadoe, the young living legend man
You know how I'm rocking like cutoff stocking, man, keep kush in my pockets, man
So many foreigns, man, this shit getting boring, man
Don't make us shoot, bitch, this Bang 2, bih

Pull off in that foreign, skrrt skrrt skrrt, she thought she seen a beast
A nigga think I’m going, ha ha ha, I got my thing with me
The Glo Gang known for glowin', heh heh, all us got a thing, a piece
Sayin' that you blowin', huh huh, but you never seen a piece
I'm high off this earth, boy, I'm higher than Jesus be
Comin' on my turf, boy, you gon' need a Jesus piece
Them bullets fly, no Nerf, boy, change yo ass like seasons be
Nigga say he lookin' for me, with my nina Chiefin' Keef

I'm high off this Earth boy, I'm where Jesus be
Shoot a nigga ass, he don't believe in me
My truck super fast, don't think you leavin' me
Tray Savage got the Mac, he make it scream for me
He shot the crowd up, he thought he seen a G
Boy, roll your loud up, 'cause you can't chief with me
I got my 9 tucked, we let it meet a nigga
I'm a cold O'Block ass nigga, I put heat to a nigga
Spent one song on a foreign, ain't got no features with it
And right now I'm gettin' so much money, I could fuck my teacher 'nem
Spent one song on a foreign, ain't got no features with it
And right now I'm gettin' so much money, I could fuck my teacher 'nem

Pull off in that foreign, skrrt skrrt skrrt, she thought she seen a beast
A nigga think I’m going, ha ha ha, I got my thing with me
The Glo Gang known for glowin', heh heh, all us got a thing, a piece
Sayin' that you blowin', huh huh, but you never seen a piece
I'm high off this earth, boy, I'm higher than Jesus be
Comin' on my turf, boy, you gon' need a Jesus piece
Them bullets fly, no Nerf, boy, change yo ass like seasons be
Nigga say he lookin' for me, with my nina Chiefin' Keef

I be with some killers and them niggas smoke the loudest weed
They got a lotta guns, they blow you down for me
They rob yo' ass, they find you got some pounds of weed
Shoot a nigga up, he can't get down with me
Like hold up, hold up, rocket launcher on his shoulder
You get hit with that, it's over, on that brick ass shit, I told ya
Holdin' my dick, where yo' hoes at?
Tray Savage got the Mac, he blows that
Hollows hit his body, body drop
I got a fuckin' Glock with a mop
If Sosa say, "Smoke his ass," then he gon' get popped
We got 100 chops and Glocks with red dots

Pull off in that foreign, skrrt skrrt skrrt, she thought she seen a beast
A nigga think I’m going, ha ha ha, I got my thing with me
The Glo Gang known for glowin', heh heh, all us got a thing, a piece
Sayin' that you blowin', huh huh, but you never seen a piece
I'm high off this earth, boy, I'm higher than Jesus be
Comin' on my turf, boy, you gon' need a Jesus piece
Them bullets fly, no Nerf, boy, change yo ass like seasons be
Nigga say he lookin' for me, with my nina Chiefin' Keef
Chiefin' Keef
Chiefin' Keef
Chiefin' Keef
Nigga say he lookin' for me, I'm with my nina Chiefin' Keef30Embed
