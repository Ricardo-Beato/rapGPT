Money good, I ain't gotta worry 'bout shit
Money good (Ahh)
Ayy, ayy

Money good
Throw up where I'm from, let 'em know I'm still hood
I ain't had to get nobody hit but I could
Before I post a pic, should I flex? Yeah, I should
I ain't gotta worry 'bout shit, money good
Ride with some hitters and they wish a bitch would
I don't wanna argue 'bout it, baby, I'm good
If she got a band let her in, yeah, she good
I ain't gotta worry 'bout shit, money good

Man, I hate a ol' lame dick-riding ass bitch
Never let a sack chaser hang in my clique
Fuck getting clout, bitch, I'm tryna get rich
Better hide your wallet when I fall in the mix
Can't deny I'm a star, you can tell by my walk
I ain't even gotta fuck him, he just love how I talk
I'm embracing the fake, I'm accepting the hate
If I wasn't number one, they wouldn't come for my place

Man, I know some broke ass niggas who be hatin'
Pop a rubber band put that money in they face
I be out here grindin' like a nigga who ain't ate
You ain't bringing nothing to the table but your plate
Bitch, I'm out here ballin' like a motherfuckin' fade
I can't gossip with you when there's money to be made
I'm tryna get my pockets 99 Ricki Lake
When you bein' real you ain't worry 'bout who fake

Money good
Throw up where I'm from, let 'em know I'm still hood
I ain't had to get nobody hit but I could

Hair long, nail long, money long, too
Get a bag, spend it, make it back time two
I could never let nobody tell me what to do
If a nigga get to trippin' then I'ma throw that boy the deuce
Pull up in a Rolls Royce finna rock a show
Clique full of bad friends, we at Pappadeaux
Rent due, finna let your baby daddy know
He in love with me but he know to play his role
