Young Chop on the beat
Ayy, turn the music up for me, Chris
Sosa on the beat

She take it slow then she wind it up (Wind it up)
I'm showing love but it's not enough (It's not enough)
Girl you look fine like wine (Like wine)
Loan me some of your time (Some of your time)
Tell me can you be my friend
I would like to tell you who I am (Bang, bang)
Baby will you take me for who I am
I'ma hold the deal up on my end
Bang, bang

I know you don't want no scrub (Yah)
Baby I'ma boss you should love that in me (Sosa baby)
She's like "But my bestfriend was like (Huh?)
'Baby he's a dog (What?) he was trynna holla at me" (Uh, uh)
I know I can fuck up, another man can luck up (Yah)
In the club dancing on your pum pum (Bang, bang)
Baby I respect you and love you (Yah)
If you let me I do not take you as a dumb-dumb (Mmm)
I'll hold you slowly (Ya-yah)
Treat you like a trophy (Ya-yah)
Get so much of you I OD (Bang, bang)
Can you pass me up like slowly (Bang, bang)
I'll wear you out like my Louie (Bang, bang, bang)
Squeeze on you like my toolie (Bang, bang, bang)
Stir you up like a smoothie (Bang, bang, bang)
Clean you up like my jewelry (Bang, bang, bang)

She take it slow then she wind it up (Wind it up)

Bang, bang

But if I get all in your back (Bang)
Snap for me like I'm a poet (Bang, bang)
Baby I'm a young Randy Moss (Yah)
I can catch it long as you throw it (Sosa baby)
I just picked you up some Roses in the Lotus (I did)
I just picked up some spice for the potion (Bang, bang)
Just picked up a new scent from Barney's, baby (New scent)
You know that I smell like I'm ballin' (Bang, bang)
You know that I ain't used to one night (Yah)
I can have you here in one flight, baby (Mmm)
It's just me and you in one boat (Mmm)
They see us on this yacht, they gon' go crazy (Mmm)
Your friends know how much you love me (Sosa baby)
But they be still tryna fuck with me (Bang, bang)
When it comes to them I act like I'm rusty (Sosa baby)
Baby I won't lie, just trust me
She take it slow then she wind it up (Wind it up)
I'm showing love but it's not enough (It's not enough)

Loan me some of your time (Some of your time)
Tell me can you be my friend
