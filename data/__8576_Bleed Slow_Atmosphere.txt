8 ContributorsBleed Slow Lyrics
I think her ponytail's a little too tight
Because she's alone walking with me in this moonlight
Tonight she fits in my palm
The storm isn't anywhere close to calm
Look, I've gone and captured the mortal
Put my face to hers clutched her by the torso
And when the lips touched I inhaled
Didn't matter that she hadn't been kissed much
It's such a shame some have a name
And everyone becomes the same
Can't help but adore each one he's torn
From the pores of the face of the earth's core
This is ones more difficult than the last one
This one had an open window she could ask him
If someday he'll be the one to come and save her
Take her away before she takes her away

Take her away to where she didn't need to go
Life fast, bleed slow
Will he ever know the power of speak
Wouldn't be what it was if the prey wasn't weak

Take a peak into the way I seek
The water for the creek
The daughter of the speak
Slaughter of the meak
The Godly technique
The monster marches to a different beat
She don't love herself no more
Won't be nobody elses whore
No one like him spoke before
Now he's gonna take her to see the seashore
There you can stare at the waves
Be brave, take your place, you're safe
Slowly he traces her face with an index fingertip full of hate
Love 'em and leave 'em, love 'em or they leave you
Some see the glow but some glow is see through
As life leaves her body, sometimes he screams: "Me too !"
All he ever wanted was to teach you to reach you
Death is the cousin of sleep
Just close your eyes count sheep and breathe deep
Think about the sound of relief that surrounds you
You were already gone before I found you

Live fast, bleed slow
