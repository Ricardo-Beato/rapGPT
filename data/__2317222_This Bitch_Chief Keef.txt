18 ContributorsThis Bitch Lyrics
Yung Cryptonite
Chysty on the beat

This bitch be calling my phone, ayy
This bitch won't leave me 'lone
This bitch wanna smoke all my strong
This bitch gotta go home
This bitch
This bitch think she the shit
Said she ain't lie she like me but I know she is, ayy
Baby girl, tricks are for kids
Nah, I don't trust that bitch

I don't want it like Tommy, I'm Nesquik with this bitch, ayy
I'm about my money, can't mix that with this shit, ayy
You about that gunplay, then with that you get hit, ayy
We ain't 'bout that Bombay, go red rum with this shit, ayy
What's that backwards? Murder
Got killed for that bitch and all she wanted was Furla
Hand back, just hit that, told her get back
Then this bitch say she love me, I can't dig that
Girl, you just smoked some lil parlor
He say you don't, I'm like "Word up"
She say being a thot, she ain't heard of
But I act like I ain't heard her
You might also like
This bitch be calling my phone, ayy
This bitch won't leave me 'lone
This bitch wanna smoke all my strong
This bitch gotta go home
This bitch
This bitch think she the shit
Said she ain't lie she like me but I know she is, ayy
Baby girl, tricks are for kids
Nah, I don't trust that bitch

She say she wanna fuck me, then I'ma sue her
I just want some top, she thought I was gon' do her
Bitch, I'm posted with my Ruger
Just in case this bitch screw up, ayy
This bitch say she wanna make up, then
I told that bitch to put on her make-up, then
This bitch say she wanna break up
I told that bitch that I'ma player
This bitch a freak in the sheets but thot in the streets
Told that bitch ain't nobody meeting my mama but me
This bitch wanna count my hundreds with me
I told that bitch I brought my money counter with me

This bitch be calling my phone, ayy
This bitch won't leave me 'lone
This bitch wanna smoke all my strong
This bitch gotta go home
This bitch
This bitch think she the shit
Said she ain't lie she like me but I know she is, ayy
Baby girl, tricks are for kids
Nah, I don't trust that bitchEmbed
