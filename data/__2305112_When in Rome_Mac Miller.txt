70 ContributorsWhen in Rome Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha
Uh

All the freaks comin' out when the sun down (Woo!)
Hatin' on it, I don't give a fuck now (Woo!)
Bad little bitch with her tongue out (Tongue out)
Told her go long, this a touchdown (Touchdown)
Do this for the city and the state (State)
Bust in, better bring me to the safe (Safe)
Want it right now, I ain't really tryna wait (No)
Got me on trial but I'm beatin' that case (Beatin' that case)
Motherfucker, say it to my face, say it to my face
Motherfucker, go and (Say it to my face) (Say it to my face)
Trippin' now, everything straight
Rappers all wanna drop it now and they can't even get a date (Woo!)
Feelin' great, I'm the man here (Man here)
If you got a problem, don't stand here (Stand here)
In the middle of the ocean, see the land near (Land near)
In the helicopter, fuck it, we gon' land here (Land here)
When in, when in Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in Rome
When in, when in Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in Rome (Woo)
When in, when in Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in Rome
When in, when in Rome (Yeah)
When in Rome, when in, when in Rome (Rome)

Bad little bitch and her ass fat (Ass fat)
I give it to the homie, he can have that (Take it)
You talkin' that shit, where the racks at? (Woo)
They keep you on the shelf where the racks at (Goddamn)
I'm just tryin' to go and see the Colosseum (Woo)
When I die, they better build a mausoleum
I don't got time, bitch, I'm high, ain't a secret
I don't got time, bitch, I'm high, ain't a secret (Motherfucker)
Everybody and their mother wanna rap now
Tell 'em cut a check for a youngin', I'ma cash out (Woo)
Walkin' in the back door to the pat down
On my shit, you can borrow my bitch, give her back now (Right now)
I'ma need that (Right now), give her back now (Right now)
I'ma need that (Right motherfuckin'â€”)
Came up from the gravel to the motherfuckin' castle (Woo)
Broke culture, all we do is trappin' (Choo)
At the table breakin' bread with Italians (Uh)
Got a whole bunch of bitches doin' Valiums (Uh-huh)
Make a song every day, got a thousand (Got a thousand)
Got a whole bunch of trophies and medallions (And medallions)
Been the motherfuckin' man before the motherfuckin' money
Got another hundred grand, but who's countin'? Whoa
When in, when in, when in Rome (Rome)
I was nineteen with the homies goin' round the globe (Globe)
75K now to book me for a show
Muh'fuckers can't see me when they standin' on they toes
Goddamn, look up, goddamn, look up

I'm at the top of my game
(Goddamn) Don't mean to be rude
But me and you? We are not one and the same
(Goddamn) I'm eatin' your food
And fuckin' your bitch, 'cause you is a lame
(Goddamn) Pittsburgh
Where I live, stir a little kid
Goddamn, my life changed
I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
Said I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
Yeah, I made a couple million off rap like it's nothin'
Keep that shit quiet, I don't stunt too much
She gon' fuck me, she don't give it up too much
Drink liquor like water, gettin' drunk too much, I
I was off them drugs too much
In the crib fuckin' all these little sluts too much
How it is when you young, blowin' up too much
Talkin' shit, but I know that you ain't up to much
Man, I been workin', said I'm the greatest
Now that I'm certain, Benzo the latest
Drunk and I'm swervin', I'm goin' ape-shit on all of my verses
Fuck bein' famous, I'm here to fuck up your favorite
Lately I'm hearin' too much of the same shit
Young and I'm faded, killin' shit, bury it under my basement

Shut your motherfuckin' mouth, bitch (Silence)
Fuck your motherfuckin' couch, bitch (Violent)
Yeah, you talkin', you ain't 'bout shit
Swear you a lame
I'ma keep killin' shit, let them all hate
Bitches in love with my face, yeah, I'm collectin'
I need that money today19Embed
