45 Contributors65 Hunnid Lyrics
Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta God, baby, get on your knees (Baby girl, get on your knees)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot, 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot, 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot, 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)

Running to get to that check, I'm coming
Jumping out of that back seat, busting
Bust, bust, missions with the blower as a young'un'
Back when Killa Mo had 'em coppin' crystal through the prison door
Feel the four, when I'm feelin' low, time to stretch a nigga
Riding through your section, shit, I hope you got protection with you
Hop out when the cops out, shit, I'm cold with mine
Forty-five, brown rag, green light, Yoda time

Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta God, baby, get on your knees (Baby girl, get on your knees)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot, 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot, 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot, 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)
You might also like
You aloneâ€”car full of niggas, but you alone (Nigga, you alone)
It's time to show how much you love your home
It's one nigga outside, two niggas up inside the store
One nigga gon' die, the other two can come along
Gloves with the disguise, bang the set before you blow
Don't stop 'til he drop, don't shoot for the skies or shoot for his toes
I told you before that niggas gotta die for this shit to survive
Is you with it or not? Get to knocking, then
Problem is, lot of niggas scared of the consequence
Common sense missing from your head when the pressure on
Niggas from my home ain't enroll in the colleges
Fuck a class, junkies hitting glass, get the money long
Gleaming with the tints and the stash, no tags
Bumping poison on the ave, getting cash 'til a nigga gone ('Til a nigga gone)
And ain't shit wrong with the truth
Got the juice, would've threw that nigga Bishop off the roof, hey!

Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta God, baby, get on your knees (Baby girl, get on your knees)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot, 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot, 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot, 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)25Embed
