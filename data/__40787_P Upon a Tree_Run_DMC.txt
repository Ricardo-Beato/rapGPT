2 ContributorsP Upon a Tree Lyrics	Yo Dee let's break out we late man, hurry up
	Alright man let's go to Poppa Ken's, get some 40-dogs man
	Aiyyo man pull over! {*tires squeal*}
	What for? {*car door*}
	I gotta take a piss man

I got to pee I got to pee upon a tree, right
I got to pee I got to pee upon a tree..
I pee upon a tree because I drink too much Olde E
And not time, for pee, to come out, on me, so I
I go and pee I go and pee upon a tree, right
I go and pee I go and pee upon a tree.. (buk buk buk)
The people walk by and say, "Aiyy D.M.C.!"
"No no, no no, yo bro it is not me." right?
I got to pee I got to pee upon a tree, right
I got to pee I got to pee upon a tree..You might also likeEmbed
