16 ContributorsTYT Lyrics
Huh, Gato
Alias, Wizop, Gato, huh?

Thick, young, tender
She ain't no PYT
She ain't ever had a nigga like me
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
She ain't ever met a nigga like me
She got a bust-down Rollie like me (burr, burr, burr)
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
She ain't ever met a nigga like me
Nah, never meet a nigga like me (Gato)
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
Sugar daddy got so much cheese (wow)
Pusha man I push so much piece (burr)
Get nasty as you wanna be

Oh, I'm, showin' out, that lil' hair done growed out
Guwop 808 just dropped and I threw up the whole knot
Stove top, smokin' hot, been scrapin' this pot a whole lot
In Magic City parkin' lot, I threw up the whole profit
Old prophet, told you shit 'bout first you even heard 'bout it
Rock salad, ten bricks in a day, she not worried 'bout it
Big money, Gucci Mane, I know you freak hoes heard 'bout me
So much money, so much sauce, I might try dress everybody
Gucci poppin', I don't want it if I ain't the first to cop
Top droppin', window tinted darkly so she not stoppin'
Ho poppin', she so turnt your ho tried take my ho shoppin'
Legs lockin' 'cause I'm tryna fuck her like the feds watchin'
You might also like
Thick, young, tender
She ain't no PYT
She ain't ever had a nigga like me
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
She ain't ever met a nigga like me
She got a bust-down Rollie like me (burr, burr, burr)
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
She ain't ever met a nigga like me
Nah, never meet a nigga like me (Gato)
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
Sugar daddy got so much heat (wow)
Pusha man I push so much piece (burr)
Get nasty as you wanna be

Gettin' money in the club, and she know
See the dope man, ho, she know
And her old man used to sell dope
All her exes done moved kilos
She a thick young tender, she grown
I'm the plug, only thing she know
Over 21, she way past grown
And her booty got so so swole
Titties just got done, they swole
She a fool, how she work that pole
So thick, make a nigga look backwards
Leave marks on her neck like Dracula
To a kingpin, money don't matter
If he want it, then he come and get at her
She fuckin' her way up the ladder
That ass gettin' fatter and fatter
Thick, young, tender
She ain't no PYT
She ain't ever had a nigga like me
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
She ain't ever met a nigga like me
She got a bust-down Rollie like me (burr, burr, burr)
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
She ain't ever met a nigga like me
Nah, never meet a nigga like me (Gato)
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
Sugar daddy got so much heat (wow)
Pusha man I push so much piece (burr)
Get nasty as you wanna be1Embed
