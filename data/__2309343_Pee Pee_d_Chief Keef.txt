29 ContributorsPee Peeâ€™d Lyrics
(Sosa on the beat)

I put ice all on my body, I put money all in my pocket
I put square feet all in my house, got no reason to be rowdy
Keep all them squares from 'round me, Master P, boy is you bout it?
Roll past, came back around, they like "Chief Sosa you clowning"
Eat all the green, it's so clean ,hoes think we Downy
I'm flexing like I'm Popeye, Krusty keep me clowning
Ayy, I'm so damn ignorant
I pulled out my ding-a-ling and start pee peeing

My wrist look like pee
My name is Keef
Roll it up and chief the weed
I'm so high I don't know my damn A-B-C's
Count it out like one two three
Four five six, no these not G's
These hundred thousands, bitch it's legal
Now my doors go up, I remember stealing regals
I'm counting cashm no I'm not sleeping
I ain't sleeping till two weeks from next week
This ho gone fuck me cause my tweet
And I only tweeted if she wife she get a treat
You might also like
I put ice all on my body, I put money all in my pocket
I put square feet all in my house, got no reason to be rowdy
Keep all them squares from 'round me, Master P, boy is you bout it?
Roll past, came back around, they like "Chief Sosa you clowning"
Eat all the green it's so clean hoes think we downy
I'm flexing like I'm Popeye, Krusty keep me clowning
Ayy, I'm so damn ignorant
I pulled out my ding-a-ling and start pee peeing

I  pulled out my dick, and I pee'd
In public, I don't care no fuck who sees
My watch blinging, it is freezing
It's the reason why I ain't hiding this heater
I put the money with the money let it sing
Sosa T-Pain, let me buy you a drink
I ain't got to talk, I hit her with that wink
Then she start telling me her favorite color's pink
When I was young, my mom told me to go hard
Now I am dancing with the stars
I bought a lion then I turned it to a rug
I bought a bear and I mixed it with some fox
It's the reason why my leather is so soft
I got python, all up on my drawers
I got satin all on my fucking sheets
Diamonds in my Glo, man, no Jesus piece
I put ice all on my body, I put money all in my pocket
I put square feet all in my house, got no reason to be rowdy
Keep all them squares from round me, Master P, boy is you bout it?
Roll past, came back around, they like "Chief Sosa you clowning"
Eat all the green it's so clean hoes think we downy
I'm flexing like I'm Popeye, Krusty keep me clowning
Ayy, I'm so damn ignorant
I pulled out my ding-a-ling and start pee peeing3Embed
