3 ContributorsDark Side of the Wall: 2000 LyricsKill
Time is running out
Prophecy is a mean thing
The prophets are together
No one will be permitted to get in this area
Except by special pass issued by state or military prop
The year of our lord two thousand
Hysteria of music
The war will become a single machine
Then is a story about what happened and why
The explosion the explosion
Then is a story about what happened and why
Four three two one
Kill
The terrifying future
The terrifying future
