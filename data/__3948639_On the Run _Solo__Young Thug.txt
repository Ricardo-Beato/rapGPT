51 ContributorsOn the Run (Solo) Lyrics
Yeah, I'm on the run
Here I come, I'm with your moms
(Fuck all that, let's go)
We got London On Da Track

If the opp come, I get to squeezin' on the mop
I'm on the run, bitch, I just took off on the cops
I don't need a charm, bitch, I need a lawyer an' rocks
I got the drum, bitch, 'bout to connect some of these dots, ayy
I just might hop inside a cab today (Skrt)
Lamborghini Urus, paper tag today (Aye)
When I bend the corner, man, the rims bent (Bent)
Burberry guts what the captain say (Slatt)
Chanel, she can get a little today (Chanel)
Fuck around and drop a few bags today
I just might do the whole dash today (Woo!)
My new Balenciaga rags today (Oh, damn, woo!)

Niggas might kill for biscuits
Trappin' out the intercontinental (Hey!)
Bitch can't wait 'til my check clear
Bitch gon' act like she triller (Act like she triller)
Baby tryna trip me outta check (Whoa)
Nigga tryna pour my red
All a nigga know is take meds
Nigga, stop drinkin' my red (Woo!)

Slime all these niggas, I'm tired of trie
I just sit back and smoke out a pound of weed (Smoke out)
I got rollies galore, ain't no clowning me
I got woadies with me speaking Chinese (Got woadies right now, now)
I get fed up and throw a catastrophe (Fed up)
In the drop, me, my dog had 'em ten key (Woo!)
Secret service, so everything is touchscreen
I had walked in the loft, didn't insert a key (blast-off)
Okay, patty cake, baguettes, the karats, no carrot cake (baguettes! Yeah, bitch)
For God's sake, stack up your racks, put it all away (ooh, let's go)
Polish your ass, polish your stomach
And polish your face (Polish your face)
Stack up the cash, go buy Richard Mille, that's all I can say (woo!)
Whole lotta gang shit, whole lotta this and that
Whole lotta ain't this (Whole lotta, whole lotta)
Whole lotta cash over here, no whole lotta playing (Oh, oh)
I spent your stash box on a little Mercedes
I popped at the last opp, and I end up escapin'

If the opp come, I get to squeezin' on the mop
I'm on the run, bitch, I just took off on the cops
I don't need a charm, bitch, I need a lawyer an' rocks
I got the drum, bitch, 'bout to connect some of these dots, ayy
I just might hop inside a cab today (I just might hop inside a cab)
Lamborghini Urus paper tag today (Urus paper tag)
When I bend the corner, man, the rims bent (when I bend the corner, the rims)
Burberry guts what the captain say (Whoa-whoa-whoa-oh)
Chanel, she can get a little today (Chanel)
Fuck around and drop a few bags today (Fuck 'round)
I just might do the whole dash today (Hold up)
My new Balenciaga rags today (Swoop)
Niggas might kill for biscuits
Trappin' out the intercontinental
Bitch can’t wait ‘til my check clear
Bitch gon’ act like she triller
Baby tryna trip me outta check (Whoa)
Nigga tryna pour my red (Whoa)
All a nigga know is take meds (Whoa)
Nigga, stop drinkin' my red

I want the baddest señora, I'm bout to turn this bitch up
I just want to tell you she told you, yeah
She say she want it in her butt
I told that bitch "bend it over"
I'm a kingpin, yeah
Yeah, bitch, I got weight like a boulder (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
On the west coast with no spokes (Nah)
You said that you ridin (You said)
You said you in (Yeah)
You sure stayed down, now you in a Benz
This livelihood we livin' in
It's all good in this life of sin
I have a boatload of diamonds
When I get tired of this rhyming
I'm trying to kidnap your hotness
He bout' to catch him a body
I stand the stick up on one feet
Bitch bout as tall as your body
Don't let it slide when you try me
Ain't no big gunnin' around me
Hop off the jet we was nine deep
It was a 16-passenger seat
I like the way you been rhyming
One of one, no siamese
I got my card on file, dirty Miami gon' fix all my Chinese
Fuck 'til our lights out on a jet, when we wake up
I think flying me there
Yeah, the top of it's brown (The top of it's brown)
Yeah, the middle of it's red (Middle of it's red)
Yeah, she nut by the round
They call it squirtin' intead (Let's go)
Yeah, I like her for real (Like her for real)
We skippin' town from the feds (Let's go)
This codeine on chill (Act!)
She wet like a shower head (Woo-hoo!)
Yeah, I came with the drill (I came with the drill)
I came with the powers and nails (Powers and nails, whoa-yeah)
I came with the deals (Whoa)
I came in with hoes like a sled (Whoa-yeah)
Yeah, a rich nigga tilt (Whoa)
I keep a Rolls Royce in this shit (keep Rolls Royce in this)
Yeah, I'm fuckin' your nat (Fuckin' your nat)
'Fore we done got to the bed ('Fore we done got to the bed)
If the opp come, I get to squeezin' on the mop
I'm on the run, bitch, I just took off on the cops
I don't need a charm, bitch, I need a lawyer an' rocks
I got the drum, bitch, 'bout to connect some of these dots, ayy
I just might hop inside a cab today
Lamborghini Urus, paper tag today (Ayy)
When I bend the corner, man, the rims bent (Bent)
Burberry guts what the captain say (Slatt)
Chanel, she can get a little today (Chanel)
Fuck around and drop a few bags today
I just might do the whole dash today (Woo!)
My new Balenciaga rags today (Oh, damn, woo!)
