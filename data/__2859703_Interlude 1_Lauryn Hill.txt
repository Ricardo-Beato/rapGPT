4 ContributorsInterlude 1 LyricsI'll tell you, um... Every single one of these songs, um, is about me first. Me first, um, it was like, you know, there was a period of time where I was just out, you know, just, just gone from the public, and, uh, I came to terms with the fact that... I had created this, uh, public persona, this public illusion.
And it became, it, uh, it held me hostage; like I couldn't be a real person because you're too afraid of, you know, what your, your public will say.
And at that point I had to do some dying and really accept the fact that, look, "this is who I am, and I have to be who I am, and all of us have a right to be who we are, and whenever we submit our will, because our will is a gift, it is given to us, so whenever we submit our will to someone else's opinion, you know, I mean, a part of us dies."
You know, and so it's been, um... it's been... it actually hasn't been a long time. It feels like a long time, but it hasn't been a long time. Some miraculous things have happened in a short amount of time, and uh, I'm just very blessed to be able to be here today and get to share with you some of the things I've learned.
I know some of it sounds almost cryptic and I been really just, just really... waiting for the patience and really just articulate where I'm coming from as simply as possible, so I'm working on that.
But um... you know, I know, that you know that there's, uh... you know that I know that God doesn't lie and I know that he knows how to talk to the hearts of people better than anybody else, so I don't worry about that, cause whatever he relates to whomever is listening, that's what supposed to be understood at that time, so it's all good.
But, um, this is a song called "Oh Jerusalem".Embed
