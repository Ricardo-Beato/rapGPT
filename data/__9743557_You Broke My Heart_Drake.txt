Yeah
Yeah
Oh, baby, don't go
Don't go
Look
Look

My notepad caught many bodies
Screenshots solved plenty problems
Voice notes bagged plenty hotties
Can't just talk to me like anybody
Can't just talk to me like anybody
Man, you bitches know that I'm a somebody
And lil' baby bad, she got a Jung body
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bunch of feelings I just couldn't shake
Disrespect that I just shouldn't take
You just couldn't see the good in Drake
Four months not a long time, but you fucked somebody, you just couldn't wait
You broke my heart, you broke my heart

It hurts
Yeah
If you just believe
Yeah

I put careers on shelves like Amazon distribution center help
Really hate to call lil' broski for the dirty work, I'd rather do it by myself, grrah, grrah, grrah
My tour route'll leave a lazy nigga dizzy
Got more tracks than when a hair salon is busy
Flow for days like that River Mississippi
Freaky nigga like I sing with Pretty Ricky
Huh? Yeah, yeah
Got the ad-libs from Smiggy
Nails done, but my trigger finger itchy
Clutchin' on a blicky, shit is gettin' tricky
People love to diss me, I hear
Every single thing, man, I'm all ears like I took the fam to Disney
Guess that's one way to tell me that you miss me

Don't go
Don't go
Yeah

You broke my heart
I had my doubts about you from the start
Pushed to the edge like Vert
On Instagram, diggin' up dirt
You wanted smoke with me first
Well, this one gon'—
Yeah, this one gon' hurt
Down bad boys, sad boys, I been representin' since birth
Yeah, I was down bad 'bout you, but I'm 'bout to have you down worse
I swear you're dead to me, does Mercedes make a hearse?
Matter fact, everybody in this bitch scream out, "Fuck my ex"
Yeah, fuck my ex
Fuck my ex (Fuck my ex)
Fuck my ex (Fuck my ex)
Fuck my ex (Middle fingers up)
Fuck my ex ('Boutta turn this bitch up)
Fuck my ex
Fuck my ex (I should drop a name)
Fuck my ex (Drop a couple names)
Fuck my ex (Since you want some fame)
Fuck my ex (Yeah, pussy niggas that you turnin' up with)
Fuck my ex (In a whip, clownin' on me, yeah)
Fuck my ex (Fuck my ex)
Fuck my ex (Yeah, fuck my ex)
Fuck my ex (Fuck my ex)
Fuck my ex (Woah, woah, woah)
Fuck my ex (I can't let it go)
Fuck my ex (Payback a bitch)
It's fuck my ex (If you ain't did this shit)
Fuck my ex (You would've popped off, you would've said shit)
Fuck my ex (You would've posted shit, I know your ass too well)
Fuck my ex (Fuck my ex)

Lyin'
Lyin' to my face
Thought you would've shown a little grace
How can I expect someone who never had they own place to know they damn place?
Treatin' me like I'm dumb or somethin'
Like you're runnin' somethin'
Like they dropped you on your head when you was one or somethin'
Fuck my ex, ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck my ex, yeah, right, right, right3Embed
