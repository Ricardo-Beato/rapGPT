31 ContributorsPeep Show Lyrics

When you're breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down
This is what it sounds like when I'm breakin' it down
Yeah, I'm breakin' it down
Man, this is what it feels like when I'm breakin' it down
When you're breaking it down, keep breakin' it down
It's not my fault (C'mon)
It's not my fault
I'm hot, man, it's not my fault (C'mon)
It's not my fault

'Til the sun comes up every night (C'mon)
We party and we party 'til daylight
We be gettin' it in, come on, we gettin' it in
Little Hennessy, a little juice and gin
It's not a fantasy (Nah), it's not pretend
We gon' do it, we gon' do it, we gon' do it again
'Til the sun comes up every night
We party and we party 'til daylight
I shouldn't have to tell you, shorty, you should know (Yep)
I'm really really gettin' into your freakshow (Uh huh)
You give me a little, baby, then I'ma want mo' (That's right)
O.D.B. said it, "I like it raw!"
Exotic, erotic, we're movin on the floor (Woo!)
Enough to make a nigga lose control (Yeah!)
I'm down to go wherever you wan' go
You got a man, I keep it on the low
I do my thing, you know I gets my dough
I got a few stacks me and you could blow
We headed to the hotel after the show
I know how to romance ya, be my private dancer (Yeah!)
You might also like
On your mark, get set, girl, now here we go (Here we go)
Racin' off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When you're breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down
Ready or not, shorty, now here I go (Here I go)
Shake that thing, girl, now back it up
Work it, work it, girl, you turn me on (Haha)
When you're breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down

They say I'm not the same, it's 'cause I'm filthy, man
I'm off the chain, I don't play no games
I'm hustlin' hard, homie, I do my thang
You fuck with the paper, then watch the hammer go bang
Now, shorty, I like the way she move them hips
I'm tryna get her in my bedroom and shit
We could take a long time or get it done quick
We can camcord this shit, make a boom-boom flick
It's oh so many places that we can go
I really want you, shorty, shorty, now you should know
Girl, your body's callin me, hear you loud and clear
We ain't got to leave now, we can do it right here

On your mark, get set, girl, now here we go (Here we go)
Racin' off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When you're breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down
Ready or not, shorty, now here I go (Here I go)
Shake that thing, girl, now back it up
Work it, work it, girl, you turn me on (Haha)
When you're breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down
The way you move (The way you move)
You make me lose (You make me lose)
All control (All control)
I know you know (I know you know)

You're so seductive, you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell you, you know I wanna fuck you
I'm feelin' your style, you better watch me now
My tongue'll be in your mouth, my hands'll be in your blouse
When you get me aroused, you put a spell on me
Man, if I can't have you, I'ma go crazy
I want you bad now, and if you want me
Girl, come to me now, I said come to me now

Come to me now, you don't come to me now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
Twenty minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
The way you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you, had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin' me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
You can leave, but wait, I gotta shit on you still
I shouldn't have to say it, shorty, you should know
I hope you really gettin' into my creepshow
Let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down
On your mark, get set, girl, now here we go (Here we go)
Racin' off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When you're breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down
Ready or not, shorty, now here I go (Here I go)
Shake that thing, girl, now back it up
Work it, work it, girl, you turn me on (Haha)
When you're breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down

It's not my fault (C'mon)
It's not my fault
I could break it down, it's not my fault (C'mon)
It's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault (C'mon)
It's not my fault
I can break it down, it's not my fault (C'mon)
It's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault (C'mon)8Embed
