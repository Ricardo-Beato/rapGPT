4 ContributorsMake tha Trap Say Aye (80 Gz) Lyrics
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"

I'm twerking birds in, so we working
Packing a truck, stop, a trailer back in
We big flip jugs, we took it off the forklift
The way my plug kick it, you'd think he had a black belt
My scale so big, Big Boy can weigh his damn self
Two thousand pounds of mid, I sold that shit my damn self
Washer full of cash, dryer full of X pills
Red rag in my pocket same color my 'Vette is
My number lower than a ee√© from Texas
A quarter mill in the mail is an investment
A sniper rifle like a soldier in the desert
An Eagle on me, boy, I'm known to tote a Desert
I sacked an ounce up before I sold a record
He want a brick, I told him, "Meet me by the Checker's"
I sacked a pound up before I sold a record
He want a bale, I told him, "Meet me by the Checker's"

Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"Embed
