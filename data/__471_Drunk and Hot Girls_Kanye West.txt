We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

We go
Through too
Much shit
To mess
Mess with
These drunk
All of these drunk and hot girls

Driving 'round town, looking for the best spot
For the drunk and hot girls
Up in the club, look at here what we got
Some drunk and hot girls
Stop dancing with your girlfriend and come dance with me
Stop talking 'bout your boyfriend since he is not me
Stop running up my tab 'cause these drinks is not free
You drunk and hot girl
You might also like
We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls

We go
Through too
Much shit
To mess
Mess with
These drunk
All of these drunk and hot girls

I don't want to drop your friends off, I just want you
You drunk and hot girls
You want to sit down but we hit the drive-thru
You drunk and hot girls
Please don't fall asleep, baby, we almost back
Please don't throw up in the car, we almost crashed
Oh, now you sober, how'd I know you'd say that?
You drunk and hot girl

We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
We go
Through too
Much shit
To mess
Mess with
These drunk
All of these drunk and hot girls

Love, the dangerous necessity that people seek
Without regard to where they are
The human heart is curious above all things
Love, the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays, it's sweet delight
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right
Your dress is tight
Oh, how, I want you right now

Don't tell me, you sing, you about to get a deal
You drunk and hot girls
"Ah-da-da-da-da," That's how the fuck you sound
You drunk and hot girls, yeah
You only live once, do whatever you like
I thought I'd be with you for only one night
Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life
That drunk and hot girl
We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
(A little sippy-sippy)
We go through too much bullshit
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
(Did she say she want a brewski?)

We go
Through too
Much shit
To mess
Mess with
These drunk
All of these drunk and hot girls
