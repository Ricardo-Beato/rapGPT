60 ContributorsMovin’ Too Fast Lyrics
I put the streets on beast (Streets)
I been geeked all week (Geeked)
I go to sleep, I don't eat (Sleep), cross-eyed, make a nigga go weak (Uh)
Yeah, gas tank on E, yeah, but the safe on full (Full)
Yeah, got the heart of a lion (Huh), yeah, head's on like a bull (Bull)
Yeah, nigga talk real fast (Huh), 'til I got the cash and I ran past (Racks)
Ooh, grandma on my ass tellin' me, "Boy, you movin' too fast" (Grandma, ayy)
Cash deposits, get the coupe just to match the watches (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Hit the gas and harrass the ‘Rari, diamonds bitin', this glass is water (Argh)

Yeah, came in the game, tryna aim for the best
Chain for the gang, ain't bought this shit (Gang gang)
Everybody 'round me sellin' cold bricks (Freeze)
We let it fly with the fire with no kick (Brrr)
I don't wanna unify with no clique (Who?)
Thirty plus a forty-five on my wrist (Woo)
42 on the dial, that's a big shield (Yeah)
Livin' life, wanna vibe with my bitch (Ayy)
500K to the cancer (Woo)
Come ride with the wave, but I'm handsome (Wave)
Givin' back to the face of the planet (Givin' back)
Then I bust out a chain with a niner (Bust down)
Ain't shit basic, baby (Basic), ain't 'bout to feed you fugazi, baby (Baby)
Yeah, I'm from the nawf side, baby, you're fuckin' with a big dog, all-star, baby (Ayy)
My heart is so numb, I cannot cry, I don't got feelings (No, woo)
Up to par and I'm on fire and I got millions (And I'm on fire)
Smokin' on cookie, it end up in ashes for all my niggas (Smokin' on cookie)
I'm only fuckin' with gang 'cause I cannot fuck with these niggas (Gang)
