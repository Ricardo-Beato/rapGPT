(Spoken)
Cause I get allot of that, I get allot of that
Put your hands in the air, if you get allot of that
If you get allot of that, I get allot of that
Put your hands in the air if you get allot of that

Let's talk about hate, cause I get allot of that
We can talk about money, cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that, I get allot of that
I get allot of that, cause I get allot of that
Let's talk about hate, cause I get allot of that
Or we can talk about money, cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that, I get allot of that
I get allot of that, cause I get allot of that

This can't be it
Man this shit too stressful
Is that what it is
I'm too successful
Maybe I'm to good
Too hood
Low down no good
I just keep shit real
Like you should
Twist my fingers
Throw up my hood
Let's get this money
I know I would
I know that's right
But still we do wrong
J-bo got 30, but still we moved on
Hit them clubs up, get my groove on
I stay iced out, get my cool on
Best be cool homes
Get my goon on
I'll bust them tools homes
Get my news on

Let's talk about hate, cause I get allot of that
We can talk about money, cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that, I get allot of that
I get allot of that, cause I get allot of that
Let's talk about hate, cause I get allot of that
Or we can talk about money, cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that, I get allot of that
I get allot of that, cause I get allot of that

They say Young fell off
Yeah the boy done lost it (What!?)
Been ballin all my life baby
I'm just exhausted
I take a Gatorade break
To get everything straight
Now I'm sittin here like how much Gatorade make
How much money would it take
To make some mo money
Damn right a nigga straight
Come get some mo' from me
I sold millions
Made them millions
But still y'all doubt me
What's this with out me
Can't be that bad
Still got my trap swag
And everytime I do a show
I leave with a trap bag
Money in trash bags
I call that garbage
20 pounds a trash bag
The shit look like garbage
Let's talk about hate, cause I get allot of that
We can talk about money, cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that, I get allot of that
I get allot of that, cause I get allot of that
Let's talk about hate, cause I get allot of that
Or we can talk about money, cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that, I get allot of that
I get allot of that, cause I get allot of that

I get allot of that, allot of this
I need allot of it
Sit on my bedroom floor counting all of it
That money be Ludacris
It just might shock ya
If you can't find Chaka
Then my right hand's Kinky
Look, I am simply
One of the best
Can't even lie
I can't vouch for the the rest
Just like Ziploc
Made a killin' in plastic
Best add five grams
That's if you weigh it in plastic
I am so dope
Need to wrap me in plastic
When they wrap me in plastic
Need to put me in traffic
They say that I'm difficult
Even different
Show me the difference
I'll bring you the difference
Let's talk about hate, cause I get allot of that
We can talk about money, cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that, I get allot of that
I get allot of that, cause I get allot of that
Let's talk about hate, cause I get allot of that
Or we can talk about money, cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that, I get allot of that
I get allot of that, cause I get allot of that

Cause I get allot of that
I get allot of that
And I seen allot of that
I see allot of that
And I sold allot of that
Let's go nigga, whassup
Young
What y'all thought it was a game or somethin'?
But even if it was a game, you know I was playin' nigga!1Embed
