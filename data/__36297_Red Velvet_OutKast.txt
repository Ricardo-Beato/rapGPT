48 ContributorsRed Velvet Lyrics
One more time for y'all, y-y-yeah, huh
If you didn't know you know now, OutKast, Stankonia
We shittin' on ery'body talkin' that bullshit

Now Peter Piper picked a pepper, that was his downfall
I'm down with 'Dre 3000 cause he got my back y'all
Ball if you want to, but do it with some class, G
Ask me, do OutKast got some flows so you can blast me
Nasty, niggas on the point they see you shining
Engineers in the studio see me rhyming
Don't get me wrong, got four albums; stay consisent
You got a bodyguard, I let my nigga tote the biscuit
Twist ya cap back, you got blood off on ya fur hat
Cap, cap, ya link snapped, you slumped off in ya Cadillac
For what though, some diamonds and a Bentley
What you dying for?
Alright hoe, I'mma bank my cheese and let my mic glow
Prioritize to live to tell these other niggas how you
Bought yo' kid some tennis shoes
Let these brothers know that your mama she got her house too
Let these niggas know that your sister wouldn't have finished
College.. without you, I doubt you do that though
So do this here and keep that bullshit out of our ear
You too near me to not hear me, to open to conceal me
The love for the music keeping Big Boi spittin' real G
You might also like
'Cause they know where you live
And they've seen what ya drive
And they say they gonna put one in your helmet
'Cause you brag 'bout that watch
And all them things that you got (Good God!)
Them dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet (Good God!)

Yeah, this nigga wanna floss?
Yeah, we got this nigga now
Yo T, I got a nigga right for us
I'ma take him to the hotel
You know how it's gon' go...
Nigga, keep braggin' (Mhm)
(Yeah)
Yeah, we got him now...

How can you measure a nigga by multiple figures
He may got, got, got
Had he not purchased the newest Mercedes
That lose it's value soon as you drive that bitch off the lot, lot, lot
Would he still be the ladies, most wanted, doggonit you want it
He got it-type nigga 'round the town, town, town
Had he not played it so flashy, ashy when half of these niggas
Hurtin' and workin' would be he be found, found, found
In a ho (Ho) tel (Tel) room (Room) shot up (Shot up)
With his dick shoved in something he got a lot of
Bill Gates don't dangle diamonds in the face
Of peasants when he Microsoftening the place
You gettin' on my nerves, well I'm gettin' on your case
Consider your surroundings or you leave without a trace
'Cause they know where you live
And they've seen what ya drive
And they say they gonna put one in your helmet
'Cause you brag 'bout that watch
And all them things that you got
Them dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet

I know you got the biggest bankroll and you ballin
Follow the heater because the leader he is haulin'
Ass like Juan Valdez, I think he scared
Cause my nigga Khujo Goodie got that tooly to his head

Little did he know that, waitin in the closet
No matter what you call that, playboy sure got done

Gone was the one who came in contact
With those with slow goals who prompt to sell crack
On his megaphone, "hey look world I'm on" you off
He floss hard cause he celebrate the fact

Little did he know that, waitin in the closet
No matter what you call that, playboy sure got done
'Cause they know where you live
And they've seen what ya drive
And they say they gonna put one in your helmet
'Cause you brag 'bout that watch
And all them things that you got
Them dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet7Embed
