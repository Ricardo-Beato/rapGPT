11 ContributorsRecipe Lyrics
Yeah, I got the recipe
Nigga tryna eat
Tryna eat, nigga
I got the recipe, yeah
You know, I did that street thing
I came in the industry, nigga
I ain't ask them niggas to let me in the door
Kicked that mothafucka open, nigga, industry invasion

Show you how to sway that rice, I got that recipe
Who you think they got it from? I got that recipe
Hustlin' 101, I got that recipe
The one and only Young, I got that recipe
Uh, scale and the key, boil the right ingredients
So much paper, nigga, they gon' think you're readin' it
Me and Mike WiLL, we cook up on the spot, boy
You gon' need to stir it, no need for a top, boy, uh

I'm a hustler, I've been hustlin' my whole life
Like my Uncle Robbie, yeah he love to shoot dice
Nigga ever in doubt, I say the hustler's prayer
And it's so cold in my heart, it ain't nothin' there
All about the Benjamins, I'm screamin' like white
This for my niggas movin' wings like it's Popeye's
I just want a two door with some tan seats
Earring so big, look like a set of Beats
Yeah they thought that I was dead, I got nine lives
Pussy niggas want me dead, you had nine tries
Shit I'm smokin' so loud we call it ambulance
So many racks in my pocket, look like some Hammer pants, uh
Think it's sweet and clip be longer than a grapevine
Just know these niggas love money but they hate time
I'm connected in these streets just like wifi
Keep one eye off in these streets just like Fly Ty
You might also like
Show you how to sway that rice, I got that recipe
Who you think they got it from? I got that recipe
Hustlin' 101, I got that recipe
The one and only Young, I got that recipe
Uh, scale and the key, boil the right ingredients
So much paper, nigga, they gon' think you're readin' it
Me and Mike WiLL, we cook up on the spot, boy
You gon' need to stir it, no need for a top, boy, uh

If we talkin' 'bout them stamps, you know who be the champ
Tryna get that extra money so we sold 'em damp
Live the savage life, done made your boy a renegade
I've been ballin' all my life, I need some Gatorade
Bitch I seen my first mil' in the 10th grade
Just let me hide these Os, yeah you know the rent paid
They say I'm paranoid, I'm trustin' no one
That nigga Bobby tried to set me up in '01
Saw the red and blue lights, I had a hard nine
Thought I had a heart attack, but hey my heart fine
The way I talk that yayo shit, I know you like that
And when I talk that yayo shit, ain't gotta write that
Niggas on that monkey shit, I got the F&H
Keep it for that monkey shit and I ain't talkin' Bape
Draped up in this Valentino camouflage
War ready, I might paint the Bentley camouflage
Show you how to sway that rice, I got that recipe
Who you think they got it from? I got that recipe
Hustlin' 101, I got that recipe
The one and only Young, I got that recipe
Uh, scale and the key, boil the right ingredients
So much paper, nigga, they gon' think you're readin' it
Me and Mike WiLL, we cook up on the spot, boy
You gon' need to stir it, no need for a top, boy, uh

Yeah, I got it
One thing about me, nigga, if I say it it gon' check out, nigga
We been out here for decades
Shit don't stop
Nigga try to be what I was when I first came in the game, nigga
Fuck kinda shit that is, nigga?
Hustlin' backwards
Hustlin'
When I cook that shit up, I got that recipe
Chef Boyar-Young
I gets it done, nigga
Four, get you a nine
18 gets you 36
And bein' a real nigga gets you here
Solid... like a rock
Or a brick for that matter
Yeah
Want that recipe?
'Cause I got it1Embed
