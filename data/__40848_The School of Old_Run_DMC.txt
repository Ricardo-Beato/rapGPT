5 ContributorsThe School of Old Lyrics Now the things I do make me a star
And you can be too if you know who you are
 Like a Brougham on the corner, big boy in a car
Be the Kid in Kid Rock, with the baw-wit-da-baw
Be hard as law, what you saw is law
 Once again my friend, it's DJ Run on tour
 Like DJ Run's his name
 Like Kid Rock is his
 He's D.M.C. it's like that and that's the way it is
 Beats get you open my voice is just like a (HURRA)
Cane come invadin your statement and made a (TERROR)
Flows doin shows they knows I go (OVER)
 Hoes even chose to pose for this Rover
 Eyes come to see the three in live footage
Jay Run and D.M.C., that's what the hood is
 Never been a time like this that's so vital
 "I'm the King of Rock".. cause that's my title
 Then take a count, one two three
"Jam Master Jay, Run-D.M.C."

 want respect
 And if I'm correct
 Well then you're all like a call that I had checked
 And the shots that they take have no effect
 Some punk tried to dunk but he broke his neck
Cause I rock harder, and I roll farther
You wanna battle Kid Rock, bitch don't bother
 You waste your time, messin with my rhymes
 The only kick you'll get out of is in your behind
 Fire, blaze, my name is worldwide
When we yes yes y'all we rock it all night
 To other MC's doin rock'n'roll
It's Run-D.M.C., Kid Rock patrol
DJ Run 'til I'm done, D.M.C.'s the soul
Got MTV on remote control
Platinum platinum can't mess with gold
We never let go of the mics we hold
Our joints get played your select's the mode
D.M.C.'s spittin flame while your jams is cold
Over thirty-million records worldwide we sold
Darryl Mack, JMJ, and my name is Joe
The other MC's know about the show
Hook the turntables up to the telephone pole
Rock a rhyme nine nine 'til it's time to go
Cough up a long, DJ Run, got a rhyme to flow
I come from a school that they call the old
D.M.C. stands for Devestating Mic Control
I come from a school that they call the old
We never let go of the mics we hold
I come from a school that they call the old
Over thirty million records worldwide we sold
I come from a school that they call the old
It's Run-D.M.C., Kid Rock patrol
I come from a school that they call the old..
Dum diddy dum diddy diddy dumb dumb
 You see, I.. want respect
 and if I'm correct
 Well then you wall like a ball that I had checked
 And the shots that they take have no effect
 Some punk tried to dunk but he broke his neck
Cause I rock harder, and I grow farther
You wanna battle Kid Rock, bitch don't bother
 Don't waste your time, messin with my rhymes
 The only kick you'll get out of it IS IN YOUR BEHINDEmbed
