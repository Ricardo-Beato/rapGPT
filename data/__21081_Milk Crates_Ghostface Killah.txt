1 ContributorMilk Crates Lyrics"I've got the feeling.. I hear the sound"

Eh yo, I'm here to toast an MC like my name was Grand Puba
Run up in the large house and - throw out the Ruger
Some say I'm good - others pray - the want me to fall
Battle me - come one, come all - I leave ya jaw hangin'
New York City Slinger - Stark Nitty
I'm straight like a flat chester with some low titties
Plus my chain hangin' down to my dick
CB hits - grand on the hits - Star Trek VI
Black flicks - come on..
We fuck prostitutes - tie 'em to the bed
Throw 'em in the lasso - givin' me backstage hed
Picture me in Isreal sandles - Gucci open-toe
Book of Life - two on Camay - no H2O
Bandit - I'm like Moses - split the sea
Y'all split jeans - my last tape was the illy poster
Move crowds like the March of Dimes - fuck this rhyme..
*musical breakdown*
	"Up next.."

Walter in Dr. Jay's - rock the Jay's
Spot niggas with K's - son they feelin' your ways
It's like mayonaisse - old people love you - corns on their feet
Fifteen, twenty deep - you walked in, cross street
Walk under red light - sound went through Crown Heights
Even had 'em on bikes - they was startin' fights
New Years had 'em all drunk - lazy eye Milton
Found a bump - tried to buck and
Scotty snatched Janet's wig off that night
Shit got hectic - barber Jim fuckin' old man Chef
But God shit's real as a fuck
Throw a buck on Chuckle-Up - Thunderbird in cuffs
Skeeter with no teeth - night train lips
Beefin' with police - Grade-A inch knees
Duke blew a bag with him - he got butt-naked in the 'villes
Plus he fucked a whitey in the hill..
Throw a buck on Chuckle-Up - Thunderbird in cuffsYou might also likeEmbed
