5 ContributorsKervorkian Lyrics
Start a war on the poor, gettin' mad donations
Takin' cheese out of poor nations
Got Haitians still on sugar plantations
Wiped em out, called it exotic vacations
As you dig it, they set up regulations
Turn the rest of the world into cancer patients
What's the diff, no but's, and's, or if's
(Kervorkian, kervorkian)
Now I need a place to hide away
Are you ready, are you ready

Whose the real Doc's of Death?
Oh no it's Doctor Death!
Whose the real Doc's of Death?
Oh no it's Doctor Death!
Whose the real Doc's of Death?
Oh no it's Doctor Death!
Whose the real Doc's of Death?
Oh no it's Doctor Death!

Killer man, atomic B-boys in Japan
Another brother dies up in Sudan
Kevorkian, kervorkian
Got the heads lookin' for that kill 'em
Dead from the feds shit man
Contaminated in sad predicaments
Blood threats, blastin' continents
Kings, queens dead presidents
Can't tell me where my chiza went
Take em down blow the house down blaw
The evils got you wobblin' like weebles
Thinking you equal, killin lost peoples
No sequel, remember Biko
You might also like
Whose the real Doc's of Death?
Oh no it's Doctor Death!
Whose the real Doc's of Death?
Oh no it's Doctor Death!
Whose the real Doc's of Death?
Oh no it's Doctor Death!
Whose the real Doc's of Death?
Oh no it's Doctor Death!

Whose the real docs of death
Killin millions til they¹re last breath
Got no right to be dead ass wrong
Killin me softly with your songs

Bring the noise
But surrounded by cowboys
Indigenous but wiped out
Diggin new ditches
Can you dig it
Turnin tricks at the tip of politics
The devils slick, gettin their head split
I spit at those hypocrites
So i sticks to the music
Think about it it¹s god
You better get with the scene
Keep you and i from being human beings
You deserve what you deserve
If you believe what he believes
And into everything you leave
Oh what a tangled web you weave
When destroyed by the disease by 33 degrees
Bringing satan down to his kneesEmbed
