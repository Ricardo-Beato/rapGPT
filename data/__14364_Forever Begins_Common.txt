38 ContributorsForever Begins Lyrics

Victory won in a world of Hennessy and guns
Too young for the marches, but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles
We fought for ours, caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is
I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, do dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it

Living once again (Hey)
Living, then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living, then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living and then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living, then you're gone (Then you're gone)
You might also like
Ashes and snowfalls, I wonder when the roll call
For Heaven gon' come, forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes and say, "I'm never gon' run"
Sooner or later I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree, by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gangbang to maintain
'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the ride I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song

Living once again (Hey)
Living, then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living, then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living and then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living, then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living once again (Hey)
Living, then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living, then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living and then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Living, then you're gone (Then you're gone)
Ohh
Living, we're living
Then we're gone
Oh, living, then you're gone
You're gone, you're gone
Then you're gone
Ooh, gone

Origin is forever
Well, well, well, here we are back in the studio again
Look at that
I— hey, I don't need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin' up cue cards
What's that say— What that say?
Oh, they say, just talk, don't sing
Son, I bet you feel like you and I've been here forever, huh?
Through these old red eyes, beholding red eyes
I see my world's tears
Yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have two valleys
Hopeful eyes in the comfort
Of true protection and admiration of a child
That's forever
Forever is to strive
The pace of endearment
Forever
Forever is what I leave
My I-self contribution
Damn, what I'm gon' leave?
Okay, I'll leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand
To the universal scales of humanity, all humanity
Forever is finding a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, hurricanes following the trails of the African slave ships
War, war, and more war
Floods, Columbine, global warming, earthquakes
Another somebody done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech is not a, "Oh, what the heck?"
Which scale did you place your one grain of spiritual sand forever?
Confusion need a solution
Blend and stir, stir and blend the pot of humanity
Sift the ingredients
Of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atonement
We gon' work with the four A's here
Forever, Pops
Common good is forever
God's memory is forever2Embed
