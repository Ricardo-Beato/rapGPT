6 ContributorsThe Outcome Lyrics
New York lights to city streets
We don't sleep, we gon' eat
Whole team on the same shit as me
H-A-V-O in the place to be
 tell me what you see
Violator motherfuckers, niggas know
Know I handle business, keep my ducks in a row
Won't catch me out clubbin', we not partyin' about dough
Fuck all the small talk, that's for little niggas
We talkin' big money, yeah them big figures
Feelin' any kind of way then go ahead, steal, nigga
But 'fore you do it eat your fuckin' last meal nigga
'Cause it's gon be your last meal and that's real nigga
 behind me on the  nigga
So what's the deal nigga
Make it happen captain
You a Shook One, bitch when them things blastin'

Fuck what you heard, my mind is on money
Might crack a smile but ain't a thing funny
Caught up in the mix where your hands'll get muddy
Kill son, you ain't gon' take a thing from me
The outcome turn out lovely
But not for you buddy
Not for you homie
You don't want a problem that's not for you homie
You might also like
Of course nigga, fuck you thought nigga?
Do I look like a quitter?
I don't never give up
My blood'll spill everywhere 'fore a nigga stop
And I still'll be crawlin', fightin' to get up
By the sweat of my brow, I came too far
Dirty niggas wanted 2Pac me in the car
Pick me in the truck, 50 me in the van
Rest in peace Strech, nigga, E-Money Bags
I'ma show you how I get down, I'm waitin' on you niggas
You come  God, turn satan on you niggas
Caught up in the violence where my hands get bloody
I might crack a skull and find that shit funny
What bitch, fuck money, we get plenty of it
You should be more concerned with my respect and power
Listen, we tuck niggas in, he's gone, good night
Give a fuck about pain, that's all our life

Fuck what you heard, my mind is on money
Might crack a smile but ain't a thing funny
Caught up in the mix where your hands'll get muddy
Kill son, you ain't gon' take a thing from me
The outcome turn out lovely
But not for you buddy
Not for you homie
You don't want a problem that's not for you homieEmbed
