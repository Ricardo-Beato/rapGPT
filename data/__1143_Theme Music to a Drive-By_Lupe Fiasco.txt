No one does it better
(I said do it, do it) No one does it better
What down Charlie?
How you doing? Good, hey what up Joe?
I'm just chilling, know what I'm saying chilling, ain't nothing, yo
I said nah man, there's people out there better than me
I just do what I do, you know what I'm saying? Yeah aight

Uh, I can't feel a field nigga pain
Devious skill that make a strong willed nigga wane
Since a lil nigga hang with the killers and distributers of 'caine
They dismemberers of swishers then refill it with the Jane
Then they tilt it and they lit it with a flame
Then they took a pull of killer to the brain like (inhale noise) ah
Evil minded like Krang they became
They deranged like the Rover that I rode
That was the Range that I drove when I was a little bit older, mayne
Declaring war on the deck like they The Joker
All while, ducking from Bruce Wayne
While they polka with the devil in our moonlitten ghetto
Hello My Name stickers on the stickers of the veins
In rehab, remembering the feelings when they used to get mellow
When they was all back of a nickel like Monticello
When the underworld had to be smarter than Donatello
No honor amongst fellows
It's harder than sitting with a blind man and
Trying to describe yellow
Got me feeling like killer Joe
My life the album, know the classics by heart
And exactly how the filler go
Repeat it on my way to the liquor store, Charlie
You might also like
What's up, what's down what down
You know, how are you (..) what you in for? (..) stupid niggas
You know I'm sayin, it's why I do what I do
I be aight, we all be aight
We just gotta learn how to stay in our lane
And do what we know how to do, you know

'Cause, I can't feel the field nigga chains
Though I covet mine, so I covered mine in bling
Then I bumped into a bum and covered mine in shame
Then I bumped into a hun and uncovered mine again
Diamonds then under minded mayne
They give a nigga with no mack another kinda game
See money talks in another kinda slang
Detectives can't decipher as they listen through the wire
As I accept the call and listen to the lifer
Getting religion, making wudhu in the sink of your cell
Reciting Al-Fatiha in the kitchen
Indeed on his deen and in addition to doing dishes
Listen as I get schooled to the rules to rule
The fuel of fools, the obstacles, the cool
Had to slow it down homie
Chopped and screwed, he said blow it down for me
Sticks and stones make the homes
Only God's words can stop the wolves
And don't fraternize with pigs those kids'll think your stool
Not at the bar but trying to put him behind the bar like a bartender
He laid the law like the bar so I put it in a bar for dude
He said, borrow my jewels and bar the fools
'Cause they'll play ya like the space bar in Tools
Theme music to a drive-by, put it in your car and cruise, uh, uh7Embed
