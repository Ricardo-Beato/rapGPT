12 ContributorsI Ain’t Gonna Lie Lyrics
It's 50 nigga
I'm just gonna remind you
(I just wanna,) you shoe shining ass niggas
And your boy for me you niggas be in a train station
Now you niggas rap
Want a hand nigga mixtape
I'm why you hang nigga a mixtape
You punk your ass nigga
Don't give me your mother f*cking tape nigga

I could take you to dinner girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to a movie girl
But I ain’t gonna lie, I just wanna fuck you girl
Said I could take you shopping girl, but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Oh I could feel your head up girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

So many things I wanna show you girl
Succeed then I guess I owe you girl
Louie Vuitton movin on
For the sun comes up and the top comes down
Tryin to find out what the white royce with the voice about
What do I ..extra claiming
James brown doing like a sex machine
Got a hot real fetisch love this mean shit
Sex, drugs, rock’n’roll, Charlie Sheen bitch
See me zooted and booted on my Obama Shit
Money ain’t new telling how much I’ma get
I spit bars had a wood in the frenzy
Fuck around take a chain like Lindsey
Pop about taking pictures of my fendy
Catch me in Prada or maybe Escada
Just another beautiful day in LA
And I’m in New York a professional shit talk
And uh I see nigga is stressing
And I’m straight so I’m guessing
I’ma above to possesion
You might also like
I could take you to dinner girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to a movie girl
But I ain’t gonna lie, I just wanna fuck you girl
Said I could take you shopping girl, but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Oh I could feel your head up girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

You just take a little bit of my conversation when I talk
To make it clear for shawty I’m that nigga in New York
Shawty now lay down, put your head back
I put your legs back stroke and move your bed back
When we get to those back shots, shawty throw it back
When you back it up at me I like that
Let me guess I’ll turn you on, I’ll turn you on I bet
We just getting started in everything soaking wet
This pussy good she ain't worry about the rent this month
This pussy must have went and bought this bitch the bens up on front
For me is nothing I’m just f*cking for the fuck of it
But shawty acting like we just did another shit
It Can’t be it, it could be, okay maybe she’s good girl
Attracted to me and things from my world
Temptations are great when ..that will weight karrots ten times eight
I could take you to dinner girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to a movie girl
But I ain’t gonna lie, I just wanna fuck you girl
Said I could take you shopping girl, but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Oh I could feel your head up girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
