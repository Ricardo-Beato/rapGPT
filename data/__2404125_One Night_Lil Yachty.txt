I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice (All my ice)
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night (Just for the night)

I know you want this for life (No, you don't)
Fuck you so good you be calling out the Christ (Oh, my God)
Bottles of the Tech, got it laid on ice
We spent four seasons at the Four Seasons twice (Make it my home)
You be calling all your homegirls like, "I'm his wife"
Hell nah, you trippin', reevaluate your life
I can't love no bitch, every single ho is trife (Hell no)
I sip dirty Sprite just to get me through the night
But I need you there (Need you there)
Promise that I need you there
Ain't no other bitch gon' fuck me like you do, I swear
Put that on my gang, I swear
I just can't put you on front street like you want, I know
But baby, you is not no ho
And I put it on my gang, I'm not no average Joe (No average Joe)
It's Yachty from the block, you know (Yeah)
You might also like
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
Don't you tell no one
No, no, no, baby, don't you tell no one
We gon' keep this just between us, we gon' have some fun (Gon' have some fun)
Fuck until the morning come
When the morning come, I'll make you cum
But then then I gotta run
'Cause, baby, I got shit to do
Stack my bread up, fuck your head up
That's just what I'll do (That's what I'll do)
Chillin' on my avenue
If you ain't remember, I remember, girl
That's where I first met you
You had you a drink or two (You had a drink or two)
You came over half unsober callin' me your boo (Oh, no, no, no)
Then you turned around and fucked the crew (No, no, no, no, no)
I got no love for you
I can't have no wife, one night
You want this for life
But I can't, I can't have no wife
No wife, no, no wife (No wife)
Just one night, one night
I can't, can't have no wife (I can't, can't have no wife)
I know you want this for life
But I can't have no wife (No, no, no, no, no wife, no)
I just want you for one night

I just want you for one night
I know you want this for life, but no
No, no, no
I can't have no wife40Embed
