3 ContributorsBeen Around Tha World Lyrics
Yeah, this record is for my baby, my baby boo
I know I'm always on the road, I'm always gone
And you say I don't ever make records for you no mo'
Well this record is from me to you baby
Yeah, real talk

Been around the worrrrrld
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone

I seen everything twice
Been around the world I seen every scene twice
Stompin' down in Tokyo, dippin' in the rice
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every color dice
I do it big, fuck the rumors
Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Pumas
Gangstas don't die they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted my candy
I'm somethin' like Sammy
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammi
Sippin' Chardonnay, makin' bills on my hands-free
Father Hood, now the actors can't stand me
Cause I own rap and I'm comin' for your day job
Until then, I'm chillin' at the day spa
Relax my mind and just chill
Cause without you, none of this is real
Baby you know I
You might also like
Been around the worrrrrld
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone

Yeah, but now I'm back across the water
I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter
Blowin' sticky by the zips
And they can tell by how my rag hang, nigga this Crip
But I'm chillin'; it feels so good to get away
Especially when your name is D-O-double-Gizzee
Coast to coast jettin', man I been doin that
What y'all just start ballin' Cuz? I been up out the trap
Poppin' P's with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got an office
Dockin' down in Monaco, churchin' with my folks
Bad Lucc had me dyin' when he fell up out that boat
My life is like a movie
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
Then I relax and chill
Cause without you, none of this is real
Baby you know I

Been around the worrrrrld
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone
Been around the worrrrrld
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone
See you baby
Yeah I'm on my way home right now
I'm on my way right now!
I'm leavin' the studio right now
(None of them, none of them, yeahhhhhh)
Yeah, soon as I get home I'ma, I'ma go unplug it
Matter fact I ain't even gon' bring it in the house
See you in a minuteEmbed
