56 ContributorsI Donâ€™t Wanna Care Right Now Lyrics
I'm not a Turtle, I'm a turbo
Haters pray to god that I turn slow
Like I'm sipping on purple
But I ain't on your glow
I'm in a whole 'nother circle
Trying to keep it clean like church clothes
Said that respect was something had to work for
But that ain't gonna work though
Get your respect, but lose all my worth, no
You can dead that, get a hearse, go
Don't need 48 you'll find a killer in the first floor
It was me boy, to commercials
Feeling out of place like PETA at a fur store
So I left with a couple dozen fur coats
Said I could never break away from your hold
Watch me, turn though
Said that I blew it like Turquoise
Just mad hear it all in your word choice
Know it hurts but I really don't care though
Let me rub it in, get it all up in that ho

I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna, don't wanna right now (I don't wanna care right now)
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna, don't wanna right now (No I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't care now)

Oh-oh Go-Go-God over everything-thing
You fly but stars over everything-thing
And I'm one of them, yeah one of th-the-them
Oh I'm not o-o-one? Well I'm a hundred th-the-then
I'm a hundred mother loving stars
You're no lights, you're an undercover car
I'm an ambulance, and a fire truck, and some strobe lights, tied up!
Shining all in your eyes, all out of yours and all into mine
Lights and stars is all intertwined
And I'm feeling like Malcolm looking all out the blinds
Any means any means, and you can do anything anything
And the flow tight, skinny jeans skinny jeans
Hit you like Pacquiao, Philippines Philippines

I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna, don't wanna right now (I don't wanna care right now) (No I really don't care now)
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna, don't wanna right now (No I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't care now)

Ya'll know what I'm a let on
I'm Lupe, yes sir, who they
They yester, and I'm today, and tomorrow, hooray
Can I get a hip-hip for the new K-I-N-G, nigga I-AM-HE
Got the game in the clutch like Iron Sheik
You ball little boy, But I N-B-A
With a hand for the world, you a boy band with a dance and a twirl
I'm a rockstar with a band so thorough
Big ass tour bus that's jammed full of girls
T-t-tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof
T-t-tell em what it do, I don't care about your curfew
I'll tell you when I'm through boy
I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna, don't wanna right now (I don't wanna care right now) (No I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't care now)
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna, don't wanna right now (No I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't care now)

Tell em what it do, yell it from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
I don't wanna, I-I don't wanna, I-I-I don't wanna
C-c-c-care right, c-c-care right now
I don't wanna, I-I don't wanna, I-I-I don't wanna
C-c-c-care right, c-c-care right now7Embed
