4 ContributorsMake It All Better Again Lyrics
And ain't nobody seen him around anymore
Ever since she left it's like he doesn't even open the door
He'd rather be by himself anyways
In the comfort of his home and his video games
Until the break of dawn, early in the morning
Alarm clock sounding like Gabrielle's warning
Gotta get yours like there is no wrong way
The worm and the bird both worked a long day
And when he comes home afterwards
He looks back once more at the last chapter's words
To try to reinterpret exactly what he heard
When the universe collapsed and flattened the Earth
Pretend that you don't live in the past with us
Give the kids a reason to laugh at us
His heart's broken, but when he hears a car door closing
It gets him off the hardwood floor hoping

And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never gonna end
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
To find a place that we ain't never been
You might also likeMake it all better again

He so exhausted of mourning his losses
Doing his best just to cope with the process
A grown man can't depend on the promise
Plus you gotta be careful not to be too cautious, right?
Getting dumped ain't the worst that it gets, I guess
You could literally lose your breath
You could die in a fiery car crash underwater
And never understand why somebody doesn't want ya
And every night it's the same routine
Ever since you disappeared he just staring at a screen
A couple beers 'til he's light in the head
And then sleeping on the left side of the bed
Well everybody's waiting on some sort of return
Keep the honesty soft and the priorities firm
And even though you'll never ride a horseback through
He needs something to look forward to
Of course we do

And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never gonna end
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
To find a place that we ain't never been
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never gonna end
And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say
But I know you should probably come home today
So we can make it all better again
But it feels like it's never
Never never never never never never
Never never never never never never gonna end
Never
Make it all better again

And I don't care anymore
So maybe not so much on the verses
But the hook is there
The verses will be just kinda more like
You can flirt with it again right here1Embed
