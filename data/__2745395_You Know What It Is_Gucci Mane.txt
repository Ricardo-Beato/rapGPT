Hahaha

Huh, huh
Hahaha, nah, I really have something to say
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Man, y'all niggas can't fuck with us (Gangsta Grillz)

I’m infatuated, intrigued, in need of weed
My need for speed got me buying Lamborghini's
My taste in fashion got my body covered in G’s
My taste in trappin' got me sellin' kilos and P's (DJ Drama)
I’m infatuated, intrigued, in need of weed
My need for speed got me buying Lamborghini's
My taste in fashion got my body covered in G’s
My taste in trappin' got me sellin' kilos and P's (Gangsta Grillz)
I’m infatuated, intrigued, in need of weed
My need for speed got me buying Lamborghini's
My taste in fashion got my body covered in G’s
My taste in trappin' got me sellin' kilos and P's

I’m in Miami with a wife beater feeling the breeze
A wife beater but I'm unmarried lookin' for skeeze
You say you classy and sadity, I say bitch you a tease
And ain't no teasing Gucci Mane I need a girl that's freaky (Gucci Mane)
I drink my rosé out the bottle ain't no glasses for me
I give my girl a glass of champagne, she say ''Thank you Gucci''
I take her to the Gucci shop and she say ''Thank you daddy''
I tell her ''Baby girl, you welcome but it’s really nothin''

I think she want me and I’m feeling the same way
But shawty, bring your A game (Gangsta)
When you see a player rollin', money can’t be folded

And you know, you know, you know what it is, girl
You know what it is, girl
And you know, you know, you know what it is, girl

You know I know I’m your uno, you think I'm the shit, girl
Forty thousand dollar pilot, first class flight to Pittsburg
The way I direct shit, man, they think that I’m Steven Spielberg
Two-hundred-thousand dollar car so you know what it is, girl (You know what it is, girl)
Put a bowtie on a Bentley flying Spur and chauffeur (Chauffeur)
The best time of her life she ever had, I had to show her (Show her)
She want to get down low, down the floor but I am no golfer (No)
Fuckin' all these nurses but no I am not a doctor (Yeah)

I think she want me and I’m feeling the same way
But shawty, bring your A game
When you see a player rollin', money can’t be folded
I’m pretty sure you know what it is girl
And you know, you know, you know what it is, girl (Yeah, boy)
You know what it is, girl (Yeah, boy)
And you know, you know, you know what it is, girl (You know)
You know what it is, girl (J.O.C.)
You know what it is, girl
Candy coated birth, two inches off the ground (Wow)
Let your girl sing a song, (Let me lick you up and down)
The first time I seen it I was leaning off the lean
The diamonds gleaming start to thinking (Lil mama, you got me fiending)
Her pinky ring is looking like a bedrock
Said she wanna take some pictures, first lets take some head shots
And now she got her legs cocked, I’m beating up the juice box (Mo-more money make me cum)
Well Joc gon' make you cum non-stop (Non-stop)
I wanna fuck her with the lights on (On) all night long (Long)
To one of my songs (Songs), Let her keep my ice on (Ice)
Knock it up like Tyson, hit her with this python
Clap on clap off get you on my iPhone

I think she want me and I’m feeling the same way
But shawty, bring your A game
When you see a player rollin', money can’t be folded
I’m pretty sure you know what it is girl (Gangsta Grillz)
And you know, you know, you know what it is, girl (Talk about custody to these niggas)
You know what it is, girl (My builder trust niggas)
And you know, you know, you know what it is, girl (DJ the fuck Drama)
You know what it is, girl (Gangsta Grillz)
