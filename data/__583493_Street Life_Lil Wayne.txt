4 ContributorsStreet Life Lyrics
Comin' home when your Daddy go to work
Three phones and my pagers go berzerk
I'm talkin' birds like Dooney and Bourke
I'm talkin' work, enough to make you a clerk
Rubber bands, hard plates (what else?) big spoons
That whip got the plug out in mid June
Early July, I'm early like the bird that fly
Even Martin got a piece of that pie
I Eddie Murphy laugh at nigga, throw that piece in the sky
Drop the top on the Mercy, and bench streets with my tires
Make it dance like Percy, kids they on the sidewalk
Used to stash weed in my momma's Buick Skylark
I talk only full prices, negotiation
Rumination, fuck the police station
And if you got any association, then murder all close relation
Street life

Grocery bags on the counter, no grocery store
Couldn't fit a half a mil in the Gucci tote
Hit the lights, watch the roaches say "good night"
Stomp twice, say goodbye to the mice
Cook nice with a little bit of slice
And watch them dope fiends put that fire to that ice
Surely that dog's tail wag, it will bite
Man I'm just trynna get my scratch on these lice
When I was young, I had a flag on my bike
And then I went and got them mags on my bike
Momma don't wait up for me, I lost a bundle runnin' from the cops
Gotta get that makeup money, hey
I say I gotta get Nae-Nae lunch money
I say I gotta get Nae-Nae lunch money
It's Hollygrove till they bury me cold
Who's to say if they gon' bury me old?
I live that street life
You might also like
Back to the struggle, born trouble
Like trynna find strength in a torn muscle
Young as scum, Daddy gone
But youngin' run the streets till he pull the gun
Pull they arm, all-all black hoodie on
Talibon strapped with the gat like a bomb
Red storm, handkerchief head on
Fuck around and them bees swarm, be calm
Better know what street you on
Don't you come on Eagle, are you Evel Knievel?
Crackheads got pipes and pistols
Now run up on that crackhead and fight the pistol
This is the street, nigga eat
Where the birds don't tweet, the birds go cheap
And niggas don't sleep, you may have heard of MLK
But I know a gang of niggas with they own street
Street lifeEmbed
