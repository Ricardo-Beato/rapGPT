45 ContributorsRarri Lyrics
Southside

Got a 'Rari with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I cannot be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack  (Bratt, bratt)
I just finished doin' some business with the hat back
I'ma take a nigga head like a snap back
I'ma hit her with this wood, no mousetrap
Take a five-hour rest, ball it catnap

Treat her like a Bentley, take the top up off that bitch
I got hoes drinkin' syrup like a waffle on that dick
I made all my pockets grow like Pinocchio, lil' bitch
Either way, money'll grow, just know I'm tryna get rich
Baby, I wanna cash out on you in it for my pride
Baby, I bought a Audi and I gave it to my mother
These niggas, they cowards, they won't even kill each other
Even though I got rhymes, I bust shit just like a bubble
Hey I ran up my racks and Iâ€™m killin' 'em by the day
Treat her like she got tatted, she covered with Olay
Not a big fan of acne, but she like it in her face
I'm in the West Coast bangin' like I'm in the A

Got a 'Rari with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I cannot be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack (Bratt, bratt)
I just finished doin' business with the hat back
I'ma take a nigga head like a snap back
I'ma hit her with this wood, no mousetrap
Take a five-hour rest, ball it catnap

I just copped the coupe, it came with twin turbo (Rrr!)
Diamonds 'round my neck, they singin' like they Kirko (Ooh)
Thugger got me swung, got drinkin' all this purple (Act')
And I got them billionaires in my circle (Yeah)
So you know I'm thinkin' 'bout coppin' a 'Rari ('Rari)
I got old money like when I played Atari (Racks)
Counted me a million on my DVD (For real)
Coca, cocaina, I got recipes (For real)
Really makin' juggs, I was servin' (Servin')
Cash Money nigga, I know Birdman (Stunna)
I just want the cheddar, I just want the pesos (Racks)
Rich Gang, YSL, came up off that yayo (Crack)

Got a 'Rari with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I cannot be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack (Bratt, bratt)
I just finished doin' business with the hat back
I'ma take a nigga head like a snap back
I'ma hit her with this wood, no mousetrap
Take a five-hour rest, ball it catnap9Embed
