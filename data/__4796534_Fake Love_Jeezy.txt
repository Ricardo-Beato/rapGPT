8 ContributorsFake Love Lyrics
Yeah
Swear to God, nigga
(This one hit close to home, man) You can keep the fake love 'cause I don't need it
I don't need it
Praying on my downfall, don't receive it

It's fake love
(One thing about it, it's one thing a nigga can't stand is that)
Is fake love
(Said he was my dawg, said he'd always be my man, but look)
Why I feel like this?
(Why I feel like this, nigga?
I know I ain't wrong though, I can't be)
It's fake love (Fake love, nigga)
(Huh? Yeah
Integrity is free, nigga, all that fuck shit cost you somethin', uh)

Said he'd never switch up on me, that nigga lied
Not my round, never my dawg, I almost died
Money made these motherfuckers crazy
Obligations made these motherfuckers lazy
Ain't shit funny, all joke jokes aside
Cuban Gooding Jr., let him out, he ain't tryna ride (Step out the car)
Watched me work my fingers to the pole (Just sat there and watched me)
Even let him stay off in my home (For real though, huh)
You's a real nigga 'til you tell a nigga no (No)
You's a ho nigga, let them niggas tell it though (Damn)
Fuck niggas (Niggas), bitches too (Too)
Before I chase you, I'll chase these riches boo (Straight up, uh)
You ain't got a loyal bone in your body (Not at all)
Probably fuckin' five niggas in this party (Maybe six)
Can't trust you, you can't trust yourself (Nope)
Need a boss bitch, you probably fucked the help (Woo)
And I ain't never asked the man for a thing (Never)
'Cept some Tylenol to help a nigga with the pain (Shit)
Shit, I'm all in (In), I'm goin' all out (Swear to God)
They only come around when you ball out (What's up? Yeah)
You might also like
It's fake love
(That a nigga can't stand)
Is fake love
(One thing about it, he said he'd always be my man, what's up? Yeah)
Why I feel like this?
(Huh, what's up?)
It's fake love
(It's that fake love, nigga, keep that shit to yourself, let's go)

Yeah, said I'm all in (In), I'm going all out (Oh my God)
They only come around when you ball out (Swish)
Paper fucked up, doubts in my head (Fucked up, nigga)
That's when my main man left me for dead (Damn)
All the shit I did, all the shit I done (All the shit I done, nigga)
Now your lazy ass wanna try to run (For real)
I ain't even trip, I just ran it up (What I did, nigga)
Niggas steady bitchin', I be mannin' up
I fed niggas (Fed niggas), I led niggas (Yeah)
Then your dawgs won't help you pull the sled, nigga (Yeah)
Took 'em 'round the world (World), even gave 'em ice (Ice)
Like Keith Sweat, somethin', somethin', somethin' just ain't right

It's fake love
(I said it's one thing about it, it's one a nigga can't stand is that)
Is fake love
(Nigga said he was my dawg, said he'd always be a nigga, man, but, ayy)
Why I feel like this? (That's just what it is, you know? Yeah, yeah)
It's fake love (It's that fake love, nigga)
You know, one thing about it, nigga, I was sittin' up in that cell
I ain't ask a motherfucker for shit
Ain't nobody go spend on a nigga
Ain't nobody check on my kids
Ain't nobody call my mama
Ain't nobody hit my sister
I done paid my niggas' funerals and all
I don't want shit back, on bro, can say it like this
All that fake love, you can keep that shit
I don't need it, I don't want it
I don't desire it, don't ask for it, man
On ten toes, nigga
I'ma keep it goin', I'ma live the dream, nigga
How 'bout that?1Embed
