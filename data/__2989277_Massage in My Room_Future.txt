37 ContributorsMassage in My Room Lyrics
I hate if you love her, I'm gon' fuck her
Five plain watches in my duffle
I got 20 freaks in my room
I got 20 freaks in my room
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
I just went skiing with a bad bitch
I spent 20,000 on a jacket
I bought all the hitters some more ratchets

I just took a meeting out in Aspen
You get out of line, it's gon' be drastic
Pay my dawg a Perc, it made him happy
Put you in a hearse like an assassin
Runnin' through the game in some Ballys
I just want the green like Aladdin
She kept it low-key, I was straddlin'
I gave her more wood than a cabin

I hate if you love her, I'm gon' fuck her
Five plain watches in my duffle
I got 20 freaks in my room
I got 20 freaks in my room
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
I just went skiing with a bad bitch
I spent 20,000 on a jacket
I bought all the hitters some more ratchets

20 freaks at the embassy
I just pissed on a 100 Gs
Ace of Spades when the lights off
Wrist movin' like CB
Bought the Lamb' for the energy
Got your main at Top Golf
Check, check on me, roger that
Draco on me', roger that
Lean on me, roger that
Check on me, roger that, check
Check the work, 10-4
Codeine, indo
Wrist cost a Bentley truck...
Wrist cost a Bentley truck
Had drugs on me, lot of red
Then I hit the globe, a lot of red
Copped a speedboat and docked it
Left-overs in my pocket
I'ma take off like a rocket
I'ma hold this money hostage

I hate if you love her, I'm gon' fuck her
Five plain watches in my duffle
I got 20 freaks in my room
I got 20 freaks in my room
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
I just went skiing with a bad bitch
I spent 20,000 on a jacket
I bought all the hitters some more ratchets
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
While I'm gettin' a massage in my room
I just went skiing with a bad bitch
I bought all the hitters some more ratchets2Embed
