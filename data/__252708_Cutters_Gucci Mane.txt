15 ContributorsCutters Lyrics
Y'all niggas is some peep squeaks, pewees
Little league JV
We ball, B ball
Your small ball, T-ball
Pissy yellow jewelry, pussy don't piss me off
Severe nigga head off, cut nigga feet off
I'm wrote on like a dictionary when I take my shirt off
Down with the A-Team, Mr-T and Murdock
I'm the owner and star player nigga don't make me pull a hole out
I'm the MVP in new Lebron's, Zaytoven bring the Mo out
One championship pinky ring and this fire here won't go out
Grab my shotgun, all you hoods pink
You think I'm doing it to get out
Run with my little bad bitch in my Bentley whip my dick out
R.I.P. to double D but try Gucci, I'll pull the stick out

2 AK's, that's a hundred shots (cutters cutters)
Cinnamon roll drums, they shoot honey buns (cutters cutters)
My AR – it got monkey nuts (cutters cutters)
Man 4-5 – that's her Berkin clutch (cutters cutters)
Man this Mack-90 could flip a truck (cutters cutters)
Five crystal fingers and they blow you up (cutters cutters)
We gonna be OG's when we's growing up (cutters cutters)
Now them OG's ain't even tough as us (cutters cutters)

I'm fucking R&B hoes nigga the rest of these year
And I ain't wrong none of them ho cause ain't none of them shit
It ain't a nigga I ain't done shot at nigga that ain't hit
It ain't a nigga that done lived to say took my shit
I'm tired of the motherfuckers asking, "Why I ain't at the awards"
Cause I ain't trying to be around that many pussies at once
Plus they searching at the door which means that I ain't gone
If I can't get in with the Glock homie, then I ain't showing
Guwop hit me and he told me that he need me on a song
I told him if he putting a fuck nigga on it don't send me the song
Everybody claim real 'til the weapons in drawn
And when them cutters come out, that when the bitch go to showing

2 AK's, that's a hundred shots (cutters cutters)
Cinnamon roll drums, they shoot honey buns (cutters cutters)
My AR – it got monkey nuts (cutters cutters)
Man 4-5 – that's her Berkin clutch (cutters cutters)
Man this mack-90 could flip a truck (cutters cutters)
Five crystal fingers and they blow you up (cutters cutters)
We wanted to be OG's when we's growing up (cutters cutters)
Now them OG's ain't even tough as us (cutters cutters)Embed
