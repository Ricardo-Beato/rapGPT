And I get my shirts clean
I don't iron what I earn (Yeah)
When niggas take shots it's like they aiming up
Baby know a gangsta need a hug (Ayy, yeah)
Walked up in the club and through a dub (Uh, yeah)
Niggas went and bought ice and have it on tucked
Niggas get to pointing fingers get in front of the judge (Uh, yeah)
The system ain't gone show a nigga no love (Yeah)
That's why I walk in court, all iced up
You got ice too
Welcome to the ice club (Ayy, ayy)
Bullets get to flying like ice pucks (Ayy)
In 6th grade, I got hella write-ups
Keeping it real hefty
Would you tell me if you smell me
I know I got a problem can you help me
Help me (Ayy), can you tell me
If I had to go away, would you wait on me
Do they hate on me, yeah
Do I give a fuck, not really
Seats raspberry
Ion't trust myself, I only trust my fucking family
And my casualties
Sitting at the spot
All this gelato, got a cavity
Gotta celery salary
Finna bury my sins under the motherfucking apple tree
Ain't finna make something wrong with me
I ain't hitting the blunt that you motherfucker pass to me
For those who judge me off my skin
I'm young, rich, and black and I'm motherfucking proud to be
