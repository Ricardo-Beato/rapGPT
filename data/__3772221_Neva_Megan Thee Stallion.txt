LilJuMadeDisBeat, ayy

Never let a broke nigga sex me (Never)
Never let no ho test me (Never)
Never been scared of the money (Never)
Never let em take nothin' from me (Uh-uh), ayy
Never ever, never ever, ever
A nigga get read like a letter, huh
She think she bad but I'm better, huh
These bitches tryna play catch up, ah
Never let a broke nigga sex me (Never)
Never let no ho test me (Never)
Never been scared of the money (Never)
Never let em take nothin' from me, ah
Never ever, ever, ever, ever
A nigga get read like a letter, huh
She think she bad but I'm better, huh
These bitches tryna play catch up, ah

Shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
Put yo' head down when you talk to a pimp (Be quiet)
'Scuse me, I got some big racks in my purse
And right now, they just makin' me walk with a limp
Huh, ballers be showing me love, ayy
I bear with these bitches, they cubs, huh
I put her on in the club, ayy
Then she come bring me my cut (Come here)
Shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil nigga (Be quiet)
Huh, fuck is you goin' through?
I can tell these bitches spoil you
But I'm a player so I see the toy in you
He tryna act like he tough, ha
Boy, I'm callin' your bluff, ayy (Callin' your bluff)
He tellin' me what he not gon' do
Wait a minute, first of all, who is you talkin' to? (Ayy)

You ain't savin' hoes, I ain't savin' niggas either, huh
Don't try to tell me you real
Blow up my phone and you don't pay the bill (Uh-uh)
Ain't got no money and stay tryna chill
Hell nah, fuck that shit
Do what I say or go get a new bitch
You know I mean what I say when I say it
I hate a nigga that's always complaining
Hop off, the top off a bitch like a genie
I'll turn her color to purple like Celie
I'm turnin' into a monster, unleash me
Bitch, you know better be cool when you see me, huh
They want me outta my character (Uh-uh)
Lately, I been in my act
I'll take your boo and I won't give him back
I'll wrap my legs round his head like a trap (Ah)
Never let a broke nigga sex me (Never)
Never let no ho test me (Never)
Never been scared of the money (Never)
Never let em take nothin' from me (Uh-uh), ayy
Never ever, never ever, ever

These bitches tryna play catch up, ah
Never let a broke nigga sex me (Never)
Never let no ho test me (Never)
Never been scared of the money (Never)
Never let em take nothin' from me, ah
Never ever, ever, ever, ever

She think she bad but I'm better, huh
These bitches tryna play catch up, ah4Embed
