Look, picture me rollin', tippin' my chaueffer
Niggas look jealous, you gotta control it
Reachin' my quota, mixin' my soda
Feeling connected to God, tryna' get closer
Steppin' on roaches
Me and my locsters
Just tryna get over, tryna not get swallowed by locusts
Tryna' to stay focus, kinda like Moses
Like somebody chose us, this weight on my shoulder
I feel these emotions, but still I keep going
A pen to a poet
I been through the motions
I’m feeling heroic
But life is a dice game
And they dare you to blow it
You might get a stripe man, but that ain't gon' pay for the strollers
It's never enough to console her
Telling your daddy's a soldier
She needs you right now in this moment
Not dead on your back pushing roses
To me I'm just carving this sculpture
Fine-tuning my approaches
Doubling back as a owner
The moment of truth is upon us
Call the promoters
You might also like
Picture me rollin' rollin' rollin'
Me and my friends not worried
Then we get stopped by the police
Gotta make it home to my baby
Cause these days niggas goin' crazy
Gotta make it home to my baby
Cause this is they say me
Gotta make it home to my baby, hol' up, yeah
Look I bet I'ma make it home to my baby (bang bang)
Yeah, I bet I'ma make it home to my baby
I said, I bet I'ma make it home to you, baby4Embed
