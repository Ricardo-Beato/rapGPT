23 ContributorsI Donâ€™t Love Her Lyrics
I love things about her
I love the way she treat me
I love the way she fuck me
I love the way she suck me
I love things about her
I love the way she treat me
I love the way she fuck me (It's Gucci)
I love the way she suck me (It's Gucci goin' in), ayy (Go)

I'm a trapaholic, all I do is ball
Tear the mall down now, trick, don't flag me down (It's Gucci)
See me downtown, 'Rari (Skrrt), I didn't mean to shit on you
Excuse me, sorry, verse so slick, make my video marvelous
Polo to the floor, Ralph'd down like Carlton
Try the CEO, they gon' put you on a carton (Carton)
I didn't mean no harm, but my diamonds are dumb (Bling, bling)
Plenty of rocks on my arm (Brr, brr)
Me and Rocko the Don, East Atlanta the Slum
Where I'm from, we got a gun, in the club havin' fun (It's Gucci)
And after it's done, no more coaches to call it (Yeah)
After party, bachelor party, they shoulda called it (It's Gucci)

I love things about her (But I don't love her, huh)
I love the way she treat me (But I don't love her, no)
I love the way she fuck me (But I don't love her, huh)
I love the way she suck me (Still don't love her, ayy)
I love things about her (But I don't love her, huh)
I love the way she treat me (But I don't love her, no)
I love the way she fuck me (But I don't love her, huh)
I love the way she suck me (Still don't love her, ayy, no)

All the busters'll sweat her, only ballers can get her
She a flipper, I love how she do whatever I tell her
Yeah, I like her a lot, but still, I don't love her at all
I hate pussy-ass niggas, and I'm in love with the mall (Mall)
I got a crush on white diamonds and I got a thing for that kush
That Sour Diesel my favorite, you better watch how you look (Yeah)
Quick to take your lil' diva, then treat that ho like a slut
She was suckin' on Gucci, I had my dick in her butt
You know I'm bad bitch crazy, one-eighty-seven's my favorite
Infatuated with money, free Boosie-Boo, the streets waiting
I love things about her (But I don't love her, huh)
