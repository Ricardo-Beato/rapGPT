128 ContributorsCole Summer Lyrics
Love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
It's only what you got in the form of the highest power you seek
Now this right here's not a preview
I need to let it go
Yeah

Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nuttin' like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
'Member MTV Diary? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve and I bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!"
Ms. Hill, please don't sue me
'Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he throwin' 50
Lord, forgive me, bitches saying, "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'posed to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'posed to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my momma in that E-Class, nigga
And I told her quit her job but hold your horses
If my next album flop it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me
You might also like
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go, uh
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
'Cause nothing even matters...

Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them '90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch with a few kids
The pussy loose but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma, 'cause really I
Just a born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
'Cause I'm fin' ta drop knowledge like a Five Percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg, nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met Pac and said "I'm down witcha"
And when they wasn't writin' rhymes they fuckin' line sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Every time I drop I get the net poppin' like LeBron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long-winded
Let me switch it now, back to Hell's Kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with StarGate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dummies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets but nigga, that ain't really where they were, actin' just like Dede was
But who am I to judge? That's neither here nor there
Just know I know, my nigga, I just like being aware
If I had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera
At the same time and put name tags on they titties
So I donâ€™t get they names wrong, screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now, five days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from samplin' now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June'll make four years since I gave you my number
The Warm Up dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas I dropped Friday Night Lights
In the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer, but the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me
I can't let it go
I can't let it go, nah
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
They say I need to let it go
'Cause nothing even matters, ayy

Yeah
