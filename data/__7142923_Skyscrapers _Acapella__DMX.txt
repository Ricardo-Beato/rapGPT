3 ContributorsSkyscrapers (Acapella) Lyrics
Ah (Right), ah
It's time for us to reach for the stars (Grr)
Talk to 'em

I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What began as a seed is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers

Whenever I went through something, it brought me closer to God (Come on)
And I stayed in somethin', so now I'm closer to God (Come on), but
Close to his heart 'til the attacks get stronger (Uh-huh)
Become much harder to fight and they last longer (Yeah)
That's what it's always been, joy with the pain (Ooh)
Dark with the light (Ooh), sun with the rain (What?), but
With the right perspective there's somethin' to gain
Look for the good in the bad, like the sun when it rains

I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What began as a seed is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers
You might also like
I don't like better, better get you comfortable (Uh-huh)
Comfort puts you to sleep, need to know what's up with you (What?)
Hate and love relationship, but what I love (Yeah)
Hate it because it kills me, love it for what it does (Why?)
Every day I live (Ugh), every day I die (Ugh)
Don't always laugh (Ugh), but every day I cry (What?)
Used to wonder why, now I enjoy the rain (Ahh)
Get stronger with the struggle, can't live without the pain (What?)
I just wanna be heard, fuck the fame (Yeah)
My words will live forever (Come on), fuck my name
Father God, please give me the strength I need
I was born in the dirt, so it's like you planted the seed, let me grow

I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What began as a seed is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers

Put your hands high and touch the sky (Huh, huh, huh)
Put your hands high and touch the skyscrapers
Put your hands high and touch the sky (Huh, huh, huh)
Put your hands high and touch the skyscrapers (Rrr)
Breezes in the summer comet sky
And jungle city lights go flashing by
Feel full ofâ€”
Feel full, full
Reach for the sky (Ooh, yeah)
Reach for the sky
Reach for the sky (Ooh, yeah)
Reach for the sky
Reach for the sky
The sky ain't gon' hold you
The sky is not gon' hold youEmbed
