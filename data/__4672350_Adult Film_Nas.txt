30 ContributorsAdult Film Lyrics
R-A-W
R-A-W

Fuck outta here, second guessin' our love
Dick Tracy, detective, inspectin' hoes need a hug
You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club
Get a cookbook, you gossipin', watchin' hip-hop and love, uh

I don't mean to be brass, even a genius asks questions in class
Supposed to know a love that'll last
Her friends say "Don't mess with rappers", correction
I'm Akhenaten, King Tut's predecessor
I fantasize, and no mind him, I'm slick with words
Tell your girlfriend I flip the birds
She don't know shit, I am your neighbor
Brother, homie, love, a friend to smoke with
I want us to take road trips, fuck that low shit
I'm on some more 'everybody-should-know' shit
Or let's be real discreet
Everybody lies, not everybody Nas
So your friend might hate (Ayy)
When was the last time her and a man was straight? (Ayy)
Just chill, light bulbs dim (Ayy)
You are my adult film
You might also like
Life begins right now
Life begins right now (My adult film)
Life begins right now (My adult film)
Life begins right now (R-A-W)
No matter what they say (You are, you are, my adult film)
Life begins right now (You my, you my, R-A-W)
Life begins right now
Life begins right now

Fuck outta here, second guessin' our love (Hey)
Dick Tracy, detective, inspectin' hoes need a hug
You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club (Hey)
Then pick a good book, so we can both get our knowledge up, uh-huh

Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
No matter what they say
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
You start to get comfortable after you get it right
Yeah, you start to get comfortable after you get it right

Misogynistic monologue what we dialogue
Yeah, I'm mature from the chest, and higher North
But below the waist, I'm a dog
Your girl in heat like cayenne sauce
She so sweet, but she kinda lost
Like me, African name with a diamond cross
But you a strong, stand-tall soldier
They lean on you, expecting you not to fall over
Like you never feel pressure, like you made of steel
So I absorb your pain, I like to see you chill
Eight millimeter cinematic celluloid
I see us both, little girl, little boy
Explorin' the world, similar, virgins became experienced
We both like it in front of mirrors, and this shit start weighin' on me
Feel your good vibes layin' on me
When them light bulbs dim
Lemme watch you, my adult film

Life begins right now
Life begins right now (My adult film)
Life begins right now (My adult film)
Life begins right now (R-A-W)
No matter what they say (You are, you are, my adult film)
Life begins right now (You my, you my, R-A-W)
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Fuck outta here second guessin' our love (Hey)
Dick Tracy, detective, inspectin' hoes need a hug
You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club (Hey)
Then pick a good book, so we can both get our knowledge up, uh-huh

Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
No matter what they say
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Life begins right now
Hey
