9 ContributorsGold Digger (AOL Sessions) Lyrics
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke, broke, uh
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke ni**as, uh

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head
(Yeah, she gives me money)

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm
And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
I gotta take all they bad a** to ShowBiz
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, we all got up in
They all went to din and then I had to pay
If you f***in' with this girl then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to f*** with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her
You might also like
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke ni**as, uh

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head
(Yeah, she gives me money)

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of yo' kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
Baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money
Uh, if you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup" (We want prenup!)
Yeah, it's something that you need to have
When she leave your a**, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on her eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his?
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke ni**as, uh
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke ni**as, uh

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head
(Yeah, she gives me money)

Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, he can't buy weed
You got out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, you gotta roll up ya sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know there's dude's ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And y'all gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' a** for a white girl
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head
(Yeah, she gives me money)

And that is the story of the gold diggers, boys and girlsEmbed
