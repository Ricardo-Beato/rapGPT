Main line, underneath the skin of the grapevines
Save time, serpent, no need to hiss
Found a reason to live, doubt could be an abyss
Keep fallacies off your lips, see casualties in the wind
Uh, we gatherin' in remembrance
Galaxy's the distance between us by Christmas
Now we crumblin', leaf over tree pre-twist (I bet)
Your heart skip a beat when you see me next
We stretch harshly, I see y'all weed stretched (Stretched)
Parsley in your B, we hard to get involved with
In the blisterin' cold, watchin' Harder They Come
Harder they fall, I figured niggas was bold
They proved me wrong quick
Long trip, siftin' through memories over dumb spliffs
Young man, flung soliloquy off the tongue-tip, uh
Uh, uh (Worth it)You might also like9Embed
