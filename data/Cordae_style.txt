I don't know no no

Now let me tell you bout this rap nigga who would never blow
He got all the fucking talent, yeah the kid is hella dope
Couldn't see through all phonies, should've bought a telescope
He was aiming too high so he had to settle low
Shopping label after label, never signed him a deal
And you know I'm so retarded, couldn't find the appeal
Didn't matter 'bout the work or how he rhyming with skills
Just another young nigga tryna grind for the bills
I mean I never was too tall or skilled to go shoot ball
I know I'ma move far, but dammit it's too hard
Imagined if you starved, but dreaming of shoes, cars
And everyone around you is just wishing that you'd fall
But nah I refuse
See a nigga came to carry a mission
People all from different places come with varied intentions
I'm a great and I knew that from the very beginning
But barely ambitious, not to mention the Larry I'm piffin
Ain't no friends, people wanna see you buried in prison
Me and all these others rappers, man it's scary the difference
I'm too ahead
Plus I always kill tracks and I shoot 'em dead
The difference is blue and red and I never salute the Feds
'Cause the systems so corrupted, they just after the loot and bread
I rather just lose my head, think what pastor would do instead
My guidance when I'm arriving, through all of the flashing lights and
Love for the passion writing, but dying a crashing Viking
But yeah

Oh, what a wonderful feeling
It's such a wonderful feeling
They never love you for real
Keep it subtle and chill
On my way to top about the bundles and mills

I'm thinking back to into a time before my life was obscene
At times I be the only enemy just fighting my dreams
This rap shit is whole my life, it's like a pipe to a fiend
Or better yet, no metaphor, it's like a mic to a me
I reminisce my childhood and I ride my bike in the street
And we go straight to Marcus house he get to slicing a beat
And we was in school till 2, but shit, was writing by 3
But that was back when it was fun, it was enticing at least
And then I almost lost it all, used to cry in my sleep
And lay awake and always pray something the righteous could beat
Take me back to the days when I used to work at the mall
Take me back to the days when I wasn't perfect at all
And when you climbing from the bottom, it never hurts when you fall
Got some problems I been hiding but I'm working to solve
Don't let me blow and realize it wasn't worth the recall
I lay a verse and into the earth, pop a perk till I'm off2Embed
Hideaway, hideaway
Man, this shit - this shit is history, man

Yeah, I come from a different breed, got a different approach
'Cause what's life without grind and you living for hope
But man these kids be like nine and they hitting the dope
And so we fall into the plan, they consider us jokes
These all true facts but damn, you knew that
I mean I flew back to the city to drop a new track
I'm so anxious, but the listeners be so brainless
Keep your stupid ass opinion up your anus
You get the method, they catching bullets like interceptions
Rest in peace King Steelo, man, this shit a lesson
'Cause kids don't play tag, they got a Smith & Wesson
They quick to shoot your ass up if you disrespecting
And then crips, bloods, and pyru's pull up with 5 dudes
Come snatch your fly shoes, reminiscing high school
I've never been to one to hideaway confrontation
Especially from these bum rappers who not as patient
Amazing that they blow up, my time will come soon
We different like the ying-yang or the Sun moon
Braggin' 'bout your cheap chains, like you dumb coon
White folks mad see our posters on his son room
And we got 'em so scared we compelling the youth
They attracted to my music, I'm telling the truth
Roomate saying "Nigga, nobody better than you"
I swear he'd never lie 'cause we move like a veteran movin'

I can't wait for the years where I'm better than Jay

Flippin' stocks, show these niggas I'm clever with ways
Will flip a beat till misery, this shit is history
That's word to legend Tye Tribbett, I got the victory
Your shit is weak, that's a known fact, no mystery
I blow up and 'sho 'nuff it's meant to be
Visions of future, I'm timid with Luther
Nailing notes to my wall, fuck we posing and ball
All this explosion I caused how cause the emotion raw
Feds is imposing the law, killing us choking us all
Now they unloading the dogs, tempers is rising
Oh, you done started something, you know niggas be violent
You done gave us reason, now we major, we bleeding
On the crip of the evening, come equipped with a deacon
Because prayer is needed, they got a layer defeated
But we just busting through, nigga, that's up to you
I learned knowledge through experience, we say "Fuck the schools"
I pop a pill like I'm Bill but I'm no Huxtable
And I'll never run away, nigga1Embed
Wished I had told ooh was only one
But it's too late
Aww, it's never too late
It's too late,  never

Need this song to blow up and get plays fast
Just look at where my grandmama stay at
Graduating school, see the debt I gotta pay backing
My money looking rocky, I need some more of it ASAP
So here's the tape all a nigga fucking working on
That's why all my verses long 'cause the hurt is strong
I told 'em I was the greatest and not a word was wrong
I'm was searching for my purpose and I murdered songs
What's the verdict? Minds lurking, that's the herb I'm on
Everybody call my line with alerted tones
Rappers don't want beef, eat that sirloin
What's at stake is my fate and my verbal thrown
No pun intended, a nigga I was born a run this business
Account balance is always saying my funds are suspended
I'm tryna buy a beach invited tons of women
Dive in the water slide, ain't no fun in swimming
You should know they from exotic places
Black and white girls, man, I'm not a racist
The house so big couldn't find the basement
We tryna move up but we climb adjacent
Now presently these goals is just manifested
'Cause right now pockets looking anorexic
People hating on the grind and I can't respect it
Gotta vision for the future, damn my plans is hectic, nigga

I go off, fasho boss, y'all so soft
I underrated and undefeated, got no loss
I'm colder than February and snow with 11 flurries
But my life's in a golden state like I'm Stephen Curry
Told momma I'm blowing up so she never worry
And to the haters that's plotting on me, be dead and buried
My second tape, I elevate, see better days
Forever paid, I'm here now y'all never stay
A real nigga, no Hilfiger, my bills bigger
The same people that chill with you will kill quicker
I seen it happen, hurricanes and FEMA laughing
A leader passing, say nothing a just feed the madness
A bleeding passion metaphors for me with rapping
Hip-hop is so dead, just clean the ashes
The sweetest fashion, man, I'm flyer than three Aladdin's
On the carpet with a Jasmine, she the baddest1Embed

Nigga, I spit that fire, the third degree
All these rapper be liars, they purpin' B
I stay humble and kill it, that's word to Reek
Ayy, I spit that raw shit, you should be cautious
Flow is sick, leave it you nauseous, ayy
I do this often, you niggas soften, lyrics put 'em in coffin, ayy
Hit them like I'm Kenny Lofton
Run the game, niggas crawling
My bank be calling me artist (Why?)
'Cause all I'm doing is withdrawing (Damn)
Hit the plug, lemme hold a pound
He just front me 'cause he know the sound
Brothers good, no one broke around

Codeine crazy got me lazy
Bitches that wouldn't fade me want my baby
Couple years I'll be pushin' that Mercedes
Free lil bro, used fuck with 'em daily
Now I be blowing dope in the club
I used to shovel snow for the dub
Y'all still go to hoes for a hug
I just notice bros showing love, and that's...


I knew that life got its wonders I merely have to explore
You ever give someone your all and they still asking for more?
You ever witness all your dreams fucking crash through the door?
You ever have a open mind until it blast through the floor?
But I won't give my up hope, this shit is all that I got
Respect to ones who would love me whether I'm balling or not
'Cause when you fall from the top, dog, it's a hell of a crash
Ignore the haters and doubters with they irrelevant ass
Man, I just wanna make music, like fuck the cheddar and cash
'Cause it won't bring me to peace, and money never would last
I mean I'm better than that
I mean it shouldn't have changed
And I can't wait to break out and put my foot in the game
And tell them all about the song and won't mention your name, baby

I'm telling everyone I know this song is about you
And I'ma sing it all day, all night 'cause I want to
I want to tell the whole wide world 'bout your love

I'm sorry that I had to look, I heard you flew through the town
But I'll settle for less, damn I'm never the best
'Cause the only thing that really lasts forever is death
Go and shoot a couple videos, wear sweaters and vest
Just to show them that I'm different and I'm clever as chess
But honestly I'm the greatest and I'll dare to admit it
But others disagree if talent don't compare with the the digits
But money don't mean shit if you can't share with your niggas
We all eat if I eat, that's something rare with these niggas
I mean why squeeze on the paper, you can't take it with you
And buying shit a stress reliver, I'm facing issues
You know you doing something right when the hate official
But please, baby, pay attention 'cause I cause pray they miss you

I'm telling everyone I know this song is about you
And I'ma sing it all day, all night 'cause I want to
I want to tell the whole wide world 'bout your love
Your love, your love
It feels

You see it's always sunshine after the rain
And it's always some crying, laughter and pain
And I don't know how to prepare for the disaster and fame
Who I go to for guidance 'cause the pastor the same
I hate the struggle and mostly just how shitty it feels
Momma car got stolen twice around Hickory Hill
And we was catching the bus, but never missing a meal
But I appreciate the times, it made a nigga for real
Moved to the burbs, necessary bettered the living
Was a wonderful choice, I don't regret the decision
Plus I made some great friends that I'm never forgetting
I got a love for the music but the pleasure is missing
Don't appreciate the art, they never treasure the vision
But I still beat the odds, I'm not dead or in prison
So I'm grateful for the days, I'm not in debt to the system
Play the song and just pledge to the rhythm
'Cause baby we going far
I'm telling everyone I know this song is about you
And I'ma sing it all day, all night 'cause I want to
I want to tell the whole wide world 'bout your love
Your love, your love
It feels good
I want to tell the whole wide world 'bout your love
Your love, your love, your love, baby2Embed

Now a nigga only shop for finer
Catch me eating at hottest diners
Man that boy Entendre is finest rhymer (Ooh)

And I use it just about it in every lesson
I'm on the grind and I'm getting bigger

I saw myself in the mirror and I was just wasn't proud
You been ignoring the open window that come around
I mean let's say we begin and being lazy's a sin
You rather get crazy with friends til you staging your end
And with all the time lost you degrading your pen
And now you living check to check, gotta save for the rent
No one to blame but yourself, could have the fame and your wealth
But niggas rather spend it all on chains and a belt
I mean I never understood but each is it own
I'm reminded of my faults when I'm deep in the zone
And you always gotta peep who you keep in your home
It ain't no fooling me twice, no repeating my wrongs
Because I learn, I learn all from my mistakes
I try to get it, I get in in different kind of ways
We come from crooked fathers, ancestors, Brooklyn Dodgers
Generated to gangsters, ballers, to crooks and mobsters
My generations be Christians, they tell 'em look for Harvard
So I run the game for saint but Reggie Bush the starter
I'm 'bout to wild today and cheer like it's 2008
Back when "My president is black" was something proud to say
'cause shit I haven't seen change and Uzi drive a green Range
And life is draining everybody's hope, it's such a mean game
It' slapped me in the face, I got a taste at just as teenage
Think about my past, I chose my path, I go complete rage
I feel just like a author, got a story to tell
Where you choose two paths, either glory or hell
I mean we all got a road to follow, perform shows Apollo
And just blow colossal, believe me I know

Uh, rhyming just for the sake of rhyming
Making deals with bills, I gotta face the timing
But I'm ill with skills, a nigga patient minded
The beat killed and drilled, I gotta face the violence
It's flu season, these niggas hating for two reasons
Other rappers is salty, a nigga too seasoned
Other average and faulty, I'm a just a cool deacon
I'm too great with a new tape, like dude wait
I'm like Biggie, I'm hopping to never lose faith
And Mike Bibby the mind, I gotta shoot straight
And most likely supreme leader, a new age
Niggas shooting machine heaters and tools blaze
The game full of the fiends, divas and blue haze
Niggas listen to music like "Damn, this dude's great"
A small mixture of dark liquor and Lupe
A tall nigga, it's all scripture what you say
And all year I been killing the classics
Making the Good music and appealing to masses
Man they feeling this bastard, the realest of rappers
Surrounded by the goats, never chilling with average
'Cause I remember days when I didn't have the worries
I remember days me and Parris had 'em nervous
I remember days when we would kill it purpose
And now they gonna pay me service, it's worth it
I remember days when we was choppin' at the function
I remember days when we didn't have nothin'
All them late night on the grind count for somethin'
So fuck all the stupid assumption they wantin'

I see through all moves, John Wall and Brad Beal
I'm mad real, let's get it poppin' like Advil
But when you're seeing your people dying it's a sad feel
Enjoy life, you never know when's your last meal
It's so trife and crazy just how a blast kill
So please stop the judging me of my past still
'Cause soon all a nigga rocking is pastel
The best coming from DMV since Fat Trel
Niggas quitting and snitching, they grow a rat's tail
Like dude broke how the hell you make a fast bail
Putting out garbage albums for a fast sell
Don't needs that, the game faded like cheap tats
I preach facts, I piss music and bleed rap
So fuck no I don't need negative feedback
'Cause honestly I been dope since the eight grade
So make way 'cause a nigga on a mayday
I remember days when we was choppin' at the function
I remember days when we didn't have nothin'
All them late night on the grind count for somethin'
So fuck all the stupid assumption they wantin'
I remember days when I didn't have the worries

This for all my, uh, fellow people out there who, who just out there
(P. Soul on the track)
Yo-yo, yo-yo-yo-yo
Slow ride with it

I swear I hate you but I love you the same
You help ease all my troubles, help me go through the pain
And if it were not for you I'd be going insane
But for real you need to stay in your lane
I mean I love so much that I be eyeing you out
And when my lips touch yours I fly high in the clouds
And you always wake the neighbors, baby, you just too loud
But you always calm me down, that's why I keep around
But it's time for change where our paths will criss-cross
You made me fail that drug test, baby, I'm pissed off
Conservative big boss, you know my persona
Why you always on my sack, girl, that is a honor
I mean I'm gon' off the ganja, girl, your powers are magical
And the statement that I'm leavin' you is honestly laughable
The different view you show you me of the world is impractical
'Cause honestly exposure is a trait I'm attracted to
But change is needed and you know it's truth
Because that's the one thing that's more potent than you
Remember when we was alone and I would flow in the booth
The inspiration you gave, it made show and improve
And for that I'm so thankful, and you know that grateful
And if everyone tried you the world wouldn't be hateful
But you got your own faults, it ain't no lying at sin
You fuckin' up my community, kids try you at ten
Now let's try this again, second time we round the troops
Your impact is amazing, people die for a ounce of you
You even make 'em try a hashtag but I'm pounding you
But damn the way you the make us go crazy astounding boo
But always got benefits, you making my niggas rich
And quite a few go to jail for you so you splittin' it
Member days we'd be getting kicking it, we'd be watching the stars line
You even let start to sell you out through the hard times
Never let me go broke, I kept bread in my pocket
So I stop the using you and I used you profit
And for that I'm so sorry, was no reason for shopping you
I can't believe I pimped my main girl to a prostitute
But you make niggas rob and shoot and you ended a block or two
And you limit potential you make me wonder what I could do you make some grow addicted so it ain't no more stopping through
'Cause me in blowing in this rap shit is not optional
So girl we threw, I'm sorry I got to do this
And if I choose it you know my choice is the music
So I'm saying goodbye, you just apart of my old life
I knew for a couple years, knew rap for my whole life

My whole life for hours I been writing convictions
Temptation to striking a Christian, while he fighting position
Almighty forgiven, while looking for a righteous religion
Hopefully getting my people out of lightest positions

Rhyming since, like a god and shit in my consciousness
Some say he insane and I'm just out of it
'Cause wack rappers that's ass backwards is getting clout
Taking pictures with guns they don't know shit about
It's giving me not the bittest doubt I'm the realest out
They begging me to hear him out 'cause they fear me now
Why try to act hardcore or hard for

Tryna run up the numbers till I break the meter
Til' you face the heater, and you fake a seizure
Dog I gotta blow cuz my patience leaving
Two steps for the one time
Make them right hooks, and them punchlines
This is sorta like my NFL combine
When we wake up tomorrow pray for sunshine
It's a brighter day for tomorrow
In the trenches they living in sorrow
Fresh gear 'member days we would borrow
Damn this shit changing they shooting out Largo
'Member days was dreaming of Bentleys
Gucci, Prada shit I'll even wear Fendi
Fuck up a check when I cop my Balenci's
Broke and proud now I'm down to my pennies
Nigga been through a lot through the past year
On the road the riches on my last gear
Sick of dumb ass jobs was a cashier
Mixtapes get thrown in the trash here
Ironically they recycling bars

You gotta have drive I'm the type to floor it
So I'm speeding down life's highway
Tryna cop a benz in my driveway
I ain't been alseep in bout 5 days
And I'm gettin top from my side bae
Sometimes I hate the life that I'm living
Gramma whipping pies in that kitchen
Uncle be pushing weight, think I'm kidding
Rap niggas lie, I lie to my women. Aye!
Walk in Barney's just to fuck up a check
Dead broke now you stuck up in debt
Take a flick, double cuff just to flex
Upgrade my life from the shuttle to jets
Go from noodles to steak, I got food on my plate
Pave my own way you just do what they say
Y'all follow wave stay true my way
Ain't no waiting tomorrow I do it today

When you coming up you evolving
Member days we was balling
Starry night, the sky's falling
But everybody has a calling
I'm still searching for mine too
Plain sight from the sky view
Soul searching they'll find you
But got nowhere to hide too
And so I'm running away, I'm running away
Always running away, I'm running away
Gotta stop running away, I'm running away
Can't keep running away, running away2Embed

Some- this...
This is one of them joints, man

You ever have a bad dream?
Wake up and it's a sad thing
Paint a picture vivid, no flat screen
Gotta get the cash, C.R.E.A.M
Bright lights, see the flash beams
Life's a movie, better know that scene (haha)
Because I'm the leading actor of these fetus rappers
They all my sons, I gotta breed them faster
I'm undefeated for several reasons, I bring disaster
We need to see the pastor
With decency and laughter
They doubt I beat the chatter
But one day I'm gon' find myself
And I'ma do this shit by myself
But we gon' be straight, give me three days
I'll make a rhyme for pete's sake
Eat lobster and cheesecake
With vodka and cheap Bape
But we gon' get it, and get it again
Different Benz, same friends
I'm committed to win
It's no more lame trends
We is finished with them
And all the hater get a kick in the shin
But we don't fuck with that
Remember time was simple in tenth grade with bucket hats?
Pride gun, I tuck it back
Life crazy, my luck gets bad
Well I'ma say to you
We gon' make it through
And 'til the rain go away, I'm gon' play it cool
You might also like
Cause we all know how it goes
I know it's bad so let me tell you about it
All that glitters ain't gold
Life here's so sad, I seen hell around it

The hex or a spell around it
I'm humble, they tell I'm grounded
They shoot and there's shells around it
Trump and them bell has sounded
The end in times, will we burn for sins and crimes?
Spared for giving spares and shared beginning rhymes
But this is nowhere near the end, though
Miss Dave on the back porch smoking indo
Playing that Nintendo
Chilling with the kin folk
Everything A-OK like 10-4
But times done got harder
And we done got tougher
I didn't anticipate it
But shit's a lot rougher
But how can you thrive and succeed but not suffer?
The struggle make you real and the nigga got gutter
But soon straight steaks on my plate, hot butter
And everything gonna open up, stop clutter
So I'ma tell you, "Slow your roll, stand tall, don't fold
And everything that glitters ain't gold"
But you should
Cause we all know how it goes
I know it's bad so let me tell you about it
All that glitters ain't gold
Life here's so sad, I seen hell around it

I mean...
You just gotta bounce back from all your L's and come ten time harder. You can't do all the shit you can't change, right?2Embed
The reason why black people are so addicted to materialism is, we use materialism to vicariously add wealth to ourselves
In other words, I don't think much of me. I ain't nobody. But if I put these Air Jordans on, I will be
If I buy this house in a white suburb, I will be. You understand? If I get this white woman, I will be
If I get this Louis Vuitton bag, I will be. So, we use wealth to replace self-worth

'Kay, some may think I'm insane. Just a sprinkle of brain
I'm on the brink of a change. Clearly the underdog, but the dude is winning
I'm onto new beginnings. Race and just choose your engine
And living confused with sinning
I done got some problems. Trying to save this Gotham
Niggas robbing and killing, but it's up to me to stop them
But it drives me insane. Niggas grimy and slimy
So find me a change. I'd rather buy me a Range
But I've been removed from popping tags. I'd rather cop a Jag
Damn, can't stop the swag. Open gates, lock 'em back
Got us all in prison. Income from writtens
Flow is so persistent, but the fame got me tripping
I done moved past the shoes, bags, the waves and do' rags
Your wave is due past. It's over, was too dragged
Never on a newcast in cars that move fast
Save up, don't lose cash to working for two sacks

'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting

And my Bugatti, I park it. Issey Miyake my closet
And this money that I'm making, I'm gon' show it off
Odd are, couple years, I'm gon' blow it all
Can't resist the urge to spend. My problems are worsening
I'm going to church to sin. Please close the curtaining
Your whole life's been open, explain the pipe you're smoking
Plus, like the pills you're popping, the way to deal has got 'em
Straight up going insane. It ain't flowing the same
It seems like y'all start to change with the hoes and the fame
'Cause a nigga got some dollars, gotta change up my homies
Straight become a new person, while forgetting the old me

Fuck being a role model, all I want is the sponsors
Sad that I sold my soul for money, the hoes and gold
I'm stressed and blowing dope because the Holy Ghost
Made the wrong decision, like the longest living
But got the strongest vision, clouded by thongs on women
But I know all these vices. Gotta stay enlightened
With the fame, I won't change. I'mma beat it, I'mma fight it
Blowing up the first year, talking 'bout the birth year
Becoming what I hate, a false prophet, that's my worst fear

Nigga, you just wait 'til I come up, nigga
Y'all- Y'all think I'm playing, like it's a joke or something?
When you see me come around in that Bentley truck and I'm fucking shit up
You're gonna want to ride with me
When you see me step out the car, huh, but let's see how I could run this
Huh, $500 on my ass
Huh, 700 on my feet
Uh, these niggas is cheap
I'm talking V.V.S. down to the motherfucking toe
I'm talking 'bout motherfucking 6 karat for the pinky ring, nigga1Embed
For instance, the average so-called Negro, he doesn't think that he can go into business and provide jobs for himself
And because of this, he thinks that he can only get a job from the White man
Or he can only get clothes from the White man, or he can only get food from the White man

Uh, we're takin' over the the racist motive, the hatred's older
The empire's retired, I'm just an ageist Yoda
Get some powder and baking soda, don't take the culture
They flip faster than racing motors. I'm made to blow up
If you don't understand now, then you will later
I'm from a place where they bust Glocks and steal paper
Nah, I'm talking assassination, they kill mayors
But can't overtake me because my skill's greater
Rap politician. Nominate my Congress
Never understood the Obama-hating nonsense
Black president. Dog, you hever had an option
'Cause, boy, I go monster way better than the Loch Ness
Let's get back to the subject: Blacks in the public
It seems like all other rap doesn't touch it
See, I tend to be the industry's redheaded stepchild
I've spoken too much. I'm surprised I'm not dead now

'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around

It's time to overthrow this government. Military coup
'Cause if we don't soon, they'll still bury you
And the first plan of action: Man, y'all gotta stop the shooting
And no dickriding, that's technically prostitution
No backwards progression, always constant movement
Everything is in your hands, you just gotta grind to do it
But first things first needs diplomatic correction
'Cause rappers like me in the systematic oppression
Huey Newton of this rap shit. Y'all don't understand me
The same reason why Nas and Snoop still don't have a Grammy
Why you gotta blow thousands when you fly to Miami?
And why you can't be a rapper if you drive in a Camry?
They make it uncool to budget, want us blowing our cash
Then Uncle Sam makes us broke again when taking our tax
So depressed from this hex they supply in prescriptions
Modern day drug war, these rappers fighting addiction

'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased

Coming out of McDonalds, I ordered a Quarter Pounder
Outside, they surround us, and dope, they finally found us
Out of his waste deep cooler, and justifying the toolies
Not understanding and demanding the reason for bullshit
These niggas I was cool with, and naturally went to school with
My methods, very foolish, my mouth's foaming, I'm drooling
Anticipation, waiting, your life could end any day, man
Who and when we jam us, we another plot by Raymond
To understand the present, you must first learn the past
It musta been last Thursday, was his girl's birthday
See I was there, cuz me and Raymond was close friends
And there I say, is when the story begins
See, this girl was always flirting, I was sure that she want me
And honestly, I wanted her back
And while he was there, there was nothing to that
Plus I was never a snake, but soon got carried away
We met the very next day
And honestly it was worth it cuz his girl was so perfect
And anything he decided to do, man I deserved it
Fast forward, he screamed, "Do you want to be a clown now"
He musta found out what I'm doing, so I bowed down

You punk ass know who you are
Lost
Step inside

It was a plan
After me, Jimmy was his closest man
We should ride this nigga after school
Take his wallet and his shoes
Find a ride to McDonalds, you know he like Quarter Pounders
Throw his ass in the trashes, and keep him quiet and surround him
"Hey Jimmy, I don't think you heard the story before
I was cooling last Thursday, found out she a hoe"
And said, "You're a liar. I was trying hard to fuck if I can
Why you going smacking my girl and saying you my mans"
But fuck it
Back to the story, he know that he ain't got the glory
After robbing this nigga, I just might get back with Tory
And the adrenaline rush, send me shaking my hand
And I fired a couple shots, no mercy up in my mans
For real, I don't think he gon' live to see a deal
We drinking while popping pills
I'm stretching to make this kill
Uh, he start to panic, prolly thinking bout his will
I take the mask off, and told him that you know I'm Raymond still
Woah1Embed
Yeah, uh

I seen her walk into class, should I talk, should I pass
No, I gotta get her now, ain't no stalking her ass
The only way to go, and shit, the worst she could say is no
You looking like a movie actress, gotta play the role
Jennifer Aniston, I’m trembling, panicking
Nah nigga, I'll manage it, if you don't bag her, you’re damaging
Your own self-conscious, long hair Pocahontas
Go to her, be honest, your scared, shit, it's nonsense
And so I say, "Do I know you from somewhere
I love how your skin start to glow in the sun flares
Staring through my soul, goddamn it's unfair
Let's head to my crib, we can have fun there"
She say, "No nigga, what, you think I don't know nigga
Been around the block a couple times, youse a hoe nigga"
But fuck that I'm tryna grow witcha
And if I leave without your number, I'll be so bitter
But fuck the rumors and shit, always ruining shit
And be getting in the way, when I'm pursuing a chick
And I put it on my mama, I don’t be doing this shit
That’s ludicrous, I'm new to this, I don’t want to shoot it and miss

We just in sync or maybe it's human instincts
Your faking on a real nigga, shoulda been linked
And then she tell me 'bout her past and shit
And how her last would get mad, whip her ass and shit
I'm like damn, how the hell you go to class and sit
And pretend like it's ok, you ain't no average chick

Can't compare the situation cuz it isn't the same

I'm Leonardo da Vinci, buy you Gucci and Fendi
The Prada, you saying nada, the other girls gonna envy
So don't worry bout that he say/she say shit
Cuz she's mad that he raps, he basic

Broken homes, picture frames hangin'
And jewelry always being snatched, ain't no chains swingin'
I witnessed a wicked decision and did plenty of living
Picture a nigga whose vision is just no longer vivid
Pour out the liquor on scripture so they say it was written
But the message of the story is just your position, I mean
You ever see dreams crumbling in your eyes
The thundering in the skies have you wondering if it's God
But I'm one of them, I survived by 
We stay true for generations, that's designer jeans
And your whole life you just desire for the finer things
Like that imaginary husband with the diamond ring
But ain't no other way to get it so we try to scheme
But never sleep 'cause I hear tears from your dying dreams

All the hurt got me laughing at pain
'Cause the sun comes after the rain
Oh, but life ain't fair
Hurricanes got me passing with rage

And you find yourself with nothing once the damage is finished

'Cause when your heart filled with hate, I know it taint your soul
And dare I say to prosper, dog, you gotta play your roll
With music I'm a young Picasso and I paint in gold
I know the feel to have your checks always jump and they bounce
Acquire about accounts, you know what's the amount
And you wanna cop that bike for your daughter to ride
But you go up front to pay and your card'll decline
And this just another day, yeah your life full of struggle
But it won't last long,  on the double because...

Been through it all, seen it all in no order
My rhymes Arizona, state lines ain’t got no border

Pound for pound, check the sound, words my crown on the throne

Just another rapper died
That’s why I move the way that I move, gotta strategize
I see your dreams crumble in person, you had the saddest eyes
Mom, would you be mad if I

So DMV nigga, I read scriptures
Drowning in all this cheap liquor
And one bad day will turn your whole week bitter
This past year, I took more L's than Meek nigga
But I'm hopping out the van in Africa, with chains and safaris
My man told me, "Make a hit that they can play in the parties"
But I'll stay true to my roots like Damian Marley
I took a couple money picks, tell Jay Z I'm sorry
Laying out my blueprints, hoping to make the new rent
Last month we made it but barely, I’m just a student
Shit, that’s just excuses
But I don't do the talking, I leave it all in the music
Damn, what’s my influence
That's the question to ask
If this breath be my last
Will I still be remembered, what I left in the past
And will my impact show niggas that I was destined to rap
The only option besides balling and catching a pass

Got some new listeners, like this nigga nice
Ain't no secret to these hoes, how they operate
Man these bitches ain't shit, word to Dr. Dre
Hate to call my sisters bitches, but what not to say
I witness shit first hand, and I'm shocked today

I know you been through a lot today
I'll try my best to stay out your way
But who else gonna treat you real like I do
Five dollar box, drop top, drive thru
Always stood tall and you only 5'2"
Nothing else new, what did I do to surprise you
But it shouldn't though

Gotta keep it real with you
Don't know how to deal with you
Maybe overthinking, possibly it's just the still liquor
Even met your mommy, brother Tommy told me not to Hilfiger
Keep it all concealed, what's the deal, I'm a trill nigga
How I maneuver, hit it right to ya
Last nigga, Nick, ain't shit, he manure
Used to be the same, thank God that I grew up
Feel it in your guts, make you want to throw your food up
Imagine working hours and hours and nobody noticed yet
You shit on your peers, this shit is so clear
But still don't get no respect
I live out my dreams, this shit is serene
So I don't got no regrets
Woke up, feeling down and deadbeat
Then she lift me up, when she telling me
I know you been through a lot today
I'll try my best to stay out your way
But who else gonna treat you real like I do
Five dollar box, drop top, drive thru
Always stood tall and you only 5'2"
Nothing else new, what did I do to surprise you
But it shouldn't though1Embed
Let me tell you about a young nigga, been through it all
And let me tell you about a dumb nigga, witness his fall
Both had similar beginings, both was getting involved
But both couldn't be different how they finished it off
See to start with the first nigga, name was Raymond
Drug dealer, dope boy damn his chain was hanging
Drove a Lex, bitches Hex (?) Did his thang from slanging
Plus a nigga kept his steel and his range was stainless
Move rocks from 9-1 til 2002
Vegas Nights going crazy even found him a boo
Hit the club 50 deep, was surrounded with troops
Never lacked ( ... ) (....) to you, Everything was well plotted
Planned it all in advance, got fronted his first brick
Started off with a chance, put his homeboy on, watch who you calling ya mans. Cause niggas snakes tell the jakes(?) til it fall out of his hands
Watch the jealous niggas too
Yeah the ones with greed
The ones who watched you starve
The ones you feed
The ones you always give but always need
You gotta.. cut them off and watch them bleed
And these are all wise words, these are laws of power
Never listen to the words from the jaws of cowards
Cuz these niggas tell lies that are as tall as towers
Where the weak dont eat and the small devoured
You might also likeYou see Raymond learned these things in the earliest stage
From ATL to New York, Niggas heard of his rage
He growing mad with dollars, gucci collar, fendi , prada
Nigga fall in love with designer
Blowing cash real fast, never building a savings
Start to hit a couple licks, even steal from the Haitians
Coming back on top, making bills and them payments
But its only temporary, brother killed on the pavement
Now his eyes is open, growing wiser, start to stack his bread, a soul survivor
But his karma coming bold and proper
Heres the key to the safe what he told Elijah
Remember what i said before, watch who you calling your brother
The same niggas that you trusted make you fall in the gutter
Elijah had his own plan, he wasn't a grown man, traded stocks with the enemy, robbed his own (...)?
Called Raymond, crying and pleading, couldn't believe him
Stole from his own homie, damn.. Really deceived him
But nah Raymond not mad, that nigga calm and collective
Kicked Elijah out the gang, took his charm and his necklace
See he thought Raymond was lacking, but was given a test
But he failed.. two shots and got hit in his vest
We dont tolerate the rats, we get'n rid of the pest
Had to sacrifice, the brooks life, legitimate chest
Thats how you gotta approach it, we never hide and we focus
But we posted on the block like Thompson & Bogut
See he tryna get out the game and have a early retirement
Wasted talent but he's just a product of his environment
Not to mention the tension, visits (?) is getting so tiring
Knowing he could be next, his brother's death is inspiring (?)
Time expiring, quickly gotta think of a plan
Cause feds tapping , kidnapping getting linked to his camp
Niggas banging on the door, notice the blink and the lamps
They was plotting and scheming, yeah the robbers and demons
And everyday is someone thats on his property gleamin
But you know his AK is always properly beamin
Tired of living this shit and straight sick of this life
Plus he a grown man now, he got a kid and a wife
And had a lil rough start but now he getting it right
Signs from god overbearing, peep the flickering lights
So he saved a lump some, still collecting his royalty
Know the game is so fake and niggas they lack loyalty
In chains called the cop? more important his lawyer fees
The livestyle he living it is getting so spoiling
So he had to man up, start making his boss move
Invest in yourself cause dawg thats all you
He used to play with steel and using the raw tools
But he left the crack game and went in to law schoolEmbed
Ha

What they tell you, don't believe it, damn I'm just a college kid
Switch up the style, us niggas and bitches be wilding
Shop and spend about a thousand
If it's the money on it, I'm about it
Pray for it on the game, niggas not childish
Smoking on good gas, it's astounding
Never trust a nigga, whose surrounding
I done seen it all through the late nights
Where your mans make you think you hate life
Just another way to get your face wiped

Haters hating for the low (Damn)
I'm in the mood like an entrepreneur
Rappers be bluffing, they spitting manure
Play with 3oh and you in a funeral (3oh)
Pockets got benjamins, then benjamins got bluer
I'm in Miami, in a gang with the scooter
Shorty so fat, I need to get her a tutor
I'm in California, cooling with Hoovers
Niggas keep Tweeting, they talk to computers
Pull up on an opp, I'm taking his shoes
Come to my city, I'm taking your jewels

Look! I started off, niggas hard and soft
But acting hard and raw
Sneak dissing, you retarded
Raw, they wasn't smart at all

Shoot 'em up, Then I watch 'em fall
Fuck that bitch and kick her like a soccer ball
Pull up on her pussy just to pop it off

Double life and a nigga been stressin'
Played your song, damn that shit was depressin'
Niggas flexin' in studio sessions
Bad bitch and I swear she a blessin'
Boy I'm the man, you rap and don't got a plan
Free my little bro off the gang

You play with me, I'm let that shit blam
And where you stand is where you gon' land, Wow

Niggas talk crazy, won't do shit (Talking stupid)

And we uhaul when we move shit

Running looselip, bro got blue tips
But be ducking niggas on some guc shit
Pulling fucking triggers on a nuisance
But I'm not a gangsta I be coopin'

Fuck her on monday and call her a cutie
I'm fucking another bitch by Tuesday
No fucking, no nigga I'm toting a tooly
These bitches don't mean nothing to me

Hollow thrills, I don't swallow pills, I'm bout my dolla' bills
A real nigga, cause my father real but people plot and kill
Real nigga, you should fucking know
And its double S fucking O, we'll fuck your ho
And we'll slap your bro, wow

When they see you down, they don't see the vision
Grinding hard was a sweet decision
Pocket stuffed they on Peter Griffen
Now I'm making money I complete the mission
Bitches used to block me, now they wanna jock me
And she give me sloppy like her teeth is missing
Bro they keep a shotty like a fucking hobby
Chop a haters body now he breathing different
Quarter back shit in the field due
They keep your ass down to conceal you
The killing our kids on the steel moon
They'll be busting at niggas, what will do

If bro see you up, I'm like kill who
If he point at you imma kill you
I'm out on the field and niggas be fake
And I'm paraplegic, don't feel you

Nigga straight, she don't mind my posture
Eating steak, benihanas and lobster
Wish a nigga with em like Mr. Crocker
Put a fo' with a sprite of a boxer
Sippin' on lean so it fuck up my posture
While young niggas on my roster
If I ain't a chopper you gon' need a doctor
Or a breathalyser, he ain't breathing properly
I fucked her throat, so she ain't speaking properly
If the fans come, we ain't speaking louder, Shhh, Don't say a sound
In my trap you gon' work bitch and don't lay around
I don't like sneak dissing and don't play around
If you got a problem won't don't you go say it now
If your plug work with us we gon' show em some love
But if he taxin' we gon' take em down

Gang (Gang, Gang, gang, gang,)

So tired, my eyes
Slow ride
Ok

I can feel you're nervous
But can't consider purpose
I practice verses 'till they're perfect
They say I'm wasted time, it's worthless
Sometimes, I even think the same
Smoke good, it'll always ease the pain
Sunshine gon' always beat the rain
Carpe diem, nigga, always seize the day
I got a couple prayers for the churches
Always double layers in my verses
Damn, they putting mayors in the hurses
Where there's more to life, there's a purpose
See, I try to teach to you
Tell you little niggas what you need to do
No ceilings, you can't see the roof
Know we all tryna cop a Bean or Coupe
Have I failed as a mentor?
Little niggas in the prison, never listen cuz they been poor
Reach to them but they still gonna send more
But they'll be ok like ten, four
Just keep your head up, if you fed up
Find a different way to get the cheddar
Just copped the Benz, fuck a Jetta
Now all my friends doing better
But we still gotta grind though
Waking up early morning, no alarms though
Got your bitch so wet, need a poncho
Only love me cuz a nigga on a honcho
But I fucking got to get it
But the feds got a problem with it
Switch flows, that was my decision
End the hating, we stop division
But ain't no way they gon' stop divisions

We must keep it going (keep it going)
Like the breeze that's in the ocean (ocean)
Baby find a piece, to keep the motion (motion)
Cuz we rolling and we rolling
And I'll admit my wrongs
Wondering if I was right alone
Know the thoughts and feels when you alone (alone)
But we on and we on

And so I left the wave, riding like Poseidon
Cameras flashing with the light, it's so exciting
Down and out but feeling vibrant, never violent
If a nigga ever trying, he be dying
Cuz I got a couple cousins who be busting
We tryna chase a sack but I ain't rushing
They quick to bring the gats, they never bluffing
Taking your shoes and cash, and that ain't nothing
All, back to the middle with a hat
And a little bit of wax, with the fit up in a match
Attack when it brittle, with the gat so belittle, with a patch
But you never find the facts
Another crime that's going unsolved
Police sirens after gun drawls
Blow is cold, it's never unthawed
Make them hits, you rappers punch soft
Took a "L" but life's a front, loss
Lesson learned so I'm less concerned
And the boy flow dirty like infected germs
So sick, let me fuck, you might catch the burr
No remedies, just enemies
And I get angry off that Henessey
Now my heart colder than ten degrees
But this shit ain't new, dawg, I been to b's
But
We must keep it going (keep it going)
Like the breeze that's in the ocean (ocean)
Baby find a piece, to keep the motion (motion)
Cuz we rolling and we rolling
And I'll admit my wrongs
Wondering if I was right alone

What if I blow up tomorrow, what am I to become?
I won't be another rapper who was found with a gun
That's not the life that I'm living, I'm fulfilled with a purpose
I'ma be the greatest ever, man, I feel I deserve it
Them kids get younger and dumber
Them boys will steal from the churches
They always say that they hurting
Gotta heal from my verses
I'm a leader of men and I'm the voice of the youth
But old niggas gon' listen, say this boy is the truth
I got the veteran bars like I'm the boy with the troops
And yeah I'm from the Southside but this ain't Lloyd in the booth
I got a verse and a chorus
And my songs gonna flourish
Only worry bout growth, man, that's word to the florist
Niggas always switching sides, call the guys out for remorse
But I'm always running shit, they tryna block where I'm going
But they can't stop it, I'm Jordan
My new watch is imported
Now my timing is perfect, I will not be distorted

Because we live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus, I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings
We live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus cuz I can't tell you what they gon' bring

Got my mind on the blunt, bunch of silly distractions
I gotta pocket full of dreams, I wish they really would happen
But in the city, they clapping
Bunch of overreactions
It's like I'm finished with a poem cuz they niggas be snapping
Let's do it big with the rapping
Talking real and they hear you
But we going different ways, I see your breaks in my rearview
Fuck it, let's get it and go
I remember rapping off of middle end roll
Switching the flows, feel like we never did it before
When niggas got cold, squads broke, they picked and they rolled
We gave all we got, I'll give till I'm ghost
Once I'm Casper, rapper
These niggas pussy like Jaz the rapper
I'm trying to afford me a forty Meek and back to back it
But nevertheless, they showing off but never respect
Just try to put me on but never the rest
Living the best

Because we live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus, I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings

My mind is on Venus cuz I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings (sing)
Listen
All my life, I just be searching, asking what is my purpose
These niggas watching me and I feel like I'm trapped in a circus
Just cuz I can rap about bad bitches, chilling, sipping some lean
And I can rap about me selling drugs and all of the things
Tell my soul man, I can't let them niggas hear what I say
I'm trying to change the world and maybe I can do that today
I never change what I believe, man, I stay true to myself
You can't pay me to speak, deaf just to offer me wealth
And I'm tired of people thinking that I got nothing to prove
They think I'm on the road to nothing cuz I dropped out of school
These niggas don't know the work I put in to be here
And I never take any orders cuz the boat's what I steer
And never ask what if, or how would things be different if I
I just faced my fears, got off my ass and said fuck it, and just tried
And one thing, when I'm at the top, I can look back and be proud
I see applause and nominations when I look at the crowd
Yeah

Because we live in a high road
And we can't leave it, no matter where I go
My mind is on Venus, I can't tell you what they gon' bring
And I can't tell you why the caged bird sings
We live in a high road

Just let it talk to the heart
Just let me talk to it
Yeah

Blessed with a mind, to help me shine to the throne
Didn't have any supporter, had to grind on my own
And where I’m from, you get sprayed, like the finest cologne
So if they shoot, you better duck, else you'll be dying alone
Consider yourself lucky when you listen to this
I told y'all I was the greatest, I predicted this shit
It’s funny cuz the same girls, sucking and licking the dick
Will go home and just start kissing their kids
And they always back for more, like why they bother us
I told you I'll call back, just soon as my father does
And when they doubt themselves, it start to build up a lot of lust
I do it all to make them proud, but that's still not enough
But fuck it, that's just the art of anticipation
She fucked the judge and the litigation
And why them niggas hating
Cuz I be flowing like irrigation and perennation
Had to rush and drop the tape, because the man was patient
No pun intended, I'm at the doctors, I'm ill as fuck
I'm healing up, they not feeling you, you not real enough
And to be honest dawg, you really suck
Find another hobby ASAP, please give it up
But fuck it
I'm recording a tape up in my mama’s basement
And when it would start to get late man, she would fucking hate it
I told her "I’ll take care of payments when I fucking make it"
So I'm at home grinding, while y’all get fucking wasted
But mom told me this rap shit is a waste of time
Like nigga why you doing this, you haven't made a dime
Won't even listen to my song, like what's your favorite line
But to cop my next album, y’all gon' wait in lines
For real and parents said that we gon' make it soon
We better nigga, I'm hungry like where's my plate of food
Remember when you dropped Training Day and they hated you
If I made it, you made it too, we gonna make it fool
I swear, I fucking love it when they envy me
So shout out to my haters, you the real MVP
And easily, the nicest coming out the DMV

It was five of us in a Volvo
Not thinking about tomorrow
Cuz we was living in sorrow
But hopefully, I could borrow
Some food for though cuz niggas is money hungry
Take us through the parties, where there's plenty hunnies
And liquor, hooked up to this nigga
He pull out the trigger, and hit my man
Adrenaline rush and so shit I ran and did everything that I can
Till my sore knee just popped out of place
Then they stopped my way, and noticed I was rocking J's
So we pull out the Glock and spray
Not knowing what else to do, I play dead, lay down
The irony of it all, I started to pray now
God said, "What do you want from me
Cuz you only call when your really want something
Not when you in front, running"
I said, "Treat you right, man, my sinning is true
Always put myself in danger and depending on you"
So we hopped in the car and dashed
Hit the pedal, going fast
And a quarter mile later, car ran out of gas
Like, damn that shit's amazing
Damn that shit's amazing
Cuz I always end up in a crazy situation
I swear, I can't even tell my friends from my enemies
Know too many people, swear that's gonna be the end of me
Cuz

Very nervous, so I'm covered in sweat
Cuz niggas is coming with bloodlust and a tech
And left for no other option
So if they come, enough problems
So imagine, going through without Batman and you got him
They pull up in a stratus
Bringing out automatics
And then start loading and blasting
But that's not even as tragic
It's magical, I survived
Battle death on my mind
Can't go yet, I gotta jet, this might just threaten my grind
So my keys jangling, thoughts sinking, it might not make it
Get a chance we gon' take it
Till they, "Damn this nigga made it"
The jewels, watch, phone, and finally my Jordans
I'm thinking over what's more important
Mind is distorted
My heart is filled with malice and hate, no way to avoid it
You either lose your pride or die, you know the choices
Hopped in the minivan, I ain't backing out from that man
Took off his mask, gassed at last
Shit that was my man, but damn
Lord forgive me, I commited a sin
Cuz problem is, I'm probably gonna do it again
Cuz I'm just so stupid
And I'm just so clueless
And I always go through it
I swear, I'll do it again

This, this for the real

Now let me try to reconsider, before I start to address
Would I be searching for the answers, that's a part of this test
But that's life, it's a given, now I'm harder to stress
And in my mind, I'm in prison, in my heart, I'm just blessed
Don't respond to whack rappers, I just target the best
I switched out and stayed true, you just marketing less
Can't you fathom when you down and you dark and depressed
This for them folks who like drowning with the sharks and the pets
I'm just a regular nigga
Searching different ways to better my figures
Forever, they bitter
I know it, and I never will give up
Clever endeavors, I treasure, on my dresser is scriptures
What this mean, it's protection, know Baretta is thinking
Cuz I need it, the streets leave you speechless
Our demons, and niggas schemin', no room for a thesis
Life's a struggle that have you puzzled, I'm searching for pieces
I'm planning for better days, where house on the beaches

Let me tell you about the good
Let me tell you bout the bad
Let me tell you how it should
But it never gonna last

This whole year I learned one thing, that life's a killer
To survive through the jungles, had to fight gorillas
And I don't really do collabs cuz I'm twice as iller
So no exchange go around, no Bryson Tiller
Next out the DMV and not the license dealer
And now the pressure's on me, sounds quite familiar
But I'm up for the task cuz my mic is realer
Ironically, your girl left cuz she like a thriller
And I see they so scared cuz I'm getting better
I be speaking to them folks with my written letters
Man I want it bad now, want this shit forever
And every line like damn, man this nigga clever
I'm bragging different, but minimizing is half official
Cuz I believe in unity and that's what rap is missing
My swag terrific, so effortless, pull the baddest bitches
Time to paint a new story cuz my last was vivid1Embed
I swear that I fall in love way too easily
When I don't need to be
Cuz none of them really believe in me
They all deceiving me
Just telling me what I want to hear
If they not real, then I don’t want them here
Cuz nowadays, it's hard to find a real girl cuz they just not as real
Call me a failure, I don't gotta deal
The stress make you swallow a lot of pills
And jump off the tallest hills
All this cuz you didn’t call him still

Now tell me, do you love me
We had a couple problems, do you trust me
You can't get rid of me that easy, girl your mama love me
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going
So tell me where are we at
You got a couple girls, now where they be at
And even though I broke your heart, I'm hoping that you'll be back
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going down

A lot of ladies want me to fall in love, but I’m not falling
Ignored Leia till she stopped calling
Maybe that's too much
I ain’t one for love, I play with it too much
Leia can't take me serious, cuz I'm faking it too much
Now what's the first name of this fucking girl that I’m feeling on
I'm cheating on girls that I got feelings for
Ain't hard to tempt me
Girl, we can build like them architects be
You call me your dawg and friendly
But inside my heart you defend me

Now tell me, do you love me
We had a couple problems, do you trust me
You can't get rid of me that easy, girl your mama love me
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going
So tell me where are we at
You got a couple girls, now where they be at
And even though I broke your heart, I'm hoping that you'll be back
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going down
Fade to another dimension, as we getting eternal
Love burn like inferno, fall too easy I've learned though
To never trust, but never live in forever lust
L's, we want a better us, as we develop rust
But women, as a whole, overall are just fake as shit
And the ones who be snaking shit, want relationship
But on the other hand, fuck bitches, get rubber bands
And understand, never trust anyone other than
Those that was with you before you got official
And the day ones, that never forget where you fucking came from
Cuz when I found myself needing something, no one's around to help
So I switch it up, lift it up
And found it in myself

Now tell me, do you love me
We had a couple problems, do you trust me
You can't get rid of me that easy, girl your mama love me
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going

You got a couple girls, now where they be at
And even though I broke your heart, I'm hoping that you'll be back

You can't get rid of me that easy, girl your mama love me

Yeah
Yo man, I'm tired of everybody for real
Nobody believe in me
Everybody doubting me
Nobody even think I'ma make it
This is crazy, yo
But that shit's all the motivation for me to kill these niggas
Uh

Niggas is blatantly, hating me, out of disrespect
I grab the Smith and Wess, grab the tech, aim at your intellect
Your work acting, send me shit with flex
Never stressing off rejection because it's incorrect
So you can say I suck, your pen is lame as fuck
Couldn't be gay enough, boy, it's time to straighten up
Because it's hunting season and you got to get your own
You follow labels and fables, well you just did it wrong
Hopefully man, you just listen when you hear this song
And that you get it this time, I made it clear and long
Cuz your dissatisfied, stupid and clueless, your foolish music
Cuz who the truest, you niggas don't know what two and two is
For my niggas that sin and struggle and working double
For the bitches who say they love you and fuck your brother
I cannot take it cuz all the fakers, they hating blatant
Your mans has a smile on his face, but don't want you to make it
This shit is real, I told him that I'ma get the deal
So grip the pill cuz I'm telling you that this kid is ill
My first paid position, an important part of rap
I spit the sickest in lyrics, I give your heart a tax
I love the gold, the jewelry, my chains is artifacts
But the rappers hopping out, they just far from facts
But me and M1, we gon' triple our income
I make a million in dollars, shit give me ten months
I'm far from stupid, in fact, smarter than Harvard students
I spark a movement and put it into this garbage music
You niggas crazy, your bitches played me in his Mercedes
My man lately against the odds like I'm Brenda's baby
Underrated, I've had enough cuz they after what
All the haters can grab my nuts, while I laugh it up
I'm tired of everyone, really, I might just end it all
I'm finna show off getting on the Forbes list, win or lossYou might also like1Embed

Hop up on the track with the super funky flow
With these instrumentals, I be putting on a show
Cuz I'm itching for some dough
I could really use some mo
Because I'm poor as hell, my people living in poverty
Tryna get a record deal, but they never acknowledge me
They continue to sign these rappers that sound legitimate
I remade the sound, but still be spitting the illest shit
But I'ma do it big to pay the bills for my mother
I kick it with the Tundra cuz he's known to bring the hunda
I wonder
Why they always knock the brother down
That was underground
But wants to wear the mainstream crown
Wow, please someone give me an explanation
Of the constant hating
On the new Baltimore rap sensation
He goes by Raff Alpha
He's supa, dupa clever
Yelling out, "Rest in Peace to Nelson Mandela"

Ain't no use to you, running now
We already sonned you clowns
But I'ma make it, I'm confident

But in the future they gon' all know who Entendre is
Wondering about the far skies, whether apartheid
Tired of the dark lies, they say in our eyes
Fuck a history, life is misery with its enemies
Get you mentally, was meant to be this way essentially
For centuries, my niggas been stuffed in penitentiaries
To infinity, they want us all gone eventually
Fuck America, cause hysteria and the chaos
Cuz in my area, life's a gamble like Las Vegas
And they watch me rap off Omega

Freezing up the paper that we coil
Nigga Giovanni lacks the huge, rooted from the soil
We use it for oil, fueling my aura
When it get sports, with that raw shit that's never gonna spoil
Check the aura, ah
I used to flow from the mainstream
From the rivers to the lakes, creeks
Until I figured out that the swimmer would never shake me
Flapping my fin
You see they attack swimmers safely
Got that ocean flow, that swallowed though, that spaced me
Styling free, with the spirit of the bigs
Lord is killing them softly till they graves, don't you dig
He's taking a swig of the roots that he's made me
I'm the Raff Alpha of these double entendres baby

When I first met her in seventh period
Body was something serious
Told her that I was curious
Could I get your number, digits and address
And maybe later I could get inside your mattress
Forgive me but that's just suck on my mental
Plus you is who I'm really into
Touching bodies so gentile
But you don't know what I've been through
More than just meets the eye
But I'm trying to look deep inside
Plus I wanted to be that guy
So I'll never just cheat or lie
Cuz you special to me
She remind me of rose petals, and the meadow in spring
But she attracted to the devil in me
She said, "Her life was bad for me"
Thinking irrationally
On her back, she ride so attractively
I love growing so rapidly
Then we start sharing our thoughts and getting personal
She starts to talk about the other guys that hurt her soul
She said that your no different
You learn it then you live it
She start touching my pendant
Then we start touching and kissing

Cuz you that soul that's on mind, I'm going crazy
Why I am I such a sucker for love
Damn, I'm such a sucker for love

And I can see all the hurt and pain that is in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy, tryna get in her thighs
Sometimes she say she mess with other girls to improvise
Saying that niggas ain't shit and just start to minimize
Couple months later, finally go to her house
She starts the kissing on my neck, and so I open her blouse
I ask her, "Can I penetrate?"
She said she never been afraid
Going through this renegade
As our thoughts just interchange

Why don't you love me?
Why do you hate me?

Yo, I'm tired of this shit
Alright, yo, I got this shit yo
Damn

Now whatchu supposed to do
When you can't trust the ones whose most close to you
Tryna look at life with a third eye, such an open view
Till you realize that this shit suck
Makes you want to give up
But I got too much to lose, man this get tough
As you can see, I got the eye of the tiger
And fight fire with fire
But I know the messiah shall save y'all from bias and liars
Even though sometimes life's gon' be a real tussle
The tough times, it's hard to find someone that still love you
And if you do, it seems though, you have a precious piece
I always go like Mike Jackson, straight molesting beats
I'm so disrespectful, so let the legend rest in peace
My mama told me that my mouth gon' be the death of me
She prolly right though
The way I be flowing, like Mitchell, psycho
Gonna get me a deal, like Pac is gonna need lipo
Sometimes I just get anger and wanna just grab the rifle
Cuz me and Leone listen to rappers that act like light shows
And Shy Glizzy run circles more, but they won't ride with me
I get the papers and pull, this supposed to be my city
It seems like nobody respect my craft
Or the check I grab
To release the stress I have
That's why I'm screaming, "Fuck America"
Feeling like Adolf
Mama work for the government and still got laid off
Never went through a struggle, always lived in the suburbs
Straight A's, the dumb nerd
Never drunk, never puffed herb
I guess cuz it's not trap, my music overlooked
So on this tape, I swear my life just like an open book
I spit, and I paint pictures
Your music, just ain't vivid
Rapping bout that life that we all know that you ain't living
Shit, I guess it's just about sales nowadays
Talking about this trapper, how he went to jail, now he paid
See, what happened to real music
Some people they still do it
But overall, for overall this is real stupid
But this is genesis, work of art for him is penmanship
I just started, I'm bout to kill it, let me finish itYou might also like1Embed
I'm just another world’s rapper who was hated by his own mother
Never win a Grammy, never make the Rolling Stone's cover
I was having trouble to sell
Never be on double XL
My whole life a struggle and hell
Sometimes, they want to take the easy way out
They think of suicide
But I got to much to lose, right now it's do or die
Yo, these rappers be tripping, yeah my shoes are tied
No offense, but on the mic, I’m a ruthless guy
But right now, I want that top spot
Skipping school, hopscotch
Praying for that drop top
Until then, I will not stop
Till I see my dreams come past
In my face but how will my friends react
Or my family
Oh, they'd be fancying me
Call me in vanity
Now, my whole life is insanity
It seems either way I lose
Sometimes I want to pull the trigger, be that nigga on the news
But I don't want to know what lifeless is
I plan to have a good life, with no wife and kids
But I'm just tired of the nonsense

You ever given your all but it's still not enough

Cuz I'ma make it, the only option a nigga's got

Recording songs while in the area, triggers pop
They call him protege, next up, guess the kid is hot
Underappreciated, ahead of his time
Without even sketching a dime
Write the cleverest lines
I said we in mind
Anyways, I promise that I'll stop the bragging
Cuz that just leaves the envy and plus a lot of madness
That's why niggas is always broke, we just gots have it
Wearing this watch, that's platinum, but in the heart, that's plastic
And to be completely honest, it don't make no sense
Fucking cop in the chain before you pay your rent
Now the mindset of a dumb, average nigga
And the kids can't starve, he gotta grab the trigga
And it's funny cuz the same ones that's laughing witcha
Will stab you quicker with the pads of scriptures
If that makes them advance to richer

Struggling daily, gon' only have me to run my home

Mind is enslaved, they took my patience and stripped me naked
Can't make excuses cuz niggas strive up for Harvard students
But crashing late in the statements, you know my people doing
Another day, another dollar, tryna pay the rent
Money never well spent
Shit ain't even making sense
I pray to God but knowing damn well he see my flaws
I only call on His name, when I'm just tryna ball
So I hope tomorrow, money just gon' end all my sorrow
So all my hopes and dreams I wanted, we gon' look to ball
I'm an investor in the past, never overnight

New rap phenomenon
Hungry like it's Ramadan
Blowing up, atomic bombs
And Columbine could not respond
Always got a lot of rhymes
Make it cuz I gotta grind
While my team is always fucking winning like we got LeBron
Killing in this rap game
Most of y'all are whack, lame
Won't stop rapping, until I fucking crack fame
Man, I've been passing
Winning is my last name
Snakes in the grass, cuz all the fucking rats came
Coming for my jack cheddar
Where I'm from, they jack cheddar
Hating cuz I rap better
Ski mask, black sweaters
Coming for your father, though
All down, dominos
Vamanos, mama knows
In the room, not a soul
Shower's blowing, gotta go
Feeling like it's '94
Kicking door on shawties, blow
All the sounds your bouta know

I used to have big dreams, go international
But that was just me being dumb, so irrational
I'm radical, I’m lazy, I need to practice more
And why everybody want to be rapping for
And just plain disrespecting the art
I recollect from my heart, guess that's what sets me in part
Still wondering why no labels try to sign me yet
And my rap, reject, for real, I want the respect
And to be next, but I'ma get it and earn it
I can admit that I’m learning, but I'm legit, I deserve it
Now that's just me being optimistic, I want it, I gotta get it
And the doubters that tell me no, they can't stop the vision
And put a sock in it, and stuff it down their esophagus
Swallow it until your screaming out "Yahweh" like you 
Intolerant of critics
But if you ain't putting in the work, you wouldn't get it, admit it
Imagine if you were spitting fire like a dragon or as fly as Aladdin
But every time when you rapping, man they say you're wack man
I swear they can't stand me, I do it for family
But I’ll remember my haters when I’m winning the Grammy

See I'ma make it, that’s a guarantee
See me flying in the crowds, world, look at me

I swear, I seen you at the mall today
I tried to call your name, but you were far away
And when I look into your eyes, I see just stars and space
In the future, please don't Medusa, if you start to snake
Which is why me and my ex, we had to part our ways
She left me for this dude, Tim, I learned a harder way
I was a sucker for love
There would be nothing above
These girls, but I was dumb and that was nothing but lust
But girl, I can tell we headed in the right direction
You got a really nice complexion and you like attention
What explains, you're like extensions
And we can head into the night, ascension
And did I mention
That whenever you smile at me, you take me to a galaxy
Way past the Earth, you made me laugh at first
Which is far different from any other girl, you're so authentic
And in this love game, I'm hard in it, my heart spinning
Not to mention, your elegance and intelligence
Musta been practicing, more blessed than a reverend
And I can tell again
That there was someone else, makes me a jealous man
Heart feeling like gelatin
And no matter for a simile
Can't express the envy that I get, when you not that really into me
Although mentally
It kills me when you say that we really wasn't meant to be
It's like she just want to be friends with me
I swear that kills my drive, yeah, my last gear
Cuz I've been wanting and watching you for the past year
Or at least a few months
I hope you keeping in touch
Because it's a little deeper than lust
And it's a reason to blush
Cuz it's the season to cuff

Straight ahead, I'ma stay in my lane

Add some seasoning and some hot sauce for a better touch
Peanut butter, jelly and syrup sandwich, etcetera
And we just flyin' in the nebula

And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again

My wifey yellin', "Who they?" My daughter yellin', "Hooray"
I see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky
I keep 'em on my block, 'round the corner of my eye
Like a stye (Uh)

So don't you shed a tear
'Cause there'll be better years
I live life by faith, nigga, instead of fear
God cryin', thunderstorms is Heaven tears
The feelin' of lost hope, shit is never here
'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means
A young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things
Age 13, wearin' hand-me-down skinny jeans
You know they a little extra faded around the knees
With the grass stains in 'em
I really wish a little extra cash came in 'em, 'cause a nigga really needed it
Pain, I defeated it, and brought back
Soul survivor, nigga, what you call that?
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it's gon' be alright
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright

Smiling 'cause I'm young, rich, black, and I'm handsome
Not to mention wealthy, ass on her healthy
Young millionaire, what the fuck can you tell me? Smell me?
Nigga, that's Chanel cologne
I'm in Europe with the tourists with no cellular phone

Like ooh, sound like rich nigga problems
I hit a bad bitch with a fistful of condoms
And the randomness of risky ménages
Like get the head right, she can get what she wanted
The spits, then flaunt it, my drip like a faucet
She told me she was prego, I ain't even take the motherfuckin' dick out my pocket, yeah

Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ayy, we like a cold team, nigga, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
Shit, I was like 16, but I can give a sixteen
I can make a bitch scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald bitch, I call her Ms. Clean
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
We party in South Beach, Ferraris and blue cheese

Uh, okay, we all got skeletons in our closet from a shady past
Made me brag about my Mercedes, Jag
Going fast, made me crash
My ex keep fuckin' up my car with her crazy ass
Lately, sad
Reminisce the times, please take me back
Aimin' for the top, I'm on target like a Brady pass
Did a show for eighty cash, and threw it in my lady bag
That was fuckin' easy money, sniper, on my KD swag
Thought about quittin', I'm a warrior, can take the jab
Whoever said shit was easy forever lied
I mesmerize, how simple decisions can jeopardize
When Martin Luther cheated and stared in Coretta's eyes
This is lyrical exercise, told my idols to step aside
My mama said I'm buggin', no need for the pesticides
Was just waitin' tables, gave customers extra fries
Maya Angelou with accounts, I just let it rise
And hopefully my words never die

Wintertime and it's rainin'

Was just in college, strugglin' to get a nice meal
Made it out the gutter, then that's all because of my skills
All because the glory, nigga, let me tell my story
I am not that nigga with potential, I am not a worry
I was lost like Dory, but I'm finally found
Was addicted to the Xans to calm anxiety down
And I never would admit because society clowns
Any nigga with a problem, they can't quiet me now, nigga

Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

I was broke as fuck‚ down up on my ass‚ had the lowest luck
Used to ride the bike up to the store‚ I need a Rover truck
A Bentley coupe, yeah, I'm wearin' Prada‚ I like Fendi too
Grandma passed, had a heart attack, only 62
My cousin shot‚ got me paranoid, who to trust or not
Gave my brother 25 years, that really sucked a lot
Post-traumatic stress is building up, you niggas so dramatic
Fuck these other niggas, I'm the illest, I'm the coldest at it (Yeah, uh)

Let me take you niggas back to a much simpler time
Picture yourself inside a vehicle, a ship in my mind
You'll see some childhood memories mixed with the cells of a don
You'll see the doctor smack my ass when I first fell out my mom
A Magic School Bus adventure trip inside my cerebral
Back when I told niggas I'll make it, swear they didn't believe him
Flashback to Brasstracks and we was playin' "No Problems"
We was crankin' all the classics from the spring to the autumn
And I said motherfuck, need a bad bitch with a tummy tuck
How I make a million from a dollar? It was dummy luck
Need a new Lam', no sedan, fuck a Hummer truck
I'm aiming for the top, I'm steady climbing, fuck a runner-up

Presidential Rollie, fuck a campaign
Impeach, nigga, ten deep, nigga
Remember days we was wearin' J's
And a gold chain, only had three figures
So fortunate, proportionate
Lost Boy, nigga, no coordinates
Remember Christmas? We was giftless
Three foot tree, no ornaments
Pull my dick out, hoes swarmin' it
Flow cold, nigga, no warmin' it
Mama couldn't afford AAU
So we couldn't hoop, nigga, no tournaments
I remember days sippin' lemonade
Ice cream truck gettin' plenty paid
Candy lady had Jolly Ranchers
I don't really have a lot of answers
I'm just searching for the same shit

Okay, uh, I can tell you how I first started in this rap shit
Mama kicked a nigga out the house, felt fantastic
Told my homies, "If you got a couch, know I'm crashin'
Worried 'bout my future, couldn't care about the past tense
Lost my grandmother, and I haven't been the same since
Start to get anxious, I'm tired of this lame shit
Tired of the struggle, livin' family in the subdivision
Ramen noodles, drawin' doodles wasn't in my fuckin' vision
But who's fault is that? Tryna stay all intact
Fightin' all my demons, they be schemin' but I'm crawlin' back
And eventually flyin', lately been mentally cryin'
Niggas resentin' me, I am not for the industry lyin'

Life's a dream, but nothin' is a fairytale
Do you love me? I can barely tell
'Cause I'm up and down, been all around, nobody's callin' now
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Uh, 'cause I know what I been through
But I still, uh, I'd do it all over again

We was makin' high school classics
Before I took a kilo and I wrapped it, I rapped it
Around the funeral with the casket (Yuugh!)
Coke avalanche, like a landslide
Only grew my hair this long because my man died
Collect calls on them landlines, I pressed 5
To tell about the new test drive and talk fly, ooh

Life's a dream, but nothin' is a fairytale

Yeah, God bless the dreamchasers
If you got a dream, keep chasin' it
Never let nobody here trap your dreams
You gon' make it, yeah

I could've died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like, "Wait a minute'"
She know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it

See I know how it feels on the late nights, swimmin' with the great whites
Drownin' in the deep waters, know you got three daughters
Could use some resources, nah, we just need order
I got my own bad news, fuck a reporter
Niggas ain't even safe, they wanna deport us
Or rather keep us boxed in on the street corners
If you gon' stop and frisk a nigga, shit, at least warn us
My dawg still on probation, they got a leash on us
Far from stupid, in fact, I'm smarter than Harvard students
Sparked a movement and put an end to this garbage music

Did it on my own, I got myself here
When God asked me do I want this shit? I said, "Hell yeah"
I'm ready, when I put the crown on, it was heavy
I was drownin' in my past like when Katrina broke the levees in New Orleans
In my city, to them kids, I'm like Jordan
Every move I make like chess, it's important
I just went against the system, spending nights tryna reform it
Lay at night thinkin' I could lose my life just from doin' this
It's a sacrifice, I know it wouldn't be right if I forfeit
But I do it for the young kings that never had no voices, for real

7-Eleven runs, Gatorade flavor lemon-lime
Hot Cheetos, Arizonas, oranges, clementine
The first job I ever applied for was Finish Line
Sometimes a nigga be forgettin', then remember I'm
Savior of the rap shit, the leader of the renaissance
Self-appointed, well anointed for my endeavors
I'm eyein' cheddar, applyin' pressure, defyin' set-ups
The rap game is based upon what niggas lyin' better
If truth is told, then you can grow and dyin' never
No, I'm everlastin', better graspin' this thing in life
I heard Meek hook and I told him to sing it twice, my God

Yeah, I was a lost boy, now I'm found
Niggas switched up, they can't come around
See these rap niggas biting my sound
Shout out my bitch for holdin' it down
I had to switch up my lifestyle
If she bad, I'ma go and fuck her lights out
Mama always told me I was a bright child
Naked pictures saved on my iCloud
My goodness, my God, my gracious
Got a bad little bitch, my favorite
And I eat the pussy like it's caviar
Nigga, I ain't talkin' 'bout that playlist
Most necessary, cold February
Flow never buried, shit is everlastin'
Opportunity is never passin'
Was just in school skippin' hella classes
New whip, hit the pedal thrashin'
Grew up where I heard the metal blastin'
I know that greed is the devil's passion
He wears Prada and stiletto fashion
Gucci has become the ghetto fashion
I am just another rebel rappin'
But that studio time led to Louis Vuitton
That I just bought for my mom
Celebration, mix Ciroc and a lime
Rest in peace X, the Pac of his time
Was manifested, can't stop the divine
The nigga speakin' like Barack in his prime
But I'm Bill Clinton with these ill writtens, make the real listen
Seen Monica Lewinsky in the Hills drippin'
Hours later, call me Mike Jones 'cause I'm still tippin'
Call up Scotty with the shotty, 'cause I feel Pippen
I'm a real fresh prince, Uncle Phil, listen
And tell Will Smith how I kill shit
And to please adopt a young nigga
Man, I'm tryna get real rich
Nah I'm playin', shout out to Jaden
So iconic how I go Super Saiyan
New bitch foreign, straight from the Himalayans
On top soon, Lord knows I been prayin'
'Cause I'm on my grind, watch how I kickflip
Money notorious, I'm buyin' big shit
God is so glorious, bless me with riches
I was just broke, now I'm a rich kid
Gas what I smoke, that shit is vicious
Give me that throat, say it's delicious
Rappers is jokes, I'm a musician
Rappers is jokes, I'm a musician, huh

Spit hot lava, erode the beat, my God

Yep, mmh
No mother

I think I could do better, but I still
I want this forever
Uh, sometimes life's about the people you know
Watchin' a flower bloom as its features will grow
I mean, I never been one to preach to them folks
I'm just speakin' from experience, my teachings is dope
Learning lessons with my brethren, joy is quite contagious
Counting blessings on blessings, my heart right to make it
And it's kinda my only option, maybe my decisions
Haven't really been the best, but this my life I'm livin'
Although it seem so bittersweet when you ain't got nothing to eat
And Sallie Mae callin' your phone for like the fifth time this week
All your bills overdue, all your bitches over you
Only one option remains, you just gotta show and prove

And so I know, little darling
I know how the pain, it hurts
Say something to me sweetie
We'll get through, we'll make it work

And you've caught me down bad, I say

Her black eye as I cried, it's a daily thing, uh
And here I am chasin' dreams
Ignorant with bliss, worryin' 'bout plays and streams
The crazy part is they don't even say a thing
They don't want me to worry, just go and make the cream
I got an aunt with a cheatin' husband, always knew he bogus
Used to wear turtlenecks and some Louis loafers
Comin' home to family struggles got me losin' focus
I don't know how else to deal so it's too late now

Family be matterin' most, but as a catalyst

Said it was her substitute for never gettin' a man
Said we all need love, only if it's in the plan
Forced love the worst love, throw that shit in the can
I got an auntie who a prostitute, it hurt my soul
Promise you sellin' your body ain't worth that gold
Reverse that role, you don't gotta swerve that road

All they tell me is, "Nigga, go excel in your dreams"

Yeah, it be the ones that's closest

You ever have a love for something and it's taken away?
Tryin' so hard to forget all of the pain and mistakes
Don't know how much fuckin' stress that my brain can it take
On top forever 'cause I'm so afraid of fadin’ away
This music shit my love and passion
That's why I fell in love with rappin’
God forbid something happens, y'all still have my rhymes
Even though y’all didn't fuckin’ listen half the time
Got my reason, comeback season, dawg, I had to grind
I mean this shit is not a hobby, waitin’ out hours in the lobby
Ain’t no labels tryna sign me, but I’m flowin' like tsunamis
Through the struggles through the grimy, I’ma make it out
Couple years, there's no debate that I’m the greatest out
Better yet, just admit it now
Split the reel and switch the style
Niggas pay attention now, nobody is ill around
And when I say that "Nobody fuckin’ hot as me"
I’m not even being cocky, that's just honesty

All I wanna do is chase my dream
Gotta make it, everybody’s fuckin’ hatin’ me, oh
I can’t take it, oh no, I can’t take it
I can’t take it, well, no, I can’t take it
It’s crazy that I can’t trust my friends
Let me know when the lust will end
‘Cause it’s killin’ me

Can’t believe it when my niggas gettin’ sprayed with Berettas
And meanwhile the school's collectin’ they fuckin’ checks
We get a fancy sheet of paper with a bunch of debt
Man, that don’t sound right
Its like your fuckin’ whack ass music, it just don’t sound right

And my life turnin' into hell nah
Oh man, shit gettin' way hectic
Nothing ever go my way
Off life I'm stressing, burnt out off five J's

But through the storm we ride waves, oh man
We gon' make it, yeah, I got no other choice

I swear that I might just put rap in a crisis
And then all the madness, these niggas is average
I know that I'm  it's all in a bad sense
But on to another note, like buying my mother's 
And all of the people doubting, I swear y'all can fuckin' choke
But I don't promote violence, got niggas who tote irons
They flexing and most lying
The idols got ghost writers, this shit is crazy
It seem like the world is falling apart
Don't gotta worry 'bout my shit, man, it's all from the heart
I mean you niggas know I'm real, I been raw from the start
I seen through the light, that's why I'm standin' tall in the dark

Ooh-ah, ooh
Crack rock, crack rock

Ooh, would you agree?
Would you agree?

Uh, I think about you all the time, just too afraid to say it
And wonder if you would be mine if a nigga make it
But would you love me for the real or are you plotting faking
Tryna make a quick buck, count a thousand faces
What if a nigga go broke, will you still like me?
If I ain't have a million dollars would you feel feisty?
It's real likely you'd leave me fast for someone richer
A ball player, a rapper, maybe another nigga
It's something with you that keep me drawing, a loving picture
You're picture perfect and all the extra shit is worth it
I make some verses for the grind, I got a bigger purpose
I promise that it's all coming with expensive purses
Exquisite purchase, anything that your heart desire
I try not to ever argue 'cause you spark a fire
Within my heart you shoot a dart, girls the smartest liars
You say you love it when I switch it to my sharp attire
And so I  I buy her Michael Kors
I say "Girl, anything that you like is yours
And all your words strike  sword"
She said "I never would talk if you drive a Ford"

I'm not rich but time, I can invest that
And you just wanna be friends, I'll take a step back
She start to tell me that my attitude is unattractive
And that designer and material just doesn't matter
This whole fling is crazy, it's got us running backwards
And we ain't going nowhere climbing a hundred ladders
But I promise you I'm better than that other man
But the way you got me in is a troubled stance
If you saw me counting rubber bands
But I'm not, in fact a nigga struggling
I gotta need for money and I hate to ask
Ask me to scoop you, girl, you gotta pay for gas
Tell you a couple jokes for the sake to laugh
But we going nowhere and that's just facing facts

Drum a kit like they do karate
I be the first never lied in rap
I am a great, no denying that
I spit the higher than fire tracks
I can't wait to blow up and they say he inquire racks
I switch a style and make it easy
I changed my friends 'cause they was greedy
I'm making money, they pay to meet me
I give a fuck if a hater scheming
I gotta grind to make every dollar
My money stronger than Larry Lobster
I work with magic, that Harry Potter
You niggas scary, they bury yoppas
That money all on my mind
Never stolen with time but I ball like LeBron
Labels calling my line but I never answered
Diesel jeans 
Bad hoes get to belly dancing
Stealing styles get you reprimanded
Screaming rest in peace, it's forever branded
Had to kill the beat causing hella damage, like woah
Niggas would say I'm the hottest topic
What's on my mind is a lot of profit (Cash)
Never sold dope til I got to college
This is not me, man, I gotta stop it
Hit my bro  'cause he got the loud
Stack up them pennies, no Oscar Proud
You smoking dutches, you out of style
Bro keep attacking, that's not a foul
Semi-automatic, I was never packing
Boxing all these haters, I am everlasting

Roof on my coop  so I'm dropping it, woo

Ayy, Will, hold up bro
We ain't even done yet fool, ayy

Nigga I was deep in a deadly drought
Was never worried 'bout getting heavy clout
Fuck a Jaguar, bring the Chevy's out
Niggas want the fame and I'm ready now
'Cause I'm heavy gifted, make a well-decision

Screaming fuck the prison, it's a failing system
Free my little bro, ring the bell to listen

And my niggas kick it like we be punters
I'm a college kid with a street wonder
Niggas looking for me but they Steve Wonder
Got a lot of dimes like Steve numbers

Need a new girl and her ass bigger

See, I was twelve years with the Tommy fit
Fifteen, crankin' "Bobby Bitch"
I was seventeen years on this Earth
When I popped a Perc', made my body itch
Need a pound of blow when I'm drownin' slow

We was slap-boxin', no Karate Kid
Start to see the difference with a lotta shit
And my grandma got a lotta kids
Bought whips foreign, no mileages
Hit Saks Fifth and got a Prada fit
But I still got a lotta wallet
Shit, nigga, this the shit that I asked for
'Member last year I was mad poor

Now she down to fly, she got a passport

Went to prison with 'em, doin' business with ’em
I'm twenty-one, my cellmate been down for thirty-five
He just tryna see the sun before he gotta die
So why would I go and cry? Got another passion (Bitch)
You don't know the struggle, so you wouldn't understand
'Cause in my book, my mama raised a man
'Cause I could've snitched on the beat to get me out the can
But I could tell you what I seen or what I lived, it's up to you
Or let my brother tell the story from a bird's-eye viewYou might also like3Embed
Yeah, uh

Brink of extinction, hell-bent on survival
This life's a continuous cycle
Consider this a venomous haiku
This ain't a verse, nigga
And I done dealt with the worst niggas
The type to steal your shit and search with ya
Nothing ordinary
I been having vivid dreams, them shits is more than scary
Graveyards or mortuaries
Haunted by these goals that I'm tryna accomplish
Underrated, over-hated, I'm tired of the nonsense
Things I've could've done better, it lies in my conscience
And I'll never forget it, I'm my worst critic
Such a overthinker, I'm so self-reflective
God willing, these parables go and sell some records
Politicians out here lying, tryna sell a message
Ten thousand hours, penmanship is well-perfected
Uh, I'm just tryna get my point across
And on my mama, I will die for the right cause
Mmm, 'cause what's life without sacrifice?
And you just wasting talent if you never strategize
Stared death in the face with the saddest eyes
Taking risks, situations getting magnified
What's your ideal way of demise?
The price of fame costs your life, but staying alive was more important
Uh, death is the greatest surprise
I see the hate in your eyes
I saw potential at first, grew a resentment for Earth
You lust for power too much
And it's getting worse
The more you get, the more that you'll desire, can't quench your thirst
Of a conqueror, ask Alex, ask Christopher
Seven figure checks, they require my signature
Drive-by shootings, homicides are vehicular
Now fuck your art critic, can't decide what my picture's worth
I just know that it's painted well
Your favorite artist first priority is gaining wealth
Mmm, sprinkle holy water on a tainted cell
My brother asked me how the fuck can he maintain in Hell
Mmm, that's another story for a different day
He just told me, "Don't switch your ways," niggaYou might also like6Embed

I was riding through my momma's hood, rollin' in Jeep
I ain't playin' with you niggas, boy, I'm playin' for keeps
Fuck you pussy ass niggas tryna prey on the weak
I ain't talkin' too much, I only say what I mean
I bring the whole city out every time that I'm home
How you all about business but don't be mindin' your own? (Yeah)
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna atone, huh
I let that be well known, yeah

Daydreamin' while I'm schemin' on a text
Steady plottin' as I'm thinkin' on the next (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Confident although I find myself compressed
Overthinking, worrying, I must confess (Yeah, yeah, yеah, yeah)
Even though sometimеs I wish I was exaggerating
And all my problems were just figments of imagination
The smartest nigga who had dropped out, fuck your graduation
I think that shit a fuckin' scam, somebody had to say it
Caught up in a matrix, shit I had to find a way out
Lost too many niggas, swear this shit is gettin' played out
Student loan forgiveness, all my debt was finally paid out
Appreciate this shit because the gutter I come straight out
The bottoms of bottoms, to the top of the tops
And that power washing van that I just bought for my pops
I talk to him every now and then, more often than not
We upgraded next time that I drop, but for now

I heard the cage bird sing and it's a beautiful sound
And it'd be so much fuckin' better, dog, if you was around
Why they had to kill my nigga over a few little pounds?
When I got robbed in high school you even flew to the town
Couldn't really live with him, now I'm livin' without him
And you was just here with us listenin' to the new album
Told me that it was a classic, better than my last shit
We used to have hoop dreams and skip all our classes
And now my nigga dead and gone, shed these tears up in this song
Shoulda got 'em out, I right my wrong, real niggas shit what I condone
Every nigga got his flaws, accounts that's filled with withdrawals
I paint pictures that's vivid because my feeling so raw
This shit I'm dealing with, uh, is no mistake
That I was put in this position just to open gates
The niggas with the least to offer the most to say
The funeral was too much, I couldn't show my face, instead
I was riding through my momma's hood, rollin' in Jeep
I ain't playin' with you niggas, boy, I'm playin' for keeps
Fuck these pussy ass niggas tryna prey on the weak

This song is dedicated to my dog Juwan Walls
They called him Pit
Who got killed last summer in a shootout
And um, we used to be on the basketball team together, man, me and him
We always used to hoop together
And um, bro was the first one gettin' money amongst us all, like
He was like fifteen, sixteen years old
And he-he always kept a bankroll on him, and uh
I just miss my dog, man2Embed

Okay, what do you want from me? What do you need?
I'm only a human, baby, and we all bleed
Never live with vices or destroy with greed
I'm a man with pride, I won't beg or plead
Just ask, what do you want from me?
Is it ever enough?

Ayy check it, check it, check it
Men and women are quite different though our vision is jaded
We originated to coexist however you play it
Woman was made from that man's rib, that's why we can't live
You be the judge, but ain't no Uncle Phil without an Aunt Viv
Mother Nature and Father Time, moonlight and sunshine
Everything's interconnected and it's all by design
Yin and yang and since the big bang, ain't shit change
Sometimes I feel like Russell Wilson, other days I'm Rick James
Life is a balance, duality is one of my talents
If you ask me to express myself that's gon' be a challenge
When I bought that Birkin bag I had to ask my accountant
He said "Hell nah," but mustard seed faith move mountains
Bad decisions will derive from you just being in love
She ain't the type who out all night that you could see in the club
We both share the same problems, we got too much pride

The missing pieces, this written thesis, I can't advise
Improper inner circles, gotta sanitize
I clean house 'cause some only like to vandalize
Plotting on your downfall although I plan to rise
Life's your biggest fuckin' test and this ain't standardized
Quite remedial, the type to see it through
I write for me and you, accomplish shit that isn't feasible
Now what would Jesus do? Fish and bread to the masses
In terms of gettin' head I was the head of my classes
Yin to my yang like the feds and harassment
Everything good, my nigga, like why you asking?
Beware of ulterior motives, deeper desires
My whole catalog, I'm keeping the fire
My mom still go to work everyday, can't wait til she can retire
I keep it real and that's what people admire, they ask

Money on my mind, nigga, I got to grind today
Get that shit andale
Told my brothers, "You ain't gotta worry, I'ma find a way"
Shit gon' line in place
Hopped off the porch too early what my mama say
My card ain't decline today
Sun gon' shine, nigga, sun gon' shine today

I remember them cold nights
Ninth grade, Chief Keef first dropped "Don't Like"
Why the time had to go by?
Eatin' free lunch at the school, used to roll dice
I remember I ain't have shit (I ain't have it)
I was broke as fuck, put that shit in the past tense (Nah, for real)
Check out my Jag' tints (For real)
Had to boss up, nigga can't live averagе
How the fuck niggas still broke? (What the fuck?)
Put it on my mеn, nigga, put it on my lil' bros
Need a Brazil ho
2003, my cousin taught me how to heel toe
Swear I ain't dance since (For real)
Shit going up, nigga, watch how I transcend
Don't need no damn friends (Hi Level)

Mm, drippin' feng shui, yeah
Singin' to 'em like Sade, yeah

Drinkin' holy water, givin' praise to God like Kanye
Had to take the harder way
Now I'm doing shows, rockin' New Zealand, me and Cordae
Back in Australia, mate
I done paved a wave, even left them a trail to trace
Police tryna build a case
I'm just thankin' God I ain't stressin' 'bout bills to pay
I ain't havin' nothin' bad to say
Bank account loaded, got a half a mil' cash in the safe
We was gettin' it way back in the day

I used to dream about a Dodge Charger
Suicide doors, sittin’ on 24's
I was tryna find a job, but shit, why bother?
Being broke can make you try harder

Plottin' on this fuckin' Cartier, hey
Plus a nigga tryna go farther
I finally arrived and nobody's here, hey

I used to dream about a new Hummer
Back when G.O.O.D. Music dropped Cruel Summer
Back when niggas wondered if I'd do numbers
Check the stats, boy, a nigga doing huge numbеrs
Got this dime piece suckin' on my cucumbеr
I ain't doin' too bad for a newcomer
This life shit gave me scars with a bruise under, hm
Certain shit will make you wonder (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But that’s a part of the game we call life, love is hard to attain
My lil’ brother drive a Jeep and I just bought him a chain
A real nigga what I'm is and what I always remain
But this bitch temptation keep callin’ my name
I wrote this song in LA, I was driving my Benz
Thinking 'bout this road I'm on to acquiring ends
I'm a fuckin’ outlier, I retire these trends
Niggas told me I was stupid just for hiring friends (Huh, but, uh)

Okay
Listen to these proverbs, the odd words we call rap music
That took me all across the globe, watch people react to it
Figments of imagination, couldn't fathom elation
Ain't describable with words, so I'll go illustrate it
Illustrious rhymin' career, for which my rhymes are revered
Clear signs of alignment shows my timing is near
We all here for an assignment, severals souls that are migrant
Simply vessels in this climate, solitary confinement
I break free every time that I wake
My fate bleeds and create seeds that eventually blossom to trees
Getting rid of all the extra shit I thought I would need
I put your head on the swivel, wear my heart on the sleeve
But just breathe, the simple exercise can even rectify
Our greatest sins, although my days won't end next to God
I atone for all of my wrongs throughout songs
But let him who is without sin go cast the first stone, motherfucker
