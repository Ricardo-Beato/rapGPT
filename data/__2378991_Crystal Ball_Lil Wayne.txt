14 ContributorsCrystal Ball Lyrics
I know 'round the world I be gettin' to the money
She crazy for the dick and I'm addicted to the money
It's a dirty world and my cup too, it's so muddy
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money
My lady talkin' crazy, I done listened to the money
She crazy bout this dick and I'm addicted to the money
I gotta watch that bitch, she must be in it for the money
Long story short, I'mma pimp before a dummy

I ain't got high expectations I'm just expecting my money
If I don't get my check, I'm gonna be chin-checkin' for nothin'
If I don't get my check, I'm gonna be chin-checkin' in public
Long story short, I'm just gettin' to the money
Long story short, I'mma keep it short and sweet
I get to the money, I don't let it get to me
All my niggas ballin', it's the way this shit should be
I pull up on my darlin' and I lay the dick and leave
She'll thank you for comin'
I'll put that dick in her stomach
You put that cash on the dresser for her
You take the bitch out to restaurants
You took the bitch out the reservoir
And took the bitch straight to the fuckin' mall
I get higher than cholesterol
I see money in my crystal ball
You might also like
I see money in my crystal ball
Only answer when my niggas call
Hello, what up nigga
Ringtone 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls
Countin' money, listenin' to 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls
Got steph walkin' round in the house
In nothing but a thong and I'm in my drawers
I mean can I ball
I don't mean no home
I don't need no home
But niggas got their hands out and I don't read no palms

I know these niggas is pussy
I know these niggas is pussy
I know these niggas is lookin'
I know these niggas is payin' attention
I know these bitches got bad intentions
But I just want my money
I just want my money
Got 'em
I'm startin' to feel like wavin' shotties
Started from the bottom, nigga

Tryna break me off, you better break me off some money
Talkin' bout you love me? Better show me with the money
Show up at my door? Better show up with the money
Take me somewhere nice? It better be private and sunny
I got what you want, you got what I need
I just take the check and let you take the lead
I might take some shots, I might hit the weed
Put a dollar sign at the beginning of Stephanie
Mula
I see money in my crystal ball
I'm bout to bust open this crystal ball
What up nigga?
Ringtone 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls
Countin' money, listenin' to 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls
Got stuff walkin' round in the house
And I'm a dog and I'm in my drawers
I mean can I ball
I don't mean no home
I don't need no home
But niggas got their hands out and I don't read no palms

Spendin' spaniel, wasted cause my nigga hustle for me
I'm outchea with my girls and we turnin' up for nothin'
So close with all my brothers and so far away from ugly
Racin' in my new car, I see new friends actin' funny
Spendin' spaniel, wasted cause my nigga hustle for me
Break my heart? I break the bank boy, I'm Young Money
All these niggas round me are my brothers, are my brothers
They'll kill anybody if they fuck with me, I love 'em
They'll kill anybody if they fuck with me, I love 'em
All these niggas round me are my brothers
Break my heart? I break the bank boy, I'm Young Money
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money
I be gettin' to the money2Embed
