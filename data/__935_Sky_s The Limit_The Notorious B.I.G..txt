Baby, look at me
Mama love you
And I know you ain't no little boy no more
But you'll always be my baby
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms
Now look at you now, Biggie
But I worry about you
I worry about you all the time
Hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold onto that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, ‘cause the sky's the limit

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight? (Alright)
I'd like to welcome to the stage (Alright, alright)
The lyrically acclaimed, ha (Woo)
I like this young man, because when he came out (Hahahaha)
He came out with the phrase:
He went from ashy to classy — haha, I like that (Alright, alright)
So everybody in the house give a warm
(Uh) Round of applause for The Notorious
B.I.G, ha
The Notorious B.I.G, ladies and gentlemen
Give it up for him, y'all!

Uh
A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pinstripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewin' tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You wanna see the inside? Huh, I see ya later
Here comes the drama
"Oh, that's that nigga with the fake"
Blaow! "Why you punch me in my face?" Stay in your place
Play your position (Uh), here come my intuition (Uh-huh)
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with 'em, stole with 'em
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies — butter crunch
'88 Oshkosh and blue and white dunks, pass the blunt

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés, pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Begin to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart
Break it down into sections, drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustler's Prayer:
"If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand"
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase "Sky's the limit"
Motherfucker, see you chumps on top

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on83Embed
