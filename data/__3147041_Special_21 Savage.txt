In my feelings, she got me in my feelings
She got me in my feelings (For real)
She got me in my feelings (For real)
Got me in my feelin' (For real)
She got me in my feelings (For real)
She got me in my feelings (For real)
Got meâ€”
Wheezy Beats

She got me in my feelings (For real)
Buy a brand new Bentley (For real)
Buy her new Chanel (For real)
I don't kiss and tell (No)
Her diamonds raindrop (Yeah)
Stay down when the fame stop (Yeah)
She be scratchin' on my tank top
Real niggas gon' make the pain stop
Baby, is you gon' ride with me 'til the wheels off? (21)
Baby, you gon' calm me down when I'm pissed off (21)
I'm a savage, so your panties might get ripped off (Take 'em off)
Your ex didn't know how to appreciate you, now he missed out

We got somethin' special
We got somethin' special
We got somethin' special
We got somethin' special
I was finna text you
But I ain't wanna pest you
Even if we ain't together (No matter, we're forever)
I'm still comin' to your rescue
You might also like
Put you in that coupe
Put you in Jimmy Choo (21)
Birkin bag (Yeah), twenty-five thousand on the tag (Yeah)
Put you on a private jet (Yeah)
We ain't never ridin' first class (Yeah)
And we havin' sex in the air (Yeah)
Man, I hope the pilot don't crash (Yeah)
Hard to find a bad bitch to stay true to me (21)
Who gon' spend them late nights in the booth with me?
Got a gutter bitch, she pullin' up to shoot with me
If you can't stay down, then you ain't gon' reap the fruits with me
Coke bottle model and she like to swallow
Pussy so good, I give her all my guala (All my money)
I got your back forever, put that on my partner (On God)
You ain't gotta pay no bills, you found my heart

We got somethin' special
We got somethin' special (Yeah)
We got somethin' special
We got somethin' special
I was finna text you
But I ain't wanna pest you
Even if we ain't together (No matter, we're forever)
I'm still comin' to your rescue
Ride with me (Ride with me)
Tell the truth and don't you lie to me (Lie to me)
You know I need you on my side with me (Side with me)
Tell the truth and don't you lie to me (Lie to me)
Baby, roll with me (Roll with me)
Jump in that coupe and, baby, coast with me (Coast with me)
If I was broke, she kickin' doors with me (Doors with me)
Baby, roll with me, roll with me (21)
I'ma hold you down forever, you my round forever
They just want to use you, but I'm tryna help you
Savage tryna build, they just tryna feel
Really ain't none of their business, we got somethin' real

We got somethin' special
We got somethin' special
We got somethin' special
We got somethin' special
I was finna text you
But I don't wanna pest you
Even if we ain't together (No matter, we're forever)
I'm still comin' to your rescue4Embed
