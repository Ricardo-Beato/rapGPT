3 ContributorsOn The Run Lyrics

You know my weapons conventional, blow a hole in you, folding you
Be the death of you, every do, last view'll be arial
Put the Range on off road, the woods to bury you
Never question my M.O., or the ammo I carry a state
Crime or federal, task force to battle you
Faggots know what the lead'll do, put ya vest on daddy
Them slugs'll burn like verenial, off top to carry you
Dirty laundry, we airing you, respect my gangsta, it's savvy
You little raps don't grab me, the truth'll hurt for they addy
They drink the drink and rade the pain, to build some courage to clap me
Give a fuck if they tellin' you, more the merry, I'm married to guns
Muhfucka, polygamous nigga, they vary
Being need of some medical, livin' life as vegetable
Take that, think about it and don't try nothin' fancy
Make a move and I'll level you, like a bomb with atomic forces
Niggas betta pray and kiss they crosses
Holy water to bless you, them slugs will tear through your tissue
And clog the fuck outta a vassel, got you seeing me crystal
Niggas sweatin' in they sleep, I got 'em sleepin' with pistols
I'm the dope, you the fiend, fuckin' right, I'm fiction

Shot a nigga from frontin', I'm on the run now
Nigga try to fuck with my hustle, I'm on the run now
Used to gettin' paper, I'm touchin', I'm on the run now
Life is so good, nigga, push me, I'm on the run now
You might also like
Nigga be duckin' and slidin', cuz they know we providin'
All the shots for they night, they on us, we got it
It's on us, you can put ya money back ya pocket
Keep ya chains and ya watches, this is deeper than robbing
I want your soul muthafucka, see you deep in some shit
Now you catchin' and shifts, and now I'm ready to flip
Without a thought, now we up in the whips
We pay our own music, yeah, yo, we all on our dicks
Got these bitches nose open, they be breezin' and fiendin'
Got her shootin' at people, mad cuz they do leave them
They can't believe it, now my car change with the seasons
When the spring, summer, fall, the truck droppin' the t-rex
I be boatin' and flying, strapped in when I'm driving
Be on the side walking off, we truly be wilding
They got billions behind 'em, still can't fuck with our rhyming
And these songs overpower, where shit they frontin'
