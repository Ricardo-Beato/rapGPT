27 ContributorsJah World Lyrics
Him speaketh in tongues into the hearts of all flesh
Yeah stanyoi
Whoi

Oh God, I beg for forgiveness
So help me Lord, yes I beg for forgiveness
Deep in my heart, please, I'm crying for forgiveness
Allah U Akbar, I fall to my knees for forgiveness
Branded by the steel iron, bullets flying
Ladies being hit through wickedness, I'm losing my grip
I thought we lived by the books, The Bible, Qu'ran
We pick cotton, my back is still hot and dark and
They threw burners in our babies' faces
Pale hands that looked scary touched our bodies in the strangest places
Sweat from the white man's head
Fell on our daughters as she cried, giving white man head
Almighty, alrighty, niggas is screwing
God won't you tell me why these ho niggas is screwing?
I'm sorry father, sacrifice me, leave me wife
Sacrifice me twice, so my kids can see paradise...

So we heed our God king Selassie I, Jehovah God, Jah Rastafari
Who is seated in Zion and reigneth in all
In the hearts of all flesh - whoa wow
Let my task oh Jah with them that strive with me
Fight against them - whoa wow
That fight against me - whoa wow
Take hold thy shield and rock and stand up for my health
Oh Jah, oh Jah, only you can comfort me
La la la, la la la la la, la la la la
La la la whoi stand out

Curse to the wicked snakes who try to snatch the truth away
Cursed be the ones who try to take our youth away
Peace to the black, the brown, the red, yellow, and white seed
We don't discriminate man over color, creed
They tried to snatch up our beats, son, and steal our culture
And German Catholics, whitewashing Roman sculptures
How dare you try to deny Allah's intelligence?
Kidnap the truth, and destroying the black evidence

Glory be to the Father
Glory be to the Son (Glory be to the Holy One)
Glory be to the Holy One
The holder of creation whoi
As Jah was in the beginning is now and forever shall be
Jah world... Jah world without end whoi
So we heed our God king Selassie I, Jahova God, Jah Rastafari
Who is seated in Zion and reigneth in the hearts of
In the hearts of all flesh whoi4Embed
