6 ContributorsShut Up Bitch Intro LyricsAh, Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please?
It has come to my attention that you raggedy bitches always got a muthafucking
Opinion about somebody, what somebody shoulda been doing, what they
Shoulda been wearing, what they shoulda been doing with their motherfucking money
Why don't you get a muthafucking life, bitch?
You been raggedy since Lil' Kim first came out and your ass is still raggedy
That's why you got time to worry about what other muthafuckers is doing
It's queen B bitch. Not pawn, not rook, not knight. QUEEN
You ain't no muthafucking royalty
As a matter of fact, just do me a favor and shut up bitch. I don't even like bitches talking
Beh, wait, hold on - let me say something to you:
This is what you're doing, and this is what I need you to be doing...
See, watch, hold on..........
See, even I can do it, EVEN A PIMP CAN DO IT!
Did you see how I shut up? That's what the fuck you need to do and SHUT THE FUCK UP, BITCH!You might also like1Embed
