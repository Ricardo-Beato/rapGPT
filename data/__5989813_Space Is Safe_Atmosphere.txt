6 ContributorsSpace Is Safe Lyrics
Even if we both believe in change
We will need these memories erased
Keep it in a space that's safe
Keep me in a space that's safe

You said that you're concerned that I suffer from depression
I said that I think you're reaching for a weapon
And honestly you probably right
But not tonight, satan, you obviously want me to fight
Like that's the ah that you're thirsting for
Maybe that's the only thing I've got worth working for
I said, "Baby, you don't wanna see me freestyle"
She said, "Maybe you should just go to sleep now"

Even if we both beliеve in change
We will need thеse memories erased
Keep it in a space that's safe
Keep me in a space that's safe

You said that my ear to the door, knee to the floor
Trying to listen for the clicks, crack the code like a high score
I might even whisper, I'm trying to be speechless
The amplified voice is just a sign of our weakness
We act like we're trying to push it over the edge
But some of y'all don't even use soap on your legs
Got a lot of excuses to stop what you're doing
Phone died trying to binge-watch the revolution
You might also like
Even if we both believe in change
We will need these memories erased
Keep it in a space that's safe
Keep me in a space that's safe8Embed
