14 ContributorsTell Nobody Lyrics
I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
You my girl and I ain't gon never tell nobody
I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
I'ma ride it right, Imma do it slow, yeah
I won't tell nobody no
I won't tell nobody no
Ain't gone tell nobody no
I won't tell nobody no

Bitches want to fuck a Thug
Bitches want to be my girl
Bitches need to find their love
Bitches want to kill these sluts
Leaving Onyx, pocket full of Magic City money
Body perfect, thick, her hips look like a dummy
Far from worthless, chrome hearts specs got me looking real nerdy
When she leave from Thug world
No longer do she want a motherfucker earthling
Throw that pussy at the Thug, I might miss
Tryna hit it
I want it too bad, do what ever to get it
She don't care about no cash, make you feel small like a midget
Just like Shawty Lo, baby let's g-g-get it
You might also like
I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
You my girl and I ain't gon never tell nobody
I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
I'ma ride it right, Imma do it slow, yeah
I won't tell nobody no
I won't tell nobody no
Ain't gone tell nobody no
I won't tell nobody no

OG  want to be
I just made your girl my new main thing
You a  that red head
Tell  I'm from the 
Chain of blood around your jewelry, look like you Soo-Woo
You got everything, we need more of you
You thick like cameltoe, ooh
Look at that  on her, make a nigga put his head on her
 throw these bands on her, fuck around put my name on her

I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
You my girl and I ain't gon never tell nobody
I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
I'ma ride it right, Imma do it slow, yeah
I won't tell nobody no
I won't tell nobody no
Ain't gone tell nobody no
I won't tell nobody no1Embed
