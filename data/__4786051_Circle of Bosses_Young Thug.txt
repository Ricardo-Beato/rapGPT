Wheezy outta here
Wee, woo
Woo-ooh, ooh

Divide the shooters (Divide)
Then split up the house
Intruder, the West Wing (Intruder)
They knockin' ya off (Blaow)
The AP a Mille, the baguette
It spilled, just look at the frost (Look at the 'guetty)
Pull all of my whips out
I make the North look a little awesome (Skrrt, skrrt)
The circle of bosses (Go)
Pussy, you better not cross us (Circle of bosses)
We asked your bitch (Yeah)
Her pussy be wetter than faucets (Ask, ask)
I close my fist (Close)
My ice, it make an announcement (Ice, ice)
I raise a brick (Brick)
Make her go hike on a mountain (Uh)

She got Eliantte on her neck
Light blue, all the hunduns, let it spread
I told her it's nap time, with the red
Rolls Royce, Forgiato, what I said
Sippin' lean, but got no sinus
I could turn to a mad scientist
Board a jet in like any climate
Bitches tryna come over and dine in
Throw 11 like Matt Ryan
Most my bitches and me are tight and
Hurt her heart with no Neosporin, then
I'ma watch it like WiFi
You might also like
Clear water on her neck, nigga, don't see the shark (Ice, splash)
Back to back, double R trucks, no key to park it (Double R)
Name the location, we mark it (Hey)
We gotta move the smartest (Move)
I got a K in my office (Brra)
You ever seen a carcass? (Body)
Growed up to be an arsoner (Fire)
Breathin' out fire, like oxygen
McLaren, it came equipped (Skrrt)
Pressin' the gas, and exhaust the whip
We get the strain and dip (Strain)
Can't pull up on me, come get your chips (Cash)
Heard car got flipped (Flipped)
They might pull up on you with sticks in the Lyft

Hey, I'm countin' these racks up in the bed
I still took the pill, didn't know what it said
They catering Activis at the weddin'
I travel with the Draco or the 'chete
You think that she straight
I'm turnin' her gay, got her kissin' a lady
She quiet as kept, I slap on her face and bite on her lips
My closet silk, the Maybach outside, and the floor is equipped
I don't recept', no receptionists, I don't accept
Tall, red shit, yeah, she inspire me
Woo, flavor, no freak, make a bitch shine my teeth
Teeth, we don't want peace, yeah, we're clearly young beasts
Oh, oh, oh, I gotta speed, baby, this a Lamborghini (Woah)
Woah, I don't need a seat, I'd rather run through the streets
Woo, hunnid K a week, livin' at the Grand Marquis
Woo, how much I can eat? I gotta see
Whoo, I gotta see, I was at the Grand Marquis
Divide the shooters (Divide)
Then split up the house
Intruder, the West Wing (Intruder)
They knockin' ya off (Blaow)
The AP a Mille, the baguette
It spilled, just look at the frost (Look at the 'guetty)
Pull all of my whips out
I make the North look a little awesome (Skrrt, skrrt)
The circle of bosses (Go)
Pussy, you better not cross us (Circle of bosses)
We asked your bitch (Yeah)
Her pussy be wetter than faucets (Ask, ask)
I close my fist (Close)
My ice, it make an announcement (Ice, ice)
I raise a brick (Brick)
Make her go hike on a mountain (Uh)4Embed
