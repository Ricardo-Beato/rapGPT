I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya

Gam-B, the one like Neo
You didn't see it coming: reverse Miss Cleo
I'm C-P30, or better yet, Anakin
When it comes to lightsabers that I'm handlin'
I used to be king of the whack look
Now I stay king of the MacBook
Yes, mack book, where you write your numbers down
Yeah, boy, I got girls in and out of town
You got it wrong like saying OJ "IJ"
Stop the rumors, Asian girls don't got sideways
I gotta fuck every shade of latte
I gotta flow like my mouth to Kanye's
These niggas think that I'm playing, I ain't saying nothing
I'll fuck your girl on the burner, I'm so top stuffing
You can't stop nothing, I'm the juggernaut
That's why your B's sweet on me like I'm butterscotch
Yeah, we run a lot, boy, the track runners here
I'm Elroy, we jet sun out the atmosphere
Let me make it clear, I'm your inner fear
And I'm taking over, please don't interfere
You might also like
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya

Uh, I'm the street's desire
You're getting too old, man, please retire
Don't make me carry you like I'm Liar Liar
Bring the heat like a monster, I'm Elmo's fire
I'm too busy spittin' shit with a socialite
I'm too busy sittin' bitch with some model types
Yes, sir, my girls look like Rihanna twice
With some packed bags, yeah, they ain't going home tonight
Get your camera phone, prove ya seen me
Or else you'll be with friends like "Please believe me!"
I'm all that, I'm Kel and Kenan
Nigga, I come hard like I'm filled with semen
These rappers bore me, gun talk with black clothes
Y'all let me know when y'all let 1998 go
Y'all niggas scared to grow, I'm never scared to go
Anywhere that's new, I go outside, y'all niggas stay at home
But that's alright dude, I'm a special guy
Y'all been wanting to rap since you were ankle high
And I've been wanting to rap since like, what, '05?
Do the math, man, how are you one of the best alive?
Gam-B, yes, me, best out there
Trying to get universal like healthcare
So fresh, so clean, like a new pair
When you get to the top, what you do there?
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya
I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya2Embed
