I don't care about your tattoos nigga
Got another nigga name tatto'd on you like you was a bitch
I can't do that nigga (I can't do that dog)
I'm too real, I fuck with realest niggas
How you gon get another nigga tattoo'd on your arm nigga?
What you Lil Wayne nigga? nigga ain't even got no car

I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off

I'm the type of guy, hit the studio smoking dro
And you the type of guy, in the O with none to smoke
Now I'm the type of guy, hit the club and I make it rain
And you the type of guy like, Cat buy me a chain
I'm the type of guy, hit park and drop my top
And you the type a guy, baby mamma at the bus stop
Now I'm the type a guy, swing on you soon as I see you
You got on them Dickies, I got on them Evisu's
I'm the type of guy, keep money cause I be hustling
Your the type of guy, I use to pay to tow my luggage
And you the type of guy, hit the mall but window shopping
Gucci can I be your hype man? hell nah you garbage

You the type of bitch. old as hell still trying to rap
And I'm the type of nigga, young as hell and I run the trap
Now your the type of freak, say lick your Georgia peach
You married to a lame, and that lame don't won't no beef
Now he the type of nigga that an old lame ass bitch would want
Ain't never drank no beer, ain't never rolled no blunt
Now she the type a girl, ain't got no ass on her back
No Kirk ain't got no money I heard she fucking cat
Now Jace the kinda guy go both ways think I don't know
I heard he fucking Kirk in ass on the D-Lo
Now Jace the kinda guy tell you, you gon make millions
But he's a pedophile, on the low he fucking children

I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off
Now you the type of guy, put a soldier rag on your stuff
But let a nigga black your eye, nigga at yo prom
Now you the type of guy rap about it but you don't live it
And I'm the type of guy catching charges bout to go to prison
You the type of guy in a five year old jersey
You say you got Grown Money but your ones so dirty
Now your the type I look at like my lil sister
A nigga black your eye and you, you had a pistol
You're the type guy always screamin' bout pimping
You claim you from Bankhead, but really yo ass from Griffin
You the type of guy who never gon be shit
Ain't never gave you three dollars, I know you'd suck Cat dick

I shook dem haters off, I shook dem haters off

These nigga shoes dirty as fuck dog
These niggas talk about they got pistols can't even buy bullets

It's like this, fact, I'm at the club, I'm performing
You wanna beef with me? the difference is, it's like I wanna beef with him but
Can you get Gucci Mane to get us through the door to beef with him
Cause we ain't got no money to get in
I mean I got like, 30 dollars, and Snead got no money
And I got 30 dollars cause I robbed sneaker man for 2 pair of air force ones
You bitch ass nigga, you's a broke nigga. with 100 dollar lick hitting ass nigga
If you wanna step up to the plate nigga and get you some real beef and beef with a real nigga
Nigga I'm in East Atlanta nigga, Moreland Avenue all day every day nigga
Riding around nigga, you'll see me in that yellow Vette, that candy red 74 Oldsmobile on 6s
Nigga my rims cost more than your whole life nigga, no money getting ass nigga
Nigga ain't never did a show, nigga ain't never got paid for a feature
Nigga you not really a rapper nigga, you like a nigga making demos nigga
You had one mixtape nigga that shit ain't did shit nigga
