29 ContributorsAmerican Way Lyrics{'Political'}
Newscaster: "Recently there has been an emergence of socially
Conscious and political rappers. It seems to be
A new trend in the Hip-Hop world."
*DJ scratches sample* {'Nas is a rebel to America!'}3X*
(Yeah, check it, uh)

Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard little longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice, I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MCs, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MCs on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody from the hood as my councilman, uh

Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit

Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
Israeli men conversatin' on ends
Probably businessmen, I sense good taste
And they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm tryna keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a black ho
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinsky or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most women who love Givenchy or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit

I don't care about the runaways, I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS, but I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think we're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane as long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates, they burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (Nas: Uh)

Can we make a change, you know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: Yeah)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way
