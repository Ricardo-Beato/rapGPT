Vert, I don't know what the fuck you're doing right now
But you better not be fucking no hoes to that dirty ass beat
Sorry
Vert, I need some dick right now
And my man ain't home, so come over
Nigga, and you better call me back
End of message, delete

I got all types of hoes, some of them love 'em
Most of them don't, some of them suck dick
Some of them won't
Some of them humble and some of them flaunt
And some of them skinny, but most of them thick
Got college bitch and she major in dick
Got me a bitch used to be a Crip and she still got the 40 on her hip
Got me a bitch that love to suck dick and it's kinda funny, she got a lisp
And I got me a bitch that love designer bitch
Love that Givenchy and love that Saks 5th
Got me a bitch, she with the shit
Mushrooms and acid she stay off a trip
Man, enough about these bitches
You might also like
Jewish bitch feed to me Latkes
After that spin her ass like a dreidel
I'm kickin' that shit just like soccer
And I'm plugged in like illegal cable
And if you is my main topper, then you all up on my table
My bitch look like Katara and she ride my dick like Opera
Fizzy murder, he a shotta and I wanna be like Silkk Da Shocker
And I made a lot of different of profits
Went from the noodles to the steak and the salads
And I'm so fly, I should be a stylist and I'm higher than a pilot
Now honest, Lil' Uzi, he the hottest
Nigga

I'm a man, what you sayin', you's a fan
Caught you dead on a frame, you's a lame
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz
40K on a frame, you's a lame
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz
What you sayin', what you sayin'?
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz

I got bands, I got bands
Taking trips 'cause I can
To motherland, to Japan
Miami, my hoe she getting too tan
Well damn, platinum in mouth and hand
Whippin' that shit out the pan
Fillet Mignon, eating on lamb
Damn, this shit wasn't in the plan
Chain on my neck weigh kilogram
MCM scarf, the color of sand
Pink bathing apes, feel like Killer Cam
You flexin' on cam', you probably get jammed, damn
I'm a man, what you sayin'? You's a fan
Caught you dead on a frame, you's a lame
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz
40K on a frame, you's a lame, I got bandz
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz
What you sayin'?4Embed
