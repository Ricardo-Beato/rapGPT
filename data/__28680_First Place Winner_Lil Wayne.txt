Am I the best? Yes
Am I the best? Yes
I'm a first place winner, first place winner
I'm a first place winner, first place winner
I ain't never been scared to get-get-get no get no money
I ain't never been scared to g-g-get no get no money
I ain't never been scared to get-get-get no get no money
I ain't never been scared to get no money money money...

Hahaha, Young Money baby!
Ay! Just because I just said Young Money
I just made this song a whole lot better
Doesn't money make everything better?
Fuck it, yeah Young Money, Cash Money
Young Money, Cash Money, Young Money, Cash.. Money..
Big money, beyotch!! hehe
I know they tired of me
Cause I'm sleeping on them
I ain't never been scared of getting no money bitch!
,
What the fuck I look like?
Fuck my verse nigga Swizz got the hook right
Don't look left baby girl just look right
And you gon' see us in more red than Suge Knight
Gangbanger yes, soo-woo gang
And if you ain't wit it then you in the food chain,,
I'm in that wide body I'ma need two lanes
Blue seats, white paint wetter than new rain
It look like a white person, with blue veins
I keep a black Glock, red dot, blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
'Cause all my kicks fly, like Liu Kang
Hehehe, old player new game
I'm focused, I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime, I feel like a new Wayne
How come there is two bitches but ain't no two Waynes?
{*Wayne over Hook*}
Hehe I don't know what they do but I do thangs
It's Mr. Everytime You See Me Got A New Chain
My flow crazy, I ain't too sane
But I am the shit and they just poop stains
{*Wayne talking*}
Haha
Yeah!
Now all the ladies say, "ooh Wayne, ooh Wayne"
Hehe, alright
YEAH! AY!

Playing Tony Hawk on the Xbox, burnin incense
Rocking sweat pants and some Jordan number sixes

Get the champagne from the top shelf
The crib got wings like a jet, one east one west

And I'm comfortable like my sheet satin

And I never been to culinary school but cook work (cheah)

And I hustle for my +Bills+ like I'm from Buffalo
Ya figga deal - but on the really-real
Pause the clock my flow timeless
Say my name and lose your job like you're Don Imus (fuck you)
