5 ContributorsCome as You Are Lyrics
I know, they mighta told you
That you had to trust like this and pray like that
You might feel that all you done, that's going too far (Going too far)
I just want you to know, that God's not tripping on your clothes
He is more concerned about your soul and your heart
We  We both got saved
I don't have a Heaven or Hell, to get you in my friend
(He loves us all) Yes, he does (He love me, He)
So give him your heart, it's a very good start
And come as you are
No matter if you're from the street
Repent your sense of honestly
Just come as you are (Come as you are)
Don't have to drive a fancy car, or dress like your a movie star
Just come as you are (Come as you are)
Over here, you have a voice
Rejoice and make a joyful noise
Come as you are (Come as you are)
Give him all the glory, we can live and tell the story
Come on, come as you are (Come as you are)
Wherever you comin' from, *let's lift our hands as one*
And praise the Lord together
He'll tell us well done, we're all his daughters and sons
Let's make the world much better
Just come as you are
You might also like
I know, you told him you was leavin'
I know, They called you a Heathen
I know, and nobody said wait child don't go
I know, you know what to believe in
I know, cuz the preacher ain't reaching
I know, and the teacher ain't teaching
I know, yeah (you know)
I know, that when you wake up
You know, that it's not your own air that your breathing
You know, when you think it over, that's he's brought ya over
So it don't matter what people say, just come on
No matter if you're from the street
Repent your sense of honesty (Repent and be honest)
Just come as you are (Come as you are)
(Come as you are) (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't have to drive a fancy car (no no), or dress like your a movie star (hey)
Just come as you are (Come as you are) (yeah) (Come as you are) (Oh) Over here, you have a voice (come on it's your voice)
Rejoice and make a joyful noise (A)
Come as you are (Come as you are) (Come as you are)
Give him all the glory, (yeah) we can live and tell the story (yes ah ah)
Come on, come as you are (Come as you are) (Come as you are)
Wherever you comin' from, *let's lift our hands as one*
And praise the Lord together
He'll tell us well done, we're all his daughters and sons
Let's make the world much better
Just come as you are
Everyone's welcome to come

That's why we sing dis' song
You could be the one, if you want to come
Everybody's welcome to come (oh yea)
There's room for everyone (Yes it is)
