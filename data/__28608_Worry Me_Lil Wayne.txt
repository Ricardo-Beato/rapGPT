You gotta walk like a (soldier)
Talk like a (stunna)
Move like a (player)
And get it like a (hustler)
You gotta walk like a (soldier)
Talk like a (stunna)
Move like a (player)
And get it like a (hustler)
Because I won't let y'all worry me
I got something chrome that I carry with me
It's Young Weezy Wee y'all ain't scaring me
I'm the seventeen don till they bury me

Eh, it go whoa oh me oh my ay ay
I'm H-O-T-B-O-Y ay ay
I'm so fly I'm the Birdman Jr
Stunting in the grayar
Shordy play your playar
Slick clean A.R
Fifteen ridin' with me sprayar
You don't want no drama with me play boy
Keep low or it's murda she wrote, pussy nigga
I gotta keep it cookin' cause the streets still hot boy shooken
Plus my late pop's still lookin'
Bust my tray quick if ya hate the pimp
Think it's all big fish I don ate the shrimp
Roll out wit the hood cause I'm so damn street
I rep Hollygrove and Hollygrove rep me
And that's how Weezy Wee be
And y'all gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me

Ridin' and I'm dolo on my way to the stizzo
Knowin' on my waist is the sizzo
Weezy so hot Glock ten and a pistol
Big rims with the tires thin as a pencil
Mami want me cause I got pimpin' potential
I stick to my mental
Don't make me stick my fifth to your temple
Forget I'm gettin' rich for a cent
Bitch I'm comin' get you for my baby mama's rent I will flip you
90 on the highway seein' what the whip do
Cops get behind me they wan' see the whip too
S-Q professor C-M-B alumni
Everybody else fails except the young guy
Don't worry bout Weezy for real nigga I done mine
Got the biggest nuts up in here nigga I swung mine
Streets taught me never to fear nigga I run mine
I can't lose cause I one mine
Now one yourself
You gotta walk like a (soldier)
Talk like a (stunna)
Move like a (player)
And get it like a (hustler)
You gotta walk like a (soldier)
Talk like a (stunna)
Move like a (player)
And get it like a (hustler)
Because I won't let y'all worry me
I got something chrome that I carry with me
It's Young Weezy Wee y'all ain't scaring me
I'm the seventeen don till they bury me

I got five drinks swimmin' in me
Four chunks of dro up in my lung pipe
Three guns
Two bitches
And all I need is one night
And I bet you gon' like
C'mon we only get one life
And if it's done right
B, your nigga might wife her
You know S-Q galore low top three striper
I'm just tryna keep paper
Please, don't be a hater cause he'll take ya Weez
Gon' be a major cause he greater
Cheese gon' feed Nate
Whether it's keys or emceeing, I'ma see a way
Cause I can move yay
Like you never thought hard or soft like a duck
And you don' wan' start me
That shit could be bad for your heartbeat
Cash'll get you snatched in a heartbeat
Mash in a mad dash in a Cadillac wit the alligator dashboard
Damn whore
Yeah I know
You gotta walk like a (soldier)
Talk like a (stunna)
Move like a (player)
And get it like a (hustler)
You gotta walk like a (soldier)
Talk like a (stunna)
Move like a (player)
And get it like a (hustler)
Because I won't let y'all worry me
I got something chrome that I carry with me
It's Young Weezy Wee y'all ain't scaring me
I'm the seventeen don till they bury me

You gotta walk like a alright
