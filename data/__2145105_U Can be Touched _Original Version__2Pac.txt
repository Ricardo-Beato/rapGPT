14 ContributorsU Can be Touched (Original Version) Lyrics
You can be touched
You can be touched
You can be touched

Oh God, forgive me, mother, please say a prayer for me
Needed a father, but he was never there for me
Believin' everything they feed me, I'm seein' demons
I wake up screamin', who'd believe me or was I dreamin'?
Five fingers on the 45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, want to see what's after this
I'm livin' blind writin' rhymes 'til they capture this
If I die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes, hate to see a black man cry
They picture me inside a casket that's how they see us
Oh God, forgive us ghetto bastards, we human beings
Seein' us inside this hell-hole
Just waitin' to fail, so they tell us that's what jail is for
Adolescent young dream's turned violent
Explodin' in a world turned silent
'Cause you could be touched

My young niggas in the wild life
(You can be touched)
Criminal mind of a juvenile still livin' a child life
(You can be touched)
Thinkin' he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
(You can be touched)
'Cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile livin' a child life
(You can be touched)
Thinkin' he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
'Cause you can be touched
You might also like
Imagine us up in this game, you's a veteran
Bouncin' up in yo' plush spot watchin' David Letterman
Chillin', clearly made it and it's clearly stated
By that thirty yard pool, the five cars, the women and the jewels
Richness, oozing out your balls
But only you and God knows the evil you did to get yours
Crossed ever nigga that ever trusted you
Just a scared nigga, afraid one day they might bust at you
Look at you done came so far but did to much
And got to a point in the game where ya ass is stuck
Touched you because the Don gave the word too
He was going unprepared and got laced on and got murdered

Now I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggas that ever breathed
Initiated as an Outlaw back in '94
Snuck in the jaw and ever since I wanted more
Older niggas givin' me the game, nobody has touch me
On everybody's game, I put my cards on the table
And look through them carefully patiently
While everybody's racin', stay aware 'cause everyday there's another nigga dead
And this should tell you somethin'
Knowin' everybody dies (Yeah), sometimes it's just for nothin'
I know that I could be got but should they shoot me, I'm shot
Touched me, trust me, my nuts mean a lot
You can be touched
My young niggas in the wild life
(You can be touched)
Criminal mind of a juvenile still livin' a child life
(You can be touched)
Thinkin' he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
(You can be touched)
'Cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still livin' a child life
(You can be touched)
Thinkin' he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggas better slow down
'Cause you can be touched

How you gonna live a life you can't see it in front of you?
I know and still know shorty hard, I'm one of you
Thinkin' that it just can't happen this quick
'Cause you run in the town and put that shit on a brick
Now don't nobody know you but the cops and robbers
Leavin' school with problems, tryna blame it on our father
But his place that you livin' in shit
Straight knowin' that's the place you gonna die
Probably why you ain't givin' a shit
While addicted, livin' my life lost and wicked
Nigga forget it
'Cause all that clownin' won't prevent this gat from blowin'
Me and my Outlawz we roam
Should have thought before you crossed now my big homies knowin'
And that's the wrongest of wrong, with the strength of the strong
Fuck around with Napo' should have moved out ya' home
'Cause nigga I'm knowin' who you fuckin' where you goin'
And the way you make your money, now your weakness is showin'
Brother drowned in this world give a damn who she loved
That her father won't be here long enough to see how ya' grown
He got touched

God made the world in seven days
How in the hell can niggas be so amazin'
Situations that muthafuckas have to face
For instance, the government admitted it. (MLK)
You can be touched
You can be touched2Embed
