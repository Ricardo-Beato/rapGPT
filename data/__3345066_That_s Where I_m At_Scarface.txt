2 ContributorsThat’s Where I’m At Lyrics
When people look at me, I know it's plain to see
That I am not the problem, yet they blaming me
It's bad enough the homies wanna squeeze my blood
But I gotta watch these cops 'cause they've been killing us
I see it in the news, on every other day
Another brother dead but they look the other way
Or blame on the time that he spent
Locked down for a crime he ain't commit — was innocent
Can't wait to lock you up and throw away the key
Or kill you like a dog off in these fuckin' streets
I wonder why they fearing our black planet
But I'm still standing here 'cause I am that planted
Rooted in these motherfuckin' streets
You may have scared my mom but you ain't scaring me
We the people stand as one, white or black
Or Mexican-American, that's fact, just where I'm at

This revolution got something going on
You think it's bullshit; we know it's full grown, yeah, yeah

I don't expect protection from Jeff Sessions
The Klan is still alive using that very weapon
We like the Constitution you was using
Stop making up excuses, I am only human
A Black man way better than
Any racist motherfucker out there think he better than
Me, 'cause I got knowledge of myself
I'm just trying to teach that knowledge to somebody else
Yeah, they got a target on our babies
That's been heavy on my mind as of lately
It's crazy, you send your kids off to college
And then you get that phone call that's telling you somebody shot him
Wow, it's life or death right now
Just trying to catch my breath right now
Every time I leave the house I'm strapped
I tried to walk away but I'm back, that's just where I'm at
You might also like
This revolution got something going on
You think it's bullshit; we know it's full grown, yeah, yeah

It's do or die for you and I
'Cause only you and I can do for you and I
Change your focal, vote local
It's deeper than just words, this is soul food
What's so great about a place that wants to separate
And build a wall? If that's the case, then we were never safe
I wonder where was Donald when Obama
Gave the knot to get Usama
Deeper than the apprentice, where people got a lifetime sentence
Hated because the color of their skin never blemish
Or blend in—calling me 'colored,' I'm offended
The DACA policy is ended, this place will never grow
That whole administration needs to go
I'm just here to speak the shit you need to know
Old man starting wars on Twitter
White man, why are y'all so bitter...toward niggas?Embed
