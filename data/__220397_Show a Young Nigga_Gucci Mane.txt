Gas, gas, gas gas gas
Well don't smoke
Gucci do

Show a little young nigga something, I could show a little young nigga something
Show a little young nigga something, I could show a little young nigga something
I can front an ya'll nigga, got 100 young niggas
That's 100 young niggas getting money
Rather hang with my young niggas, OG's ain't 100

Jackpot, trap spot, crack rock, duece pot
Too hot, 2Pac, rob you with your own Glock
New watch, blue drop with no top, I'm so hot
All my shows sold out, my bitch got her toes out
Ten stripper, seven out of ten got so ass shots
A nigga got her locked, I need to send a bitch a green dot
She feeling like a codeine fiend when the lean out
I'm a lean junkie, pint buyer bring that clean out
I got big old diamond rings, man they look just like wedding rings
Hold another up, you's a runner-up trap king
A bird brain nigga go for anything, anything
Air heads, butterfly, ice cream, ice cream
But you can't throw piss on me, say it's lemonade
And you ain't fooling me, I know that chain fugazy
I'm being honest, you suck on me it's your lucky day
I'm sucka free, don't need no suckas round me anyway
It's Guwop

My mother sold dope, grandma yay
My favorite uncle Goat and he still smoke yay
I sold my uncle Goat a dub on his check day
I know it's wrong, I pun his ID like the next J
I'm smoking weed, I'm tryna' forget a couple court dates
Gorilla out of jail turned into a cupcake
Put a word out, a nigga get his cake baked
I told my niggas run a G on yo' auntie
Gucci got a lot of G's on me VVV
It's 2013, I'm still so icy
I heard Tip and Jeezy say that they don't like me
Red bottom Gucci nigga do it just like Nike
BUR!


Everything glitter ain't gold, like Ace Hood's Rolly is
It's not a diss but take my Gucci clothes off and I'm Gucci still
I can't stop hustling still my mom live where Oprah live
I used to drive by and wish I live like Holyfield
And fuck Dr. Phil, is he bringing up the Double Seal
They say I'm bipolar, but my diamonds they sholl is
Your favorite rapper pussy and his shooter's bisexual
If you can't count I'm nearly 100, don't say you on my level bro
They call me trap god, I'm a man of god
I was still a trap god at the Traveler's lodge
At the Golf Knights Inn, or the  Econolodge
I cut my diamonds like jumbo Now & laters, dope so hard
