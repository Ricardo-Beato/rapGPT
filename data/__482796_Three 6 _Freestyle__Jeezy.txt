5 ContributorsThree 6 (Freestyle) LyricsI say T-R-A-P-O-R-DIE, Nigga
U-S-D-A, Move, Sell, Buy Yay
I say what I mean, mean what I say
Bitch four niggas on ya like the "Lean Back" remix
And you dont know me like that, like Chris Lova
I used to sell brick house like them two brothers (YEEEEAH!)
But not the kind you live in
But the kind you sell so you can buy a crib to live in
Mac eleven clips long like night sticks
And thats Jeezy with a j get it right bitch
Slow your roll or pump your brakes
Put the barrel in your mouth nigga pump your face
And thats all for some shit you said over a beat
Put your motherfuckin thoughts on your passenger seat
