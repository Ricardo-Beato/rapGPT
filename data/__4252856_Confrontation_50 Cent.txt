2 ContributorsConfrontation Lyrics
I'm in love with confrontation
Nigga, fuck around I cuss something
Pull out and buck something
I’m addicted to the altercation
Go ahead, nigga try me
You get hooked to a IV
It's just me and my nine
Like all the time
We built for the drama
Me and my llama

Ayo, look
You can't handle my gun handle
I’m like Kobe with the outside shots
I'm like Artest in the paint
When it comes to these games
Set the balls a lot smaller and they go through brains
And if they live you get one point
But if you hit 'em in the head you get three
Whether they make it or not, a headshot 's a headshot, nigga
That is unless you did it by mistake

"Man, this 50 fucking grimey, got my spot shot up
I think he tryna line me 'cause I want to take his product "
Nigga, fuck with me, you push up daisies
Straight crazy, that's how the Southside made me
So Brenda's baby, I'm a army brat for real
Niggas tell me chill, now how the fuck am I supposed to chill?
When the voices in my head telling me "kill, kill, kill"
I cock it, aim it, and sqeeuze the steel steel

I’m in love with confrontation
Nigga, fuck around I cuss something
Pull out and buck something
I’m addicted to the altercation
Go ahead, nigga try me
You get hooked to a IV
It's just me and my nine
Like all the time
We built for the drama
Me and my llama

I got a lot of brilliant ideas on how to bring tears to your peers
So controll all your swears and life stares
Yeah, my chain hang low, but I bet they won’t touch it though
Got the audio on me, homie, that'll stop a buffalo
Jump into a puddle, went inside my 7 double 0
Make a detour to the 
They don't want the trouble so talking don't bother me
A simple robbery could turn to strong arm robbery

In the middle of all your projects, I show up and show out
Maybach ’62, chaffeur the bowed out
Brazilian fold out, my bitch
Her ass so fat her pussy come out like a fish
We gorillas in the mist
Boy, we aim, you done, nigga
The U22 like a alien gun
Give the new aliens new names and run
Homocide come around, fade to black on them
I'm in love with confrontation
Nigga, fuck around I cuss something
Pull out and buck something
I'm addicted to the altercation
Go ahead, nigga try me
You get hooked to a IV
It's just me and my nine
Like all the time
We built for the drama
Me and my llamaEmbed
