3 ContributorsThang on Me Lyrics

Now what ya'll haters wan' do?
It's like a red carpet every time I come through
 and the bag with the mean Prada shoe
These chickens lookin' sick, guess they got the bird flu
'Cause I'm the first lady and my niggas ride with me
The crew get fresh, flow slick like Ricky
Even on my off day, yeah the girl get busy
A lot of chicks try but they can't fuck with me, Kimmy
You can find me in the club
Bottles ain't the only thing poppin' in the club
If them haters start frontin' then we gotta turn it up
And you alrеady know BK gon' light it up
 and don't disrespect her
Pussy young gal don't dеal with no amatuer
It's Queen Bee and Gang Star in your area
Team gon' (Pow! Pow!)
Rewind selector (Rewind selector)
Pow! Pow!You might also likeEmbed
