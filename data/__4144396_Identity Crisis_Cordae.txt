6 ContributorsIdentity Crisis Lyrics
This, this for the real

Now let me try to reconsider, before I start to address
Would I be searching for the answers, that's a part of this test
But that's life, it's a given, now I'm harder to stress
And in my mind, I'm in prison, in my heart, I'm just blessed
Don't respond to whack rappers, I just target the best
I switched out and stayed true, you just marketing less
Can't you fathom when you down and you dark and depressed
This for them folks who like drowning with the sharks and the pets
I'm just a regular nigga
Searching different ways to better my figures
Forever, they bitter
I know it, and I never will give up
Clever endeavors, I treasure, on my dresser is scriptures
What this mean, it's protection, know Baretta is thinking
Cuz I need it, the streets leave you speechless
Our demons, and niggas schemin', no room for a thesis
Life's a struggle that have you puzzled, I'm searching for pieces
I'm planning for better days, where house on the beaches

Let me tell you about the good
Let me tell you bout the bad
Let me tell you how it should
But it never gonna last
Cuz I'm thinking greatness that we gon' be
My pastor say it, it's all on me
Let me tell you about the good
Let me tell you bout the bad
Let me tell you how it should
But it never gonna last
Cuz I'm thinking greatness that we gon' be
My pastor say it, it's all on me
You might also like
Now I don't know what your incentive is
Or any time of benefit
You think you gon' get out but I can vouch, can see the differences
Of real and fake, and I can feel the hate
But I don't cry or wonder why, I just fill my plate
Cuz we tryna eat, always grinding but honestly
We can't afford to sleep, until my bed got designer sheets
Different mindset cuz climates bringing all kind of heat
And everybody quiet, no denying, I gotta speak

Let me tell you about the good
Let me tell you bout the bad
Let me tell you how it should
But it never gonna last
Cuz I'm thinking greatness that we gon' be
My pastor say it, it's all on me
Let me tell you about the good
Let me tell you bout the bad
Let me tell you how it should
But it never gonna last
Cuz I'm thinking greatness that we gon' be
My pastor say it, it's all on me

This whole year I learned one thing, that life's a killer
To survive through the jungles, had to fight gorillas
And I don't really do collabs cuz I'm twice as iller
So no exchange go around, no Bryson Tiller
Next out the DMV and not the license dealer
And now the pressure's on me, sounds quite familiar
But I'm up for the task cuz my mic is realer
Ironically, your girl left cuz she like a thriller
And I see they so scared cuz I'm getting better
I be speaking to them folks with my written letters
Man I want it bad now, want this shit forever
And every line like damn, man this nigga clever
I'm bragging different, but minimizing is half official
Cuz I believe in unity and that's what rap is missing
My swag terrific, so effortless, pull the baddest bitches
Time to paint a new story cuz my last was vivid1Embed
