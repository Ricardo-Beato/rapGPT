14 ContributorsMillions Lyrics
From the bottom up
I’m thinking millions
From nothing to something
I’m thinking millions
From a dollar
I’m thinking millions
To a hundred million
We showed you how its done
I’m thinking millions
x2
A million dollars cash
A million dollars cash
A million dollars cash
I’m thinking millions

See a black exotic off in traffic then you know its me
See me in the club a few times and I think you know a g
They say young can you read card , tell them “totally”
Let them rappers do that rap shit this I poetry
Polo T all black welcome to the after life
Money is the root of all evil meet the antichrist
Jackson tripping on each other they shot West Side little brother
At the ER with his mother I'm drunker than a motherfucker
Cried a few Belvedere tears like a fucking boss
Real nigga good kid yeah we took a fucking loss
Yeah I seen your type nigga yeah I know your new with it
Yeah you want a million dollars what you gon do with it

Hustle all day everyday yeah I know the law
They say young only do it for the real I tell them show your rough
Ye stay talking real shit put on a show tonight
Got that real thug motivation real talk flow tonight
Got my first 28 put it in my blue jeans
Only thing I can envision nigga is them new things
New coupe new crib new chain new watch
So its all eyes on me nigga 2Pac
Red plastic cup and it got that true syrup in it
Vodka got a nigga wanna tell the truth for a minute
Got a few times nigga now let me see you get it
Your first million dollars nigga what you go do with it
