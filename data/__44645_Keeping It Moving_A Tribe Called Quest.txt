48 ContributorsKeeping It Moving Lyrics
Somethin' for your earhole, so you can clean them shits out
It seems that some don't understand what I'm talkin' about
How you get West Coast nigga, from West Coast hater?
I could never diss a whole coast, my time is too greater (True)
Yeah, we from the East, the land of originators
You also from the West, the land of innovators
The only difference of the two is the style of the rap
Plus the musical track, this beef shit is so wack
Let me let y'all brothers know I ain't no West Coast disser
Another thing I'm not, is a damn ass kisser
So listen to my words as I set things straight
I ain't got no beef, so don't come in my face!

Yo, keep it movin' — yeah, to the K.I.M
Keep it movin' — yeah, yeah, to the K.I.M
I ain't got no time for schuckin' and jivin', uh
Keep it movin', keep it movin' — yeah, yeah, to the K.I.M
Keep it movin' — yeah, yeah, to the K.I.M
I ain't got no time for schuckin' and jivin'

Hip-hop — a way of life
It doesn't tell you how to raise a child or treat a wife
I verbalize over.. rhyme friendly
That puts a listener in a frenzy, so pop me in your Benzi
You dig it? Get wit' it, or get your melon splitted
If you ever try to combat, Sirat al-Mustaqim
We got the illy team that doesn't even sweat the gleam
Or glamour, we'll Figure-4 your ass like Greg the Hammer
Man, we rockin' joints like The Who or Santana
Keepin' jams packed and hotter than Havana
Positivity is the key in the lock
Put your hand on it, turn it to the right, Akh
We doin' daredevil dandies on these mics
Peace out to the whole Hiero who's puffin' on the hydro
Yeah, dun, we movin' how we like
Since the days of rockin' hi-lows, we keepin' things on pyro
Fire! As we move with zeal and desire
Now the hip-hop plan, hope you compiler
Son, we havin' tunnel vision, but my sight is real, real broad
'Cause I can't afford to miss that call
Makin' moves, not movies, as we get on the ball
And we keepin' things covered like a female shawl
When I watch hockey, yo, I just look for the brawl
Quest-Quest, and you know we signin' out, y'all
You might also like
Keep it movin' — yeah, yeah, to the K.I.M
Keep it movin' — yeah yeah to the K.I.M
I ain't got no time for schuckin' and jivin', uh
Keep it movin' — yeah, yeah
Keep it movin' — yeah, yeah, to the K.I.M
Keep it movin' — true dat, to the K.I.M
I ain't got no time for schuckin' and jivin', uh
