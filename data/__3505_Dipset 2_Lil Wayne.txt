27 ContributorsDipset 2 Lyrics
Hahaha
Kush
Good kush, yup

Weezy, dip-dip, Wayne set set
And I grip Tecs, leave 'em waterbed wet
And I know just where to put these hollow tips:
His chest, his chest, his chest, ha

Yeah

Ayo, I take on a gang of gangs, anything, animal, orangutans
Gorillas turn to Bathing Apes when I make it rain
I got a whole collection, I got a dope connection
I got a coke connection, I got a dough infection
No homo, my flow is as hard as an erection
So that's why it's "fuck the world with protection"
Haha, pay attention to the lecture
My words carry life, like a stretcher
Yeah, you know young Wayne in here
Smellin' teen spirit, like Kurt Cobain was here
Yeah, yeah, we got them things in here
And we will bang in here—yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the bank is here, Lincolns here, Grantses here
Jacksons here, Franklins here, them dead motherfuckers
And the drank is here, dank is here, stank in here
Gangstas here, wankstas fear that red motherfucker
And my city hot, ride with the itchy cock
Coupe with the titties pop, motherfuck a city cop
And I got the haters like, "When will he stop?"
Maybe a minute after never—set your clocks
I'm a nutcase, Uptown's my birthplace
They feel me coming, like the weekend on Thursday
You might also like
We got Vegas chips, nigga, bet, bet
I hope you boys ready, because I'm jet-set
And when I come up in the building, you already know:
Bitch wet, bitch wet, bitch wet—fuck now!
Hahaha

Yeah!
Yes, um

Gloves, draws, socks, tees
All made by Ralph Lauren
No shades, just my eyeballs watching them
Tattoos on top of them
Igloos for watches and champagne for breakfast
And sports cars for lunch and pussy for dinner
I eat rappers and call it "pussy for dinner," yeah
Ask the paparazzi, I'm in the Maserati
Ridin' shotty, bad bitch: Clyde and Bonnie
I call her Kami—that's short for "kamikaze"
She call me Daddy, and never short with Daddy money
It's Weezy Baby, shine like a brass monkey
I'm never broke, never have a cast on me
Always paid, always got cash on me
I gotta feed, the pockets of my pants hungry
I'm a Phantom hauler; a shooter, not a brawler
And your girlfriend's a determined Carter caller
Control a bitch and let a nigga hold a bitch
I put her on the corner, shit, I let her make a porno flick
She will play the role again whenever she roll again
Pop a pill and roll again, now we on the road again
Yeah, yeah I work her, work her
Tell her be my slave, bitch I'm paid
Out my cage, I just can't feel my face
With Santana, we wild riders, like Al Qaeda
Supreme Dada, Young Moolah, Bird Junior
Yeah
