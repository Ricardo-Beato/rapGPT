6 ContributorsNun â€™bout U Lyrics
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
Wearing Gucci for the rest of my life
They don't want to
I don't know nun 'bout you
Four hoes laid up at the hotel right now
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
Couple traps old school with the coupe with the shoes
Nigga I don't know nun 'bout you
Got a crew full of goons and they all gonna shoot
Nigga I don't know nun 'bout you

Achu achu achu you sniff this cash here do that too
My bitch at immigration right now
Man I hope they let her come through (she foreign)
Pull up too hung on dat whip (skirt skirt)
The coupe no roof you know I'm koo
Let the AC blow
Got a blow like boss and George and Diego
I'm double cup
On molly
I'm arrogant and cocky
My bankroll is come stop me
Put icing on my watches
I'm swagged up in Versace
They got my swag on copy
I had to change the topic
I see them haters watching
He never had no fame
He never sold them thangs
Who the hell are you (who the fuck are you)
Anybody can make it rain
Four hundred dollars on some frames (designer)
Me and you don't see the same (we ain't never did)
What set you claim (what set you claim)
Y'all niggas don't sell cocaine
You might also like
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
Wearing Gucci for the rest of my life
They don't want to
I don't know nun 'bout you
Four hoes laid up at the hotel right now
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
Couple traps old school with the coupe with the shoes
Nigga I don't know nun 'bout you
Got a crew full of goons and they all gonna shoot
Nigga I don't know nun 'bout you

Me and Gucci going crazy with the band
Me and G been in this bitch two hours
Free Band we international
You know the world is ours
The clothing line is crazy
The clientele is amazing
Got a multimillion-dollar deal on the table
Ain't no way we waiting
Free Band gang 'round the nation
Too real no way we hating
Ford Pinto laid up in Vegas
I can buy me a new Mercedes
Right now I feel like racing (skirt skirt)
Put a old school Lamberts in a station
Ride presidential Rolly
My bezels gone skating
There's ice on my wrists
I kill you long distance
I'm plugged in with migo
They coming with fishes
They say you bought ten of them
Nobody help witness
They cash out on chickens
They cash out on chickens
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
Wearing Gucci for the rest of my life
They don't want to
I don't know nun 'bout you
Four hoes laid up at the hotel right now
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
Couple traps old school with the coupe with the shoes
Nigga I don't know nun 'bout you
Got a crew full of goons and they all gonna shoot
Nigga I don't know nun 'bout you

Ok I wake up in the morning
With a bitch I don't even know
And it's Sunday morning
In church I don't even go
Trap with that Young Jeezy flow
Time to let the people know
I can count the time
We done hit the convient store
Real shit I had to let that true religion and Jeezy go
I've seen too many people in it
I ain't saying leave the store
I'm a leader though
Follow me on Twitter ho
Y'all are talking bricks
But bitch we just got rid of four
Shit get critical
Even get a little physical
Don't care none about no bitch
Bitch I feel like Mystikal
Survive through the difficult
I've been with them different folks
Ain't even made it yet
What the fuck they hating on Cooley for
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
Wearing Gucci for the rest of my life
They don't want to
I don't know nun 'bout you
Four hoes laid up at the hotel right now
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
I don't know nun 'bout you
Couple traps old school with the coupe with the shoes
Nigga I don't know nun 'bout you
Got a crew full of goons and they all gonna shoot
Nigga I don't know nun 'bout you1Embed
