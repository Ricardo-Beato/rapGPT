5 ContributorsA Boy Was Conceived (Intro) Lyrics
Only three short years after the 1965 Watts Riots
And the death of Malcolm X
And of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr
A boy was conceived
Whose lyrics would change the world

Cube, please stop rapping so we can come out and get some, some more of this action man. You know when we ain't doin' no movies I'm back out here selling half ounces and quarters of that good weed in the neighborhoodYou might also likeEmbed
