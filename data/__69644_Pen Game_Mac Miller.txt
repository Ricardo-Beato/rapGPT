13 ContributorsPen Game Lyrics
Yo, P.A. to B.K
Skyzoo, Easy Mac, Pittsburgh to NYC
I love money, I love money (Yeah)
 you take a buck from me, you Doug Funnie (Y'all know what it is)
I said I love money, I love money (Listen, check it, one-two)
You take a buck from me, better duck, dummy (Yo) (What up, Mac?)

With my man Skyzoo (Yo,) it's the class clown of his high school
Drown you in typhoons, hittin' you with rhyme too (What's good?)
These haters keep they eyes glued, pound if you my dude (Yo, what up?)
We stay high like Einstein's IQ
And y'all ma'fuckers know where I'm comin from'
Chewin' cats up, like a lil' piece of bubblegum (Bubblegum)
Tryin' double sum's, hustle, wanna let my money run
I ain't even battlin' dude, I'm having fun with 'im (Haha)
Jokes make him feel wrong in his own skin
Sippin' gin from a bin that's makin' my dome spin (Dome spin)
And you the type to try and take from your own kin
Feel it close on your toes, hangin' by clothes pins
I'm spittin blades, Goddamn it, my tooth hurts
A mouth filled with a bunch of cancerous tumors
Yup, music's my baby, I ain't gon' lose her
So I stay with a radio, like Cuba Gooding Junior (You know)

"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"

I'm one drink away from everything you meant to say
Like I think he on the rise to what the kings made
And in the blink of an eye I'm on the king's page
But no album, this is all off of the mixtapes, and
In a different lane, no signs of road rage
'Cause ain't nobody over here to rage wit', there's no gains
No sleep, no retreat, no surrender
No apologies from me, I'm the penner of the penners
I mean what I speak, so if I givin' you a sentence
Then it be's what it be's, nothing hid on the agenda
You leave it up to me, and you can divy up your team
Put your pride in the air and I'm dismembering your members
The heart of the city, the startin' point guard
That can play up to the fall, so the parts is all gone
No room on the bench and I got a no trade clause
So I'm here, long haul, no switchin'
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"

Yo, look, yo
I rip mics to pieces, cook 'em or eat 'em raw (Raw)
Was bustin' freestyles before I could read at all (Haha)
MCs just call me the monster in their mind
That'll haunt 'em all the time and they thought that if they rhyme
They could make the situation lil' different then the present (What?)
See, I fucked this track, worried that I got it pregnant
I'm haulin' ass, y'all is whack, taking out the garbage, trash
Duckin' from these sharks and crabs, givin' MCs heart attacks
It's your boy Mac, damn, I'm great
And you gets no love like a man with AIDS
I fill you dancin' gays with some hand grenades
Drop bombs, remove your hands and legs
And I pray; dear Lord please give me the strength
Not put these little snakes in the tank 'til they faint
Suffocating, now you choke, you a broke MC
And there ain't nothing left to do but just smoke up your weed like...
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"Embed
