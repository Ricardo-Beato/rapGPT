26 ContributorsDemonology Lyrics
I see 'em, I see 'em
You don't see 'em?
For real?
Look around, son
Look around, son

Take a trip, I got you floating on this real spit
I rock the boat so much you get nauseous and start to feel sick
Too many house niggas, I'm taking 'em on a field trip
Your fate is sealed: a life that come with a kill-switch
My wife said I've got demons I've yet to deal with
But I ain't trying to hear her though, my music is my mirror though
They like to put me on a pedestal for conscious rap
My flesh is edible, it's hard to keep the monsters back
The polar opposite of too emotional
Got feelings and emotions, just hoping I don't overdose
And miss the moments trying to control 'em til I'm on overload
Or hard to handle, we get dismantled and now I'm home alone
I power trip like I'm sampling Hubert Laws no more
I got honor, face my karma like a Buddhist law
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?

Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you
You might also like
Demons want a pound of my flesh, it's quite accurate
It's tragic when you feel like your lawyer the devil advocate
Legal-ese ain't a language, they made it up
No wonder I'm losing blood, everybody taking a cut
Speaking in tongues, they depleting your funds, beating the drums
Of war to fry lines to your fortunate sons
You think boys point guns when they run to the sun?
A decoy, Pink Floyd, cause they're comfortably numb
Word, wrapping ourselves in denial like it's a warm blanket
Trying to go native like faces that get war painted
Pac shot in Las Vegas of all places
Fighting dark sides of the Force like he was Lord Vader
Y'all haters develop and lead the role
When they start to give 'em parts of your life and feed the trolls
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?

Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you
This feel like church, save that soul
That cry "good God, oh me, oh my!", I got to save them
All. Pray the Lord forever call on him
For setting the screen for evil things, then letting me ball on them
Pick and move, or you could die, nigga
Chuck and jive to stay alive, nigga
Propane flames burn your boots like strange perms
Some think "Don't take, will", but fuck it, you live and learn
Beware of the roots and salty looks
Voodoo they put on you, baby doll could leave you shook
Pens and needles, hoes and blokes
When it cracking, come snapping out even, kept them feelings afloat
I know, cause my folks lost souls off coast, never found
The triangle ain't just an ocean, it's on the ground
Take heed of the sign, dodging demons that find forgiveness
Young Krizzle

Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you1Embed
