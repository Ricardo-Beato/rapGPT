97 ContributorsSame Damn Time Lyrics
Y'all don't wanna play fair
(Sonny Digital)
Ya nah'mean? Ayy, chea!

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye

Gucci made in Italy, Bally belt, I'm killing shit
The way I'm rocking Jimmy Choo, the word got out I'm dealing it
I fuck her, she a immigrant, don't touch her, she ain't got benefits
Bussing down them Benjamins, fuck it up on Louis kicks
That's the way I'm kicking it, Ferragamo cover me
Puerto Rican, Japanese, we laid up at the DoubleTree
Yellow ice a bumblebee, pinky ring a quarter key
IPhone a Metro, twerking off the whole thing
My earring a jelly bean, gangster lean and Irene
Red eyes, no Visine, I'm loc'd out on the drink
Horse shoes on my jeans, Robin jeans with the wings
Yellow bone on my team, trafficking them Yao Mings
Space boots with the spikes, go to AZ on the flight
Mail a hundred overnight, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye

I'm in Phipps with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds 'round my neck, no fugazi
Bad bitches in the suite tryna bait me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit, tryna stretch it to another one
Drinking on that Actavis, it tasting like some bubblegum
Thumbing through the check, boarding on a jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
FreeBandz on Al Capone (Straight up)
And my cash way long (Turn up)
I see a bunch of clones
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye

Give me apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's outside Crim
Jumping 'cross me, you know your chances slim
In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes
When the cash hit cash money, smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers, making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler, jumping bail on your ring
Spent so much on Louis, gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan, take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film (Movie!)
Future (Ask, yeah, yeah)
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye11Embed
