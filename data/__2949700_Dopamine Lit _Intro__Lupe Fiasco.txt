55 ContributorsDopamine Lit (Intro) Lyrics
Yeah, and it got a soul, yeah
Uh-uh, what it do? What it say? Yeah, yeah
DROGAS, DROGAS, what it say? Yeah, yeah
DROGAS, DROGAS, what it say? What it say
DROGAS, DROGAS, yeah, yeah, yeah
DROGAS, DROGAS, DROGAS, trap, trap, DROGAS, DROGAS
DROGAS, DROGAS, DROGAS, nigga, uh
What it say? Yeah, yeah, yeah

Blood rushin' to my head like cold
Players on my mind like Shake', plays on my mind like stage
Stays for a while like fades
Fades to the black like Jay's
Wavin' from behind like Ks
Made it from behind like AIDS
Made it to the map like Waze
Take it to the trap like maze
Can't take you back like trades
Bae shake it in my lap like Jackie Joyner-Kersee havin' seizures
Jesus, what's a nonbeliever to a preacher?
This ain't the kind of rap the opps and the thots like
Told 'Trakk put the bat back on the spotlight
Cartagena, serve snacks at the cockfight (realest)
Need new batteries for the Glock lights (realest)
Put the mix on the oil 'til it lock tight (realest)
Cause they gave it to all the young niggas
DROGAS dedicated to all the drug dealers
Find out how they all gon' come kill us
Try Containment Unit, the walls, they can't fit us
Who the Ghostbusters gon' call to come get us? And
You might also like
Ayy, over-D off of this
But baby don't die 'til the dopamine hit, yo
Ayy, this one ain't for Billbo'
You can stream the album on Silk Road
Drug rings for more dough
So they baggin' like Bilbo
Jackin' like Jill for a pill at the Hollywood Hills though
Fame is a drit-ug
I want my name all lit up
And leave out the world how I came in the clitter
Over-D off of this
But don't fall asleep 'til the dopamine hit, hey

DROGAS, DROGAS, what it say? What it say?
DROGAS, DROGAS, yeah, yeah, yeah
DROGAS, DROGAS, DROGAS, trap, trap, DROGAS, DROGAS
DROGAS, DROGAS, DROGAS, nigga
DROGAS, DROGAS, what it say? What it say?
DROGAS, DROGAS, yeah, yeah, yeah
DROGAS, DROGAS, DROGAS, trap, trap, DROGAS, DROGAS
DROGAS, DROGAS, DROGAS, nigga

Big watch, big watch, you can see it
Lot of diamonds in the Cartier
'Less I'm thinkin' 'bout the money, I can't concentrate
Don't talk if you ain't ball enough to commentate, yeah
That's a Super Bowl every time I contemplate
Limited edition, bitches
I'm just livin' off the interest
I don't really care about niggas
Denzel, put the money in the blender
For the esés, shower posse with the SKs
For the haters that be hatin' on the Jefés
Half-naked hoes, they be dressin' just like X-rays
... Rated
All the way through, don't like nothin' plated
Simps think they got cool, I'm just stickin' to the basics
This-this-this-this-this-this-this
This one ain't for Billbo'
You can stream the album on Silk Road
Drug rings for more dough
So they baggin' like Bilbo
Jackin' like Jill for a pill at the Hollywood Hills, though
Fame is a drit-ug
I want my name all lit up
And leave out the world how I came in the clitter
Over-D off of this
But don't fall asleep 'til the dopamine hit, hey8Embed
