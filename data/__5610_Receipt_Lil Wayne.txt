43 ContributorsReceipt Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
(Yeah, to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, c'mon

Young bull
I know you love me like you never loved
You know you couldn't find a better thug
And, uh
You been peepin' me since I was younger
So young that you even called me your little brother
But I'm all grown up now, I got my own money
I'm married and divorced and my daughter is a woman
And guess what? My daughter want another
Sister or brother, and you lookin' like a mother
I took you from a clubber to a lover
And you took another bitch husband, the other bitch wasn't
Doin' shit for him
She say she did too much, I say she did nothing
She need to quit frontin'
I haven't hid nothin' and you love everything
Can't hide your feelings, won't let my pride conceal it
You got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby, you can keep the change, but
You might also like
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away

Destiny Child CD, song number three
She cater to me 'til we fall asleep
Then we wake up and we pick up where we started
Then she make a nigga breakfast, Sprite, orange juice, and water
And she on stage waitin' for me after my show
So no time for groupies, straight to the top floor, yeah
Fresh out the shower, a smile and a towel
Then after an hour, she gon' need another shower
When I'm at home in my coupe or in the office
Or the streets of the Boot, I'm thinking 'bout you
And most of the girls that come by are cute
And they try to holler, but they all on mute
And my old girls turn they face up at me, yeah
They throw they purses and they makeup at me
'Cause you got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby, you can keep the change, but
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away

Come home, smell the food on the stove
She done cleaned the whole house, washed the dishes and the clothes
And when we out, we do it just how we supposed
Look good for the public, leave the drama in the Rolls
Royce, choice of car that we move in
She get high sometimes 'cause I'm always doin' it, yeah
You hear them hallways, we always doin' it
Work her, every time feel like the first one
Perfect when a nigga stressin' at work
She take away all of the pain, make it lesser than dirt
That's why you got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby, you can keep the change, but

(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
(Yeah, to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need)
I got you
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt), yeah
It's kinda hard saying this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take her away12Embed
