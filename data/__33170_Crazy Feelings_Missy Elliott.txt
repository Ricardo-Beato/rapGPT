10 ContributorsCrazy Feelings Lyrics
I was in love
That's what it was when I met you
In love
And no one could ever talk about you
But it sucks, so many lies and alibis
In love

Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you

So in love
I just didn't see the wrong you did
In love
But now that I know I can admit
It was love that made me a fool, a silly fool
In love, oh crazy

Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
You might also like
You was always in my face, all the time
Even with 20/20 vision, I couldn't see you lie
You was always in my face, all the time
Even with 20/20 vision, I couldn't see you lie

Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you
Crazy feelings
Make me stay in love with you1Embed
