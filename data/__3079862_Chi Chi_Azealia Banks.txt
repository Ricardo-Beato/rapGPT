42 ContributorsChi Chi Lyrics
Hands up, it's a hold up
Keep them pies hot nigga, pack the heater in the holster
Slip the clip in and pop they tried to G me on the quota
I could picture ya noggin' rockin', you peasy on the corner
I stretch it with the soda
Whip the cream to the top, pot Betty with the shoulder
Got the keys to the drop top, but I'm in the Rover
Keep them fiends on that clock, clock, came to get the dough up

Niggas, I be wildin' for that cheddar, for that paper
Island hoppin' in Bahamas, helicopter to Jamaica
Puerto Rican papi got that product and that peso
Get that perico on Broadway
Chi Chi get the yayo
You know I'm about it, every dollar on the pay roll
Tell 'em niggas we be grindin' till the motherfuckin' day o'er
Bet you read about it, bet you plottin', bet you hatin'
Get that perico on Broadway
Chi Chi get the yay

Hear my Lexus purr, I just crept to Jers'
Got genuine leather interi and my texture fur
Icy bezel, I'm freezy and my necklace splurge
Watch me run up on them niggas with that tech and burst
Now niggas wreck their dough for my X and O
La Perla provocateur lace, I feed 'em sex and blow
Chi Chi got it from some gualas in Calexico
Click-c-click, blam, you be next to go
You might also like
Sittin' in the drop-top
Got money in my pocket, drugs in the glove box
I don't even like ya
(Don't wanna be nothin' near like ya)

All of my bitches get money they made
All of my niggas is handsome with waves
All of these rappers is pussy
You heard they be stuntin' on wax but they really afraid
You a hi-top with a cut on your fade
Harlem shaked in the middle of the fuckin' parade
Told you to put some respect on my name
And stop talkin' that shit, put that check on my name
Uh, put the check in my name
Weather advisory can't stop the rain
I do not have time to entertain lames
Won't say no names 'cause I won't give you fames
Gang-gang-gang-gang, bang-bang-bang-bang
My niggas gorillas and orangutans
Live from the zoo, this the new 212
When I move with the crew, y'all bird niggas can't hang

Niggas, I be wildin' for that cheddar, for that paper
Island hoppin' in Bahamas, helicopter to Jamaica
Puerto Rican papi got that product and that peso
Get that perico on Broadway
Chi Chi get the yayo
You know I'm about it, every dollar on the pay roll
Tell 'em niggas we be grindin' till the motherfuckin' day o'er
Bet you read about it, bet you plottin', bet you hatin'
Get that perico on Broadway
Chi Chi get the yayo12Embed
