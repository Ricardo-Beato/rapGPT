32 ContributorsLong Time Lyrics
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas
I done graduated from midget
Skrrt Skrrt Skrrt, pull up
Throwin' money out my ceiling
Young Rich
Nigga, fuck it, Yeah, this the life I'm livin'
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas
I done graduated from midget
Skrrt Skrrt Skrrt, pull up
Throwin' money out my ceiling
Young Rich
Nigga, fuck it. Yeah, this the life I'm livin'

Organize the spot
All the babies to the right
All the midgets to the left
Keep ya hands to yourself
I'mma buss it all down
I don't need no fuckin' help
Bales of gas to the steps
Get the cola off the shelf
I catch ya slippin'
I pity the fool
I take ya money, I spend it on jewels
Wipe him up, he bleedin', I'm bool
I'm not gay but I spend it on dudes
In a Regal on Bleveland
We killin' this evenin'
You throw me the pack, and you know I'm receivin'
A whole lotta gangsta bitches and they bleedin'
We teach em to sniff and they find and they keep it
Man petro everlastin'
Its my passion
Tryin' to take it, bitch I'm titan, you know we clashin'
Chanel down, walk up lavish, she know I'm splashin'
Came a long way from them corners, servin that ash

Young Rich
Nigga, fuck it Yeah, this the life I'm livin'

I know that my life is so great
You hungry, you know that we already ate
I do what I want and you gotta work late
I fuck em I don't take em out on a date
You love her and cuff her and take her to skate
I make her go cook, she sniffin' the plate
I came from the bottom, and now I got gwuap
My nigga they know that you is a cheapskate
Put it on my mama, I got commas
Niggas hit ya, with that Llama
Keep runnin' with that sack
I just took his hunnas
Pull up in that Audi, flexin' in the summer
I got 50 bricks, on the plane, comin' from Tijuana
Christian Louboutin , $550 a piece that cost a lot
My niggas sellin' larry kush, and you know my niggas keep chris rock
All ya'll niggas lookin' like balloons, my bullets they gone pop
Black Maybach, Black tints, Quavo feelin' like Barack
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 peas, straight gas
I done graduated from midgets
Skrrtt Skrrtt Skrrtt, pull up throwin' money out my ceiling
Young Rich Nigga, fuck it, yeah, different life I'm livin'
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas
I done graduated from midget
Skrrtt Skrrtt Skrrtt, pull up, Throwin' money out my ceiling
Young Rich
Nigga, fuck it Yeah, this the life I'm livin'

I was broke down on my knees
Took me a long long time
Wouldn't nobody give me shit
I had to grind grind grind
Remember them days, I had to finesse for checks
And buss on you flats, I came at yo neck with the tec
My niggas is vicious, they hungry for benji
Pull up at the trap, I boarded my windows
Rich nigga fuck them, I'm a young rich nigga still
Standin' on stage, blowin' propane
Fuck a Styrofoam, I'ma drink it out the seal,
Run up on Takeoff, make a nigga takeoff
That was A1, I ain't talkin' bout steak sauce
Me and thug throwed, and we need two cups
If my cup ain't double, its gone be some trouble
Came a long way, had to get it out the muscle
Now all my cars are muscles
Young nigga gotta get a hustle
Gotta use a wordplay like Ruzzle
If you want that cake, but you ain't got that cake
Gotta get out there and make somethin' shake
Got the 45 put it to a nigga face, rich nigga eatin' steak on Hermes plates
NO! I ain't never goin' broke, Early in the morning on the stove
Wrist spinnin' like a hurricane
Ice chain came from Johnny Dang
Real heavy on my neck I need a cane
All white bitch cocaine
I'm whippin' that birdy, with none of that whitney
That Brittney come with a free chicken, I live it
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas
I done graduated from midgets
Skrrt Skrrt Skrrt, pull up throwin' money out my ceiling
Young Rich Nigga, fuck it, yeah, different life I'm livin'
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas
I done graduated from midget
Skrrt Skrrt Skrrtt, pull up, Throwin' money out my ceiling
Young Rich
Nigga, fuck it Yeah, this the life I'm livin'16Embed
