Sayin' that I'm Hollywood, Hollywood
I don't (?) Hollywood, Hollywood
If I ever go Hollywood, Hollywood
I'mma always keep it HollyHood, HollyHood
Because I gotta sack, I'm never turnin' back
I don't know how to act, the haters kiss my ass
I'm Hollywood, Hollywood
I'mma always keep it HollyHood, HollyHood

I'm a big dog, aka timberwolf
I'm lookin' for Ms. Berry in HollyHood
Talkin' curves like a horn, I'm a fuckin' bull
Do it pass me a pipe, no goon
Leanin' like a motherfuckin' kickstand
I'll kill any man
I'm on HollyHood's ass
But I do got Hollywood plans
And I need a (?) cause my man's like Hollywood plan
But it is on the way though
The ho play with my dick like play-dough
I got a big a-go, oops I mean ego
But I eat her like an Eggo
And she drink me like (?)
You might also like
Sayin' that I'm Hollywood, Hollywood
I don't (?) Hollywood, Hollywood
If I ever go Hollywood, Hollywood
I'mma always keep it HollyHood, HollyHood
Because I gotta sack, I'm never turnin' back
I don't know how to act, the haters kiss my ass
I'm Hollywood, Hollywood
I'mma always keep it HollyHood, HollyHood

I'm lookin' at my Rollie, it's about that time
I see them niggas slickin' but they can't stop my grind
I'mma keep on grindin', keep on shinin'
Get where you can't stand
It's Aston Martin Philos, I'm livin' in the fast lane
In the club throwin' money up, I see her watchin' me
Throw another band, give 'em more reason to rob me
You know I keep that .40 and you know I got my 40 homie
And you can go and ask the big homies
In the (?) with my (?), you know I'm pimpin' shit
Them boonies been cutthroat, they flexin' (?) half of it
If you want it we got it
And if you cockin' we robbin'

Sayin' that I'm Hollywood, Hollywood
I don't (?) Hollywood, Hollywood
If I ever go Hollywood, Hollywood
I'mma always keep it HollyHood, HollyHood
Because I gotta sack, I'm never turnin' back
I don't know how to act, the haters kiss my ass
I'm Hollywood, Hollywood
I'mma always keep it HollyHood, HollyHood
If a nigga can't read then (?) flip the script
But ya'll weren't with me when I took them trips
300 pounds and they stuffed in the salon
I get pulled over, I won't see tomorrow
But I ain't trippin', I'm a G about the situation
Pull up on me, give ya something, pay your probation
Hollywood, I ain't never that
But when I get to Hollywood, I ain't comin' back
I'mma hustler so I grind like it's my last night
But like a college student I gotta get this paper right
(?) so give us five mics
(?)

Sayin' that I'm Hollywood, Hollywood
I don't (?) Hollywood, Hollywood
If I ever go Hollywood, Hollywood
I'mma always keep it HollyHood, HollyHood
Because I gotta sack, I'm never turnin' back
I don't know how to act, the haters kiss my ass
I'm Hollywood, Hollywood
I'mma always keep it HollyHood, HollyHood1Embed
