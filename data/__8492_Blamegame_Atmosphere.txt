16 ContributorsBlamegame Lyrics
Yo, yo, yo

I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand pretend you know my man
Blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game

To cold dis another's a thing that we love
So here's another one to get jealous of, do it Ja!

So push your hand up if you remember the Juice Crew
They don't make em' like they used to
This supposed to be the new school?
Your guns are aimless, songs are nameless
How long you been famous?
I claim this region two hundred-mile radius
Twin Cities' flavors Rhymesayers got the tastiest
And you can hate me, it's part of the territory
As long as you know it's impossible to ignore me
From middle fingers to hugs, tofu to the drugs
The fight's fists, might as well just take pictures of Slug
And live out your own life to the fullest
Why you starin' at my feet when you're standin' in this bullshit?
You could never learn how to ride a bike without balance
So what's the point of trying to grab the mic without talents
Go get your brakes looked at, you fucking fake hood rat
Wanna be the basement's greatest? Too late, already took that!
Father knows best, but Father knows stress
But Father needs love, a back rub, and some rest
Damn he could use a good home cooked meal
Been burnin' both ends since he broke the seal
Up, up and away, watch him take off
Give himself a little hell and quit the day job
And ignite the sunlight, tryin' to write about life
About face, break the fear, and you're here till the plight
You might also like
And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand pretend you know my name
And blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game

Cats be walkin' into the spot like they own it
Wearin' a face that they should save for they opponents
With the shoelaces tied, yet too wasted to drive
Either way I've arrived to bless this place with my vibe
Yeah right, my vibe ain't even cool
I sit in the corner and drink until I slur and drool
The t-shirt says "Shoot pool, not people
Kill time, not life, grab the mic and let the beat go"
(Beat go beat go beat go)
But that's good for me
It's hard to hide a magic card when you wear a short sleeve
Force feed what I've got when they not hungry
Tryin' to replace everything that they ripped off from me
Bloat the tummy, and choke the dummy theory
Beat the point dead until these folks hear me clearly
Keep it all simple, a simplistic intricate
Rebuild the robots with bigger tits and little fists
Repo man, a world full of slow jams
Grab the prize and clutch it tight with both hands
Why go to serve tall talk?
Anyone that calls this fall off can suck my balls off
I ain't goin' nowhere, I'm still here, right here
Same spot that I stood when you first woke up
The same guy that grabbed the mic and made your girl wanna fuck
The same MC still runnin' on an empty tank of luck
And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Here take my hand, pretend you know my name
And blame it all on the game, blame it all on the game
And I wish that I had something to say
That could wipe that smile right off of your face
Come here take my hand, pretend you know

Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
Blame it all on the game (Blame it all on the game)
