28 ContributorsLoving You No More Lyrics
So hard to breathe this air that we call love (ooh)
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love (ooh yeah)
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself

Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try

So many tears I cried
But all for nothin' I’m afraid to say
Oh
You might also like
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself (no, woah)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be loving you no more (no, no, baby)
I love you more than I love myself

I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life, ain't the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me

So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh

Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more  (I can't) (Diddy)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, no, baby) (Drizzy baby, uh uh)
I love you more than I love myself
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure

So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…

Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, lovin' you no more)
I love you more than I love myself (no, no)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, woah)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more (oh, no)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (just wanna love you baby)
I love you more than I love myself (just wanna love you baby)3Embed
