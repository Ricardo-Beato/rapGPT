19 ContributorsAnomaly Lyrics

Yeah
This is another story, another anomaly (Mm-mm)
Oh, we'll make it gory (Mmm), the ears will bleed (Mm-eh-mm)
This is another story (Mmm), of an anomaly (Mmm)
I don't know what's taking long (Mmm), I'm still taking long (Mmm)

I'ma free roaming animal (Hmm), I'ma free roaming animal (Hmm)
I'ma free roaming animal (Hmm), and I like to feed
I'ma free roaming animal, I'ma free roaming animal
I'ma free roaming animal, and I like to feed

I see you make that camera, the goose on the beach (Mmm)
Oh beautiful horror (Mmm), this is a beautiful horror (Hmm-mm)
This is another story of another anomaly (Mmm)
We'll make it gory (Mmm), the ears will bleed

Oh, oh
Save him, save him, save him, save him
