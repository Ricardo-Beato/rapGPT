16 ContributorsTil I Die Lyrics
S-I-C-K B-O-I
You should come join us nigga, we so fly
Highlighter colors, brand new sneaks
Sick Bois stick together in a pinch like cheeks
We the new Lost Boys, I'm Peter Pan
'Cause I'm in the bright green, Tinkerbell on my hand
We can run house parties, my name ain't Play
But you's a kid, you should be on your way
Colors like barkers, hoodies like Parkers
Haters on my dick, take a bite like sharkers
I'ma stay weirdo, I'm a straight hero
Haters on the side makin' numbers like zero
I'ma get flyer, numbers get higher
You would stop movin' like a flat tire
I'm not The Wire but I'm like Michael
Custom birdie green, they on dookie like fire

We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
You might also like
I'm sick like a hospital, whether you're in pain or not
I'm crazy like a swastika inside of a bagel shop
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch! Unstoppable
Think of me as hurricanes cause rappers are incomparable
Most of y'all insufferable, soundin' like a board scratch
Rappers are like ants to me, I stab 'em in the thorax
Lyrically a metaphor, Atlanta's only troubadour
Face it; only seen by a few like a unicorn
I'ma try to get my swagger right, like I'm Dolemite
Spread it all around to the kids like it's Vegemite
Get the proper etiquette, bitch you from Connecticut!
I'ma try to modify the subject like a predicate
I'm not the best rapper but I'm better than you
You with a big pickle like your name was Stu
I'm a Sick Boi, that's just how we do
Even your name's a game like you DJ Clue

We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die1Embed
