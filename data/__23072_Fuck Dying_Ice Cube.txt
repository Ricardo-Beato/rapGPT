25 ContributorsFuck Dying Lyrics
 Ice Cube
Ice Cube!
 That's Don Mega to you, you cocksucker
 I am the Angel of Death
And your name is on my list
 Sheeyit!
 Come with me..
 I ain't goin nowhere wit yo' ass
And if you put your hands on me, we gettin down right here
Don Mega
Don Mega
Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army!
Join the party, I can provide the army!!
Join the party, I can provide the army!!!

Come and hear the voice of the man they call the Trojan Horse
Ride on the outside, with inner force
Throw you off course, of course, you missed the runway
We mash, like the first kickoff, on a Sunday
Collisions, divisions of niggas, down to listen
And when we on the mission, call your mortician
Join the party, I can provide the army
First we flank 'em then we spank 'em.. I outrank 'em
You might also likeYou can call me Citizen Kane for my reign
Ten years straight, one of the ten great
Mr. Media, look inside your encyclopedia
2002, see Ice Cube
Fuck a five-star, I'm a live star
What you got to die for? Who you wanna ride for?
Fuck dying! (Fuck dying!)
Don Mega
Don Mega

It's the suspect king of the roughnecks, bonafide
Worldwide, your highness, the finest
Big as China, nigga rhymer, chart climber
Quick to send a first-timer back to his Aunt Jemimah
Physi-cal, nigga roll with the winners
After these dinners, go out and represent us
We got antennas, scanners and satellites
To see if you battle right, we got to bite
Hold on tight, shake and pump venom
Some haters don't learn till you leave lead in 'em
See the dead in 'em, rigor mortis spread in 'em
Keep your mouth shut, motherfuckin' mouth slug
See these crossed legs, quick to cross Feds
Foe to mighty one, it's the mighty son
Fuck dying, yeah

Join the party, I can provide the army
Join the party, I can provide the army!
Join the party, I can provide the army!!
Join the party, I can provide the army!!!
Fuck dying, I can provide the army
Fuck dying, I can provide the army
Fuck dying, I can provide the army
Fuck dying, I can provide the army
Join the party!
In the ghetto, in the ghetto
In the city, the suburbs.. penitentiary
Join the party
In the county
Fuck dying, fuck dying
Join the party, I can provide the army (yeayay)
Join the party, I can provide the army (yeayay)
Join the party, I can provide the army (yeayay)
Join the party, I can provide the army (fuck dying)
I can provide the army
I can provide the army
I can provide the army

Eternal life baby

Hear ye, hear ye!
All connect gang members and powers
Are to meet at the West Wing
To be led into battle by the one and only
Ice Cube the Great!3Embed
