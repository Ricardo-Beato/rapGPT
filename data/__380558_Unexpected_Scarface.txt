6 ContributorsUnexpected LyricsYea, I look all the times I fought
And look at all the times I lost
Was it worth what i would sacrafice if I was shot down
And died that night shake them dice nigga
You gamble when the stakes get high
When you crap you can't cuz no mistakes allowed
In this, stuggle, stuggles we be facing
Smuggled in dope in small towns blazing
At the niggas who insisted resistance
Left out sivalized but came back trippin'
With nines spittin but mine hit 'em
That was his wake up call lay down nigga
Or die nigga, cuz this is big boy shit
Big boy crumbs to bricks move
I'm bout to take control of the block and I don't give
A fuck if niggas like it or not they gone respect it
You niggas gone respect my mind
You niggas gone respect my G
You niggas gone respect this paper, you haters ain't fucking with me
You niggas gone respect my mind
You niggas gone respect my G
You niggas gone respect this paper, you haters ain't fucking with me
I'm siting in the backseat riding
Staring at the dashboard vibin
Mack drivin, 22's boxed up in bags
Dope houses surrounding, see the feds want my motherfucking
Head on a gilatine, ain't like a motherfucker scared
Though, I'd rather die then for me to be alive and be
Relying on the next man to front a nigga 9
Cuz thats nothing it would be a murder if it came to
That, cuz im a motherfucking gangsta jack
And thats how motherfucking ganstas act
You better bring your strap you shoot first but when
I make it back, ill invade that traps
Made the gats, shut the block down
Y'all niggas ain't made for that
But when I spark yo ass off and i spark the k ain't
Shit left that yall can say but dawg I respect it
You might also likeYou niggas gone respect my mind
You niggas gone respect my G
You niggas gone respect this paper, you haters ai't fucking with me
You niggas gone respect my mind
You niggas gone respect my G
You niggas gone respect this paper, you haters ain't fucking with me
You make your moves undetected
The first to think the last one expected
I can't help it if he refuse to move
Like I been telling him to
Stupid nigga I ain't treatnin you
I'm making promises dude, and when I count to two
And you still sitin here like a got damn fool I'm through
That's when them niggas come through
Doin' what they came in to do, all unexpectedEmbed
