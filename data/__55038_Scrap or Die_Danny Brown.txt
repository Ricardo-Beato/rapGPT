41 ContributorsScrap or Die Lyrics
Looking at this crib for about a whole month
Family live there, they got put out last month
My uncle sniffing blow while I'm rollin' up a blunt
His homie in the basement smokin' crack with my aunt
Tonight's that night, we about to get right
Piled up in a van with a couple flashlights
Metal crowbar gon' get us through the door
Take everything, nigga, fuck the landlord
So now we at the place, skullys on, bare face
'Bout to leave this bitch bare, strip the whole damn place
My unc' took outside, he rippin' down the gutters
So we inside tearin' up this motherfucker
Bust open the walls just to get the wiring
Took the hot water tank and leftover appliances
Aluminum siding and had to come back
'Cause the furnace so big, it wouldn't fit in the back

Now, it's copper by the pound (Pound), wire by the inch (Inch)
Got a check on the first and it's gone by the fifth (Yeah)
Scrap or die, nigga
And you might be laughing at it 'cause you know this shit is true (True)
Rusty flatbed truck the color of doo-doo (Haha)
Scrap or die, nigga
You might also like
Early morning next day, at the junkyard
Got four loads, 'bout to get broke off
But these niggas slick, man, I swear, I'm goin' off
Put the work on the scale and I swear that bitch was off
'Cause I know we had way more than that
But fuck it, split it up, ayy, I get more than that
These niggas always slick, on that bullshit
Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit
So we back in the hood, plot the next lick
Got a school closed down and I think we should hit it
Just waiting on my unc' to get back from the clinic
And we gon' go over there to see what's up with it
Now, we up in it, takin' old computers
Until we fuckin' heard, "Don't move or I shoot you"
Fucked up the hook, caught us tryna cash in
Now, we got a B&E case and trespassing

Now, it's copper by the pound (Pound), wire by the inch (Inch)
Got a check on the first and it's gone by the fifth (Yeah)
Scrap or die, nigga
And you might be laughing at it 'cause you know this shit is true (True)
Rusty flatbed truck the color of doo-doo (Haha)
Scrap or die, nigga1Embed
