8 ContributorsPut A Hole In Yo Back Lyrics

I come through, niggas be screwing their face up at me
I'm like why they looking like that?
Got a sawed off sixteen gauge shotgun with me
I'll put a big ass hole in yo back
Nigga, I don't know what you heard about me
That got you looking like that
But I'll shoot, you know I'm on some bullshit, fucking with me
I'll put a big ass hole in yo back

Yeah, nigga what? You're now rocking with the livest
Beams on the llamas, New York City's finest
A drug dealer's dream, red jag, rim shining
Four shooters riding in the trucks right behind us
It ain't my fault man, the hood made me grimy
I hustle, get my weight up, them niggas got to move
Only the strong survive, the weak getting bent up

I come through, niggas be screwing their face up at me
I'm like why they looking like that?
Got a sawed off sixteen gauge shotgun with me
I'll put a big ass hole in yo back
Nigga, I don't know what you heard about me
That got you looking like that
But I'll shoot, you know I'm on some bullshit, fucking with me
I'll put a big ass hole in yo back

Yeah, nigga what? You're now rocking with the livest
Beams on the llamas, New York City's finest
A drug dealer's dream, red jag, rim shining
Four shooters riding in the trucks right behind us
It ain't my fault man, the hood made me grimy
I hustle, get my weight up, them niggas got to move
Only the strong survive, the weak getting bent up
After they blow trial and that ass get sent up
Niggas in the pens gon hear this and lose they mind
Come home possessed by the music, and use that nine
I was in Sean C crib when I wrote my first verse
Stuck niggas in front of Edgemere and let my gat burst
I ain't had no money then, I was in and out of cash
Wearing blue Nike Cortez from V.I.M's damn
Went to Eddie's for gold teeth, Benny's for the shines
Had on eight ball jackets to cover up the nines
Barrel link chains,  rings
Damn fools I rob em for like all kind of bling
This is not a fiction homeboy it's fact
Certain kings paint problem child on my back

I come through, niggas be screwing their face up at me
I'm like why they looking like that?
Got a sawed off sixteen gauge shotgun with me
I'll put a big ass hole in yo back
Nigga, I don't know what you heard about me
That got you looking like that
But I'll shoot, you know I'm on some bullshit, fucking with me
I'll put a big ass hole in yo back3Embed
