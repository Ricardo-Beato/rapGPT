Sosa baby
GBE baby
Bang, bang, bang bang
Bang
Ftftftftft
Beep, beep, beep, beep
Yeah
Let's get it

(Sosa baby)
Boy you can keep that, you ain't smokin' on no dope (GBE baby, dope)
You ain't tryna spend shit, you ain't holding on no rolls (Beep, beep, beep)
In Hawaii with the gang, and I'm hollerin' out on folks (GBE baby)
Walked up in LV, you know I gotta pull out them O's (Louis, Louis, catch up, catch up)
Comma zero, zero, Comma zero, zero or more (Cash)
Beat the case, no P.O or no piss test, no (Nah, nah, Sosa baby)
In a foreign drivin' real fast, they thinkin' that I'm on coke (Skrrt, skrrt)
You can set the difficulties, either way I am in my mode (Sosa baby, GBE baby)

No bitch get set wet, choppers stutter like rat-tat (Bang, bang)
Actin' like you knee deep, you go fuck around and get your fuckin' neck wet (Bang, bang)
Still spendin' cheese, no major come back for set back (Beep, beep, beep)
Smack a nigga with a box of dots, tell a fuck nigga to connect that
I don't get my hand dirty, but bitch I'm in it like a wet back (Yeah, yeah)
Went and bought 4 PT's, threw the cash on the floor, check that (Lean, lean)
All this cash that I'm throwin' in the club, lil nigga try to match that (Nah, yeah)
I'm a sinister, take a lil nigga face and blast that (Bang, bang)
Like the light in the car, it's a fuckin' Diablo (Skrrt, skrrt)
I was buyin' real estate when Kayne drop Pablo (Sosa baby)
I was in Mexico gettin' heat from my vatos (Bang, bang)
Pull up to the gang, get the beef for your taco (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
