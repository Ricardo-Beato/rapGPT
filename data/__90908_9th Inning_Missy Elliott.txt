19 Contributors9th Inning Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Check it, yeah!

Now I'm in the 9th inning
Thought I fell off, ain't quite finished
Yeah, I'm 'bout to put my foot in it
Talk with it, walk with it, I'm no gimmick (Yeah!)
2012 there'll be no games, real rap, real bars, I'm not playing
Haters y'all lame, you a Missy fan
I'm a beast in the booth, I'm just sayin' (Yeah!)
I make 'em wanna get low
Duck with it, buck with it, let's go
Every time I spit a rhyme, it's a sick flow
You newcomers better sit back and take note (Yeah!)
This here my time
Here I come, better run, take what's mine
'Bout to let off like a TEC-9
This rhyme gon make 'em push rewind (Yeah!)
Yeah I'm so hot, up on the charts, number one spot
See me when I drop, and I won't flop
Missy never stop, got the music game on lock (Yeah!)
Wanna get served?
You third, you second, but I come first
Flip my verse like I flip birds
I'm fire, yes sir

We hit makin', hit breakin'
Party shakin', innovative
Groundbreakin', so creative
We be the most anticipated
Hit makin', hit-breakin'
Party-shakin', innovative
Groundbreakin', so creative
We be the most anticipated

Ayo Timbaland
They thought it was over
We on that next shit
They're back! What?!

Now I'm in the 9th inning
Niggas think I fell when I'm still winnin'
So I been gone for a hot minute
I love this shit, that's why I got a gift in it (Yeah)
Fuck nigga, get fly
Nigga can't talk wit' a gun in the mouth
Niggas bitch up, bet they run in the house
I can smell bullshit when it walk by (Yeah)
Heard that old saying, yo
Never ever cross the one that give ya most
Never ever act funny for the white folks
I'm a big fish, remember you a tadpole (Yeah)
I like Lady Gaga
Why you let a nigga do your whole album?
Where you think that fake producer got their style from?
Come fuck with a nigga, watch the outcome (Yeah)
Ain't no real artists
Wack talent get in real starvin'
All you hear in music is the chorus
Well that's okay, Timmy back in the story
We hit makin', hit breakin'
Party shakin', innovative
Groundbreakin', so creative
We be the most anticipated
Hit makin', hit-breakin'
Party-shakin', innovative
Groundbreakin', so creative
We be the most anticipated

Y'all can't be serious
We break records, I done told y'all
How many of y'all got a catalogue this long?
Don't worry, I'll wait!

Down to the 9th inning
I'm the real deal, y'all pretending
Years later, my songs still spinning
I do record deals no less than ten milli  (Yeah!)
My hits be yay long
My songs go on like a marathon
Get ghost, get gone, you a dum-dum
Better 'round here, come on bite this like a python (Yeah!)
Wanna act fly?
Wanna act like you better than the M-I
Shakin 'em, bakin 'em all like a bean pie
Takin' 'em, burnin 'em down like I'm Left Eye (Yeah!)
Futuristic
Y'all can pack it up, I done ripped it
When you say my name, call me Miss Bitch
I make the next chick run to the exit (Yeah!)
Yeah I got a sick sense
I'm making this a movie like a Netflix
I'm on the guest list, on the checklist
I'm the flyest chick, now tell me who the best is! (Yeah!)
Elliott be the name
Elliott back in the game
Elliott hit it with a bang
Bring the hook back in, Timbaland
We hit makin', hit breakin'
Party shakin', innovative
Groundbreakin', so creative
We be the most anticipated
Hit makin', hit-breakin'
Party-shakin', innovative
Groundbreakin', so creative
We be the most anticipated

Did y'all forget?! I think they forgot!
They think we done
All we do is make hits?!

Man, if you wanna hit?
Maybe we'll return your call
Don't call collect
You have a collect call from... (Beep)2Embed
