5 ContributorsTrap Or Die (Mixtape Version) Lyrics
Last time I checked I was the man on these streets
They call me residue, I leave blow in these beats
Got diarrhea flow, now I shit on niggas (geah)
Even when I'm constipated I still shit on niggas (let's get it)
Got some Super Friends in the Legion of Doom
Stay blowin purple shit that keep me high like the moon
(yeahh) I'm an affiliate, I know hitmen
I'm a hater like you, fuck my wrist then
Niggas sneak dissin', that ain't how we play
Fuck with mine, get ya drama like the DJ (that's right)
Now tell me I ain't real, this AR that I'm holdin got a gangsta grill
Went from old school Chevys, to Beamer coupes
Got a hundred niggas with me and errybody gon shoot (yeahh)
Try me nigga, that's your first mistake (ha-ha)
Eat your lil' ass up like a chanterelle plate
The whole pie like Domino's, yes indeed
I'm tryna stack my bacon up, I need extra cheese (hey)
You can try dawg, but it ain't easy (nope)
Mix the flake with the soda, you got Young Jeezy (damnn)
You still wanna talk blow man?
Soft white like Alaska, call me snowman (heyy)

Smoke purp' by the pound, O's by the fifth
Re-up on the first then again on the fifth (yeahhh)
We trap or die nigga (geah, oh!), we trap or die nigga
And these hoes love a nigga cause they know that we the truth
Got the Chevy same color Tropicana orange juice (yeahhh)
We trap or die nigga (geah, oh!), we trap or die nigga
You might also like
Post on the block, rain, sleet, snow, sunny (sunny)
Slow motion, don't nothin move but the money (geah)
Trap all day (day), with no lunch breaks (nope)
It's dinner time but a gangsta cookin pancakes (ha-ha!)
Rubberbands when we wrap them stacks (stacks)
Time to ship it outta town, you know Saran's the wrap (yeahhh)
Think ahead incase the K-9's get loose (geah)
Inner tubes like the tires on my Mongoose (heyy)

Smoke purp' by the pound, O's by the fifth
Re-up on the first then again on the fifth (yeahhh)
We trap or die nigga (geah, oh!), we trap or die nigga
And these hoes love a nigga cause they know that we the truth
Got the Chevy same color Tropicana orange juice (yeahhh)
We trap or die nigga (geah, oh!), we trap or die nigga

Yeah, back up in the hood again, where it's all good again
Ridin candy slab, grippin on the wood again
Outta line niggas get back in place where you should've been
In case you don't understand, I'mma make it understood again
King of the underground, my gangsta will never fail
You 'bout to make me go postal for fuckin with my mail
You got the connect, but you ain't got the clientele
You the hoax and niggas know it, that shit ain't hard to tell
Rat bitch, recognize that your cheese ain't finna sell
I'm finna break some bread with the feds? You dumb as hell
I been around the block before, sold it all from rock to blow
And I don't fuck around, when the feds in town I got to go
Respect my mind cause I'm a trill old schooler
Summer time get too hot, I wait for winter when its cooler
U.G.K. for life, free the Pimp, you know the deal
In P.A.T. it's Trap or Die and we ain't down for gettin killed
Smoke purp' by the pound, O's by the fifth
Re-up on the first then again on the fifth (yeahhh)
We trap or die nigga (geah, oh!), we trap or die nigga
And these hoes love a nigga cause they know that we the truth
Got the Chevy same color Tropicana orange juice (yeahhh)
We trap or die nigga (geah, oh!), we trap or die niggaEmbed
