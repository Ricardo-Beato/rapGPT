Yea, Sexy
It's the real visionary national anthem right here
When this shit come on
You already know...
Trey, what else?

Bitch you know you're sexy with your sexy ass
Girl you know you're sexy with your sexy ass
Bitch you know you flexin' with your sexy ass
Girl you know you flexin' with your flexin' ass
We just call you sexy 'cause you know you're sexy
Gon' do your sexy, let 'em know you're sexy
And I ain't gotta say it, girl, you know you're sexy
And he ain't gotta tell you, bitch you know you're sexy

Two for two, you got a sexy face and body
Can't forget the legs, bitch you must do pilates
This ain't a mothafuckin' funeral, boy y'all actin' dead
You mothafuckas stand around, let's fuck up some bread
Uh, hope you bitches ready, here come the confetti
And the shit I'm smokin' on louder than a Chevy
Toe taggin' bitches, yeah she got a body
Just paid my tab and that's a Maserati
Dead people in my pocket, it's a cemetery
C-notes in my pocket, they on dictionary
I'ma get a room, she gon' get the broom
Bad boy on that ass, she gon' get the loom
You might also like
Bitch you know you're sexy with your sexy ass
Girl you know you're sexy with your sexy ass
Bitch you know you flexin' with your sexy ass
Girl you know you flexin' with your flexin' ass
We just call you sexy 'cause you know you're sexy
Gon' do your sexy, let 'em know you're sexy
And I ain't gotta say it, girl, you know you're sexy
And he ain't gotta tell you, bitch you know you're sexy

I told her, I swear to God she make a nigga hate a rubber
If you got hair on that pussy I'll shampoo it for you
Hashtag, hashtag, #CleanPussyMatters
Get naked right now and you ain't gon' smell nada
Let me take you to the crib, baby, break you in
Hit you from the back like tryna get your second wind
Put that arch in your back with your sexy ass
If you is on birth control I'll wet your ass
S-E-X.... Y
I do you with the I
Shawty got that ass that I like
What kind? With the tiger stripes

Bitch you know you're sexy with your sexy ass
Girl you know you're sexy with your sexy ass
Bitch you know you flexin' with your sexy ass
Girl you know you flexin' with your flexin' ass
We just call you sexy 'cause you know you're sexy
Gon' do your sexy, let 'em know you're sexy
And I ain't gotta say it, girl, you know you're sexy
And he ain't gotta tell you, bitch you know you're sexy
I just wanna hit you in your Louboutins
Take it all off, leave on your Louboutins
I came to gladiate, bitch I'm a gladiator
I'm like why you wearin' panties? I'm a panty hater
Pussy is amazin' but she crazy though
And that's word to Dae Dae, here come that crazy hoe
All eyes on you when you walk in
Straight killin' these bitches, bring the chalk then
Actin' brand new, girl, you know I know you
Bitch you drive a white Beamer, shop at Fashion Nova
Black Chanel bag, no ID
Say you tryna find her, she on IG

Tre, yeah
What up? She got it from her mama, yeah
Mama probably sexy as a mothafucka too, you know
This that sexy anthem nigga
What else?

Bitch you know you're sexy with your sexy ass
Girl you know you're sexy with your sexy ass
Bitch you know you flexin' with your sexy ass
Girl you know you flexin' with your flexin' ass
We just call you sexy 'cause you know you're sexy
Gon' do your sexy, let 'em know you're sexy
And I ain't gotta say it, girl, you know you're sexy
And he ain't gotta tell you, bitch you know you're sexyEmbed
