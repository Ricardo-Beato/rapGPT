31 ContributorsHATE THE REAL ME Lyrics
Zaytoven
Feel me
The music special
It's a part of us
I know I'm a product of the streets
I remember days you would laugh with me
See a frown on your pretty faces
Yeah

I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can, can, can

Open up a seal, don't feel me
Showing out in public show the real me
Pouring up in public, damn, I hate the real me
My mama stressing out, she say these drugs got me
And I ain't been the same since that nigga shot me
Holding on that K, I hope you feel me
Loading up the cartridge right now, I hate the real me
Voices in my head, "you the enemy"
I got a portrait in my head, I built a dynasty
I gotta focus on this bread, you tryna marry me
Couple exotic ones in the bed, tryna share me
Few exotics going out they way, tryna smash me
She told her mama she tried to smash me
She told her friends she tried to smash me
She told her ex she tryna smash me
She told the world she tryna smash me
I'm in the last lane, fast speed
I do helluva ways, baby, go to South Beach
I do helluva ways, baby, let your mouth speak
I do helluva ways, baby, let your body talk

I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can, can, can

Lemme tell the world how much I care for you
I paint a picture, gave a style to you
I took a chance when you had miles on you
I should've fucked and blowed some loud on you
I'm in the cut, I got a crowd on me
Infatuation turn to love on me
A sober mind wasn't good for me
'Cause I love you way more than this music
That's when shit was brought up and you know I had to lose it
Damn, I almost lost it
Said it was cheaper not to keep her and it's killing me
'Cause damn, I hate the real me
Damn, I hate the real me
'Cause damn, I hate the real me

Yeah, yeah
Zaytiggy
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get high as I can, can, can
Damn, I hate the real me
Damn, I hate the real me
Few exotics, they tryna share
Tryna find a true love, you can't compare
I'm tryna get high as I can
I'm tryna get fly as I can
I'm tryna get fly as I can, can, can3Embed
