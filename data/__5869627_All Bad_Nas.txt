52 ContributorsAll Bad Lyrics
To all the ones I loved across the world, uh-huh
It was all good 'til it went bad (Hit-Boy)

It's all bad
It was all good 'til she went bad
Damn, I hate to take a loss
Damn, it hurts to take a loss (She went bad on me, y'all)
It's all bad
It's all good 'til it's all bad
Damn, I hate to take a loss (She went bad on me, y'all)
Damn, it hurts to take a loss

Time passes by, I'm asking, "Why?"
You match my fly, no cap, no lie
Trophy, arm candy, but I'm better without it
It's a dub, my love, but I gotta reroute it
It's a lottery, it's loaded, hope I can see all the motives
Before she make a fool out of me, I should know 'cause I'm older
Wasn't meant for me, fuck it, we ain't agree on no subject
We look good together when we was out in the public
You used to brighten my day, had me hype as a kid
First, good morning, good night, now she leave me on read
I'm disappointed, it's different chicks who want it
Can't lie, for a minute, I was sick to my stomach
You might also like
You need to stop, breathe, think
Before you say the wrong thing
And I wish I could stay the night
But I feel some type of way about it
I've been stayin' up late
Thinking about this day (Yeah)
And I wish I could stay the night
But I feel some type of way about it, aw yeah

And it's all bad (All bad, all bad)
I might have to just fall back, fall back
Damn, I hate to take a loss (Man, I hate to take a loss)
Damn, it hurts to take a loss
It's all bad (All bad, mmh)
You got some problems that I just can't solve, no, no, no
Damn, I hate to take a loss
Damn, it hurts to take a loss (Take a loss)

I don't love you, girl, that's far from true
Even took you to the barbecue
That should show how I much I fuck with you
I know I gotta make the choice, shit is overdue
I had to let you off, might have to take a loss
I might have to take a loss, take a loss
I kinda like it when I'm far from you lately
I'm kinda fed up with the bullshit you do
You need to stop, breathe, think
Before you say the wrong thing
And I wish I could stay the night
But I feel some type of way about it
I've been stayin' up late
Thinking about this day (Yeah)
And I wish I could stay the night
But I feel some type of way about it, aw yeah

Yeah, since Guess was spotted on my denim pockets
And my wave grease would amaze geeks and freeze fly chicks
Where they stood, I never lost the steps, stay splashin'
Not one of these just got money, not knowin' how to act
New to these bad ones, I was on fly chicks since junior high
Beautiful fly girls caught my eye
Takin' down some of the girls Drake and Future took down
But I got no time for juveniles throwing tantrums
Texting me that they hate my one-word answers
Here's two, call me, this is you stalling
Guess we through, you ignore me, days go by
Missing you be the worst, play the game, who gon' hit who first
Checking my Yachtmaster, Pac blaster
Wonder why they call you bitch, empty shot glasses
Scrolling back on the thread, the nice things you once said
Look at us now, it's all bad
Aw yeah, and it's all bad
You know I might have to just fall back, fall back
Damn, I hate to take a loss (Man, I hate to take a loss)
Damn, it hurts to take a loss (Oh)
It's all bad (All bad, all bad)
You got some problems, I can't solve 'em all, uh, uh, uh
Damn, I hate to take a loss  (Man, I hate to take a loss)
Damn, it hurts to take a loss

Damn, I love it when you talk to me crazy
But who the fuck you think you talking to?6Embed
