1 Contributor1 (PEace) Lyrics
So long ago, the story go
I testify, I occupy
All the battlin' and wrasslin' on Capitol Hill
Now the pill got you ill and y'all digit-ill
I dig the dig, been off the pig
Diggin' the digital and I never reneged
Slow down, they want a slower damn sound machine
Who, me? They don't even know what I mean
What I'm sayin', what I'm seein' is human beings who I'm seeing
What I'm sayin', who be playin', what I'm sayin', seein' beings
Humans turned into damn machines
And they don't even know what the fuck it means
Y'all can stop it on the three but they can drop it on the one
The P-E-A-C has just begun

"One-one-one, hoo-hah!"

"Yes we can," it's out the can
This mothafuckin' beat is African
I rhyme once a while when the shit is wild
Some people confused
Consumin style
As you grab it
They come to grab us
Now they gots us
I think they shot us
Corporations down to your bone
I ain't no dumb mf on a smart ass phone
I been legit we never quit
Exploded uploaded so yall can spit
Go on and downloaded mixtape
But it mixed and it ain't tape
Dont rhyme for the sake of riddlin
Tweet for the joke of twitterin
My intuition got me trippin position
Humans turned into damn machines
They dont even know what the fk i mean
Yall can stop it on the 3
Y'all can stop it on the three but they can drop it on the one
The P-E-A-C has just begun

MY MIND IS MINE MY GRIND DESIGN
I BEEN THAT AGE THEY AINT BEEN MINE
SO WATCH ME �WORK IT FROM MY �CIRCUIT
AGAINST THEIR PURPOSE
OF KEEPIN TRUTH FROM THE YOUTH
A P.I .CIRCUS
THEY TELL YALL SPEED
IS WHAT YYALL �NEED
MAKE YOU CONSUME
TO GET THE BOOM
NO ANSWERS
NO DANCIN
Y'ALL JUST CONSUME
WHEN THE PARTYS DONE
THEY
JUST TEARIN UP THE ROOM
BOMB THE EARTH TO PIECES
THEY CANT CALM THE WORLD TO PEACE
THE LEASE IS UP IN THIS
THE BELLY OF THIS BEAST
HUMANS TURNED INTO DAMN MACHINES
THEY DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THE FK I MEAN
YALL CAN STOP IT ON THE 3
BUT THEY DROPPED IT ON THE 1
THE P E A C E JUST BEGUNEmbed
