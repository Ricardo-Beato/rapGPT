Zaytoven
Ayy
I'm gonna say a lot of shit with "-ation" on it
You know what I'm sayin'?
A-T-I-O-N, you know what I'm sayin'?
Bang, bang, bang bang, bang
Gang, bang bang

He listened to Chief Keef once and he turned gangster
I'm spinning in this bitch like some turntables
I was fucking on your bitch while you were waiting
While she had your ass waiting like you were a patient
I'm with my black bitch, going to get my Caucasian
Bring that M-16 out for some certain equations
This shit ain't adding up says my fucking calculation
I'm on the road I got that ho doing masturbation

I up this pistol and this bitch start doing evaporation
I'm going fast in my car, my shit stay calibrated
I seen a million dollar lick, you know I had to take it
Blue faces call my phone, you know I had to cake it
I do this shit on my own, fuck your collaborations
I don't need no ID, check my verification
I hear Johnny on the phone, tell him elaborate me
Just to pull up to your party, boy, you gotta pay me
Bitch, you gotta show me something, bitch, immaculate me
What the fuck makes you perfect? Practice, baby
I call up ZayTiggy I ain't beat jacking, baby
I got a hundred dollar each pocket of my jacket, baby
Hopped out on your ho, she said, "You're cappin', baby"
Baby, I ain't a crack baby, I'm a capper, baby
Ho, you can get off my boat, I'm the captain, baby
I treat the bullets like a ship how I sail it, baby

I'm spinning in this bitch like some turntables
I was fucking on your bitch while you were waiting
While she had your ass waiting like you were a patient
I'm with my black bitch, going to get my Caucasian
Bring that M-16 out for some certain equations
This shit ain't adding up says my fucking calculation
I'm on the road I got that ho doing masturbation

The police pull me over and I'm 'toxicated
I'm tryna see what the fuck they determination
They wanna take me out and then incarcerate me
'Cause my car look like a bad ass moderation
Hoes say I ain't easy, it's some complications
I don't do the cuffin', bitch, pick up your desperation
Have my Uber drop you off, what's your destination?
Vegetarian, vegetation, me aspiration
Told the bitch to add it up, can you do multiplications?
I'ma need some mesmerization for my recreation
Every time I hop out it's a celebration
I don't need you or your damn consideration
I ain't shaking hands 'less I like the the negotiation
Ayy, I curse too much, I ain't good at appropriation
To go and pick up the damn cake, that's my damn operation
I'm that nigga, I ain't with the rest of the population
He listened to Chief Keef once and he turned gangster
I'm spinning in this bitch like some turntables
I was fucking on your bitch while you were waiting
While she had your ass waiting like you were a patient
I'm with my black bitch, going to get my Caucasian
Bring that M-16 out for some certain equations
This shit ain't adding up says my fucking calculation
I'm on the road I got that ho doing masturbation1Embed
