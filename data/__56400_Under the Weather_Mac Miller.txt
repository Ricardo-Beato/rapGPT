58 ContributorsUnder the Weather Lyrics
Hey, hey, I bet it must be nice, chillin' every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break
But fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I gotta be goin' in
A part of me wanna chill, but a part of me wanna win
No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel
'Cause haters be lookin' stupid, when you just keepin' it real
I got too much on my mind, to care about the internet bullshit
Or them people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am
Just because they random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin' with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs, I'm tryna get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything'll be okay, like...

How did you know (Know)
I was feelin' so under the weather (Weather)
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
And they say they love you (Love you), but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)

Do you believe in fairy-tales, dreams come true?
One day you gon' make it
If they gave you a handout, and you were down bad
Would you take it?
I found that bein' famous in reality, well, it ain't shit
'Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'ma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'ma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young, they told me to wait until I'm older
They turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for the free
"Hey, Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?"
Bitch, suck my dick

How did you know (Know)
I was feelin' so under the weather (Weather)
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
And they say they love you (Love you), but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright

Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
The hate ain't gonna last forever, so
I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Don't let nobody say you can't
Heart beatin' like a 808

Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright
How did you know (Know)
I was feelin' so under the weather (Weather)
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)
And they say they love you (Love you), but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind (Mind)
Come rest your mind (Mind)
I think it's all gon' be okay (All gon' be okay)14Embed
