Everything that I need and I'll be yours
(I promise, come up)
All the time that I see, give you my word that I be yours

A lot of niggas tryna catch up with that
But they don't seen what I done seen up in these streets
Crack babies and dope house, how many you want
We grew up in the struggle
Now we at the dealership with all our friends
Hollering out how many you want
You electrical and exceptional and inside of you
Is an angel named St. Michael
He say he's in there to protect you and never lie to you
It's so hard to be faithful but you sensitive
And you hold me down so I'mma try for you

Come here
You swearing I be yours
You swearing I be yours (you drink, but you drink and i be)
You drink and I be yours
You drink and I be yours
Let's rock out, you ain't hear what I'm saying
You rock and I be yours
You rock and I be yours
Do that, be everything that I need and I'll be yours (and that's my word I'll be yours)
And you know you willing
My word that I'll be yours
My word that I'll be yours
And you know you feeling
My word that I'll be yours
That's my word
You might also like
Even your friend got my back
She just met me but she feel it
And she gon' see by this time next year
We gon' kill it
Audemars on your wrist that just something for today
Driving Rolls for the week and a Rari for the skeet
Got that condo for the month
You get massages for an hour
Red lipstick on my body print
I can smell you seducing, I promise, come up

Come here
You swearing I be yours
You swearing I be yours (you drink, but you drink and i be)
You drink and I be yours
You drink and I be yours
Let's rock out, you ain't hear what I'm saying
You rock and I be yours
You rock and I be yours
Do that, be everything that I need and I'll be yours (and that's my word I'll be yours)
And you know you willing
My word that I'll be yours
My word that I'll be yours
And you know you feeling
My word that I'll be yours
That's my word
That's my word13Embed
