28 ContributorsNever Did Coke Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, SAV killed it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Right this way, right this way)
Yeah, I got this nigga on this Detroit shit, man (Go on, take your seats, take your seats, go on, take your seats)
When am I gonna start the show? Hah

My allergies fuckin' up but my bitches ain't
I just bought a crib, next to mine, and bought a shark tank
I just turned the clear colored pop to dark pink (Wock')
I might turn the top of my crib to a skatin' rink (Ooh)
I might break a bitch and her friends for double Cs (Yes)
Rap niggas been gettin' money, but not like me
I rolled up in six black Benzes like Eazy-E (Ew)
Bitches always sleazy 'cause they nosy, get out my B
Said I'm in love with many bitches, but not like Rih'
Niggas hate we gettin' riches, they can suck my D
11:11, come make your wishes, me and Swae top three
And we not three
Bitch said I'm livin' like a wizard, this ain't D.C
I hate catfishin', I wanna fuck what I saw on IG
I told this bitch, "We're just friends," it's like Biz Markie (Damn)
Woulda thought I had a nose ring 'cause all eyes is on me

I ain't even pressed
I already fucked, put the Ms in the chest
I'm already up
My big bros be psychos, they already nuts (Nuts)
There's plenty love to go around, all the money get touched (Touched)
I'm a first-class nigga, I can't settle for less (Less)
Fucked her friends off a, "Hello," as soon as we met (Ayy)
I ain't dogged the bitch out 'cause she wasn't the type (Type)
But I had to tell, "I already found the love of my life" (Never)
Empty out a bag like I normally do (I do)
I could put you in the clip like I'm makin' a movie (Damn)
I'm so stiff on the bitch, had to call a masseuse
Teacher always hated me 'cause I was breakin' the rules (Ooh)
That's a jump ball, she gon' fuck me on the spot
She turn your phone off, your nigga in his PJs, I'm a robot
Put a chip in his brain, I'm a big dawg
When I flex, I got gains (Trap, trap)
You might also like
You got Benzes, I got Benzes, but it ain't the same
'Bout a two hunnid thousand dollar difference, we in different lanes (Skrrt)
Me and my niggas fuck on bitches when we feel pain (Yeah)
We don't pop pills when we hurt, you niggas lame (Pussy, hahaha)
You niggas weird (Pussy)
Promise anything happened that night, I wasn't there
Anything that don't involve my money, I never care
Tryna grow a whole carat garden in both my ears
My bitch got my name engraved in both my spears (What?)
Looked at her kinda crazy, she must think I'm hunting some deer
Everything that come out his mouth fake, he must have veneers
You ain't been the same since you lost your boss just like the Cavaliers
(Go) I'm a real problem
Can't be solved, just like world hunger, get them boys off 'em
Fucked his bitch, put my pants on backwards, had to Kris Kross 'em
We get it though, one shot to the throat, he better play possum (Boom)
These niggas know us
Niggas not tough, puttin' on a damn act, you a store runner
I'm a ho hunter, I ain't no goon, I got real shooters
Real rims and real Hoovers that don't play on computers

I been doin' this rap shit so long, I might retire (Might retire)
Wrappin' up this shit like I'm tired (Like I'm tired)
Hunnid thousand dollar watch from different suppliers
Niggas goin' through what they gotta do just to provide
Ask about me, any city, they say I'm that guy (That guy)
I did county, any Euros, I'm worldwide (Worldwide)
Top of that buildin', smokin' certified (Certified)
I didn't put a baby in that bitch but I fertilized
Diamonds underwater (Ooh), I just had to let 'em soak (Soak)
I'm like E-40, man, just tell me when to go (Go)
Security had the shotty, he ain't even need the scope (Scope)
Pourin' out the drank, never once did the drugs or coke1Embed
