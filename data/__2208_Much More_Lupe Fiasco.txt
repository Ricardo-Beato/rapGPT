21 ContributorsMuch More Lyrics
I gave you honesty on my first joint
And y'all all came out
I showed you what change 'bout
Unroll your blunts, pour your champagne out
Dullers of the pain, so you can plainly see
The black man pain I campaign 'bout
God willing 'fore I wane, I take a champion route
Before I throw a bout: I'll walk out the game
While my fans in the stands is chanting my name out, Lupe
Uh, and it's going to be PPV, won't be back for free
Gone need scratch to see me rematch with me
My greatest enemy, is my inner me
So I take this urge and give you Revenge of the Nerd: Fahrenheit 1-15, uh
Yeah, and you know I fight the feeling
Box so I can shop, sometime it doesn't register
So I return to the ring, like Return of the King
With the habit of a hobbit it makes it hard to drop it
I'm a klepto stealing
And it gets the best
Just when I guess that I left those leanings
I be back on post in a trench coat scheming

Much is more what we got in store
Just believe me, (than they can ever see)
Much more than they can see
Is how it'll always be, believe me
You might also like
Uh, yeah, uh
So I get back into my stance, revert to my dance
With a shirt full of pants
And my accomplice got a purse full of pants
A pocket full of purses, with no intent to purchase in the plans
And we rehearsed it 'til it's perfect
Just to dodge the searchers of the man
Just to surface outside, then return of all the merch to stay
In the service of the perfect understand, uh, yeah
And I boost myself
So from the coal car to the caboose I'm felt
From the rear to the engineer
From the L to the Underground Railroad
From the redline to the TGV
A champion fighter for whom the bell tolls, L-U-P
Little engine from the hood, the hustler in me
Known to hit the track like John Henry
Just give me my glasses
My eight ounce Everlastes' and a Michael Buffer entry
Shoplifter, tag switcher
That's me, nigga I'm back with ya, uh

Championship is here, yeah
F&F is here
1st & 15 is here
Madison street, we back in here
Chi-town is here
Lupe Fiasco
Fahrenheit 1/15
Revenge of the Nerds
Part II
Can we bring the hook back
Bring my girl Yummy back
Know what I'm saying, let 'em know that we still rolling
Know what I'm talking 'bout
