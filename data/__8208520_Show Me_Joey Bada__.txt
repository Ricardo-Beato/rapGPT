Show me how
You care
(Statik Selektah, yeah)
Tell me how (Tell me all)
You loved (Tell me how you love, baby)
Before (Uh)

Can't spell "us" without "trust"
Put the lust aside, there's some things we gotta discuss
So close your legs for a bit, baby, let's open up
Closed mouths don't get fed finishing lunch, her panties in a bunch
Tell me where you been at these last couple months
You say you want me back, so baby, don't front
'Cause I could never know too much but just enough
So the next nigga never feel he got the one-up
But we ain't gotta rush, take your time
We could talk until the sun up, I see you tryin'
To say what's on your mind, I promise to be fine
I could see the signs, be honest, I ain't blind
The truth is we all got our own desires, our own dreams
It's a big world, gotta try new things

So right here, right now, what you gotta say
You ain't gotta lie now, it's the bed we made
You might also like
Show me how (Show me how, baby)
You care (Right here, right now)
Right here, right now, right now, baby, yeah
Tell me how (Tell me all)
You loved (Tell me how you love, baby)
Before (Uh)

'Cause transparency my love language
Can't see the bigger picture if your vision tangled
Love is like glass, either break it or you stain it
These late-night conversations turn into arraignments, just tell me the truth
'Cause I ain't tryna judge, baby, I just want you to be you
'Cause I'ma be me, keep it G like real niggas do
'Cause you knew a nigga way before he got famous on the block, nameless
And I'm proud to say the money never changed us
We've been through many phases like mazes, still we found a way
I never knew a love that wasn't painless
Pouring out my heart was always draining, I gotta say
Now every day, it's indigo rain, and yeah, this a brighter day
A lifetime I provide for you, by the way
Don't you forget that I would die for you any day

Right here, right now, what you gotta say?
You ain't gotta lie now, it's the bed we made, uh
Show me how (Show me how, baby)
You care (Right here, right now)
Right here, right now, right now, baby, yeah
Tell me how (Tell me all)
You loved (Tell me how you loved, baby)
Before

You ain't gotta lie to me, no-no
I know you would die for me, it's for sure
Baby girl, this life we live is too short
Baby girl, this life we live is too short
You ain't gotta lie to me, no-no
I know you would die for me, it's for sure
Baby girl, this life we live is too short
Yeah, too- it's too short (Too short)

Said a thug don't cry, no
But a thug don't cry, no, and real niggas don't lie
Said a thug don't cry, no
Said, a thug don't cry, no, and real niggas don't lie
Said a thug don't cry, no
And the thug don't cry, no, and real niggas don't lie
Said a thug don't cry, no
Thug don't cry, real niggas never lie2Embed
