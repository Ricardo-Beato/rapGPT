4 ContributorsTake The Money And Run Lyrics
Let me tell you bout what I love in Gina
Love is like no other couldn't get in between her
Always stayed fly man I wished that you seen her
Said they had a scheme but nobody believed her
No real job cause she stay in the streets
Gina did nails but her love made beats
When they wanna eat they just walked in the store
They took what they wanted man the illest you saw
Til one day they went up kindin fiendin with ice
Butter like(?) the jeans and Gina said "The rings are nice"
Next thing you know they wanna pull off a heist
Shook took a look and shot the jeweler twice
Diamonds all shinin as they flew in the air
Butter actin up and grabbin stuff by the pair
Gina at the door cause she good with the gun
They both grabbed the money and run

C'mon, take the money and run {*v/ scratched: "Run"*}
C'mon, take the money and run {*v/ scratched: "Run"*} hey, hey, hey
C'mon, take the money and run {*v/ scratched: "Run"*}
C'mon, take the money and run {*v/ scratched: "Run.."*} hey, hey, hey

Spoonie was a rookie that was new on the scene
Used to be a thug now he's doin it clean
Ironic he was coppin and they gave him the spot
Knew Butter back from Hollis used to chill on the block
Seen Butter round the way with a brand new Benz
Gina lookin pretty in the city with friends
Spoonie's sayin yo I gotta get these ends
And these are the two I gotta apprehend
A big boy from Hollis promised not to tell
And lead these cops on a long long trail
Spoonie saw Gina and the chick turned pale
Runnin sayin somethin like she don't got bail
Butter said promise me I won't see jail
Spoonie want a watch and a brand new cell
Butter and Gina moved to Pensacola
Spoonie got a Roley and a Motorola

All I can say is about the story
Is livin like Butter Love is not for me
Let me show you how we get the money legit
Jack B. Nimble was nimble, and he was quick
Rev. Run, D.M.C. is the +Kings of Rock+
Rolled to the top and then we never did drop
You still here to jam me in two thousand and one
Then me and D'll take the money and run

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey - that's what I sayEmbed
