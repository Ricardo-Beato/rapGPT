19 ContributorsAsk Dem Hoes Lyrics
Yeah, buddy
Weezy F. Baby, baby! Hahahahaha
Yeah, my type of shit
See—
When I do what I do, I do it
I said—
"When I do what I do, I do it"
That right
Haha

See, she all on my dick 'cause I make a lot of money
But I don't know why, 'cause she gets none— bring it back
—all on my dick 'cause I make a lot of money
But I dunno why 'cause she gets none from me
She only get dick way down in her tummy
And she tell all of her friends; now, her friends wanna— bring it back
—only get dick way down in her tummy
And she tell all of her friends; now, her friends wanna fuck me
I'm looking in the mirror, and I see a dollar sign
I had a CAT scan, and I had money on my mind
I tell a bitch, "Go and get my name on your spine
So I can feel good when I'm hitting it from behind"
I'm crack rock-fresh, baby, I'm that boy
Now, put me in a pot, and watch, I come back hard
Yeah, put me on the block, and watch: I come back rich
Now she done put me in that pussy, she ain't come back since, ha!

Hat to the side, rims on the ride
It can't fit in my pocket, and I don't have to— hold up
Hat to the side, rims on the ride
It can't fit in my pocket, and I don't have to cock it
Scarface, bitch: Cocaine by the pie
Got them hoes sniffing like them hoes 'bout to— hold up
Scarface, bitch: Cocaine by the pie
Got them hoes sniffing like them hoes 'bout to cry
Ms. MySpace, don't blow my high
I download hard dick to your hard drive
Then, she got on her knees; that's when we locked eyes
She caught it like it was a routine pop fly
I'm dopeboy fresh: New jeans, new everything
Them bitches want me like a wedding ring
I told her that I'm married to the money, committed to the cash
All I see is pussy, titties, and a ass
Ask dem hoes
Yeah, ask dem hoes; ask dem hoes about me
Ask dem hoes
Mhm, yeah, ask dem hoes; ask dem hoes about me

Bitch, I'm a beast (Ask dem hoes), ho, I'm a dog (Ask dem hoes, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a beast (Ask dem hoes), ho, I'm a dog (Ask dem hoes about me)

Call me "Weezy F.," bitch, I'm straight from the street
The dope game is sour, and the dope is sweet
I live in the towers, got a scope on the heat
Hit you from a hunnid feet—we don't even have to meet
Your bitch love me—we don't even have to meet
But if I run into her, believe me, I will— hold on
Your bitch love me—we don't even have to meet
But if I run into her, believe me, I will do her
And if that bitch is crazy, believe me, I will sue her
Got some hungry-ass lawyers that will eat her up and chew her
I don't know how you love her; I wish I never knew her
She only gave me brain—she was just another tutor
She blew my whole band—I was just another tuba
Now get off my dick, and get lost in Aruba
It's money over bitches, Cash Money over bitches
Young Money over bitches, get money from them bitches—I do!
Ask dem hoes
Yeah, ask dem hoes; ask dem hoes about me
Ask dem hoes
Mhm, yeah, ask dem hoes; ask dem hoes about me
I'm a beast (Ask dem hoes), I'm a dog (Ask dem hoes)
I'm a beast (Ask dem hoes), I'm a dog (Ask dem hoes)
Bitch, I'm a beast (Ask dem hoes), ho, I'm a dog (Ask dem hoes, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a beast (Ask dem hoes), ho, I'm a dog (Ask dem hoes about me)17Embed
