12 ContributorsHead Lyrics
I know you had a long day
Ran a bath with the Calgon and take you away
You know I can't cook, so I made a bowl of soup
Rub your feet on the futon and TIVO soup's
I know sometimes you feel alone
Like you against the world tryna make it on your own
So let me take away that stress
Just escape for the moment and let your problems rest
I mean I'll really pay attention
Tell me 'bout that bitch you hate, and this time I really listen
Cause today's 'bout you
Wanna see that pretty smile, so what you wanna do?
Go to the movies, plan next day shopping?
Play Maxwell 'till the cops come knockin'?
And we still won't stop
You got my head goin', that's why I give it, don't stop

I can't get you outta my mind, so
Come with me and just spend some time
I can't get you outta my head
Say I can't get you outta my head
Get you outta my head...
Say I can't get you outta my mind, so
Come with me and just spend some time
I can't get you outta my head
Say I can't get you outta my head
Get you outta my head...
You might also like
I know that life can be a bitch
Let's plan a vacation, take a far trip
Take you out the D, away from all the city fumes
Leave your job behind, don't even worry 'bout school
We can spend the night on the beach
Playin' in the sand, watchin' waves, 'till we sleep
Wake up in the morning, eat breakfast on the rooftop
94 degrees, have you sweatin' in your tube top
And let the problems come back
You got my head goin', that's why I keep coming back
Waist so little, but that ass so fat
Gotta nigga gone girl, now how you do that?
I know this world can get you down
So when you feeling bothered girl, call on Brown
Even doe I'm chasin' this bread
I can't get you outta my head
