20 ContributorsDavid Banner (Iâ€™m A Rocker) Lyrics
Chrome on the monster
Leather intestines
With a top model
And the contestants
I'm a Rottweiler
Yes I'm a rock 'n' roller
It's Weezy Fuckin' Baby
Yeah straight up out the stroller

Chrome on the monster
Leather intestines
With a top model
And the contestants
I'm a Rottweiler
Yes I'm a rock-n-roller
It's Weezy Fuckin' Baby
Yeah straight up out the stroller
I'm higher than the solar
System
Marley twist 'em
I'm like Macaulay Culkin
I was rich when I was pissin'
On myself, I'm ballin'
You niggas haterholics
I'm just the recipe
So you can save the garlic
I'm like a set of keys
I'm bout to get it started
I smoke them Beverly
Hills, from California
Them bitches after me
So I put that paddle on 'em
She rode my dick
And said she shoulda put a saddle on him
I watch out for them snakes
Listen for that rattle, homie
And I ain't got a clique
I got a cattle, homie
What up Five
Kickin' back just being boo
I'm talking foreign money
Like a European dude
Yeah I'm heavy, man
So you should reconsider
I hit you one time
Fuck up your equilibrium
I got rhythm
Yeah, I got soul y'all
I travel all around the world like a postcard
My flow cold
Fuck around and get a cold sore
I got this bitch on lock like a closed door
Weezy's real, them other niggas folklore
I'm connected, I got more hoods than a coat store
I'm successful, I got more shit than you can hope for
And I got through that water like a boat oar
Young, Carter the name
Baby boy rising like hot water and 'caine

Whip it, stretch it, and flip it
Re-up, stretch it and flip it
Re-up, stretch it and flip it
Re-up, stretch it and flip it

Re-up
We up in the club, we up in the club
Money running like water, bitch get up in the tub
I'm up in the club, she up in the club, he up in the club
Now she can't leave so we fuck in the club
Am I lucky or what
Playboy rabbit
And I like big tongues, like skateboard fashion
I got more girls than the Playboy mansion
I bet I serve 'em up like my name Pete Sampras
And a nigga drink like the late Fred Sandford
And a nigga smoke like there is no cancer
And I know this world is so cold and deceivin'
But I keep my head up like my nose is bleedin'
Yeah, and until that chosen evenin'
I'mma be screaming Apple and Eagle
Yeah, that's right, Apple and Eagle
Hollygrove 17, I won't leave you
Nope, and this is just the preview
But I am already working on the sequel
Fuck with me wrong
I'll fuck with your home
Like a letter to the wife saying your husband is gone
Like Muslim I'm calm
But like Muslim I'll bomb
And beat the track up like a hundred arms
I'm funky like underarms
The engineer's recording a thunderstorm
My hunger forms
Then ring the alarms
Tha Carter 2 was nice
But the third times a charm
Weezy Fuckin'10Embed
