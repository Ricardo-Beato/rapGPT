12 ContributorsA Letter To The New York Post Lyrics
Yo, G! Come and get your New York Post!
New York Post, right here! Come on, y'all!
Get the boast-a, boast-a, boast-a
Coast-a, coast-a, New York Post-a

Yo, New York Post, don't brag and boast
Dissin' Flavor when he's butter that you put on your toast
Put my address in the paper 'cause I smacked that girl
She's the mother of my kids I took around the world
Disagreements having scuffles when you share upon
You shouldn't try to drain subjects in a duck pond
If you're gonna tell a story about people's worries
Watch what you tell 'em cause they don't bring you glory
It only brings agony, ask James Cagney
He beat up on a guy when he found he was a fagney
Cagney is a favorite he is my boy
He don't jive around, he's a real McCoy

Yeah, you tellin' Flav, we got to let 'em know
Here's a letter to the New York Post
The worst piece of paper on the East coast
Matter of fact, the whole state
Forty cents in New York City, fifty cents elsewhere
And makes no goddamn sense at all
America's oldest continuously published daily piece of bullshit
You might also like
Flavor Flav is the one that makes the Post money
Writers making violence in headlines funny
Tryin' to undress my past until it's naked
Post got Flavor from sellin' no records
Europe Asia to the streets of New York
Flavor Flav known for his finesse talk
Do it to ya for the Post to employ me
New York Post can't destroy me
Rapper of Public Enemy, rap star beats lover
With the headline of a fucked up cover
Out the pot took the plate, New York Post
Get your story straight motherfucker

It always seems they make our neighborhood look bad
Here's a letter to the New York Post
Ain't worth the paper it's printed on
Founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton
That is a hundred-ninety years continuous of fucked up news
Yo, one can play the game, two can play the game
Yo Flav, read on

Can't forget you either, Jet
Flavor Flav is your best jet yet
My own people own the most business
Write on faith of value-isness
Should have checked with me before you wrote it
Got it from another source and quote it
Put it out like the New Year ball drop
In every beauty parlor and barber shop
Flavor Flav world renown
Can't keep a man like Flavor down
Yo Jet, be a good host
Don't print bull like the New York Post
Ah, looks like somebody slipped up here
Anyway, here's a letter to the New York Post
Black newspaper and magazines are supposed to get the real deal from the source y'all
Sorry, Jet you took the info straight out of the Post
Burned us  like toast
When it comes to getting you facts straight about the PE
Get your shit correctEmbed
