6 ContributorsSimply The Best Lyrics
Woah, woah, watch what you doing, sir, watch the gates, man
Oh my bad, my bad
This is Armani, right here
This is tailormade, man, this ain't that Jamaica Avenue shit (hardly, hardly)
You know? Hand me my cup flakes

I'm simply the best, I got a beam with the stuff
I take dimes up off the math, and put a million in his smile
Let's talk money, move when the beast come out
My nigga, I'm what the East about (50 Cent)
All these serious radios stock three dollars and shit
Now it's up the nine, yeah, nigga, yeah
I make a mill' here, blow a mill' there
Prolly with exec's doing lunch in the lair
Y'all niggas get to stay in the hood, I'on care (damn)
I'm out in Beverly Hills, I'm cool right here
I'm still single 'til I find the baddest bitch in the planet
Jay got Beyonce, JD got Janet
Everything you see going down, nigga, I plan it
I'd explain it to you homie, but you wouldn't understand it
It's the king, 50, grrah

Yeah, it's the union, haha
Grrah, it's PI, deal on the West, Spider Loc, what up nigga? Haha (Jay Built, that biz'!)
