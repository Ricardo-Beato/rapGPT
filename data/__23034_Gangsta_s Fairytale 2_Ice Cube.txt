Pay attention
Pay attention
Pay attention
Pay attention
Hey motherfuckin' Cube, what the fuck's wrong with you?
You didn't kick the rest of that Gangsta Fairytale shit
Why don't you kick it one good time?
Niggas on the playground wanna know what's happenin'
You left 'em hangin', man, what the fuck?

Little Boy Blue is outta Folsom
Now them three little pigs gotta roast him
Driving down Sesame Street and I bet
That little motherfucker's out fucking Smurfette
Ain't saw the wolf yet, but it's no doubt
They'll catch his ass slipping at his grandma house
They got the MAC-10 pointed out the coupe
'Cause they gotta follow they nose like Fruit Loops
Peeped out Little Miss Muffet on her tuffet eating grits
She saw the MAC-10 and the bitch had the shits
Ran into her house, called up her crew
'Cause Red Riding Hood wants to kill Little Boy Blue
And the wolf too, what is Mister Rogers doing?
Moved out his Jordan, bought him a Ewing
Him, Little Boy Blue and the wolf in the cellar
Planning on getting Cinderella
'Cause Cinderella still works for the pigs
Through with the dwarfs, fucking Bebe's kids
Now Snow White got the horny-ass beaver
Fucking the Beauty's Beast like Jungle Fever
Now the word's on the street
When the crews meet, you better make some fucking room
'Cause it's on with the pigs and them other nigs
When the cow jump over the moon, everybody jump
You might also like
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Everybody)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

Now Little Boy Blue is up front
With the nine millimeter, ready for the hunt
Little Red Riding Hood caught his ass slipping
Drew down on the boy 'cause the bitch is set tripping
About to get loose with the deuce-deuce
That's when the boy said, "What about the gang truce?"
The little ho had no words
The wolf came around and the bitch got served
Three little pigs bought wigs
Dressed like sheep, Cinderella is Little Bo Peep
Trying to creep on the crew
The wolf, the Rogers, the Blue, they through
'Cause the pigs did the buck-buck-bang-ping
Now you hear the fat lady sing
Cinderella ran like a bitch
To the pay phone 'cause the bitch is still a snitch
Now the pigs are caught by the pigs and taken
In the pen to get fried like bacon
You still can't trust no ho
And Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go
Yeah Cube, man that shit was dope, nigga
You all that and a bowl of grits, nigga, that shit was on props, nigga
Yeah, that's how you kick that shit for the ninety-deuce, nigga
What's happening, nigga?
Yeah, nigga, that's Gangsta Fairytale part 2 nigga
Y'all trick-ass niggas can't fuck with it4Embed
