21 ContributorsOUT FRONT Lyrics
Please let me know
What type of voodoo magic trick I gotta do
In order to see you before I leave this state
Just let me know what's the procedure
To book an appointment with you

I know that you been waitin' on me, I'm out front
I know you sick of playin' these games, I'm 'bout done
I can turn this shit up a couple of thousand
Your man saying somethin', but he ain't about nothin'
'Bout nothin', 'bout nothin'
Mmm, how come?
Don't talk like that when you know the outcome
She been waitin' 'til I drop, let her play the album

Outdone, he been outdone
Lot of girls back home, but I'm thinkin' 'bout one
Made rounds in my phone, but I'm leavin' out someone
Ayy, someone (Ayy, check it)
I-71 to Cane Run, I didn't wanna say nothin'
But I just think that (I just... ooh)
This ain't what you want, girl
Can't front, girl, I can't just be with one girl
Especially when you know how pussy runs the world
And it's runnin' through my mind like woah
Through my mind like (Ayy, ooh)
You might also like
I know that you been waitin' on me, I'm out front
I know you sick of playin' these games, I'm 'bout done
I can turn this shit up a couple of thousand
Your man saying somethin', but he ain't about nothin'
'Bout nothin', 'bout nothin'
Mmm, how come?
Don't talk like that when you know the outcome
She been waitin' 'til I drop, let her play the album

Gon' play that shit, mm-mm
Gon' play that shit
I was thinkin' 'bout you when I made that shit
Okay, me and that girl got the same accent
'Cause she's a hometown baby
Could you put your phone down, maybe?
You been showin' out lately
She just want to spend a little quality time (Time)
I-65 on a late-night drive
And I'm goin' 'bout eighty (Goin' 'bout eighty)
Maybe I been goin' 'bout it all wrong
Sometimes I just need someone to call on
What I'm gon' do when they all gone?

I know that you been waitin' on me, I'm out front
I know you sick of playin' these games, I'm 'bout done
I can turn this shit up a couple of thousand
Your man saying somethin', but he ain't about nothin'
'Bout nothin', 'bout nothin'
Mmm, how come?
Don't talk like that when you know the outcome
She been waitin' 'til I drop, let her play the album
Gon' play that shit (Mm-mm)
Gon' play that shit
I was thinkin' 'bout you when I made that shit
I was thinkin' 'bout, girl...Embed
