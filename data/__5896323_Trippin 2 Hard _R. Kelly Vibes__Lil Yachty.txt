9 ContributorsTrippin 2 Hard (R. Kelly Vibes) Lyrics
Yo, its me
Uh, why won't you answer any of my calls?
Are you, like, dead or something? The fuck, like
It's been days now, fucking days
It's been embarrassing for me, too bad

Damn, I don’t know what’s wrong with me
I be tripping too hard
Playin' with your heart like a Nintendo
Actin' like I never been here before
Know that you’re good for me but I act like you not
Still might fuck on a thot
Ridin' round in a new drop, getting that top, from a lil' bop
Why we can’t do what we do on the low?
Why you gotta cuff me like a cop? Tryna make me your man?
Tell the whole world our plans
Fuck with you hard but don’t tell me what I can’t do
Baby girl trust me I can put a girl right in her place

Got a bitch stuck like Xans
I’m a ain’t shit nigga made at least 8 figures
Ain’t arguing over no bitch, especially not with no man
Who can’t do half what I can
Look at my life, big house, no wife, twenty-two, no kids, my plans
Gonna go on forever, I’m never going broke I promise
Sign the paper, I play for them bucks, I’m feeling just like Giannis
I'ma just let you go ‘fore I play with your heart
That’s on my conscience
And I promise I’m conscious to what’s going on
Rather be single I could just get my ho-ing on
You might also like
Damn, I don’t know what’s wrong with me (Uh-huh)
I be tripping too hard (Too hard)
Playin' with your heart like a Nintendo (Yeah)
Actin' like I never been here before (Yeah)
Know that you’re good for me but I act like you not (Yeah)
Still might fuck on a thot (A thot)
Ridin' round in a new drop, getting that top, from a lil' bop (Bop)
Why we can’t do what we do on the low?
Why you gotta cuff me like a cop? (Why?)
Tryna make me your man? (Uh)
Tell the whole world our plans (Yeah)
Fuck with you hard but don’t tell me what I can’t do
Baby girl, trust me I can put a girl right in her place

Finna start preaching like Ma$e
Dirty ass ho too slow tryna get a nigga mad tryna fuck at his place
Yellin' all in my face, that shit that disgrace
No cap, I'm tryna fuck to NAV, I'm tryna fuck then dip
Get that shit wet like a shiv, ain't gotta tell no one, baby
When we on I promise so let me put this on 'ya lip
Let me put dick on 'ya lip, I'm tryna fuck on 'ya lip
Damn, okay, hold that shit down, you gon' get a crown, yeah

Damn, I don’t know what’s wrong with me (Uh-huh)
I be tripping too hard (Too hard)
Playin' with your heart like a Nintendo (Yeah)
Actin' like I never been here before (Yeah)
Know that you’re good for me but I act like you not (Yeah)
Still might fuck on a thot (A thot)
Ridin' round in a new drop, getting that top, from a lil' bop (Bop)
Why we can’t do what we do on the low?
Why you gotta cuff me like a cop? (Why?)
Tryna make me your man? (Uh)
Tell the whole world our plans (Yeah)
Fuck with you hard but don’t tell me what I can’t do
Baby girl, trust me I can put a girl right in her placeEmbed
