10 ContributorsLife is Real Lyrics
Boogie man, boogie man, boogie man
BOOGIE MAN! (Hello children!)
My whole life is real
My life {*4X*}
A-ha, Brooklyn you know
My life, my life, my life, my life
It's a real thang

Listen
My whole life is real, morning news and nights is real
What I spit and I write is real, cuz my life is real
My own life is ill!
Filled with magic's strife to scale
Sun bright, no time to chill, got all type of bills
I got seeds I gotta feed with this
They be needin shit, I got ex-wife beef and shit
That's how deep it get
My whole life is real, my whole life is ill
A fantastic, a beautiful mess
And life nigga in America: the usual stress
I do it to the up, low, the east and the west, I
Do it to most, I do it to death
I do so it good they don't know what to do with theyselves
Well do this: MOVE!
Back, forward, mo'
Life is real, let's move on
You might also like
My whole life is real, morning news and nights is real
What I spit and I write is real, cuz my life is ILL
Filled with magic's strife to scale
Sun bright, no time to chill
Got all type of bills
I got seeds I gotta feed with this
I got streets I gotta reach with this
That's how deep it get

My whole life is ill, my whole life is real
Mornings, noon's, nights
Birthdays, workdays, holidays, funerals. the usual
Life is real!
Sunday to Monday, school, your gunplay, politics, bullshit
Life is real!
Shootings, stabbing, free tray, arrest
Crush, kill, destroy, cheques
Death. rebirth
Reach the world but touch the street first
Life goin in every direction but rewind
Niggas is waiting for the light to dive down
On a park a hustler plays the hide out
Somebody's gotta notice it's a matter of time before the world fine out
The earth dry out and push the hintin to high ground,life style--Hostile
Real, life real real
So real, too real, news real--edited
The close up block out the rest of it
True evident, false measurement
Crunk superstar, thug president
Tricks allegiance, M-def payment ship
Scribe lively, so timely,that is timeless
And is lovely, and is ugly, as it must be

My whole life is real, ha-haa!
Brooklyn know
My life my, My life my, My life my, My life my
B.X. know
My life my (*4X*}
Real niggas all over the world
My life my {*4X*), it's a real thang
Whoooo!
Boogie man!1Embed
