9 ContributorsBigger Picture Lyrics
It ain't all about the ice, all the nights a nigga sacrificed, yeah
It ain't all about these hoes, I know how it feel to go broke, yeah
It ain't all about the cars, I grind and I grind hard, yeah
It ain't all about these clothes, my nigga dead, God bless his soul, yeah

Ever since my grand daddy died (what), I ain't been da same nigga (nope)
And sickle cell (where) all inside my lil sister
I'm fucked up inside, put more lean inside my system
Every day I tell God I wish Snoop was still living
I ain't forgot about ya nigga, Free band gang winning
I do shit for Lonzo, a junkee stabbed my nigga
That could of been me serving, you don't know the half my nigga
The weight I'm dealing with, I just might start killing shit
I hit the studio vibing, spitting the realest shit
I shouldve seen a psychiatrist, I was built for this
On the road of riches ain't about a bitch
No DVS's, no wink & kiss, paid dues are overdue
This shit ain't bout my neck or wrist, real shit (true story)

It ain't all about the ice, all the nights a nigga sacrificed, yeah
It ain't all about these hoes, I know how it feel to go broke, yeah
It ain't all about the cars, I grind and I grind hard, yeah
It ain't all about these clothes, my nigga dead, God bless his soul, yeah
You might also like
It ain't all about the glitter and the gleam it ain't what it seem, yeah
But I'm grinding like a blender, I'm a whip it 'til I get that cream, yeah
I keep it G who keep it G with me, I fuck with who gone fuck with me, yeah
It ain't all about these bitches, death to you snitches, I'll die by these riches, yeah
I'm on a countership with Ceelo
Rest in peace to Prime
And free my nigga Auto, yeah
You niggas wanna be Lo, but you can never be Lo, 'cause you can never see Lo, yeah

It ain't all about the ice, all the nights a nigga sacrificed, yeah
It ain't all about these hoes, I know how it feel to go broke, yeah
It ain't all about the cars, I grind and I grind hard, yeah
It ain't all about these clothes, my nigga dead, God bless his soul, yeah

Thousand dollar shots on my face, I'm coolin' it
I rock the gold, keeping it basic it ain't bout the gliss
I want the type of check I can make my niggas rich
Alot of people talk that loyalty don't know what it is
Have you ever been so broke you don't even wanna live?
So fucked up to the point that funerals can share the tears
Gotta grind so fucking hard the shit bring you to tears
Forgot to call my momma on her birthday God bless the kid
Phone barely ringing now it's ringing till it's dead
I'm bout to run dem m's up mutha fuck the feds
Got my money in a wall, ain't fucking up my bread
I had a talk with the Most High and this is what He said
It ain't all about the ice, all the nights a nigga sacrificed, yeah
It ain't all about these hoes, I know how it feel to go broke, yeah
It ain't all about the cars, I grind and I grind hard, yeah
It ain't all about these clothes, my nigga dead, God bless his soul, yeah2Embed
