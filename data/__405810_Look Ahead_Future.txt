Be bold
You smell me
Lil Mexico

While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go

Was it cold nights that made me cold
Do the stress increase my hunger
Tell a lie then make a promise
Fish like a man nigga, fish, hit nigga this a fucking hit
Send a nigga home full clip, traumatized by the whole trip
Boatload full of cocaina
Got some wolves 'round and some hyenas
Bought a AK like this bitch a nina
And I know I got a billionaire demeanor (Future!)
Pourin' up the Dom Perignon
Fuck a pussy, nigga, fuck a pussy 'til it's numb
Put the pussy on a nigga tongue
'Til the pussy juice runnin' down my lungs
Ain't another better feelin'
Like the feeling when a nigga make it out the slums
Stackin' all my racks on racks
I got my niggas rich, I'm at the top where I belong
You might also like
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go

Dressed up in all black leather
Bodybag .38 special
Ainâ€™t a bad bitch a nigga treasure
Need money on a whole 'nother level
Good time, nigga good time
Barrel longer than a guitar
Never sacrifice who you are
Then you turn yourself into a star
Turn myself into a avatar (Future!)
Put the OG in my 'gar
Take a penitentiary chance
That's a change, eat shrimp, steak, caviar
Bloodline is a lion
Fly nigga
Walk and say when I walk, it look like a nigga flyin'
Fuck your lies and your bullshit you tryna sell me cause I ain't buyin'
Green minded like a slave field, niggas picking green like it's cotton
Money getting' burnt, money fire
Franck Muller or the new Chopard
Frank mattress nigga Frank Lucas
Real life on wax
Not your ordinary film or movie
Phenomenon when the commas come
Kill the winter and then when the summer comes
Ex con, 100 rountad drum...Batman the paint James Bond
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
While they laugh and shake their head
Still we coming in
Now the people know where we go, go, go
We go, go, go
