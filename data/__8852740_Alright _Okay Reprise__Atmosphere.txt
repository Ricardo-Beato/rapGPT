Okay, I think I'm feeling alright
It'll be all good, even if it's worse than it looks
Stay aware of where you put your best foot
It's gonna be all good
Alright, okay
It'll be just fine, even if there ain't enough time
I was alive, I was a piece of the design
It's gonna be just fine
Alright, okay
It'll be alright, even if it still feel like
The world might not live through the night
It's gonna be alright
Alright
It'll be okay, even if you're feeling like there ain't no way
You're still with us today it'll be okay
