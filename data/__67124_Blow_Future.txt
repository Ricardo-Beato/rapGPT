Blow that money like a candle, blow
Blow that kush like a candle, blow
Blow that money like a candle, blow
Blow that kush like a candle, blow

I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it
40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
What I spent today I spent it in a month I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!

What a bird go foe, I got that in my coat, say 35 racks?
I can buy a kilo, put a gucci skully on
Help me think a lil better
I stuff the cash in my denim
Blowin racks on bezels
All the drugs I made, I need a gold medal
All the songs I played,blow the mill look better
I blow the strongest dope I drink the strongest lean when I hit the scene you see racks in jeans
Think I printed it up like a copy machine ya'll niggas fugazy, tryna copy muh team
I blow dem bands like ceiling fans
Stay chasin' paper, like a Taliban
I'm freeband, La Familia
I got Benjamins, talkin a bunch of them
You might also like
I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it
40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
What I spent today I spent it in a month I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!

Just bought a 458
Cost three hundred racks
Ludacris I'm a legend
So still drive in my Ac'
Took two years on just to raise my cup
Worth a 100 fucking mill
Niggas can't keep up
What you're making in a year
I blow it in a week
Just built the guest house
Three thousand square feet
Everything go to waste
Too much money in the way
Got a b-ball court
Nigga don't even play
What thaa fuck?
I got enough weed to fill a hundred thousand blunts
Brought a playground at the crib
My daughter play on that shit once
Got a safe filled up with dirty money like Kaleena
Got a tennis court rotting cause it's waiting for Serena, bitch!
I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it
40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
What I spent today I spent it in a month I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!

Want some blow? Or to rent a boat?
Nigga need a bigger boat for all this blow
How getting doe
You ain't got no thing to blow
Fuck out of here with your blow
The rich who blow
Got it from a new blow
Actually it's old blow
It was gone for
You can say blow
Show me 700 for
By all means I was going to blow
... partner made that
Hop in the enzo
You're the bitch
Got to blow
Better tie her to the car
And the deed see high
Yea nigga I'm a blow you bitch
Blowing money, blowing strong
What's all that blow
All them blow days gone
You're the whore
Had to give me some of the blow
So I went to California
Bought a California
I just want to blow their brain
Infatuated with old mercy
I just won't admit my pain
Make me feel the power
Blow that money every hou
I got brick fare on me right now and I'll blow it
40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
What I spent today I spent it in a month I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!3Embed
