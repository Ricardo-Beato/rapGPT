Our first kiss in the livin' room
That's a hella way to end the night
A hella way to end the night
We did drugs in the bedroom (Bedroom)
That's a hella way to end the night
A hella way to end the night
But she caught me fuckin' in the bathroom (Bathroom)
Rubbers all over the bathroom
That's a hella way to end the night
Tonight (Tonight)


I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth (Mouth)
Thought I was in over my head, all my niggas is dead

It's a hell of a night for Heaven's sakes
All you see is mountain and clouds, can't hit the brakes (Brakes)
She hit me twice in the face, there goes the base
She like to lift her nylon skirt to show the lace (Lace)
She say she love me but don't know what love is
I lost love 'cause my daddy said it but ain't ever done shit
Pain is love and love is hell (Uh)
I might need some bail if this shit don't sell (Sell)
Hand on my dick while I'm coastin' up the Fiji
Slow motionin' through emotion, tint in case a nigga see me
They'll come and feed you but that felt a little easy
I brought the squeegee case it get a little greasy (Greasy)
After a moment I fell into the mist
She reminisce a nigga style, God damn a nigga rich (Rich)
Wine and cigarettes under a light
Said she lost that angel done turned into a hell of a night (Night)
You might also like
I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth (Mouth)
Thought I was in over my head, all my niggas is dead

Oh, it's a hell of a night
It's a hell of a night54Embed
