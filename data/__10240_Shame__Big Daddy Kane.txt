4 ContributorsShame! Lyrics
There's no myth or fable about the pimpin' at your label
What goes on under the table, why you think your deal is so unstable?
Now, whose the macaroni, A&R's acting phony
Once you make the matrimony, then he start to slackin' don't he
Or could it be the president that's being hesitant
Playin' his artist like a corner workin' specimen
And I ain't kidding you when I say it's political
The way they make a ridicule of artists can be pitiful
You know damn well there shouldn't be no company CO
Trying to show me about rap that's 53 or so
But yet and still they want to add advice, trying to keep their status right
When they should be working records for Gladys Knight
Who shape artists, man they catching rape charges
Once you sign on the dotted line, they lead you in the blind
Then you find, your state of revenue remains the same
Cause you getting less points than Steve Kerr be getting in a game
And just because it be too hardcore to judge it
They won't even touch it, and get to frontin' on the budget
When new artists come out, I can foresee the worst outcome
Cause everybody I know got beat their first album
So I took my contract to a lawyer so he can check it out (He don't know)
Then I took it to Dionne Warwick so she can  read my hand (She don't know)
Chorus
It's a shame, when artists gotta deal with cheats
They got game, for every young rapper they see out on the streets
You sign your name, they get like Big Red on the Five Heartbeats
Now who the blame, when you starvin' and your record label eats
You might also like
Preach brother
They say the truth will set you free, but I see signs of treachery
Go on perpetually, here's how they get you G
They use the tricks, just to juice your mix
But cross be in their heart like a vampire stabbed with a crucifix
I had the enemy in my vicinity with the false identity
Of a friend to me to injure me
They ride along just to guide you wrong
Play like they beside you strong, and start to faking moves like Olajuwon
Who side you on, revealing all that low down dirty dealing
I can see your skin peeling it changed like a chameleon
First you believe in them, but once you disagree with them
They try to get Magilla repertoire and that ain't even them
And all those who has betrayed, be fast to fade
Cause they cast a shade, with the masquerade
What's dealt, is low blows below the belt
Lord have mercy, I know how Julius Caesar must have felt
I start to think back when I was just a youth
I should have listened to the words of the God Born Truth
He said, "look out for black snakes they all up in your cypher
Black snakes you can't see therefore they sneak up and they bite ya'"
They get to flippin' cause they think you slippin'
So remember, don't get to slippin' cause they get to flippin'
And trippin', what's that you grippin', beside your hippin'
You think my heart is skippin', go save that game for Scottie Pippen
It's a shame, to see how far left people be going
They got game, to think that all this time you said you know them
It ain't the same, Aah, so now you see the way they flowin'
Now who they blame, ain't nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing

Now, wait a minute, I'm starting to see lotsa, hip-hop imposters
Is rap a category at the Oscars?
Too much Nino Brown up in your life
Cause since then, man I done seen Wesley Snipes playin' a drag queen
But yet and still you want to mimic the stars of cinema
Pretending huh? So full of it they need an enema
Cause see dig, they all like to talk big
But then they want to renege, when there's a curling iron in their wig
You talking loud and saying nothing, what's the world becoming?
The frontin', now pay attention you may learn something
Now, I ain't knocking you, but come on let's be logical
You know that it's impossible to stop the unstoppable
I would suggest that they, go back and check my resume
Cause tunes that I made yesterday, can hang out with the best today
Peace to Easy Mo, cause he makes the beats to flow
And I grab the microphone and flip it like pizza dough

Shame
Now who the blame
I need to be the Mayor, so I can change the things around here
I need to be the Governor, I need to be the Governor1Embed
