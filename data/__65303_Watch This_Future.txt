23 ContributorsWatch This Lyrics
(Ooh, Mercy)
Ayy, watch this (Ayy, watch this)
Yeah, watch this (Man, watch this)
Man, watch this (Watch this)
Ayy, watch this (Movie, movie)

Ayy, watch me, watch how I dance, watch it light up and glist'
Watch this chain, how it shine, watch it wink and it kiss
Watch the movie, young homie, I see you watching this shit
Watch me walk in the club, watch how crazy it get
Watch this
Ayy, watch this
Watch this
Man, watch this
See you standin' there, just watchin', I'ma give you somethin' to look at
Standin' there, just watchin', I'ma give you somethin' to look at, watch this

Ayy, you're standin' there, just watchin', I'ma give you somethin' to look at (Future)
All these damn diamonds, man, just motherfuckin' lookit (Shine)
Keep that shit a milli', I'd be lying if I ain't dilly
Got them True Religion Billies, pop so many tags, it's silly
My dog caught a thirty and they say he gon' appeal it
I'm blowin' through the racks like a fan on the ceiling
She got that stupid brain, but my heart ain't got no feeling
I'm iced out for real, dog, pourin' up, tripping
I'm slowin' up my motions like my diamonds backwards flipping
My nigga rolling strong, we some motherfuckin' hippies
Got a hundred thousand soldiers, I ain't motherfuckin' slippin'
I can wear my ice anywhere without no supervision
You might also like
Ayy, watch me, watch how I dance, watch it light up and glist'
Watch this chain, how it shine, watch it wink and it kiss
Watch the movie, young homie, I see you watching this shit
Watch me walk in the club, watch how crazy it get
Watch this
Ayy, watch this
Watch this
Man, watch this
See you standin' there, just watchin', I'ma give you somethin' to look at
Standin' there, just watchin', I'ma give you somethin' to look at, watch this

I'm a cold-hearted criminal, everything flashy
Young rich nigga, all my hoes get nasty
Booty shakin' bitches love a nigga with fantastic
See the money comin', I'ma flip it like gymnastic
Ten band jugg, that ain't even worth my glasses
Moscato and Patron Platinum, dumpin' out the ashes
Cold like Aspen, designer, I'm flashing
Fuck your baby mama like Kourtney Kardashian
Scotty call my phone, I be pickin' up laughing
Saks Fifth shopping, true story, I ain't bragging
I'd like to thank my jeweler, all these bad bitches I'm bagging
Check like mine, no talk, straight smashing
Ayy, watch me, watch how I dance, watch it light up and glist'
Watch this chain, how it shine, watch it wink and it kiss
Watch the movie, young homie, I see you watching this shit
Watch me walk in the club, watch how crazy it get
Watch this
Ayy, watch this
Watch this
Man, watch this
See you standin' there, just watchin', I'ma give you somethin' to look at
Standin' there, just watchin', I'ma give you somethin' to look at, watch this

Ayy
Ayy, everybody know my MO, money long like limo
Came in the game, I spend a mil' like, "Motherfuck a demo"
Ayy, watch this, ayy, watch me, ayy, watch me wiggle this for 'em
Ayy, watch me turn that one to two, then that two into four (Work, work)
I need all the extra I can get
Dismantle it, put it back together, ayy, watch me remix this bitch
Ayy, watch me count a couple hundred, watch me fuck up the lot
Ayy, watch me pull that Aston Martin out like, "Look what I bought"
Ayy, watch how everybody watch me every time that I talk
Ayy, watch me walk with my limp, ayy, fire, you know I got that, yo
Ayy, watch me stand on the couch, watch how they react when
I throw this cash up in the air while they reenact me
Ayy, watch me, watch how I dance, watch it light up and glist'
Watch this chain, how it shine, watch it wink and it kiss
Watch the movie, young homie, I see you watching this shit
Watch me walk in the club, watch how crazy it get
Watch this
Ayy, watch this
Watch this
Man, watch this
See you standin' there, just watchin', I'ma give you somethin' to look at
Standin' there, just watchin', I'ma give you somethin' to look at, watch this3Embed
