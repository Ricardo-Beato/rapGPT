9 ContributorsChampions Theme Lyrics
Tell me do you really want to be a star
Cause the road is lonely and the destination is far away
Are you prepared to leave your girl
Just so you can rule the world
Are you the champion you know you are
You think that you are
Are you the one to save the day
The day

Show me the champion in you
I'll show you the champion in me
Show me the side that they can't see
Show me the person I've been dying to meet

And it goes on and on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on and on
And it goеs on

By the way
I'll be herе to stay
By the way
I'll be here to stay
Can you hear me
Callin from the other side
So please speak clearly
I think I'm ready to leave this world behind
I think I'm ready to go this time (10, 9, 8,)
I think I'm ready to go this time (7, 6, 5, 4)
I think I'm ready to go this time (3, 2, 1)
