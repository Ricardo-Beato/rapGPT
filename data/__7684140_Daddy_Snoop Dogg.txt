14 ContributorsDaddy Lyrics
Say, boo, what's happenin'?
I need you to come see me on Saturday, alright?
Got this plan I need to run by, 'kay?
Alright, Daddy love you too
Daddy, daddy, da-da-daddy, daddy
Daddy, daddy, da-daddy (Uh, uh), daddy (Yeah, yeah)
Daddy, daddy, da-daddy

Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest
She gon' roll the weed, shoot the gun, she a savage
She put up with my shit, so if she want it, I'ma grab it
Ice all on your neck, I put them horses in the carriage
Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest
She gon' roll the weed, shoot the gun, she a savage
She put up with my shit, so if she want it, I'ma grab it
Ice all on your neck, I put them horses in the carriage

Break laws, big kahunas, and big balls
Bad bitches, I break 'em off, the big boss is back at you, pissed off
She ain't got no direction, she a bit lost
I kick it off at my penthouse loft downtown 'cross the city
She saditty, but we don't really fall in that category
She go silly for Daddy
Cincinnati bread, she do what Daddy said
From gourmet meal cookin' to givin' Daddy some head
All her bottoms is red, niggas draped in blue
Never broke a stare, she make it do what it do
Welcome to my family, from me to you
I ain't your father, I'm your daddy, bitch
Keep Daddy rich
Hold it down and don't let Daddy slip
I'm out of town, I'll be back, daddy trip
I'm gone, sit back and watch Daddy dip (Yeah)

Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest
She gon' roll the weed, shoot the gun, she a savage
She put up with my shit, so if she want it, I'ma grab it
Ice all on your neck, I put them horses in the carriage
Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest
She gon' roll the weed, shoot the gun, she a savage
She put up with my shit, so if she want it, I'ma grab it
Ice all on your neck, I put them horses in the carriage

Ooh, I ain't your father, I'm your—
Yeah, I ain't your father, I'm your—
Yeah, I ain't your father, I'm your—
I'm a big time nigga, not a bitch-flyin' nigga
Zip tie, nigga, don't try, nigga
Low patience, no fakin', I slip by, nigga
Get up in her ear, now your bitch mines, nigga
Quit lyin', nigga, your bitch for the streets
Gettin' closer to Daddy, I put her on a leash before that bitch get loose
Now we on the roof
Bitch brought the liquor, big Daddy got the juice
Five, four, three, two, one, I see her run
Captivate her mind, hop off that gun
I proceed to put the game up in her
Don't worry 'bout it, nigga, she's with a winner (Ooh-wee)
I drop the top, she light the weed up
Cruise control, I don't speed up (Ah)
Super Crip with a bitch up in the caddy
I'm not your father, bitch, I'm your daddy
She call me daddy like she don't know who her daddy is
I go up in her 'til she know I'm like a sedative
Cuttin' up like Jimmy Bones
When they pull up to my house, she gon' let 'em in
Homie like to let 'em in
Casamigo' in my body tryna settle in
I just put back on my clothes, now she wet again
She ain't trippin' 'bout no bitch that she look better than
Gotta buy my bitch a body, she my medicine

Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest
She gon' roll the weed, shoot the gun, she a savage
She put up with my shit, so if she want it, I'ma grab it
Ice all on your neck, I put them horses in the carriage
Scoot up Lamborghini with lil' shawty, she the baddest
She gon' roll the weed, shoot the gun, she a savage
She put up with my shit, so if she want it, I'ma grab it
Ice all on your neck, I put them horses in the carriage

Da-daddy, daddy (Yeah)
Daddy, daddy (Yeah)
Da-daddy, daddy (Yeah)
Daddy, daddy (Yeah)
Da-daddy, daddy (Yeah)
Daddy, daddy (Yeah)
Da-daddy, daddy (Yeah)
Daddy, daddy (Yeah)
Da-daddy, daddy (Yeah, damn)
Daddy, daddy (Yeah, I feel like I'm forgettin' somethin')
Da-daddy, daddy (Yeah, oh, yeah)
Daddy, daddy (Yeah, I remember that shit)Embed
