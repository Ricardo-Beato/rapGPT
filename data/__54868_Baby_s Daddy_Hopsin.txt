43 ContributorsBaby’s Daddy Lyrics
"Hi Marcus" "Oh, wassup?"
"Um, there's something I wanted to ask you"
"Uh, what is it?" "Um, could you do me a favor?
Oh no, no, no!

Marcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please? No! Please? No!

Hold up, throw me the mic, I got a flow to recite
You got a baby by a nigga that you don't even like
A broke nigga who thuggish, always be talkin' rubbish
Steady be causing ruckus, all because you were sluttish
Jesus, I can't believe this, freak shit!
That's the same motherfucker that you had cheated on me with! (What?!)
I knew this would happen without a question
But you said, "I never have sex without protection"
Bitch please, you left me flowing down shits creek
You sex driven like a big freak
Plus our relationship has been breached, you took a big leap
And rumor has it you sucked his dick then kissed me
And now I'm s'pose to be the father and the mental guide
Like, "Sure, I'll take care of the little guy"
Shit, you ain't puttin' me through the stress
I put your baby in a pillow case and beat it to death, bitch
You might also like
Marcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please? No! Please? No!

I'm far from a fuckin' life saver
Not you're friendly neighbor, but yet you called me during your labor
It's not my issue, take me off the menu
I'm not the one who put the motherfucker in you
I'm not a mean guy, hate to sound that foul
But I don't give a fuck about that child (You damn right)
See you chose him, then he fucked you, tag, you’re it
Too bad his dick didn't have any insurance
You knew that he was just a lame nigga prior to it
Now your ass hittin' me up thinking I would do it
Hoping we gonna spark it off like some lighter fluid
That's kinda stupid, face the facts, bitch, your life is ruined
And don't be callin' me like, "My life's a crazy blur
Rashad don't take care of the baby and makes me hurt
I wish that me and you could go back to the way we were"
Shit we can, just get rid of the baby first
Marcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please? No! Please? No!

Now I won't be your baby's daddy, I'm not the one
But you can still give me some head and maybe swallow some cum
And if you want it, then I can deliver quite clean
But don't ever send the baby to find me

Yo
Do you remember when I told you I would love you forever
And broke up with my girlfriend Heather
Kicked her to the curb, and then I got with you thinkin' that you are better
And found out you were a heart shredder
Yeah, I felt really stupid after that
Became the nigga that my crew was laughin' at, I was foolish, that's a fact
(Yup) So this is karma, you been on my shit list
So ha ha ha ha, that's what you get, bitch
Marcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please? No! Please? No!

Hey, that's life
You fuck me over
He fucked you, you got pregnant
Now you're fucked
You had me
You had me, that's the funny thing about it
And you blew it
