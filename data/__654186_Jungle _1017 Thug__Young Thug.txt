12 ContributorsJungle (1017 Thug) Lyrics
She got the red bottoms with cheetah print
She got that python Louie pocketbook
And her leggings from an ostrich
I got a snakeskin duffle full of meds
I got a gun that'll kill an elephant
My little bitch flyer than a pelican
She got a jacket made of sharkskin
And there ain't no place she hasn't been

She from the jungle, she from the jungle
Big tall Amazon out the jungle
Jungle, she from the jungle
She just a rose in this concrete jungle
Jungle, jungle, I introduced that girl to my anaconda
Jungle, jungle, I'm just like Tarzan living in the jungle

Shake your ass for Young Thug cam little nigga
You killin' all these strippers, Brian Nichols
I'm ready to make a dill, no pickle
Baby girl, I'll make you famous, you'll blow up, like a missile
Boom, boom
Hoes with no class, you know that's truancy
I see your ass, I'm pursuin' it, don't ruin it
I'm going to jail for influencin'
You done shake your ass for all my ones
Guap boys, buy you Louie sandles, no Deion
I got a stick that'll light up the room just like neon
We done have a ball here, rich baby just like (?)
Straight out the jungle, jump in a bitch like kowabunga
Got birds so she know they mundo
Spend a half milli on my face like social
You might also like
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
Big tall Amazon out the jungle
Jungle, she from the jungle
She just a rose in this concrete jungle
Jungle, jungle, I introduced that girl to my anaconda
Jungle, jungle, I'm just like Tarzan living in the jungle2Embed
