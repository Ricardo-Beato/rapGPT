1 ContributorReady To Die Lyrics
You're from the west side, nigga nigga
You're from the east side, nigga nigga
North or south side, nigga nigga
Nigga's you're ready to ride, nigga you're ready to die
You're from the west side, nigga nigga
You're from the east side, nigga nigga
North or south side, nigga nigga, hey nigga f*ck what you say
I bail in and say h√©

Why you let these motherfucking clones on my throne
B*tch get out daddy's home let it be known
All through these inner streets where niggas ride
Eye to eye in f*cking traffic or we collide
All i know up in this world is to survive
Take this money, take his girl and take his life
And i don't wanna, all i wanna do is bend the corner to the avenue's
Without one running up against the ooze
Mammy get the bad news, cousins already begging for my tennis shoes
I got the diggy diggy daz rindin' shotgun, see them hoes over there watching knock him, cock it back and pop some
Pull up to the left, and cube pull up to the right
Step up to your b*cth get up hope, that's what's she like
A doggpound nigga going hard for the cheese, with my nigga cube nigga
So you know it's bitch please
Don't drop li'll nigga, unless you got one of these, AK 47's white teasing dicktease
On the mission just to get it, i get it and then i flip it
Crippin', my nigga's lynchin, so why don't you just pay attention
You might also like
You're from the west side, nigga nigga
You're from the east side, nigga nigga
North or south side, nigga nigga
Nigga you're ready to ride, nigga you're ready to die
You're from the west side, nigga nigga
You're from the east side, nigga nigga
North or south side, nigga nigga
Nigga you're ready to ride, nigga you're ready to die

Take a toke what you call a joint is a roach, claustrophobic in coach
First class for that ass, me and daz is like a macna blast
You got it have it, how long would your cheddar last
Up in sam goody with your tec 9 in your hoody
If you dont grab america's most, you're a rookie
I got five on everythang, "on everythang", let me rhyme i get live on everythang
The world is mine and i rides on everythang, westside till i die
Let the ghetto sang, "let the ghetto sang", let the metal bang
You know it's on in the motherf*cking streets
If a nigga wanna see me then come find me
Drop you like it's hot, now f*ck you life
I don't give a f*ck about you, b*tch you ain't my type
See whe the nigga's in the club that take your life
Sit yo punk ass down, you ain't gonna fight
So you're a buster, a mob got to see it in your eyes
Let a nigga disrespect your hood, it ain't gonna ride
What kind of nigga is you, i put the flame to the fume
If you run up on me nigga, boy your ass is through
You're from the west side, nigga nigga
You're from the east side, nigga nigga
North or south side, nigga nigga
Nigga you're ready to ride, nigga you're ready to die
You're from the west side, nigga nigga
You're from the east side, nigga nigga
North or south side, nigga nigga
Nigga you're ready to ride, nigga you're ready to dieEmbed
