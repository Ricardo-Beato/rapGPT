20 ContributorsHalf Lyrics
Dear diary
33 years old (33)
I'm a couple million up
I'm a single parent
It's Guwop
Very successful
I'm love my little boy
It's just the truth
Cherish my mother

And I just want half
But these hoes want half
How the hell you get a bitch half?
I would've cut that bitch in half
Cause I could never give a bitch half

What if I was on my last
You mean she'd get half of my cash
Man that bitch can kiss my ass
It's Guwop, she will never get half
This AK knock a nigga in half
Like a magician I cut a bitch just, half
I came up, me and Juice I had a half
I cut the head down of 50 dollar slabs
Now I'm trappin hard, I'm on Gresham ave
A nigga play me, I'm a cut him in half
Dirty gang, you gon' take a blood bath
It's Gucci Mane, got 3 million in cash
I got a real real big stash
I hate it when I see the task
These bitches man, they love to harass
I mean these bitches love to harass
You's a stalker, You's a stalker, You's a stalker
34 bowls on Herschel Walker
Gucci Mane man, I'm a smooth talker
And I control a bitch like a snake charmer
You might also like

Gucci Mane not Tiger Woods, I can't even putt
I can give a mutt, half for me, half a, half a what
Roll my dick, I didn't have shit, had to hit a lick
Broke as shit, couldn't pay the rent, ain't that bout a bitch?
Man Gucci don't got half what Michael got but got a lot
I don't cross over, I cross the country, fuck a jump shot
Don't pun Mr. Backboy, Bessma is a stack boy
You think it's hamburger helper, how Gucci would fuck the extra
Don't wanna give you half, you ain't water whippin', bitch in Bessma
I will not give you half
You didn't put that hater on a stretcher
Man I don't pass no mid to Gucci he gon' break out with a rash
These trashcan bitches, man don't need to make me laugh laugh
Fat ass, ugly ass, go get that paper bag
I'm a player hater, punching bag, he know I got a sack
In my building shoot the say designer, Gucci gotta swag
Gucci can't wear skinny jeans he's walking with a bag
I like all money green but I don't like my hoes to match
I like all money green but I don't like my hoes to match
I sign my check and employ myself, I don't even gotta scratch
I sign my check and employ myself, I don't even gotta scratch
Half
