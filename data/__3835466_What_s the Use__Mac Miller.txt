Yeah

You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute wit' it, fuck a little
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

Yeah
Okay, we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker, hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem
What it is, what it truly might be, nothin' that you know of
You don't need to hol' up
I'm so a-bove and beyond
You take drugs to make it up way up where we on
Space shuttle, Elon
Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up
Then I have her sing just like Céline Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta, "Yes, I am"
All the way in wit' no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close
I don't understand why you doin' the most
You might also like
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want a (Want a) 'nother ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? (Use)
Never (Never) super- (Super) -ficial (Ficial)
You gon' (You gon') know it (Know it) when it (When it) hit you (Hit you)
Get a (Get a) little (Little) senti- (Senti) -mental when I'm off the juice (Turn it up)

Well, I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day, spend money
When I had nothin', shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worry my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, "Get up outta my shade"
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em outta that frame, shit
I'm up thirty thou' miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'til I'm out
And it is what it is 'til it ain't, yeah
Ooh-oh, up above the clouds
Ooh, I just wanna fly
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ha

You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want a (Want a) 'nother ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? (Use)
Never (Never) super- (Super) -ficial (Ficial)
You gon' (You gon') know it (Know it) when it (When it) hit you (Hit you)
Get a (Get a) little (Little) senti- (Senti) -mental when I'm off the juice (Juice)

You can love it
It just freaks me out38Embed
