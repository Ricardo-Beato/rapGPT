This is for all your suffering
Judgmental cunt, uh (Ahem)
Hmm, mmm
Select your potion

Stay tuned, stay tuned
Stay tuned, stay tuned

Yeah, you're just some fuck-up little kid
Just some loser kid, and you're never ever going to be shit
Everywhere he goes, loser little kid
Introverted kid, hating everybody type of guy
Look at you, dumb punk loser kid
You ain't never gon' be shit, somebody told you lies
Can't hear a thing, too preoccupied sipping kerosene

Stay tuned, stay tuned
Stay tuned, stay tuned

You're just some loser little boy
Can't ever do a damn thing right, you'll never be shit
They called him the loser, loser boy
And you'll never be anything but a fucking lowlife
Look at you, dumb stoner little boy
You'll never be nothing nigga, don't get this shit twisted
Oh, we shall see what fate shall bring
You might also like
Stay tuned, stay tuned
Stay tuned, stay tuned

Yow, yow, help me, yow, how, yow, hey!
Yow, yow-yow-yow-yow, how, how, how, yow, how how how, yeah!
Hey! Hey!
