5 ContributorsGirl Like U Lyrics
If I didn't have no dough
Would you love me?
If we didn't have a place to go
Would you still be there?
Or would you leave me alone
When the chips are down?
Or would you stay around
And be down, oh girl
I gotta have a chick like you
I gotta have a girl like you
I gotta have a chick like you
I gotta have a girl like you

Eh..eh, eh, eh
Hey little Unc, who that is standing there like that?
Lookin' from the front, but I can see what's in the back
Hips like (Oh!), thighs like (Oh!)
Pretty toes in a row and they be lookin' like (Oh!)

I don't know nephew, let's just do what we do
Let's just slide up on these hoes and put this pimpin' to use (Agreed!)
And then what we do (What we do?)
You take the one in the white, I take the one in the blue
Preach!

Now once the night wounds down, and the weed gets low
Players still playin', and I'm still on a float
I groove to the beat, 'til my feet get tired
I just want to be your desire
Eva Knieva, best believe-a
Your not a dime piece, your a diva
Take it from me you can be the, O-N-E
If you roll wit me

Now if looks was the case, baby girl'll be federal
The top half - incredible, the bottom half - edible (huh)
I ain't telling you what I heard, mayne I'm telling you what I know
And I ain't telling her where to stay, or where to go
And, if she, want me, we'll take a trip down, wit the homie
The D-O-double-G
And if I'm lonely, jump from a lil' town
And it's low-key, and guess who wear the crown (Whoo!)

If I didn't have no dough, would you love meeee? (Would you love me, girl?)
If we didn't have a place to go, would you still be therrrre? (Would you still be there?)
Or would you leave me alone, when the chips are dowwwn? (when the chips are down)
Or would you stay around, (oh, oh) and beeee down
Oh girl! (Oh!)
(If so!) I gotta have a chick like you (I gotta, I gotta)
(If so!) I gotta have a girl like you (I like this part)
(If so!) I gotta have a chick like you (Make a nigga clap to this)
(If so!) I gotta have a girl like you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And if ya came to party wit the D-O-double-G, and the N-E-double-L-Y band1Embed
