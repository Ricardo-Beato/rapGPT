Baby, I look good, I look handsome

Baby,  I look good, I look handsome
Somebody  gon' take me for ransom
Everybody 'round me was dancin'
Ain't nobody 'round me could have none
Baby,  you look good, you look pretty
I  know why you stopped fuckin' with me
It's a lot of bomb in the city
But  you know nobody could get (You)

It's a hottie, it's a body, we ain't missin' no meals
I ride shotty, she like five somethin' but six in them heels
I'm a Ducati, you gonna do ninety down 290, huh?
Know  where you goin', know where to find me, know where to find me, huh?
Big fine, rotisserie (Muah, yeah)
My big tongue make it slippery (Huh)
I give you a sec' I'll let you shake it out (Huh)
Now, let's run it back, this time don't make a sound (Shh, oh yeah)
Make it wop, uh
Climb up to the top and do a split and make it drop
You look good naked, look good pregnant, anything you make it pop
You out here bakin', hot like Megan on my bacon when it pop (Hey, pop, hey)
Baby, you look good, you look gorgeous
This right here your city, I'm a tourist
I know I'm a catch, I'm a swordfish
Got me on your hook, on your chorus
You might also like
Baby, I look good, I look handsome (Do)
Somebody gon' take me for ransom (They will)
Everybody 'round me was dancin'
Ain't nobody 'round me could have none (You can't)
Baby, you look good, you look pretty (You do)
I know why you stopped fuckin' with me (I do)
It's a lot of bomb in the city (Ah, ah, ah)
But you know nobody could get

Well-known all across the globe
For my player ways and my skimpy clothes
Houston hottie with a model body
I'ma bust it open like a centerfold
Bad bitch with a lot of options (Yeah)
After me, it's really hard to top it (Hey)
She don't suck it sloppy, she don't like to ride it
She don't lick the balls, she ain't really wifey, ah (Ah, ah)
All that talking shit, you know that excite me (That excite me)
And I know that mean you love me
When you tell me you don't like me (Ayy)
And I know you need some pussy
When you argue and we fightin'
Don't you put them in our business
If we beefin', keep it private, huh (Ayy, yeah)
Baby, you look good, you look handsome (Handsome)
Rich nigga put that dick up for some ransom (Ayy, ayy, ransom)
Before I let you go, I had to have some (Ooh, ooh, have some)
Rich bitch so you know I got my bands up (Ahh)
Baby, I look good, I look handsome (Do)
Somebody gon' take me for ransom (They will)
Everybody 'round me was dancin'
Ain't nobody 'round me could have none (You can't)
Baby, you look good, you look pretty (You do)
I know why you stopped fuckin' with me (I do)
It's a lot of bomb in the city (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
But you know nobody could get (You)3Embed
