24 ContributorsLost Yâ€™all Mind Lyrics
Wop
Hol' up, Spiffy on this motherfucker
Qua', burr

Ice caucasian, but I'm black as hell (Ice, black)
My bitch bright skin, but she black as well (Black)
Plus, all my whips like a color book
Sellin' dope ain't gettin' old, we got cola to cook
They say I got a man bag, but I got hunnids to tote (Hunnids)
If you took no mind, you would never be broke (Never)
Put the brick in the yoke, burglar bar on the door
I pay the neighbor next do' so she don't tell what she know
All paper for parole, quarter mil' for a show (Fuck 'em)
Used to buy a half a ki', I turn that shit to a whole (Flip it)
2012, did more drugs than I sold (Whoa now)
My dope like a Chia Pet, ya water it, it grows (Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia)
I bring the income with the long arm with yay on the stove (Yuh)
My buddy neck filled with Vs, they think he sellin' his soul (Huh)
Don't know we trappin' in the snow, pray don't fuck up the flow
This that cocaine flow, turn your man to a Jane Doe (Go)

Woo, hey
I done re'd-up a million times (Woo, re-up)
Nigga, y'all done lost your mind (What the fuck? Woo)
Money coming in on time (Woo, cash, racks, racks)
Nigga, y'all done lost your mind (Hey)
You might also like
We trappin' at an all time high (Time high)
Fall fashion, but we wintertime fly (Time fly)
We eatin' good, it's dinner time now (Time now)
No amateurs, beginner time now (Time now)
My AP like a teen in his prime (In his prime)
Bustin' through the motherfuckin' hole (Fuckin' hole)
Went platinum 'fore I ever went gold (Went gold)
Dope jumpin' out the motherfuckin' bowl (Burr)
Don't bother me, I'm doin' what I do best (Fuck 'em)
Nike shoe box, hunnids where the shoes at (Shoes at)
And they blue, but I never been a cowboy (Huh?)
I'm not from Cali, but they runnin' In N' Out boy (Out boy)
I'm from the Peach State, the birds fly south, boy (Yuh)
Oh, that's your son? To them, he just another white boy (Huh?)
You had a bright plan, I give you "Nice try," boy (Try boy)
But now you tied up, no one can hear your cry boy (Go)

Woo, hey
I done re'd-up a million times (Woo, re-up)
Nigga, y'all done lost your mind (What the fuck? Woo)
Money coming in on time (Woo, cash, racks, racks)
Nigga, y'all done lost your mind (Hey)1Embed
