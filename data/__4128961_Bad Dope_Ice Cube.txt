8 ContributorsBad Dope Lyrics
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
(There's no prescription to this addiction)
I'm like a bad drug
(Just a dope face decision, sleep with the pigeons)
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
(There's no intervention to this prevention)
I'm like a bad drug
(My incision will separate you from your pension)
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
(Takin' you to the E.M.S.)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)

If you fuck with me, I'm like some headache weed
I'm like your favorite dope mixed with antifreeze
I'll attack your brains, I'll collapse your veins
Have you actin' strange like a dog with the mange
Worse than cocaine, it's that Kurt Cobain
Make you go insane, make your world go bang
There's no prescription for my encryption
There's only addiction to this non-fiction
You might also like
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
Bad dope
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope

Don't even start, boy, I'll get you sparked
Make you lose all your shit, now you livin' at the park
Crackheads are blackheads
Meth heads are left dead
Bitches on that bad dope, heard they give the best head
Oh, shit, bad trip, battery acid
Now you lookin' old as fuck, face made of plastic
I serve you, way towards you, pay for it with face sores
Now you walkin' around skin like alligator
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
Bad dope
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope

Grip it, hit it
Vomit, shit it
Smoke it, choke it, bitch, poke it
Dirty needle, mosquito, I can fly like a beetle
I'm the Beatles, I am Tito
I am Michael, think I'm psycho
On them pills, in them hills ridin' on that motorcycle
Crazy nigga, let me hit it, gotta have it 'fore I stab it
Silly rabbit, snatch and grab it
I got a fuckin' habit
Steal from momma, pills from momma
If I die, send the bill to momma
I ain't shit, never be Obama
Dope head, nigga, never be Obama
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope (Bad dope, bad dope)
I'm like a bad drug
Bad dope
I'm a bad drug about to fuck you up
Bad dope

There's no intervention, just prevention
My incision will separate you from your pension
I'm takin' you to the abyss
Drag you under, drown you1Embed
