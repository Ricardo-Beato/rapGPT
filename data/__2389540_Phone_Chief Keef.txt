9 ContributorsPhone Lyrics
I'm double in it
I ain't had no sleep in 'bout a week (Huh)
Got your thottie to my house, she's 'bout to freak with me
() 'Bout to freak, 'bout to freak
I ain't had no sleep in 'bout a week
Just got your thottie to my house, she's bout to freak
Fucking with her (Geek, nigga)
Beep, nigga

I ain't have no sleep in 'bout a week
Just got your thotty to my house, she's 'bout to freak
I'm fucking with whoever ride with me
Is you gon' blow your pistol? Boy, we's 'bout to see
I dont owe you, boy, I got here on my own
Back in them days, I was out here on my own
Now these boys don't like I'm on the throne
Ain't no peace treaties, boy, don't call my phone

Smokin' on Tooka with my click-clack, fuck the chit-chat
Fuck nigga, you better get back 'fore your ass get whacked
Niggas all about that chit-chat over that internet, ayy
I ain't with that damn chit-chat on that internet, ayy
Blammin' at these fuck niggas like "Bow, bow, bang", ayy
And I got them damn wow-wow's in my chain, ayy
Ayy, and I got them damn wow-wow's in my earrings, ayy
Ayy, finna get them damn wow-wow's on some rings, ayy
Put some wow-wow's on that range
Put some wow-wow-wow's on that motherfucking Beamer, ayy
Ayy, hoes say I talk like I'm from Alabama
Nah, bitch, this ain't country grammar, ayy, ayy, ayy
You might also like
Jackson just like Samuel, ayy
Did you read the motherfucking manual, ayy, ayy
Lemme check my schedule, ayy, ayy
Choppa go "du-du-du", let it go

I ain't have no sleep in 'bout a week
Just got your thotty to my house, she's 'bout to freak
I'm fucking with whoever ride with me
Is you gon' blow your pistol? Boy, we's 'bout to see
I dont owe you, boy, I got here on my own
Back in them days, I was out here on my own
Now these boys don't like I'm on the throne
Ain't no peace treaties, boy, don't call my phone1Embed
