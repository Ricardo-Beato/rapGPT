73 ContributorsNuyork Nights at 21 Lyrics
Ayy, she just wanna leave me (Ayy), she just wanna be free (Uh, no)
She don't wanna be with me (No), she don't wanna be with me (No)
She just wanna, uh, leave me (Woah)
She don't wanna be with me (Everybody do something for me, FKi)
I just wanna be me

And I know I made mistakes, I will never let you down (I won't)
And you know I can't wait (Wait), tell me what we do now (Now)
What about the times you looked at me like you loved me, gave me the face
It was times putting nothing above you, not even the cake
I need you the most, more important than dough
Never felt this before, have you felt this before?
I might even hold you close like you my antidote
Understand you let me go, but you still at my show

Said she from L.A., but she stayin' uptown
Stayin' uptown, stayin' uptown
Said she 'bout to go downtown, party up and down
Party up and down, yeah, party up and down

I say, yeah, she with her friends, yeah, yeah, she getting wild
Yeah, they getting wild, yeah, she getting wild
Thought of something important baby, it is nothing now
It is nothing now, I said it is nothing now
And I thought they just was hating, no, they wasn't hating
I was just on wait and you was contemplating
We was in the same book, but we different pages
We was in the same book, but we different pages
Better yet, we like the same, she my other half
I was rocking Rick Owens, you was rocking RAF
Never took it serious, we slept in on Bape clothes
We treat them like play clothes, all these bitches snake hoes

Oh, and I, and I know
And I, and I know
Oh, and I know
And I, and I know
Oh, yeah, I swear I know
Yeah, I swear I know
Oh, yeah, I know
Yeah, I, yeah, I know
I won't let, I won't let her
I won't let, I won't let her leave
I won't let her go, I won't let her go
I won't let her go, I won't let her go, I won't
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh17Embed
