20 ContributorsHood Go Bang! Lyrics
This is how it sounds when the hoods go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG! (Yeah)
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
Yeah, here we go (Here we go)
I said this is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG! (BANG!)
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
*click click* BANG!

Yo, this is how it sound when the hood go bang
You can cop a couple of bricks of good cocaine
I’m a block scholar, call me Dollars, I don’t change
I’m a Rottweiler, diamond collar with gold fangs
Yep, a top shotter, Don Dada, rhyme proper
Might even take the ‘R’ out of brother—why bother?
Mic on Halloween, I mean, I’m clearly a monster
We gathered here today so that I could dearly depart ya
Math, bars better than Willy Wonka’s
It’s how to get away with a murder—you feel me, Shonda?
Rhymes like karma, I’m hood, stash the contra
You ever hear a rhymer this good, smack ya mamas
But it’s still death over dishonor
‘Cause you can get it next and get death over this drama
Math verse Meth, this Civil War is a starter
Men turn to martyrs, Wu-Tang bang regardless

Yeah, this is how it sounds when the hoods go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
Yeah, here we go (Here we go)
I said this is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
*click click* BANG! BANG!3Embed
