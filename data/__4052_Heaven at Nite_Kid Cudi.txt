Have you ever been to heaven at night? Night
Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night

Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Closing your eyes, the feeling so right
At first you might see just one bright beam of light
Clutching your soul to the toll of the bright
Happy unites and feelings take flight
Blind to the evils, you give them no sight
Focus on floatin', your focus is tight
Like you rewrote an essay for a class, to pass in the night
Have you ever seen an ending so nice?
You feel so free, like you're high as a kite
Like how you feel if you drink some Bud Light, followed by Jag
Models who smile, then tilt their head back
These are a few of the visions I like
Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
This is my heaven at night

Have you
Ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night
Oh, have you
Ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night

Man, oh
I need what the world can't give me
Can't give me
Man, oh
I see what the world can't show me
Can't show me
Dawg, oh
I lack what the world can't give me
Can't give me
Dawg, oh
I sing it but the world can't hear me
Can't hear me

Heaven at night
Heaven at night

Have you
Ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night
Oh, have you
Ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night24Embed
