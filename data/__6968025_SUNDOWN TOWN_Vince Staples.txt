40 ContributorsSUNDOWN TOWN Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Where you from? Where your gun?
Pacing around
Stay awake, know I got a play to make
And moving across the room
Stay awake, know I got a play to make
Pacing around
Gotta stay awake, know I got a play to make
Let's move all across the room
Yeah

I can die tonight, so today, I'm finna go get paid
I'm the violent type, so don't play 'less you want your grave
We was in the hood, rent was late, ain't have Section 8'
Had a .38 in the eighth, moved on 68th
Then, they put us out, we was sleepin' on my auntie couch (Pacing around)
Then she put us out, stomach growling, stealing from the Ralph's (And moving across the room)
If I pull it out, I'ma send a nigga to the clouds (Pacing around)
Watch them bullets bounce (Let's move all across the room)
Fell in love with guns, I love the sound, yeah

From the sun-up 'til the sun is down, yeah
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah
From the sun-up 'til the sun is down, yeah
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah

I don't fear no man, only Allah got the upper hand
Lost too many friends to the down-the-streets, I can't pretend
That I'll make amends, I know that the blood gon' spill again
Hanging on them corners same as hanging from a ceiling fan
When I see my fans, I'm too paranoid to shake they hands
Clutching on the blam, don't know if you foe or if you fam
I don't got a plan, I'm just out here thugging 'til the end (Yeah)
Niggas know I'll never fold or bend (Yeah, free 03), yeah

Pacing around
And moving across the room
Pacing around
Let's move all across the room

From the sun-up 'til the sun is down, yeah (Pacing around)
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah (And moving across the room)
From the sun-up 'til the sun is down, yeah (Pacing around)
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah (Let's move all across the room)

I am tired, tired, over again
I am tired, tired, over again
Tired, over again9Embed
