Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was Illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school, man, right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She asked why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look at what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

What's the noise all about with this rap stuff?
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
'Cause it's a mental game
I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm copping stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on
Not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

Got my first chain

On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what way I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flyin'
I know the higher the goal, the harder the climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
'Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF, GOOD, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills til' my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dodging shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches are with you cuz where you at?
I got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams
Would've seen me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Went from feelin' hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now? Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is, the troublesome chick
Who throws fists; sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up, but when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes, so dead it
Shred it; young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go, my life is fucking awesome
I could be fuckin' dead right now, but I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god
'Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God
It might be too late, but the songs will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance
More like a prance, I'm signing off with a crotch grab

Thank you, man, for letting me get on this record, Sean

Tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it
I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I
So I give him my email on a fly
And if his song's good I'll reply
Trick Trick: Hello

Shorty: Ay bro, ay nigga I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg

Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need
I'm sorry

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying "Fuck you," "I miss you," or "I hate you so much"
'Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say "Be real," I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in the Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, "Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga, I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?"
Then she called the next guy, spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he got to deal with

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "Ain't no woman like the one I got!"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart (Tunechi)
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start (Damn)
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy

You always be calling her, she ain’t never answering
You ain’t figured out I am the reason that she canceling

If I wasn’t me, wasn’t committed
I told my mom and my dad it’ll be the last Christmas
In the hood that you can visit
Oh boy I got it, no chasers
Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Ready set go, on your mark to the top
Getting rich ain’t a blessing it’s a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the fucking bottle
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model

Re-up time for every penny, never fronted
Showroom floor, paid every penny then I stunted
Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman
TS4 with 23’s I’m talking jumpmans
Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rush
Just don’t get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion
Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken
If them niggas think I’m riding with that, them niggas tripping
Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause’ imma’ grinder
Told my O's, "I'm hiding you here, so they won’t find you"
What you know about a bag that’s heavy as anacondas?
Bet you one thing, I ain’t talking no marijuana
That’s whats wrong with these niggas they think it’s about shine

No yoga boy I was making blow stretch
Press the fast forward button, I’m pushing a foreign something
All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood
My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good
It’s time for a new crib, it’s time for a new chain
20 thousand on me homie that’s just loose change
Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess
But if you knew bout my hood you’d say that nigga is blessed

Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
Going from a population of nearly 2 million

I'm a real D-Boy, take a look up in my face
Never did real estate, and still put you in your place
I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas
From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski
Every time I spit a verse, my city like "Preach!"
Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets
B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast
Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet
Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week
Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats
Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave
Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speak in Trapanese
If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back
Back on my feet, that's just how I be
I be out of town repping valid as an absentee
Lord, jeeze, jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me
Fuck these niggas up, now it's absent teeth
Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the Playoffs bitch

Momma feeling like she Jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest
Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad
Would drive me to school every single chance he had
Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past
And gave me the talks that made me to a man
Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam
And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand
Coming from Detroit where everybody say "what up doe?"
Horror movie shit, cause everybody there cut throat
Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though
Even though you deserved a commission plus mo
And grandma sad when she saw my commercial
"Stop having people at your shows that wasn't at rehearsals"
I’m tryna to get a office at the Empire State
To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home
Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state
Prayin' that I won't be late

Ironically those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe its because I had you girl

You and all your girls moved to NY

I know I wasn’t honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl
Brought problems to your world
And you said “how could you just lie to me? I thought you’d die for me?”
I was scared you’d find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to

Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy

Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas
Hit the club, lose seven Gs, film it all on 7D's
Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest of my G's rest with a piece
Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team
Same show, different seats, same game, different league
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see

Bitches that I know, everything that I've done wrong
All the licks I hit, all the bullets missed
Got my shit legit, a lot of people pissed, well

Drugs and women coming too
Got my family living comfortable
Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do

Finally Famous in this…

It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit, do yourself a favor, kick 'em out
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the nights it’s all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now Mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I gotta walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know
Stuntin' like a bitch, prom night me out
Had the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back when I was seventeen
It's crazy though, 'cause even then I thought I had It all figured out

You might also like
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times that I missed out on more than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have more than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lying and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin' overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, Black History Month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane, I'm Rozay Parks
SUV swervin' like it's O.J.' car
Oh, so me and my dogs is all gettin' out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck

Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all triggered out
Even when it…all of it…when you still ain't got…
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder
And it doesn't tell you how old or young-minded someone is
'Cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends
And the only way to be immortalized is to be remembered
Hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award
It's about the award of being immortalized and remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten
No footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
With who thinks about you
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it
Winning the game
Hall of fame14Embed
Yo, waddup this is Kanye and you're checking out Big Sean, Finally Famous: Volume 1
It's crazy though how I met him, you know
I'm leaving the radio station and he comes up to me like "Yo, I just wanna spit for you"
And I say "Okay, you got 16" and he went and spit about 100 bars and I looked at him
And I said "That shit was crazy, I'mma sign you"
I know I'd just seen pretty like unbelievable, the stories we always hear about
But when I heard the songs he was doing, man I knew he had to be on GOOD Music
So man, congratulations dawg, you're finally famousYou might also likeEmbed

Youknowmsayin?
Marl: Aight, kick it...
(Farmers Boulevard)

Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin' games people play
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin' to my man
Talkin' bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin', I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard

Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
(Sh...) I'm makin moves, not fakin moves
So don't you never come around here, talkin that talk
Or walkin that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savor
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! L'll have you breakin' locks
I'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin forties of beers
On the Boulevard
Cool J: Funky, funky, funky rhymes bein' said here
Marl: Hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo Uncle L, let's go...
J: Yeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip
Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little somethin'

Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleein' like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, cause the brother who cross me's gettin buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mutha...'s comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handin me a mic is like givin' a chainsaw to Leatherface
Smokin MC's in an instant
At my side bustin caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip makin you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up
Yo, yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo
Cool J: Yeah, we livin' Chinese people in a Turkish bath, baby
Marl: Hi C over there, man
J: Yo, what's up Hi C...

Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin' mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leavin' bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreadin' terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a bodybag)
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother

Yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo
I was -
Yo, what's up?
Nine years ago, man
Youknowmsayin?

Marley Marl: Yo, I was kinda -
I was kinda stagnant to sleep on it
But yo, L
Won't you - won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?
J: Aight, let me sum this up

Now you heard the brothers speakin 'bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hittin', beats kickin', you can't get none
F-A-R-M-E-R-S passin' the test
Marley Marl in the background doin the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, Kato
Get up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh
I did a jam against all odds
And it was dedicated to Farmers Boulevard
(Farmers Boulevard)
Keep on

To the beat, y'all
A funky beat, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stopEmbed
(Big Sean baby, holla at your boy)
(It’s your boy, come and give me)

Man I remember days I used to get up
Praying like a bishop that this music stuff would pick up
I always tried to haul my own load like a pickup
No ordinary nigga
And if you work harder then success will come quicker
But make sure you don't take it to the head like liquor
Aim for the stars, I’m shooting for the bigger dipper
Nights I used to sit up
Man I could feel the hunger in my stomach like sit-ups
Now I’m eating to the point that a nigga got the hiccups
I get up like, damn
I see the sun shine through the dust clouds
We bought our own cars, no more taking the bus now
And it ain’t bust a broad or hoes that we bust down
You should probably see the model chicks that we bust now
And we don’t chase them ‘cause they wanna chase us now
All my ex-dames say they wanna make up now
Take ‘em to the room and they wanna rape us now
Damn

(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)

Man I went through the cold nights
(We’ll never forget)
The wrongs and rights
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the hoes and the highs
(We’ll never forget)
The fights, the struggle on the grind, the hustle
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the shows and the lights

Man my city a hell hole like we like with Satan
Tried to make it to Penn State, they throw us in state pen
I’m saying from the rim of the capitol
Concrete jungle where they hunt you like animals
Cut you in half like the sandwich and abandon you
You gon’ need a bit more than a bandaid to bandage you
Damn it dude
And if you turn your back they might stab you in the kidneys
Really niggas known to keep the peace a hippy
But now I tend to spread my wealth around like Jiffy
And the hoes that used to diss me is the ones who wanna kiss me
The ones who wanna kiss me is the ones who wanna quickie
They see I ball hard now, all nine innings
I feel like I made it to the top of the mountain
Rocking designer shit that you don’t be pronouncing
Pissing in fountains
Getting money to the point I need an accountant
Just to count it, yeah
(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)
(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will

Man shoutout to me and my crew
Feels good to make something out of nothing, you know
Aye DJ why don't you play some of my shit, man?

And I’m hoping I’m turning you on like a console
‘Cause with that weave in your head you lookin’ like Tonto
So Ima want the breast and thigh with that, like the combo
She know I’m in charge, she callin’ me the head honcho
And baby I’m afraid if I can’t get that skirt off, then Ima probably hop up in the whip and skrrt off

I realize that I don’t need hoes, they need me
Soon as they see me, “Oh, I heard your CD”

So presidential, I should move to DC
You could ask Kiki, Michelle, and Niecy
They all, take it to the summit like BGs
That’s bubble guts, damn
And I ran through a couple sluts, that’s a whole lotta bubble butts, word?
Periodically like the shuttle bus
And Ima probably order all them hoes some Moet
‘Cause that get ‘em more wet and that mean more sex
Girl, call up your friend, let me come hit the whole set
And Ima probably have them hung up like the coat check
Girl, get on your knees let me give you a throat check
And since they and their friends want some, oh them hoes next

Stay close to me, so close to me

You been holding me down

I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright

Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall

"Might not make it this time"
Is what not to say at this time
Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear
And you tell them they alright, knowing they need a cure
How I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand
Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand
Around the same time my mom said "Sean, you need a plan
Miss Freeman's son, across the street got shot, now she need a hand!"
Traumatized, God oh why's his momma cry
Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, gotta tell this momma lies
Like, "It's gonna be alright," knowing it ain't alright
And I know it's so much pain, and there's probably more on the way

Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall

You know I love you momma like she mine
Whether we together, or we trying
We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times
We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time
The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime
It came from the breast, just spread to the spine
It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:
"This can't be my mom!"
Got me thinking, "whats a girl to do, a girl to do?
When her world's a pool?
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
And all the stress is all propane
She's burned again"
Hoping I could make her smile
Take cancer and David Blaine it out
POOF! Disappear, God make an out!

Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say it's going to be, alright
It's going to be, alright

Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing

Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing

Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill

Man, I'm so tired of praying for this free shit
Man, being broke is some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's, one dollar double cheese
Or some nights, I wouldn't eat shit
But there always was girls on my penile
And I fell victim to the vaginal
But when it comes to the ass chase
No thank you, rather run in the cash race
'Till the world knows Sean
The only thing getter better in time besides wine
Honestly better than all these asses
With no practice, for real just as is
I didn't have to go to school, I was better at this
Watch a nigga pull more strings than Lenny Kravitz
So I can say I have it, iff not I wish I had it
I do it with a passion

And we just started, we ain't nowhere near the outro
I'll tell y'all what I'm about though
High ends, high spendin'
We just tryin' to end life on a high note, Soprano
And I was supposed to be on for a minute
Man I've been writin' songs for a minute
And you can ask Kanye, you can ask G-Ro, you can ask Don C
Hip-hop where the hell you find a nigga like me
Snotty nose lil' nigga, used to tear up ice cream
Now I'm wearin' Ice Cream with a chain on my shirt
Call that bitch an Ice-T
So tell me what it takes to go from sittin' on porches
To sittin' in Porsches, take in less fortunate
And turn it into a fortune
And make my mama proud that she didn't get that abortion


I'm gone make a million, just wait 'till tomorrow, I'm gon' make a million
Do it again, we gone do it again, do it again1Embed

Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

I'm the livin' proof
That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed

And be the man you have to be
Holdin' ship down, don't crash at sea"
Brrrt! Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now

Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that

Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett

Thanking God for all my setbacks
'Cause He the reason I'm able to get back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, woah
Yeah
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Yeah

This the feeling know that I been missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have
On Sunday with Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or the spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Timb's, in the Lamb, mixing it in with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan, bucket hat like Gilligan (Yeah)
Lately, I been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone, though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, Grandma and Mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan
Funny thing about it, you always act like you knew
You told me I would feel it would happen before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and Grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me of how we used to dress up
As a family and go to Sunday service, and be in church singin'
Ain't been to church in a while, but it ain't just 'bout how you just praise Him
In the building, it's about how you praisin' Him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
To my all time low self and throw me a jetpack, woah
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone, or any other
Girl look like Lisa Bonet whose jealous of me and Jhené
Who you would always advise would be in the way
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of ya 'til I see you myself

Because of you, I survived
Because of you, I'm still alive

Thanking God for all my setbacks
'Cause He the reason I'm able to get back

Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, woah
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back

Look, I spent my whole life tryna improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this, I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light

All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gonna take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass, glass
Honestly, I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play the blame game
Point the fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust, I don't wanna have a fake us
But all that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

My friends say I should be over you
Getting hurt every time I'm close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

Nigga, you know what's about to go down when you walk out that door
Man, I hope these niggas not out here man, fuck
Big Sean, boy, swerve

Ok, we see you
New girl, new car
Lamborghini Mercy, ok we feel it
Ayy, is this the- is this like the real thing this time with this one?
Or is this another one of those flings?
Like, you gonna bring her home to mom
Does mom know about this one?We know you're close with your mom
What you say about animal cruelty?
Like do you think they should have shot Harambe or like what?
I mean do you think he was going to maul the kid?
We seen you in the furs man, don't lie17Embed

Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me 'bout
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
(Yeah, you know what's about to go down)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck
(That's your problem, you don't listen!)

Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan

Stick to the, plan

Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracted
Put that into what's worth having (boy)
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing

Stick to the, plan

Stay focused (stay focused)
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head47Embed
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice (Dice)
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons (Fuck 'em!)
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power—how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit: I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise

If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go head and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it then real life’d it!
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch? I’m moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Muthafuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’mma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

Are you willing to give up what you love for who you love

That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til' you considered great?
How many missed calls til' you considered fake?
How many dreams before its considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes, you don’t know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say “in memory”
I’m praying that he make it, wishin' we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories…

Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I’m stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can’t purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I’m focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I’m marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I’m huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner’s circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan’
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal $20 bill right out her purses
No I ain’t perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die, of course I have the memories..
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo33Embed

Call it food for thought, put it on your plate
A friend of mighty Motown, home sweet home
Where I roam like a phone in the unknown zone

Catch me running to the money until my feet lose feeling
Stack it wall-to-wall 'till it's leaking through the ceiling
Man, all fucking hundreds so whats that like a zillion?
Working graveyard shifts cause were finna make a killin'
Went from intern to the owner of the building
Bustin nuts counting money like: "Oh what a feeling!"
To be seeing what I'm seeing
After I've seen what I've seen
It's like acting out a scene from a dream of my dream
I got a dream that's worth more then my reality
And pride that's worth more than a salary
And a text from the girl I love I stopped calling
Quote: "I hope it's worth all it"
Sometimes I feel I'm working just to work harder
And then work harder then who worked the hardest
Man the life of a work-a-holic
You either on your work or just working on it


Man fuck it kill'em all we gonna need a ton of flowers
And if you need impossible give me 'bout an hour
It's time to turn a Polaroid into a portrait
Rocking street clothes getting money like I'm corporate
Youngin' getting it isn't life gorgeous?
Bet the crib on 'em and you'll end up with a fortress
And Ima need that new condo, town home, brown stone
Should I fuck with the Dow Jones?
Or maybe I'll put money on the block instead
There's no need to save
I could get change off the street next to the meter maid
Cause I need a main house with a piece of shade
Butler doing such a good job that they need a raise
Bad chick with an Angel ass and an Aalyiah face
Tryna show a little TNA
Hell yeah I'm tryna see the day
Man, life is so bright when you don't see the grey
The new school appointed me to lead the way
A real nigga to the DNA
Me, Mike, Grace, and Dilla
Sticking to the script
And what's-her-name still licking on my tip
Go ahead and tell these bitches who they're fucking with
Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Her mouth lookin like Dannon
Because of me and Cannon
And to get where we at she had to suck a hundred dicks

Getting to the paper like it's human nature
Goddamn, the more they hate us, that just motivate us
I know revenge tastes the sweetest, mmm, I'm gon' savor

Just know I want this shit more than whatever it is you want from me
And the only thought at night that comforts me is starvin' whoever's huntin' me
Shit, lucky me, to be rich in a world where nothing's free
And separated from hell by one degree
Surrounded by niggas who did first degree
And the other ones that never got they first degree, sheesh
Lucky me (Nigga!)
Yeah, I done slashed hoes like I'm Slash on some rock star shit
Even bought Slash old crib, that's rock star as it gets
And have my hands on the R&B legends you couldn't handle
Whether you do music or not, you wish you could sample
And I had to live through the scandals
Public humiliations and breakups on camera
It's a living nightmare when your dream girl has to get canceled
And you gotta delete all the photos and shit like you never Instagrammed it
And you get off-track but somehow you gotta stay transit, ha
Man, lucky me
I was diagnosed with a heart disease at 19
Could barely stand on my feet
Doctors said they had to cut it open, put a pacemaker on it to put it back on beat
'Til my mama took me to holistic doctors and they prescribed me magnesium for two weeks
Went back to the regular doctors and they said, "Huh, damn, looks like we don't need to proceed"
That's how I know that western medicine weak
Man, lucky me, to be the chosen one
And saved for the special occasions like I was Opus One
You know, and I'ma live forever like Walt Disney, the frozen one
Done flew so many times past the limit, I didn't even know it was one
And face our problems head-on when they told us to run
And ran it up in a city where no one would come
When I had literally died but then came back alive
And it's the furthest thing that I know from over and done
And I don't even have to say it, you know where I'm from, bitch (Yeah, yeah)
Lucky me, lucky who? (Lucky) Lucky, true
It's a wonder what prayer, working smart and love can do
And y'all got an efficient and humble crew
And you got a long list of the things y'all wanna do
Shit, who knows, lucky me could turn into lucky you
We turned nothing to something so much it's nothing new
I know lady luck so well, I swear that's like my bottom bitch, number two
Doing what we love and choose with lots to lose and more to prove
Ain't running from nothing but haven't lost sight of the finish line that we been runnin' to
Lil' bitch, this Detroit-fucking-2

Fuck your white flag, ho, I don't want no truce

Pretty melody I wrote will never get sang
Piece of paper that I started  thrown away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Why? 'Cause you made it that way
Yeah
Yeah, you made it that way
Ooh, yeah

I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games, now you're just
A lame who's **** (Crazy ass b—) outta luck
I almost wrote you a love song

She threw my watch out the window, chain in her hand
She running through the crib, finding anything she can
Now our relationship is not the only thing that's outta hand (Look)
She even called my mama like, "You need to get ya man
'Cause your son lying on me, I ain't trying to get a tan
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands
So I'm heading to the club tr—tryna find a man"
Bitch, you headed to the club tr—tryna find a man
What is you saying? Had hoes and passionate night gowns
But you the only one I imagine in white gowns
So where ya left hand, you should let me add a ring to it
Because Mr and Mrs Anderson just has a ring to it
She like, "Why you act like that to me (What?)
And walk right back, Mike Jack to me?
Every time we fall out I'll throw yo ass out
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me, what the fuck?

 ayy
I think you crazy, crazy, you need medication
You should calm down, you need meditation
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations (What the fuck)
About how I'm wrong without any explanation
At all before you say another nigga next up
I should call a maid down 'cause I messed up
But gave you what you need even on them shopping sprees
I would throw you paper like extra extra (Read all about it)
She said what if we reversed roles
And you was front row cheering at my first shows
And a couple dollars later and some Louis Vuitton clothes
I could fuck a couple niggas thinking that you wouldn't know?
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours
And since you thought I'd never do it it even hurt more
And I would lie about it, but you'd find out from the source
Whose word was more truthful then yours, fuck what you 
I’m so glad I didn’t ever pen it
Now you ain’t got nothing with your stupid name in it
And if I would’ve did it would’ve probably stay with ya
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling you did me all wrong
What would even make me wanna write you a song
So glad I moved on
Cause now I got a new guy thats turning me on
And the big ballot strings are about to get played
Pretty melody I wrote is about to get sang
A song about our love is going to see the light of day
Why?
Cause you made it that way
Oohhh, yeah you made it that way
Ohhhh oh yeahh, I was going to write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you’re just

Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me I’m all you need
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me it’s not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I’m all you need

Understand, I am
The renowned, newest talk of the town
When errybody talk and just keeps on talkin’ about
Westside! Tellin’ girls “You should call if you down”
And if my phone doesn’t ring, then leave it after the pound
Cause I be up in the air more than I do on the ground
My city is on my hat, and I’m wearin’ it like a crown (Westside)
You’re now rocking with somebody on their fuckin’ bidness
Watch me do it big, no pun intended (Boi)
See, I done seen nights turn to days
Love turn to hate, hugs turn to laids
Niggas turn to sirs, Andre to Spades
‘Cause when it turns real, that’s when everyone turns fake
Instead of saying "fuck all of y’all" and turning away
Man, I was cool enough to say “Fuck it” and let ‘em stay
Fuck, I hate to say I told you so
So buying rounds is my way of saying “told you, ho”

My new watch, or the chick that’s standin’ right next to me
Killin’ niggas at rap, but being the man’s my specialty
I love shitting on all my exes especially
Double shots, then reload
Let’s toast to the interns that made it to CEO
Boss player, collectin’ every single check that’s owed out
Puttin’ on a show until everything is sold out
Man, I’m chillin’ with Jays, ‘Ye’s, and Common Senses
It’s crazy when legends are peers and your competition
I would hate to be a almost nigga
I call ya that, ’cause you gossip like y’all almost bitches
You know, went to school with Jay, and was almost Jigga
Or hooped against LeBron and would almost get ‘im
Y’all niggas make me realize how good almost isn’t
Would hate to look back on my life and say “I almost did it”
Fuck that, reflectin’ on the last chain I bought
They on my tracks, waitin’ on the next train of thought
Visualizin’ how the crown might be
Got the whole rap game tryna sound like me
Understand that what goes around comes around
And I don’t ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me it’s time to go

This dedicated to my ex girls, both of ‘em
It’s also dedicated to everybody who be talkin’ shit behind my back
And then when I see y’all, y’all act like “Awww, I’m so happy for you”
That’s some bitch-ass shit, nigga

Understand that what goes around comes around
(This also dedicated to everybody who’s fuckin’ winnin’ today)
And I don’t ever wanna come down

Look how good it is! I'll show you who you dealin with
Y'all illy? I'm iller, I'm from Illi-noise
Yo, Big Sean, why don't you call your Chi-Town boys?
Show me where they at, I will destroy
About to fuck somethin up, I might as well call the lawyer
G.O.O.D. Music run this bitch? Yes, we do
I know you thinking, "Damn, I wish 'Ye would bless me, too"
In the booth, I use the restroom—it's best you...
Gon' head and kiss the Jesus piece 'cause I just blessed you, ugh
And holy water, odds against Ye, it's slaughter
Ever since I opened up that Midnight Marauders
Now it's gon be a problem like a brand new installment
From the late, great Mr. Christopher Wallace
They call us pompous; can I be honest?
Honestly, modesty wasn't ever in my policy
Apology accepted, you ain't say it? Should've said it
As soon as I did it, all that bullshit was deaded

But I'm never going downhill, even on ski trips
I am the D, come and make an observation
It seem like the murder rate is higher than the population
Damn! I bet you just as sweet as you look, bitch
You are just Bushwick, I'm 8-foot-6
I'm so up-up on it like insomniacs
G.O.O.D. Music, man, 'Ye, where he find me at?
I'm so dominant, I'm so confident
That I'ma get a compliment on any fucking continent
From freaks that's fine as shit, without this designer shit
Big business, respect my conglomerate
Girls get check, but my bank get check more
Whenever niggas check up, I'm who they check for
Or have a check for; Louie V shit
So much Damier print, fuck around and play check-ors
And these rappers get critical damages
But I rap so good, it's no need for bandages
You the man in your city? Cool
When am I performing? Right after you
I'm sorry but you gone be ranked right after two
'Cause, I'm first place and second is my crew
So move, bitch! Yeah5Embed

Can't sing a lick, now she finna be a pop star, pop off
And I can't feel shit but my dick in your bitch
So guess what, there's only one thing left to pop off
Feelin' like a vegetable, with sexy hoes and sexy clothes
They best dressed, yeah I guess they recognize who they dressin' for
She step in the hall to call her man and say she just at home
But my hotel is Valentines, all you see is X and O's
And I can't feel my cardio
Motha fuckas walkin' in with shrooms, now I'm finna feel like Mario
Man I'm livin' with these niggas, fantasizin' life

I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

I do It
For the city, man

Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free-throwed in ice
Debating with the Reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my 23 years I've lived a couple lives
Like why? Cause I stunt? Bag the tree like it's fall?
The girls that was out of my league trying to play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard, and when my mama cried a river
They never gave us a bridge, they gave us a bridge card
Nigga riding low, puffing on loud
I came way too far to fuck it up now
Text from my mom said "Me and your grandma proud"
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me to get a job, save up for 401(K)
Man, I'd rather be young as shit counting 401k
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs

But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch, I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred I deserve
Throwing West side up like Pac up
Where they pop your block up, b-blocka big poppa flock off
You holy lil' whoaty holy kenobi chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I bet you that you won't find it
Rockin' Louis and MCM, I guess I'm clothes-minded
Obama suite, you one below up in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chilling where all your hoes hiding?
20k for the fit because it's 24 carats
I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-town repping
Making all these niggas who second-guessed regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
At least I realize now how much I love Ashley Marie
And when it's all said and done, I'll probably get on my knee
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man, she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy! Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy

I been this way before (And the whole world see me)
Dreamed of havin' so much more (Bitch I know you see me)
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day's a Friday and every night's a sex scene
Every week is Fashion Week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's angel, I even got red wings
Headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
It's prom night, and guess who's the prom king?
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring
Tell me that wasn't the verse of the year
Man, that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints be overstuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up! Man, I turn impossible possible
And what these niggas could barely see into optimal
The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do
Said I'm throwing my life away, if I drop out of school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything they told me not to do
After I went down the road they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
My old school look like a T-Rex: I should feed her fossil fuels
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules, lil' hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man they wanna see me dead, but I gave 'em dedication
And I'm yelling fuck 'em all with a hundred exclamations
Cause I'ma be the man til my fucking expiration
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

BIG, I do it, this goes out to my muthafucking city of Detroit
Westside to be exact, right over there on Northlawn

And turn these ideas to milli's, business into buildings
No girlfriend, you're looking for some feelings, find a dentist
Me and my crew toured around the world, shook a million hands
I never made the crowd fans, I made 'em all fam
And came back to the city that made us all men
Except we kings now, reflecting, trying to take it all in
I put the city on my back
So that way if I fall I'm crowd surfing the map

Said "I'ma leave town and bring back the whole world" (World)
So I bought a ticket (Boy), took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace and the first thing she said was
"It's too late"
Like, "Nigga, I got needs, too
I found a man who gave me what I need, now I don't need you
I barely got a text, a call back, you old lying ass nigga (Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
You a dog, out here chasing paper, fucking bitches, nah (The hell you talking about now?)
Nah, nigga, you too late (Fuck you, get out)

The last thing I wanna hear is too late
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, is it too late for me to try and change the world?
Is it too late to say I wanna change girls?
Is it too late even though I'm the shit?
Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick? Bitch

If I want it I need it if I need it I got it

I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was "bye" more, "fuck you"
"Who is that" and "I don't know why" more (Shut da fuck up)
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine

Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you

Okay, "B-I, B-I", bitch I do it to death
If I come with half, bet I leave with the rest
Okay, you might be cool getting 50%
I'm like "fuck you doing? I need Diddy percent!"
Got a million on line 1 and another mil' dialing in
Momma on line 4, telling me how much not to spend
'Ye on line 3 telling me how we 'bout to win
You on hold tryna get conferenced in
I ju- I just gotta have it
Imagine and make it happen, I prayed about it and grabbed it
My life is a fucking movie, the baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself to see who could get it the fastest
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink

Looking at her like "you never seemed so close"
I had a dream about a trillion in cash
It's time to make it happen!
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
Talking cash, you gotta fake an accent
I've broke enough tree down that I could make a cabin
Look: I turn all my problems to ash
All my wants into haves and then divided it by half
Pass it on to my man, write my will out then
Pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Bigs, greatest of all Seans
Sipping on shit older than me

Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go on and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life’d it
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch?
I’m moonwalking
And my middle name Michael, ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title, ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Motherfuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’ma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
These will be the best memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
You might also like
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til you considered great?
How many missed calls til you considered fake?
How many dreams til it's considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes
You don’t know how that shit feels mentally
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say in memory
I’m praying that he make it, wishing we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those will be the best memories

Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed

Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Mailed one when I heard Unique had died in that crash
Seems like yesterday I just seen her smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, light will swallow the dark
Hurtin' with my Mama looking at cribs we can't purchase
Houses bigger than the Palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles, I'm marathoning
To the money and you just running off in a circle
I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purses
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die first then I have the memories
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back

I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

And I'm in love with the lights, the love
Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old
Table full of new hoes, champagne nuvo
My mind is on Venus, but my neck is on Pluto
I need a girl that look badder than my girlfriend
You know the ones that look badder than their girlfriends
Paparazzi try to pop Big since I'm in Cali
But I just hide my face doing a Errol Flynns
Hoody over my head, Jedi, Anakin
Looking like a BBC Louis V mannequin
She ain't got no man in em
She got no companion, she's Jenifer Aniston
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend
And again, and again
Pass it to my mans and them
Fucking all the baddest bitches in cities we're landing in!

What happens when it all falls
And the success is all gone
And is all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity!

Shit, I'm trying to get Benz too!

If it could take my whole family out to Rio?
No more repo
A depo, just speed boats
Jewelry all gold call me C3PO
Smoke so much, I gotta see 3PO
Cause I'm worldwide tour with me and my nigga Zeno
Most comfortable behind the mics like T.O
So I hate to lose my Mike like Tito

I hope they never try to tell me I'm leaving
Getting everything I want, then I've got my mom next
LA Reid sign checks right after the contract
I always have a crazy flow pockets was on radio
Active cause I guess I was active on a radio
Way back in high school, yeah nigga CT
Where I met my nigga Tone, Pat Piff, and CT
Came out of the slump nigga way before T3
Giving hoes the run around, we just call them track meets
It's funny now when I look back
Cause them times gave me the inspiration that the track needs2Embed
Ay, ay

And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

I play the keys, handle dope, Barry Manilow
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet like cantaloupe
Hit the road, key of coke in the manifold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Japanese denim, down south numbers
Hit it once, trust it'll make a fat fiend stumble
Do the speed limit, Argo shoes
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too
I'm tippin' strippers but I call it penny pinchin'
She talkin' shit but I can get her titties lifted
My new crib got its own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it

Walked the mud jungle where they grinded out the leaves
So they swarm to my honey comb, hideout for the bees
You know what this sound like, money counters' sound bites
Machine gun fire, name ringin' through the town like
Church bells ringin', know what he was found like?
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees, I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
The Iron Man Audi, let the top striptease
My life's in slow motion, but the watch screamin' freeze
Ugh, young nigga gettin' money
The feds' dragnet couldn't take nothin' from me
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
What follows is a hundred of 'em, wrapped like a mummy

Man when Blade died my city cried a hundred nights
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred tight
Every wrong I do I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
Got her for cheap, compare the price
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White
And don't worry 'bout the info
From where they rob Pintos and could afford Enzos
Cause everybody knows keys open doors, but bricks open windows
Counting a hundred hundreds, more by more
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor
Talk shit, I'll send 'em door by door
Made for the Snow White like 4 by 4s

Mother fuck drinkin' and drivin', I'd rather get high and fly

Nigga, never did I slip or I panic, even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie, I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie, making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed, so fuck is my ransom, homie?

Big is on the track, Ye be on the track
Since when Kobe and LeBron hoop for the same team
Could live my life blindfold
Cause every time my eyes close
I just tend to fuck around and see the same thing
Yeah, I just tend to see the same thing
They say it's meant to be when you sleep to the same dream
I hooked up with GOOD, and been living a changed scene

Put me on a pedastal, but if I lost it all

Swear to God, eat a dick and everything that's edible
And I can't save everything and all

Fuck rap, I'm a street legend, block love me with a deep reverence
I was birthed in a C-section
Hella cops and police presence
We got opps so we keep weapons, we on y'all block while y'all eat breakfast
A lot of shots, we broke street records
Watch how you talk, I got reflexes, watchin' your cheap necklace
Then we slide out the East exit
But every time we get to fuckin' niggas up, TMZ catch it
Y'all still learnin' street lessons?
From the mastermind, first you master grind, then your team catch it
This time it’s for the money, I don't need credit
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it, look

Fuck rap, I'm a street legend
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it
Block love me with a deep reverence (Yeah, woah)
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it (Yeah)

And I got pressure on me
Seven days a week, it's game seven on me
Life'll test you out, you live through that, that's testimony
Givin' them hell, but how in the hell I got all these blessings on me?
Most of the girls I know addicted to social media
All the time they put in, they could've wrote encyclopedias
Mama said it only takes one time to fuck up your whole Wikipedia
And as your son, I can see the type of light that you see me in
After what happened to Nipsey, I reached out to Kendrick
It wasn't even no real issues there to begin with
Lack of communication and wrong information
From people fueled by their ego, it's like mixin' flames with diesel
Energy crazy, I realized that it's a two-way street
What's comin' is goin', if it don't give you more, it drains you
Should be a billionaire based on the time off I'm not takin'
Probably why this shit with me get crazy and we lost a baby
And everybody around me think I'm the one
But we all just one of ones, and I'm walkin' out the crib
They ask me where I'm goin', I told them, "I'm going on another ten-year run"
Niggas is bangin' over blocks that they don't own, thinkin' that's home
Boy, you think that's where you from? You don't really know where you from
You don't how deep your roots is or what your ancestors had done
So, God bless all of the sons and daughters
Who knew they history so they knew where to take it farther
And all the ones that stuck with me like good barbers
Lookin' at my life story, God's a good author
Never was the loudest in the room, we move like ninjas
And if it cost your peace of mind, it might be too expensive
So I can't give you everything that you want from me for free though
Get you one shot in life, you might not be able to reload
So advanced, I need all my advances
Bro hit me up for cash like we didn't have the same chances
My dad hit me up like, "Why I don't live in a mansion?"
I'm tryna focus, but baby girl keep holdin' my mind for ransom
And that ain't how it supposed to be, this man Hov got to a B
And his name Shawn too, I almost felt like it was me
Damn, I realized all my setbacks were inside of me
In high school, I learned chemistry, biology
But not how to cope with anxiety
Or how I could feel like I'm by myself on an island
With depression on all sides of me (Damn)
With a Glock seventeen right on the side of me (Hol' up)
Look, I ain't think I had the thought of suicide in me
Until life showed me all these different sides of me
Too many times I thought the reaper was outside for me (Ooh)
And how the fuck it's people that never met me that hate me?
I wonder if they understand that I meditate daily
And feel like my life purpose is to give inspiration
Despite the hit songs that there's just no escapin'
That I take care of my family and beat the odds that were deadly
You hate that, that just reflects your lack of succession, bless 'em
If it ain't Nipsey blue, it's Detroit blue

To uptown they feel a nigga deeper than masseuses
The truth is I does this, spitting like I was toothless
Coming to you clearer than blueprints, I move in
They sleeping on me man and I ain't sheets
Bloodsuckers so I'm calling 'em leech
I gotta eat and I'm hungry like I skipped breakfast, where's the ketchup?
I'm tryna cop the Benz or Lexus for winter time
So I ain't gotta go head up to Enterprise
Just to get my ass up in a ride
But nigga's can’t see me like they born with tinted eyes?
To me you little so to see you I got squinted eyes
And I'm just tryna show all of y’all I'm a soulful dude
Compared to me you got about as much sole as shoes
And soul is food, to prove this ask your chick
She all on my dick cause I push it like a pool stick

Hoodie over my head, recognize a Jedi
If I go too fast down this road I end up like Left Eye
I’m wondering would it be better if I left life
My girlfriend know I got a fetish for fine hoes
I'm worldwide so she know I’m gonna find hoes
Sneaking in my iPhone, looking through my call log
It hurts looking at her face to ask her what she crying for
I’m so fresh I’m wondering "why didn’t I design clothes?"
This rap shit is something that you gotta be designed for
Meetings at the label saying they gon' make Sean blow
Turned the radio on and do I hear Sean? No
Man please do not gimmick me, put me on the shelf and not remember me
And treat me like a John Doe
I wish that I could drop my nuts in they tonsils
(ahem) Shut up bitch swallow
And I been signed to Ye for well over a year now
It’s clear now, I'mma focus on my career now
You taught me to create a process
Saying that you changed my life dog it’s me being modest
But honestly I wish that I could take you off tour
Put you in the studio so you could focus more on my shit
And I don’t mean to sound selfish
But I am not an artist that's selfless

That’s just tryna get it crackin'

But I don’t know if I believe in love to be honest
Cuz every girl love the headliners
Take her to my hotel all my niggas there
And best believe they gon' give us all a hair line-up
And that’s why girls wanna leave us
Tell 'em where we are but they never gon' believe us

That's why the avenue where I grew up was 8 Mile and Hoover (What?)
'Cause it sucked like a Roomba
But even if I would've went the indie route
I don't have any doubt
I would still get blown like it's windy out
Shoot 'til the clip is emptied out
This is the beginning of the ending, but I'll put another clip in and spit these rounds
If I dig deep down when I'm in my bag like Fendi
Who am I offending now?

But I should say bye-bye, earthlings
'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this "Grindin'" beat, yeah
I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song
You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart
So when I'm rippin', it's hard to tell whether if it is really because
Of how offensive I am, or just what a bitch that you are
Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul
Like I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and I'm quick on the draw
Yeah, so when I pull it, surprise (Pull it, surprise), like Kendrick Lamar
You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog
'Cause y'all are missing a heart
Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz
This shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping
Y'all got detention tomorrow
I'm severe like Benzo withdrawal
Bitch, your skin's gonna crawl
I'm invincible, I've been through it all

Hey, this is Stevie
I was blessed to be raised in the west side of Detroit
I lived on Breckenridge, that was the first home that we lived in
My neighborhood, where I was raised up
When the girls came around, I would sing
On the front porch, beating on the stairs and singing
For hours and hours upon hours
Seeing a piano for the first time
But the amazing thing as well is
Through those experiences, I was able to understand how
My being blind because my mother allowed me to be free
Didn't mean that I had to be blind to the world
I may have had a visual disability
But did not stop my vision inside me
I didn't know what it was like being poor
Because God had made me rich
Even before I was born
Rich with the spirit of knowing that
Anything you imagine that's for the good is possible to be a reality
Because a few weeks before I was discovered, I-
I had a dream that I heard my music, my record on the radio
I had nothing out, no one knew who I was, and, um
Amazing, it really happened
And so you know, it's just, it's...
I- I- I can say to other young people as I said to my son Kailand
I said, "Listen, what you don't understand
Is that God gave you a brand even before you were born
All you had to do in life is walk into it."You might also like10Embed

She just happy she chosen
But she the one who chose me, that's what's more important (Woah)
I give her more game than problems, she love how I coach her
Under unrealistic measures is the only way you can measure who's chosen
I realized my mind frame is too big for the portrait
That's why I'm steady tryna teach the whole hood corporate
Off psychedelics while a psychic tryna read my fortune
But I know knowing too much of anything can be a torture (Yeah)
She like, "You supposed to meet my parents, you know that's important"
How narcissistic you think I am? Huh?
You think I did when I didn't (What?)
You think I paid for everything and didn't pay attention
Like my head is as big as my name (Come on)
Just tell a real nigga once, baby, never again (Swerve)
And I'll put you and all my loved ones on like it's my only obligation

So you gotta understand if they don't see where you comin' from or if they small-minded
And not thinking that it's enough for all of us to get it
That's why it's important to be your own boss
To some capacity you know, put yourself in control
Through the ups and downs, wins and losses, they all just chapters
Chapters in your life story and really
Some losses teach you how to win you know
Some losses teach you more than always winning ever could (Yeah, ayy)
And I been there back against the ropes, against the wall
(I ain't tryna waste nobody time, don't waste mine)
That's just 'cause you the one that can handle it, you know?
Shit man, you gotta prove yourself
You gotta rise the fuck up (Up)

You ain't gonna give me a way? Okay, cool

Detroit 2, ayy, what's fuckin with that, huh?14Embed
There's never been a single time
Not a, not a-one, that I've been to Detroit
Where it wasn't some kind of adventure
City is fucking crazy, it's like, it's palpably alive
It's an entity, it's not like just a place you go
It's Detroit
And one of the reasons that Detroit is my favorite market
Is because the audiences in Detroit, for a comedian
I find them to be particularly challenging
So when I go there, in this particular story
It seemed like a pretty bеnign night
And I'm sittin' in the dressing room at the Fillmorе
And there's an older gentleman in there
And I don't really talk to the guy much, but he was a nice guy
Cool energy, shit like that
And then, uh, famed Detroit rapper Danny Brown came in
Now at this time, I wasn't that familiar with Danny Brown's music
You know what I mean?
So when he asked me to smoke with him, I just smoked with him
I didn't hear all that "Adderall Admiral" and all that shit
I didn't know he was about that life (Haha)
I'm assuming it's weed, I don't know what the fuck it was
But, boy, I mean, I smoked weed a million times in my life
Never, ever remember feeling this way before
And as I was walking on stage, I told my road manager
"You know, my number's up tonight"
He's like, "What does that mean?"
"I'm going to bomb"
And true to my professional prescription, I did
But, there's bombing and then there's the shit that happens in Detroit
It's like, the crowd was with me
But the way the crowd responded to me widely
Was one of my favorite crowd interactions ever
And as the set is going terribly
When it's clear I'm not gonna be able to pull the nose up and I'm gonna have to crash this thing
I saw Danny Brown slipping out the room, which made me laugh really hard
Go back in the dressing room and everyone, you know there's a stink on ya after you bomb
Where everyone looks at you like, you know what I mean?
Like Headwound Harry, like, "Nigga, are you okay?"
But I really, I can't explain it to ya, I really didn't care
And then, and then, it turns out
That this kind older gentleman was Big Sean's father
And my goodness what the, the, he gave me a pep talk that only a dad could give
And it made me feel wonderful, man (Wow)

Who y'all talking to man?
It's Big Sean, aye check it out, check it out, aye
This song is dedicated to all my niggas, who be hittin' mad hoes
Thinkin' everything's sweet, nigga
Better watch out, before something creep up on yo' ass.You know?
D-Town what up?

B.I.G is, se is on this beat-is
Why is they in my shit?
I guess they used to being nosey like Kleenex
Cleanest, as the cleanest
Head, toe, to penis, that's why she on my dick
Petiteness but that ass fat
So I grabbed that, and we would kick it like hacky sack
And yup and she was all mine, I had the ass cat
Made her my girl and my world, might I add that?
And it's sad that
After a few years and a few tears it all ended, and that's that (So sad)
The love was real, that's what my hearts feelin'
And even though we split, was no hard feelings
I ran into her though a few months after
At the, corner of Main St. and Fifth Ave
Asked her, how she was, how's mama and papa?
She said, "Aw boy, you know that you all that they aska' 'bout
And I'm proud you doin' good as a rapper
It's nice to see you off the ground like NASA"
And then we started kickin', and reminescin' bout' times past when I smashed
She said, "Remember in the rain I giggled when it splashed?"
She came twice, I came last on the grass
And all that talkin' got me in the mood (The mood)
I wanna get that ass in the nude, (The nude)
So I invited her back to my condo
Pronto to continue this convo, 'cause I know
If I hit that ass then, shit I could probably hit it again
So, then we back at my place
And it was no time wasted, she was in my face
But when I reached for that magnum
Shit, that's when she got mad and said
"Sean I wanna feel you like I used to baby and not this plastic"
I said, "Bitch, it ain't like how it had been
I don't know where you had been, I won't end up like Magic"
I promised Mama I would never end up like Magic
And I don't care how good that ass is
And since I wanted to dick her out
It just hurt much more after I kicked her out, damn
I need a model chick, where's Tyra?
Or maybe Eva, she fina'
But then my nigga Tone hit me on the phone
Like "Dawg, pray to God you didn't bone yo' bro
I was talking to that chick I hit, You know Symone
Well anyway her and your old girl like sisters (For real?)
But I guess she ain't know you was my nigga
To make a long story short
Last week on the 4th, they both got tested
Got the results, she tested positive for genital warts
And, for all them times you made her life depressin'
She wanted to pay you bick witha' infection (What the fuck?)
Grab the weed, grab the cell
Call up my niggas, got a story to tell

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone

I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my stepbrother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, "Ain't too much that's different"
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white-out"
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you
It's all good, I love you grandma

You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life

You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home
Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong
You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone
Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends
I seen your ass up on TV,  touched up on them twins
You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz
Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, whoa
Niggas want handouts, and I only got two
Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you
Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit
Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew
Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do
Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through
So when it's time to travel management say I only need two
Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules
I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose
This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze
Lately, though my family been too happy
I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy
People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that
I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that
Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece
My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice
We supposed to be the role models
No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college

One mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad
And it's only one me, divide it and do the math

How am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said?
I don't even have time for everything in my head
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot

It can fuck you 'round, but your heart will never lie to you
And that’s why people love you, Sean
Because you talk to them from the heart
(Thanks, dad)
That’s why you're magical, Sean
It’s no mistake that you’re where you are right now
You speaking that from your brain, but they hear you from your heart
Because people can see your bullshit
And I know I’m talking a lot of shit
(No, you’re not)
But I want you to hear that
Because I’m a great motherfucker, man
And I’m very modest
You know, I am

Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep

You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish Stone Cold it

I got some miles on me, but it's cool cause I never give an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
Cause this shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times

Is it because he ain't got the tattoos? He ain't throwing up signs
Well, let me throw up mine
And also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish your lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time then cross it with pride
That's real, my nigga, remember that

Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing tennis
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change

Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga
And pray I don't see the end of my paper like P.S nigga
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass
And now we out of high school, you got a fatter ass
Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago
Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip
And you gave me that head
I swear to God that was the best night of my life
I can't even sit here frontin', lie and pretend
Dancing with your titties out
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah
But 5 minutes later you on my lap
And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here
You're telling me how you went down South for school
Down near TSU
But you know business majors
You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school
Told her check the Valley, seems like out there they be hiring
In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring
A new scenery might just be inspiring
She said "Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good"

Still living how I'm living cause nigga I need to
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it

Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing tennis
Some hoes are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change

She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top
Spending extra time when she ain't got it, on me
Then she turned around said
"I'm so proud, seems like everywhere I'm hearin' ya
Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria
Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask"
When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past
Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim
Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand
Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye
And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint
Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense
And he said "Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet"
Signed me, got a profit
Few years later yeah we on and poppin'
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in
Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it
Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it
Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody
Oh boy, swerve

Yeah yeah

Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back
I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that
And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that
Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating
Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it
Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs
And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings
And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk
Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed
What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?
Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this crossed
Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft
Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw
Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off
Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk
It be like "we don't got time for bullshit, dawg"
You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype
You look like the "um, you owe me" type
Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no
Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like
"Oh, you owe me likes"
Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em
The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em
The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em
I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD
And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first
No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy
Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know
But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um
White people with a black son
And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper
Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn
Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do
Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?
But what about now? 313

Come roll with a nigga, get high with a nigga
Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga
Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas
Back when Iceberg and Girbaud
Was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures
Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros
Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us
Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats
You know, spending gas money on everything except gas
Spending my last on the shit that won't last
Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass
A movie and popcorn and caress that ass
Overdress to undress that ass, god bless that ass
It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer
Riding around like we dumber on dumber
Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer
What happened to those days? I really do wonder
When all I did was safe sex, latex
The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade AIDS test fuck
But I ain't flunk once
Back before I got drunk once
I was smoking on haze, all in a daze
My homies would call and say, "nigga, come roll"

The D grown us to get it man. You know what I’m mean? Just hustle, hustle, hustle. They, you know we, you know, there really wasn’t that much opportunity for us, man. So, we just had to let our nuts hang and just, shit, boss up and, and learn the game

Cause there's niggas in the streets
Getting money under my nose that I must stash
I've seen people get murked who ain't deserved that shit
Cops should've protect-and-served and shit
But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit
Ask "why the attitude?" cause bitch, you deserve that shit
Bang bang bang, how do you maintain
A sane brain and mind in a city of AKs and K9s?
When only language they know English and gang signs
Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll

Well shit, I’m just, you know, I’m proud of lil' bro man. That nigga listened and he was able to stay focused man and through all the adversity man and through all the hood politics. But he seen it, he was with it, he was on it, you know? I mean like I say the Linwood man, shit that’s what we know the city man, that’s for the city man all fucking day

From the West but I'm heading to the Northside
That's the top, I need a crib on the shoreside
I need a backyard full court size
From where the judge is the only thing that's courtside
Chasing money in the city of crime
Cashback so then it's black bags under my eyes
Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep
To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats
Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone
They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!
I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on
Mama had two jobs I know that she was working for me
Ten years later, hired to working for me
Hired the whole family like mobsters
Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors
Grandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city
Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy
London or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney
Paris, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' man!
Texas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy
All the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me
Heading to the money, whole city coming with me
And I'mma rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!

Hey, what's up?
It's your boy MC Serch, talking about my man, Big Sean
You know, first time I met Big Sean, it was at the Kanye concert
With NERD and Keri Hilson and, um
He was just mad cool, he came up to me
Real big chain, lotta ice on his neck
I thought he was gonna have an ego
"Yo Serch, I'm Big Sean, big fan
I just wanna say, 'What's up'
You know I'm signed to G.O.O.D. Music"
It was mad cool and my wife and kids were with me
And my wife turns to me, she goes, "Who's that?"
I said, "Oh, it's Big Sean, you know, he's signed to Kanye"
She said, "Wow, he's a good kid"
I was like, "Yeah, nah, definitely a grown man"
And then he comes to the show and he's just- he killed it
He kills it off the head, he kills it free-styled
You know, it just shows why he was signed
Why Kanye signed him, man, he's a good dude
And I really hope he has the impact I believe he's gonna have
In upcoming years, in this-this culture
And in hip hop, so make sure you pay attention

You need a good guy and I'm already not one

If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hardtop
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up
Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise so my dawg can quit wearing
A .44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping "Ready or Not"
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class wherever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive
Fuckin' right

Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold

Seems life's never at a standstill, even in a photo
Thinking about the ex-girl, I hoed though
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like, why don't schools teach more mathematics?
Less trigonometry and more about taxes?
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life instead of lab rat us?
With a mansion that's about five floors
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got five more
With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for
And at the same time remind me what I'd die for
A world where you wouldn't need sleep
That way we could catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speedboat my dad always wanted
Mm, I swear I feel it coming
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world (Cole World)
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world (Cole)
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world (Cole World)

Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace to society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy
Switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)
Style on Nadal, I've been serving y'all lately, cheddar on Federer
Ball till I fall, et cetera, et cetera
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls

My, my, my, as the world turns
Today if I don't earn, best believe I'm gon' learn
If I can't do either or, shit it's none of my concern
Watch my enemies burn as I fulfill every yearn, ah
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to
The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too
The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too
Niggas seven feet, telling me I'm who they look up to
Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up
Don't invite 'em to my shows but always still manage to show up
Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion (Whoa)
And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be votin'
So when you step inside my office, treat that bitch like it's the Oval
El presidente, lord, sensei
Do ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting risqué
Crazy nigga, they ain't seen it like this since 'Ye, yeah
Well, this the life that I live
Collecting everything overdue for all the work that I overdid
D-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I'm Oprah, kid
Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist
'Cause when you come from the bottom, man, it's so hard to just get a glimpse
So hard to get a glimpse, so while I'm here I might take a pic
And show 'em that it's more to the world than tryna make a living
Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it
Okay, como me llamo
She say, "Ingles, no hablo," man, unless it's eat me out, though
Benihana, my McDonald, all black leather jackets
While I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I'm Keanu
Wishing Lamborghinis made a five do'
'Cause I got too many real ma'fuckers I ride for, die for, uh
Straight out the metropolitan
My city need a hero, so I treat it like Metropolis
And it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can't name
Even though I'm me, Lord knows that I can't save
But I'm still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch
I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain't rich
Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man, we ain't make shit
From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge
And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate
Man, we was tryna get away, man, we was tryna get ordained
And damn, tomorrow never seemed so close
And life ain't what it seem no mo'
'Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast
A million dollars never seemed so broke
And every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with
And niggas suin' me and they just banking on the settlement
Never settlin', life is too fast just to settle in
So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement
Like damn

Not to listen to what you hear from the OG's
Rollin' OG 'til I G-O
Yeah G-O, nigga, add an O-D
That's what I rep, nigga, 'til I O-D
Collecting everything that this world owes me
I told my Momma grab you any kind of car

Couple niggas on a hit list and bitches on a different type
Same shit, different nights, 'til I live a different life
"Sean, you lookin' tired," damn, homie, that's all?
I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I ain't goin' bald
Haters prayin' I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hatin'
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin' like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleepin' with that MAC and I ain't talkin' 'bout computer love
Owe the wrong people, you a price tag
Now you pray to God, hopin' that you got a Christ tag (God)
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Take a elevator straight up out the slums to a penthouse view

Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me

Summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a—I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died
For the rights for me to survive but those who lied
To the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me

The Devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important, the end is near

While she can still smell 'em, if you love somebody please tell 'em
I swear if you had 24 hours tell me who or what you'd do
Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get high with your crew?
Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?
Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?
Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid?
Would you try to pay your dues?
Would you step it up or would you try and trade shoes?
Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?
Would you, hit the bar and go binging?
Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benzin'?
Would you die alone, would you die independent?
Or would have your friends right there in attendance?

Guess that depends on how you live

Yeah, it's so cold in the muthafucking D. I'm talking 'bout real cold mane. I'm talking 'bout June 19-mothafuckin'-86, on the West Side off 8 Mile Road, living with my pops while he was working at a mufuckin' post office. Right around the corner, I was working at McDonalds, getting up in the morning doing that breakfast shift. I was so cold on the mothafuckin' eggs, they called me Young Eggs, mane. I mean I had it locked and loaded. I was gon' fuck around and go to school out there too. The coaches wanted me to come to Cooley High and play basketball and do my thang. But you know what man, the experience I had in Detroit was a hell of an experience because it shaped me, it molded me, it grew on me. I came back from Detroit, I was new and improved. I remember I wrote me a song. I said uh, "I went to Detroit to make my move. I'm on track, now I'm back, and I'm new and improved." That's how I came back from Detroit, you understand me. I was new and improved. So all my folks out there in the D, it's so mothafuckin' cold from the West Side to the East Side. Y'all know what it is. I used to stay on Whitehill Street on the East Side too, right by the Eastland Mall, ya dig. So I mean I'm well rooted and tooted and suited and booted. Part of the D is part of the G and the LBC. This is Big Snoop Dogg. Big Sean, you know what it is. Detroit! Let's goYou might also likeEmbed

That I'm 'nikcuf around through her or her friends (what?)
Then she gon' leave like leaves in the winter
Meaning she cold
She hear about me and the twins that had on the twin skirts
Hit squirt hit the purp
And that bitch had the nerve to call out my name when my girl hit my chirp
"Hello?" Oh — that's just my cousin Kim
Her and her friends stopped by for a min
"Nigga, you over there lying AGAIN?!"
Damn. I know she ain't finna believe
