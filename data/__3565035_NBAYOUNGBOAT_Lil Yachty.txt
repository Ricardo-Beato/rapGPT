Wop, skrrt
(Skrrt, skrrt)
Wop, wop
(Skrrt-skrrt, skrrt-skrrt) I don't know what you take me for ho (Lil Boat, wop, wop)
I ain't goin' for it (Wop)

Young nigga, rich nigga, I'm a bad bitch getter
Fuck nigga, ho nigga, I don't fuck with broke niggas
Always held my own since I jumped up off the porch, nigga
You ain't know, now you know, nigga, Hi-Tech pour a four, nigga

Bitch run me my sack before I come in
80,000 dollars plus a jet on a backend
20 twin twins finna get plucked like a chicken
Brother locked up, he spent much time in the kitchen
We ain't really with none of that pretendin' and shit (—tendin' and shit)
I got six Catholic hoes in here sinnin' and shit (Sinnin' and shit)
Pour that shit up, bust it down (Woo)
Bought a new crib, it got several amenities (Gang)
You gon' get shot like the Kennedys (Yeah)
Fuckin' with Lil Boat and YB (Doot, pew)

Carbine it sound like a dump truck (Trra)
Soon as I up, he gon' back up (Boom, boom)
She wanna fuck, I'ma smash her (Smash)
He want a verse, I'ma tax him (I'ma tax him)
Say you want smoke, it ain't 'bout nothing
I know that nigga ain't 'bout nothing (He ain't 'bout it)
Bring out the boat when the flood coming
Strapped with a TEC when you pull up on me
You might also like
I'm with the .38 baby, my neck see more water than the Navy (Gang)
I was finna fuck your bitch, my nigga then I got lazy (Ugh)
I saw your new watch, that shit cool but my shit crazy
Canary yellow diamonds in my mouth like I bit a daisy (Yeah)
I'm with Lil Baby, yeah, keep a .380, yeah (Pew-pew)
I'm with big Slime, yeah, you know we goin' brazy, yeah (Slatt)

17 with four babies, yeah
Lotta money, know they hate me, yeah
One on four, they try to play me, yeah
Shoot his ass right up in here (Pew-pew, pew-pew)
Diamonds, they shine like a headlight (Shine)
I keep that lil' bitch if her head right
I'ma lay up and fuck on her every night (Every night)
When I'm leavin' I'm headin' straight to the flight (No)
Got a tiger but no I'm not Mike Tyson (Mike Tyson)
Scuff in the club like Fight Night (Fight Night)
I make that lil' ho act right (Act right)
I tell that bitch fuck up my sack right (Bitch)

Put that lil' bitch on a Spirit flight (Gang)
Return her next to me one night (Nyoom)
We running and ducking from squad lights (Woo)
I got 32 shots in the gun fight
These niggas sweet like a honey bun (Sweet)
Don't worry 'bout where my money from
At the crib, on the couch, we got huntin' guns (Doot)
Dissect his hand from his other arm (Doot, doot, doot)
Young nigga, rich nigga, I'm a big bag getter (Woo)
Bitch nigga, snitch nigga, never met a real nigga (Bitch)
Never had six figures, my bitch do tricks nigga
I go by Lil Boat and I'm coolin' with some real hittas (Gang)
Whip on the wrist, that's a brick on the fist, nigga
No light needed for this chain, it's gon' glist nigga (Yeah)
VS, one stone, that shit not far from flawless
Fuck a pretty bitch, nigga, my money gorgeous, bitch
