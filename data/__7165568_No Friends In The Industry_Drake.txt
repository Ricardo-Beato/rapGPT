No friends in the industry
My brothers been my brothers, man, you niggas ain't no kin to me, a fact (Woah)
Yeah, you heard about me, you don't know me more than that
Yeah I know I—
Hey, hey, yeah

No friends in the industry
My brothers been my brothers, man, you niggas ain't no kin to me, a fact (Woah)
I was known for snappin' when I chat before the app
Stood on everything I said and never took it back (Woah)
No friends in the industry
I had to draw the line between my brothers and my enemies, a fact
Niggas love to start the beef, don't wanna keep it rap
Yeah, he hit us up and now we owe you something back
See, I was young angel but these niggas turned me evil
Yeah, I know I know you, but you really ain't my people
Yeah, I heard some people say they know 'em as my equal
Truth be told, I son these niggas, girl, I don't compete with 'em
Ask about The Boy and they gon' say they got the streets with him
Niggas so offensive knowin' they don't have no defense
Why they always act like we can fix it with a meeting?
All that linking up, man, I'ma see ya when I see ya
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, brothers been my brothers, man
You niggas ain't no kin and that's a fact (Ayy)
And I'm like Sha'Carri, smoke 'em on and off the track (Aye)
And you love that hoe, but me, I put her on her back
You get Drizzy on a track, he'll put you on the map
Oh, it's like that? Hell yeah it's like that (Ayy)
And I got a contract, it's a max (Ayy)
SInce I got in contact, she attached
When I signed my first deal, that shit came through a fax
That should let you know how long I been out here runnin' laps
(I been doin' this for a long time)

(Ayy, what?)
Damn, this shit too dirty, gotta yellow tape it
And I got her waitin' at the telly naked
We ain't drop though, how you niggas celebratin'?
Already disrespecting, something I ain't tolerating
You niggas fuck with me, I give 'em motivation
And your circle shrinkin', see some boys escapin'
Rest of them is guilty by association (Ayy, what?)
Fuck debatin' who the goat
Bet not make the shit up 'bout the numbers all I know
Bet not make the shit up 'bout the summer all I know
Better find ya someone else to hit with all that smoke, nigga, yeah
And all them tweets and all them posts
Ain't got the type of time to be playin' with you folk
I had a Richard prior to these niggas, that's the joke
I'm really down to die behind these verses in my notes
Yeah
