(Yeah, check me out)
(Wait)

I'd do anything to make you smile, bitch
Travel ’round the world and come back home and now my style switched
They say I get spicy when I step out, this ain't mild shit
I hit that last night and she already feel nostalgic
Five hunnid thousand
Just for me to hit my little dance, then I'm bouncing
You know that the bread keep coming, Golden Corral, bitch
You know that the head keep coming ’cause she's a down, ooh

Nice dress but your birthday suit's a better outfit
Mic check (Can you hear me now 'cause I just doused it?)
I'm Jack but I came up with the fucking fountain
My OG's move a mountain, I'm cutting up like a Shaolin

I'm bouncing, I think I need somе counseling
I’m bouncing, I think I need some— (Think I need some—)
I’m bouncing, I think I need somе counseling
I'm bouncing, I think I need some— (I think I need some—)

Travel 'round the world and come back home and now my style switched

I hit that last night and she already feel nostalgic
Five hunnid thousand
Just for me to hit my little dance, then I'm bouncing
You know that the bread keep coming, Golden Corral, bitch
You know that the head keep coming ’cause she's down—

I'ma fuck the earrings off of you
I'ma check my schedule and then clear it all for you
Look up at the ceiling, yeah, that mirrors all for you
Know I love them curves and how they veering off of you
I'ma grip that body power steering off of you
You know you a star, that's why they cheering all for you
You my lil' muse, get these lyrics all for you
And then I sing 'em like an Ed Sheeran song to you
'Cause I love the shape of you, hmm, you, you, you
I mean the memory is nice but I would love a tape of you
You, you, you, you, you
I got so much that I want to say to you
I'd do anything to make you smile
Take you to the Panama Canal
Hotels five star like they play for Coach Cal
But they call me Young Pitino 'cause I'm good in both towns4Embed
