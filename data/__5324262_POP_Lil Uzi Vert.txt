Straight bars
Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bah (I'm working on dying)

Got a bitch, yeah, she look so good
But on the real, she in denial
Diamond water, yeah, it look like a river
Look like I'm standing in the Nile
If you really didn't get the last line
Then your level on the brain of a child
Pay attention, better do the right thing
Or your pussy ass still workin' at Sal's

I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna top (Yeah)
Man, she going dumb, she don't stop
Put it in her mouth, make her jaw lock
Hellcat faster than your whip stock
So why would I tell you 'bout the whips that I got?
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna top (Yeah)
Man, she going dumb, she don't stop
Put it in her mouth, make her jaw lock
Hellcat faster than your whip stock
So why would I tell you 'bout the whips that I got? (Yeah, let's go)

Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop that ass, pop that ass, do the dash
I be runnin' out of gas
Every time I go to the mall just to pop the tags
I don't really cop nothin' at the mall
First time at the mall, copped it all
Said, "A hundred thousand," so I dropped it all
And that wasn't my whole bankroll
Body roll, waist roll, waist roll
Make a bitch do what I say so
Waist trained, got a bitch, taste just like ice cream
Read her text, she said, "Girl, I scream"
Shot a nigga with a 17
Lil Uzi, yeah, I'm from the 16
Got a million, no Christine
Neck gleam, wrist gleam, fist gleam
Lil' nigga but I'm doin' big things
You ain't ever seen a nigga this clean
Pants cost two K, big jeans
And my shoes cost like sixteen
Hunnid, nigga, that's just what I bleed
Turned a dead nigga to a blunt of weed
And that last boy taste like Reggie
'Cause I just lit up Philly
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna top (Let's go)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Let's go)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Let's go)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop (Let's go, let's go)
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna top (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Uh-huh)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Ew)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna top (Yeah)

Multi bitches
Multi, multi, multi, multi, multi-grain on my granola bar
Got a multi, multi, bow tie when I rock my Dior
Multi, multi, multi, multi, multi-million dollar deals (Let's go)
I'ma keep it real
Armstrong, marathon when I'm on a bike like my name Mill (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
I can make her kneel, beggin' on her knees
Beggin' me please, so she can see the deal
I ain't never lackin', I ain't never love her
Been alone from little boy so I don't need your opinion
I been gettin' money, nigga, I been gettin' plenty
I can fuck your bitch, make her bounce on a Bentley
I was on a Perky 30, she was on the Henny
Wait, she was fuckin' you, who? Your cousin Vinny?
That boy rat, he mouse, she Minnie
Fuckin' that bitch and now she tryna spin me
No, and this is no Iovine, not talkin' 'bout Jimmy
Kill these niggas every day like they Kenny
If you want money, back Crawford like Cindy
And if you want more, then you better get near me
I flex on my haters, pull up, threw a fifty
Yo' bitch on my dick and her breath smellin' minty
I went to the store and got me some Vetements
Some Pradas, Balenci', Balenci', Balenci'
I spend it all on that lil' bitch
Balenci', Balenci', Balenci', Balenci', Balenci'
Balenci', Balenci', Balenci', Balenci', Balenci'
Balenci', Balenci', Balenci', Balenci', Balenci'
I'm movin', I'm drippin', got sauce and I'm swaggin'
'Cause it easy with your bitch on me, no, you can't kiss me
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna top (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna top (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna pop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga make your bitch wanna drop (Yeah)
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna top (Yeah)

Pop, pop
I'm working on dying
Drop, drop
What the fuck?
