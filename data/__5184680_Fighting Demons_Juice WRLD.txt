Run away
In fear of me dying today

Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days

Chip, chip, cheerio, everything's all good, right?
I got rich, I got rich, I'm livin' that fast life
Couple M's in my bank account, I got cash, right?
And that's supposed to make me happy
I got a couple questions
How come that shit don't ever make me happy?
Money give me an erection
But that don't mean it's gon' be everlasting
Yeah, I know it's a blessing
But how come it always feel like the devil plottin'
And the devil watchin'?
He see me buyin' all these watches
Benjamin Franklin in my pockets
Ooh, been a year of the glitz and the glam
And the TV channels, brain's going scramble
Scrambling sometimes 'cause this shit is hard to handle
Demons in my heart (Yeah), they destroy me like a vandal (Ah)
You might also like
Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up

Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days

Karma ain't what you think it is
Super stressed, still handle all of my business
Do the best I can, yes, I can
Yes, I am, misfortune
I know in the dark, they be lurking (Why?)
Same way they lurk in your head when they get in your mind
You don't wanna know what they're tryin' to find
I'll protect your soul (Ah)
Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up

Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days48Embed
