7 ContributorsSports Center Lyrics
Yo, this shit feel like Sports Center
Nothing but highlights, some ballers
Jumping out the mother fucking gym
So Designer Flow
It's your uncle Snoop Dogg
Let me show you how we keep the trap jumpin' on the West Side
The best side

McDonald's all American
There's really no comparing it
I play some D and pop a three and fly up in the air again
First-round draft pick came in with this rap shit
Get a lot of moolah to keep you a bad bitch
Those were the rules, I aimed for the full pie
Took a slice and now I'm popping at the bull's eye
I'm equivalent to excellence
With my weaponry, I'm stepping while I'm rapping it
Now could I should I would I do things your way
And end up dead or in jail? My nigga no way
It's like some good hot head with no foreplay
I won't be caught so I cut you like I'm OJ
Kingpin Nietzche
Designer Flow hand me the ball young dawg I need a heat check
Reset, he wet
Dikembe Mutombo, that we shit
Get reject, we all stars baby
So you never get what we get

Nowadays nigga killing over nothing
Rep a gang cause they wanna be part of something
I been in my own lane since I was a youngin'
Whole family had a bag, I'm the plug's cousin
But I found my own plug, the ain't front me nothin
But my nigga Black did give me that Gucci belt (black)
This where I put my heat I never leave it on the shelf (strapped)
My heart froze I don't ever leave it on my sleeves (nah)
I got hoes I ain't never met a bitch I need
So when she tell me that she leaving i'm a let her leave
My aroma in her room ain't gon' let her breathe
Got it smelling like some money and a couple g's
It's on record I could smash who I want
Put this on record never asked for a front
Put this on record twenty bands this month
Put this on record, put this on record
Trap jumping like a ball player

In the trap I do my best to help em out
And all some niggas ever did was fuck up the count
And all some niggas ever did was run they fucking mouth
Had to keep it moving had to keep my head up
Had to re-up and recoup to get my bread up
Had to take a nigga boo and put her legs up
Her nigga probably do the same with my main thing
Still ride with the flag for the gang gang
I'm a real trap nigga, I don't gang bang
I done been across the map with the propane
They'll point a nigga out get your old man
Put the noodle in her mouth like the low mein
Kill a nigga with a strap like a gay bitch
Made a band in a minute off 8 sips
Tried to walk away from trapping but I can't quit
Trap jumping like a ball player
Trap jumping trap jumping like
Trap jumping like
Trap jumping like a ball player
Trap jumping trap jumping like
Trap jumping like
Trap jumping like a ball player
Trap jumping trap jumping like
Trap jumping like
Trap jumping like a ball player

Born center
Say holla at real when i'm in the trap
All across the map
They say holla at a real one in the trap
All across the map sports center
Trap jumping likeEmbed
