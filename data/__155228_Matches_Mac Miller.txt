Soul!

Ever since a nigga had recess
Mothafucka felt like a grown-up (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playin' 'round the corner
Seven years old, saw my first porno
Damn, that fucked me up
At ten, I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what?
Let's recap, the Earth spinnin' too rapid
I'm livin' too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
The security guard sparks my cigarette
The old head go 'head, cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look twenty-two
They say, "You'll learn when you get older"
I just say that that ain't true
That just mean when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got L's so I'm ridin' high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm twenty-five, no lie (Uh)
You might also like
I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes (Hoes)
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose (Chose)
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes (Goes)
Tell 'em all what they missin', while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodgin' my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best (Oh, oh)
Watchin' my step, never no college plan
Found myself noddin' off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from "The Bachelor"
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Fallin' in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fuckin' Dalai Lama (Ooh!)
Only eighteen but I had my own business
Then I got fame like, "What the fuck is this?"
Whole bunch of cameras, fake-ass bitches (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody around wanna treat me all different
Oh, I'm cool, 'cause I got money? (All this money)
Back in high school, none of these hoes was tryna fuck me (Fuck me)
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scarin' me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets
They, they, they been lookin' for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Somethin' brand new, wonder what it might be
You party off them drugs, movin' at a nice speed
If you eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older
If you eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older

I wanna rule the world, take care of my family
And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds
Blaze a gang of trees
Went to see a rated R movie 'bout me
They said you must be
Eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older36Embed
