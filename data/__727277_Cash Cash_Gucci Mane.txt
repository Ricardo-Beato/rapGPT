Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
I got a bag full of cash

Cash Cash nigga, Cash Cash
I got a big ol’ bag, I serve that gas gas
Flat bag, coke packs, trap back, snap back
I’m in a Maybach with your main bitch
Nigga don’t like that
I’m a pimp, need a white Lac and a white hat
Cash Cash, Og bags
It’s big GuWop I make your OG's mad
That's yo big homie? he on his last
He’s doing bad, no cash cash

Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
I got a bag full of cash
You might also like
I'm on the main stage with your main bitch
At my festival
My psychedelics from overseas, and my gas from Sherman Oaks
So tell me what you need, cuz we making that dough
I keep that American cheese, and Mexican pesos
I got a girl from Cambodia, oh international
She don't even have a national, bank account or car
But she be really in them streets, I mean damn she going hard
She won't ever get deported, I might give her a green card
Cuz that cash cash is all I fuckin' need
When I blow that gas gas, I don't  care who's in need

Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
Cash Cash, Cash Cash
I got a bag full of cash7Embed
