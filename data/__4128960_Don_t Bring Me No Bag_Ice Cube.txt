Hey man, get the door
These mother fuckers think it's CVS around this bitch
Tell him we ain't 'bout that shit

Yo, who is it?
Uhh, Nick
Yo, nigga, what up?
Oh, nothin'
Why you come to this motherfucker so early all the time, man?
You-you said 1 o'clock
I don't give a fuck what I said, nigga
I don't get out the bed before two-thirty
Don't come through this motherfucker so early next time, nigga
Understood
Let's see what'chu got

Ain't 'bout to count no money, ain't sellin' no dope
Don't bring me no bag, I want a envelope
Ain't 'bout to count no money, nah, ain't sellin' no dope
Don't bring me no bag, I want a envelope

Ain't no disrespect (disrespect), well maybe it is
Ain't no trappin' here (Trappin' here), well look here now, bitch
Ain't no Oxycontin (No oxycontin), no coke or no thizz
Have you forgotten (You forgotten) who the fuck that I is?
You might also like
Trap or die, that's a lie, niggas fry or testify
Superfly, get super high, jigga boo shit, supersize
Niggas do shit and justify
You can do shit and get euthanized
I could do shit, that's no surprise
Serve your ass, two piece and fries

Ain't 'bout to count no money, ain't sellin' no dope
Don't bring me no bag, I want a envelope
Ain't 'bout to count no money, nah, ain't sellin' no dope
Don't bring me no bag, I want a envelope

You niggas high as fuck (High as fuck), got slow reaction
I done sobered up (Sobered up) and I'm down for action
And I fuck you up (Fuck you up), if you come 'round askin'
Don't try to play me (Try to play me) like I'm Anglo-Saxon
You a mouse in a trap house, I'm a dog in a cat house
I'm comin' like Harriet Tubman, you comin' like Harry the drug man
Some niggas don't give a fuck, man, 'bout they own people sufferin'
Talkin' 'bout that they strugglin', made somethin' from nothin'

Ain't 'bout to count no money, ain't sellin' no dope
Don't bring me no bag, I want a envelope
Ain't 'bout to count no money, nah, ain't sellin' no dope
Don't bring me no bag, I want a envelope
I'ma kill me a dope dealer
I'ma douse me a trap house
Who let the dogs out?
I'ma make niggas crawl out
I'ma make niggas call out to Jesus and they momma (Jesus and they momma)
Right before they vomit (Before they vomit) blood out they stomach (Blood out they stomach)
This for my auntie, she smoked your shit daily
And this'll make you crumble, yeah, just like it did my uncle
And this'll make you meet your maker, understand that he's the baker
Got your ass on the slab now you the dope for the undertaker

Ain't 'bout to count no money, ain't sellin' no dope
Don't bring me no bag, I want a envelope
Ain't 'bout to count no money, nah, ain't sellin' no dope
Don't bring me no bag, I want a envelope

Don't bring me no bag
Don't bring me no bag
You-you a mouse in a trap house, I'ma dog in a cat house
You-you a mouse in a trap house, I'ma dog in a cat house
You-you a mouse in a trap house, I'ma dog in a cat house
You a mouse in a trap house, I'ma dog in a cat houseEmbed
