Yo, yo, what's up?
Yo, man, give me some of that old, gangsta-ass shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Some shit I can just kick back, smoke a fat-ass joint to
You know what I'm saying? Haha
Hell yeah, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
I like that old gangsta shit
'Cause you know it's a lot of niggas out there
Woofin' all that bullshit, talkin' 'bout they got this and got that
Talkin' louder than a motherfucker but ain't sayin' shit
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, nigga, I see your lips quivering
But you ain't sayin' a motherfucking thing
But my niggas, I got my niggas in the motherfuckin' house
And they gon' tell you what's really going on
Got my motherfuckin' nigga RBX definitely in this motherfucker
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker, ready to kick some real shit
Know what I'm saying?
And that little shit you hear in the background?
That's my homegirl Rage
So, RBX, kick this shit

Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse 'cause I'm the fuckin' murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse
Snap, adapt to this, but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
In a book from a crook
You get caught slippin', your ass gots to die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure
Trigger happy, RBX to cap you
Pump, pump, and I can't wait to bust a round
Pump, pump, my hollow point smacks the clown
'Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me running from the feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive
I'm high powered
You might also like
Yeah
It's Daz, that mass-murdering motherfucker
So, what, you feel like you wanna get caught up?
Fool, you better recognize
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side7Embed
