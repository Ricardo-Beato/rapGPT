Take a hit of that stuff
Ultraviolet dreams
That's some good shit man!
Stuff should light now
Oh that shit's good man!
Ultraviolet dreams
It's like the biggest joint man
(Oh no!)
That's the hook up!
Ultraviolet dreams
Hook up, this is!
(Pass that shit homie)
Pass it around
(That stuff right there)
Ultraviolet dreams
Ã“rale!, hey I'm holdin' it
Let me see that
Ultraviolet dreams
That's some good shit man!
God damn!
Feed me
That's some good shit
