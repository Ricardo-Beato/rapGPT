5 ContributorsI Donâ€™t Care Lyrics
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Yeah

You got weave in yo' hair, I don't care, I don't care
Yeah, you say you got a man, I don't care, I don't care
You got shots in yo' butt, I don't care, I don't care
Girl I still wanna fuck, I don't care, I don't care
Nope, I don't care, I don't care
Nope, I don't care, I don't care
You got shots in yo' butt, I don't care, I don't care
Girl I still wanna fuck, I don't care, I don't care

Look me in my eyes and ya see that I don't care
And I'm lookin' at ya edges and I see that ain't ya hair
But it really don't matter cause I had her at the Mondrian
Big titties, fake ass for the ambience
So elegant, poppin' it, sellin' it
All up on ya IG in the mirror with the cell in it
Snapshot, butt shot, think not, think so
I don't really give a fuck, I want the bank hoe
Fake it 'till ya make it, shake it now get naked
You can take what I gave you as a roll and try to bake it
In the oven with the rest of the shit
While he complainin', I'm tryna the big best of the bitch
You might also like
You got weave in yo' hair, I don't care, I don't care
Yeah, you say you got a man, I don't care, I don't care
You got shots in yo' butt, I don't care, I don't care
Girl I still wanna fuck, I don't care, I don't care
Nope, I don't care, I don't care
Nope, I don't care, I don't care
You got shots in yo' butt, I don't care, I don't care
Girl I still wanna fuck, I don't care, I don't care

Fuckin' with this girl in the south
She had a body out this world
I ain't ever think that she would be my girl
Left the city on a mission, tryna better her position
When she did, she never came back
Chase dime bitches
So I moved on and so did she
She didn't even notice me
At the concert backstage wit' Jodeci
She had a new look, a new face, a new drum beater
And from the looks, I could tell she had been under the needle
Dr. Miami, used to be slim, now she all beef patty
Damn Tammy, I see ya got it goin' on witcha weave too
You say it's all yours, yeah I believe you
You got weave in yo' hair, I don't care, I don't care
Yeah, you say you got a man, I don't care, I don't care
You got shots in yo' butt, I don't care, I don't care
Girl I still wanna fuck, I don't care, I don't care
Nope, I don't care, I don't care
Nope, I don't care, I don't care
You got shots in yo' butt, I don't care, I don't care
Girl I still wanna fuck, I don't care, I don't careEmbed
