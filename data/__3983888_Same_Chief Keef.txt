Same
Just in case motherfuckers thought I changed - I didn't
I’m still the same young nigga
Ayy, know how the fuck we bleed
Glory Boyz, Crashout gang (Ayy)

If you thought I changed, I didn't, uh
I'm still the same, lil’ nigga, yeah
Run with the same lil' niggas, yeah
We don't got the same extendeds, no
We handle the same lil' business, yeah
We chasin' the same lil' chicken, yeah
Got three of the same cars, yeah
I'm reppin' the same block, yeah
I’m actin’ the same, woah
Don't say I changed, no
These 257’s
Give you the same smoke
We not on the same shit
We don't tote the same sticks
Then break the same brick
The gang on the same shit, bang

My bitches thought my number was the same
New Gucci coat, dancin' in the rain
She say she want some, I want the same
She know I be passin' 50’s out as change
I'm with same gang till the grave
This not the same, not from yesterday
Gotta hire best lawyer if I catch a case
Go to sleep high and go to court the same
You might also like
If you thought I changed, I didn't, uh
I'm still the same, lil' nigga, yeah
Run with the same lil' niggas, yeah
We don't got the same extensions, no
We handle the same lil' business, yeah
We chasin' the same lil' chicken, yeah
Got three of the same cars, yeah
I'm reppin' the same block, yeah
I'm actin' the same, woah
Don't say I changed, no
These 257's
Give you the same smoke
We ain't on the same shit
We don't tote the same sticks
Then break the same brick
The gang on the same shit, bang

My new bitch got a butt-shot (Huh)
She was the same 'til the butt dropped
Woofers in the trap, sound like gun shot
Automatic pump, eat these buckshots
Yeah that's the same chopper, what now?
Ayy, let me cool down I got my gun hot
You lil' baby is a lullaby
Say that's my baby... I deny
If you thought I changed, I didn't, uh
I'm still the same, lil' nigga, yeah
Run with the same lil' niggas, yeah
We don't got the same extensions, no
We handle the same lil' business, yeah
We chasin' the same lil' chicken, yeah
Got three of the same cars, yeah
I'm reppin' the same block, yeah
I'm actin' the same, woah
Don't say I changed, no
These 257's
Give you the same smoke
We ain't on the same shit
We don't tote the same sticks
Then break the same brick
The gang on the same shit, bangEmbed
