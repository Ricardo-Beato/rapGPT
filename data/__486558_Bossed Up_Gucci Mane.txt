Yeah, we bossed up
Got that paper, nigga
It's KD baby

Bitch, I'm stacked up, bitch, I'm racked up
Yeah, bitch, I'm turnt up, yeah, bitch, I'm bossed up
Aye, bitch, I'm stacked up, bitch, I'm racked up
Bitch, I'm turnt up, yeah, and I'm bossed up

Boss, boss, motherfuck the cost, cost
M&Ms off lipstick
I'm not no pornstar but my waistline hold a dick
Pow pow pow pow, make him dance, cha cha cha cha
Thugger cowabunga, I got Bentleys, Hummers
Last floor condos for my baby mamas
Thousand dollar bands, 20 of 'em on me
Yellow VVS's, peel it, man, I'm looking corny
I got millis or the Fendi or the Bentley or the billis
She want Denny or the Jordans or them Forgees on a sporty
I drink lean, you drink 40s, I'm a bear, bitch, I be snoring
I cook fish, I cook fish, and the scale, I be snorting

Bitch, I'm stacked up, bitch, I'm racked up
Yeah, bitch, I'm turnt up, yeah, bitch, I'm bossed up
Aye, bitch, I'm stacked up, bitch, I'm racked up
Bitch, I'm turnt up, yeah, and I'm bossed up

Smoking on that Keyshia, fuck a mary jane
Started in this industry on my model game
Now I'm on my mogul shit, fuck the fame
Now I'm signing deals, fuck the game
Now I'm the baddest bitch, they scream my name
Got a couple millions, ain't that a shame?
Bitch, I'm that bitch, ain't nothing changed
Bitch, I'm stacked up and I'm and I'm racked up
Yeah, I'm turnt up, and I'm bossed up
Bitch, I'm stacked up and I'm racked up
Yeah, I'm turnt up, and I'm bossed up
I'm a boss bitch, I'm selling lipsticks
Buy the-buy the boatload, like it's coke though
Griselda Blanco but you don't know
It's Ka'oir, ho, aye

Bitch, I'm stacked up, bitch, I'm racked up
Yeah, bitch, I'm turnt up, yeah, bitch, I'm bossed up
Aye, bitch, I'm stacked up, bitch, I'm racked up
Bitch, I'm turnt up, yeah, and I'm bossed upEmbed
