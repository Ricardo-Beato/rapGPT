Uh
I can't listen if you can't be accountable
I'm not your competition never been your obstacle
You peacocking just to walk a dotted line down the middle
When you talk now you sound like a pillow
I see the daggers in your eyes like javelins
Ain't nothing going on but the smile on the mannequin
I fantasize about a peaceful release date
But that's standard life we all reaching to keep faith
Sometimes I gotta climb inside, start it up and drive
Just to figure out why I'm allowed to be alive
I was overestimating the damage
It ain't supposed to be as average as the picture on the package
Your fireworks got my sensories on high alert
I'm not trying to put my energy inside the worst
I fight the urge, to submit to your hurtful shit
I ain't got the wish to waste on a perfect bitch

I'm bored
You're bored
Stay together, what for
(Can't even hear you anymore)
I'm bored
You're bored
Stay together, what for
(I can't hear you)
You might also like
Another morning in my mirror with my self righteous
Remind myself that you ain't the first that felt like this
However I should've know you'd be putting in work
To make sure my songs are full of those beautiful curse words
And I don't wanna be dramatic about it
I'm the protagonist, I guess I'm automatically bothered
I took the batteries out of my back a hell a while ago
Trying to help the smile grow
That's why I'm listening to music just to try to feel human
No introduction necessary, pardon my intrusion
Honestly not interested in whatever you're doin'
Just let me get my ticket for that rocket to the moon then
I don't get bored instead I shut the doors
Until I'm feeling like the ceilings trying to touch the floors
I swear to god you're probably not being ignored
I just don't care enough to argue 'bout it anymore

I'm bored
You're bored
Stay together, what for
(Can't even hear you anymore)
I'm bored
You're bored
Stay together, what for
(I can't hear you)
I'm bored
You're bored
Stay together, what for
(Can't even hear you anymore)
I'm bored
You're bored
Stay together, what for
(I don't hear you)
I'm bored
You're bored
Stay together, what for
