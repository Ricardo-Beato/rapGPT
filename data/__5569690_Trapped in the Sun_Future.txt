That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond
I gave the plug to my nigga, I gave the game to my sons
Yeah

That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun (For when I trapped in the sun)
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond (When I couldn't make bond)
I gave the plug to my nigga, I gave the game to my sons (Gave the game to my son)
You need to learn the recipe, how to put a three on a one (Yeah, yeah)
Like the plug to the socket, I'm connected (Yeah, yeah)
I get bored, I might give away a necklace (Yeah, yeah)
That yellow Lambo' outside for when I trapped in the sun (For when I trapped in the sun)
That green Ferrari sittin' outside when I couldn't make bond

He wanna be a superstar, I bought him a magazine
For his birthday, got him a Glock, hold more than seventeen (On God)
I been on Adderall, I been on gasoline
I had some Haitians with me, they off the pork and beans
I did new registration, I did some new Celine
They line up at the wolf doctor, actin' like some fiends
I microwave the pound, I never cut the lean
I got dope in my blood, it's full of promethazine
You need some molly in your drink to boost your self-esteem (Yeah, yeah)
I'm in Amiri every day, say fuck them Levi jeans (Yeah, yeah)
He wanna be a superstar, I bought him a magazine
I can't be a role model, 'cause I'm a trappin' king

I copped the Porsche and it made me more ambitious (Yeah, yeah)
Got foreign cars in my driveway, I'm a misfit (Yeah, yeah)
