Pie (Ooh, pie)
Pie, pie (Oh-woo, pie)
Pie, pie (Yeah, ooh, pie)
Pie, pie (Pie)
Make her sorry, you should know (Ooh)
That kinda chick'll never be alone (Yeah-yeah)
Make her sorry, you should know (Ooh)
You're so, so full, you let your side go (Haha)

I turned the side piece to a nine-piece (Oh, yeah, ah!)
She out lyin', it shouldn't even matter, she mine (Oh, yeah)
I told her, "Baby, fuck it up one time" (Fuck it up)
Ba-baby, fuck it up one time
I turned the side piece to a nine-piece (Yeah, ooh)
She out lyin' (Ha), it shouldn't even matter, she mine (Yeah, ooh, oh, yeah)
I told her, "Baby, fuck it up one time" (One time)
Ba-baby, fuck it up one time (Ooh-ooh)

Baby, fuck it up
It's your birthday, go 'head, put that cake on me
Commas and zeros, I'll be your hero, ain't no cape on me (No cape)
All you niggas lame, I ain't gotta pay (Shit)
You know talk is cheap
Ain't talkin' money, ain't no conversatin' (Gang)
I've been leanin' all day, I'm faded
And she been fiendin' all day, but can't take dick (Haha, ooh)
Sippin' out a two-liter, put an eight in it
White linen on my pillow, put her face in it
Baby, fuck it up and do what you like
All these drugs in my body got me seein' double
Ménage à trois, double trouble (Oh, yeah)
(This should be fun)
You might also like
I turned the side piece to a nine-piece (Ooh)
She out lyin' (Ha), it shouldn't even matter, she mine (Yeah, ooh, oh, yeah)
I told her, "Baby, fuck it up one time" (Fuck it up)
Ba-baby, fuck it up one time (Ooh-ooh)

Gassin' up on lean and good Percs (And good)
Lapdance, gettin' pie on my t-shirt (On my t-shirt)
She know how to fuck, yeah (Yeah)
She ain't lookin' for true love here (Yeah)
Let her see a million (Mil', oh, yeah), she don't wanna go (Yikes!)
I roll a hundred deep, we like sharin' hoes (Sharin' hoes)
Caviar on your plate, girl, wipe your nose (Fuck it up)
Out of chance, find you three-six-oh

I turned the side piece to a nine-piece (Oh, yeah, ah!)
She out lyin', it shouldn't even matter, she mine (Oh, yeah)
I told her, "Baby, fuck it up one time" (Fuck it up)
Ba-baby, fuck it up one time
I turned the side piece to a nine-piece (Yeah, ooh)
She out lyin' (Ha), it shouldn't even matter, she mine (Yeah, ooh, oh, yeah)
I told her, "Baby, fuck it up one time" (One time)
Ba-baby, fuck it up one time (Ooh-ooh)
She could never be loyal (Loyal)
But she's so fine (She's so fine)
She gon' make a nigga spoil her (Spoil her)
Just to keep her on the side (On the side)
I just want to taste her water (Taste her water)
Let's stay hydrated (Hydrated)
Girl, I got a main thing at the house (Number one)
Tell me, can you stay down?

I turned the side piece to a nine-piece (Oh, yeah, ah!)
She out lyin' (Ha), it shouldn't even matter, she mine (Yeah, ooh, oh, yeah)
I told her, "Baby, fuck it up one time" (Fuck it up)
Ba-baby, fuck it up one time
I turned the side piece to a nine-piece (Yeah, ooh)
She out lyin' (Ha), it shouldn't even matter, she mine (Yeah, ooh, oh, yeah)
I told her, "Baby, fuck it up one time" (One time)
Ba-baby, fuck it up one time (Ooh-ooh)22Embed
