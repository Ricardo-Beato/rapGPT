I think I need something new, something you got for me
I'm the one to give it to, to get into, I'm ready
I'ma get comfortable
'Cause you know I won't be here all week
And we both got it in on freak
We ain't afraid of sexuality, oh

No games, no way, José
Foreplay, don't fake both ways
Like Olay, and I won't chase to it, OJ
Soul based, and I'm on face like I'm Colgate
Hallways when I go all day, get it (Uh-huh)
Now it's the one to throw it back with it
Fittin' all that, he ain't gotta call back
Trippin' this, prison this, nigga I don't get it, I'm addicted
Reading all my feelings, need a one-way ticket
Looking so fly 'cause I mind my business
Self-proposed but you know I'm vicious
Slow your roll, you can't lie to me, baby
I see it all in your eyes and your face
Want these knees to go opposite ways
And I see you fiendin', go off on it, babe
I don't need to speak, I'm not talkin', babe
You might also like
'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?

You're coming on to me
And I can read it all up on your face
Control it, get your way
Baby, you can't hide from me
Come and vibe with me
Boy, it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you out before you say goodbye to me
And boy, it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you out before you say goodbye to me

'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?

Good self control but you stickin' it out
A figure of mouth, don't wonder why you twistin' your loud
She twerkin' it out and wonder why they thirstier now
Every night dodgin' broke niggas, curvin' 'em out
Like every pipe got its own feelings lurkin' below
I mean, really? Do you love me? Is it certain, for sure?
I got money, nigga, know you gon' be hurt if I don't
But I got niggas in my city and my bitches is cold, so
Tell me what you had in mind
Watch it closely, we'll unwind
Psychology of the mind
You do your job, I'll do mine
'Cause the body doesn't lie

'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?
'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?

I think I need something new, something you got for me
I'm the one to give it to, to get into, I'm ready
I'ma get comfortable
'Cause you know I won't be here all week
And we both got it in on freak
