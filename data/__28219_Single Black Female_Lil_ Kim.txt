Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, and it don't stop
Yeah yeah, and it don't stop
Yeah, and it don't stop
B.I.G., rock-rock on
Uh huh, and it don't stop
Yeah yeah, and it don't stop
Yeah, and it don't stop
Queen Bee, rock-rock on

Sometimes a gal fi get kuff (hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Ain't that the truth, frontin' like they bulletproof
Lil' Kim this, Lil' Kim that
"She wack" but stay bangin' Lil' Kim tracks
Your career is on the rocks again
Yeah, I'm back on top, what?
You forgot Queen Bitch, W-W-W-dot-com
Read the 27th Psalm, sing along
The Lord is the light of my salvation
Thou shall fear when He calls
So when you MC's come to eat up my flesh and blood
Ya'll all will stumble and fall (ha ha!)
Still that's not all, bitches have the gall
To be bitin' my rhymes, said B.I.G. write my rhymes
My nigga gone now, so who writin' my rhymes?
No disrespect, ya'll bitches owe me publishing checks
You might also like
If I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya now
(Queen Bee, Queen Bee)
Would you keep, just keep on feelin' me
(Wha? What?)
If I tell ya, I'll tell ya how I feel
(If I tell ya how I feel)
Would you keep bringin' out the best in me?
Stop stressin' me

Keep my jewels frozen like they've been in the freezer
Haters, if that don't please ya, I don't need ya
Even Mom Dukes live in an igloo
Bought my whole crew businesses for Christmas
Yeah, I see ya'll, colorful minks and things
Polars on ya shoulders, about a half in ya rings
Whoops, got to switch my pitch up
Pin-stripped suits, Bvlgari specs
Black pearls around the neck
Come on, ya'll chicks can't be serious
How's the weather down there my dear? I'm just curious
Been the sex symbol since Jack B. Nimble
You can never be me, you can only resemble
Copped the presidential suites for weeks, ya'll just a day out
One ass picture in a magazine, I gets a layout
My nigga gone now, so who writin' my rhymes?
No disrespect, ya'll bitches owe me publishing checks
If I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya now
(Queen Bee, Queen Bee)
Would you keep, just keep on feelin' me
(Wha? What?)
If I tell ya, I'll tell ya how I feel
(If I tell ya how I feel)
Would you keep bringin' out the best in me?
Stop stressin' me

Stop wastin' all of your time
Doin' all that yappin', bitin' her writin'
Don't know that she's the Queen
Why can't you see?
Ya'll should just believe
Every time she tells you

If I talk freaky, then that's my business
If I dress freaky, then that's my business
Got quoters praticin' how to spit like this
Sexy C-E-O makin' hits like this
Huh? I know you pissed, but take some advice from me
In five years, you'll be nice as me
But right now, nah, ya'll ain't ready
I'm a single black female and this goes out to Heddy
If I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya now
(Queen Bee, Queen Bee)
Would you keep, just keep on feelin' me
(Wha? What?)
If I tell ya, I'll tell ya how I feel
(If I tell ya how I feel)
Would you keep bringin' out the best in me?
Stop stressin' me1Embed
