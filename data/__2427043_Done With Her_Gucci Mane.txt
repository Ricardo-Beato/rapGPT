4 ContributorsDone With Her Lyrics
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
Oh that's yo girl but last night I had some fun with her
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
I did some things with her you probably ain't even done with her
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
I'm beatin' her thing up from the back like I'm The Punisher
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
She seen poppin' bottles standin' on the furniture
I'm done with her

She doesn't run, her friend, he can handle us
She doin too much just like Nina, like my counselor
Then she work in Magic City then I'm dancing her
Bitch do you want these all hundreds, I'm just askin ya
These niggas ain't getting no money, get yo dollars up
I call up squad and they hold 100 bottles up
She a bad bitch, a pimp, I'm tryna auction her
She super fly, so fly that other bitch is shockin her
He so lame, he say he don't wanna bother her
Internet, gangsta tryna get some followers
You can have her back my nigga, I just borrowed her
She wanna stand next to me, get seen by photographers
She ask what's my side bitch? I don't, ascrolaja
I was a jit wearin' duck head and Nautica
Alligator was no slick as Atticus
And I'm a tax me a bitch, it's time to audit her
You might also like
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
Oh that's yo girl but last night I had some fun with her
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
I did some things with her you probably ain't even done with her
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
I'm beatin her thing up from the back like I'm The Punisher
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
She seen poppin bottles standin on the furniture
I'm done with her

We be standin on them couches, 20 bottles up
No, we take em to the crib and hit the models up
If that's yo wifey come and get er cause I'm done with her
If you see the things she be doin you'll be done with her
Then I passed er to the homies, they had fun with her
Homerun, everybody had to turn er up
She be tweakin', we be skiin' on yo furniture
Christopher Rios, back shots, I'm a punisher
My nigga Gucci told me she's a ho bitch
She drank that out the condom, what a cold bitch
Wiped it on yo sheet, caught er in the street
Icy in the V, hit er' from the back, wifey is a freak
Yellow diamonds on my Audemar, told er I'm a call er ma
Blowin' money fast like I'm slingin' dope and ball em up
40 bottles, 20 hoes, 30 cars, 100 O's
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
Oh that's yo girl but last night I had some fun with her
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
I did some things with her you probably ain't even done with her
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
I'm beatin' her thing up from the back like I'm The Punisher
I'm done with her, I'm done with her
She seen poppin' bottles standin' on the furniture
I'm done with herEmbed
