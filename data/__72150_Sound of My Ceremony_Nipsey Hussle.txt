14 ContributorsSound of My Ceremony Lyrics
Now if I break your heart, lil' momma, don't make a scene
You really mad at yourself 'cause you couldn't do it to me
Probably call me a failure if I ain't never achieved
I rather you call me cocky for livin' like I believe, that I'm a king
No sympathizin' with the fake or suprises from the snakes
It's flock season and I value my estate
So I bought some barbed wire 'case they tryna climb the gate
Houston Rocket on my waist
Hip-Hop cops on my case, but fuck 'em, more deposits in the bank
God damn a nigga straight, crooked letter on my face
I'm a fly crip but I rep my whole race
Couple of us eatin' good but everybody want a taste
They say, "Get with it or them niggas gon' take"
I say, "If you want fish, let me lead you to the lake"
But niggas lazy and I'm a late night, early mornin' nigga 25/8 Life wasn't easy growin' up, I had to make somethin' out of nothin'
If you struggled you relate
But now I'm straight, everything great
I don't need your help now, nigga, all of y'all late
That's why I made sure all of y'all shake
The way y'all ride dick I think all of y'all gay
Practice all night, ballin' all day
Sleepin' on the flights, when I land I get paid
I ain't got a boss, I am not a slave
Turnin' up my hustle is how I give myself a raise
And it's funny how people let money make 'em change
See you stickin' to the script then start rippin' out the pages of history, it ain't a mystery
If I died yesterday, my life would be a victory
These niggas sound stupid, sayin' they invented me
But arguin' with fools is a waste of energy
I'm a franchise player and a owner of the team
And they only envy me 'cause we on a winnin' spree
You might also like
Now, this the sound of my ceremony
The sweet smell of success, yes, I wear it on me
The Snoop Dogg lookin' nigga in the mirror told me
"Keep gettin' money, fuck bitches, and beware of homies"
'Cause Brutus killed Caesar, and Judas killed Jesus
But that's where I'ma leave it
'Cause they call it dry snitchin' if I take it any deeper2Embed
