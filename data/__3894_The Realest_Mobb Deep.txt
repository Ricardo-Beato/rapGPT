47 ContributorsThe Realest Lyrics
This the killa's shit, dunn
No doubt, the undisputed
For street niggas livin' with they lives on the line
For young guns comin' up durin' these times
For police who find drugs, lettin’ niggas slide
For niggas out slingin', like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitchin' when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in ya life

Yo, when the gat's revealed, you cats get peeled, and that's the deal
Fuck a bitch-ass that switch fast, niggas that lack the real
When the slugs burst, G Rap be aimin' at your mug first
Niggas is blood-thirst, we'll see who get plugged worst
We dug earth, the place we put the nickel-plate is to your facial
Bullets ain't racial, kid, they only hate you
My nine'll seem like it's a time machine — B.C. date you
Jackin' you more than Ripper
My fifth's a organ shifter
The human organism lifter
You'll be hearin' organs if ya leavin' orphans, if ya
Let these fours hit ya where the Lord split ya
I forbid ya to bump heads with those that dump lead
Accurate shots in back of your knot, leavin' one dead
G Rap, Havoc and Prodigy
Let's put these bitch niggas where bodies be, dunn
Yo, if it gotta be, it gotta be
You might also like
For street niggas livin' with they lives on the line
For young guns comin' up durin' these times
For police who find drugs, lettin’ niggas slide
For niggas out slingin', like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitchin' when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in ya life

When the gat spits, some niggas get blown off the atlas
The half is — unsolved mystery re-enactments get practiced
What you lack is — you think like the average
Jakes dumbfound and leavin' crime scenes entangled
Nothin' but cannons, gat conspicuous
Like a laminate, or branded, with the serial scratched
Bad apple outta the batch, dunn, they made me like that
If I could push back the clock, probably leave it like that
Draw blood for my niggas G.O.D, Ty Nitty and Twin
And Twin is not here, plus my kin
Killa B forever with me, quick to set it with me
Enter QB to show love throughout the years with me
You got guns? We got guns — the serious ones!
Leavin' foul powder stuck in your lungs
We come from where niggas look out for they dun-dunns
Love, never disrespect, hit niggas with re-direct
For street niggas livin' with they lives on the line
For young guns comin' up durin' these times
For police who find drugs, lettin’ niggas slide
For niggas out slingin', like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitchin' when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in ya life

Never prejudge, it be the humble that squeeze slugs
It be the ones standin' still that'll peel guns
Spill blood for my dunns thuggin' for me
Man, you don't wanna get involved fuckin' with P
I spent more nights illin', less nights chillin'
The more shots they hold, the better they feel it
What be the deal is? Some killers like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespect, and the rest
Are so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be burstin' off guns like a Vietnam vet
On the steps, sittin' in the staircase bent
Thinkin' on ways to take another man head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth
Change clips, switch clothes after I spit
Place niggas back in they space, fuck is on your mind, kid?
For street niggas livin' with they lives on the line
For young guns comin' up durin' these times
For police who find drugs, let niggas slide
For niggas out slingin', like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitchin' when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life4Embed
