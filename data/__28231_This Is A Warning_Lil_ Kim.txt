11 ContributorsThis Is A Warning Lyrics
Yo
I just don't understand
Lately, it seems like
I don't know
It just seems like
It seems like
Everybody wants

My style, my life, my blood
My shoes, my clothes, my gear
My watch, my rings, my chain
My cars, my money, my home
My body, my sweat, my tears
My power, my fame, my strength
My shit, my this, my that
Bitches, please

If you don't stop;
Someone's gonna find yo' ass dead (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna poison your food (This is a warning)
Someone's puttin tags on your toes (This is a warning)
Someone better pray for you (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get yo' keys (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna open your door (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna creep in your house (This is a warning)
And put the {*gun cocks*} straight in your, mouuuuuth
This is a woman's, threat (This is a woman's)

Have you ever heard the story, about the M.A.F.I.A. tip
See Big Poppa was shot, a long long long long time ago
And when he was killed
He left me with the throne
And now it seems like, everyone wants my blood, if you don't stop

Someone's gonna find yo' ass dead (Someone's gonna find yo' ass) (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna poison your food (Your food) (This is a warning)
Someone's puttin tags on your toes (Ohh, yes they will) (This is a warning)
Someone better pray for you (Pray, yeaaaaa) (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get yo' keys (Your keys) (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna open your door (To your house) (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna creep in your house (This is a warning)
And put the {*gun cocks*} straight in your, mouuuuuth (Don't stop, no no)
Someone's gonna find yo' ass dead (You'll be sorry) (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna poison your food (Keep doin', you'll see) (this is a warning)
Someone's puttin tags on your toes (You'll be cryin') (This is a warning)
Someone better pray for you (I know!) (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get yo' keys (What'cha doin' 'cause I'm watchin') (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna open your door (This is a warning)
Someone's gonna creep in your house (This is a warning)
And put the {*gun cocks*} straight in your, mouuuuuth
Hohhhhohhhohhhhohoohohohhhhohohhhhhhh
