I'm selling that good 'caine, got dope under my fingernail
I keep me some good white (coke), it's going on retail (clearance)
Puttin bitches on detail, just so I can eat well
We cooking up that fish scale, its going on retail (ya ya)

All this dope on me, I'm bout to explode
I got a bomb on me, now and go straight to the bowl
I had to cook it up myself and bring it all back
It hit the block every day, nigga run up them stacks
He jumped it all he jumped it all like me (like future), nuh-uhhh
Our house is a 100 degrees (straight up), where I'm from
I put that kush in my lungs, I count up chips
Water water water, bag up them zips
Work your wrist, cook that fish, 36, in a brick
Get a flock and make a fist, get a pot
Find a bitch, open shop, this ya spot, at her house, trap it out

I'm selling that good 'caine, got dope under my fingernail
I keep me some good white (coke), it's going on retail (clearance)
Puttin bitches on detail, just so I can eat well
We cooking up that fish scale, its going on retail (ya ya)

Bitch, I want the yayo, like Boston and Diego (boss)
Stacking cake like leggos, all that work is paid for
We're cashing out and lay low, pockets in the kitchen
More touchdowns than Ocho, we don't never close
24, uncold, ice like super bowl
Talk to migo, tell him bring that twerkalator
Make sure the fish A-1, Make sure this fish
You gotta have that clean when you remix
I could put a brick together like a puzzle
I'm in the middle of the street with j's' in a huddle
My clientele love me, I don't have to touch em
This money coming in, nigga I can't trust ya

I'm selling that good 'caine, got dope under my fingernail
I keep me some good white (coke), it's going on retail (clearance)
Puttin bitches on detail, just so I can eat well
We cooking up that fish scale, its going on retail (ya ya)

I burnt up two cell phones, just this week
I'm starting to work off the boost since my mix-tape got leaked
It was soft, now it's hard like concrete under your feet
I turned my grandma house to a drug store, we're serving all week
What your order is, I pay the water bills (round here), water crystal clear
Dope is out of here, I got that Earl Manigault jumping out the gym
Straight drop glass, 
Smoke up smoke up smoke up, if you a smoker
I got that crack for you in my toaster
If you get too close, sir, I'ma have to roast ya
Have the cash in your hand when you approach a roller
I'm selling that good 'caine, got dope under my fingernail
I keep me some good white (coke), it's going on retail (clearance)
Puttin bitches on detail, just so I can eat well
We cooking up that fish scale, its going on retail (ya ya)1Embed
