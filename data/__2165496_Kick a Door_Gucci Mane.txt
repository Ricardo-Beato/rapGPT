Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Me and my boys, man, we love kicking doors, nigga
Kicking doors, nigga, ram a door, nigga
Me and my squad finna work this nigga door, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody on the floor, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga

Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody on the floor, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody gotta go, nigga

Me and Mojo down to kick a door, nigga
Where it at? Better bring it to the door, nigga
Half a million dollars laying on your floor, nigga
On the low, dog, I'm cut throat, nigga
I'm a real killer, I be with street niggas
We love beef, nigga, and we'll deal wit ya
So Icey goon squad, I'll let the goons get ya
See, they don't rap, dog, they just pull triggers
I'm talking Big J, I'm talking Lontae
I'm talking Jon Boy, and Uncle Terry
We never scary, but bitch we thugging
And Mr. Floyd got star status 
You might also like
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody on the floor, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody gotta go, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody on the floor, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody gotta go, nigga

Pistol to his head, piss running down his leg
He shitted on his self and found his ass left for dead
I'm looking out for feds, 'cause snitches be hating
I rob your partner wild and then you come and get some straight
44 snub nose hit you real close
Smoke the bubble kush, blood, who gives a fuck, folk?
Rob Gucci Mane? Ha, that's a good joke
I call Anlo and Randy, they get the good smoke
I make you bring it to the door
If the money right, nigga, put your ass on the floor, nigga
I make them bring it to the door
Everybody, everybody face down on the floor, pussies

Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody on the floor, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody gotta go, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody on the floor, nigga
Kick a door, nigga, kick a door, nigga
Everybody, everybody gotta go, niggaEmbed
