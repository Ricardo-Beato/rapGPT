And here we go again
Y'all callin in reinforcements
The Mobb come through, stop up the shit
P'll come through and shot up your vest
Shoot at your head, not-a-leg eh?
Nigga I will kill your bitch
Then fuck her and make you watch
We do thangs, like raid spots
Probably catch you on the Hummer, just give you my Glock
(Here) Or most likely in the club, we gon' give you them knots
This is what gangsters dance to, or turn to a thug party
Once we step foot in the bitch, it's on again
Outside we got them boxy trucks
Hoes wanna jump, cause of that Benz emblem
The ho say she wanna ride in the shit with the horse logo
I got her out of her panties and boom boom
And I done left bitches out in the boonies
Frontin on that pussy, leave bodies wherever
Niggas tryin to kill me?

Yo, we livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit - nigga we still alive
We livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fittest nigga, and we still alive
We livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit - nigga we still alive
We livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong..

No doubt, my niggas hold me down whenever in beef
Talkin all that bullshit but it's the hammer that roast
If your shit ain't clappin off then you sure to lose
Aiyyo the streets don't give a fuck about you
For you ain't bendin the rules
Come around lookin icey then you runnin the jewels
Nigga you ain't gotta like me, homey get your food ate
The whole plate, rip a fella ear to ear I'm talkin his whole face
And scream my name, cause it hold weight
You cowards are jealous
Glass slipper wearin niggas we call 'em Cinderellas
Gonna be a slug shower and there ain't a umbrella
That can help you protect that ass from gettin wet
I can see it in your eyes, your bitch ass is pet
Home team I'mma promise and you cowards ain't a threat
Introduce a fella to death, in the form of chrome
Nigga, now you in the danger zone

Yo, we livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit - nigga we still alive
We livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fittest nigga, and we still alive
We livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit - nigga we still alive
We livin this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong..
Aiyyo thug life we still livin it1Embed
