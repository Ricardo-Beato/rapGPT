Mama came home with a band

Mama came home with a band
Mama came home with a band, had to hit 'em with the fast
Put the homies on with a band
Put the homies on with a band, now the car go hella fast
Mama came home with a band
Mama came home with a band, had to hit 'em with the fast
Put the homies on with a band
Put the homies on with a band, now the car go hella fast
Mama came home with a band
Mama came home with a band, had to hit 'em with the fast
Put the homies on with a band
Put the homies on with a band, now the car go hella fast
Mama came home with a band
Mama came home with a band, had to hit 'еm with the fast
Put the homies on with a band
Put thе homies on with a band (yeah), now the car go hella fast

Mama came home with a band
Lot of  love me, I'm the man
I be feeling like I can
When the shit hit the fan
Who gon' be the one to reason?
Bitch, I'll be reinvest
Sometimes I need a place to vent
Call all my sins and repent
I need to prevent
All these walls want me to spin
Don't want to live it like i did
La, la, la, la

Mama came home with a band, had to hit 'em with the fast
Put the homies on with a band
Put the homies on with a band, now the car go hella fast
Mama came home with a band
Mama came home with a band, had to hit 'em with the fast
Put the homies on with a band
Put the homies on with a band, now the car go hella fast
Mama came home with a band
Mama came home with a band, had to hit 'em with the fast
Put the homies on with a band
Put the homies on with a band, now the car go hella fast
Mama came home with a band
Mama came home with a band, had to hit 'em with the fast
Put the homies on with a band
Put the homies on with a band, now the car go hella fastEmbed
