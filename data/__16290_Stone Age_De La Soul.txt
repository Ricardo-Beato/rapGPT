Beatbox
I'll beatbox
I'll beatbox
I'll beatbox
I'll beatbox
I'll beatbox
I'll beatbox
I'll beatbox

A-mic test, one two
Aww man, I check it better
Whatcha mean Biz Markie? Whatcha mean Biz Mark?
I hit the rhyme with the mayonnaise, that's what I mean
Whatcha mean Biz Markie? Whatcha mean Biz Mark?
Man, I got beats up my sleeve like you wouldn't believe
Whatcha mean Biz Markie? Whatcha mean Biz Mark?
With my (A-one two) I substitute about a loop
So let me serve ya with the slow, with the Plug of two scoops

Mr. Miyag' never did dip for Dove
Bootleggers my legs and, grit about a hug
And who gets the Motts, I knots by the chance
I rain-dance, I rain-dance
But stepping just a bit I don't need another shadow
Makes makes, is gonna be the new man's motto
Don't increase the bull, because my pulley is broken
And my belly is full
It's a second I reckon on the bone and the ball
Makin' London bridges fall, so check it
I bring a point to the joints that we change and chop
But we could bring it back to the beatbox
You might also like
I'm Posdnous Plug Wonder, plotter
Serenade her 'cause I got a, record
When in the womb I was naked, now I
Chill with latex 'cause of how I, enter
The black wood without a splinter, proving
I had the chills what helps in moving, asses
Saw the light cause I got glasses, so we
Sip the cappucino slowly
(I'sah makes big money)
(I drive big) Cars,
Serve the bubble like a bar, tender
When in flight like a sender, lace
Sticks of dynamite on bass, head
Lace the shoe until he dead
Run, 'cause the cop is gonna come
Diss my Plug style
So they can kiss my, grits
Hold my balls without a mitt, grab
The mouthpiece to talk the dag, nabbit
I keeps goin like that rabbit, rico-
-chet a dame I need a Snicker, satis-
-fy the Norman to the Gladys, Knight
My glasses help me see the light, so we
Sip the cappuccino slowly
(In life, it's what you see is usually whatcha) Get
Won't take a Drag-without-a-Net, known
To put the rhythm in the bone
Marrow, laid the pipe to please Cari-lou
(I don't know)
If it's true
That's a fumble
Well, catch a fever from the jungle
Chocolate, nubian girls flock to it, sweets
And if I can't sample beats, get the
Beatbox equipped with the, dirt
Biz Mark and Doug E. works, fine
Mase work the wheel I tangle lines, HARK
The light is thirsty in the dark, so we—
Beatbox
I'll beatbox
I'll beatbox
I'll beatbox

It's like I saw it in the river but my M wasn't fixed
Super heavy like a Chevy pump a Maseo mix
I had some screams in my pockets, and played it kinda hush
And did the outs (Got to check out the avenue)
I peeped the Zoah on the gimme-gimme, plus we hit the plat'
Then the amps was on samps, the villains got fat
The Natives went to neighbor then to (Nigga please)
It's a hustle for a joint when your settlement G's
But we still be on the wax because it acts like that
We still be on the moves because it moves like that
So there ain't no reason to don't stop
'Cause we can bring it back to the beatbox

Yo who—, I don't know who was on this mic, man
This thing smells awful here, manEmbed
