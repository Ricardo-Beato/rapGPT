You keep calling me like I really wanna be messin' with, like— (Sorry if my words messed up your head)
I done told you I was sorry, I don't always mean it, but I said it just to shut you up 'cause you trippin'
Damn (You think that you're better off dead), Lil Uzi Vert, yeah

And I'm sorry for everything I ever said, yeah
I'm sorry if you were misled, yeah
And I'm sorry if my words messed with your head, yeah
You think that you're better off dead, yeah (Woah)
She caught me acting all sad, damn
Everything bad, damn
That's why you can't fuck with fans, damn
This not in the plan, damn
I am so high I can't land now
So I'm basically sent by the man now
I'ma just do what I can now
From my existence, this girl is banned now

Told that girl I won't be in no jam now
Ain't no way you can, um, have my baby (Have my baby)
Told that girl that she acting too crazy (What?)
She want me 'cause I'm driving Mercedes (Skrrt)
Well, it's Maybach, so this is too different (Vyoom)
She like the way that my rims be sitting (Yeah)
She like the way my bass, it be hitting (Let's go)
She looked at me, her lips she keep licking
I had to ice out my Rollie (Woah)
I drive my whip like it's stolen (Like it's stolen)
She thought I was gon' say "Get in"
But everything in life is written (Woah)
My Balmain jeans barely fitting
She do anything just to fit in
Oh my gosh, she start to lickin'
I like to play with her kitten
My boys just came home
It is no reason to risk him
I'm the one that get the stick in (Bow)
Say my diamonds too big can't get wrist in (Yeah)
You don't hear me, better listen
Stand on my money, I'm tall as Pippen (Yeah)
I'm sorry I'm tryna pitch in (What?)
I'm so sorry that I'm tryna fix him (What?)

You is too bad for my brain, you is too bad for my memory (Bad for my memory)
But I love when you give brain, I swear that's my only memory (My only memory)
Everything that you say I did, but I swear not a sin in me (It's not a sin in me)
Every time that you went out, you always linked up with a frenemy (Wait, what?)
Girl, I saw you with the opps, you is not family, no kin to me (Damn)
I swear that shit, it need to stop, I am too numb, it ain't killing me (No)
Matter of fact, you can do what you want (You want)
Okay, shut up, are you done? (Be quiet)
I'm not falling for that, I'm not dumb (No)
You the one, I'm not the one that's sprung (Yeah)
You the one, I'm not the one that's up (Yeah)
Drowning all my sorrows up in rum (Rum)
I'ma count this money with my thumb (Thumb)
I can make that girl cry 'til she cum (Cum)
I remember she said I was nothing, yeah
Now she's bussing, yeah (Yeah)
My life faulty, yeah
I'm unlucky, yeah
And I'm sorry for everything I ever said, yeah
I'm sorry if you were misled, yeah
And I'm sorry if my words messed with your head, yeah
You think that you're better off dead, yeah (Woah)
