32 ContributorsMouth Full of Golds Lyrics
(Drumma Boy)
It's Gucci 2 Time
Gucci, Gucci (Gucci)

Please pardon me, but I'm passin' gas
To my entourage, no gas masks (Gas)
I'm in my old school with the Georgia tag
With my Georgia ass and my red flag
I'm G'd up from the feet up
In my black van with my feet up
And the blinds down and the beat up
Short bad bitch with the seat up
You know me, from the old me
On Jump Street with the straight D
I was low-key at HB
Now I'm 3D, come face me
I went toe to toe with the best of 'em
I bust shots at the rest of 'em
Don't test me, no tester
I rape you, like Chester
I'm a rich-ass nigga, you a bitch-ass nigga
You a cornball ball, so snitch-ass nigga
Went up to the game, felt sick to the fame
Run up on me, in a ditch quick, nigga
I'ma tell you twice 'cause I'm Gucci 2 Time
Fuck your clique and fuck your wife
If you got drama, nigga, you can meet me outside
Get your head bust wide for your old man pride, it's Gucci

I put red shoes on my black car
I'm talkin' slick like a rapstar (Huh)
I'm walkin' slick like a trapstar
Rich young G with gold teeth
A true black cat just crossed my path, but it's a four door Jaguar (Huh)
They put me in this game, but put you lames back at the snack bar (Burr)
I'm black as hell (Burr), but I'm rich as well (Burr)
Got three dime pieces at the hotel (Burr, burr)
I'm goin' hard, they blowin' hard
I'm strapped up, no bodyguards (Stupid, it's Gucci)
I'll pull your card, tote disregard
I'm goin' dumb, but I'm thinkin' smart (Ha)
But if you try my squad, I'll hide your body parts
Then send a shout out to Boulevard (Yeah)
Then send a shout out to Bankhead
Gotta give her something, looped her camel in (Burr)
'Cause I pull up in that yellow thing
Fat pockets like I just been gamblin' (Yeah)
Put 100K in my grills, shawty
That’s the way that I feel, shawty (Oh)
Ice cream on my face and chain (Oh)
'Cause that’s the life that I live, shawty (Gucci)
