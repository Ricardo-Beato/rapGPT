23 ContributorsScarface (Iâ€™m Up) Lyrics
Tell the D.A., give a fuck bout what the judge say
I never liked that pussy nigga in the first place
I spent 500 K a week just for the court case
And put a tattoo on my face, so now I'm Scarface
Scarface
I put a hundred on your head if you cross me
Scarface
I want him dead, I don't care what it cost me

The Black Cats, Red Dogs, jumping out on me
Unmarked cars keep on riding up and down the street
Plus the stupid-ass junkie, he want something for free
Know damn well, without no money he get nothing from me
I be that ass, baby momma call the folks on me
I got these crab-ass niggas trying to smoke for free
Lil G just told me that he's short this week
But how the fuck he gonna be short when I sell work so cheap?
Old pussy-ass nigga used to work for me
Then told these motherfucking folks he bought some work for me
I know some cold-blooded killers who got love for me
I keep them real-deal goons in the club with me
Gucci

Tell the D.A., give a fuck bout what the judge say
I never liked that pussy nigga in the first place
I spent 500 K a week just for the court case
And put a tattoo on my face, so now I'm Scarface
Scarface
I put a hundred on your head if you cross me
Scarface
I want him dead, I don't care what it cost me
You might also like
Niggas waiting on me like the mailman coming
First, third, and fifteenth, everybody running
Old heads tripping cause they asking me to front on them
Come short on my one time, and I fuck with them young'uns
All balls, no brains; niggas know I'm ignorant
Understand and get zeroed when put in that predicament
The cars ride up and down the avenue in daytime
Nighttime the same thing -- niggas finna pay mine
Duck off with my motherfucking dope, you got some long nuts
I burn niggas' hoods down, I shoot up they dope cuts
Niggas call me Scarface cause I gave them a reason to
All you get is one chance and then I come get even, fool

Tell the D.A., give a fuck bout what the judge say
I never liked that pussy nigga in the first place
I spent 500 K a week just for the court case
And put a tattoo on my face, so now I'm Scarface
Scarface
I put a hundred on your head if you cross me
Scarface
I want him dead, I don't care what it cost me

Moving them grams, and I ain't thinking bout Grammys
Got so hot in Atlanta, I had to move to Miami
Going honey baked H.A.M., got my trap house whamming
Just ran up on the plug, I brought the food to the family
We say hello to drugs, we don't say no to drugs
Like No Limit C-Murder, making moves with the dubs
Like I'm moving them birds, I got em for sale
Just like Revenge of the Nerds, I got a roomful of squares
The Feds looking at me -- get some glasses, my nigga
They say I make it hot -- I make it happen, my nigga
So what's cracking, what's popping?
Got the same gun that killed Bin Laden
I like my boxer briefs soft cotton
I'm used to being spoiled rotten
It's Gucci
Tell the D.A., give a fuck bout what the judge say
I never liked that pussy nigga in the first place
I spent 500 K a week just for the court case
And put a tattoo on my face, so now I'm Scarface
Scarface
I put a hundred on your head if you cross me
Scarface
I want him dead, I don't care what it cost me1Embed
