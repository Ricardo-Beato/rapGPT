7 ContributorsOutro (Delusions of Grandeur) Lyrics
Ayy, let me get somethin' straight here
Honorable C.N.O.T.E.
So you niggas had a lil' run in the game and think you doin' somethin'?
How 'bout you niggas run the game every time you drop?
Wait, hold up, hold up, hold up
So you niggas think the culture like you, you done figured this shit out?
Where you niggas gon' change the culture?
Yeah, we see you got a couple followers
But don't you dare come close to that goat emoji
That's exclusively for Wop (Wop)

Money on money on money on money on money on money
I get money in my sleep, I get money on Sunday
Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, I'm makin' some money
Friday and Saturday, I'm booked, Sunday, I'm out the country
Armani, Armani, Armani, Armani, I'm rockin' Armani
My closet exclusive, I pick out a 'fit just like shoppin' at Barneys
Started from nothing, got fronted, and only got thirty off a hundred
I said that I did it, admit that you run up on Wop, you get punished

Trap God but I'm not God, hey
She gon' suck it when it's hard, hey
New Wraith in the garage, hey
I can turn coke into hard yay
I'm so rich, I gotta pay, hey
Ain't no more room in my safe, nay
San Felipe boy, call me Clean Ray
Fishtailing out in a Stingray
Got a fiend buying dope at a mean pace
Said the truck stop, yeah, at the D&J
Got two white girls, they Kim K
Rockstar wasted like Green Day
Stick in a rental, brick in a Sprinter
Mama gon' tell you might pray for me, nigga
Pray for you, nigga, play with me, nigga
Ain't gon' play, I'ma just pay for you niggas
You might also like
Money on money on money on money on money on money
I get money in my sleep, I get money on Sunday
Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, I'm makin' some money
Friday and Saturday, I'm booked, Sunday, I'm out the country
Armani, Armani, Armani, Armani, I'm rockin' Armani
My closet exclusive, I pick out a 'fit just like shoppin' at Barneys
Started from nothing, got fronted, and only got thirty off a hundred
I said that I did it, admit that you run up on Wop, you get punished

Life on the line, nickel and dime
Thought I was jokin', I caught me a nine
Old niggas hate and they sit on the pine
I stayed in the A and I got me a line
Stick make you hiccup, I shot with your re-up
Want some ketchup, if you run up get wet up
I get you hit up and go kick my feet up
VVS bricks, we might drop on a Brinks truck
Money on my mind
Still in the pot, whip a nine
Wheelchair, nigga, break his spine
Glacier Gang, still in my prime
I'ma put the dick all in her spine, woah
I'ma just do it for the Vine
Flatline a nigga 'cause he lyin'
Wop hit my line, then I'm ridin'
Longway, bitch
Money on money on money on money on money on money
I get money in my sleep, I get money on Sunday
Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, I'm makin' some money
Friday and Saturday, I'm booked, Sunday, I'm out the country
Armani, Armani, Armani, Armani, I'm rockin' Armani
My closet exclusive, I pick out a 'fit just like shoppin' at Barneys
Started from nothing, got fronted, and only got thirty off a hundred
I said that I did it, admit that you run up on Wop, you get punished

Delusions of Grandeur
Gangsta Grillz
Yeah, we came so far
I'm richer than all my opps
Throw up, pussy
I know you see me1Embed
