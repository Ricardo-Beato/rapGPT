9 ContributorsQUEEN OF THE DAMNED LyricsThese Niggas ain't Bona fide
Niggas ain't ready, ain't born to slide
These niggas ain't born to ride
Niggas ain't ready don't want it chile
I'll send you the Dolja guy to
Hit you in your poker pout
Cause you's a joker child
Niggas be makinÂ´ em' LOL a lot!
Tired of being thrown aside
It's a suicide, you're in a suicide
I feel the soul inside s-s-soulless child
Overdrive, I'm overdrive
Okay nigga sure you right
It's a suicide, you're in a suicide
Tired of being thrown aside
Get goin' child
(Beware of Yung Rapunxel)
It's a suicide, you're in a suicide
Cause you's a joker child
These niggas ain't bonafide
You ain't born to ride
Niggas think
OK LITTLE NIGGA THINK YOU BAD BECAUSE YOU WANNA RIDE!
WHEN I GET MY HANDS UP ON SOME CASH, NIGGA, YOU GONNA DIE! (You Gonna die....)
I GOT SOME HANDGRENADES, SOME EXPLOSIVES, TIME TO DIE!

Hit the pole like jujitsu, they ain't official
Not even a little, God Damn!
