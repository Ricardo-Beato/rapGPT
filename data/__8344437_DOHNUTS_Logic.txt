4 ContributorsDOHNUTS Lyrics
The first thing you're going to learn about is how to hook up your MPC
Put your headphones on, get ready to go
Prepare yourself for a stereo show
The whole world's mad for the modernized sound
Of the stereo disc and the tape with the earphones
Bass on the left side, singing on the right side
I can hear the bass playing much too softly
Turn up the volume
Turn it!
Turn it!
(Kick it over here)
(Kick it over here)
Turn it down!
Turn it down!
Turn it down!
Turn it down
