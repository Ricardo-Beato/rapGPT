129 ContributorsBack Down Lyrics
Woo
Yeah
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (G-Unit)
Haha

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go, both coasts with toast
East side, west side, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see a OG
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must decease existin', little nigga, now listen (Yeah)
Your mammy, your pappy, that bitch you chasin'
Your little dirty-ass kids, I'll fucking erase 'em
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard (Yeah)
Knowing that if you get knocked, you get fucked in the yard (Ah)
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle (Haha)
I eat you for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful 'cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from your hood, you have no history (Uh-huh)
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot, haha (Haha), pussy
You might also like
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go, both coasts with toast
East side, west side, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see a OG
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

"The rap game is all fucked up now, what are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around"
That's Ja little punk ass thinking out loud
South side 'til I die, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the Cookie Monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas, they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You're never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah or Crack Child
Them niggas there just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back, better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys saying, "50 we feeling you, mane"
Now y'all stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy (Bad guy)
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go, both coasts with toast
East side, west side, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see a OG
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

I ain't gon' tell nobody you pussy
I ain't gon' tell nobody you getting extorted (Nah, it ain't over, G-Unit)
I've been patiently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "The 50 Cent Show"
This is my life, my pain, my knife, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?
You hired cops to hold you down 'cause you fear for your life
But you done heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfuckin' soldier, nigga (They not gon' like you)
I know, I know, haha (G-Unit)

Oh no, he didn't say anything about Ja, okay?
Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla
Now everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture
They better not put they hands on Jeffrey, okay?
'Cause first of all, they do not know that I am a twelve degree pink belt, okay?
I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery, okay?
'Cause, see, they don't know me, Delicious
Do they know me? Okay, I thought so
'Cause you know I know karate, and I will see him
And I will Jet Li his ass, wa-ta!40Embed
