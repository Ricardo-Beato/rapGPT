Everything hand made
Everything hand made
Everything hand made
Everything hand made, from the bags to the case, everything's hand made
In Paris, goin' Kanye
This Fendi came up today
You know boy we spending cake

Handmade Louis, handmade Gucci
Handmade hell, yeah we'll start shooting
Fuck that bitch one time, and we start cooling
My whole bih handmade, so we start grooving
Hand made guns, hand made mags
Man made cash, hand made bags
Hand made seats, hand made stash
Hand made gears, hand made dash

Everything hand made
Everything hand made
Everything hand made
Everything hand made, from the bags to the case, everything's hand made
In Paris, goin' Kanye
This Fendi came up today
You know boy we spending cake
You might also like
Its Siberia, getting hand made gas
You ain't smokin, boy you weak, hand made trash
Pull up with some shooters and some hand made mags
I just sip a sip outta handmade glass
I just put my feet in some handmade boots
And I live under a handmade roof
And I only smoke on handmade joints
I'm just really tryna make a handmade point (sosa baby)


Everything hand made
Everything hand made
Everything hand made
Everything hand made, from the bags to the case, everything's hand made
In Paris, goin' Kanye
This Fendi came up today
You know boy we spending cakeEmbed
