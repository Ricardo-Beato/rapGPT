7 ContributorsDumb Fine Lyrics
True shit, new shit, took the bitch to room quick
Forgiatos, big lips, I'm squattin like a blue pic
Fed investigation say a nigga sold 2 bricks
Police allegations say I whooped em with a pool stick
Rims wearin make-up, yea I had to get the lipstick
Broke bitch grew up in the hood eatin fish sticks
Rich nigga bitch suck a dick, I'm for rich trick
Talk shit, game slick, bitch couldn't even resist me
The thick bitch, bitch you gots yours skinny as a toothpick
6th grade my teacher said I'll be just a statistic
Snitch dissin ass niggas, won't you be specific?
Blowin sticky icky like the hippies in the 60's

A bad bitch, shit this bitch, Shorty too fine
But she a broke bitch and I don't fuck with those kind
Shorty super thick bitch, Shorty dumb fine
Straight drop the deuce but I'm gon water whip it next time
You think you cute but bitch you standin in the weak line
You screamin Guwop is yo man but you out yo damn mind
Pussy roll that's GP, yellow diamonds that's PP
Stupid kush and it's musty
I can't see me but you hear me

The diamond the back, my top drop back
And yo girl lookin so hot that she don't know how to wreck
Bitch you know how Gucci kick it, you can't pay me with a check
24/7 im handling business, bitch you know that I'm a vet
Every time I make a move gotta talk to my connect
And if that nigga wanna come get wet, then let his ass get wet
I pour a 4 up, you pour a deuce, spot
I like my hoes, they come in 2's
I like my cars, and I like it new
You's like yo hoes, you like em used (brand new)
30000 for er in the 2
You push to enter, 2 bitch all on you
You might also like
A bad bitch, shit this bitch, Shorty too fine
But she a broke bitch and I don't fuck with those kind
Shorty super thick bitch, Shorty dumb fine
Straight drop the deuce but I'm gon water whip it next time
You think you cute but bitch you standin in the weak line
You screamin Guwap is yo man but you out yo damn mind
Pussy roll that's GP, yellow diamonds that's PP
Stupid kush and it's musty
I can't see me but you hear meEmbed
