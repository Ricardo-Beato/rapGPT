61 ContributorsTrillionaire Lyrics
I was so high out my mind, I thought I wasn't gon' see tomorrow
Yeah
Stayin' ten toes down with my head up (Woah)
Teezy on the beat (Teezy on the beat)
Mafia the dream, we just gon' chase it
I was talkin' to, um, I was talkin' to Slime when I said, um
I think I asked him do he think, do he think I could do seven
Then he said "Bro, you fuckin', is you fuckin' crazy?" That nigga said, "Hell yeah"
Then he said some other shit behind that

Reportin' straight out of the slums (Slums)
From rags to riches, I got me some bitches and I changed up how I come (Come)
In a drought when your pockets got mumps (Mumps)
These niggas believin' in nothin'
Ran up my sack, you know I ain't dumb
Wherever I'm goin', I pull up with somethin' (Doot-doot-doot)
38, Atlanta, Lil Haiti (Haiti)
Where I'm from, it's hard to make it (Make it)
I'll never let 'em take it (Take it)
Grammys, I was nominated (Woah)
Told that bitch that I'm leavin', so face it (Face it)
Get a new ho and have me a baby (Baby)
Out the jungle, I conquered and made it (I made it)
It still don't feel like I'm famous (Famous)
You might also like
Feel like they don't feel me now, yeah (They don't feel me now)
Fill it up, stuntin', they see me now, yeah (Yeah, I'm stuntin', they see me now)
I'm steps away, I can't stop now (I can't)
No, I won't let you waste my time (Yeah)

Surrounded by some millionaires (Oh-woah)
And I know I'ma be one when I walk off
Feel like I can be a trillionaire (Oh-woah)
Yeah I'ma be the one that they talk 'bout
Yeah

I'ma be the one they talk about
I'ma be the one they envy, yeah
Hate it when you made it out the struggle
Love to see a nigga in the trenches (Pluto)
Went to sleep, had a few nightmares, nigga just left off a mission
I'm the one paid my dues, dropped out of school, now I'm winnin'
I had a girl with some red hair, made a nigga feel like Chapo (Freebandz)
Just got off the phone with vato, know a young nigga gon' kill somethin'
I wanna get me a mil' ticket, my young nigga wanna get his murders up
Gotta go get me a million, spend half of it on convertibles
Jumpin' off the porch, no daddy, had to go and get mine out the gutter
Came up poor and ashy, now a nigga take care of my mother (Swear)
Wish I had a cure on sickle cell, hate to see my sister suffer (Got you)
You can never put a price on how much I love her
Surrounded by some millionaires (Oh-woah)
And I know I'ma be one when I walk off
Feel like I can be a trillionaire (Oh-woah)
Yeah I'ma be the one that they talk 'bout

Feel like they don't feel me now (Like they don't feel me now)
Flexed up, stuntin', they see me now, yeah (Yeah, I'm stuntin', they see me now)
I'm steps away, I can't stop now (I can't)
No, I won't let you waste my time (Yeah)

Represent out the gutter, yeah, yeah
Fell in love with my Cartier, yeah
Go to war 'bout my brother, yeah, yeah
I'll kill 'bout my brother, yeah, yeah
Used to sleep on the floor, yeah, yeah
Used to kick in the door, yeah, yeah
I finesse with the bros, yeah, yeah7Embed
