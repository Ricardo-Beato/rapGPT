4 ContributorsGirlz 2 (DMX All Vocals) Lyrics
Yeah, uh
 (verse 1)
Girls are my profession and obsession, I place nothing above them
To me they're not possessions I really truly love them
Short ones, tall ones, big ones, small ones
Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall ones
Yo, I love them all, especially the cuties
The ones with the smooth complexion and shapely booties
With the type of bodies that'll make you say "Oh Boy" ya
But baby if you're ugly, I ain't got nothing for ya
I'm not conceited, I'm convinced that I've been naturally blessed
To be desired when naked and irresistible when dressed
And with that, brings that, breaks down resistance
Of me to a cutie, I bag them for instance
I seen a cutie with a bootie, wiggling just like Jell-O
Me being a player, I approached and said "Hello"
But she didn't hear me, so I tapped her softly
She turned around screaming on me "Back up off me"
I said damn, there is no need for hostility
I'm a mellow type of fellow but still with tranquility
She said "I recognize that all of y'all are the same
After only one thing, and I'm not simp for the game"
I said "Come on now sweetheart, do I look like a Player"
She said "Of course not...sike"
But for the sake of argument let me know the deal
I want to ask you
You might also like(DMX singing)
Are you for real?
Are you really for real
Is this love I feel
The way you make me feel
 (Verse 2)
I'm as real as it gets
My name is not James Brown, but I could leave you in a "Cold Sweat"
And I bet, no ifs, ands or maybes
When I finish I'm a have you saying "Do Me Baby"
She said "Alright, I'ma give you a try"
Because she said "I think you're kind of fly and my type of guy"
She said her name is Crystal and kept a pistol on her
And she said if I ever cheated, believe I'd be a goner
So I played the perfect gentleman every time I was with her
And when I wasn't with her I was gone to get her
And when I wasn't going to get her, she was come to get me
And when she wasn't coming to get me, she was with me
So for awhile, everything was smooth
I waited and contemplated my next move
My instincts told me that the time was right
For us to get together for a magical night
So I called her, I said "Hello" she said "Hey, hold on
I already know what you have to say"
(DMX singing as if he was Crystal)
Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
Because I'm not too sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
For I don't know how I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I
 (Verse 3)
Hold on sweetheart, just chill, relax
You're telling me the answer and I didn't even ask
Don't you think, that we should be alone?
This isn't the type of thing to talk about over the phone
(DMX singing)
Why don't you come over and go with me
Come on over to my place
Where we can talk about it face to face, why don't ya
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
So we can discuss the terms of picking up the pace
She said "I thought about it, and I think that you're right
But my parents are home so it won't be tonight
But umm why don't you come over tomorrow at 8
My parents leave at 7:30 and won't be back until late"
I said bet, let me go and get set
Tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget
So the next day around 7:54
I fixed up like 6 times and then headed for the door
And when I stepped outside, I was asked where I was going
By detectives with .9 millimeters that was showing
I said "To me girls house", they said "No you aren't"
I said "Why not" they said "Because you a have warrant"
I said "That's impossible, how could that be?"
That said "It's right here, robbery, first degree"
Well, anyway, to make a long story short
I ended up in Valhalla going to court
So I called Crystal that night around 8
I said it's just a mix up and blamed it on fate
She told me that she loved me, I promise to wait
She said I'll see you at 4, at your next court date
Despite being locked up, things weren't bad
I still had my girl and for that I was glad
She always came to visit, didn't mind the hike
And every night I wrote her letters telling her things like
(DMX singing)
I can't fool myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say "I love you"
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop

 (Verse 4)
Days turn into weeks, weeks into months
Today's the 25th and I've only got mail..once
What has happened to my love life?
Oh do I feel like I've been stabbed into the back with a knife
I tried to believe, I said "She loves me, she does"
But deep down, I knew what the scoop really was
See Jody has my girl, and now she was gone
Just thinking about it had me singing every love song
I'm saying to myself, how could she do me wrong?
I said it's not her fault, I was away for too long
I thought I had a girlfriend, but now I know better
She told me that she wrote me but I never got the letter
And every time I tried to call her, nobody was home
And since I had to call collect she put a block on the phone
She told me she would visit, but damn I haven't seen her
You wanna know why, because Jody is in between her
Legs and getting busy, he even ate the coochie
Yo, I bought her everything from Fendi to Gucci
But Jody had something better, he didn't even have to sweat her
And if he doesn't have her by now, he's gonna get her
(DMX singing)
Caught in the middle I don't know what to do
What can you do when your girl is untrue
There's another man (another man)
In my life (in my life)
Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)
 (Verse 5)
Beating my time, another man...was lovin mine
I was upset, but there was other things on my mind
I would start trial soon, I was facing a lot of time
And on the day of trial, I was never for awhile
But when they said "Not guilty"
I stepped with a smile
Back to freedom, freedom on the streets again
But I had to go and see what was up with my friend
So I called her, just to make sure she was home
I said "Hello" and a man's voice answered the phone
I was confused, at first I didn't know what to do
He said "It's Jody, and what is it to you?"
So I hung up the receiver, picked up my gun and
Straight for Crystal's crib, I started running
Murder, murder, my finger's on the trigger
Murder, murder, I'm a murder this nigga
But then I thought, why should I do him
He wouldn't have the pussy if she didn't give it to him
I thought about killing him, I thought about it twice and
Nah, because it wouldn't be nice
But for the sake of curiosity I had to go and see Crystal
And I asked, why did it have to be me
I knocked on the door and just like before and
I heard another man's voice play me and couldn't take it anymore
The door opened up and Jody walked my vexed
He looked me up and down and said "I guess you're X"
Now here comes Crystal, yelling and fussing
Hollering and screaming, shouting and cussing
She looked at me inside and got quite in the hall
She said "When did you get home, and why didn't you call"
I turned around to leave, she said "Please don't go"
I said "You used to be my girl but you ain't nothing but a Ho
I understand because I'm a man, but there's no way I could stay"
(DMX singing)
Spread my wings
And fly away...(away)
Spread my wings
And fly away...(away)
 (talking at the end)
Yeah, DMX the Great
For '91, pushing up no daisies
Because I'm real!1Embed
