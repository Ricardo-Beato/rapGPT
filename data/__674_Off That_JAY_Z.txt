Welcome
To the future, uhh (Blueprint, 3, ay-ay, oh, hey-hey)
Hey, count me in (Blue-print, 3, ay, hey, hey-hey)
Find me a nice soft place to land (I got you Hov', ay ay-ay)
I'm so high (Yeah, hey hey, hey, hey, c'mon)
Find me a place to land
(Fricky-fricky uhh, ahhhhh, c'mon now, c'mon now)
Yeah, right there, yeah (Fricky-fricky Hov')

I'm so tomorrow the Audemar says yesterday
Which means you on time delay
So even if I slow it dowwwwwn
My sound is fast forward, hold up
I'm just a runway show
But I wear that so my plane, these my runway clothes
Hehe, Cashmere sweats
They come out next year but these my last year sweats
And my ho's so sick
Your new chick can't fuck with my old bitch
And you know this shit
I'm professional, they novices
I just may let you borrow this
This the Blueprint, nigga follow this
This what what tomorrow is
Welcome to tomorrow BIIIIIIIIIII

Uhh, yeah we come so far
So I drive around town, hard top and it's off
Uhh, in my TriBeCa loft
With my high brow art, and my high yellow broad
Uhh, and my dark-skinned sis
And my best white mate, say what's up to Chris

Got a black president, got green presidents
"Blueprint's" in my white iPod
Black diamonds in my Jesus piece, my God

I don't give a fidduck abiddout the widdate
You used to move, what you used to do
And I don't give a fidduck abiddout the bitches
That you used to screw, what your future do
And we don't really care what you used to say
Unless that affects your future pay
I'm on a practice field runnin' Two-A-Days
So I don't drop the ball when it's threw my way
So I don't give a fidduck abiddout the shit
That you probably did, who you probably is
The only time I deal in past tense
'Cause I'm past rims, and I'm past tints
If you drivin' it, I drove it
You got it, 'cause I sold it
You copped it, I bought it back
And we don't give a fidduck, nigga we off that
Whatever you about to discover we off that (Hey)
You about to tell her you love her we off that (Hey, hey)
Always wanna fight in the club and we off that (Hey, hey)
But you can't bring the future back, back (Hey, hey)
Y'all are steady chasin the fame and we off that (Hey, hey)
Oversized clothes and chains we off that (Hey, hey)
Niggas still making it rain and we off that (Hey, hey)
'Cause you can't bring the future back, back (Hey)
Tell them haters get off me, the Cris' we off that (Hey, hey)
Timbs we off that, rims we off that (Hey, hey)
