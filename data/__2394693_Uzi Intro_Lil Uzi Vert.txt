14 ContributorsUzi Intro Lyrics
These bitches can't leave me alone
I swear I had to get me a new number, I copped me like 2 or 3 phones
And when I drop Dumber, I swear it's my summer
I'm rockin' Off White or Vlone
I jump in the Hummer, skirt off with your mama
That bitch was all in my home
She suckin' the clique, fuck every for commas
Don't let me get into my zone
And if you do that, I swear you in trouble
I feel like I am alone, cause you not my brother then I cannot trust you
These bitches be choosin' the most
You don't got no money then I don't even want you
My bands got up overnight, I'm fuckin' bitches, get money, I'm that muthafucka

We winnin', we winnin', we winnin', whoever doubt that, well we winnin'
4K on my Chanel pretendin', you kissin her lip, well my dick what she kissin'
Said hunnids, no limit, no limit, got Master P money, bitch don't got a limit
Said hunnids, no limit, no limit, got Master P money, bitch don't got a limit
I need that table and 37, AK with that MAC-11
Fuckboy bad then count his blessin', kill 'em all and leave you on a stretcher
Pencil this shit and learn your lesson, my gun hold like 47 plus 3, so you know my big gun we will knock down Mt. EverestYou might also like25Embed
