15 ContributorsNormal Lyrics
(Gangsta)
(Listen to this track, bitch)
Okay, what's happening?
Brick Squad in the building
(Gangsta Grillz, you bastards)
The weirdos
Ha, burr
(Gangsta Grizzills)

Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal (Swag too normal, shawty)
Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal (Put you up on some more shit)
Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal (Gucci)
Drumma Boy track, Drumma, this another comma (It's Gangsta Grillz)

Hit the mall, spend thirty like the shit normal
Me and my broad nothing but Gucci, Louis, Ferragamo (Gucci)
Drop racks, get it back, call the shit karma (Karma)
Fucking models when I want, all your hoes normal
Blowing kush, what you smokin' smelling really normal (What?)
Ask me if I wanna hit it, I don't really wanna (No, no)
Pulled up old school, paint Willy Wonka
Guts all white, but the rims abnormal (Damn)
Backseat of my Rolls in my silk pajamas (Gucci)
Hoppin' out in house shoes like the shit normal (Hoppin' out in house shoes)
Change my jewelry every day, cars every summer (Burr, burr, burr)
If your bitch want my number, then it's really normal (Burr, burr, it's Gucci)

Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal
Ice game dumb-dumb, now it's even dumber
You normal, I'm so cold, I need a thermal
Drumma Boy track, Drumma, this another comma
It's my summer, she thick, her ass is far from normal
It's no wonder her boyfriend keep a stupid lumber
My summer, she thick, her ass is far from normal
No wonder her boyfriend keep that stupid lumber (Gangsta Grizzills)

Pull up in a Honda, that's normal
I pull up in a Zonda same color lasagna (Yoom, ah)
My goons'll put you under, confront us
Got guns like Super Contra, stay armored (Yeah)
You bought your girl some (Ah, ah), don't want 'em (What? Hell nah)
My girl got on piranhas, that's abnormal (Mwah)
My bracelet cost a Honda, that's abnormal (Burr, burr, burr)
We'll rob you where I come from, that's a promise
She's a snake charmer, anaconda (Wow)
Real man eater like Jeffrey Dahmer (Well, damn)
I can't stand people mad 'cause their lives are normal
I got long money, bitch, put it on my mama

Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal
Ice game dumb-dumb, now it's even dumber
You normal, I'm so cold, I need a thermal

It's my summer, she thick, her ass is far from normal
It's no wonder her boyfriend keep a stupid lumber
My summer, she thick, her ass is far from normal

Bad bitches be stuntin' me
They all wanna fuck, they wantin' me (Yeah)
So I told her to kiss her homegirl, she said, "I don't do that normally" (Mwah)
Shit, I don't do shit the normal way
Gotta fuck with me the enormous way
Back in the day, humongous yay (Skrrt)
I don't do that front shit normally
Me and Flocka rockin' iced out ornaments
Make a hit, then start performin' it (Burr)
Got the club funked out like Parliament
Brick Squad, we ain't with all the normal shit
She a dime piece, but you a normal bitch
Real worrisome-ass girl, can't work the stick
Won't touch the girl nor hit the girl
She's just a normal-ass chick in a normal world
It's Gucci, baby, you a Gucci girl
Get a one way ticket to Gucci world (It's Gucci)
Where at night time, it even gets warmer, baby
Don't fuck with him, he too normal, baby (Yeah)
This Gucci, baby, you a Gucci lady
Pull my dick out, make you say, "Gucci crazy" (Gucci)
Night time, it even gets warmer, baby
Don't fuck with him, he too normal, baby (Yeah)

Abnormal, nothing that I do is normal
Ice game dumb-dumb, now it's even dumber
You normal, I'm so cold, I need a thermal
