Respect the OG's
We thank you; for giving the young niggas the crown

They say that he a young nigga
He ain't got no paper (huh?)
He ain't never made it ten years later they were caters
At my motherfuckin' cook house
I never work the warehouse
I shit on the people that said I wouldn't make it I pull up on them roll the window down skrrt
Yeah look at me now
Damn your car don' broke down
I bet you won't rid of me now
Look at how life turned around
Heard that you had the pounds
You fell off and can't push em now
You looking like a rookie now
Cause a young nigga got the crown

Young niggas got the crown
Young niggas got the crown
OG's they respect us
Young niggas got the crown
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)

Sprayin' the Champagne on the sofa fuckin' up the couch with Louboutin loafers
25 hundred nigga I put in the sole
Young nigga we got the crown and my necklace is golden
Hocus pocus you niggas know that I be exposured
And I be thanking god everyday cause a nigga chosen
So many gold chains on my neck it turned gold
I be whipping and driving the Lamborghini like it's stolen
Salute to the OG's who gave us the crown (salute)
Shoutout to the migo said nigga bitin' the style (migo)
When I'm on stage nigga drippin' like it rain
Sprayin' champagne all over the damn crowd
Ain't part of the squad then don't come around
Ain't a Young rich nigga you not welcome around
You see your favourite rapper bitin' the style
That's cause the Migos we got the crown
