1 ContributorThe GongXi Style Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Get 'em GongXi

Měi tiáo dàjiē xiǎo xiàng
Měigè rénde zuǐ lǐ
Jiànmiàn dìyī jù huà
Jiùshì gōngxǐ gōngxǐ

Gōngxǐ gōngxǐ gōngxǐ nǐ ya
Gōngxǐ gōngxǐ gōngxǐ nǐ

C-H-I-N-O-F yeah!
A-D-I-D-A-S yeah!
GongXi got me all messed up
Got me feeling aggresuv'
Man gotta love it, shout out to Dr. Ho
With that P.H.D. spit an ill Dr. Flow
Cool and simple like Adopt-a-road
But dark and deep like real rock n roll
Gimme that teriyaki with more bombs than Nagasaki
If you want to fight, I'll turn it into kamikaze
Eating these noodles upon a chop stick
Switch up the flow and then it got sick
You don't need to be AP to do this math
But Dr. Ho will enlighten our path
You might also like
Gōngxǐ gōngxǐ gōngxǐ nǐ ya
Gōngxǐ gōngxǐ gōngxǐ nǐ

Hand-writing so bad would of thought I had autism
Making love in this club formulating our prism
Doing all this mass would of thought I had volume
And if I had a gun, I'd be killing all you
Y=MX+B got the slope
I say derivative and man that's dope
Taking it to the limit see that's continous
Don't believe me and that's disingenuous
I don't know if I can keep going
Showing off my calc notebook and it's blowing
All your minds I'm just student
Got some equations and I'm trying to prove it
How do you take an integral again?
Passing that FRQ and that's a 10 out of 10, AP

Gōngxǐ gōngxǐ gōngxǐ nǐ ya
Gōngxǐ gōngxǐ gōngxǐ nǐ

Inmigrante boy, killing country club boys
If I see a pointy a hoodie, I whip out my toys
I run over these crackers in a Rolls Royce
I got Uncle Sam trying to sit on my groin
Colonization reparations are long overdue
We'll take that Andrew Jackson, wipe our asses with the fool
I'll start riots and protests with the brown kids at school
We gonna get shot anyway, might as well break all the rules
They call us aliens because they know we out of this world
But if you say that to my face, I'll knock out all your pearls
I'm on my Che Guevara, rock your world for 20 hours
You know I'm pollo loco, you bitches empanadas, que nada
I got some loose screws, but I ain't stupid
If you try to double cross me, I'll have your lungs polluted
Gōngxǐ gōngxǐ gōngxǐ nǐ ya
Gōngxǐ gōngxǐ gōngxǐ nǐ

Měi tiáo dàjiē xiǎo xiàng
Měigè rénde zuǐ lǐ
Jiànmiàn dìyī jù huà
Jiùshì gōngxǐ gōngxǐEmbed
