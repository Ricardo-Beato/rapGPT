*Alarm clock sounds*
Um, uh
Woo, yeah
Woo, yeah
Okay, okay, yeah, um

We in-between heaven and hell (Hell)
Fuck a nine-to-five, I'd rather end up dead or in jail (Jail)
American Ninja to these obstacles, no stoppin' me, we on the move
Your mouth runnin' like a prostitute's, keep your head to yourself
I work harder than anybody you know (Know)
I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow
Deadly aim, self-contained, superstar, they yell the name
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain
The P fitted on my head though, I'm too high
You can't reach me with the cell phone, no goodbyes, no hellos
You don't want this life I live, you'd rather had a wife and kid
Shootin' dice with Jesus Christ, put twenty on the midnight
To everyone who sell me drugs:
Don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hopin' not to join the 27 Club
Just want the coke-dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world, there's no one else but us (Woah)

Everything we think we love
It ain't nothin' but a brand name
To everyone but us (Every motherfucker but us)
It ain't nothin' but a brand name, nothin' but a brand name
Yeah
Ask her what she wearin', say it's nothin' but a brand name
Baby, this right here is handmade
You might also like
Yeah
I got brothers, I don't need no friends (Friends)
My shoes off, I'm comfortable, I'm chillin', smokin' weed again ('Gain)
I'm from the 'Burgh, not the burbs
Investigatin' my nation, homie, we ain't concerned
Went from the 412 out to the 310
Went from the pavement in my basement to them yellow brick roads
See, I was on my P's and Q's like L-M-N-O
But kickin' bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em go home, oh no
I was in the crib with my different shit, simple livin', I'm a hypocrite
'Cause I'm filthy rich and got businesses, been had wifey, had mistresses
Been tryin' tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listenin'
The war ain't winnin', it's just beginnin', and I been 'bout Sparta like Michigan
I got stats, they got opinions, I got facts
LeBron left home, but he came back, this what raised me, made me rap
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately, see, I left and they call me shady
I'm a white rapper, they always call me Shady, got no idea what I'm contemplatin', I guess

(Woo) Everything we think we love
It ain't nothin' but a brand name
To everyone but us (Every motherfucker but us)
It ain't nothin' but a brand name, nothin' but a brand name
Yeah
Ask her what she wearin', say it's nothin' but a brand name
Baby, this right here is handmade
Woo
La, la, la, la (La, la, la, la)
Yeah
(La, la, la, la)
Everything we love, love
Good mornin' (La, la, la, la)
Good mornin'
And everyone but us (Every motherfucker but us)
Good mornin' (La, la, la, la)
Good mornin', yeah20Embed
