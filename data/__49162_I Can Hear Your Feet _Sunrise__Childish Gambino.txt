24 ContributorsI Can Hear Your Feet (Sunrise) LyricsI do not talk
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Childish Gambino, hot as a flaming Cheeto
I'm tighter than baby speedos
I'm shifting another kilo
And that's because my shits dope
Walking past the red rope
The bouncer is my kin folk
So I don't need credentials
Sick boy is my clique
I got that shit inside a headlock
Love to make that bam bam
We were born to make the bed rock
I am so hip hop
More so than you guys
I am legend
You guys are true lies
Tipsy like some Jenga
Shout out to my topangas
Them thicky thick girls stay wrapped around my finga
Nerdy girls from every where
They scope me out like there he is
My whole crew's sick
I'm hanging out with Jerry's Kids
You might also likeHold up mother fucker
It's gambini on the microphone
Screaming like your father when he comes home and the light are on
Girls addicted to my dick
My wallet is their methadone
Brain dead niggas love beef
They are vegetables
I am on that fly shit
Fuck that, I'm orbiting
My face is everywhere
Fuck that, I'm Norbiting
I can feel your heat, momma
I can hear your feet, momma2Embed
