5 ContributorsSon of Abyss Lyrics
Imagine if we all shared a secret
Maybe then we could connect in that space where we keep it
If you and I bleed and it's the same blood
Would I still need a reason to believe in your love?
I'm trying to stay ahead of all the developments
Got to acknowledge the devil in a room full of elephants
And now I'm lookin' for an easy escape
Like, open the window, I'm 'bout to leap to my faith
For real, I feel depleted
An ocean full of weeds, emotional fatigue
And maybe if I had a bag of money
I could be the crash test dummy, quietly standin' for somethin'
I would love to get as fly as them
But I fell overboard, now I'm trying to swim
I'm still learnin' but the water is burnin'
And the world keeps turnin' like it's not concerned, and

I can't believe I used to love you
You don't believe I used to love you
But who you gonna run to?
What happened to the people that you once knew
I'm like, hold up
You lookin' at me like I'm supposed to know what to do
But when I see you come around
All I think about now is how I don't fuck with you
You might also like
And even if I had a way to say to you how much I miss your kiss
And even on a perfect day, I behave like I'm nervous of the risk
And even when I'm confident the consequence'll cost another wish
And even when it's obvious we're probably just lost in the abyss

I'm trying to breath my way through it
Sink into the waves, let 'em move me, stay fluid
So many voices and inflections
Multiple choices and different directions
And even if I had the opportunity
I don't qualify to speak on behalf of the community
And I don't even know who that would be anymore
I lost track of the tracks, I stopped keepin' the score
Or maybe I've been puttin' up my own walls
I don't return your phone calls
Got me floatin' and bobbin' on top this pond
Full of problems we bought from these dishonest spokesmen
I kinda hope we turn it all into ash
I don't wanna have to adapt to the aftermath
The tolerance is as powerful as the pain
You'd probably never know my name if you've never heard me complain

I can't believe I used to love you
You don't believe I used to love you
But who you gonna run to?
What happened to the people that you once knew
I'm like, hold up
You lookin' at me like I'm supposed to know what to do
But when I see you come around
All I think about now is how I don't fuck with you
And even if I had a way to say to you how much I miss your kiss
And even on a perfect day, I behave like I'm nervous of the risk
And even when I'm confident the consequence'll cost another wish
And even when it's obvious we're probably just lost in the abyssEmbed
