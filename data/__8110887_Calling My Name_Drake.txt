Mmm, what do I want?
Why is it so hard giving you up?
I'm countin' the days 'til you come
I'm countin' the ways to make you
Mmm, what do I want?
Why is it so hard giving you up?
I'm countin' the days 'til you come
I'm countin' the ways to make you

You're my water, my refresher
Take off your clothes, relieve pressure
I need your touch when I'm with her
My heart, it beats different rhythm

Killa cut, blood
Killa cut, blood
Killa cut, blood
Killa cut, blood

So come on, baby, let's stop playing games
Your pussy is calling my name
So come on, baby, let's stop playing games, games1Embed
