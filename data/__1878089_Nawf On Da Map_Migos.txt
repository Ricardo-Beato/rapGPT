9 ContributorsNawf On Da Map Lyrics
MIGO!
Where you from?
Where you from?
Where you from?

We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map

I put the straps in the hood
Nigga run up on a nigga in the squad
Get your ass clapped
I put the dope in the hood
Hurry up and come shop
You can come get it now
I don't mean to boast
I don't mean to brag
I put the north side on my back
That's a fact
I told you a thousand times free Offset
When he got home we was taking off not looking back
Remember the days when me and Westside
We got the mustang, them young niggas riding
Kickin' the door
Grippin' the iron
Went through the pain
We had to grind it
Blood, shed and tears on the north
I did all my dirt on the north
No niggas real on the north
R.I.P Pistol P died on the north
I work like a chemist
Then ran out the ticket
Then brought that shit back to the north
You fuck with my city, you know that's the north
I call a sniper, pick you off in the south
You might also like
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map

Offset!
We put the nawf on the map
When it's a drought niggas run in your house
Niggas talk crazy, pull up we en route
If you cuffin' then we fuckin' yo spouse
Gang activities, got locked in the chain
Somebody telling on the whole gang
Ain't no excuse when that black and white came
We was bumping Waka "Hard In the Paint"
When on a manoeuvre when I started shooting
Tried to bring up my name but the  was stupid
Doing them fours and we seen our first groupies
Pistol P dead and I swear it's a bruising
17 got a baby on the way
Went to school in a stolen mustang for 30 days
Hit for the gold then we got it appraised
I wanna be payed
So I did what I craved
(Kick door)
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf on the map
We put the nawf
We put the nawf on the map2Embed
