9 ContributorsBossin Up Lyrics
From a boy to the man
To a quarter from a gram
From a dollar to a grand
Now we blow the shit on pants
I can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Bossing up, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Bossing up, bossing up

I don’t trust no nigga, I don’t trust no bitch
All I do is get money, rock ice, and talk shit
Shoes cost 12 but I’m sitting in the 6
Can’t take no L home, I’m tryna get rich
Hit the bar for a drink but I left with a chick
Hit Cali for a trip but I left with a flip
Hit the jewelry store then I left with a kit
Then I walked in the spot looking like a whole brick
Payroll bitch, Payroll bitch
White Benz out front, that’s the mayo whip
The built up blocks and some Lego shit
She’ll get murdered now fore I say so bitch
Rich nigga, rich nigga, quick flipper, spit dealer
Iced up in the VIP nigga, big fish to you shrimp niggas
You might also like
From a boy to the man
To a quarter from a gram
From a dollar to a grand
Now we blow the shit on pants
I can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Bossing up, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Bossing up, bossing up

I don’t fuck with no suckers, I don’t fuck with no lames
Niggas turn state and they ain’t got no shame
Gave your man up for some short lived fame
But you’re a broke ass nigga wearing fake ass chains
Black tee nigga, wearing 
New shit real, Dre and Mac turned feds
Admit it bro, just imagine what he said
Had the DEA sitting round, imagining the bread
Rolls gold  nigga, not one stone
Short Glock 40 with the clip that’s long
When you talk to me nigga better watch your tone
Drunk all the PJs, bout to crack that dome
Glock 40 with drum, that’s GI Joe
Boss might pull up in that UFO
Wrist game strong, that  shit
Two tone out front, that’s Snowman bitch
From a boy to the man
To a quarter from a gram
From a dollar to a grand
Now we blow the shit on pants
I can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Bossing up, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Can’t stop, won’t stop, bossing up
Bossing up, bossing up1Embed
