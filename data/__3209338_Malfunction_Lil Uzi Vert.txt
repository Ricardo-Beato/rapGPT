71 ContributorsMalfunction Lyrics
No one wants to die alone (No)
They don't wanna miss the show (No, no)
It’s funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go (Go)
Seems to be over
Now it seems to be over (Damn)
Yeah, it seems to be over (Out of time)
Now it seems to be over

They know she's mine 'cause I rule her (Yeah)
She says he does fine but I’m cooler (I'm so cool)
I got way more diamonds than your jeweler (Bling blaow)
All my girls dress like they work at Hooters (Yeah)
First I get my racks and then I backpack (Lil Uzi)
No, I don't subtract, I might just add that (Sheesh)
Did it on my own, no, you can't tax that (Slime)
This that under the table, you can't track that (Pay no mind)

Put money your head and I move with the bread
But I do not need a toaster
Diamond, water, I'm the boatster (Yeah)
Pull up right there in the roadster
She ain't want me, I was so hurt (What?)
I was broke just like Joe Dirt (Huh?)
Where you from, throw it up, nigga
I'm from the lowest part of Earth (Yeah)
You might also like
No one wants to die alone (No)
They don’t wanna miss the show (No, no)
It’s funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go (Go)
Seems to be over
Now it seems to be over (Damn)
Yeah, it seems to be over (Out of time)
Now it seems to be over

Over you, yeah (Yeah)
I got two so you know that I can't lose, yeah (I can’t lose)
Move with my savages, you know my boys gon' shoot, yeah (They gon' shoot)
Came to the club on my solo tryna groove, yeah (Yeah)
Just keep on walking, it is nothing just to prove, yeah (Prove)
Who, him? His diamonds fake, and he can't fool us (I see it)
You know it’s Christian Dior all up on my shoes, yeah (Yeah)
White stripes on the arm of my Thom Browne suit (Woah)
You know I pull up and I got my tool tucked (Bah)
You know that I don't go nowhere without my ruler (.30)
You know everything that I said was for the mula (Yeah)
I swear that me and your love's dead, called the movers (Bye-bye)

No one wants to die alone (No)
They don't wanna miss the show (No, no)
It's funny time missed us both
We all got time when we will go (Go)
Seems to be over
Now it seems to be over (Damn)
Yeah, it seems to be over (Out of time)
Now it seems to be over
Put money your head and I move with the bread
But I do not need a toaster
Diamond, water, I'm the boatster
Pull up right there in the roadster
She ain't want me, I was so hurt
I was broke just like Joe Dirt
Where you from, throw it up, nigga
I'm from the lowest part of Earth

I told that girl I pull up her skirt
I am so hot that I don't wear no shirt
Talk about me, you fuck around, get murked
Reject your bitch with my dick when she jerk
I hit it first, Lil Uzi Vert
Know I stay on alert
Know I stay on alert
Know I stay on alert21Embed
