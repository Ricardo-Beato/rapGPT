6 ContributorsChickens No Flour Lyrics(Chorus)
This remind me of the time I thought lost my rocks
Took my j's off and they was in my socks
Stones that big I put them in my watch
Got something for you haters and its in that Glock
(We cooking chickens no flour, We count the money weigh the powder) (x2)

I got my mind made I wanna be a millionaire
I got my mind made I take them bitches anywhere
I got pocket full of stones like I'm Bun B
I got a pocket full of phones like I'm Pimp C
What ya know snow or ghetto more like Willie D
I park that lamb in that ghetto well thats silly of me (haha)
I got my backs packed yeah I'm thinking road trip
That Mr. Ice Cream, rocky road trip
I'm about that Getti Green yeah I'm bumpin Project Pat
I make it back with these blocks I bring the projects back
So I can cop that black benz for them chicken heads
I'm in the club spendin' ends yeah that chicken bread
(Chorus)

I'm in my 87' Swiss thats my stove swag
I whip it till its upset I make the stove mad
There's so much smoke up in this bitch man I can't see
And from a distance it look like I'm makin' iced tea (man you say ice t)
Everybody loves coco, when my dog was on I got them for the low low
I'm in that black on black Lamb, I call it country black
I threw them thirty's on them Lade's, now that's my country Lac
Now what ya license plate say? I'm standin' to tall, now what that .40 cal say?
Bitch I will do ya'll, is it true you be rollin' with them chopper toys?
And everytime you in the club you with them chopper boys?
