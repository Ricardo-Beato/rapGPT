(Ya know? Southside)
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight, we take it slowly (Yeah)
I'm gonna let you know the move
I'm gonna let you know the move
I'm gonna take you on a cruise
I'm gonna take you home and screw
(Southside)

And that's all I've been sayin' (Southside)
If you fall for the games, then you're the one playin'
Because it's too much money out here
And there's too many honeys out here
Feel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird
Feel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird

Rest in peace to Screw, tonight, we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love
Drop top with the windows up

Jump inside, oh, won't you roll with us?
Make the devil bite the angel dust
Shawty got a thing for us, shawty, what you want?
Tell me what you like, tell me what you want
You might also like
Rest In Peace to Screw, tonight, we take it slowly, yeah (Ooh-ooh)
I just took a four to the head like man (Ooh-ooh)
Drop the top on the slab like man (Ooh-ooh)
Off the top of the dome like man (Ooh-ooh)
Nothin' beatin' home like man (Ooh-ooh)
In the Screw tape zone like man (Ooh-ooh)
I go Pimp C on the phone like man (Ooh-ooh)
Flip say platinum, don't do chrome like man
Had the Southside fade, now let the braids hang
This shit S.U.C. smooth like man
Rest In Peace, Screw, like man

Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love
Drop top with the windows up

Screw found international sound because
Throughout the South, and it's new to, um
Shawty got a thing for us44Embed
