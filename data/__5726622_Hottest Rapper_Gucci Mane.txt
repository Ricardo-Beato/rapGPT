2 ContributorsHottest Rapper Lyrics
200 K for  cause I'm the chief executive
My cocaine counter predgedous, my whole clique 
Fuck it I'm , Gucci Mane  motherfucking mexican
Gucci sippin lean all day like a Texican
Flyer than a pelicon, 
 smuthering,  huvvering
40 K a show man, 
So icy don P,  bubbling
Hoes off Patrone all night, we thuggin
 till I put the  in
 new flash, Gucci Mane crushing

I don't dance, but my diamonds keep dancing
My pinky ring 
Who's the hottest rapper right now? Just ask him
Last year it was dude, but Gucci just passed him
Crash Coope, fast Porshe, 


I'm like the mayor nigga
I'm so player nigga
Got hoes like my name was Waka Flava nigga
Cherry red blazer, that's the trap car
Crystal clear diamonds, like a plazma
Flex mode, 23 for a 
I still rolling this , ike Tony Hawk
If you acting brave, nigga hit him with the tomahok
 DOA, white chalk
Shawty  but he coked up
I can't respect that, he a lab rat
Where the thugs at?
Where the plugs at?
Where the  at?

I don't dance, but my diamonds keep dancing
My pinky ring 
Who's the hottest rapper right now? Just ask him
Last year it was dude, but Gucci just passed him
Crash Coope, fast Porshe, 


My diamonds all ,

Just cause I'm in polo, don't think that I'm a nerd
Kush  I love pussy cause 
Don't speak about shit that I don't know, dawg
Stop pillo talking fuck nigga, it's a no no

I don't dance, but my diamonds keep dancing
My pinky ring 
Who's the hottest rapper right now? Just ask him
Last year it was dude, but Gucci just passed him
Crash Coope, fast Porshe,
