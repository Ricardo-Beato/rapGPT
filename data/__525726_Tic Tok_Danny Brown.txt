12 ContributorsTic Tok Lyrics
It go Tick Tock, all around the clock
Danny Brown on the mic, he don't stop
He go on, and on and on
He go on, and on and on

Say hello to the baby of the Reagan generation
Raised round on block cheese and boxed raisin
Use four buckets of water to take a bath
Embarrassed 'bout hunger, lying saying I pass
Yesterday's clothes, yellow teeth when I cheese
Nothing on the weed but let me hit them trees
And do you got another square? See my pockets is bare
You look in my face all you see is despair
And a newport will take the load off for a minute
Fuck the radio, don't watch TV it's all gimmicks
Mom got welfare, still hard, got a job
Turn around and lock her up for welfare fraud
Sister had a third abortion, got six kids
What's crazy, she only twenty-six
My brother lost his daughter, she was only four months
So what the fuck I'm 'posed to do but sit and smoke blunts

Danny Brown, hot nigga, raise the window
Selling rocks since the days of Nintendo
Lock them ? reaking like endo
Cheese sandwiches sipping on cool shots
Using my timberland for a pillow
Neck throbbing, feel like I slept on an armadillo
Taste like steak, it was only a pack of skittles
But that was then, now I'm back on the block
Fitted cock like Curtis in a comet
White powder, motherfucker it ain't common
So strong, make the hardest fiend vomit
Danny Brown is the future, I promise
Used to wear shoe strings for belts
Same damn Guess jeans, worn out checks
Sleeping on couch beds, crooks in my necks
Now I'm at the venue doing sixty minute sets
