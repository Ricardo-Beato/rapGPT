14 ContributorsTSK Lyrics
All I see is blurbs, all I see is words
Nerds talkin' 'bout what they did, see or heard
And all I see is clones, see you motherfuckers
With mixtape plans, because they seein' how we movin'
And all they say is this, but they ain't sayin' shit
They talk reckless when I do not work for them
They say "Come harder, come smarter", which one it is?
Which one you wanna hear? Since you such a music wiz
First thing I learned when I was comin' up in age
When they stumble in your space, is to punch 'em in the face
The second thing I learned, I was in thе second grade
Slidin' onto second basе, I can orchestrate this game
The third I heard was, if it quacks, it's a duck
The fourth, of course, just be upfront what you want
The fifth was this, keep somethin' crisp on your wrist
Now we on album six, the top team on your list

Probably grab another hun' though
Industry cutthroat, watch how I construct though, uh
Concrete jungle
If rappers were presidents, I would get Trump's vote, uh
Truly, I'm just stayin' humble
But I can take it back to Nasty if I want to
Some young dumb crazy motherfucker from the hood
You might also like
Yo, what time is it Hit?
It's your time, bro
Yeah, you know what?
Yeah, that and this and that
You know, yeah, yeah

Don't be scared to execute the vision, lock in
Get back to the art, not the trends, tsk
I mainly invented raps by bangin' on table tops
And takin' on any competition
Listen, they put hammers to your ribs, but I'm too legit to quit
They like Bishop with the blick, they exposin' who a bitch
And I'm like Furious when he took his son to fish
Droppin' knowledge on the kids, droptop when we slid
Step on lawns, trip on, Dior slide, grip on the handrails
Crib on some acres
Pull off the tails off shrimps, some beyond blond
Sip on some fine wine, we just some shakers
So when Planet Rock came out the Bronx, I was watchin' boomboxes
T La Rock never made it rich?
And when I witnessed that the benefits of livin' good from makin' hits
I make bread off what I invent

Probably grab another hun' though
Industry cutthroat, watch how I construct though, uh
Concrete jungle
If rappers were presidents, I would get Trump's vote, uh
Truly, I'm just stayin' humble
But I can take it back to Nasty if I want to
Some young dumb crazy motherfucker from the hoodEmbed
