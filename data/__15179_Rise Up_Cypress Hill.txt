11 ContributorsRise Up Lyrics
Since  the Watts riot of 1965 has the city seemed so out of control. Los Angeles is still on the edge

Living in the big city, the American dream
Is far roaming in the streets of greed
Everywhere I turn I'm on a mission for more
But I ain't selling my soul
With the dope there's no girl
I'm on a one way box to the top
Hitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block
I'm in the fast lane and I won't stop
You ain't nothing but talk
You couldn't hang on the rope by ball

This life that I live, it ain't for the weak
I'm a roddy ass gangster that came off the street
I'm trying to keep the peace, but I gotta keep my peace
Got these drunk police want me all rappy
And I'm searching for the higher ground
I want my head in the sky
So high that I can't come down
Leave your lies in every town across the nation
'Cause you can never stop to play
You might also like
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
'Cause what goes up must come down
So we gotta rise up to the higher ground
Rise up (Rise up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
How high can you get?

Cruising in the drop Chevy
Got my foot on the floor
I'm hitting switches and my brain is heavy
You wanna look inside and see who's crossing the brine
Curiosity is killing you with stick in the prime
I get high from the brim in the set
Never gripping the script
But all you haters couldn't hold my dick
Don't need a clip for my nine is straight
You should leave it alone
And check your toe 'cause my line will spit
This right here's as high as it gets
Somebody likes the split the hell
Cause you stepped on the sex
But guess who will show you, you gotta pass the check
Got my clock on deck and my custom vest streets
You came, for me I'm the best
And you can keep the dress
'Cause I'm smoke at the less
Turn a step back I'm tired of getting pushed

Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
'Cause what goes up must come down
So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)
How high can you get?

I go psycho, crazy Michael Myers
I set the stage on fire, go higher
'Cause when my name's on the flyer
There's so much more to make the whole city rise
This defines a man to get the whole world lifted
One man trying to make a land with a mission
There's no way you can stand in this position
You can't take the heat, get the fuck up out the kitchen
Born with the will to hustle, see we hittin' the floor
You'll never stop it, you ain't got the muscle
We're on the world tour, homeboy, this is for sure
We got a tour, blow the stage up, we out the door
Sometimes we all need an escape, so when we fall off track
You get your mind while we make a stack
I made a pack with a crew on the hill
We continue to build with all the people who believe their bill

We gotta rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
'Cause what goes up must come down
So we gotta rise up to the higher ground
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)
Rise up (rise up)
How high can you get?Embed
