Turn it up, Thugger
Thugger, and let's go

Halftime (What?), half a Perky, half a xanny, nigga, halftime
Half a pint, pour up an eight, my nigga, halftime
Tryna rob, that stick turn his body to halftime (Boom), yeah
Hit the streets and tear this bitch up like I'm Willie B (Yeah)
No Tennessee, but the chain on my neck is a T (Ayy)
No Memph' Bleek, bitch, I own the Roc, not JAY-Z (Rock), ya dig?
War Ready like Tracy T, ya dig? (Pew-pew, pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew-pew)
Racks on racks on racks, just might pull up on my Spider (Skrr...)
All my diamonds black, you can motherfuckin' knight 'em (...rr...)
All these pussy niggas wack, I'm a murk 'em every night'll (...rr...)
Pull up screamin' "Blatt," got my motor out a Viper (...rrt)
Got 100 million flat like my motherfuckin' idol
I might eat it, I might lick it, but I swear I'll never bite 'em (No)
Every time I dress myself, it go motherfuckin' viral (Ah)
Pussy niggas stealin' swag, bring my shit back like recycles (Ha)
I might ask her for some head
I don't know that ho, I act like she dead
Insurance on my money like a wreck (Ayy)
Every time I see her, she lick the cleavage
Fuck her on a ten-thousand dollar bed
I could never love her, fuck her head
Suck my dick like Beavis, no Butthead (Woo)
Cocaine white like Justin Bieber, bitch
I might show the racks and tease the bitch (What?)
I might want it but I don't need the bitch (Shee)
I been flooded out by Jesus, bitch (Shee)
I want your pizza, Little Caesar's, bitch (Shee)
Ninth Ward, I buy my diesel, bitch (Shee)
I don't wanna talk or see a snitch (No)
No teacher, we chalkin' shit
I passed school, I'm passin' all the staffs
I just want that neck like a giraffe
I like fish and water, I'm a bear
17.5, I shave it like it's Nair
Lay out, watch the kids like a daycare
I don't play games, no, I'm not the fair
I got Hot Wheels like a motherfuckin' chariot (Skrrt)
Chanel Vintage, boy, this shit is rare

Havin' the time of my motherfuckin' life

You can turn the ice tray off, baby, I'm havin' ice
As long as I live, wouldn't want a wife
