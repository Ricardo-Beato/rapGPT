It's Gucci, burr (Soulja Boy Tell'Em)
It's Gucci (Flocka)
Scott Storch, Gucci Mane, we back at it
Burr, So Icey (Yeah)

We smoking that fire endo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo, they scream "Bingo!"
Enzo, they scream "Bingo!"
Phantom, they scream "Bingo!"
Concept, they scream "Bingo!"
Pull up, kid scream "Bingo!"
Your ma would scream: "Bingo!"

Bingo, Bingo, Bingo, Bingo!
Bingo, Bingo, Bingo, Huh!
It's Gucci, It's Gucci (It's Gucci!)
Yoom, yoom, yoom
It's Gucci, Scottie, catch up
Burr! Burr! Bingo!

Hello, my watch yellow earrings on my bezel
Can’t fit in my schedule 'less booty like Jello
She know I slang kilos, shout out to my ‘migo
I call, he says "10-4", tight like Lamont Rollo
Murcielago for El Gato, my house like a brothel
Fat hoes in Chicago, first class to Morocco
Bingo called my motto, phantom with two models
Pull up tonight, stunt, jump out the car, scream guapo
You might also like
We smoking that fire endo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo, they scream "Bingo!"
Enzo, they scream "Bingo!"
Phantom, they scream "Bingo!"
Concept, they scream "Bingo!"
Pull up, kid scream "Bingo!"
Your ma would scream: "Bingo!"

Bingo, Bingo, Bingo, Bingo!
Bingo, Bingo, Bingo, Huh!
It's Gucci, It's Gucci (It's Gucci!) (Soulja)
Yoom, yoom, yoom (Soulja Boy Tell'Em)
It's Gucci, Scottie, catch up (And I hope I whi- And I hope I whip my pants out here)
Burr! Burr! Bingo!

Ridin in my Lambo, kids screaming "Bingo"
Haters wanna hate, they’ll get shot like a free throw
Candy paint wet, dripping off my headlights
Catch me in the trap like some motherfuckin' dead mice
Every time I cut a corner kids screaming "Bingo!
Tools on deck, I ain't talking Home Depot!
Soulja Boy Tell Em: I’m icey as an icicle
So much money, bitch, I valet park my bicycle
We smoking that fire endo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo, they scream "Bingo!"
Enzo, they scream "Bingo!"
Phantom, they scream "Bingo!"
Concept, they scream "Bingo!"
Pull up, kid scream "Bingo!"
Your ma would scream: "Bingo!"

Bingo, Bingo, Bingo, Bingo!
Bingo, Bingo, Bingo, Huh!
It's Gucci, It's Gucci (It's Gucci!)
Yoom, yoom, yoom
It's Gucci, Scottie, catch up
Burr! Burr! Bingo! (Flocka! Flocka! Flocka! Waka!)

All the hood hoes point like "Bingo"
Waka Flocka; “Oh Let’s Do It” is the single
Let’s mingle, got hoes like Wingo
My bitch a dime, your bitch like a cinco
Like a free throw, man I’m balling out
Blew a kiss to the girls, now they falling out
I pull up a T-top Cutlass like "Bingo"
My girlfriend Regal, same color of a flamingo
We smoking that fire endo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo, they scream "Bingo!"
Enzo, they scream "Bingo!"
Phantom, they scream "Bingo!"
Concept, they scream "Bingo!"
Pull up, kid scream "Bingo!"
Your ma would scream: "Bingo!"

Bingo, Bingo, Bingo, Bingo!
Bingo, Bingo, Bingo, Huh!
It's Gucci, It's Gucci (It's Gucci!)
Yoom, yoom, yoom
It's Gucci, Scottie, catch up
Burr! Burr! Bingo!3Embed
