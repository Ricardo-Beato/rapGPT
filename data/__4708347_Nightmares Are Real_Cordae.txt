43 ContributorsNightmares Are Real Lyrics
Okay, uh, I can tell you how I first started in this rap shit
Mama kicked a nigga out the house, felt fantastic
Told my homies, "If you got a couch, know I'm crashin'
Worried 'bout my future, couldn't care about the past tense
Lost my grandmother, and I haven't been the same since
Start to get anxious, I'm tired of this lame shit
Tired of the struggle, livin' family in the subdivision
Ramen noodles, drawin' doodles wasn't in my fuckin' vision
But who's fault is that? Tryna stay all intact
Fightin' all my demons, they be schemin' but I'm crawlin' back
And eventually flyin', lately been mentally cryin'
Niggas resentin' me, I am not for the industry lyin'

Life's a dream, but nothin' is a fairytale
Do you love me? I can barely tell
'Cause I'm up and down, been all around, nobody's callin' now
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Uh, 'cause I know what I been through
But I still, uh, I'd do it all over again
And my life is so sinful (YBN, why be them?)
But through times, uh (King Push)
The good guys always win
You might also like
I can tell you how I first started in this rap shit
8th grade, backflippin' on the mattress
9th grade, pack doin' gymnastics
10th grade, somersaultin' all them crack flips
Asterisk, skipped school, recorded with The Neptunes
We was makin' high school classics
Before I took a kilo and I wrapped it, I rapped it
Around the funeral with the casket (Yuugh!)
Coke avalanche, like a landslide
Only grew my hair this long because my man died
Collect calls on them landlines, I pressed 5
To tell about the new test drive and talk fly, ooh

Life's a dream, but nothin' is a fairytale
Do you love me? I can barely tell
'Cause I'm up and down, been all around, nobody's callin' now
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Uh, 'cause I know what I been through
But I still, uh, I'd do it all over again
And my life is so sinful
But through times, uh
The good guys always win12Embed
