One little, two little, three little putos
Tried to jack me, they got the boot though
Takin' no shit when push comes to shove
'Cause a nigga showed me no love
Step back, punk, 'cause I'm a Latino
What I bring you is the hardcore lingo
Funky, but ya don't understand
Now I gotta stand with the Glock in my hand
No scope, and there's no hope 'cause I'm dishin'
Out my .45 slug and it ain't missin'
Here it comes hissin'
Here it comes hummin' at ya
Now the slug is comin' at ya

One little, two little, three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
What do you know? Click-clack goes the gun
Make 'em run, boy, make 'em run, boy, make 'em run
You might also like
Cuando entro, loaded is the cuete
Speakin' to the gente
'Cause I'm insane in the mente
Movin' em back, click-click goes the gun
Make 'em run, boy, make 'em run, boy, make 'em run
It's no fun
When I got to break you off some
Of the pychobeta beatdown, boy, you get done
Serio, here we go
Come for the muchacho
I don't think you really want some of these chingazos
Me caso you don't hear this little lazo
Cypress Hill, breakin' you off a pedazo
Hummin' at ya
Don't make me come gat ya
Punk, 'cause I still will be comin' at ya

One little, two little, three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
What do you know? Click-clack goes the gun
Make 'em run, boy, make 'em run, boy, make 'em run

When I come in, kickin' with a vengeance
Rev up the engines
Comin' like the three little engines
Stompin' around on the ground on the plains
'Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
In the brain
So I gotta maintain my direction
What am I to gain without my protection?
Not a damn thing
So when I come, just bring
That new style, break ya off like a chicken wing (Bucock)
So you can just suck my cock
Like a fat blunt, stoned is the way of the walk
When I'm peepin'
Checkin' out the punk-ass creepin'
I let the dogs loose then I let the dogs sick 'em
Graah, nigga, don't make me catch ya
Punk, 'cause I still will be comin' at ya
One little, two little, three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
What do you know? Click-clack goes the gun
Make 'em run, boy, make 'em run, boy, make 'em runEmbed
