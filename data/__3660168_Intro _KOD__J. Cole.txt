71 ContributorsTranslationsEspa√±olItalianoIntro (KOD) LyricsCan someone please turn off my mind?
My thoughts are racing all the time
There is no reason or no rhyme
I'm trapped inside myself
A newborn baby has two primary modes of communication
Laughter, which says, "I love this"
Or crying, which says, "This frightens me, I'm in pain"
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely
At the bottom of the hourglass
Lies sand that represents the past
In which all of my demons rest
I'm calling out for help
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
