Truth decay brush up on your facts
All you gotta do is check them stats
But what sense is a census
When they just miss us
But enlist us to fight for their justice
Truth decay brush up on your facts
All you gotta do is check them stats
But what sense is a census
When they just miss us
But enlist us to fight for their justice

Truth is truth
No matter what I think
Knowledge is power
But it ain't
If you can't occupy your own body & mind
See thru the blind
In this place full a lies
Television tellin lies
To your vision and face
Seems like more of us in prison
Than the workplace
Gettin gadgets
So it's easy to forget
Economics
No money
Not a damn thing funny
Some diggin every minute of it
I'm hatin every second of it
Driven
Ever since I heard the lie about thanksgiving
While in still thankful through all that fibbin
The truth dies while lies make a living
History games
Playing stealing family names
Slave names turned into government names
You might also like
Truth decay brush up on your facts
All you gotta do is check them stats
But what sense is a census
When they just miss us
But enlist us to fight for their justice
Truth decay brush up on your facts
All you gotta do is check them stats
But what sense is a census
When they just dismiss us
But enlist us to grow and pick their stuff

Truth is truth
No matter what I think
I ain't drunk
Cause I don't drink
Don't smoke
Or
Laugh at the facts like stupid ass jokes
Or get lost in my own sauce, I check the source
I challenge information
Trace it to the boss
Refuse to accept the truth
When it be be lost
Lies in the key of new songs
You think it's old news
How come the young don't know
It ain't new because you never knew
I tell them ,it's only new to you
Opinion is what it is and its up to you
The challenge information
To see if it's true
Never have so many been screwed by so few
You heard im using it for this song too
Damn crooks
Ask a question get some stupid ass looks
Truth don't sell a lotta records or books
To hell with rapes to murder rates
To lyin on a mixtapes
I want the truth
Truth decay brush up on your facts
All you gotta do is check them stats
But what sense is a census
When they just miss us
But enlist us to fight for their justice
Truth decay brush up on your facts
All you gotta do is check them stats
But what sense is a census
When they just dismiss us
But enlist us to grow and pick their stuffEmbed
