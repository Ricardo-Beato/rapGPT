Lock, load, ready to aim at any target
I could get your brains for a bargain like I bought it from Target
Hip hop is my supermarket
Shopping cart full of fake hip-hop artists
I'm starving, sorry, I gotta eat all it
And I'll be back in the morning

Flow so sick, make you wanna throw your food up
Ice water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup
Two twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut
I get bread like cold cuts, you know what?

They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter of fact, they never made it like me before
I'm rare, like Mr. Clean with hair
No brake lights on my car rear
I never had life and I never had fear
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven, I swear
And yeah, I'm a bear, like black and white hair, so I'm polar
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar
I am so far from the othars, I meant others
I just eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover

Love him he's God gift
Though they hate I love it
It make me drive faster
They won't catch the F50 Ferrari
I got on Ferrari glasses
Mashing through New Orleans like it's Cali
I'm just trying to keep up with the fashions
Got my music blasting
Televisions flashing
I'm watching The Passion
Me I get my hot box game up when I flame up
Shame lil niggas at the red light change up
See everyone was around when I was down
Now it's lonely at the top since I came up
Look up, they trying to look me up and hook up look
I ain't got a nose for your boogers I'm sugar
That mean I'm good, if you is I'm gooder
Should've, would've, could've, but you didn't, cocksucker
This is that old south I'm talking with that old slang
Pushing that new thing, shitting on my old hoes
Pissing off my old homies
The game is fair but it's cold get your winter garments
Still can't warm it
See I'm a break from the norm
My LA girls they say I’m so bomb, they eat tofu
The 40/40 on a special day
Them cheap niggas I'll still slide 500 to Desiree
I talk shit and I don't never hate
Cause I would forklift whoever face
See I ain't rich yet
Oh but I'm ballin now and that get your bitch wet
We just trying to see how many dicks she can bench press
See I'm a business
Dogs I’m a bitchness
I ain't a rest haven I let the rest save them
Mack Maine hit me with the trap game
Now I'm having second thoughts about the fucking rap game

Leaving them in the ocean with pistols dripping
With all these bannana clips and we ain't slipping
Foggy behind the tints, good grief
So you blow o's of the leaf I blow a wreathe
Sheesh, Great Scott, is he a theif?
It seems like he got a mouth full of gold teeth
Chyea, shout out to Cee Lo Green

Take 'em to church

Momma don't cry

Grandpa gone and grandma ain't coming home today
But
Don't worry cause your son’s still the one
Though I'm under the gun I'm aiming for the sun
Dwayne Micheal Jr, born that
But I changed my name to Wayne
And nigga I ain't goin back
I'm kinda little but I figured I’d be bigger if I sold crack
So I sold that
OG’s from the block told me "Youngin hold that"
So I held dat
Got on front street and then I fell back
Became well at cookin it til it smell flat
Vaseline it up and ship it out in gel packs
I failed at what the teacher used to yell about
Junior High was prison
High school was the bail out
But my momma knew her baby boy was fresher
Than a baby bottom in new Pampers on campus

Waiting for the chance to get to tell her
I'm the one she should be with, oh
She's popular with all the guys
So innocent in my eyes
I can see her in my life
She would'a had the world if she were mine
But see, she had other plans, I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door

She didn't realize she chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties, tryin' to apologize

We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit

Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby

Now she don't know about me but I'ma put her on it
And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby

Well, alright, here I go

I'm a rapper-turned-singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal cords, all I hit is C-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm pre-voked
I'm about to change the fucking game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, that's the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are postgame
MoneyOverBitches dot com, check the domain
It's coming too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, "Yeah, once in a blue moon"
Oops, I mean a red moon, I did it again, Tune
Let me leave a space in for your Blood affiliation, I state
Heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I could rap around these other young'un's like a cobra snake
Frostbite Drizzy, nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in-line, don't be tryna roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit, I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me, who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you could tell I'm real
'Cause I'm gettin' hood love and I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young Angel, Young Lion, I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin', who's drinkin'? 'Cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' Jon B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This for all the strippers 'cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em, "Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it"
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back-and-forth faxes
My money coming full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby, I'ma kill 'em, only 'cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles in the booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this

And 18 G's is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know 'bout it? My niggas so about it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars, baby, I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy, obviously, pop one at your Ivy League
I don't have a rivalry, if so, you'll have a cah-sualty
Oops, I meant "a casualty," oops, I meant catastrophe"
Oops, I meant, actually, you niggas is just ass to me
And big, wet pussy is more like what I'm rather-ing
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying

Plus I wanna make it clear that every artist you hear on Young Money is most likely to be doing their own thing somewhere else so what I would love for you to do is to get, don't just listen to them over here actually get into them and see what they're doing everywhere, cause if they're good over here most likely they're great there. I mean so, pay attention to 'em, they're makin moves. They're makin moves. And if you wanna be down with us, it's easy. It's easy. Give a nigga some head or somethin. Haha. No homo, not to the niggas though I ain't lookin for no more rappers. I don't even wanna try, I'm straight. I'm lookin for straight, beautiful women. Naw I'm lyinYou might also likeEmbed
Where's my coffee?
Good morning, Dr. Carter (Hey, sweetie)
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, another one huh? What we got
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts (Uh-huh)
Originality (Ugh)
His flow is weak (Another one)
And he has no style (Ugh)
What you got for him? (Tssss, okay)

Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great, uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace, one, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix wherever your shell break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey, brighter than a sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday, gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gotta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him
(Dial 118 please)

Good afternoon, Dr. Carter (Nurse)
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lacks respect for the game
(Uh, let me see)
You think you can save him?

Okay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'ma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid, plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something
'Cause you just like it, so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting, my passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin, like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it
God dunnit I've lost another one
Good evening, Dr. Carter. It's been a long day
But this one looks much better than the others
His respect is back up, concepts sound good
His style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then
Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese, erection
Fashion patrol, police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby, don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to write, too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice, swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow, his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life, where's the stitches? Here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply "What a night"
"Welcome back, Hip-Hop, I saved your life"
He looks good, his vitals are up
He's looking good, he's looking good
I think we got one
Dr. Carter, I think we got one
Yep, yep, we got one, we saved him, he's good
He's good, we got one, he's good
He's good, we got him
We saved him, he's a go
He's good36Embed

Because...and what I mean by everybody else I mean everybody else that does what we does
You know, this recordin' industry, music, thing
What I do is, I don't go out to the clubs
And when you do see me in the club, trust me, I have been paid to be there for those thirty minutes that you enjoyed with me
I don't stay inside for nothin' couse my house is nice
I don't just get in my cars and just ride around neighborhoods where no girls are at, because my car is nice
I don't do that
What I do is, I go to studio
And I just stay in the studio
See you have to understand the difference
The difference between me and you is to you, this is your job
To me, this is my life
The club; that's my job
The mall; that's my job
Your neighborhood; that's my job
This studio; this is my life
This is what I do better than anything
So why wouldn't I do this all the time?

But where I'm from, lost city of New Orleans...we call him this:
Georgia (That's right) Georgia (Bush)

I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lotta stealing going on
Boy them cops is killas in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and President (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady?
Why wasn't they able to control this?

Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin'
Spend a condo in the club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patron, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that rage flow

And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes

Reading all the red lights, trying not to give up
But I don't know how long it's gonna last, oh
It's almost over now
I say it's almost over now
The end is gettin' closer now
Better do what you supposed to 'cause the world is oh-so short now

Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end?
Runnin', run it all
Yeah! I'm runnin' out of time, I'm runnin' out of space
Feel like I'm runnin' 'round, but I'm runnin' in place
We all in the race, I'm just another sprinter
If there's no finish line, then who's the real winner?4Embed

Make the shy girls horny, make the fly girls corny
And only for me
Because of who I A-M, holla back in the morning
Hey! Now holla back if you own shit

The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lamb', I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters

Lord, oh, Lord
Am I talkin' crazy? Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest

I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, "Be quiet, we need our privacy"
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, hook you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

Uh, glory, hallelujah

My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users

Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait, it wasn't

You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter—better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's world, she say, "What is this world coming to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
"What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate, we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear, I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of... my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet

But why these snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these nigga's, wake me up when it's all over

Street sweepers and millimeters, AK's and skateboards
Let 'em know we got beef for anyone who got a taste for it
Real nigga to the bone, bristle
Cocaine, like co cripple
Heard niggas been waitin' on me, well I might as well go and tip 'em
I'm smokin' on that Hulk Hogan
I call shots, you call forward
I pimp my ride, my car's ho-in'
And all my bars be barcoded
These YMCMB stars glowin'
Hate a ho-nigga, like anchovies
My young bitch keep on snappin' on me, I told that bitch I ain't posing
That pussy feel like a pot of gold
The money old and the night is young
All them niggas keep talkin' shit
I make you eat your words and bite your tongue
And when the guns ring I'm the ring leader
Got those ho's on pins and needles
I'm so high I left Earth
And ran into Venus and Serena
Get head like a mind reader
You washed up, I'm the dry cleaner
Don't worry about me, nigga I'm one-
Hundred like a high fever
Got pounds takin' up closet space
Guns all in my bitch crib
Since all you nigga's fly now, bugs all on my windshield
And if she tense, then I'mma rub her back
She alright, I think I fuck with her
Man, I wish a motherfucker would
I feel like a hockey puck nigga
Way too cold to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cold to die young, give these niggas the cold shoulder
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, another bitch when I roll over
We fuck until we fall asleep, wake up and do it all over

Nigga I be hard on a ho 'cause a bitch ain't shit
And every ho I done fucked done sucked my dick
I had to pour out some drank for niggas I miss
I hope my weed ain't too loud to hear the snakes hiss
It's Dedication 5, medication high
I gotta clean up after these niggas 'cause they be wasting time
And boy, my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line
I'm shining on these hoes so hard they getting tan lines
It's Tunechi, I go hard, I put in work
Twin Glocks, the gift and the curse
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt
We geeked up, the revenge of the nerds
I swear, play with these niggas, that's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food
I got the power, but a short fuse, let's go
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the Feds
You know snitches get stitches, nigga, needle and thread
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't too proud to beg
Alright, fucking right, shoot you up at the light
Straight take all your possessions, call that shit Poltergeist
And my homie, he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes
I call my bitch Plane Jane 'cause she catch nut like a flight
I'm on a mission to get movie money, stick to the script
Your bitch leaking information, I just follow the drip
Soon as I get that coupe, I'mma go get the rims
Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his
I feel like He-Man when I'm in your ho
And tell that bitch give me my space, like a telescope
In her throat like Ricola, my system solar
I'm too young to die sober, your man a cobra
Watch that nigga, let's go
Boy, my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians
Straight blowing money fast, I'mma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper, I'mma smack a nigga
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket, flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's telling jokes
I swear to God, I put in work
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert
I spit these bars, this a uni-verse
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke
I'm telling ya, shout out Turk
It's Hot Boys, bitch, the block is hot
If I ain't have the keys to success I would have picked the lock
Diarrhea, shit don't stop, until my fucking casket drop
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'mma pass the rock

‘Cus this shit’s startin to take a toll

Make you spit that safe combination, out like Listerine
And even though I’m not an artist this is where I draw the line
We don’t feel none of you niggas
Y'all some fuckin porcupines
I still got residue all on my dinner plates
Real niggas in my inner circle
None of my checks come late, I ain’t having that, I give em curfews
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress
Surprise yo ass like a baby… taking his first steps
I’m too good for just any bad bitch
Smoke like I’ve been kissing dragons
That milk carton show her missing panties
That pussy felt like a hidden valley
Thank God that I’m so gifted
I wouldn’t return a single gift
But all good things must come to an end
Like this blunt burning my fingertips

Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short

And she said, "Tune, not in my mouth," damn you should've said it sooner

Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except Heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten

Yeah
Suffix, people
Chyeah
You know
You, you, you already
Yeah
C'mon

Kicking rocks on the block, telling all the OGs:
"I be coming for your spot when you're not looking"
Hot cooking, mama got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable, too
Nintendo when them good grades came through
Then the cooked Ks came through
Some soft, some stepped-on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
Thought I heard niggas coming, thought I saw the cop lights, but
I was dreaming, then I woke
The junkies was still fiending, and I had coke so
I had hope; you may say that its wrong
But I ain't talking to your child, I'm talking to this song
I'm just doing a buck down memory lane
If I crash, just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do, then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway, and I would do the honors any day
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the stage like I whip through the yay
Show your ass how to take four and get eight
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
The only Hot Boy eating off this plate: Young
Weezy Baby, that's what your bitch say
Give her ass a location and a temp plate
Show her how to work the interstate
Stop working with that thinner weight, get your brakes fixed
Stop playing, 'cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while you full and my clip gon' be empty
When the stomachs get empty, anything's tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kids' sake
Hurricane wiped us out like a earthquake
We tryna save face, but we ain't got a place
To stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way, pussies, relocate
Y'all know us, when you see us, put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good, nigga, think about the hood, nigga
The people who ain't never had shit, ain't gon' never have shit
Bullshit, 'cause they still gon' try to manage
Niggas doing anything, like, God gon' understand 'em
But please understand this: niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothing lost families, lives lost in traffic
Water up to the attic, there goes the stashes
But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce-back seeming like magic
Shit... Well, call me Siegfried
Watch how I turn one key to a hundred Gs
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze:
Summer, please, know I live for you
Throw on the wife-beater, let back the lid for you
A few years I probably hear from you, but now I'm here for you
I know niggas that shed a tear for you
Behind bars, tryna get to you, and probably never see you
This that real talk if you ever heard it, homie
Shit hurts so much, might have to hurt you, homie
No commercial, no fronting, no curve on it
No cut; tell life, "So what?"
The drought's here; not only white's slowed up
The weed's slowed up, we can't even roll up
Fuck it, put a dent in the money too
But that's the last thing 'cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what? How we getting on?
Where he sitting at? What he sitting on?
Stand up if you know it's true
The end of the world coming, and my city the proof, damn
Shit... And this is after disaster
This ain't rap, this a recap
Stepping off the G4, still strapped
Bust your head in the air, that's a sky-cap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off, 'cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon' eat
Then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reaching
And I'ma get there through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything pause, I'm proceeding
I'm a leader, meet the son of Jacida
Fuck the world, not the people, damn!You might also like1Embed

Everyday pushing me, pushing me

Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
I say pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
You gotta pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that
No ceilings

Okay: Cool & Dre, this is No Ceilings
I do this all day; I got bars, no railings
Looking for a bitch for some sexual healing
Open up her mouth and she catch it like Braylon
Young Weezy F, the 'F' is not for failing
Swagger just dumb, call it Sarah Palin
If you niggas fly, then I must be parasailing
We-We are not the same, I'm a mutherfucking alien
Back on my saddle with my tool in my hand
Uptown real nigga, bitch, landed in the sand
Back home, nigga, did it for the land
For the grand with the money with the tool in my hand
High life, give a fuck about your stripes, homie
Killer kill, killer spend your bin daily, homie
Turn left get your switch turned off, nigga
Turn right and get your shit took off, nigga
Fuck Grey Goose, cause we higher than we ever been
More loaded, white doves, burning hundreds
Overseas nigga pitching on the top floor
High floor situation from the bottom floor
Born in the middle, shining like a diamond
Red diamonds, big diamonds how we roll, nigga
On 24s, fucking all these hoes, nigga
High life: getting money then we go, nigga

Hurt no, hurt no
I dont wanna hurt no, hurt no
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
I dont wanna hurt nobody tonight
I dont wanna hurt nobody tonight
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
Everyday pushing me, pushing me3Embed

Two bitches on my arm, get my Don Juan on
Watch the hoes go crazy when the boy song on
Multicolored stones on, we getting money, yeah

Let her do what she like, then I have my way with her
I ain't trying to play with her, I ain't trying to stay with her

So give me MySpace like dot com

Like you can't touch this, like you can't touch us with a pipe
But we can touch whoever we like
You could even do Lil Chuckee, Lil Twist, KY, Bobby V

Hi! My name is—you know what my name is
Bitch, I'm famous, like Tom Brady
And hi—your name is? Not important
Who cares? Not Weezy Baby, ugh

I'm reporting out of shorty, she so naughty, me so horny
Kilo on me like I'm Tony, break it down to Rice-A-Roni
Take her out, look like she lonely
I'm gon' candlelight the moment
I'ma vandalize the pussy
She told him "My phone was roaming," ugh
She be moaning 'til the morning, I be goin' in
I be on it, I be in it, I'm like Foreman on the grill

Alright; alright, alright, alright

The title's up for grabs, I’m into confiscation
Punch, shot, and stab; now you're the doctor's patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin'
And these niggas ain't shit, like they're constipated
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light, that's when I be headed
So far ahead of them I feel outdated
But I feel electric like I’m Rayden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I’m coming out the faders, no homo

No preventin' the grind, I gotta get it
I'm admitted to the game, true player, no quittin'
There you go shittin' on the way a nigga thinkin'
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
And since the future ain't promised to no one
I live every day like this is the sure one
Trade in the tidal wave, this is the ocean
Stand in that heat 'til the motherfucking snow come
And it feels so fuckin' good
Throw my dope like a rope, let 'em tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches
Running 'cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune
Come and get it, automatics in motion
We bangin' for the bread, nigga, even the molded

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me, you are the brightest star under sunlight
See, take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
See, this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back

You've been hiding (Y'know)
Never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin', it mama)
To keep it under control (But I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)

But I hope you haven't forgot about me—
Up in the living room, watchin' SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver; you know, they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me "butter," I called you "babe"
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say:
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn!

Mushroom bullets hit your body, and they spread
Then your ass dead, no need for a hospital room or a bed
Just tell his mama, "Get him some nice threads"
So at least he'll be a bitch-ass nigga dying in style
He didn't want to look up to me, now he gotta look down
Somebody better tell 'em: On these beats, I'm a beast
Half-man, half-animal like King on "Tekken"
I'll wreck him, and yeah, Young Money is what I'm reppin'
Respect 'em or I'll put you on that highway to Heaven
Matter of fact, pussy, you'll get your own lane
With no speed limits, so you can get there in a minute, ha
It's Dedication 3, it's no replacing we
That's like asking a group of Muslims, "Where that bacon be?"
Straight Grand Patrón flow, it's no chasin' me
And that amnesia is what my medication be
That's that Amsterdam grade-A, I'm smoking in the Netherlands
So high that I'll probably fucking never land, bitch!

Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B
If you want it then come to me
I'm right here


I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips
The kid is a nuisance
Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music
And The Blueprint
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit
Like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez

And Baby bout to buy me a house in the sky
Cuz I'm so fly
When my feet touch the ground sometimes I gotta ask myself why
Coupe kinda wide but I move sorta quick
Looking for my roof where it went
Mink on the floor big shoes on the bed
Windows are the tint more wood than a bench
Working in the hood more green than the Grinch
Please don't play cuz I'm connected like Sprint
Ladies on the tray popping up the back-end
Peppermint leather with a feather in my brim
It's Lil Weezy
Somethin' on my wrist real breezy
And this is what I say when you see me
Look, and leave your broad at home she get took
Cuz I'm a player hold the game by the book


Some call me Weezy
But hoes holla look at Lil Wayne
In that booger-green lay like should've been Mace
Sweet, do speak when I should've put trays
Forget it I'mma slam it on bubba-bubba-blaze
So move over what you say shortie
We could do rent pussy
Normally I wouldn't but beating through the Texas
And beating went to the A
Eat with Jazze Pha
But yeah I'm on my way
Cuz I know he got that hay
Hey little mami
You a ghetto fire tin
You come to my post on the island
Come on that chronic
He-he empty vodka bottles
I be high he be drunk that my roll model
I rolls by you with my seat reclining
When I stop rims don't keep spinning they keep shining
Money don't stop keep spinning and keep grinding
Cash Money what you hollering, huh

Look right here, this how we gon do this
Hook up the turn tables, whoof get on the keyboard
And we gon run this for you, ya heard?
Yeah, check it out

Cash Money...

Cash Money...
Cash Money...

Ay, let me slide in the Benz with the fished-out fins
Hit the mall wit my girlfriends, dish out ends
Cause you know it ain't trickin if you got it
Copped baby girl what she desired
It's chump change ma, marijuana scholar
Know'n what I got up in my styrofoam cup - that purple stuff
It was given to me at birth to stunt
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the furry cups

Hey, hold on mami them whips on dubs
Cadillac Truck, 28's, no rubs
Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eyed lens
Car show in New York, y'all know who wins
It's the Birdman daddy, with the Gucci Prada
Slant back Cup Truck, no rims - can't holla
It's that Louie Fendi on Ostrich streets
It's the tailor-made daddy, mami do you love me?

Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stunt, no, no

Pop one, pop two with the new Nike shoes
Royal blue jag on 'em 22's
Slippers, white to breate, 500 Degreez
In that Cadillac Truck on 'em 23's
I'm the boss of the game with the money and fame
All these, naked women that pop champagne
And these, marble floors stay high as Rick James
If you know my name then you know my game

It's lil whoadie from the hot block with serious flow
Gotta get dough, cha'll won't feel me broke
But, y'all don't hear me though
Til I'm rolling down my window where my grill is show
And you know I probably pump it through the hood on them 24's
Word, rims poking out the side of the err
Glock, have ya ribs poking out the side of your shirt
I'm a 17 nigga and I ride through the turf
Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stunt, no, no

Hey, and my pinky glow cause my rings is so...
Blingy blingy, yo stop blinking though
We smoke stinky stinky dro
And we don't cop them incy wincy o's
And we don't stop, nah, we blow
Fuck the pee-ple
Everywhere we go we smell like ick yo
Birdman, my Paw so that make me go.. fly like an eagle, fasheezy

See they think cause I stay English turn
That stunna don't ever OZ to burn
I go in each over and ball like a dog
Me and my niggs ball like a dog
Cars on my streets, all on the lawn
Ice in my teeth, all on my arm
Tats in my face, my back and my arm
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stunt, no, no

Yo, there it is, ya lil' low life
See, I'm a Bro-fessional - you a rookie
Fuck, a game so serious I could sell a hooker some pussy
That's some serious shit
Oh yeah, believe that
Who we rollin wit?
We rollin wit Cash Money
Oh, I forgot about peace - Peace!
I mean.. piece of pussy, piece of land, piece of property
Just a mind game
Piece of mind, ya know
Piece of something, motherfucker!4Embed
It's H-B Weezy Wee off the streets

Gator seats polar bear floors
I faithfully hold to pimp whores
You ate with me and you gon get yours

Got haze in me now I'm so tall
Come blaze with me cuz Beaky got more
And now or later I'm major player
I ball right I need an agent player
Ay ma you tight you need to page a player
That's so tonight you can taste a player
I got the burner on the waist if you flinching
My shit turning on 28-inches
My shit burning like 500 plus
And this album's a three permer and a clutch

24/7 (Yes, sir)
I go hard (Go hard, go hard, go hard)
Not here

I claim squad game till no more Wayne remain
Bang my thing till no more lane remain
Use the left lane man cook up the cocaine
Dudes a lil game and get her to do brain
That boy Weezy is a bad mother-feezy
Me and Young Jazze at the back of one tweezy
I'm so breezy off the Velvie and the perk
Now I'm getting head on the balcony on Bourbon
Apple and Eagle is the street that I shop
The Birdman my daddy and we fly south
And we don't go to work man we get work out
And the bricks may go as low as ten up in the drought
Niggas is selling and you should be buying
Niggas is telling and you should be dying
Niggas is yelling Cash Money till they kill me

I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number
After how she made them daisy dukes fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didn't come easy
'Cuz she ended up being my baby's mother
And then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix...laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers dont know shit
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me (What?)
My love, my patience, my pain (OK)
Nigga please

Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good...I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard...I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life...the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit (Shit)
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it..she ain't want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody

Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy

Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do

Love pussy but you dont love them ho's
Love ya niggas love ya children

I'll take your bitch, give her back, take your bitch again
That's because you throw a 5, I pitch a 10
Now she wanna get inside of me 66
She see my wrist is blue and yellow like Michigan
She say she love her man, she misses him
But nobody do it better than her distance dick, me
I'm her long distance pimp
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip, yup
And I don't lie I confess
I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress
Gotta dress to impress though
Gotta stay clean, plus mami in a Lex 4
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death
It's the Birdman Jr., sincerely yours

Have you hangin' 'round a bunch of yayo buyers, nope
And not a day go by us

Cut your telephone off, we ridin'

You sleeping in a tee and a thong
With your hair in a pony

Hop in my shit and say goodbye 'cause the ceiling's leaving (Gangsta!)
Believe me, they ain't tryna see me
Tell 'em I be the nigga with the burner in the beanie, I'm—
The fireman, she just call me when she steamin
I wet her up and put her out and leave the bitch dreaming
Niggas say they hot, but it's really not seeming
If these guys bad, then I gotta be a demon
Wayne's getting money like Damon and Keenan
Try, take it from me, and I'm aiming and beaming
Banging and leaving stains on the cement
Slide the crackers something so they tame the policemen
Left in a Porsche, came in a carnation
I'm fresh, yeah, the Gucci sweats came with the creases
I'm hot, but I'm cold, I just change with the seasons
Tryna put some cheese on my pieces
If you looking for your nigga, I be where the water gets deeper
Hugging on that money, tryna put it in a sleeper
Yeah, I'm here—who the fuck wanna say something?
Leave your whole head empty like a straight pumpkin
Make no assumptions, I'm hustling
Your girlfriend guzzling when you thought she wasn't
Name still buzzing even when I'm doing nothing
But I'm never doing nothing, 'cause I'm always getting money
It's that simple, jackass, if you don't get it, you're a dummy
And them niggas that diss me ain't nothing but pure pussy
Sure, honey, I done heard what you said
But if a nigga really cared, you'd already be dead
Just a young-ass nigga with some old-ass bread
Yes, I keep them dollars running like them bitches got legs
And my nigga Tez Po been riding with me since pegs

White and yellow diamonds, adjust your lighting

And I learned how to create it
And all that pot's for me
So come see, or come eat
And I hope that she is having the ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come on now, who did you
Where did you, why did you
What did you think she was
That's your ho
But does her water help your garden grow? No
Yeah I know that was crazy
But I think you are more crazier than her

Passin' all day up Latoya's Street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Had me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my ten-speed bike
Who knew I'd be pedaling the six-speed white
Big dog through the yard where the little dogs bite
So if you are female dog, you don't fight

No homo, but please blow me to Japan
Okay, I'm getting hotter, I'ma need another fan

Always trying to be better than I am
Label me the best and in the throne, I will stand
Why? Because I'm just a stand-up guy

You only know me, but God knows I try
No X-ray show my insides
And I gotta stay in touch with my pimp side
So, tell your girl I said, "What's up? I said hi"

Spit like I'm tryna tongue-kiss this rhyme
Some say greatness gets better with time
So I bought a zillion watches but don't watch mine

Nickel plus four is a nine millimeter
No starch but I tote i-ron
All out in the open like I'm in Iran
Young, champ-i-on, like a lamp I'm on
But, um, I could clap and then—lights off
Take no nights off, but my days the same
And people change but fuck it, nothing stays the same
And naw, I ain't speaking so don't waive the blame
Lock me up but you could never cave the blame
Gasoline, can you invision if our gaze was flames
No, you cannot stop my vibe, couple page a game

And you ain't gotta call me the greatest, man
But I am more of a dog than the greatest dane

Crying like you 'bout to have babies, man
And you can find me grinding on the days we playin'
And that's because I know the sun will raise again

Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the law's comin', hey, it's time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, out of control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuos

You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick
Or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', "Where's this bastard's crack?!!"
I flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, "Slut! Where's the yay, or I'mma pop one in your grill!"
It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas
Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga
If you out, you can find me on the street with the work
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt
Smell me?

And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now

Who fuck with us?
Weed, liquor done corrupted us
Wet a nigga like umbrellas
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man
Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man
Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it
Niggas be kiddin' – me awake, DOA
Gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face
Oh, shit - niggas on that ho shit
Fours spit so quick like that lil' nigga ain't got no sense
Slow this shit down - let me get back down to reality:
I cause fatalities for any technicality
Wipe off your family randomly - U Understand?
It ain't a motherfuckin' game, and I ain't fuckin' playin'
Come on!
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Them can't fuck with me now - ah, they can't fuck with me now
Look-
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was

Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
They can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya

You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now

Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth
Get erased, my nigga (my nigga)

No witnesses so can you see my face, my nigga (my nigga)
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga

I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'mma take to my grave
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, "Juvenile, stay off them streets."
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', "Fuck the police!"
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed
All they understand is my project English
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis

I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'mma sneak ya, nigga
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga
Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas
And empty a hundred out that K
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me
I've been in the game - niggas know what I'm 'bout
So many murders under my belt, I done lost count
If you wanna be another number, my nigga

Hello, world
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy
Glock cookin', boy
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'
Spark or lace somethin'
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
Cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With bars we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)

You know I, been had Twinkie, look at the pinky
And the link be all the way down to the nuts, diamonds twinklin'
They think you need to stop they say it's not called for
It's such a small car, but cost more than a ballpark
See my life is high priced, a lot a room a lot a bling
My ice is like Andrew Dice "Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing"
You'll probably see me flying in a Lamborghini
Wit your girl right beside me in a tan bikini
Cut the music down and tell her, "hey ya man's a weenie"
Plus I'm hot and got more iceberg than damn Bananeeie
And I'm just a teenager and I make this dough
Pull out my bankcard and Bill Gates feel broke
And I keep it on a hush but I'm richer than normal
And a frost bit wrist, have me sniffin and coughin (*cough*)

And suck a nigga drive, then its, "slut get out my ride"
Have you heard about, shorty be Iceberged out
Got them birds real affordable, so get the word out
And you still can see the grill wit the lights burn out
Nothin' lil' about the wheels on my bright orange drop
I'm thuggin and pimped out, flossin and glissed out
Sit my arm in warm water, I'm thawin my wrist out
Got quarters in this house, ki's in that van
Got ounces in her ride, and G's in that bag

Slump the bitch over, cum on her shoulder
Bet I make the slut eat it up like yogurt
Wrists is ferocious, dick is just bogus
Fuck a ho watch she come back like a chorus
Like one named Deloris met her in a taurus
She like to snort coke, you should see the size her nose is
We really the ones controllin', no choices
And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention
All our rides are dubbed like blank tapes
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common
Cuz everytime you put them bitches on they start shinin'

And tomorrow I'mma hit the block and borrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people
Seventeen Creeper is who I - what I - be, dog
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog
On four tires, or feet, dog
I still be on the block sweepin'
Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
Cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
And passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead
But, dog, you get it raw if you war with the kid
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge
Huh?!

Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun

Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T
On the back street of your block in the back seat
I'mma cap three at the first coward I up and see
I'mma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip
I know you see me: Little Weezy kill 'em all easy
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know
Huh? Huh? Huh?

Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun

Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
For the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin' from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice

Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools

I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
See me just off the meters
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's Glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty, I carry one
Come to kill up everyone

Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools

Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Weezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip cause they breathe and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the Glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house

Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues1Embed
Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
Or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
And z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Weez - anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicodins, Valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people
When I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'mma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind

I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind

And if we beef, we don't beef long cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
Cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than "The Three Lil Pigs'" last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga - Weezy Wee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind

Tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time

Nigga, I'm on the grind
Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'mma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time

I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine

Runnin' from the scene, Hammer in my jeans
Dead bodies behind me, the cops'll never find me
Arm & Hammer Clean on my way to the honeycombe
Hustle all night tell my bitch I'm never coming home
Be there in the morning, stop cryin' bitch
The sun is home, drop it on the living room table
Bitch the money home, I know you ain't gon' stay once the money gone
So while I'm rich I pull my dick and get my fuckin' on
Youngin' on some real "Gangsta Gangsta" shit
Blame it on the neighborhood I was sanctioned in
But I'mma make sure we get them acres
Tell 'em fuck computers, we good with paper
Tell 'em fuck the world cause I'm hood by nature
Feelin' that way is how the hood'll make ya
The hood is vacant, the streets are empty, yeah
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but

Yeah, over like yesterday floatin' to the floodgates
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state
A blood bath, and you ain't nothin' but tub bait
No political justice not even the judge safe
If his ass can't swim he get a closed case
We need our own space, I ain't talkin' about Jupiter
No luck, no help and we the fuckin' future
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one
But when I need it, I turn into a looter
God forgive, but do he forgive the brutal
Even when it's for the better of your junior
Soon you see that life's just another movie
And the main character dies at the end, usually
There's nothin' that haven't been done that you can do to me

I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate it up like some peanuts
I said "oooohhhh Kisha"
Chopped off like a millimeter
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro, oh no I got to keep her
Told her l'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go you to sleep, I got some more meat to feed ya

But she didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin' it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin out
He saw me peepin at him, but he didn't open his mouth
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Sayin to myself look at this dog ass ho

Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cuz she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car all smellin
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees

My niggas don't give a Jean-Claude Van Damme
About'chu, cause we don't play around
Bring tha K around, spray tha town, take tha ground
Take tha ground that you walk on
Tap tha phones that you talk on
Jam ya up and take your arms off

And your neck, and just watch your head fall off... fall off

Let him know if (let him know if) he down bad, that ain't my problem
Let him know if he come at me bad, then I'mma chop him
Ch-uh.. chop him
Put tha flame to him
All of a sudden tha thing hits straight through him
Cause I'm tha same nigga, pimper boy, Lil' Wayne
Thugged out, pants fall to my shoe strings
But since I usually... do the best at thangs
That mean I gotta wear a vest at thangs
I really think them niggas jealous... of tha sparkle in my necklace
Yall ain't ready.. yall ain't readyEmbed
Raj Smoove (Yeah)
The greatest DJ in the world (Yeah)
Ooh boy (Yes!)
We about to say a prayer for all our loved ones
I'mma call this one "Real Rap"
Anybody you lost, put 'em on your heart
Because this rap is real, you know?
Light it up for 'em
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know
You ain't never too alive to die, heh

Listen, I grew up where the people call them people on us
Think we slangin', but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Living like the videos, write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us
Ghetto bird still shittin' on us
Government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies, and the grief's still sittin' on us
So we got their names written on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitchass police K9's teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy rolled a L
Beezy ain't here — Where's Beezy at? Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back with my nigga
But I know that's how it happened, my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin', my nigga
But now they all rappin', my niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sailboat flappin', my nigga
No fingers, I'm snappin'
Happy for my nigga Lil Tagus
'Cause even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shit, found his body like a month later
Rest in peace, boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin'
And I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin' the flow
So if I cry, don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped a beat
My nigga Lil Derek was quick to cop a ki
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his momma's fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time, I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
'Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can
Thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yeah, and fuck a man with a badge
'Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The 5-0 killed Naudy, good boy dead
Man, you would've thought they killed cornbread
Shot him up, face down on the lawn
Not to mention, with his handcuffs on
Not to mention, they had plain-clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin' iPod
Shit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun license, haha, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera —
Stay still motherfucker
I'mma have to write my will this summer
'Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yeah, and you can put that on my late Father
Or my late Grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter
Or my Grandfather, Larry Balsock
The old man hustled 'til his heart stopped
And all I know of my real Pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
'Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama, how it's supposed to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't ever wanna see her mope for me
Hopefully, but, truthfully
There is a day that's due for me
But we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weezy F. Baby
Amen

Got a Heaven-sent flow, though it's Hell on Earth
So, with that in mind, I don't live for Prada
I'm trying to stack and mack, and got stigmata
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes, when I flow, they say the southern Big's popped up
They tell me "don't get murked, or get locked up"
But I'm from Holly Grove, I can't give the block up (Holly Grove)
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck
I'ma ride with my Glocks up

Eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs, guns up in my trench
When niggas play, they get drenched
My pockets is full of lint

What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Balling 'til my hair is as white as Johnny Carson
You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, "Don't mind the little voices," woah

What's harder, love or Mr. Carter?
Especially when these hoes ain't right, these hoes ain't loyal
Shit, who's wrong? Who's right? Just ask my lawyer
Right or wrong, I'm still gon' take his advice, he take my orders
I'll be a-okay instead of alright, or kinda-sorta
And before I ever take that for granted, I take the charges
See, you can't believe in all of the hype you hear at the barber
If the odds are stacked against us, they're likely to stack 'em on us
Lil Tune, Jurassic in the room, Tyrannosaurus

Tune in this bitch, let's spike the Holy Water

Shit, what's harder, murder or abortion? Woah
What's harder, death or Mr. Carter?
Is it easier to play deaf or to listen harder?
I'm like, "Girl, what's harder than life for Mr. Carter?
Knock on wood, but with the wood comes termites and turmoil"

Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothing, keep resting,"
She say, "What's missing?"—"How you know something missing?"
He scratched his head, she say, "Get back in bed,"
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches

This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is

And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you"
She gave me a salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier!"
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"

You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh

In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow

Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me

But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)

Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress

There is no peace
I ride 'till is not wheels
Till there is no streets
Like where is my piece
They dying in them cells or already dead
Or tryna kill themselves
I rep my niggas, I love my city
I feel myself and she feel my wealth
So it will not help, I gotta get me
And money like pussy and I gotta get deep
So I gotta get street cause it's riding on me
My niggas can't drive, I got riders with me
And nah I ain't in to that back and forth chit chat
As a matter fact I'mma end that...
Prone to destruction, home is corrupting
Stones in my dungies won't do the justice
Them hundred dollar homes is in abundance
Hustle on a mountain, hustle in a tundra
Get that money or don't function
Punctuation exclamation exclamation period
That's the way I have to make it
S to K, you better take it, idiots period
Bull shit, I pity it
Them guns shot so loud you would think I MIDI'd it

Moolah, babe

She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame
She would do anything she could to feel the flame
When everybody know your move and the things you pay
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed

Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! (Yeah)
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
You know, this ain't paradise

He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame
And he would do anything he could to kill the pain
When everybody know your moves, they speak of your name
And, oh, all over the late night local news, I heard him scream

Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! (Yeah)
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!

Blisters on my knees, from beggin' for forgiveness
Ain't no dollars on my trees, but mileage on my feet
'Cause I been climbin' to the peak, and runnin' from the bullshit

Dead Presidents, bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat
Starin' at big poster, I swear that he be winkin' back
Cut school, sell crack, sorry, I'm just thinkin' back

Nigga I'm young as a muhfucka

Young Money muthafucka, get it in blood puddles
Shit, I'm in the south where we living in mud puddles
Shit is a drug struggle when you niggas upping prices
I hug the Glock like a turn buckle
Can't get stop by the vices, no license
Rolling like dices on the streets
Where the odds is high
Where the crime is life
And the life is time, and the time is jail
And in the jail you stressin
The judge probably hit me with an algebraic expression
But I get away free like Ocean's Eleven
And I motion the metal, like a pro-fe-ssional
And when I'm rolling especially, like a pimp suppose to
Watch how you sit down somethings in that sofa
If she with me, you know that something's in that ho bra
She's a foreigner so she say coca
I get broke off and they get brok-er
They like so what, i'm like so when?
We going know then how the turn in turn out
Cause we going shoot back till the burners burn out
Till the burning burn down every house the block hold
I'm hollering at you niggas with every shot the Glock hold
You can't see me there's a thousand blind folds
And my mind state is put a thousand on top of those
Chea, I do school and do lunch at Pappadeaux's
They want beef I turn that to that to sloppy joes
Copy cats brrrrrrat, copy those
Had a strong relationship with expensive clothes
This stuntin shit is extensive and intense
Like pulling up in something Americans can't invent
Chea, I make them fall back, they gotta indent
Like a paragraph, the first sentence, shit
I'm way smarter man, I'm more gifted
Straight from the womb to pro, prolific
I'm so, I'm so so, I'm so lifted
High in the sky, me and pops taking pictures
That’s my vision, until my vision is vivid

Lyin' there, lookin' like "Aww, yeah", lawn chair
Jumped right off the Con-Air and landed on a timeshare
I wear Versace eyewear, feelin' like top shelf
Cool as two Ls and Rock Bells, hot as Scottsdale
Bombshell, ugh
Blackin' out, blackin' out
We on the drugs, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out
All the guns, black it out, black it out, black-black-black it out
On the run, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, yo
Bow! Yeah, blackin' out, blackin' out
We on the drugs, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out

Ahem
I'd like for you to take this time
And remember where you was
The first time you heard Dedication
If I asked you how many times you've listened to D2
Could you tell me?
Dedication 3 was the first mixtape you heard when we had a Black president
D4 and 5, we got back to business
Y'all done copied the rhymes
Y'all done stole the artwork
Tried to emulate my shit-talkin'
Weezy and Dram' — we are the Mixtape Blueprint
Hahaha! You welcome
A Dedication

I got Doja, Narcotics, and Actavis; that's DNA
Got a Dyke-ho, Nympho, And your bitch layin' next to me and bae
Eazy like NWA, they make me feel A-OK
Feeling like Tony, "Grr-rr-reat!"; feeling all on me, TSA
She got Dollars, Nut, and Alcohol all over her T&A

Let's enjoy some NBA, y'all lil boys NCAA
Yeah we got A-M-M-O, but you'll get beat like MMA
I got Dracos, Ninos, Automatics; that's my DNA
You'll get beat like Sugar Ray, TKO, O-H-H

I got moonrock, molly, ecstasy, inside this weed, it's laced
I smoke doobies, don't smoke J's
Don't watch movies, don't go to plays
I watch cuties, porn, and play
I got Uzis on the way
I don't be choosey, I don't be safe
I don't get woozy, I get the waist
My bitch ballin' like Zhané, Erykah Badu with the fade
Capital-WNBA, I just teach her how to save
I been sleepin' with my AK, with my finger around her waist
I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA
That's the land of the Free, it's the home of AJ
Got a whole brick of some yay, I put one line on the plate
She's gon' take it to the face, like "thin line between love and hate"
I got Dealers 'N' Associates, call that my DNA
All these diamonds, all this gold and shit, call that PB&J
I got Bloods in LA, I got Bloods down in the A
I got Bloods everywhere you lay but ain't no blood in my filet
Hit the court, shoot the DA, treat beef like USDA
OMW to your trap, (Blap!), now I'll be On My Way
I got plugs I ain't got to pay, I got shit I ain't got to say
I got cribs way out of state, I ain't got no more pocket space
Sippin' slo-mo at my pace, lean like I wear a brace
Queens want to be embraced, Kings want to be an Ace
I remember Ace of Spades, I remember the Goose is Grey
Now it's Bumbu by the case, nigga, fuck you, fly away
Six shit, (blrrrp)

Alone in a mansion, I'm Macaulay Culkin
Thought about your coffin and started barfin'
Thought about your orphans, how they probably starvin'
Thought about this artful shit, how I'm so thoughtful
Walkin' on the marble, feelin' like Ricardo
Walkin' 'round like the campus of Harvard
Shoutout my nigga Swizz, niggas gettin' smarter
Try to hit the books, and nigga hit the target
Sittin' on the charter, talkin' 'bout the targets
Waitin' on departure, waitin' on a sculpture
Make sure my vultures keep an extra cartridge
And make sure my Barbies keep an extra Barbie
My dick is her electric chair, feel the voltage
And her pussy better smell like a orchid
Wetter than a wishin' well, need a quarter

Dedication 6, and every day we sick
Treatin' medication scrips like some Revelation scripts
I thought yesterday we quit
But you know, every day we spent
Then we celebrate the win like we'll never play again
Lord I just talked to my hitman, he say that he made a list
Nigga always breakin' in, and he never leave a print
And I never shaved a brick, OK, now I'm talkin' shit
Where that bakin' soda mix? Raise my Arm & Hammer fist
And my yellowbone, she thick, and her belly don't exist
And she never saw the gym, she stay healthy 'cause she strip
Doin' very late events, and I never paid a cent
Pussy never leave a scent, Toni Braxton, breathe again
Every day, all week, we lit, you know every day we sip
And we having steak and shrimp with some naked waitresses
Told that bitch to bring a friend, you know that we make 'em kiss
She know if it's goin' down, I keep a elevator lit
Now where the elevator music? Yeah, they better play the hits
I can serenade a bitch, you interrogate a bitch
If we interrogate that bitch, we be like "Where that safe at, bitch?"
Put that barrel to her tits, and if she hesitate, that's it
I need that combination bitch, 'cause I ain't got no patience bitch
I hate to do it, but the line between love and hate is thin
You know every day we win, you know second place ain't shit
You know that we take the kids, just like Freddy, Jason, IT
You know that we spray and dip, one-eight-seven, eighty-six
While you eatin' bacon grits again while police takin' tips
You know every day we drip, drippin' wet Mercedes-Benz
Drippin' wet and glazy clit, you know every day she drenched

We takin' on all names, it ain't no more games
I'm a stand up nigga, Cory Kaepernick bitch
I don't know what to call you
Niggas claimin' they loyal to the soil
But boy I'm loyal to the oil that boil
To court with the all you
You cannot avoid it when I'm gonna destroy you
Work from the ceiling to make sure that I fall you
I'm dedicated to this rhyme shit
S double, the militia gang, they don't ever try them bitch
I got a nine and click, a high been brick
A bottom bitch, I buy them thick
Drivin' stick, life's a bitch, and I give dick
I ride the five, my partner crip
Shout out the East, we parkin' shit
I just revive, I don't remix
I don't remind, until C5 we got D6, nigga
The best things in life are free, not cheap, free C5
Message, no reply
Rest In Peace, no peace sign
I keep an eye on these guys
My third eye give her sweet eyes
The bird eye's view keep spy
But I can get your wings deep fried
Try, try again, keep tryin'
All the traffic hours, you a taxi driver, we some maximizers
Ever heard of San Francisco 49'ers, we some masterminders
Made it to the top just to get sniped from the floor at the very bottom
Ain't that a bitch, man tell me about it
But I ain't trippin', unless the trip is private
I sip in silence
I tried to make it beautiful, and this shit came out perfect
Let the guns speak for they self, I ain't never been a loud person
Walkin' 'round the house in the turban
These niggas washed up with no detergent
Take your heart and I am not a surgeon
Pullin' triggers like shower curtains
Ain't got no soul because my baby sucked it out of me
Me and my whoas in Las Vegas playing the thot machines
Stick to my goals, expectations like a soccer team
Waiting to exhale only to let out some steam
Girl let's make a movie, what's a movie without a shower scene?
Treat my semi like an Emmy, need some nominees
Taught me how to count before they taught me how to read
I knew all my OG's before my ABC's
Damn
That's some sick shit

Well, tonight I found my price to the spender
And she cried about our life to the listener
And she asked me for advice, so I pimped her
Turn that chicken head to a chicken tender
In a Wraith, in a Wraith, out of state license plates
I got yay an AK and a temper
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Don't know how I'm drivin' straight
I sipped a lake of that grape, thirst quencher, oh
Girl, fuck with him and get your money
You fuck with me, you missin' money, then you miss your molly
I get the money, spend the money, then I miss the money
But it come right back, right back, right back
That's that Frisbee money
That's Santa climbin' down the chimney, money with the duffy
It come back, run around the gang, yeah that's some dizzy money
The Humpty Dumpty, she get on that dick, she's very comfy
I put a Rolie on her wrist, she used to wear a scrunchy
Party times, Tunechi wise
Wifey's size, truly lies
Booty, thighs, bougie pride
Gucci slides, moody, tired
Woozy, high, movie night
Jacuzzi time, ooo-ee, ahh
Dinner, prime; sushi, wine
And for dessert I have the cutie-pie
Lied about the price to the spender
And I lied about my height on Tinder
And if I hit it one time I won't remember
But can't forget it if she bring another member
Double date, double date
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Bitch, I'm eatin' full plate like November
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
In a different mind state
Let her sniff some snowflakes and call her Winter (yah)
Fuck with him and get the money
Then come fuck with me and split the money
I'll fuck her when she with her buddy
She guzzle dick and kiss her buddy
She said I love you when he send some money
I said I love you give your pimp some money
And she don't ask how much she just come dump it
And I don't ask how high I just start jumpin'
You ain't know I kiss below the button, what
Girl close your eyes and let me show you somethin', what
And if you ride me like the road is bumpin', what
I leave my key in and the motor runnin', what
Oh my god I hope they kissin' cousins
If they not it's gon' be consequences, repercussions
Woah, I just count a hundred thousand hundreds
And I told my babe ride the wave, Cowabunga
Lied about her night to her nigga
Her vagina 'bout to cry me a river
If she ask me for advice and I igged her
But she know it wasn't me, it was the sizzurp
Gotta wait, gotta wait
'Til I wake, 'til I wake
I wake up and tell bae how much I missed her
She looks straight in my face then start pointin' to the space
Where she want it on her face, she's particular

We had sex 'til nine, ate breakfast tired
Fell asleep eye to eye, thigh on thigh

If you mesmerized be mesmerized
If you scared of love, I'm death-defyin'
Got to make your mind, I'ma make the guap
Got to take your time, I'ma take the shot

Then rape your thot, then shake the spot
I'ma shake your hand when I see you out

Keep that shit in your shitter
Or eat that shit, don't spit up, rrr!
Keep my bad bitch did up
Keep my main bitch put up
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, damn
Your thot need to get her look up, ugh
You're plottin' on me, my foot up, ugh
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion, ugh
That ain't sauce, that's pudding, ugh
Tunechi 'cross her bosom, damn
Shooting up the jurors, damn
Don't name my pistol
I named the trigger "Benjamin Button"
Push him, bam!
Y'all just pussy, get buried together and let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullies
Gon' pull up in hoodies and come take a look-see
Better play hooky, I got some hookers hookin' up with politicans
And some athletes, and some college niggas
Send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest nigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' hockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a lick and
When the shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Mickey
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly-wiggly
Fuck my bitches' friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch is giving me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, J.C. Penney's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winning, win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to business, and we laugh at sentencing
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artist or a starving artist
In the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeerers
Now your good luck looking like you cracking mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And the cash, it triple; flip, kick, jiujitsu
Throwing pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than The Simpsons
And her man a simper, so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec, I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!
Yeah, cannibalism, going animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave your la familia behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got their eyes wide, but too blind to see it
With friends like those, it make me text all my enemies
And tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walking 'round my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talking out their bowel movers
Turn their homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo you
Tell a doc that's tryna save your life and running wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it
We put out the movie, win awards
She got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostituting
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
En route to Houston with the contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the coupe, ho, and I know that you know
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you out of the loop though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
The power to do so, my pockets is sumo
Getting the mula by the minuto
Mafia Nouveau, I am the uno
Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Fuck with me, I go Lollapaloo-zo
Pull up, trigger finger, holler, and pull-o
Pow-pow-pow, sound like a symphony
Or opera, two-door, hitting some new notes
And I am the maestro, and you just a typo
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow

Looking in the mirror, all I see is money

He said his bitch flushed the work, time to do some plumbin'
Gotta love the way we comin' though, we keep it comin'

Pledge allegiance to the region that's beneath and under

If I'm too deep then get a bigger shovel, dig a tunnel
If you a beast then that bitch can't get a nickel from you
I'm the only one that speak when we in the huddle
Make a pussy nigga leak, then jump in the puddle
We comin' deep to your street, 'bout to rent a shuttle
Every day of the week, if I hit the streets, I gotta hit a hustle
Every day of the week I gotta get loaded—Lordy, skip the bufferin'!
I got it made, and with that said, I gotta tip the butler
I like my bitches mustard, business hushed, and Bentleys custom
Bitches sufferin' 'cause the system fucked 'em, now they fuckin'
They can't hide their battle scars but they can hide their stomachs
Niggas like Niagara Falls how their mouths are runnin'
But we making caviar out of flounders, guppies
Stand tall, but I'm a munchkin to my pile of money
Got down and dug it, found a nugget, made a mountain of it
Don't need a crown, gown, or nothing; I'm the king of subject
Chocolate, brown, cream, and fudgie, and I'm peanut buttery
Fuck the fuckery, I go skullduggery, it get ugly

Mind your business 'fore I shut your fuckin' business down
She say my lyrics like a lifeline when she down
She checkin' bitches off my timeline when she down
But all them bitches on the sideline, out of bounds
Watchin' us play around

Stephanie and Weezy now
The birds birds birds are you singing now?
Little Cuban little Puerto-rican now
A lil' souvenir gotta get me now
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Tarzan on your bitch you are just Plain Jane
I just laugh at the shit with my bad bitch gang (gang gang)
Cause' you ain't a bad bitch without a YM chain
You might also like
I second that shit you ain't lyin' that's game
I tell your nigga meet me outside in the rain
I shoot him up like a hundred times then again
Again and again, are you not entertained?
Ain't no better drugs than the ones I know
I done went down on bitches I don't know
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
And right now I'm both, got me talking bout you hoe

Said she really love the blonde look
So she dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula
And I'm screaming
Fuck your team, fuck your team, fuck your team, Like 2Pac
Sip slow, no blowin' highs, no killin' vibes
We touch each other, touch the skies, she rub her eyes
She cry Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula
She cry Money Team, Money Team, Money Team
Then I zoom out

I said "Tell me who you loyal to?"
Is it Weezy? Is it Wayne? Is it Tunechi? Is it gang?
Or these no-names hanging with a nigga with a name?
How you poppin' pain pills and you living with the pain?
You can't tell me that ain't horrible
And my love always free when the lights get dark
I know love isn't cheap I got a nice-ass job
You look priceless to me, I'll rip your price tag off
Baby "Tell me who you loyal to?"
Do you start with the money or the man?
Does it end with your heart in your hand?
Fuck it, if the money bag in the other hand, that was the plan
Let that nigga spoil you
I guess somebody else on grind mode
But a nigga that provide though
Put his pride to the side though, and you my slime, so
Said she really love the blonde look
So she dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
I'm 'bout to put my hands on her like E. Honda
Cause' she walkin' around in a Young Money tee without a bottom
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, zoom out
Nigga you could throw up peace, I'm throwin' squad up
Had to get the dreads bleached, the James Blonde look
She saw my pic on IG, now she's inspired
She dyed her shit we look like Weezy and Madonna
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's some sick shit! Money Team

See, this Dedication mixtape series is so important to the culture because they say it is. It's plain and simple, plain and simple. I don't label it important to the culture. If I have ever labelled it important to the culture I was feelin' myself and smellin' my drawers -- uh, pause -- I'm old, my mama used to always say that, my grandma used to say that "You smellin' your drawers." -- but anyway, I don't know if y'all people say that, I'm from the south -- but yeah, the Dedication mixtape series is important to the culture because the culture say it's important. So that's why I still jump my ass in these motherfuckin' booths, wherever I can find a booth, most likely the same one, and do my motherfuckin' thing. And I gotta keep doing my thing and that's why I do my thing because the culture say it's important. They say "We want that, we need that, we gotta have that." It make the-it make the world know what I mean? It make the music world spin, and that's what it's all about, and it's 'cause they say it6Embed
A YMGM Collaboration
Young Money, Generation M
Get with it!

Squad poppin' like the Pentagon
Squad poppin' like the renaissance
Squad poppin' like the Thriller song
And you pussy ass niggas thrill is gone
My squad lit like a strobe light
Squad lit on a slow night
Squad ain't got no type
Cinderella, Pocahontas, Snow White
My squad poppin', my bitch shoppin'
My niggas thuggin', my bitch robbin'
I'm inside cuddlin' with the chopper
Workin' on the stove, like a novel
Diggin' in my pockets, tryna find the bottom
Codeine got the drink all soggy
And your queen got my dick hard body
There's a stick up in my drawers, armed robbery
My squad poppin' like the white house
Squad never need time out
Squad way up on the ninth cloud
Way up here we got iCloud
My squad lit like a strobe light
Every night, any night, all night
6 hoes and they all dykes
And all they need is one mic
My new attic full of dead bodies
Old attic full of dead bodies
Bedroom full of red bodies
I got your main bitch headlinin'
She cry to me, said "You're no fair"
Cried to me, said "You're low fare"
Dry pussy with no hair
So we showered together and the soap fell
Then I ask her how the dope feel
I don't care how the ho feel
I kick her ass out the dope house
And she can ask her ass how the door feel
Squad pop like the Pentagon
Thot talk like Jenny Jones
Smokin' loud like an intercom
I'ma keep it summer all winter long
Squad lit like the sunlight
You gon' have to squint or use one eye
No Mike Tyson, this a gun fight
Had to hide my guns 'cause they gun-shy
Squad pop like the Pentagon
Had to put a few killers on
If you don't want no static
You gon' have to put some antennas on
Wait, drop-top with the titties on
Bitch bounce like a tennis ball
Pussies hatin' like menopause
Its a jungle out there, Senegal
Wait, drop-top with the tinteds on
It get ugly when I'm pretty stoned
Fat pockets with the skinnies on
I'm dead right, but I'm livin' wrong
No red lights, my limits gone
My meds right, I'm Trippy Jones
My wave right like Billabong
My diamonds dance like Diddy Combs
Her headlights, I turn 'em on
She wanna go to Mars, that journey long
I'm gon' fuck her hard 'til her sternum gone
My diamonds sing, she learn the songs
I woke up, like this ho
I'm burnin' pot like Crisco
She a Crip ho but she a nympho
And we color blind, and you know love is blind
In each other's eyes, we butterflies
Rock and roll like Hummer tires
I don't even got to be her number 1
I'm her number 6 and she my number 9
Get it?
All these drugs scientific
All these boys science fiction
Softer than a flying ribbon
Walkin' all 9 innings
Talkin' shit while I'm shittin'
Defecation expensive
Destination exquisite
Dedication 6th senses
I'm the shit up in the restroom
Guess who up in my guest room
Smack her ass, leave a flesh wound
Weezy F. Baby, test tube
The Martian get high as Neptunes
I fuck your bitch, how is that news?
And you ain't shit to a raccoon
I go ape-shit on these baboons
The diamonds still doin' dance moves
The money still makin' fast moves
6 feet or 3 pair of shoes
You still underground where the grass grew
Headshot, that's a hairdo
Blood drop like shampoo
Young Vidal Sassoon
Oh well, no Shamu
She clap her ass and the lamp blew
We catch your ass gettin' fast food
It happen fast, then we vamoose
Rat-a-tat-ta-ta-tat, poof

Hold on, bad hoes need to get a raise, lame niggas tryna get away
But all ya diamonds need to get appraised, you in the way
Too many nights I was out lurking, mind in a daze, nowadays

Sipping Minute Maid, gotta penetrate, let me demonstrate
Got the Jones soda with the drink in it
Got a backwood with the dank in it
Party ain't popping if we ain't in it
Go Blake Griffin, might flex on 'em
That's too much sauce, I bet them hoes know who I are
They treat a nigga like a superstar and that's what I am
I got your bitch but that's my bitch
So that's our bitch and that's all cool
When you trip out, wan' dip out, she just call me and I fall through
And that's bad news, hold these nuts, cashews
Vroom, I flew past you, new whips here, what the bags do
Past cool, young Jones

They wrap the body, then rap about it
Sink the body, then sing about it, zip the body, then sip about it
Fuck the world, I'ma still get some cool things up out it
If a CEO wanna dance all in my videos, I need a big deposit

I ain't focused there, Gotham City, got Batmans and Jokers there
I'm in the club but I'm in the cut
They got cameras here like Oprah's here
Since a kid, I heard gunshots, mothers cry, all the shit soldiers hear
So I had to "abracadabra," "voila," just to make hope appear
Young!

Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Told momma, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out

Magic dust, yeah that's a rush
Got her cracking up, crying all at once, man, that was fun
I'm spazzing up, I'm gassing up that Cali stuff, that massacre
I'm magical with chemicals and smashing stuff, Metallica
Satanical like Skeletor, you greener than a salad bar
I leave from here to Africa to read some Maya Angelou
Impractical, you acting all DiCaprio; we trap and go for casserole
We back and forth in traffic with that Macklemore
That magic snow, it's always cold and my freak on that molly water
I met this bitch on Collins but she out the hood, her mama cook
I'm on the way, I'm on a stage, the Magic show, I feel like Dave
I walk on water, float in air, I'm over there, I'm in your face
I pop up out of nowhere, bop-bop at your doorbell
Disappear in thin air, all we leave is smoke there
Smoking roadkill, she on coke here
Stash is sticking to her nosehair
I'm a magician in the motel, moving tricks for wholesale
Hold on, abracadabra, the data don't matter
We rata-ta-ta-ta over the chatter, we got mo ammo than grammar
Hammers and hammers, pull up in Lambos
Shoot up the cameras, die in pajamas
Find you with Sam and your wife and your mamas
All in your family, I'm balling like Magic, voila!

Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real

What haven't I done yet?
I haven't Bungee jumped, err, haven't been to Mount Everest, err, take that back, I've probably have been to Mount Everest. Probably flown over it, probably rolled past it and it just was twisted, you nah mean?  That's real shit, real shit, real shit. Holla at my friends, they will let you know slime has sat down and probably ate with the president, and whatever president it was at the time, totally don't remember, you nah mean? But I do remember, Obama saying my name in a speech, shoutout Obama. But still, what haven't I done yet....release Carter V3Embed
I keep the blammer in the drawer with the pajamas
I keep the ammo in the bananas
I keep the standards high as the Canyon
I treat the Grammy's like some medallions
I treat the randoms like some companions
I treat the weed like some azaleas
I got more value than I got failure
I got more flings than I got flair
I don't dream if I do not have nothing to wear
You see what I mean, and that's why you stare
I know you believe, I know you beware
I know she a fiend, and this an affair
If momma a queen, and poppa a bear
You run out of steam, you run out of stairs
I run in Supreme and get something rare
She run to the team, and now she a player
We live on the edge, we die in the air
We sick in the head, but pockets is well
We tiptoe on eggs, we out of our shell
Our vision is red, the eyes are as well
We can't pay attention, we got to pay bills
It doesn't make sense if it's not making mills
We do not take pictures, we're not taking L's
If y'all love to listen, then I hate to tell
If y'all scared to visit, then I take it there
If heaven is real, then y'all fake as hell
Cut off your heels and bounce on your tail
I'm on a mission, survival is real
Man, fuck how I fix it, admire the repairs
I'm talking six but my mind is on twelve
Poppin' prescriptions on top of the hill
Even the devil advised me to chill
I told that nigga, stay out of my hair
She just want to fuck in the throne
Shit get too deep and they dug up your bones
I'm sippin' that Sleep and I'm smoking that Gone
When you reach your peak, we gon' cut off your arms
She sniffin' that King and she mix it with Kong
Her clit got a ring, and my dick got a horn
This is what I call a risk and reward
We cutting it close, give the ninja the sword
Fuck what they think, man these niggas don't know us
This shit is sick and it get in your pores
And then you a corpse, and then it's the morgue
Me, I'ma hustle until it's the Forbes
I swore, it was no more than a chore
The house by the water, condo by the shore
I'm sure, I'm all about that manure
Cooler than leather and hot as velour
I'm not the one, when it is war
I'm on the front until combat is done
And I got your tongue, stomp on it once
Then smile at your young, they see I'm having fun
Shit don't get brazy 'til I say go brazy
Run up on your haven and pop at your nasal
Your baby gon' take me straight down to the basement
Gun to the head, she get down to the basics
No dramatization, we popping these gauges
Even the neighbors gon' feel the vibrations
Behind desperation, it's just in our nature
So cold-hearted, perspiration turn to glaciers
Ovations, better be loud and bodacious
And then I'ma take me a bow and be gracious
Wipe the gun off with my towel
Throw it in the crowd and then take a pow at the spacious
I'm out of my mazes, I'm out of my cages
I'm out of the labels, I'm kind of escapist
I profit, I praise it, I spend it, I save it
I buy me a nation, you renting on Avis
I'm in it, I sit it, I did it, you said it
You killing, you playing, I'm friendly, I'm faded
I get way too high to get through the hiatus
You look in my eyes and my pupils dilated
I'm true to my ratings, I'm glued to my statements
I just want to dive in the pool of my payments
I'm in and outrageous, I'm rippin' out pages
You runnin' your mouth, seein' how quick you can chase it
And then you rephrase it, we stick to invasions
The stick is malicious, equipped with a laser
The temperature blazin', the tension is raisin'
You smell the dead once, gotta live with the fragrance
Sickness is real, the meds is too tasty
Death is related, happy we made it
Keeping it dirty like Sanford and Grady
The Young Mula Baby, I'm back from the 80s
Dedication, sick, shit

The craziest place I've ever seen a Lil Wayne tattoo on someone is... you ready? So, I'm 'bout to explain it, um... inside the lips of their pussy. Um, that's just the craziest place. So like, even when you see the pussy, she can show any man her pussy, he won't see it. She has to literally open her pussy up for you to see the name. Shout out- shout my homegirl, that's my homegirl, one time for her. I love you, girl. What's the craziest place I haven't seen a Lil Wayne tattoo is when people come up to me and say "You know I got your name on me, but, like, I can't show you right now 'cause I'm in work," or, "I can't show you right now 'cause," whatever. You ain't got my fuckin' name on you, shut the fuck up1Embed

You woke up and then you tried to live the dream
Well before you check yourself, check my history

If it heaven sent right now, she gon' give a nigga hell later
If you don't get the shit right now
You gon' love to hate the smell later
I tell her hold up, your pictures don't entice me
She told me pull up, and then she heard a light screech, yeah
I woke up with a white bitch under white sheets
She got a black heart, telling white lies through her white teeth
Black eyes from always tryna fight sleep
Ran into your wifey, she say, "Tunechi, wife me"
Hello, I'm so spicy, I got her sweating like Keith
Though our time brief, she be on me like briefs

My friendship with Mack Maine is far, far, far, far, far, far more than a friendship. That's my fuckin' brother. I've known Mack since the hood, Hollygrove. He had the biggest house in the hood, it was right on the corner. I'm not sure if the whole house was theirs but it was huge, and he had a big ol' basketball court on his backyard and everybody used to play ba-, ball in his backyard. And umm, since he lived on the corner, like, you can always go and chill and play basketball on his backyard and then, like, always be right there on the corner in case some shit pop off. So yeah, me and Mack been down since the hood. He went to a good school, I didn't go to a too good school but then we ended up goin' to the same school, the school is actually called Mack Maine, know what I mean, and then, umm, he got known for fuckin' over niggas freestylin'. You know I mean, you know, Mack is cold at ribbin', I don't know if y'all call that roastin' or what all that shit y'all call it, but uh, he cold at that, period. He could tear your ass up, make you cry, make you wan' kill him. That type of shit. He one of them nigga, you know what it is? Still be laughing overtime and actually have you laughing but still mad, that's one of them niggas. So yes, when you know how to do that don't Lord don't let you know how to rhyme and he knew how to rhyme, so he used to kill niggas on that shit so that's how we really jammed up with the music shit. Shout out my nigga Mack2Embed

Hood boss, what's up?
6, 6, 6 (Gangsta Grizz-ills!)

Big body on brabus, that's all I know
Big shotties in the closet, that's all I wore
Screaming "money over power," quote, un-quote
And if the bread get too low, kidnap John Doe (Hold up)

I just fucked your bitch in some Young Money flip flops
I'm smoking on that loud and you can hear a pin drop (Hold up)
I just kissed my bitch and I left codeine in her mouth (Yeah)
Swimming in my money, I smell chlorine when I count (Get 'em)

Skating and mating, I'm spinning like Daytons
I'm winning like Peyton, I'm Christian like Laettner
I'm putting some straightener into all of these Satans
I'm wilder than Nathan, Goliath on David
I'm quietly waiting, I'm trying to be patient
But they want me to wait for Simon to say it
But I am too faded, so talk to my agent
Or they talk about you to your congregation
Man, no conversation or negotiation
No affiliation by association
I need confirmation for my compensation
Or we make a corpse out of your corporation
I need my donation, take drugs in rotation
That AK gon' sound like a standing ovation
They landing your facial, bandanna, rosacea
I'm all about numbers, comparisons, ratios
Collateral, collateral
Xanax and Adderall got me unparalleled
Me and your bitch compatible
Go together like a parachute and a "geronimo"
This dick is mechanical
But he get too casual up in the vaginal
I pop a Viag-a-ra, she hop like a kangaroo
Suck like a snaggle-tooth
I ain't got time for no rumors
When I am not human, or you men, I'm booming
I'm fucking her, fucking her roomie
I'm platinum versus aluminum, I'm shrooming
I visualize what I'm assuming, my vision is gloomy
But fuck it, I zoom in and now I see movement
And I'd like to thank all the niggas that schooled me
But I still might shoot up my class reunion
I'm sipping that Houston like it's communion
Smoking some weed, bright as a petunia
I'm walking around Miss America
Like I'm the King, King of Zamunda
Been hanging around with my shooters
When you was still hanging out with Mr. Cooper
Which one of you niggas want beef?
I'm putting your name all inside the chalupa
Money since the Mayans, thuggin' since the riots
Six, exemplifyin', higher than Orion
Lion off the diet, eat the whole safari
Pop a cork or body, keep it soft and sour
Watch the market tower
Find a wooden counter, knock on it twice and count 'em
Competition, clown 'em, opposition chowder
Watch the bitches shower, optimistic mama
Common sense ain't common, top position scholar
So far from the bottom, they can't hear me holler
All I say is our, all I say is our, our father
My lil' bae a model, pussy taste like cobbler
Make me "As-salamu alaykum" about her
What more can I say about her? Pray about it
I just race the 'Rari, left it way behind me, taste the mileage
Loud-ass blatant diamonds, I think they the loudest
Waking zombies
Break a face or promise, give me steak lasagna, hate your honor
Still my mama's baby; and my baby mamas, they some riders
Can't deflate them tires, I'm still chasing commas
Nigga, I made Big Tymers
And I'm still taking time to make it timeless
Dedication problems
Six shit, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah...

The nicest thing a fan can say to me when they approach me on the street is any fucking thing true, anything real. You know what I mean, that's the nicest thing. I mean like, even if its cliché, cliché I can still tell when that cliché was straight from your heart and that's all you could think about, all you could think to say when you saw me or if you meant it, like even if it's that, like I said just when it's real. You know why? 'Cause sometimes people can say things that's so real to them that they don't even know that, you know what I mean, some of the things they are saying isn't fact, you know what I mean, official. But you know, things like so what I mean like example: you might walk up on somebody, I might walk up on somebody on the street and they might, uh, they might... shout out the valet from today, umm well yesterday, shout out the valet from yesterday, before you opened the door of my car, you're looking in my eyes, you're a young cat too, you look me in the eyes and you say ahh, and he couldn't, his English wasn't all that, he said: I like the new album, I really like the new project, and I said to him I was like thank you man, he meant that, 'cause he looked me in my eyes and he even opened my door before he said it, you know what I mean, so I was like damn you know when I got in the car I was like damn it's not a project. You know what I mean I don't even consider that, it's damn sure not an album just a mixtape, you know what I mean, but to him that was real, that shit was real, could be a project not an album, so shout out to homie.

Umm to help these multiple generations that look at me as the reason they started rapping or the reason why they rap and into music is ... uh ... it's unexplainable. There isn't a word for it. You can't describe the feeling. Um if there, you know what I mean, there's words that's probably close to it, and when I say close I mean light years away from it, words like amazing, awesome, that's probably the closest, and like I said, that's light years away from the feeling, you know what I mean. I can't explain it, it's crazy just to turn on the television, just to see my own children walk inside and be like, you know what I mean, singing something you know like what is you talking about right now, what are you singing, what are you listening to on that iPad, what are you watching? And they be like "such and such" and I be like, you know, what is that, and they be like, you know what I mean, "he loves you Daddy, he loves you Daddy, he always shouting you out Daddy, he always..." and that's when they put me on, you know what I mean.

All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night we can't recall it
She lay down and close her eyes, fall asleep open hearted
She done died and went to heaven, I forgot to close the coffin
I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the sorrow
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promise to be loyal
So I promise to be faithful, but I'm prolly not gon' chase you
Sit down on my dinner table, eat that pussy like it's catered
I just tell my main ting "Since you my main ting
You can turn your phone off and let your name ring
You can scratch yo' goals off and you can thank me
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"
I just told my main thing "Since you my main thing
Let them have the fame thing 'cause it's the same thing
You can take them clothes off and let that thang breathe
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"

I just poured a whole deuce inside a 16
Yeah she reppin' two countries, yeah she mixed breed
Got her smokin' rapper weed, tryna spit Vs
She been goin' 30 minutes, she just switched knees
Uh, pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary
Pimpin' ain't dead, check the cemetery
If I tell you that I love you, I ain't lying girl
So worry 'bout yourself and not the other bitch I'm tellin'

All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night was all recorded
Every day she catchin' feelings, every night I throw a party
That's that "Fire and Desire", I forgot to throw her water
I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the horror
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promise that she loyal
So I promise to be faithful
Yeah, Lil Weezy; F for faithful, funky, freaky, freshly flavored
Flawless, fleek, finesse, finagle and fatal2Embed

My swag is in order, nigga, image is a must
Six digits on the car, nigga, that's a plus
Six hundred for the jeans, I never pull my pants up
Already there, why you tryna get your grams up
I put your hoe in handcuffs, I take her hostage
I see you walkin round, short arms, deep pockets
I live to see a profit, you down to break even
I'm really in the clear, you niggas stay leakin
You niggas just ain't eatin
Pick another lane
Rap game, crack game, you should pick another game
I'm headed for the jeweler, bout to pick another chain
Then I go to the pad, bout to stick another dame

I rock, I roll
I'm fly, I know
You broke, you mad
Turn your swag, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up

See I'm a rock and roll all-star, a hip hop legend
I eat the track up, now where is my beverage
I belch bars, excuse my presents
And I charge for every letter, like a fuckin text message
Chrome on, shades on, game on
And my V-Neck is pushed like Mason
You can't fuck with me, man
You're like Weak Man to me, man
What up, blood

What up, gangsta
Belt game banging, chain game slanging
Weezy F Baby, the shit still stankin

My doe don't fold, my cash don't bend
My doors go up, my sounds up loud
You are nothing, but another face in the crowd
Corner store John Doe, lookin for a name
The shit you provide me, is nothing to the game
I'm the leader of the pack, you can tell by the talk
I'm a bonified star, you can tell by the walk
One hand on my nuts, the other on a stack
You lookin for doe, I can show you where it's at

I rock, I roll

You broke, you mad
Turn your swag, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it upEmbed

Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Jeezy, Juvie, Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg

Age is nothing but some digits, nigga trust me on this
Cause I think I speak for everyone when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L in the C L, gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every whip cause haters likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catching rights to her lip behind diapers and shit
But I like me a spliff drink henny without the ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinking I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm able to handle my situations correctly
And I know I might be young but nigga gone definitely respect me
But in the mean while I'm fighting gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like I'm never happy now
Except for the fact my daughter saying I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up, but I smoke bout 3 blunts
And puff a cooler boost me up

And when you feel like everything is going wrong man

I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm fed up thinking everything's a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff, just trust me it's tough
But I maintain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when things get awful
And I'm often on the edge stuck without a solution
Someway I still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and just doubt me
Cause y'all cats don't really know me, y'all just know about me
But my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't never say I thought they ain't appreciate what I do
But just know if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through, but I be like

Who would have known that this was someday turn out so hectic?
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
And I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully changed
I'm always street so I'll forever be facing a change
And I'll keep the slang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm wasting a man
And if I want it, then I get, and if I need it, I have it
Take care of them family first, plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And ever so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leading my path
And I ain't ask for you to like me, I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me, no other man can never make me or break me
Now I be faithfully inspired by the hood til I'm gone
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown so I'll be good on my own, but I be like

We are at war with the universe

And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da, da, da, da-da-da, da, da, da

But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometime that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn

I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now

These friends, they come and go

Weezy F
Young Money, Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3, ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go

You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me, "Don't get high" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it; if she steal it, I'ma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital — Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like C-Y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil' intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See, my world is different, like Dwayne Wayne

And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free"
And I hate when a nigga say, "Talk is cheap"
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me, yeah
My flow is art — unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is "Eat"
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40-cal. tucked in my P-R-Ps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand-new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours
And I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa — that's fucked up, haha
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
Haha, now that's fucked up
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit, but I cannot forget the streets

Rub my back, ask how my day go

Say no mo', cause she go low, bless my woe-woe
I say "uh-oh," she start slow-mo
Once that coco start her mojo

Once that dope go, she go bozo

Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga

Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz

I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

I never change, you know I been this bitch

"Let it all work out, let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out, let it all work out"

Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, "I'm sorry for even apologizing"
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet
Yeah, and he said
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
(I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
Let it all work out (Phew)
"Let it all work out"
(But he said, "Remember this:")
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
("Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch")
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
("And don't forget what I did this, bitch")
"Let it all work out"
("Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch")
"Let it all—"
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)

People point at me, say, "Oh my God"

Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet

Message to my lawyer: "Don't let me make these bitches famous"
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard

Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, "Am I dreamin'?"
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, "Can you look this way? Can you look this way?"

Traphouse doorbell ringin'
Traphouse gettin' too famous
His traphouse poppin' all night
The porch light should be strobe lights
That shit them police don't like
You know them pigs no good like pork rinds
Gotta go home to that whore wife
That don't never wan' fuck, just start fights
And he just made a hard right at the wrong time
They pulled him over, if they only write him a ticket, he'll be alright
Yeah, right
‘Cause you know he fit the description of a black male that sell white
AK on the backseat
Trunk full of cocaína
He stepped on the gas and got ghost on 'em
His bitch scream like she seen one
He said, “Shut up while I speed up”
She said, “I think you lost 'em," now he think he lost 'em
Now he lost his train of thought
The voice in his head said, “All aboard”
And he woke up, don't listen to that bitch
She coked up off of his stuff
And he know it's good
Where the popcorn? This story good, call Hollywood
But anyway, let a nigga get back to it
He came to a neighborhood and he zig-zagged through it
He didn't see the lights, but he still heard the sirens
Cut off all his lights and they drove right by him, woo
Chapter two
Traphouse just got cable
Stuntin' on the neighbors

One hit Willy
Other nigga live with a milli
Other nigga ride him Phillies
Run through the hood, all blood, blowin' bills on grils
Just chillin' up in New York City
One got witty
Took his mask off, he a dumbass
Got him on viddy
Somebody yelled out, “Yo, that's 'Chelle”
Blaow, blaow, caught her in the titty, huh
Four more shells went to his face like gazelles
Bloody, they laced him up well
Niggas stop shootin', get the loot
Stop bullshittin', boy, you wild, stop playin' yourself
This ain't good, now they fucked
Police barricade the buildin', what?
Now we stuck
Now this clown-ass nigga just fucked us all up (Up)
Eleven more shots

Chain popped off, caught him in his top
Fell to the floor, damn four-year-old shorty just looked up
Said, “They got you”
Damn, another nigga dead
Another nigga head licked, damn, they copped out
What's it all about, kid?
Max out, shed, play the background, we's out

Got too much on my mind, hit the blunt and reflect
When I was under arrest, my bitch was under duress
I bet she fucked while I was gone, then I doubled the bet
I smoke weed in Amsterdam and I smuggle the rest
I act like I'm shakin' your hand and you'll get punched with the left
And you can get killed for shit you said under your breath
And if you do choose to bark, it ain't nothin' to a vet
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Yo bitch about to swallow a bunch of me's, nigga
I got a white girl fuckin', suckin' me, nigga
While I'm thinkin' 'bout the days that it sucked to be niggas

Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
Nigga, keep your head up like that gun to ya neck
And my bitch was scared to fly 'til we fucked on a jet
Fucked her in the cockpit, all these buttons to press

I just got myself a blonde with the puffiest chest
I just bought myself some time, wrote my Rollie a check
Ridin' in a double R, just regrettin' regret
Getting loaded more than once, no Russian Roulette
I just left King of Diamonds, I just fucked a baguette
I ain't called her since that day, I just wasn't impressed
Bull with a nose ring, startin' a bunch of BS
Hide the gun, knock on your door, dressed like UPS
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas

I said, "I gotta do what I gotta
Is you gon' ride with me or you not?"
And she start cryin' and said, "I'm not"

So they can't follow me on my jet"
I tell my pilot where to go next
I bring that problem to your doorstep
I catch you slippin' while you tired

I'm Tunechi, hi, I'm here to collect
They wondering why I ain't gettin' no rest
'Cause that's just too close to arrestin'
And too far from "serve and protect"
So, Police, read me my wrongs, or just leave me alone
Rubbing, squinting my eyes, I still don't see where I'm wrong
Sold my soul to the streets, they bought it previously-owned
Went to jail for a Glock and soon as I got home
I went and bought myself a 9 and that new MAC-11
You talk shit at 10:59 and make the news at 11
Bitch, I'm the wildest motherfucker on a team full of rebels
Young, wild motherfucker to a MILF, cougar, leopard

I'm a lion, motherfucker, to these hoes 'cause you can sweat a little
Euro my secret weapon like Mark, Jackson and Stephen
I see plain-clothes pigs and unmarked intrepids
My bitch believe what I say, I told her salt was pepper
I'm cold as malts and metals, sell stolen parts, whatever
Put three holes in your head like a bowling ball, don't spare 'em
And all my niggas in jail, that's bullshit, I smell ya
Remember Destiny's Child? My favorite one was Farrah, man

Bought myself a 9 and my brother a TEC
I know you don't want war like you just a cadet
Tell a motherfucker who next, "Motherfucker, you next"
I'm the best rapper alive and they love me to death, bye

"Oh, believe that," and then the drinks came
And then the mood changed and then her answer switched
She let her hair down and lit a cancer stick
She saw it turned me off and said she tryna quit
She went to the ladies room and I hopped on my phone
Most likely she doin' the same thing

Like, "Girl, what you think?
Um, should I do it?"
She say, "Shit, I don't know

Fuck, why did I do it?
Bitch, I bet that nigga knew he was gon' fuck
From 'Hi, how you doin'?"
And then her friend on the phone say
"Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga
Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga" (Yeah)
And then she said, "Yes, I did, and I fucked him good
So I hope he tell his girl that I fucked him good"4Embed

Don't cry (Oh), don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads, "Don’t cry, stay tuned"
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry, don't cry)

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll (Let 'em drop and roll)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry)

Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise141Embed
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
I used to walk a thin line, now I'm walking chin high
I used to fuck and get tired, now I fuck her ten times
She used to make me dick rise, now she make me ribeyes
She used to make me six-nine, now she make her friend try
She used to make me love her, now she make me realize
It's money over bitches 'till the day I dizz-ie
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies

Find out where he reside and find out where he hide
Run up in that bitch like, "Hey," pop-pop-pop, peace sign
Percocet, promethazine, you can call me P-Rod
Taking shots at my team, you must be getting senile
You goin' at my slime then you're going at me, slime
Your blood all over the scene, it look like red cheap wine
I'm smoking on a key lime, you look like tea time
Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose
Run up in a nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
Safe code now nigga, cough it up or spit it out
Oh my God I'm flipping out, flipping out then dipping out

My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy

Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee

As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you

Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror,, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced

Couple a cracks in the mirror
Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died

You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say, now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few

'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A

Ah-em

Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, "You're a son of a gun"
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, "I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, "Nothing's easy"
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, "Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious"
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout "What about how she feel?"
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
"Baby where my keys at?"
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back

Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas, see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
She agree to my demands too
Brought the demon out her ass too

Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I’m dope, nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em—it's that "Carter V," let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin’ every winter
And as long as I’m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I’m not a broke nigga

I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin’, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs

Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system

All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho

Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga—get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin', and my needle broke

'Til you motherfuckers come for me, yah (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Don't worry if me got a gun
You should have a gun for me, yah
And all these niggas is killers (Killers with you)
And all these killers with me, yeah (Gangsta!)
But you should be afraid of me (Gangsta!)
'Cause I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
Yeah, I'ma kill 'em, yes, I'ma kill 'em
And I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
I'ma kill 'em

They say powder makes you hyper, reefer makes you calm
Cigarettes give you cancer, woo-woos make you dull
While I sip the purple harlot, thick as my Southern drawl
Put me on the ocean floor with a mermaid with no drawers
They got bats up in the cave, upside-down
Blood rushing to they head, they reacting off sound
As I stand on the mound, pitching for the crown
Uptown-bound, face painted like a clown
Reciting scriptures from the chapters, Proverbs, Leviticus
Old-ass rappers complaining what the business is
'Bout the state of hip, sounding like some bitches
Hop your ass up off a rich nigga dick, it's ridiculous
The new school, nigga
What you need to do is become a resident under conditions
Get your ass up off your ass, and get your ass up on a mission
Become some competition, like Federer and Nadal
Young Money, nigga, we ball, like Kobe or Chris Paul
Forgiving a wack cracker, still sipping Cristal
Waving the lifeline, since life's a bitch, y'all
Raising up the skirts of Jezebels for no cash
Like, "Bitch, gimme that ass"
Or pulling up to the lot, like, "Gimme that Jag'"
No, pulling up to the lot, like, "Gimme that Lam'"
They study me, yeah, they cram, like I'm a final exam
If I hit you in your back, you'll need a spinal exam
I'm something like a rhino or ram: animal, beast
Irritating you pussies like chlamydia, yeast
YM militia, you niggas better retreat
Or be like this beat: R.I.P., deceased
'Cause I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
Yeah, I'ma kill 'em, yes, I'm kill 'em
And I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
I'ma kill 'em (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)

Yeah, already, you better call every pallbear-ier in y'all area
The ball carrier gon' get popped
If I'm coming around the block, the ensuing drive gets stopped
He gon' drop like a flop
On the court, I love sports, that's why I play my bitches
'Cause I got game; that's why you pay my bitches, yeah
Same hustle, new money
I'm just hip-hopping like two bunnies (Gangsta!)
Who run it? Bitch nigga, moi
That was French, nigga, not a kiss, nigga, nah
Ha, no homo
Rappers get ate like four on four
They say I fucked so-and-so
And I be like "So, so and so"
Nikes on they neck, they like, "Let me breathe"
"I'm sorry, but I can't—this is how we feed" (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
This is why we hot, this is how we freeze
Too fast to follow, this is why we lead
And the money in our pockets isn't why we G's, see
This is how we shoot, and this is how we leave (Gangsta!)
You know we tote steel, this is how we is
You can get the steel if you try these thieves
Now, pass me the Swisher, let me climb these trees
And them haters say we couldn't; this is why we be's
The shit like pudding
Putting it down, like gravity's pulling
Putting it down, like gravity's pulling
Putting it down, like gravity's pulling me
To the ground (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)

You may need to shorten the lean after that
Man, I swear I drunk so much of lean, I almost passed
Not tryna say I've been clean after that
But let's just say that is a thing of the past
But can you picture the scene after that?
No more Lil Tunechi, no more king of rap
Life can be gone in a blink of an eye
Lord, I guess I just be blinkin' too fast

Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas

Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas

And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night

I'm all about that cheese, swiss or mozzarella
Muenster, Colby, American, or cheddar
When it come to robbery, nobody do it better
Notorious L.A.D., fresh Coogi sweater (Gangsta Gri-Zillz! Yeah)
The cleanest, lyrics is the meanest
Understand my English, nigga, I'm a genius
Ice like a snow cone, writing in my iPhone
Went from selling crack to selling ringtones
Straight out the projects to million-dollar homes
Inside The Carter, cooking 36 zones
Thirty-six O's, and I break 'em all down
In and out of every trap, all through the A-Town (Ill!)
The Embassy, AMG, Young Money merger
I'm a young champ Like Ben Roethlisberger (AMG!)
S.S. Chevy with the big block engine
Rims and paint cost me a whole pension, pow! (Gangsta!)

I don't need nothing but my niggas and enough weed to go around
A tinted sedan, some grams, and a loaded pound
Fuck what another nigga think of me
I'm thinking multimillions, he thinkin' Gs (Oh!)
Nigga, please—get your mind right
Fuck tryna be fresh—get your grind right
'Cause I'm like, so in another league
I throw my pitches at different degrees
And I spiral my pigskins at different speeds
And I hit threes, 'cause at different times, I release
My shot cold, nigga, I'm hot, don't be tight 'cause you not
Just be happy I'm letting you breathe
I'm the good, I'm the bad, I'm the devil, I'm Jesus
It's Young Money, bitch, the game needs us
Gudda Gudda, what it is nigga?
Kidd Kidd and Sean, get it how you live, nigga
My nigga Mack Maine just left the dealership
And Weezy just ripped the drop Phantom, so they feelin' sick
Diamond rings, diamond chains, royal suites
Private planes, palm trees, big change, I can't complain
I made a promise to myself that I'd never be a have-not
Nigga, fuck being broke, shit
Before that day come, I'll A-K stamp you
When there's beef, I'm in the center like Tyson Chandler
Fuck what you heard, in the booth, I goes off like the lights if you ain't pay and it's the third

Still 'bout my money, nigga, fuck another man

I be climbing through your window like I'm fucking Bruh Man

A bankroll of bucks is what these young niggas killing for
The game dirty on the streets, tryna deal yayo
Fifty clips at his hat, leave a peeled potato

I call my nina "bay," like San Diego
Get me twisted, and I'ma turn into a tornado
And all my riders riding like a Winnebago
You stay, but I'ma let that A-K go
Rawer than a 'qualone
Shoot you like "Halo," give your ass a halo
These bitches walk around acting like they J-Lo
But man, I remember when these bitches was just "Hey, ho" (Gangsta!)
"Hey ho, how you doing?" Me, I'm doing every fucking thing
Smokin' them dykes, I'm on that Mary-fucking-Jane (Gangsta!)
This shit so "Tom and Jerry" to Lil Wayne
And you MCs are just "milk and cherries" to Lil Wayne
Haha! And bitch, I'm greedy
But if I keep eatin' you rappers, I'll get sugar-diabetes
Sweetie, I'm a different species
I'll crush your two fingers into a million pieces
What the fuck do I be thinking?
"Kill, kill, murder, and Benjamin Franklin"
Your girlfriend is into them gangstas
And me—being a gangsta, I get into your girlfriend (Gangsta!)
I stay still when the world spins
And ain't nobody flyer than the Birdman
You heard me? You heard him? "Him" being me

I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended
Pause, like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters: I’m a shooting star

Young Money, CMR, Blood like a scar
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" ain't for "Flaw"

It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point

These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track: train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the "F" is for "Fuck yourself"

Uhh, yeah
And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there

Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda

I just won a war in a Hummer 'fore I'm 'bout to come to yours
Lookin' for a war, I am nothin' more than somethin' more
Than much more as the punch pour
And I slunch more with my lungs sore
I smoke you and your blunt blowers
Let's get on with it, Megatron with it
Telephone like a telethon
Bitches workin' bitches like a Peloton
Finish yellow bones dizzy, very long visits
And I'm talkin' numbers, Jerry Jones digits
I'm at home sippin', and I'm gone sippin'
Got a Draco with my arm in it
Shoot you in your heart, put some charm in it
Sorry, gotta leave your mama tormented
"Bah, bah, bah" if she commented
Cops pulled up, and they vomited
I am not finished, hope they long-winded
Money long-livin' with a strong finish
Dead presidents, wasn't born with it, I'ma die with it
I'm amor with it, didn't start livin' 'til the war ended

I'm a pimp under pressure, but it's necessary
Treat a bad fish better than a veterinary
Never treat a secondary sweet as February
I could turn a bestie into a adversary
I tried, no, really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I, I, got a lot on my mind
To my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind," oh no
That's why I just get high
I light one and watch time go by, go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
Is it love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried

Thought I was done tryna love
I guess I love tryna love, hey
Not so careful, but today, I just don't care
Dye my hair
We so faded, we can't make it up my stairs
We fuck right there
Not so lucky, but tonight, I just crapped out
Vegas sucks, I'm still gambling with her, no protection
Protect what?
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows?
Nigga, not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least

Bitch, I be spraying Macks
All type of guns with accessories
I'm like Cosby for the bills
I need mills like Stephanie
Pussy niggas can't stand next to me
I've got dope and ecstasy
Keep em floating like both of the levees breached
Eighties baby but my soul from the seventies
Worldwide game like a traveled the seven seas
Niggas ain't OG, scary lil bitch, please
Put your pussy in the pan, Friskies

I got ten up on my pinky ring and twenty on my bracelet
Now these niggas kissing ass, but they can't say shit
I'm just here to separate
The real from the fake shit
I told you, I was coming in
I'm sorry for the wait
I gotta get this money man
It's right here in my face
I got the Devil on my back
I don't wanna be up in that place
My grandmom tell me to be safe
I just keep running in these streets
I can't stop fucking with these hoes
When I say I'm just doing me
Bitch, I'm a Ninth Ward nigga
Mason street, D & G
That Florida right by the D
Need to free my nigga B
I ain't the type of person to be
Running from no beef, those fucking guns
Are gonna be bursting, knock somebody
Off their feet
So watch your fucking mouth
Before you end up on that floor and stop
Acting like you're hard cause
You know you've been a ho
I told you out the gate I'm not the fake
I gotta say, please excuse
Almost forgot man, I'm Raw Dizzy by the way
Money over bitches, bitch I'm coming for the check
Vampire living, bitch I'm coming for your neck
Raw, I'm sharp, my swagger like an X
I'm a motherfucking monster, I rap like I'm possessed
Call me Mr. Still Smoking, smoke it in a paper
The game is a bitch, hold that down and rape her
Yes I am a Blood but I be riding with my skaters
We probably smoking flavors bumping Tyler, the Creator
I'm an Eastside native, all my niggas Soo Woop'n
They went brazy when they heard I had a song with Lil Tunechi
Bitch, get some ice and pour my Sprite
And light my bong and my doobies
Fuck your producer, I'm the one who be
Producing my music
I'm a hippie surrounded by a lot of pot
Cock the semi
Drop you like an Otterbox
They sleeping on me like I'm rapping with a blanket
Kill a nigga, have him thinking that he planking

All-red plaid shirt, skinny ass jeans on
Them goons at your front door, choppers out: "ding dong"
Didn't I change the game and put my motherfucking team on
Now let my chopper ring, blaka is my ringtone
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes
We hold court with them heaters, pop case open/closed
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed Oreos
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic's clothes
Ask them bitches, I told em hoes
They back it up like Sonny drive in Bronx Tale, Calogero
Lighter in my pocket, light the sky rocket
Pull them hammers out and run them nigga's like stockings
Got some niggas from my city
Thugga, Dizzy, Flow

If you're scared, go to church and get a scripture tat
Guns the size of children; now, don't be childish
Be with wild-ass niggas, and I am the wildest
I'm a motherfucker; call me Weezy, baby
And on the end of the barrel, I got a sweet potato
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady

Kush in the Swisher, money over bitches
Never kill a woman, unless she a witness
All about my business, survival of the fittest
She let me hide my weed in her titties
Bitch, I got the cash, in a rubberband
I got the Glock, already cocked, boom!
Fucking with a nigga, meet my motherfucking goons
Sorry 4 the Wait, Carter IV coming soon
Light it up, cause I’ma smoker
She tried to deepthroat, I fucked around and choked her
It’s Young Money, motherfucker, game over
Shots leave your body, looking like you doing yoga
And Lord knows I'm a sinner, pain pills for dinner
Bitch, I'm getting money like I got a money printer
Got a chopper and a trimmer, shooting like Jimmer
You coming in that water, boy, you better be a swimmer
I ain't worrying bout y’all, sitting on my Hog
While Miss Anita Baker sing "You Bringing Me Joy"
I came straight outta jail and did my thing on these boys
And we all yelled, “Fuck you, bitch!” and kept going
I'm on, and that’s right, baby
I ain't going out this bitch without a fight, baby
One request: please don’t bite, baby
I got some bomb-ass pussy from a white lady
I ain't lying, I’ma shine like a nickel or a diamond
I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind
Girl, stop talking that shit
Go on and suck a nigga dick for a new outfit, hahaha
And even if the sky come falling
Bitch, I’ma still be high
I got faith in my weedman
My lil niggas got yay' by the beanbag
Hit your ass from the side like a screen pass

Ain’t nobody fuckin' with me
First-degree murder, you can get your degree, motherfucker
And you ain’t gotta wonder about me, Wonder Woman
Tune gon' ball, money tall, Paul Bunyan
Real nigga shit, pussy niggas gon' hate
Pound of the kush, call that bitch "pound cake"
I hit it from the back and make that bitch about-face
And then I gotta split, sorry, baby, sour grapes
She whine, "Baby, don't leave"
I duck that bullshit, bob and weave
Everybody trippin', but I ain’t never trippin'
Leave your ass flatter than my new television
I'm talkin' 'bout money and the power, power and the money
This shit is magic: Stan Van Gundy
I'ma run this shit 'til I'm the last man runnin'
Mack, light that shit, then pass that to me
Young Money, motherfucker, yeah, we that shit
Yeah, Weezy go hard like Cialis
Don't love that bitch, I fucked that ho
She pop X; I smoke O’s—tic-tac-toe
And I stink, 'cause I got a lot of shit on my mind
They say numbers don't lie—is that a 6 or a 9?
I stand in front of the clock, 'cause I'm ahead of the time
Knock your pussy ass off and send your head to your mom
I ain’t playin' with niggas, no, sir, not me
And they can’t blindfold what my third eye see
Yeah, I was locked up, but like a bird, I'm free
And the coupe transform, no Tyrese
Hello, goodbye, where are you, Wayne?
I’m somewhere in between joy and pain
And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground
Now, ain’t that 'bout a bitch? It ain’t never 'bout a bitch
I'll take your bitch and make her everybody bitch
Backed up by a bunch of G-ass niggas
And I just bought your girlfriend some kneepads, nigga
Ha, Eagle Street, where the real niggas hung
I'ma rep that shit 'til kingdom come
Yeah, $hort bring the drank, I bring the blunts
Fuckin' with me, it's blood, brains or guts, argh!
Fuck y'all, for real, though
Sleep with the hammer under the pillow
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I’m done, peel off like velcro
Gone, baby, I'm stoned
Smokin' on the strong, got a huge-ass bong
Swag off the hook, you can’t use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on
Haha, one time for the G’s
The niggas got it locked, the niggas with the keys
The niggas on the block, the niggas on they P’s and Q’s
Put your bitch-ass on the evenin' news
Jumpin' in the game, better read the rules
High as a bitch, yeah, that's me on the moon
Fuck with me, die soon, not late

Standing outside up in the blizzard and walking hot handed

Tch— I should call her
When I call her, I’ma be like— I’ma be like, “Ayy—“

Or should I call her “beautiful,” or— (Gangsta— Gangsta—)
Something nice, you know?
That’s sweet

Should I just be like, “Bitch!” Like— (Gangsta— Gangsta—)
How ‘bout “Miss?” “Miss!”
“Miss!” Okay— (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

Ms. Butter Pecan, caramel, Southern belle
She hotter than a summer day in Hell
I'm under her spell; she say her name was Chantel
She say she got a man—I can't tell
Because when we be rockin', we get it poppin like a Amstel
Like, right up in the hotel—maybe the stairwell
She blows kisses to my handheld
She's an angel—her name should be "Angel"
I'm blessed, I kill her with the rich man smell
She got a wet manhole, and your mans fell, whoa!
I slipped in her inkwell
I saw jellyfish and seashells—no further details
I love the smell of a female
And you're one hell of a female
I'm tellin' you, female: Get in the CL
And let it be sweet sailin' and late night emailin'

Neighbors keep trippin', we keep fuckin'
Sex revolution; baby, I'm comin'—
Down the hallway that lead to your stomach, mami

Yeah, rapping is my hobby, my house has a lobby
My bitches act snobby, because I feed them thousands
I know that didn't rhyme but I'm only being honest
You can't pay me in cash now I'm only seeing commas
I swear I got on Saks Fifth boxers right now
I'm tryna milk the game as if the game was a cow
I had an Eddie Bauer Expedition seven years ago
My grandma used to tell me that she swear I been here before
I used to wear braids like Jason's Lyric, whoa
Spent a bundle on the cross because I'm spiritual
And I can never pass a physical, I stay high
High as the voice of Akon
And make mine a straight with no chase
Hold the ice, I got enough on anyway
And when they see the boy, they hyperventilate

Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft, and bring the whammys back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami, though

And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me

Well, not just us—a couple foreign sluts
Yeah, we could make this a ménage à trois-ing, darling
I be with Jim Jones, and we be balling—balling?

Pint of DJ Screw and that Hawaiian, I am—
Leaning like a three-legged lion, climbing—
Right to the top of the motherfucking mountain, counting
I'm gonna need me and a accountant to count it
Mannie got this fucking beat pounding—it's pounding
But it was just lost until I found it—I found it
Stole it like a scoundrel, Hollygrove hound it
Put this bitch to sleep—fucking right—I nightgowned it
Niggas talkin cheap; tell them niggas, "Pipe down, bitch!"
Bloods in the building, and now, everybody soundless
Beating up this track like a motherfucking round-fist
Blind, deaf, or crazy, I'ma spit, like a long kiss

And when I go she'll miss it

I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time
You've got one night only

Back the hell off!
Rock and roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherfuckers somethin' to feel on
Rollin' like a motherfucker, put your wheels on
And let's roll down the hill 'til the hill gone
I started on the block but that's somethin, to build on
And how can I pray when I got nuttin' to kneel on?

Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now, but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down, but the ground is gone
Don't look down 'cause the ground is gone
Right now, I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

Huh, walk on air
Show me to the edge and I walk off there
We ain't high enough, au contraire
And sometimes life just don't compare
Sa-Say my name, baby, pull my hair
And I'ma fuck you like a bull, I swear
I got a lot of love that I could just share
I got a lot of drugs that I could just share
I-I-I know, I know what you like, girl
A nice little mirror and a little white girl
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing
May I be everything but grounded
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float...

Rollin up stepping outta the phantom's ass
Put cha litters away ur talking to a can of gas
There's nothing to say no matter who comes to ask
And murder ain't funny but we do love to laugh
Shit we just living take money take baths
Take a nigga bitch and fuck her
And send her back wit nothing
Now isn't that disgusting
Give him back his sista give him back his cousin
Yea, go make a stack or something
Go and buy yourself a spine and give back the frontin'
Yea and to end that discussion

The government try to put us in a muzzle
But you're two fingers ain't the pieces to da puzzle
Shit say to each his own hustle
And I hustle all night and then go home to the fussin'
Then wake up to the fuckin'
Breakfast in bed don't forget my english muffin
Hawaiin punch tastes like robitussin
A nigga jus livin jus breathin jus puffin'
Come on mama drop down and curl up
Dick millimeter cock back and murda
Aye senorita we cannot go any further
If my girl catch us both in the spot she will merk us
Pussy niggas talkin all that slop we will merk cause
Hungry ass niggas I tote two hamburgers

Young money cash money dump confetti on da winner
And yet he understood us so when we told em' break it off
Cause gangstas don't' talk one word'll be a war
And yo platoon can't handle the destruction
Hard body baby killin' sound like seduction

Man, fuck them bitches and them hoes
And them niggas pussies, camel toes
I got some money on me, and the weed nice
My shit won’t ever stop, suck my green light
Bitch it’s Carter 4, murder's all she wrote
Now it’s fuck everybody, like a Scorpio
Still running shit, I’m on my cardio
Boy I’m going in, like my water broke
Suicide note, suicide doors
I put in overtime, like a tied score
Tinted windows bitch, that mean mind yours
And the weed loud, like a lion's roar
Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever
Hear no evil see no evil, Helen Keller
No music on, rock it acapella
And I don’t need a watch, the time is now or never
Tell my niggas love, I die behind this shit
A nigga counting money, you niggas counterfeit
Real nigga nigga, proud of what I am
Young Money is an army, bitch I’m Uncle Sam
Them hoes call me Tunechi, mama call me Tune
I left the bullshit in the waiting room
Straight to the money, no short cuts
Now watch me go retarded, yellow short bus
We do drive-bys, we do walk-ups
And bitch I be so high, I get starstruck
Millz in this bitch, he said fuck them hoes
And the jewelry bright, like summer clothes
And I keep some bud, like Rudy Huxtable
I’m bout to slam the beat, nigga Dusty Rhodes
I’m from eagle street, I go Hercules
I get on the beat, murder 1st degree
YMCMB, we don’t give a fuck
You faker than some titties, you get tittie fucked

Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix, man, just gon' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand with no easy fix, man (damn)
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar and hoes in the crib
Drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with P.A. so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
Said we do it for the Pimp so no holding back, let's go!
Look who crept in, crept-crept in
Look-look who crept in, look-look who
L-l-l-look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB 'til the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants
Like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seem
To get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper
Now it's Chandon, fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight
That my crown ain't for testing, testing
Chop heads off like King Henry the Eighth
Guillotine to your neck, bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wildin' dude
Studied Taoism and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet, seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
But yo, my nigga Wayne

Flatbush to Bed Do-or-Die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company, and Weezy the boss!

They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Hm... Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth
Got 'em sayin' "There he goes again!"
See now, they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistaking
How I be breakin' up everything
And be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (Damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door

God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up, like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight

But if I run into her, believe me, I will— hold on
Your bitch love me—we don't even have to meet

And if that bitch is crazy, believe me, I will sue her
Got some hungry-ass lawyers that will eat her up and chew her
I don't know how you love her; I wish I never knew her
She only gave me brain—she was just another tutor
She blew my whole band—I was just another tuba
Now get off my dick, and get lost in Aruba

Well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me
Keepin' my two fingers crossed, but I'm still lookin' for peace
I been lookin' at the clouds, maybe they'll listen to me
Can't talk dirty to myself because the mirror's too clean
Tryin' never to look back because the light always green
It's safe to say I lost my way, but I never lost the lead

And if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

Every time it beat, it break apart
I really think it's all my daddy fault
I can't find the keys to my heart
Think I'ma need the automatic start
Out there lookin' for love after dark
Then I get tired and it's an afterthought
Where's the love? Five question marks
Eat your heart out, I had to starve
It's the saddest part
I'm questionin' myself, I ain't gotta answer yours
Baby, that's for sure
I take a look at myself and then I just pass the torch
Baby, back and forth
I ask can we get together just to break back apart
Baby, that's the cure
Me, myself, I, my iPhone, Fantastic Four
Never knew 'take it or leave it' could be so literal
Never knew takin' a breather could be so physical
Never knew takin' it easy could be so difficult
Never knew takin' these drugs could be so spiritual
Never knew the chemist like how I know the chemicals
Never knew takin' a life could be so minuscule
Never know takin' chances will be individual
Never know takin' advantage would be inhospitable, how pivotal
Never knew the shit I never knew would be minimal, how cynical
Never knew love and hate were similar, identical

I can't find the keys to this life
Picked the locks, I might be a'ight
Close my eyes, I might see the light
Life is a bitch, she might be my type
Death is a bitch, she might be tonight
Haters kiss and dick-eaters bite
Tables turn every day 'n night
Three-sixty, three-sixty-five
I can't find no leaks to my pipe
Police can't find nor reason nor right
Been tryna let shit happen on the fly
But I can't find a seat on that flight
There's a private plane, that's simple and plain
Tickets at a more reasonable price
Sometimes, I don't know how it's gon' end
Even though I done seen the movie twice
Pop a wheelie, new motorbike
Some people like to live a slower life
Some niggas like to live cutthroat
I'ma be the nigga that hold the knife
You girl wan' hold me tight over night
Who am I to tell her wrong from right?
I'ma give her more dick than advice
You give her more strings to a kite
I just found a needle in a haystack, bitch, it's payback
I found myself talkin' to myself with nothin' to say back
And I just found the keys to a Maybach I had way back
Tryna find everything but my way back
Yeah, well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
I been lookin' at my posse with a look of belief
I been lookin' my closet and it look like Paris
They been lookin' for your body, they been lookin' for weeks
They find you dead with your eyes open, lookin' for grief

I been lookin' at the clouds, they say they look up to me
Safe to say I lost some sleep, but I never lost my dreams
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep

If you not runnin' some top, we not gon' keep kickin' it
Classics, I keep scribblin', lights in the Universal building just keep flickerin'
Money just keep comin' in, you would think I'm Irish the way that it stays doublin'
I could feed a country with the tax that I pay governments
Whatеver they're doin' with my cash is vеry troublin'
Okay, February came around, I used to get paid shovelin'
Sold clothes, walked dogs, trust me, I stay hustlin'
When it came to school, there's no way that I'm A-plus-in' it
So I just dropped out of it, trust me, I'm not proud of it
Niggas get too comfy in they spot, they get knocked out of it
Niggas get a gun just so they can make props out of it
Shawty make a scene in the house, she get locked out of it
Yeah, you not 'bout to be chillin' in this bitch with kicked feet up

Pete O. used to throw a purple tint on a two-liter
First private plane I ever rode was a eight-seater

But now I'm givin' house tours 'til it's back to world tours
Play that "Mask Off" when they find the real cure
I might not be good for her, but I'm real to her
Got no time for her, but give Richard Mille to her
That's the only way I know how to express love
My dawgs love sticks and drums like they Questlove
All them jokes about Aubrey, they got me messed up, for real
I come with a lot of complications inside me
It's always people misleadin' me that are tryna guide me
Everyone wants to try me, but no one wants to buy me
Everyone wants to meet me, but no one wants to keep me
Everyone talkin' lemons when everything is peachy
Everyone got they hands out, and it ain't to reach me

She really, really into me, then suck it all up out of me
I'm proud of me, I don't know how to be sorry, apologies
You fuckin' with my math, you better know some trigonometry

When we fuck, man, that shit make her go faster

Got your wife on the edible, secret service
And she taking it down like the president
Can't survive in my element
If you never been in stride with the lions and elephants
When they free all my niggas then wherever Weezy be
Where I'm flying the felons in (Yup)
They be rhyming so predicate
Then, when you see 'em in person, they quiet and delicate
And 'til somebody die for the death of your brethren
I cannot buy what you selling in
We met at the Mandalay she live in San Jose
Visiting town with a friend today
When they hop in the Laundaulet
We 'bout to fuck over mandolins, champagne and creme brulée
Tell your little mans to stay in his place
Don't wanna get shot in your shin today
Nigga play on the internet, I don't get into that
I send a shot in your shin today
Way too many niggas and not enough bitches for all of this bitch shit
Too many to name, you know who to call
For real, some pimp shit
What you saying is not realistic
I just left Elliante the district
But I still go to Vice with the biscuit
Even still for a slice and I missed it
'Bout to gamble your life on a trip bitch
I be rolling the dice on on her lipstick
I'm a different type of sadistic
I don't look at the price when I get shit
I don't put in no ice when I sip shit
Lot of boomers and lights when I clip shit
Leave the room looking like I just flipped shit
She be riding me like I'm a ripstick
She say she want a body for Christmas
I'm living like some bucket list shit
If you don't like it suck a sick dick1Embed

Open face, Tunechi got shooters like Golden State
Shoot at a nigga, no dribble, no handle
Shoot at a nigga, no dribble, no travel
Shoot at a nigga, no Euro-step
Still have my dribble, ain't using my pivot yet

Shoot your coach up, shoot the sidelines
Court side seats, get blood on the popcorn
Shoot you like Jordan, like Bron-Bron
Shoot at a nigga like Harden from the outside
Nigga can't guard, can't block mine

Heater on call, it's a hotline
Shoot at a nigga, no double-dribble

Pull up with two hundred guns, it's a shootout
Shoot at a nigga, no hooping, no hoopla

I'm 'bout to spray at that nigga, no drizzle
Get down and lay down lil nigga, no pillow
I light up a J on a nigga, no Leno
I'm slime everyday on a nigga, no schedule
All of these lil' niggas claiming they killas

Pop me a seal, I pour a line and reseal it
Then I laugh at these niggas
Don't they look like my children?
Giggle, giggle, giggle, giggle
She lick it right after I bust—that shit tickle
She swallow a shot glass of nut like tequila
She like to talk when she fuck, I couldn't hear her

She wan' fuck on my rug, I say, "Bitch, that's chinchilla"
She like to masturbate while on her period
Then suck her finger, I swear she the weirdest
My trigger finger, that's all with my blood
Used to party with bloods, now Hollywood drugs
Got bitches on drugs in the car waiting for us
Waiting on there to fuck and then all day we fucking
And all night we bucking, all white, the cups in it
Cocaine is soft, all white deluxe
And his head might come off and you might see his guts
And it might make you barf and the memory blush
Run it, run it

And I might be on rush, yeah, I might be on slow
'Cause I might be on codeine and promethazine

No Ceilings 3, Lil Wayne

Go to war with your whole community
Go to war for these hoes, that's lunacy
I done lost all control of the goon in me
Chopper spark like it's electrocuting me
Pop a bar, sip some barre, smoke some Buddah weed
Pop it off, we can start the buffoonery
Only eat what I kill and watch who I eat
Normally pay for my meal, I'll kill you for free
No Ceilings 3

Tired of these strippers, I'm going at nurses
She write me prescriptions, she light up medicinal
The conditional critical, might need a physical
Cold as a hospital, warm and hospitable
Tommy gun extendo long as a tentacle
I got this octopus on me, it swim with you
I bring apocalypse straight to your living room
Tony the Tiger, you flaky, you cereal
My life a movie, get head underwater
We fuck in my pool, that's chlorine in her pussy
Codeine make the drank bubble like a jacuzzi
Codeine make it pink, something like a petunia
My baby whip faster than mine, she splurging
My baby sip glasses of wine, sip yurple
Take off that mask, bae, your smile don't deserve it
Take her to Belgium for waffles and syrup
Might take her to Paris to buy a few Birkins
They tryna put me in the can, she nervous
Bae Ima man I don’t mind I’ll serve it, just pray for your man pray your honor have mercy
She never leave me, she so down
She hang with actresses, don't even go out
I'm changing my status, I'm changing my profile
Changing my addy, I'm changing my doorknobs
I ran through the pack like it's inches on fourth down
Pour me some actavis, I watch it pour down
I drip every day just to stay in my own house
A nigga just trying to stay out the courthouse
Cullinan foggy, I'm smoking the loggy
I'm too high to argue, I'm too rich to bargain
That pussy my target, I look at my target
That pussy get soggy, her legs are wide open
Her tongue out like Jordan, cum on my Rick Owens
And cum on my Jordans and now I'm tiptoeing all up in her garden
And now her clit sore, I'ma rub on it for her
No Ceiling, nigga, hey
All of my hoes give facial, all of my hoes give fellatio
All of my hoes sensational, all of my hoes interracial
All of my hoes into gay shit, all of my hoes is persuasive
All of my hoes get a date, all of my hoes get 'em wasted
I be right there when you wake, and all of my hoes getting raises, Mula
She never leave me, she so down
I hang with capitalists, don't bring the broke 'round
This automatic a dummy a moron
I make it rain, clear it out like Boban
Run through the pack like inches on fourth down
Pour some actavis, I watch it pour down
I put on drip every day, it's a showdown
She blew my ceilings away, that's a blowjob

Messy lil' clit, wettеst lil’ throat, hold on, hold on real quick
We have sex on the beach, go where nobody knows, we got sand on our feet and white sand on our nose
Two nights ago, came in you twice and more, you say you'd like some more, I know you nice and slow
Ooh, you a angel, swallow the cum and say, "Thank you," I say, "De nada, mi amore"
She wants some Topanga, let me get my dreads out the way, I'm a casket, put the pussy dead in my face
She pull the dick out while I'm sleeping, I'm having wet dreams, she forgot her bikini
Ooh, now she topless, but like Champagne Papi, I start from the bottom, I'm the pussy monster
Might not love her, so when I fuck her, I put both hands on her neck and remind her

Love the way you walk, love the way you talk (Talk)
All the bands on me like a broke gettin' a boss
She'll suck a bag hard but the dick goes soft
She just choked on a dick but a nigga dozed off (Dozed off)
Michael Jackson, how the diamonds dancin'
I'm the boss, wake up, make her buy a phantom
Say he rich forever, so they really can't stand him
Tell her, "Suck the dick with two hands, I'm handsome"
When I pull up, take a bitch, ain't no ransom
He ain't dropped a hit, he ain't got no anthems (Woo)
It's a plain Patek, I won’t rock no ring
She just ran the money up, now they can't stand him
Might take a bitch to my momma spot (Momma spot)
She was a freaky, she licked me like lollipop
All this water on me, know that I keep a mop
All these cars, it's a G comin', flex a lot (No, Baby)

Knock on wood, it might answer back when you this real
Fuck your bitch, told her, "Hit me back whеn I clear here”
I could roll a blunt fastеr than your get your ears pierced

Never seen a bigger ticket than this, little bitty nigga
New Orleans, burry me up in the middle of it, nigga
I've been peepin', I've been squintin' and I still can't see a limit
Higher than my limitations, and the fuckin' Himalayas
And I'm stuntin on my neighbors
And the blunt as long as cables

That was our paper towels
Left my number for the waitress
She was flirtin', I embraced it
Now I'm fuckin' her and the women I was on a date with
I'm a god among Satans, I'm the doc that lost patience
I went from the judge sentence to a fuckin' fashion statement
Disappear like David Blaine when it come to affidavits
Aphrodisiac, all on your bitch face like aftershave

Wore a sweater for the ladies

Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me, don't believe me
I graduated from hungry and made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta, take it and eat it
But I'm gon' need cheese if I'm baking a ziti
You niggas want beef, I want a steak, and, uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be
Hardbody nigga just takin' it easy
All about my paper, 'bout my paper like E-Z
Wider wrappers, why do rappers lie to fans, lie to rappers?
Lot of rappers lie like actors, cut the motherfuckin' cameras
Cut the check, nigga, fuck your props
And make it out to "Mr. Hip-Hop"

I'm not dead, I'm alive24Embed

Then shoot my bitch
Behind orange juice and grits
Uzi clip
I need another Uzi clip
I shoot to kill
These pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real
Your head just a souvenir
She wanna get it off her chest
But her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter 5
On a iPod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said "Soon as these niggas hear your new shit
They gon' have to give they styles back"
I said "You too cray"
She said "You too humble"
I said "You too, bae"
She said "You too sweet"
Then I ask her do she go both ways
She say "They do say love is a two-way street"
I say "Oooh"
Talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine
She gon' wanna shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum
I'm gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt
Never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
Sell birds to the bees
I sell birds to the trees
"Tune, I heard you don't sleep"
I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk, but I tweak
For that purple, that pink
Yeah you see what I'm saying
Like you heard what you see
I'm a verbal disease
I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets
Since my curtains was sheets
Chef on these beats
I'm just stirring the grease
That bitch you in love with
She working for me
I personally
Get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers
I'm at peace
Word
I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart, street smart
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek
I'm absurd, I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money
Time served and released
But this agent ain't free
Word
That's the word on these streets
But that shit is old news
That shit's so yesterweek
I'm just focused
Focused on my expertise
They like "Tunechi, you good?"
I'm like "Bob, yessiree!"
Now don't, I mean don't
Don't question me
Let me breathe
Dog, big dog
I cock back and shoot at ya fleas
Money long – Tree trunk
Now stand under me
Catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees
But repeat what you heard
You a dead parakeet
It's Tunechi, bitch
Your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on my balcony
We watch the moon eclipse
We do unusual shit
She gonna need lube for this
'Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world
She like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events
Lord
I'll kill a nigga right now
I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than
These niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth
I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fuckin' self
"You only live twice, slime"
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate, like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline
But they never tried mine
Spittin' like I'm sippin' cyanide
While my bitch sip a Mai Tai
But she wine fine
And I'm so sorry
She say "Don't be sorry"
Woo
Then she say "Don't apologize for shit
'Cause you the shit
And we know Tha Carter 5 the shit"

I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in

Slow a bitch down like "Un momento"
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I'd rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk

So please study hard, study long

Young God in the building, 'bout to start a religion
'Bout to call Bin Laden up and order some missiles
Bring 'em straight to your block and go to war with you bitches
If you hit the head, then the rest fall in position
Shoot a nigga on his porch, and make him fall in his kitchen
Copped a big-boy Porsche with all the specifics
And I keep that torch, baby—call me "Olympics"
Red, white, blue pill, flip my skills like gymnasts
And never give a bitch money, blood, or kidneys
When the gun goes "Pow," I be at the finish
With my medal 'round my neck, autograph on my tennis
The land of the murder, dope, crack, and syringes
Pull up on you in the coupe—how fat is your engine?
Never talk to those that sat on the benches
Boy, I was in the game on fourth-and-inches
These niggas want the business, I'ma give these boys the business
See you fucking with the boy that tote toys before Christmas

She said don't worry son I'll help you make bond

Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eating carrot cake
So hard for me to put on a fake smile
I had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes
I don't do neither, it's at my bitch request
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck

And they respect me like a pistol, I'm hip to it
I gets to it, like, "Just do it," I miss doing it
Hundred-shot drum, play 'em some clip music
I am the drum major, the drum section waiting
All it takes is one signal: you can get a cadence
You can get it catered, I'm at your service like a waiter
When it's beef, I become a nigga neighbor (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
I put potatoes on the heater, no labor, later

To be honest, I don't think we gonna go to my truck cause her cousin's with her and she looking better than her
Yeah, she's fat in the ass, slim in the waist, kinda pretty and she down to take the shit in the face
Licking all on her lips, cause she love how I taste
It's dripping on her chin, hope it don't fall on my Bathing Apes

Handling streets in the Mandarin V
I hear you haters slandering me, I just hand 'em to P
Any drama, I pace it like Indiana
I take your grandma pacemaker and just hand her the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously pop two bangers
You do not want angus, USDA prime beef, you're dead meat

Got Mannie hot with me 'cause I always beat his beat up

Dollar holler at your boy on the avе
And that cheap perico is what I'm known to have

But I'm a designated hitter I adjust so fast
Ya'll men designing women, I'm a woman's man
I'm the Cash Money prince blow the trumpets band, and
They say they want the drugs to stop
But I'm a major set back when my album drop

Those vultures, them cops, and the lawyers out

She leaving messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey I'm ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name naw better yet point him out
Hey, me and the streets got a joint account
I'm from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans whoa they put the gat in your mouth
And we tote a lot of iron to flatten you out
Few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never tell on one another leave that in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packaging out

Got me looking down the ladder now when I climb
Pulling up on my nephews
And they don't wanna drive
They wanna learn how to work the tool
And who am I not to do the duty
Just think if pops advice get sent from black ink
And that stinks, but homie that's real
And in the hood even steaks smell bad on the grill
I remember when if you was a hustler you was a winner

That lean got me slow as Lisa Turtle—ask Screech, ugh
Bank card heavy, my wallet like a barbell
My girl got a fat cat: I call that shit "Garfield"
We'll bring the O.K. Corral to your doorbell
We pull triggers not coattails, I make lump sums: oatmeal
I'm stuntin', getting new money
Trukfit money, Mountain Dew money, tell 'em

In the words of my nigga BP, "I'll hit a bitch with a car bomb—boom!"
Lil' bitch

Niggas gonna bark I go Mike Vick
Fuckin' fuck niggas on that fuck shit
Suck a nigga dick for some Trukfit

Get your cake up, y'all niggas lame ducks
You probably get your game up when I'm givin' the game up
My name Wayne, what? Hot Boy, flame up
You niggas tryna change up and I'm gettin' my change up
I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power
I'm a D-boy, bitch, I'm a D-boy
Ho, I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the Rove' for the jackboys
I got money in my pocket, I got money on my block
I got the money and the power, I'm goneEmbed
Yeah
Drought 3
Hear my chains? Haha
That mean I'm balling, bitch!
Haha
If you didn't know
If you wasn't informed, or something like that
This is Da Drought 3
And um... Check this out

Yeah, imagine waking up out your sleep to them pistols blasting
And if the witness is dead, there's no trial
If you didn't know then, ho, well, you know now
And I don't mean basketball when I say, "I don't know y'all"
Money, money, money, money boost my morale
Play with my money, money, money: O.K. Corral
I like a bitch with a apple-bottom like Vokal
The top is at my fingertips like I ain't got no nails
I got blood brothers, bitch; I ain't got no pals
I make a girl get low, like I ain't got no L's
I'm a paper-chasing dog, check my toenails
And I never miss a game, no Shaq O'Neal
More like Brett Favre, just like Brett Favre
I been shot two times; just wipe that off
But I thank You for putting me right back, Lord
And to You, Father, I would give my life back for it
That knife, that sword; that gun, that war
Make your so-called "soldiers" just run like Gore
Yeah—Frank, that is, from San Francis'
And I got more banana clips than chimpanzees
Ten addresses, and I dresses
Like I thinks I'm the motherfucking best there is
And I'm about to bubble, and she catch that fizz
And I'm straight from Claiborne, nigga; just ask Liz
Check your neck—there ain't a crook like this
From the city where the judge throw the book at kids
Burner in school, in my bookbag, hid
Talk stupid at lunch, and we having your ribs
If you are not home, then we having your kids
And if you can't come up with half, I'll send you half of your kid
Back to the balling, extravagant crib
I'm on the toilet watching Martin, just laughing and shit
Don't know why I get high, but I get high
I get high, like, every single day
You do shit that them other women can't
Mary Jane, what is it you done to me? Yeah
I pop a beat and start rolling
And then, I smoke it like a muh'fucking stogie
Peep how I wrote it:
I was rappin to the "ding-ding-ding-ding..." Fuck it
You might also like
Get high, screw the world
And that's that, hahaha
I need all my funds, yeah
All my money, baby, haha
Black diamonds and pearls
Believe that, hm
I made "Bling Bling," and my chest look like a mural
I'm nuts—just call me "Squirrel"

My fetish is the girls
But the women—not the girls
Act your age, not your shoe size
Maybe we can do the twirl
I'll be the Prince of her pearl-tongue
Earring in her pearl-tongue
If she come, let her girl come
Give her a pill, give her girl one

"Party time, excellent"—yup, Wayne's World
Campbell's Soup on the wrist, just call me "Earl"
Lil' Marl, don't shoot 'em, you heard?
I get high, my words slur, I start callin 'em "Merl'"
"Hey, Merl', light that 'firre'"
And I know this old, but I'm really "Hot in Herre"
I went with the Phantom, my niggas copping the Spurs
My hand's in the pot—I'd rather eat and stir
It's I against the world
And I'm strapped! Yeah
I bring all my guns
Shoot mothers, fathers, babies—damn!
Black handguns to serve
We could see, but we are so blind to the signs
They trying to lose the world

And we will walk right up with our guns, yup
Hand in hand, yeah
We'll march right after the drum
But I don't mean no band

Nigga, Drought 3!5Embed
Yep, you guessed it
I came back
Ha, I came back around
Yeah, I came back
I came back, back, I came back around
Yeah!
So honored I am to have you back at the dinner table, feasters
Came back for seconds, people, yes!

Back door, back room, young nigga still switchin'
Young nigga still pitchin', naked bitches in the kitchen
Wishin' that I'd kiss em but I just missed em
Get my money, then I dismiss em
Lil' Marley still set trippin'
He got a bigger pistol now
He say he ain't missin'—you can't miss him
He's the skinny dude with da dreads, high yellow-red
That's always my blood, so we forever bled
You ain't got to go upstairs, you know what's up there
Bitches and cookware, hell yeah, fuck yeah
You know you smell dat cocaine, tough air
It's been a long time comin', but I come up fair
I ain't complainin'; I'm hydroplanin'
Let Capo smash the plaintiff
Now I'm over the sink, tryin' to think and find the kinks
To strengthen Italian links
There is no brakes, no alarms
Just guns, weed, triggers and bitches
The thicker the bitches, the bigger the brick is, shit
Niggas on some bitch shit but
(A change gon' come)
And when it do, you better get with it
Tha Carter 2 triple-exquisite
So bring your friends on your next visit—let's get it
The livin room still gata bunch of youngins in it
Jus waitin on a blunt to hit it and trill comin with it
And Blake probably in the basement on his calisthetics
And Tez probably in the office, bein a mathematician
That's catty-corner to my bedroom; lady in it
Who only wants Weezy' baby in it
Yeah, maybe when I finish gettin' this butter, I'll touch you
But I can't love you; I ain't Usher—I'm all Southern
All brother, you could call the authority
Got you wonderin' how; money got the law ignorin me
Yeah, like I ain't bringin in four a week
And I need more streets
The house need sheetrock
You could hear it all da way down the block
'Cause when you sleep not, we at work, pops
Ain't no stopwatch, ain't no clocks up
When we leave, all you gotta do is put the pots up
We eatin' cheese and bread, we stocked up
So you could put your eggs and tots up, it's not us
When I wake up, I pop up
Another day, another dollar—bitch, holla
This time I've exercised my power
So now I'm singin in da shower
A li'l deodorant, a lil' howard Johnson
Forty bags of powder, get the keys off the counter
I walk out the door and smell a flower
Now I'm about to go get into this album

In jail they don't say too much the codes ain't safe enough
So i'll be on the street and on the road gettin' my paper up
Full but I ain't ate enough
I'm good but I ain't great enough (Uh Uh)
Aye tru turn the faders up
I'm waking up I'm taking up the industries space and I'm wastin' 'em (Yea)
They can't look me in my face and I'm grillin' 'em (Bling)
How my smile worth a million (Ha)

Truth be told I'm the hottest of my era
There will never be a soul that can compare to every level
Ever peddled by the Devil
Me being the Devil
Yep
Hot Boy 'till the grizzle
Gone 'till they miss me
And that's until the blunts burn out
And the liquor is empty
I ain't trippin' cause I did me
Wait I'm trippin' cause I'm still me
Still the little nigga goin' out to get me
If the public got something to say
Well tell them I got something to say
And that is...
