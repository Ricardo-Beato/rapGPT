35 ContributorsSucca Proof Lyrics
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof (Shit so dangerous)
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof (Dangerous)
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof (Dangerous, Lord)
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof

Look, I don't give a fuck what you niggas done
I don't give a fuck where you niggas from
'Fore you run your mouth, go and get a gun
Leave you slumped on the scene, that's a hit and run
Oh, y'all Bloods now? Oh, y'all Crips now?
Fuck it, I'm Big Draws, I'm J. Prince now
I frontline wars we can't fix now
Bought latex gloves, that's no prints now
If you broke bread, you got chip now
Couple things you can't buy inside this town
Loyalty, love, and respect
And niggas will extort you out your check

Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof (Shit so dangerous)
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof (Dangerous)
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof (Dangerous, Lord)
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof

Look, I don't give a fuck how you niggas feel
I could tell the fake, I could tell the real
Got a purple heart out the battlefield
Now watch me levitate to a hundred mil'
Fuck a pound, nigga, fuck appeal
I negotiate a better deal
Fuck around, nigga, yes I will
Take a life 'fore I take a L
Time to even out the playin' field
These niggas wasn't playin' fair
I'm solo and still made it here
Rich real nigga, ask your bitch how that make her feel
Bang

Original badmon
Touch the road and tear couple thousand
Heh, these streets dem a our own
You no love fi trod pon di streets, man will send you home
Head get hotter than a toaster
You violate Rvssian and Kosa
Boy diss Nipsey Hussle
Exercise mi trigger finger muscle

Gangbang, money bang, that's the shit so dangerous
You know the lifestyle dangerous
Oh yeah, those colors so dangerous, Lord
Money, the fame, and the power, this shit so dangerous
I'm with these bitches, so dangerous
You know the streets so dangerous, Lord
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof (Shit so dangerous)
Don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof (Dangerous)
Pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof (Dangerous, Lord)
