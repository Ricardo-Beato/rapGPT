11 ContributorsNorth Pole Lyrics
It's Big Gucci
Mike Will Made-It
Damn (Damn)
Bling
Ear Drummers
Blaww

Red Falcons hat, all red hoodie
Santa Claus of the city, bag full of goodies
50 pints of purple drank came with the seal
I wish these faggot-ass cops would let a nigga live
I'm trynna come down the chimney with a hundred mil(lion)
So many hundred dollar bills that it give you chills
A bad bitch from Brazil, got her on the pill
You wake up, see her cookin' cookies in your crib
I'm the Brick Squad boss, I'm like Santa Claus
Mrs. Claus on the pole with her panties off
And I know when you're sleeping' and know when you awake
No eggnog, but some bottles of that Ace Of Spades
Black Versace shades, so it's hard to see them
Where's Rudolph Red-Nose when I really need him
A bunch of elves on the team and I've gotta feed them
They carry sawed-off pumps, so it's hard to beat them
I gift wrap a pipe-bomb, bring it to your door
Ring the bell, sit back, and watch the fucker blow
So how you build a snowman with all this melted snow
Santa Claus bringing blocks in from Mexico
I made a hundred-thousand dollars at the Texaco
They lock me up, and let me out; I feel like Plaxico
I'm goin' in on these suckers, call me Santa Claus
And it's a bunch of bad bitches in Santa's house
You might also like
A igloo full of snow and a white stove
I'm in the kitchen, cookin' dope in a white robe
House full of naked hoes snortin' blow
I'm in Zone 6, AKA the North Pole
It's so lonely at the top, plus it's real cold
My ears, neck, wrist, fist is real cold
A house full of hoes and they cookin' blow
I'm in Zone 6, AKA the North Pole2Embed
