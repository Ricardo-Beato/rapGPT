7 ContributorsHurt Sumthin LyricsYeah, this for all my mix show DJ's, underground DJ's and wannabe DJ's
Who know how to get the party started, then spin it
This is an introduction of what's about to come
One nation under a groove
Heartbeat, tight work, aw
So for all you party people
This is not rock and roll
This is only for the clubs
Heartbeat, tight work, aw
Mister bartender, I need me a drink to really talk kink so can you pour 'em
Smoke me something that make my eyes chink and wink out ya man see how I score 'em
Check out my pants, the sexy way I dance, then switch my style again cos the method's borin'
Make me a bill, a million dollar bill, I'm on top with you like Alicia fallin'
See I came in this game and I kicked the door in
Slept on me and you still get snorin'
Don't you see I'm on fire, you still ignorin'
That's why I'm rich and you still be poorin'
This beat make you say how mercy Lord is
My voice sound like I've been drinkin' forties
A freak when I speak, I'm talkin' naughty
Comin' soon in your hood, I will be tourin'
Ah, get back, aw, we about to, we about to hurt somethin'
Then you hear about how we keep the club jumpin'
We gon' tear the roof off this mother sucker (jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)
Take that, aw, we about to, we about to hurt somethin'
Then you hear about how we keep the club jumpin'
We gon' tear the roof off this mother sucker

Do you like to eat a lot of sushi
Look at me dance like I am chick fully
Ay sucker what you say (ey, yeah, yeah, yeah)
See I know how to rock the party
Put your hands on that ass and spank somebody
Got my hands up like somebody rob me
Boy, if you got bait, let me see your money
Small dick, get no chicks, I'm truly sorry
But you get the fake digits, no need to call me
