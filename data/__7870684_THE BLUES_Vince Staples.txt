If I die on the way to give you my love
Please, protect me from the world
Forgive me for what I've done
This shit harder than I make it look, what have I become?
I ain't never been no open book
Money made me numb

Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb

Street life will trap you
But my daddy wasn't born a pastor
Need greener pastures
Still waitin' on the rapture
I'm never lonely
Even my daydreams is haunted
I keep gettin' smaller houses but I won't find peace 'til the Lord allows it
You might also like
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it
Waiting 'til the Lord allows it

What's success but guilt and stress?
Ain't too many niggas had to live with that
Movin' on from what you love
Knowin' you won't ever get them feelings back
Heart broke but your ego's still intact
Dark soul, business black
If I reaped what I sowed, I'd be so astounded
No yellow brick road, just public housing
Can you please come post my bail?
It's a hunnid thousand
Know you say you wish me well
But I really doubt it
Who really 'bout it? Can't wait to see
And if I don't come home tonight
Just pray for me
Pray for me (Pray for me)
Pray for me
Pray for me (Pray for me)
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me (Pray for me)8Embed
