29 ContributorsKIOSK Lyrics
Hey, you looking over there
I got something to show you if you got the time to spare
The quality's the highest and the price is very fair
It's honestly the nicest thing that I have ever shared
You look like the type that likes a diamond in his ear
To walk around the town and be so shiny and revered
Come across his boss and be so timely and prepared
Look like a million dollars off of signing with the Bears
I don't mean to be so deeply inside of your affairs
But if I likеd getting ripped off, then I'd bе over there
But that's why I'm over here, with that you should beware
I'm only saying this because I really, really care

I think it's more a temple, not a stall
But, no, not a religion, not at all
I know it's kind of simple and it's small
But that's 'cause it's the middle of the mall
If you wanna show off and just ball
Or your intention is the drawers
We got credentials for it all
Welcome to the middle of the mall

You ain't got a budget for these nuggets
You can keep it Plain Jane or blow out they brains when you in public
The matching ring, chain gon' look insane when you untuck it
They'll never know the difference, even if you let 'em touch it
Now if you are a rapper or a trapper on the job
It don't really matter if you get jacked or you get robbed
You can go on, let 'em have it, it's not a factor or a prob'
Only thing that's gonna happen, you gon' get attacked by all the blogs
But to regular people you gon' be sharp
And you gon' be so attractive on the block
Now, it might make you a magnet for the cops
But please don't let them haters try and drag you from the top
You might also like
You ain't gotta be a criminal involved
Know how to rap or knack for dribbling the ball
Or be a prince or an emperor at all
Everybody's equal in the middle of the mall
We are not the center of applause
But secretly the center of the cause
This is where the finishers evolve
In the middle of the malls

Diamonds only worth what you are willing to pay
A deceptive game you are killing to play
Now I have diamonds, it's odd feeling this way
But when they start to sparkle that star-glittering glaze
It sways, takes your mind off todays
Where preachers can praise AIDS as God killing the gays
What a fucking phrase, never ceases to amaze
But when he dies from cancer, that's God's mysterious ways
Jesus saves African sold slaves
Gabriel's in Afghanistan passing out AKs
It's a rage
The diamond sometimes are suedes while putting 'em to the blade
I have hesitations
There, I've put it all on the table, I have my reservations
Besides, we'll find something else useless to put our faith in
You won't finish this here, we'll pick up after meditation, uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
It seems you've got the spirit of the appalled
And you've got the lyrics and the drawl
I know some people would love to hear it how you call
You should join us in the middle of the mall
I'm cool, man, I've got a watch already
Well, excuse me5Embed
