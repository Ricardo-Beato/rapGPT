Yeah, yeah
Let me get a little bit more beat
Yeah

Ask God if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity
And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free
I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave
I took a nap, beneath a tree in the shade
Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass
Picturin' the images that make you laugh
I left you out to die, but will you take me back? (Back)
Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious (Conscious)
She's naked underneath them shadows
Let the sunlight undress her slow
I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doin' impressions though (Uh-huh)
I'm goin' to the festival, (The festival) need to let me go
I wake up, pop a couple Benadryls, go back to sleep
It's all made up, everything they said was real, it has to be
'Cause actually the master fast asleep
And the castles back-back in his private quarters (Private quarters)
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order (No, no, no)
All this torture, thought I had to warn ya (Had to warn ya)
Leave it all behind and go to California (California) (Go, go)
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzin' this feelin'
Ya can't fathom (Can't fathom) (Can't, can't, can't)
You might also like
(Festival, festival, festival, festival)
My hands are above the clouds
From the clap-clap thunder lookin' down
While you're runnin' around
I lift you up when you drown
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation
Full speed chasin' and you're always runnin' ahead
You're always runnin' ahead
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances
And you battle like a champion, why
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival?
You got angels weepin', see them drippin' from the sky
You watch 'em with your third eye (So, so, so)
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival? (To the festival)
To the festival (To the festival)
To the festival (To the festival)
Festival (Festival)
Festival (Festival)


Hola, Malcolm
Hey, man, it's, it's Luis, man
I'm calling, man, tell you about the album
I listen, it's good
I need to tell you, man
I tell everyone to, to listen to the music
And it sound like they like it, man
It sound like they good. I tell my wife, "I'm so proud of him."
I tell my girlfriend, "I'm so proud of him."
And the album is good
It's so good
I cannot believe
Anyone can be you
No one can beat you15Embed
