7 ContributorsWe About To Get Hectic Lyrics

Cause it about to get hectic
Cause we about to get hectic

The streets got a nigga stressed out of type, bugging
I'm struggling, digging my ways out of holes by hustling
So, what's a day's function? Pain reliever? Fever inducer?
And held a chocolate Thai Buddha, now I'm looser
I fantasize about this crew I took last week
And yo, that's me at the sympathy, to pass me
But I was brought to reality, a rude awakening
My man just got taken, it's mad time he's facing
Jetted upstairs, got a call from my cousin
Back in Brooklyn, only fifteen the kid is bugging
Told me about the spot that he hit that had a drop on the spot
But his man almost got shot
Now it's the talk of the block cause he's dead and in the cab
The Troy Ave laughed, then he started tumble (?)
Counted the cash, but one nigga tried to stash
Who wet the quills? niggas was up in his ass
As he kicked it, by the little story that he told
I was fickled in his hold, then off the old gold
Till I got to be on the other line, put him on hold
It was my shorty, told her call me back, kid you're too old
It was a quarter to one, Friday night
Loaded up my guns to blow the horns, called up my son
Son, you come through I got a proposition for you
Keep it on the low so the plan won't spoil
My crew's loyal, they came over in a minute
To kick it 'bout this nigga, who think he getting bigger
Pumping on our side, don't even know him from a hole
In the wall, tonight's going to be his downfall
So fuck him and everything he stand for
About this time, he be on the corner
Slinging with a crackhead, kept me bringing
Sales to the building, a bunch of bitches fiending
I figure we could get the goods, kill the nigga
And be it that we live right next to the river
We can catch him off guard, throw him in the water
Before the coastguards come on God this shit ain't hard
But think, the one you give a couple up's your fate
And keep your eyes open for the jakes, the snakes and the snitches
The ones you see, the nigga with the riches
Acting like a little bunch of bitches
Pointing me out in pictures
The Five-O's like "you know who is this"
It's Havoc, you better recognise it, realise
You might also like

In morn' store, for y'all niggas who once swore
Sure to trigger press, to lick you in the jaw
Raw, bullet holes, all in your clothes
Your Volv's, now you lay with your eyes closed
In a casket you bastard, you went too fast kid
Shouting why I motherfucking blasted
Hectic, I can't believe the shit beneath my eyes
I cannot think straight, or I might get hypnotised
I don't stress shit, cause I'm out to get mines
So when you step to me, you will be surprised
The type of shit I kick is so you're leaking in the skies
So when you say the Mobb Deep time is a lie
You'll be swimming in a puddle of Death, and that's no threat
Hectic, hectic, hectic, hectic

When things get real, it ain't what you expected
Me and my peoples is known to get hectic
Only to wreck shit, many slugs in all directions
Make them see the light when my shots make connections
Niggas get they face split in sections
Shook using ice grill looks for they protection
We absorb everything you fear
And indulge in a crime-filled atmosphere
This shit ain't nothing new, it's only things that we used to
We used to stick niggas on the F through to the E train
When it's time to recruit, I humble on the D train
See my man D only to purchase my dope thang
Word to my unborn seed
A nigga got to make loot to support greed
On the wild side of the fence, the shit is on the verge of explosion
It's so cold you might get frozen
If you leave yourself vulnerable, in time lapsing
Fools collapsing, and caught up in gun clapping
Don't matter who you are, if you know many faces
I don't discriminate, my shots bleed all races
And cultures, we sort of like vultures
Eating your insides like ulcers
And pause niggas pulses, like
