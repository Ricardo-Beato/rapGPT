5 ContributorsCoconut Ciroc Lyrics
Started out local, but I ain't motherfuckin' local
Got two million worth of jewelry on one of six sofas
Got a pocket full of fifties like a damn club promoter
And these crackers wanna see me on a Most Wanted poster
Who are you supposed to be? ('Posed to be?)
Say that you's an OG, but really
Nigga you just O.V, O.V
I'm cooking dope in L.V, Louis
Remix a brick in double G's, Gucci
I just sold a thousand P's in Fendi
My sweater and my drawers and my jeans Burberry
Coconut Cîroc mixed with molly cranberry

(Wasted!) Coconut
(Wasted!) Coconut Cîroc
(I'm Wasted!) Coconut
(Wasted!) Coconut Cîroc mixed with molly cranberry

Just to stand next to me, gotta be initiated
I'm in here with the plug, tell the hoe to get naked
She wanna fuck the kid, I tell her, "Baby, be patient."
She say her name's "Asia", but she don't look Asian
Remember being broke, a nigga not having shit
True hit me with a split, I pulled the 
Hermes belt, just to hold my Trues up
Dirty forty shawty, if you move you'll get bust
Phone going crazy, I just had a good rush
I was standing on the corner from the dawn 'til the dusk
Ayy, this an Audemars beat, I'll drop you for a fee
Got a condo right by Lenox just to fuckin' smoke weed (Strong)
Drunker than a motherfucker throwin' bands up
On that Coconut Cîroc, and I'm pourin' Xans up
I'm a get-money nigga, go and put your hands up
I'm a get-money, bitch, let me see you stand up
