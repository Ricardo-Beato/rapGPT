15 ContributorsHit Another Lick Lyrics
Old face hundreds (Yeah)
New face twenties (Yeah)
Damn, Gucci Mane just took my money (Yeah)
I sell a lot of pies (Yeah)
I robbed a couple guys (Yeah)
I'm stuntin' like a bitch 'cause I hit another lick (Yeah)
Old face hundreds (Yeah)
New face twenties (Yeah)
Damn, Gucci Mane just took my money (Yeah)
I sell a lot of pies
I robbed a couple guys (Yeah)
I'm stuntin' like a bitch 'cause I hit another lick (Yeah)

Man, I started stealing candy I was just six (Hood classics, you bastard)
My mama close friends said I'd never be shit (Be shit)
Eight, seven, nigga, I was taking kids' shit
Started jacking, shawty, let me get that, bitch (Let me get that, bitch)
1989, I was only nine
I wasn't slinging keys, I was tuckin' for a dime (I was tuckin' for a dime)
Mountain Park apartments, everybody on the grind (Everybody)
Sun Valley apartments, everybody got a nine
It was 1992 and I was just twelve
Had a run-in with the law and they put my ass in jail (Damn)
Juvenile, fifty G's, got me in an hour
Twelve years old with the money and the power (Damn)
I was fourteen selling flour and powder
Made eighteen bucks an hour counting up product
I was fourteen selling flour for powder
Eighty bucks an hour counting up product

I was fourteen bringing a .38 to school (Baow)
A deuce-deuce in my locker and was known to cut a fool (Baow)
I always packed the tool
I always played it cool
Driving Chevy Caprice, bought seventeen nines and painted it blue (Yeah)
Matter fact, that bitch was purple, it would be like a fool
That was 1998, I just stopped goin' to school (Uh)
Bought a brick, hit a lick, then I got my new tattoo (Yeah)
Gucci held in the mic, tell them pussies what to do (Yeah)
One time, I hit a lick and I didn't know how to act
I started laughing when they asked me to bring the money back (Hahaha)
One time, I hit a lick and I didn't know how to act
I started laughing when they asked me to bring the money back, ha

2002, a nigga had to do (What?)
What he had to do
That's why I robbed you (True)
2003, you know I needed weed (Knew)
I know you had them kis
That's why I took your cheese (That's why I did it)
2K-four, I wound a nigga door (What?)
I layed him on the floor
Then shot him in the nose (Baow)
They taking off they clothes (Baow)
I'm murkin' all my foes (Yo)
I spanked his mammy house (Graow)
Now he let it go (Baow)
The game unfolds
I'm jumping out a Rolls (Yeah)
I robbed so many niggas that I rarely use my phone (Wow)
My pistol bought a bone (Wow), my pistol bought a coupe (Woah)
Your pistol is for show (Wow), but my pistol bring me loot (Graow, baow)
