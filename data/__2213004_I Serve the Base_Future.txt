I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base (Uh, uh), I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base (Yeah)

You would fuck a rich nigga for the fame, won't you?
You would give that pussy up to a lame, won't you?
Like an old school, I re-did the frame on you
I got my old shooters with me and they land on you
Word to them niggas out the six
A whole lotta lean my nutrition
They should've told ya I had the drank on me
They should've told ya I brung a bank with me
They should've told ya I keep that molly on me
They should've told ya I got that stick with me
You the one who duckin' from a drive-by
My niggas unemployed sellin' Popeyes

I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base

I keep a shooter with me like Malone
I fucked around and did it on my own
Come and fuck with me, baby, I'm a franchise
Molly and them Xans got me aggravated
Them hundreds and them fifties, got 'em separated
Put them hundreds with them hundreds, yeah, we segregated
They tried to take the soul out me
They tried to take my confidence and they know I'm cocky
Fuck another interview, I'm done with it
I don't give a fuck about lil' ho', I let young hit it
I play the games of the thrones with you
I can't change, I was God-given
Tried to make me a pop star and they made a monster
I'm posted with my niggas lettin' the champagne flow
A nigga was depressed now my mind back home
A product of the roaches in them ashtrays
I inhale the love on a bad day
Baptized inside purple Actavis

They should've told you I was on a pill
They should've told you I was on a Lear
I served cocaine in some Reeboks
I'm full of so much chronic, need a detox

I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base

They should've told you I was just a trap nigga
I'm in the white house shootin' craps niggas
I gave up on my conscience, gotta live with it
This remind me when I had nightmares
These bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
They should've told you I was just a trap, nigga
They should've told you I was gon' lap niggas
They should've told you I was overseas
Say his last words, he can't breathe
They sent the ghetto bird out to peep me
They finally did admit that I was cloned
Because I was ambitious, now I'm on
Five in the mornin' on the corner rollin' stones
I just brought the money, I'll count it on my own
Fuck
They should've told you I was on a pill
They should've told you I was on a Lear
I served cocaine in some Reeboks
I'm full of so much chronic, need a detox

I serve the base, I serve the base
I serve the base, I serve the base

You the one who duckin' from a drive-by
My niggas unemployed sellin' Popeyes48Embed
