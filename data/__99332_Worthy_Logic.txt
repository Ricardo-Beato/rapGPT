21 ContributorsWorthy Lyrics
My mentor once told me, that fire cannot be denied, I'm twenty years old, and I've sacrificed the last four years of my life, to create music just for you, my social life, staying in the studio, practicing, grinding, just to give you, a soundtrack for your life, so I'm gonna continue to wake up every day and make good music, and get that recognition

And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it

Uh, yeahâ€”
Now, let me switch it up with some shit you ain't ever heard
Ain't drunk, but the flow's slurred
Everybody just relax and listen to my words
Everybody just relax and listen to my words
So many times have I designed a similar rhyme
That came to mind
You're never to find the way I'm feelin' now
You're never to find the way I'm feelin' now
You're never to find the way I'm feelin' now
I'm feeling like I'm ready to blow
Been waiting patiently, but fuck it, now I gotta go
When it comes to making this music, man, it's nada, yo
See? You can't comprehend the amount of heart that I'm givin'
Hip-hop's my chauffeur, so you know I'm driven
Sunrise to sunset, you know how I'm living
You see I think it, then write it, read it, repeat it
Then lace it, produce it, record it, mix it, then master it
So the people adore it
You might also like
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it9Embed
