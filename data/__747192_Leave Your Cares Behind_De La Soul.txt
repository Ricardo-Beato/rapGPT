4 ContributorsLeave Your Cares Behind Lyrics
I love the way you make me feel
On Saturday

Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold up, back up the track and grab your rollerskates y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
The sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' thick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, I'm really and willin'
No hackeysack, let let me in
Slip on the bottom I'mma slip away
And have a ball on a Saturday

I love, I love, I love, I love it when you do it on a Saturday
On Saturday
You might also like
You go back once more with the wallop in the score
Sponsor ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
Sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights (what else?)
I'm diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life
Slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss the briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
Unfasten that sleeve around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody, come on everybody, come on everybody

Leave your cares behind
Leave your cares behind (on a Saturday)
Leave your cares behind
Leave your cares behind (on a Saturday)
Are ya ready kids? (Aye aye, captain!)
I can't hear you! (Aye aye, captain!)
Oooooooooooooooooh!
Shut up!Embed
