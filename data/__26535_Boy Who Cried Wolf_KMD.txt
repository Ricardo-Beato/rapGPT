9 ContributorsBoy Who Cried Wolf Lyrics
(...Yeah) I started off with a question
Can you perceive
Right before your ears move trickin
My voice box make the choice to believe
Yeah I see youre rootin
For the words that I'm tootin
Im just a pusher of this thing called money
But whatcha smokin whats that ya gettin in
Stop to buildin and growin
To jump the hurdle that the wolf said suck
Hes a wolf!..And you a sheep
Hes a wolf!..And you a sheep

I greet you peace but why call me money guy
Do I resemble he who never told a white one
Or him who freed us so where stands I
Raise another question which ones the right one
Some wish to live the single sing'em
They know the half I know them from sixty
If we all live the single how can we all sing
Im creative but you can't remix me
Hes a wolf!..And you a sheep
Hes a wolf!..And you a sheep
You might also like
They are nasty they will bite
And if cornered they will fight
Never ever go near..a wolf?

Concerning the N-word why's when I say it it gets no play
Officially it means stupid or ignorant
Stay stupid or ignorant in place anyway
Any how whats reinforced I can't out figure it
I figure blue and donna grasp a stick shot is simple
Now heres the plan strictly between you and me
Through communication comes the unination
And no wolf can down a brick house unity
So feel free to dance but this is not all I heel the think
Beware sheep of wolf in sheeps sun burn
We bit his brand and we wear his clothing
Then he mocks us in return
Wolfman, whats up with this vibe you sendin me?
What are you anyway my friend or my foe?
The way this is going you might just be the end of me
And I still dwell here even though (He's a wolf!)
And you a sheep
Hes a wolf!..And you a sheep
K-n-o-w
War would trouble ya to Hell
However take you express no shovel
This is the land of the frightened
The place of the slave and occassional unheard muffle
Its up to you to decide by the fruit that his tree provides
If not I'll embark by myself on the archany
Marches the boy who cried (He's a wolf!)
And you a sheep
Hes a wolf!..And you a sheep

Now listen past your ear
Just remember this my dear
Never ever go near.. a wolf?
Hes a wolf! And you a sheep
Hes a wolf! And you a sheep
Hes a wolf! And you a sheep
Hes a wolf! And you a sheep
And you a sheep
And you a sheepEmbed
