Hello, old friend from the road
I wanted to write a note
To let you know that all in all, it ain't all what it seems
I feel like I've hit a low
One I've never hit before
Lately, I've been feeling small as the salt in the sea
Oh, it's so much to do in so little of time
I feel like I fell a little behind
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
It seems so out of reach
The place I want to be
Whoever thought I'd get there anyway?
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now before I go

Oh, Blue, I wrote for you
To say I'm gonna run away from home
Oh, Blue, I love you, too
But today, I'm gonna run away from home
You might also like
Oh, I weep through the night
Can't find a love who loves me the same
Or as much as you do
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
Oh, I reach out my hand hoping that they'll see
I'm more than what everyone tells me
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
See, I'm getting tired of the way I've been living
I'd rather die than to live with these feelings
Stuck in this world where there's so much to prove
Every win gives you more room to lose
It's too many ups and downs on the ride
I spent inordinate 'mounts of time
Trapped in a lonely, loner life
Looking for love where I'm denied

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now before I go

Oh, Blue, I wrote for you
To say I'm gonna run away from home
Oh, Blue, I love you, too
But today, I'm gonna run away from home
Away from home
Oh, oh
Today, I'm gonna run away
Today, I'm gonna run away15Embed
