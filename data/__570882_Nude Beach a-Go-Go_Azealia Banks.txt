Teenage Verona, sippin Coca-Cola
Teenage Verona, Momma Can't Control Her!

Nude Beach a Go-Go
Nude Beach a Go-Go
You can do anything at
Nude Beach  a Go-Go
Ram-a-lama-ding-dong, surfer Billy bing-bong
Nude Beach a Go-Go
Nude Beach a Go-Go
You can tag along, if you're young and strong
Nude Beach a Go-Go
Nude Beach  a Go-Go
Black women's attraction
All the white girls join in the action
Do you jingle when you dingle-dangle?
Everybody does the bingle-bangle, Ow!
Nude Beach a Go-Go
Nude Beach a Go-Go
Don't ya don't ya know-know?
Sun tan in the snow-snow
You might also likeEverybody goes where the roses bloom
Come and enjoy the living rooms
By the lifeguard station by the coral reef
Hallelujah, Heaven, Hell and all in between
There's no clothes to wear
And there's summer in her hair
And chiffon and silk and wool and cotton
They all are forgotten!

Teenage Verona, sippin Coca-Cola
Teenage Verona, Momma Can't Control Her!
Nude Beach a Go-Go (7x)
Oooooooooh - Ow!


At Nude Beach a Go-Go, Ah!6Embed
