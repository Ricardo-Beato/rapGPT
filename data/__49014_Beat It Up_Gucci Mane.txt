26 ContributorsBeat It Up Lyrics
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down

I hop up out my bed, got my swag on
Scrambled eggs, filet mignon, two trees blown just for cologne
Money never limited, so icy with benefits
My driver need a passport, all my cars are immigrants
It's so sickenin', history you're witnessin'
I had a girl, she quit me, now I'm single, wanna get with me?
Sticky cannot stick to me, if you see your chick with Gucci
Think before confrontin' 'ruly, ain't my fault your lady choosin'
4:30, still blowin' purpy, O.A. Verdy rollin' dirty
Wardrobe clean, that's just detergent, got your girlfriend pickin' purses
Say she lonely, Gucci only one way to meet me in person
When she get me home my nigga told me that she love my verses

It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down
You might also like
Your girlfriend keep callin' me, I feel like she stalkin' me
You at home and she with me, so mornin' it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin' it, beatin' her down straight poundin' it
Drillin' on your sheets, got your blanket at the laundromat
Way baby girl throw it back, old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane now hardly there, smack it like I'm mad at that
Sweaty sex, so passionate, oral sex, she mastered that
Pornographic poses like she posin' for the Internet
One hour not finished yet, never been a minute man
Always been a business man, got her catchin' feelings, man
Got a man? Oh really, ma'am? Actin' like I give a damn
Used to like her, now I don't, got a real short attention span

It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down

Gucci, Trey Songz, put it on, my shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song, she got on my favorite thong
She so hot, too hot to touch, to feel it, too much for lames
Gucci Mane, I'm extra clean, so extra rubbers on my brain
Got your main thing screamin' Gucci, every Tuesday night we do it
Wish we could do it more often, but I'm often somewhere flossin'
Lay it down like carpet, Barbie, Aston Martin, double-park it
Beat it like we got a problem, pop her 'til she call me papa
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down2Embed
