14 ContributorsMultiples Lyrics
Right now, we gonna get together and give you a tune
That we had a lot of requests for...

I never gave props to emcees who don't deserve it
Never smoked rocks, never had guts to serve it
Never had a Glock, never seemed to be worth it
Never had I thought life was gonna be perfect
Never hit the chicks unless I have a jimmy hat
Never leave the crib unless I have my shit intact
Never do I say a rhyme unless the beat is fat
Best believe that, never will the Spawn come wack
I never went to court, never had to serve trial
Never went to jail, had no records on file
Never disrespect, never treat my friends wild
Cause I never had real friends till now

So this goes to those
Who be supporting at the shows
And this goes to those
Who's always working on they flows
And this goes to those
Who use music intake to escape
Finding love and happiness inside a mix-tape
And this goes to those
Whose criticism is constructive
And this goes to those
Who lyrically we just can't fuck with
And this goes to those
Whose love is so strong
You can shut your eyes and see them when you listen to they songs
This goes to those
Who eat and sleep with turntables
This goes to those
Who say "Fuck the major labels"
And this goes to those
Who, unsigned and dead broke
Can still make a name before they even make a demo
This goes to those
Who keep the freight trains lit up
And this goes to those
Who roam the night just to get up
And this goes to those
Who tag and paint walls with aerosol
Lost city crew, from Minneap to St. Paul
This goes to those
Who flip the b-boy acrobatics
And this goes to those
Who put the ball in the baskets
This goes to those
Of you who listen to the lyrics
Cause this flow's for those who can dig the Atmosphere shit
You might also like
It's like that shit
It's like this shit
True heads are the real music critics
Was always better with flows
Then I was with shoulder pose
But no matter where you live my man the love is multiples

Anxiety: That's my new drug of choice
Society: Where you go when you lose your voice
Rivalry: Stems from the shit your man's telling me
Don't lie to me, I know the real definition is jealousy
Observation: That's my tactic to complain
Conversation: Distract you while I pick your brain
Atmosphere: Up-there lyrical unit
That leaves the average emcee confused like a eunuch
Nonetheless: That's how I often change the subject
Second guess: That's what they all do to Slug's shit
Ironic: Most kids pale in comparison to my phonics
So come inhale some embarrassment
Roller-coaster: A metaphor for my delivery
Overdose: Results of having battle tendencies
Activated: Every time its my turn to rip
But "masturbated" means that you finally came to grip
So reality must mean: guns, bitches, and weed
Cause salary is what comes from: guns, bitches, and weed
Integrity means you're in pain cause you're in love
Collectively means that none of y'all could fuck with Slug
It's like that, never the wack, an actual fact
It's like act transglobal and local, so hold me back
It's like damn aimless, tenseness, wandering
It's a struggle, between what you can give and what you want to
