Can't live without you, baby
Live without you
It’s like (Oh, baby)

I been smooth for so long, I'm tryna get rough
Fuck buffin' my nails, dawg, I’m tryna get buff
Fuck shapin' my beard up, I'm likin' the scruff
And fuck the hills 'cause I'm livin' my life in the cut
Can't imagine that I’m gon’ meet my wife in the club
We gon' see though, I feel like she more of a CEO
Or maybe she doin’ volunteer work in Rio
It's not like I need her but I would love to meet her
Another day, another dollar, another phone with another feature
I don't play goalie but I'm my brother’s keeper
Surrounded by family, I'm not with other people
They say I got my pops' demeanor and mother's features
The Garden still Private as ever, the gang thrivin' together
Ya boy's strivin' to be the most dominant ever
The hardest white boy since the one who rapped about vomit and sweaters
And hold the comments 'cause I promise you I'm honestly better than whoever came to your head right then
They ain't cut from the same thread like him
They don't study, doin' work to get ahead like him
They don't toss and turn in the fuckin' bed like him
You might also like
'Cause they don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it

I been laid back so long, I'm tryna get turnt
Fuck searchin' my name, dawg, that's how you get hurt
Fuck bein' likable, I'm tryna be unbreakable
I just realized that this whole game is takeable
If I want it and I do, yes, I want it
I don't care how you feel about it, I do what I wanna
I used to look up to the people that I'm movin' in front of
It's not that crazy anymore, my city used to a come up
Bryson, Jack, Gee, James is up next
The rest is up to me, these lames is upset
My peers get upstaged, the fans are obsessed
My city is upcomin', its people are oppressed
And I'm gon' change things
I'm up at Carmichael's, tryna get on the same page
I heard about the rapper that you claim was a mainstay
They had a nice run, but they never gon' maintain because

They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it2Embed
