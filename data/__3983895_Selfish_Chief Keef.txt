18 ContributorsSelfish Lyrics
Loud and clear
Counting kills
I might rip
Ice on yeah
We roll deep
In the street
Fucking street
Fucking me

Can you hear me yeah, loud and clear
You see me counting money Foe 'nem counting kills
Don't make me mad, I might rip
Off your fucking face with all this ice on yeah
How we roll? We roll deep
You ain't no fucking ghost, we catch you in the street
Hell nah, he ain't fucking street
I look in the mirror, I see fucking me
I come from the slums (yeah)
Dirt on my thumb (yeah)
Sneak diss the don (yeah)
Get hit with thunder
You ain't even on (yeah)
This dope be stronger than
All of you fuck niggas
And my chopper (yeah)
You might also like
This bankroll broke the rubber band
All that fucking talking, y'all ain't saying shit
Bitch a fucking don is what I am
This bitch steady telling me that I ain't shit
Do a drive-by in a Ram
You want beef, we make you a sandwich
You know that we with it, nigga yeah
Grab the blick, get at y'all myself cuz I'm selfish

All this ice on I ain't melting
You might see me in a fucking coupe
What's up in my cup it's juice
And it ain't no fucking deuce
All I know is fucking poo'
We don't know who the fuck to shoot
I just spilled hi tech
All over my running shoes
All I see is green think it's a sign
Tell me the fucking price and I'm buying
Make me let 'em loose they come through firing
And they go n' get you everytime
Imma stack up that cash
Imma say fuck them strags
On the way to fuck with my jeweler
I ain't had enough of that yet
I'mma say fuck it they mad
Bitches better stay where they at
Make them suffocate where they at
Till they want to play where they at
This bankroll broke the rubber band
All that fucking talking, y'all ain't saying shit
Bitch a fucking don is what I am
This bitch steady telling me that I ain't shit
Do a drive-by in a Ram
You want beef, we make you a sandwich
You know that we with it, nigga yeah
Grab the blick, get at y'all myself cuz I'm selfishEmbed
