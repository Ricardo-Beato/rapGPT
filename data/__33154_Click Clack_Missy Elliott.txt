Woo!

When I walk up in the club, they be pushin’
Misdemeanor got that ice to keep them lookin’ (Uh-huh)
Crop top, drop tops on my Phantom man
They trippin’ and them haters just pussies
Feelin’ on me, feelin’ on me like a porn star
I drive fast car, still shave my cho-cha (Uh-huh)
Get the cash, get the cheddar, get the beams mean (Ahh)
Ching-a-ling, bling-bling, my money real green

Who dat? Who dat? Playa betta fall back
So step back, playa betta fall back
Click, clack, cock back, semi automatic track
Drink a lot of similac, shorty betta fall back (Woo!)

I fall down, get up, then I gotta dust it off (Uh-huh)
Say you dust it off?!
Yeah, I quickly dust it off
I'm off the wall, I do brawl
Don't stall, yes it's on
Said it’s on, I can't be cloned
You can call me Mike Jones
3-0-5 2-1-2 8-0-4 my cell
Y'all must dumb as hell (Woo!)
If ya’ll think that is my cell
Hotel, motel, holiday don't play
’Round the way, O.J., yeah, I'm so icey (Ahh)
What them haters say, “Misdemeanor okay” (Uh-huh)
Call me 4 a play, position more than 40 ways (Uh-huh)
Like a chocolate glaze, I'm hotter than a summer day
Stingray, Sugar Ray
Knuckles all up in your face
You might also like
Who dat? Who dat? Playa betta fall back
So step back, playa betta fall back
Click, clack, cock back, semi automatic track
Drink a lot of similac, shorty betta fall back

I blocka-blocka, straight jocka
Matter fact, the face snappa
Money stacka, no slacka
Hit bracka, gun strappa
I click-click, hear my “click-click”
Two snaps, you hit
Then I click-click
I make cash, pay them bills
I pay them bills to buy new wheels
I wear high hills, I touch and feel
Catch me in your man grill
My record deal, my movie deal is super sick-sick
I click-click and if you doubt me I click-click (Uh-huh)
Smack dem boi's, I will destroy
Hit-hit, straight down and spilt-spilt ya boi
I kick-kick like karate flicks-flicks
Ya get ya ass bit, don't make me have click-click

Who dat? Who dat? Playa betta fall back
So step back, playa betta fall back
Click, clack, cock back, semi automatic track
Drink a lot of similac, shorty betta fall backEmbed
