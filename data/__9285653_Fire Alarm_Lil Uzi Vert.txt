Top Floor
Sleep on me if you wanna
I can't even see myself, be myself, be myself (Uh)
I can't even see myself, I'm myself, I'm myself
I can't see myself, hurt myself, hurt myself
I can't be myself, see myself, fuck myself (I wanna see it)
I can't be myself, see myself, I'm myself (Bring light in this motherfucker that's in this bitch)
I can't be myself, see myself, slice myself (Woah, don't be shy)
I can't sell my soul, clean my soul, slice my soul (Just be myself)
I can't be myself, see myself, freak myself (Woah)
Freak myself
I can't free myself
The fire alarm, the fire alarm (Freak myself, I can't be myself)
The fire alarm, the fire alarm (I can't by myself)

Take your bitch, call emergency
Ain't no bitch never heard of me (Freak myself)
I fuck hoes off burgundy, she said "Can I get a Birkin, please?" (Yeah, freak myself)
I did three hoes in one day, so I gave my fourth girl dirty D (Freak myself)
In her jaw, she want a breaker, Ed, Edd and Eddy like Double D (Freak myself)
Sent her an Uber, like "Come to me"
I ain't even touch her, she cum for me (Freak myself)
Takin' these percs, she numb for me
Fuck on her friends, 'cause she wrong for me (Freak myself)
You might also like
Don't be nervous (Fuck on her friends, 'cause she wrong for me)
I just want you to go crazy when the beat drop, just like, just—
Go extra like just one time
Takin' these percs, she numb for me
Fuck on her friends, yeah, she wrong for me
(Freak myself)

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah
Takin' these pills, and these pills got me outer space
Got me out of my mind, I went and—, aagh
All of my money, my pants, my money, my money, my pants
My watch on my wrist, yeah, it cost your advance
My Richard, my Richard, my Richard a millie
It cost way more than your lil' Rollie
I treat my foreign like it was a stoley
I put the ice on my ankle like goalie
Diamond my neck and it can't get no colder
Solitaire ring, and my neck is boulder
Love for my job, but I'm still sellin' coca
I know some bitches addicted to soda
I like this bitch, but I can't even hold her
None of these bitches, we really don't own 'em
Yellow stones on me, they look like it's sunny
One of my chains on my neck is a Franko
It was a dip in the ocean like Homer
None of these niggas, they fresher than Uzi
Feelin' up on me like an organ donor, woah
None of these niggas, they fresher than Uzi
Feelin' up on me like an organ donor
She gave me head like that bitch got diploma
Can pour up a four, but I ain't want paloma
She pull up on me to handle the boner
Original YSL, bitch, I'm a stoner (Ahh), woo, woo
The fire alarm, the fire alarm
The fire alarm, the fire alarm
The fire alarm, the fire alarm
The fire alarm, the fire alarm
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo
