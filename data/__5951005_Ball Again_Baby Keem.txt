Like "Oh my God"

Born to ball again
Yeah, I been born to ball again
I might just make a band, bitch, I been born to ball again
I might Randy Moss a friend, bitch, I been born to ball again
I'm born to ball again, bitch, I've been born to ball again (Like "Oh my God")
Born to ball again
Yeah, I been born to ball again
I might just make a band, bitch, I been born to ball again
I might Randy Moss a friend, bitch, I been born to ball again
I'm born to ball again bitch I’ve been born to ball again

I born to fall again, bitch, I been born to scholar that
From the city where the niggas want to see you fall back in
And they jealous in this, niggas realy wanna see me split
Had to let my girl back in
Please release my soul of sin
Bitch, I relay race against the fucking time, hope the lord forgive me
Head on me, this better be one time, hopе the Lord forgive me
I might flеx the bezel, let it shine, hope that y'all all feel me
I'ma claim the world and make it mine

I got racks on me
I got stats on me, like "Where you been?"
Ballin' fatally until my time to see
See the god
Why your girl on me
She drooling over me like "Oh my God"
Don't you see this denim?
Don't you see this denim with the squad?
Don't you see this snake skin?
Bitch, it's full of venom, like "Oh my God"
Living like a menace you live out your welcome, what the fuck?
Any many bitties we just call em fitties, what the fuck?
Ray band, ray band with me
Ray band, ray band with me, what the fuck?
Born to ball again
Yeah, I been born to ball again
I might just make a band, bitch, I been born to ball again
I might Randy Moss a friend, bitch, I been born to ball again
I'm born to ball again bitch I’ve been born to ball again (Like "Oh my God")
Born to ball again
