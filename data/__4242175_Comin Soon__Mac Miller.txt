5 ContributorsComin Soon’ Lyrics
When I was just a little one (Uh-huh), I did sit still once
My cousins used to call me Hit-N-Run
I learned a lot from my homies and a lot from my fam
All my, all my peoples really made me who I am (Yup)
My grandma passed, I was savin' her a dance
I didn’t understand why I never got the chance (Why'd you take her?)
But if it's anything she taught me, never give up
My enemies is waitin’ for a slip-up (Nope)
So when I'm down, I get up (Get up)
Clock is tickin', it's either rap shit or a spot in prison (Uh-uh)
I ain't got no, got no time to spare
Seats is fillin' up, better find a chair (Find a chair)
Sugar-sweet rhymes from the finest pears
And a lot comin' for me 'cause the grind is there (Uh-huh)
Well, I just had a little piece of mind to share
Face-up on Times Square, it look fine there (Chyeah)

If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin’ of it (And that’s the way it go down)
In due time (Mac Miller), in this grind ()
In a theater near you (The motherfuckin' Jukebox), I’ll be comin' soon (Class Clown comin' soon)
In a theater near you, I'll be comin’ soon (But I'ma get back up into the second verse for y'all)

Aight, what?
There's a lot of speculation on my future as it is
Am I for real or just a can on the computer for the kids? (Uh-huh)
Not a damn thing right now is buzzin' in the biz
In Pittsburgh, "Well, he nothin' next to Wiz"
I address the class with class, a class act, oh
That's Mac, only 'bout the facts
Rap gettin' littered on, I'm pickin' up the trash
And this track gettin' shitted on, spittin' out the ass
I got cruel intentions (Uh-huh), usin' weapons (Chyeah)
And you a piece of shit I just stepped in (Stepped in)
I still do it for the city, do it for my block
A movie in your mind, I do it for hip-hop
You might also like
If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin' of it (I do it for hip-hop)
In due time, in this grind ()
In a theater near you (I do it for hip-hop), I'll be comin' soon (So we gon' take it to the top)
In a theater near you, I'll be comin' soon (I do it for hip-hop)

One time
The kid Mac, he be spittin' somethin' special
And I'm ready, hear the whistles from the kettle (Yep)
Shootin' missiles out my pencil with my pedal to the metal (Metal)
Startin' every day with a bowl of Fruity Pebbles
Then I'm gone, things are never gon' change (Change)
Words released out this little thing I call my brain (Yep)
And you're all insane thinkin' I'm in class, 'cause I'm hatin' school (Uh-huh)
Breakin' rules, haven't been to school in a day or two
To name a few, 'cause it's killin' me to study
It really isn't funny, seemin' sillier than putty (Haha)
I'm just chillin', burnin' Dutchies while I'm supposed to be in class (What?)
I pass grass to get a laugh, supposed to be in math
I'm an abstract, class-act cat with my hat back (Hat back)
Bitches holdin' onto blunts, better pass that
Gettin' high, findin' anything to laugh at (Haha)
'Cause we gon' take it to the top

If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin' of it
In due time, in this grind ()
In a theater near you, I'll be comin' soon
In a theater near you, I'll be comin' soonEmbed
