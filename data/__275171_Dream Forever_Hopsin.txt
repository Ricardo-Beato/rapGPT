57 ContributorsDream Forever Lyrics
You're the only girl who never disrespected me
You always know how to bring out the best in me
Cupid shot us separately
Then we came together, it was destiny
I love you ‘till there ain’t no loving left in me, definitely
Our souls will ride together, even when the stars die
And when parted, my heart cries
It's angels like you, who make it hard why?
It's cause you beautiful, outgoing and smart
And shit you really set the bar high
All you bring to me is happy moments
You make me feel like I'm cute even though my face got all this acne on it
The way I feel for you, you can't revoke it
Cause it changed me, and my family knows it
Damn, we both just kind of fell into this
You gave me proof that heaven exist
But tell me, what is love without a headache or twist?
You come taunting, every night after twelve when I'm unconscious
You never come out when the sun's watching
Baby, I need you

Where are you? Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you
You might also like
I wake up in the morning with this sensational pain
It goes straight to the brain then my day is invaded with rain
Engraved in my veins is your name, this ain't gonna change
It is staying remain unless my heart is deflated and drained
Your love is magic
Daydreaming about you is such a habit
Thought I saw you when I was driving
But I was stuck in traffic
If other girls flirt they're sadly mistaken
I tell em' scram cause they need to know I'm happily taken
You see my love life, it wasn't going well till I found you
Fellas get jealous and doubtful when I tell em' about you
I know we had our fair share in the past, with selfish lust
But once we came together we sealed it and nailed it shut
Your touch is that of a goddess
When we kiss, I'm at a lack of words
Especially when we pull away
And then you smile afterwards
In our hearts, we're no different in color
We live for each other, I'm glad you're my significant other
I love you

Where are you? Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you
Baby it saddens me to know that you only exist in dreams
I sit and fiend for you when I'm awake
And it seems like I’ll never be happy unless I sleep
I failed to see the point in living without you
It got me thinking death is sweet
I’ll never know unless I leap, I guess I reach for the stars
Cause girl I'm in love with you oh so desperately
What I'm about to do I kept discrete
I rest the cheek on the pillow as I'm counting sheep
Take me to ecstasy
I tried to get you out my head, the pain's a lot worse
I love you more than anything, I won’t even put God first
You’re the only reason that I sleep so often
I'm hurting nights I don’t see you
I just keep on tossing and turning
I feel so lost and deserted, you made my life good
I told you if I had to take a bullet for you, I would
So baby here I go with the proof, this is it
The moment of truth, only for you *gunshot*

Where are you? Are you only in my dreams?
I don’t wanna wake up
I’ll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I’m really hoping to find you
I don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up I’ll stay asleep
I don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up I’ll stay asleep42Embed
