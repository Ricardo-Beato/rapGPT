19 ContributorsRamona Park Legend Pt. 2 Lyrics
I'm a muhfuckin' legend
I'm a muhfuckin' legend
That's just how a nigga feel
That's just how a nigga feel
I'm a muhfuckin'—

One hand in the air, two hands on the nine when you shoot
I'm a muhfuckin' legend
When I die, build a shrine on my side of the town, if it's cool
It's so hard, trying not to go so hard
It's so hard, trying not to go so hard

I'm a muhfuckin' legend
I'm a muhfuckin' legend
I'm a muhfuckin' legend

One hand in the air, two hands on the nine when you shoot
When I die, build a shrine on my side of the town if it's cool
It's so hard, trying not to go so hard
It's so hard, trying not to go so hard
I'm a muhfuckin'—
I'm a muhfuckin'—You might also like6Embed
