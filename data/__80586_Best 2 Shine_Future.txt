20 ContributorsBest 2 Shine Lyrics
I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch, then they follow my lead
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off

I took the profit from the coke and slapped it right on my feet
I tried to hide a half a million cash, it took me some weeks
Man, that bitch got some head so good, you gon' swear she ain't got no teeth
I mixed the molly with the lean, now we laid up in a suite
I'm in the hood posted up, I know the police gon' sweep
I keep a hood ho, so I can keep that dough where she sleep
She down for a nigga and she ride with that four-fifth
I put that AK in her name, but I keep it on me
I'm brand new when I step out from my head to my feet
These niggas studying my photos, trying their best to compete
I got a style so outrageous, I come through like a chief
I'm the commander on these streets, all you niggas know me

I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch, then they follow my lead
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off

I put Versace on my denim, I'm a lion at heart
I was selling dope like every day 'til I topped the charts
I serve my same clientele, cause these cars are unmarked
I'm running up to every car before the car even parks
We went from Reebok and Girbauds, now it's Louis Vuitton
You want to be Future, I'll look at you just like you're my son
I got a rap check and all I hang around is ex-cons
And if I ever get in trouble, my bitch gon' pay my bond
I told that bitch I need a yopper and she went to the pawn
And I didn't have to tell her twice, cause it was already done
These niggas showing out for me, so now they ordering up ones
Been on some futuristic shit, now I'm back where I begun

I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch, then they follow my lead
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off

Put the codeine in the Sprite, and then I'll have me a drank
Smelling like a pound of loud when I step in the bank
Future razor blade sharp, in the club with my shank
I'm on my rock star campaign, and I'm cool as you think
You need to turn it to the max if you want to turn up
You brought your girl to the club, but she's leaving with us
I'm mashing off in the coupe, getting some head from a slut
And she's catching everything, she won't spit it back up
I bought that bitch some red bottoms, cause she's down for the kid
And she owns so many guns, she's worse than Billy the Kid
I put that semi-automatic in her name and she's with it
When you pull up with that cash, she's going to serve you them fishes
I got a bitch stay in the hood with a whole quarter key
Put that choppa in her name and keep it right on the seat
Man, these niggas say they fly, but they ain't fly like me
Turn it up a notch, then they follow my lead
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off
They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off1Embed
