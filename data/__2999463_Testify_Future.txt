So I'm the bad guy, huh, so you supposed to be the good girl
Huh, okay
Super
Either way it go, either way it go (Either way it go, nigga, ball, ball)

So you wanna fall for the bad guy?
So you wanna fall, gettin' mad high?
Confess your love for me, testify
Anytime I'm with you, gotta testify
Anything we go through is a test of times
Can you be the one who love me all the time?
We not doing good, you can see the signs
Can you do the crime like it's Bonnie and Clyde?

I'm giving you my testimony line for line
I'm giving you the best of me, it's wrong or right
Somebody tell the kids they need to calm it down
I wanna hear your heart pump pound for pound
Show me everything I need to see on my blind side
Show me you gon' be there for the love of a real boy
I just wanna be there for my dogs, they need me
I just wanna be there for the game, that's easy
Crumble up some herb, we ain't gettin' no Z-Zs
Connoisseurs of purp, gotta give 'em a repeat
Turbo, sixty seconds in a Porsche on a one way
Amigos down in Texas, we gon' get us some grande
Cherish every minute, every second we vibe, baby
I wanna be confident when I say you my lady
I wanna be arrogant when I say you mine, baby
I know I embarrass you, I typically violate it
You might also like
So you wanna fall for the bad guy?
So you wanna fall, gettin' mad high?
Confess your love for me, testify
Anytime I'm with you, gotta testify
Anything we go through is a test of times
Can you be the one who love me all the time?
We not doing good, you can see the signs
Can you do the crime like it's Bonnie and Clyde?

A lil' turbulence got you mad curious
I could've been, but I made a jugg again
Parking lot dealership, I'm in to win
We can't fake the flaws, we can't do pretend
Can you keep it solid and don't ever bend?
We gon' need colossal, we gon' need colossal
Hold me down, down, down like a real shotta
We conversin' back and forth like we real partners
Spiritually, we bonded through the turmoil
I try my best to treasure, give a little more
I know you need my time, 'cause there's gwala comin'
I know you seen the wave comin' and you start runnin'
Don't you be afraid, I'ma guard you with my life
You listen to these blogs, they gon' tell you I ainâ€™t right
Listen to your heart and we gon' ride for life
Shorty on the squad, she gon' ride for life (Free Bandz!)
So you wanna fall for the bad guy?
So you wanna fall, gettin' mad high?
Confess your love for me, testify
Anytime I'm with you, gotta testify
Anything we go through is a test of times
Can you be the one who love me all the time?
We not doing good, you can see the signs
Can you do the crime like it's Bonnie and Clyde?

Confess your love for me, testify
Confess your love for me, testify9Embed
