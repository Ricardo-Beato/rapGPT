Straight up, fuck y'all—

Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles (Young Money)
Pop— Poppin' them bottles, pop— poppin' them bottles
Now, ever since I could remember, I been smokin' that 'dro
(Shout-out my nigga Willie the Kid! Shout-out The Replacements! AMG!)
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand (Dr— Dramatic, nigga! Dramatic!)
Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles (My niggas up next! Yeah)
Pop— Poppin' them bottles, pop— poppin' them bottles (Young Money! Oww!)
Now, ever since I could remember, I been smokin' that 'dro (Cash Money, haha! Mr. Game Seven!)
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand (Weezy, talk to 'em! Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

When it comes to the bread, I got the keys to the bakery
These niggas out 'chere trippin', sellin' keys to them agencies
My bitch keep saying that the judge got a date for me
I tell a silly bitch and your honor they can wait for me
I'm gone in the coupe with the roof steady chasing me
Shine so hard, like the fucking sun facing me—basically
Take it how you take it, I be making you be hating me
Loving me, but hating me; ho, you got to pay for me
Riding in the big boys, sitting on them grown folks
Every time I park, it's a motherfucking car show
I guess I'm the number-one Lakers fan
Yellow bottle, yellow bottle; purple bag, purple bag
You might also like
Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles
Pop— Poppin' them bottles, pop— poppin' them bottles
Now, ever since I could remember, I been smokin' that 'dro
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand
Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles
Pop— Poppin' them bottles, pop— poppin' them bottles (Yeah)
Now, ever since I could remember (Ahem), I been smokin' that 'dro (Yeah)
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand (Yeah! Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

Well, they know me as lil' Curren$y, but some call me "The Hot Spitta"
Sittin' in the Chevy on three wheels, like a tricycle
Always been a fly nigga since I was a little one
Bottle-pop like the NBA Finals is what we won (Yeah)
I puff a lot of blunts (Yeah) with my nigga, Weezy B
One night, I was so high, I thought that I forgot how to read
Young Money fly boys, mami—weed a different breed
Throwing parties at secret locations somewhere on the beach
We off in Privé, Patrón shots for the models
And send a bottle of that Cris' up to the DJ
I live by these rules only: money over bitches (Ha)
And it been like that ever since I could remember

Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles
Pop— Poppin' them bottles, pop— poppin' them bottles
Now, ever since I could remember, I been smokin' that 'dro
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand
Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles
Pop— Poppin' them bottles (Hey), pop— poppin' them bottles (Hey)
Now, ever since I could remember (Hey), I been smokin' that 'dro (Bitch, I'm Mack Maine!)
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand (Hey, hey, ayy)
I just copped me some purp' (Purp'), I'm 'bout to open up (Chyeah)
I put my heart in my prices—see, I'ma show you love
See, I front you an ounce—to get you started, clown (Yeah)
And you ain't got to go to Mickey-D's for quarter-pounds (Ugh)
I be in A-Town, livin' la vida, la loca (Yeah)
Throwin' that money on cho'cha (Yeah), spendin' a stack up in Strokers (Chyeah)
Yes, I'm a ani-mal (Ani-mal); to be frank, I'm a dog
If it's that time of the month, baby-girl, I need some skull (Bitch!)
Some mouth-and-lip service—that'd be perfect
You saw the rims on the Benz, and you got nervous (Ugh)
But I'm a G—yep! I pop my collar (Ugh), hop in Impalas (Ugh)
Ride for the dollars (Ugh), hit the club (Ugh)
Go straight to the bar (Ugh), and pop my bottles (Ugh)

Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles
Pop— Poppin' them bottles, pop— poppin' them bottles
Now, ever since I could remember, I been smokin' that 'dro
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand
Now, ever since I could remember, I been poppin' them bottles
Pop— Poppin' them bottles, pop— poppin' them bottles
Now, ever since I could remember, I been smokin' that 'dro
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand, in my hand

Young Money!
Big shout to Alexis Motors!
My nigga, Troy—what up, Carlo?4Embed
