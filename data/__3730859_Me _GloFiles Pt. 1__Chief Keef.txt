6 ContributorsMe (GloFiles Pt. 1) Lyrics
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Sosa baby, GBE baby

I be smokin' tree, I be spendin' Gs
Who I see? I
Who do you want to be? Me
Your bitch love, me, wanna fuck, me
I ain't gotta get her high, she wanna drug me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who be smokin' dope?
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who be stackin' dough?
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who be packin' heat?
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who brought an act of lean?
Me, me, me, me

That lil' ass dope you smokin' on
That lil' ass pour you holdin' on
Wait, where they do that at?
Tell me what is goin' on
Them lil' ass racks you holdin' on
That cheap ass hat you throwin' on
That lil' ass drank you pourin' out
I bring pints and foreigns out
You son of a bitches got me to get ignant (me)
But sons of Anarchy, IÂ´m so committed (me)
Broad day, broad wait
I'm so damn wicked (me)
Treat your bitch like a posted
I gotta stick it (me)
You might also like
Catch a fuck nigga, in traffic
Run 'em down, catch his bitch ass
Tie him up, sat him down
Take his fucking ice, piece him up
Melt it down (me)
Chop his fingers up
To his family, mail it down (me)

I be smokin' tree, I be spendin' Gs
Who I see? I
Who do you want to be? Me
Your bitch love, me, wanna fuck, me
I ain't gotta get her high, she wanna drug me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who be smokin' dope?
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who be stackin' dough?
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who be packin' heat?
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who brought an act of lean?
Me, me, me, me

Pour a 12 in the Sprite
Give it a sun kiss
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Cus' I love this
With this racks bitch I buy it If I touched it
You can call it a nigga's bitch cus' I fucked it
I keep necessary unnecessary commas (me)
All this light on me like the end of the tunnel (me)
And bitch I got the belly of a bagel (me)
I'm makin' cold in the sauna
I keep the 40 in my waist like it's trash (me)
Touch the money, ay, I treat it like a dash (me)
Ben Franklin, he treat me like I'm his dad (me)
My jewelry water but I treat it like it's glass (me)
I be smokin' tree, I be spendin' Gs
Who I see? I
Who do you want to be? Me
Your bitch love, me, wanna fuck, me
I ain't gotta get her high, she wanna drug me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who be smokin' dope?
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who be stackin' dough?
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who be packin' heat?
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Who brought an act of lean?
Me, me, me, meEmbed
