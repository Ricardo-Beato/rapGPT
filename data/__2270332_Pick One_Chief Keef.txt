21 ContributorsPick One Lyrics

Remember posted on the block ready for the war
Running up in houses, straight kickin doors
Posted on the front right on Grenshaw
On Indiana toting big guns
When I come through, Hut! attention
Niggas full of hate they full of tension
Come through with the chopper you can call me Sosa 10 guns
Dead or in jail nigga pick one

Your drawers got lint on it, talking money I been on ya
Don't make me up this fif on ya, give your ass a 51
I be smoking 91, you be smokin' 61
You don't even smoke that 87, you be smokin' that shitty stuff
I be smoking that 93, think I was born in 93
Ben Frank said he was having dinner, he called me and invited me
Cops got pictures of me selling dope, they call me and indicted me
I donâ€™t even like to talk but my money it like to speak
You got 15 for a V shit that's aight with me
But I gotta call you back cause your first price was beat
On the block it was me, white, pipes and weed
Let an opp pull up, I'ma get the strikey things

Running up a house and straight kick in door
Posted on the front right on Grenshaw
On Indian toting big guns
When I come through, Hut! attention
Niggas full of hate they full of tension
Come through with the chopper you can call me Sosa 10 guns
Dead or in jail nigga pick one

Dead or in jail nigga pick one
Heaven or in hell a nigga in one
I don't play ball I cross the AND1
Shot the 3s, we street ballers, dunk a damn point
I'm rolling up backwoods fuck your damn joint
I don't like them swishers they don't feel right
You feel like ballin', feel like stallin', what you feel like
I ain't can't get right, I'm Mr. Get Right
I'm riding with that missile I won't miss you, I'm gonna hit you
Wassup to the bay, wassup South Central
Wassup to L.A, I'm some Chiraq ass nigga
I still be in my ways, I be totin' my pistol

Remember posted on the block ready for the war
Running up a house and straight kick in door
Posted on the front right on Grenshaw
On Indian toting big guns
When I come through, Hut! attention
Niggas full of hate they full of tension
Come through with the chopper you can call me Sosa 10 guns
Dead or in jail nigga pick one3Embed
