88 ContributorsZombies Lyrics
(That's right)
(That's right)

All I see is zombies
Walking all around us
You can hear them coming
(They come to take your life)
You can hear them breathing
Breathing down your spine, oh
All I see is zombies
Hear them screaming louder
They can smell your money
And they want your soul
Here they come behind you
Try to stay alive

We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
You will find there is no safe place to hide, hide

(That's right, that's right)
That's right, that's right
You might also like
All I see is zombies
Feeding all around us
All they eat are people
(And you won't survive)
They don't know what happened
They just stay alive

We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
There is no way to stop it
You will find there is no safe place to hide

(That's right, that's right)

We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
There is no way to stop it
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Do you feel alive?18Embed
