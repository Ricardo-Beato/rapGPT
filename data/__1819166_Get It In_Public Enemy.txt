3 ContributorsGet It In Lyrics
Get it in
Gots to get it in
I got to get it in
Gots to get in
Got to get it in

Heavy mental, artist instrumental
Ghetto metal, I said it 'cause I don't settle
My pen's the ride, on the pad, the road
Y'all must've known this is the way I unwind and unload
Over beats, overload, mind explodes
Stress in this depression, new ghosts of Tom Joad
New dust bowl blues, back to fake jewels
So I drop jewels to inform the fooled
Clock tickin' three songs a day like its food
Carry on, I am that ramblin' man dude
Updated, I was born to deliver car songs
D still drives a Caddy, I'll mess with a Dord
Now songs are blood and songs are swords
Everybody should be able to afford
Home, food, and a job to work
We the people gettin' robbed by these corporate jerks
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the people hitchhiking the turnpike
Y'all know that ain't right, so I gotta get it in tonight
I gotta get it in tonight
You might also like
Bump Knucks in the house and I came to (get it in)
Rock rock with the best of the best and I'm (get it in)
Touch mics, I a beast when I (get it in, get it in)
Yeah, word, throw your hands up (get it in)
When there's war for the cause, of course I gotta (get it in)
On the blaze on the mic, you know I gotta (get it in)
When PE calls a fight, so watch me (get it in)
Word, lets rock, word yo

I always wanted to be an S1
March my dance steps and carry two guns
Cause I'm a rider for the Strong Island
Wilin', stylin', 98 crew retirin' salute
For the culture I'll shoot, ha, boom bap at you
I'm nice, Chuck bars go too
We embargo too, we prohibit wack rappers to move
Ha, or we'll stomp on you
Throw your hands up, five fingers, close your fist
Then repeat after me and it goes like this
Come on, get it in (word), the rhymes are sick
This info in flow wherever it ends up
Copyright law that will leave you a sloppy right jaw
Hard as I work to write more
So Flavor Flav, if you're ready to win
Why don'tcha get on the mic and get it in, get it in?
In order to reach status like us you gotta (Get it in)
Public Enemy Number One, baby, yo we (Get it in)
Chuck D is the hard rhymer, yo, because he (Get it in)
Flavor Flav, he (Get it in)
Riding on the block, you gotta (Get it in)
In the Bronx, we rock the block, you gotta (Get it in)
Nassau county on the rock, you gotta (Get it in)
When you got to do your time, you gotta (Get it in)
In Rikers C-76, I had to (Get it in)
On the streets in a fight, I had to (Get it in)
Running from the cops, I had to (Get it in)
I was fighting with my girl, I had to (Get it in)
It was me against the world, I gotta (Get it in)
I'm in a high speed chase, I gotta (Get it in)
I got the cops on my case, I gotta (Get it in)
I got the IRS all after me, yo, I gotta (Get it in)
I got the Feds after me, yo, I gotta (Get it in)
I got my girl after me, yo, I gotta (Get it in)
When the boys is after you, yo, better (Get it in)
If you in a gang fight, yo, you better (Get it in)
When you go to jail, you got no choice but to (Get it in)
If he bend you over, you know he gonna (Get it in)Embed
