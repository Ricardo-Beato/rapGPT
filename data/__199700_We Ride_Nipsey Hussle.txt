5 ContributorsWe Ride Lyrics
Just on this marathon, now there ain't nothing more to say, bruh...
Lemme hit you right back
Hussle
One take

Aye, look
Tatoo's on my faces
Cause i beat all my cases
Finally off probation, but im not on vacation
I'm young, I'm rich, I'm famous
Your bitch is amazing
She came through and fucked me good and told me not to say shit
Oops, lil ma, that's my bad
Filmed you on my iPad
Showed all of my bro-bro's
That big screen, your fine ass
I fucked her til she climaxed
That bedboard, she palm that
Turned around, threw it back
So i went deep inside that
Look... X-rated, highly anticipated
Drunk as fuck, I'm smokin' blunts, she's puffin' papers
Get pussy from these bitches. This shit is just like a layup
 just on this marathon, now it ain't nothin more to say but
"The more you pursue her, acting crazy, looking stupid
The more she's fallin' for this young nigga chasin' gouda"
Bulletproof black on black, I'm blowing circles out the roof uh (uh)
Just smokin' to this music like, like...

And we ride
Seat back, top down, music bangin', hands in the sky
And we Ride
Top off, seat back, music playin', blood shot eyes
And we Ride
Seat back, top off, music bangin', baby lookin' fly
And we ride
Top off, seat back, music playin', when ?Embed
