Ooh
And we live
And we recording
And there's lean on deck, you know?
Purple Rain
Okay, so, yeah

I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait (Uh), I'ma be fine

I said hold on, bro wait (Uh), I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait (Uh), I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait (Uh), I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait (Uh), I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine (Uh), I'ma be fine

But in the meantime, bitch, it's lean time
Pop a bean time 'cause it ain't killing me
My lil' bro keep a .40, they thought his ass was security
Too busy making money to worry 'bout making memories
But in the meantime, bitch, it's green time
Maybe lean time, outta energy
My momma told me, "Stop the painkillers"
Them shits is killing me (Killing me, killing me), I'ma be fine (Huh)

I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine (Uh), I'ma be fine

They know my name hold weight (Uh)
Put it in her mouth just like Colgate (Uh)
Get outta line and you get punched in your face
Shouldn't have been around here in the first place
Now you got a black eye
I got mob ties, I got gang ties
Make you drown in your blood, just like high tide
Now I'm up, everybody wanna high five
Remember when they used to diss me in the lunch line
Now I'm eating steak and eggs when it's lunchtime
I remember eating Ramen with a Glock 9
I remember when she left me for the next guy
Now she calling me her next guy (Huh)

I woke up Xanning
I sit down, I can't stand it anymore (Anymore)
Can't stand it anymore (Anymore, anymore, ooh, ooh)
I woke up leaning, so I woke up dreaming (Dreaming)
And fiending for more, for more, for more
One cup, I need four more, hey
I woke up leaning, so I woke up dreaming (Dreaming)
And fiending for more, for more, for more
One cup, I need four more, hey (Hey, hey, hey, hey)58Embed
