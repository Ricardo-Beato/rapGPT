Two of them, two keys
Too breeze, too easy
Too breeze, too easy
Too breeze, too easy (Yeah)

Remember at the dawn, waiting for my whole life (Yeah)
Doing all that producing at midnight (Yeah)
Living on utter bliss, nothing but no mind (Yeah)
Turn around to leave nothing but new light (Yeah)

I ain't even gonna love me
I needed you to love me
Love me
