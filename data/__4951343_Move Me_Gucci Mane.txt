12 ContributorsMove Me Lyrics
I'm a real street nigga, I don't see it that way (Nah)
I bought a Rolls Royce, 'cause bitch, I want my roses today (Yeah)
Y'all been hidin' from the truth, but you gon' listen today (You gon' listen today)
I'm the head coach, so know what position to play (Huh)
Gas bag shawty, yeah, I gotta fly to the Bay
Knock the meat out your rib, I got tape on the K
She a goddess of the trap, angel white like the yay (Angel)
She so motherfuckin' thick, you let her know where you stay (Woo)
Like a cartoon, lil' bitch took a pie to the face
Ice Cube, cold game, it's one hell of a day
She got a real pretty face, you like, "Where is her waist?" (Where?)
Took that bitch to the place and she like, "Where is the safe?" (Huh?)

Looking in my pockets, it's filled with blue hundreds (Blue)
Don't nothing move me but the goddamn money
Drop a bag, make the room clear, run, run, dear (Run)
The stick long as a broom, it can kill a reindeer (Yeah)
Before you came here we was sellin' 'caine here (Skrrt)
Since Gucci Mane left, it just not the same here (Nah)
Then I make a false step 'cause he yellin', "Help, help" (Help)
Wet him up like Mike Phelps, dead in seatbelt (Belt)

Gambling with the trap god, better not welch (Welch)
He brought it on his own self, he caused his own death (Graow)
Tryna make a death threat with a weak rep (Huh?)
Uphill battle, runnin' up some steep steps (Wop)
Ballers on the right (Right), haters on the left (Left)
Money make these bitches can't keep they hands to they self (Well, damn)
Way this money comin' in, shit, I'ma need some help (Help)
East Atlanta Santa and y'all all Santa elves (Ho)
Buckin', used to pull it, nigga, I was just 12 (Huh?)
You still ain't got no straightening, nigga, you just took an L (Sack)
If I do a feature, it's gon' cost like fifty bales (Fifty)
I need an endorsement, I'm the poster boy for scales (Skrrt)
Took a million risks, I took the train, I took the mail
Most you niggas shell, I sell water to a whale (Shell)
Tried to break me in the cell, I'm too strong, I still prevail
Smoke one for Aaliyah, nigga, turn this up a lil' (Wop)
You might also like
Looking in my pockets, it's filled with blue hundreds (Blue)
Don't nothing move me but the goddamn money
Drop a bag, make the room clear, run, run, dear (Run)
The stick long as a broom, it can kill a reindeer (Yeah)
Before you came here we was sellin' 'caine here (Skrrt)
Since Gucci Mane left, it just not the same here (Nah)
Then I make a false step 'cause he yellin', "Help, help" (Help)
Wet him up like Mike Phelps, dead in seatbelt (Belt)Embed
