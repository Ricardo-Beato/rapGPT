11 ContributorsIâ€™m Human Lyrics
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!

A queen is not a queen because she has failed
But a queen is a queen because failure has not stopped her
Take it from me, the queen of all queens
Women are taking over for the new millennium, haw!
What the hell do you want from me?
I'm just tryna be all that I can be
I'm a god damn legacy
Thanks to B.I.G. and Puff Daddy
The first lady runs the world now
They impeached the president from his residence
No one drops bombs 'til I say so
One, two, one, two, three, go!

I'm human, you're human
So they say but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they say but inside we're all animals

How dare you accuse me and my family
You fucking clones, leave us alone!
Me and Puff is like Janet and Mike
You make us wanna (scream), know what I mean?
(Yeah, yeah) I know y'all rather see us dead
No more platinum plaques certified lead
We got too many chips for y'all
Queen Bee, Queen Bee make hits for y'all
Take a deep breath
Inhale, exhale 'til there's no more left
In the name of the father, son, and daughter
Here comes the new world order!
You can't stop it
Mother Earth this my universe
When worse comes to worst (uh huh)
I call the shots (uh huh), stack all the knots (uh huh)
Pack all the Glocks, take the safety off lock, fire!
You might also like
I'm human, you're human
So they say but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they say but inside we're all animals

Ah, la-la-lah
That la-lah, la-lah (sing!)
Ah, la-la-lah
That la-lah, la-lah (huh, huh!)
Ah, la-la-lah
That la-lah, la-lah
We love that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah!

Can I jingle it, baby? Go 'head, baby
Can I jingle it, baby? Go 'head, baby (hmm)
Take it out, let me sit on it
You can't make it wet, you spit on it
Ah don't stop 'til it rise to the top
Promise you won't drop 'til the cherry go (pop)
And if it doesn't fit then use your lips
Oh, here it comes, what's my name? Queen Bitch!

I'm human, you're human
So they say but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they say but inside we're all animals
Ah, la-la-lah
That la-lah, la-lah (sing!)
Ah, la-la-lah
That la-lah, la-lah (huh, huh!)
Ah, la-la-lah
That la-lah, la-lah
We love that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah!Embed
