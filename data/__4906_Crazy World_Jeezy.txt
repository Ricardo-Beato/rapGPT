15 ContributorsCrazy World Lyrics
Yeah, y'all better vote for Barrack O' Drama
A black president and shit, nigga
Oh, oh this shit fucked up right here, nigga
Ain't no work, ain't no jobs, yeah we still got bills tho nigga
Best believe nigga, but through it all what they want hommie, yeah?
They want that young shit, that dumb shit, that, where you from shit?
That ride around your hood all day with your gun shit
All I got to my name is two bricks and one felony
You going back to jail, that's what my conscience keep on telling me
I really ain't buying all that bullshit they selling me
When the government throwing more curves than the letter C
I said the letter C, I guess that's for correctional
They tryin' to box me in, sit me still like a vegetable
Goddamn, another trap, I think Bush is tryin' punish us
Sendin' a little message out to each and everyone of us
Real G shit, boy that's really unheard of
When you get more time for sellin' dope than murder
(In this crazy world)

This world keep spinnin', yeah my rims still spinnin'
Even though the money slow we still spinnin' (in this crazy world)
As this world keep turnin', yeah, my blunt still burnin'
Same thing different day, it's still burnin' (in this crazy world)
See this dope still selling and these niggas still tellin'
Will you make it through the day? It's no tellin' (in this crazy world)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, (in this crazy world)

When I as 14 I turned nothin' to a quarter mil
Probably why I never give a fuck about a record deal
And I ain't never tried this shit, imagine how that white feel
But that don't even matter though, tryin' to pay the light bill
Light bill, phone bill plus my granny nerve pills
Feel like I should be takin' them, imagine how my nerves feel
I want a new Bentley and my auntie need a kidney
And if I let her pass her children never will forgive me
Goddamn, another trap, I think Bush is tryin' punish us
Sendin' a little message out to each and everyone of us
Real G shit, boy that's really unheard of
When you get more time for sellin' dope than murder
(In this crazy world)

This world keep spinnin', yeah my rims still spinnin'
Even though the money slow we still spinnin' (in this crazy world)
As this world keep turnin', yeah, my blunt still burnin'
Same thing different day, it's still burnin' (in this crazy world)
See this dope still selling and these niggas still tellin'
Will you make it through the day? It's no tellin' (in this crazy world)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, (in this crazy world)

I ain't an X-Box, so why you niggas tryin' play with me?
I really beat the streets so what you niggas gotta say to me?
Can't be much, can't be much, why? Cause I ain't listenin'
I just left the hood and I'll be damned if they ain't feelin' 'em
Wanna see me fall off, guess that just the way it be
Old school triple beam, I'm using that the way I'm being
And plus I got driver that can get them thangs from A to B
Soon as you get your money right, they hit you with conspiracy
Goddamn, another trap, I think Bush is tryin' punish us
Sendin' a little message out to each and everyone of us
Real G shit, boy, that's really unheard of
When you get more time for sellin' dope than murder
(In this crazy world)
This world keep spinnin', yeah my rims still spinnin'
Even though the money slow we still spinnin' (in this crazy world)
As this world keep turnin', yeah, my blunt still burnin'
Same thing different day, it's still burnin' (in this crazy world)
See this dope still selling and these niggas still tellin'
Will you make it through the day? It's no tellin' (in this crazy world)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, (in this crazy world)

That's what I said nigga, I said yeah
We can't even pay our bills around this motherfucker
You niggas stealin' and building condos and shit nigga
You know, damn, here goes another
They just built another one, nigga
Y'all don't see it, though I say it, for real dawg
We're still fucked up by this misconception nigga
Ain't nothin' movin' nigga, nothin'Embed
