38 ContributorsN.I.G.G.A.  Lyrics
Niggas
Yeah, uh
Niggas

Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice, no peace
Fuck the law, rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine, cross the line
My two .9s go "Bayah, bayah" when I shoot 'em
Korean motherfuckers was crooked. so niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night, my niggas (Niggas)
Uh, straight take his life
So don't sleep when my team creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip, 'cause we did 'em
Lickin' off shots for Latasha, that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now?
I packed a .9 last year, in '99, I'm packin' two now
And even if they pull they triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothin's gonna stop the plan of true niggas

Niggas
Yeah, niggas, can't fuck with us
Niggas
Yeah, niggas
'Cause bein' a nigga means you love niggas, haha
Niggas
I was raised in this society so there's no way you can
Expect me to be a perfect person, 'cause I'ma do what I'ma do
Jada (Uh, ayo)
You might also like
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em Bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is headshots
Your last words'll be, "Damn, what's all these red dots?"
Niggas nowadays, they worry me
My bars is therapy, as long as you usin' 'em thoroughly
Mwah, 'til the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably ever be
And I'm a product of the '70s
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eating wit' you, I'm probably beefin' wit' you
If no money ain't involved, ain't no need for me speaking wit' you
I know you got a gun but I'm hopin' you keep it wit' you
'Cause, unfortunately, I'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol
And know what the llama do
Shady, Aftermath, Ruff Ryders, D Block, and, of course Amaru
Lot of people honor you
Probably 'cause the way that you used to bring the drama to
Whoever you wanted to
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But, anyway, life goes on
So I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do

Niggas
Yeah, niggas, can't fuck with us
Niggas
Yeah, niggas
'Cause bein' a nigga means you love niggas, haha
Niggas
I was raised in this society so there's no way you can
Expect me to be a perfect person, 'cause I'ma do what I'ma do
Niggas
Nigga, can't fuck with us8Embed
