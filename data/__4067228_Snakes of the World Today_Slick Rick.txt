4 ContributorsSnakes of the World Today LyricsOkay, low-lives, let's start the war
When I'm through with you  I'll have you keelin' on the floor
You sayin' every curve has a story to tell
You say you put my son under some magical spell
You say you'll take my lady, freak, that's only because
When I look at the monster, I say, "He can be yours"
He's a dog, you're a snake
Two cobras for ya
Left over little hotties with not under desire
So, where's the crown for the great snake conqueror?
A slap across the face to show how much of a punk you are
You wanna play? Well, I carry a tray
Let's call it self-defense if I blow you away
You (Snakes of the world today)
You (Snakes of the world today)
Oh, so now you're gonna front like you are one man
I'll beat you down, 'cause they might lie and play me like I'm a fan
Blood-suckers, I'm healin' that it's not on your side
But, honey, word's out, and your man's a duck
From freeload city, he ain't worth a damn
Tryna come out on the scene tip like that-
Yes, you, little girl
More familiar faces
Don't play brave or you'll need more than 
So, snakes unite
Respect you'll never get
You sold your innocence to a royalty check
And my words are true and they hold no mystery
It's written in the past and you cannot change history

(Snakes of the world today)
So, you want me to bow
Well, I'm sorry, Your Highness
Payback is a witch for your undeserving kindness
Your claim-to-fame is now properly over
So straighten up your life or go join Jehovah
Bricks through knives, thug's a played out user
Countin' up your joints just like another loser
All you snakes, whassup
You think we're playin'
Your mic styles weak like the man L was sayin'
So, cheerio, stream or vote, it was fun while it lasted
Yo, love's not the message for you, you white bastard
Yes we're supposed to play that we carry a tray
We'll call it self-defense when we blow you away
You (Snakes of the world today)
