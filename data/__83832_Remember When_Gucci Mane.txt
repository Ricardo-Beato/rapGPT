11 ContributorsRemember When Lyrics
Do you remember when I met you girl everything was alright
Do you remember when we got a room we was fucking all night
Do you remember the time, girl?
Like I remember the time, girl

Girl you my type, you just right
That blouse on you fit just right
Them jeans she got on skin-tight
She sexy, cool, but still shy
I'm colder than a Klondike
My polar I got dumb ice
We know each other, we go together
Like hamburgers and french fries
Everything is alright
We'll never have a fist fight
But last night had a sex fight
Then told her have a blessed night
I'm leanin', I'm meanin'
I fall asleep might have dreams in it
Hit the club and bring my team in it
Not tonight, I'mma bring my queen in it
I go get it, you bullshitters
I hit it, damn right that kid did it
You hood critics and hood chickens
Please try to stay out my business
From south France to south Philly
ATL to North Memphis
From my city, to your city
Think you got more swag but not really
You might also like
Do you remember when I met you girl everything was alright
Do you remember when we got a room we was fucking all night
Do you remember the time, girl?
Like I remember the time, girl

I'mma put it down
So Gucci gon' wake up so
I run it it's gon' hurt
But when I'm gone it'll make you want mo'
Scented oils and candles
I pull up in my Lambo
The bestest that you never had
Two backstreets off the main road
You had her but she left so
That's just the way the game go
No one on my level so get up out my lane ho
I met a girl so real that it's no need to run no game on
Reminisce of Gucci every time they play my same song
I'm on her like a long john
Short skirt with no thongs on
Sexy naked sunbathin' outside my house with frames on
I took her for some buster and that boy ain't gon' do shit about it
It's alright if we kick it, tell that sucker forget about it
Do you remember when I met you girl everything was alright
Do you remember when we got a room we was fucking all night
Do you remember the time, girl?
Like I remember the time, girl

Girls to my right, ladies to my left
The weather's real hot, snow on my chest
And I see this fly girl, tried to get her number
Then she tells me that I already smashed last summer (remember?)
Mile high club, G5 planes
Remember back rubs and pink champagne
Mile high club, G5 planes
Remember back rubs and pink champagne

Do you remember when I met you girl everything was alright
Do you remember when we got a room we was fucking all night
Do you remember the time, girl?
Like I remember the time, girlEmbed
