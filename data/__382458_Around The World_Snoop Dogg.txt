4 ContributorsAround The World Lyrics
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world

Catch us in M.I.A
Cleveland and Dallas
We be European, D-P-Gin' in malice
Roll up the best dro, we here now
Turn up, when you get down
Roll call, all my dogs, spent 10 g's at the strip mall

Round and round we go
Where we stop, no-one will know
Baby it's  Austria, Beli,  Tokyo
Then I, spin the globe, putting my fingers on it
Like a G-6, pop a flight then I'm 'in on it
Then I zoom straight to , UK, Belgium, then back to France


It was all on you, now it's all on me
All around the world, this is volume three
Me and my cousin, D-a-z
Ain't too many spots that we don't be
Mad when I play us
Cute lil' Egyptian, met her in Arabia
Mad when a nigga stop paging her
I had to let her know, I ain't saving ya
You might also like
You know, we know the flight's 
Strap it/traffic, ten s with the flyest beach
In Dubai, you know we don't  smoking, we high
And then we fly over to the states with the cars we drive
And then we end up at the leopard nine
This guy gon' party like all day long
Who gon' tell him when we end up next?
    beach cmon


All around the world babe
People say the same things
People say they on they own
But they do the same thing
All around the world mayne
Everything's the same game
People say they on they own
But they do the same thing
