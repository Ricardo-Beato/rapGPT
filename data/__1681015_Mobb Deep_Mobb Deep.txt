Yup, you know what it is, the people's choice DJ Envy
Got Prodigy on the line
Prodigy, what it is?
Yeah, what's poppin' yo?
What's poppin', kid?
How's everything?
Everything's good, man
You know I'm holdin' it down
You holdin' up everything good?
Yeah, yeah, you know, hangin' in there, doin' what I gotta do
Aight, now we gotta talk about you bloggin' in-in jail
Now, how are you online bloggin', P?
Like, how was that possible?
I mean, basically, I just send the letters home, know what I'm sayin'?
Then my wife does it
Oh, oh-oh, so wifey's helpin' along
Yeah, you know what I mean?
I write it out
So-so wifey's the fingers and you just the mind?
Yeah, basically, I write it out and mail it to her
And she get it up online
Now, the blog before you went in, you were talkin' about a lot of different artists and how you really felt about them
And, uh, recently Max B had some things to say to-say about you and things like that
Now, r-rumor has it that you're kind of like Tony Soprano in prison
I mean, man, I'm just doin' me, man
No, he-he ain't nothin' like that, you know hat I'm sayin'?
Max B he-he runnin' his mouth, man
You know, I ain't put no word out or nothin' like that
Okay, 'cause-'cause Max B did hit over the head with a bottle at a club
Yeah, that happened on his own, know what I'm sayin'?
Okay
My people just took that into they own hands, know what I mean?
That-that's your story, I'm stickin' with it
I'm rockin' wit'chu, P, I'm rockin' wit-chu, totally
Word
Hehehe
Now, some of the other rappers out that, you know, had words for you and things like that, what do you say to those individuals?
I mean, I would basically say, man, you know
Just do what you do, man
Don't worry about what P's doin', man
Know what I mean?
Before you be holdin' your head like Max B
Okay, okay, okay, 'cause you'll be holdin' your head like Max B
