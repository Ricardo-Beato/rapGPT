7 ContributorsNose Red Lyrics
Damn (J. White, I need a beat I can go off on, ooh)

Beam on your nose like Rudolph
Keep a bomb on me like Eric Rudolph
Like a dog on mute, got the roof off
And like the Super Bowl, I take a nigga roof off
Got a good fight game we can duke out
A nigga touch Gucci Mane, that's a shootout
I'ma take your name off, no white out
It be a dark day in hell like a light out
You dumb as hell tryin wop, shot out
Got dummies tryna crash like Lunch pass
You a spirit from the past, you a ghost dad
You dead, I'm lock, we both sad
Put a beam on your nose like a red nose
Closed case like the casket with the red rosе
Let's get one thing hеre clear dear
This gun right here could can kill an antelope
Got a drum on it bigger than a cantaloupe
Chopper choppin' down trees like Geronimo
Fed is knocking on the door like it's Domino's
I'm at the hospital 'cause you're only comatose
Last night it was Halloween, fright night
Got 'em searching for the body with a flashlight
This double barrel here kill two deers
Crack your head like a beer, happy new yearYou might also likeEmbed
