Just for tonight, oh
Just for tonight, woo, go!

I want you (Want you, woo)
You want me (Want me)
Just for tonight (Only one night)
Just for tonight (Just for tonight), oh
I want you, baby (You)
And you want me (Me)
Just for tonight, one night
Just for tonight (One night, one night, yeah)

Look at my charm and, baby, look at my arm (Look at it, ow!)
You know you the bomb, I'ma call you Saddam (Boom)
I don't need your phone number, you comin' home (Woo)
You don't really speak no English, baby, where is you from? (Oh, go)
Never mind that, hop up in my coupe and let the top back (Skrrt)
Just a night to remember, get your recorder and rewind that (Flash, oh)
I'm surrounded by bad bitches, baby, you the finest (Oh)
Don't worry about it, it just me and you on Quavo Island (Oh)
First night, I was stylin' (Woo), I saw you smilin' (Oh)
When I leave the club on four-door, I let you be pilot (Uh)
When I get you to the room, you know that I'ma dive in (Splash)
On the first night, lil' mama goin' in (Ow! Go)
You might also like
I want you (Want you, woo)
You want me (Want me)
Just for tonight (Only one night)
Just for tonight (Just for tonight), oh
I want you, baby (You)
And you want me (Me)
Just for tonight, one night
Just for tonight (One night, one night, yeah)

I want lil' mama, lil' mama said she want young Takeoff (Takeoff, ow!)
Keep our jet private, takin' off, meet at my lake house (Pew, oh)
Takeoff ain't no Superman, ain't no need to bring that cape out (Yeah)
Givenchy my skin is, Versace my sheets when I lay down (Ow!)
I said don't touch what ain't yours, it don't belong to you (Nah)
Takin' a trip to go pick up the sack, that what we known to do (Known)
Tried to wet up my Mulsanne, but it was bulletproof (Bop-bop-bop)
With them snipers, no binoculars, we lookin' for you
Got your bitch on my line, she keep callin' me (Brrrr)
Feel like my shadow when I'm walkin', she keep stalkin' me (Hey)
Feel like she work for AT&T, keep textin' me (Uh)
Lil' bitty bitch tryna get next to me
Rubbin' all on my Jesus piece, tryna hit the weed (Go)

I want you (Want you, woo)
You want me (Want me)
Just for tonight (Only one night)
Just for tonight (Just for tonight), oh
I want you, baby (You)
And you want me (Me)
Just for tonight, one night
Just for tonight (Uh, one night, one night, Offset, yeah)
Just give me an hour (Hour), I'll be the water to your flower (Flower, woo)
I beat it, I'm killin' it (Beat it, beat it), make the pussy devour (Kill it)
Got me all in your walls (Walls, wall), I'm tryna knock down the tower (Uh)
I'm not really involved (Nah) with buyin' gifts and the flowers (Nah, no)
She see my diamond, it dancin' (I'm glossin')
I'm divin' into your water (She tossin')
She top me off (Woo), tried to kiss me (Woo)
Fuck, I done call her again, and she lost it (Woo)
It's only for one night (One night) 'cause I know that you not really worth it (One night)
If I text you tomorrow (Text you), you gon' be askin' for Birkin (Uh, uh)
Don't be involved in your feelings (In your) 'cause Offset leave bitches hurtin' (Hey, hey)
I got to use me a condom (Condom) 'cause I don't want no more gerber (Babies, uh)
I'm in the Maybach with curtains, she suck me up like a sherbert (Shew, woo)
We fuckin' these bitch with the lights on and we don't fuck under cover (Woo, nah, go)

I want you (Want you, woo)
You want me (Want me)
Just for tonight (Only one night)
Just for tonight (Just for tonight), oh
I want you, baby (You)
And you want me (Me)
Just for tonight, one night
Just for tonight (One night, one night, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh
