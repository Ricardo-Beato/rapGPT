Bad bitch get yo money, bad bitch get yo money
Bad bitch get yo money, bad bitch get yo money
Baby you deserve this cash, bad bitch get yo money
Baby you deserve this gwop, bad bitch get yo money
Bad bitch get yo money, bad bitch get yo money
Bad bitch get yo money, bad bitch get yo money
Baby gonna get that gwop, baby gonna get that money
Bad bitch get yo money, bad bitch get yo money
(Verse)
Got a bad bitch that get money
So her bag cost fifty five hunnid
Spend a cool mill on her condo so she parked her Jag in front it
75 bags she stuntin
Click of bad bitch she runnin
On Rodeo Drive call Channel 5 cause it's homicide how she stunting
Need a handicap stick cuz the car she drive, man I swear that bitch retarded
At the Heat game with them red bottoms, she go hard all night, we puntin
And I don't know what you heard bout her but my little ho getting money
Just me and her, no entourage
Bout to walk in & close down Onyx
Walk in, I'm too spiffy
Yea I got my 4-50
That corn bread, that real Jiffy
I turn yo man to a damn memory
I'm the biggest baller of this damn century
Let me refresh yo damn memory
Me and Waka Flocka, baby back to Benzes
Yall pussy ass niggas better pay attention

(Verse)
One thing I don't care about
Is asking bout another ho whereabouts
I'm caked up, no care at all
Ball so hard gotta me carry me out
I'm across the border, they bring it to me
So when I give an order better carry it out
Fuck more hoes than Wilt Chamberlain
So no ho wanna marry me now
She a bad bitch, she get real gwala
Nigga can't fuck her for $100
Got a tax service and a beauty parlor
And she go to school, she a role scholar
To a young girl she a role model
If you sick she suck the cold out ya
Ride the dick like a porn model
Catch her in the club with a gold bottle
Got old heads them old hunnids
She a young ho with old money
Too fine, too loyal
Ain't nothing that she won't do for ya
All my home boys tryna fuck
But that's just my crew for ya
And that pussy's so good
I wish there it was two of ya
