12 ContributorsWe Workin Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lil Uzi, huh?
I just tell these niggas and these bitches all the same thing
(What you tell 'em?)
‘Cause they all mortals and I'm immortal
They can't stop me, only thing they can do is watch me
And all I say is... (Tell 'em)

We workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'
We workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'
And they watchin', they watchin', they watchin', they watchin'
They watchin', they watchin', they watchin', they watchin'
And we workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'
We workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'
And they watchin', they watchin', they watchin', they watchin'
They watchin', they watchin', they watchin', they watchin'

And we workin', we workin', and these haters, they hatin'
And I'm swervin', and I'm drinkin' on that purple, words slurrin'
And I'm killin' it, and I'm feelin' it
When I'm gone off of that trippy stick
"But I thought, Vert, you ain't smoke"
Bitch, get off my dick again
‘Cause I'm making all this money, and this shit ain't nothin'
If you keep talking shit then you gon' have to deal with these repercussions
And I be just doing anything that I want ‘cause I go loco
Got yo' bitch all on my dick, bust it open for a Four Loko
I said that bitch go crazy, I said that bitch go crazy
I said that bitch be your lady, yeah, that bitch go crazy
Had to say it one more time, ‘cause I be feeling that shit
And I ain't 'bout to set trip, but I know some Blood and some Crip
Got a bitch all on my dick, rolling off the acid trip
Yeah, she sucking all on my balls, and she licking all on that tip
I'm a ratchet motherfucker, and I got a ratchet bitch
Well, she just kinda raunchy, that ass kinda chunky
And I don't fuck with the golds, bitch, I'm platinum plus
And I got yo' bitch all on me, she know that I'm a thug
And you do what you can, but a nigga do what he want
And it's that Lil Uzi Vert, but I got a pump
And I'm driving real fast, and I just got my license
And I can fuck yo' bitch, everybody know she dykin'
She sucking on the clit, she sucking everybody
And I don't give a fuck, get more head than she got bodies

We workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'
We workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'
And they watchin', they watchin', they watchin', they watchin'
They watchin', they watchin', they watchin', they watchin'
And we workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'
We workin', we workin', we workin', we workin'
And they watchin', they watchin', they watchin', they watchin'
They watchin', they watchin', they watchin', they watchin'

Eyes blurry, but focused, got that kush, pussy bitch
Yeah that shit so potent, wet just like the ocean
They say Lil Uzi Vert jet ski and I'm floatin'
Yeah, they call me, "Broski," yeah, they know I'm floatin'
When I'm in some fly shit or when I'm with a foreign bitch
Making all this money, riding in a foreign whip
Rocking all these foreign clothes, it's foreign this and foreign that
When I'm overseas, you know I'm busting all these foreign traps
Yeah, that be the plug, nigga, what you want?
I finesse and I just flex, finessin' the jugg
I could kill anything that I get on
And I could fuck any bitch when I get on
Lil niggas tote guns but don't know right from wrong
I hope I taught you something by the end of this song7Embed
