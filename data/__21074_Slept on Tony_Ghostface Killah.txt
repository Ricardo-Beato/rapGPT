11 ContributorsSlept on Tony Lyrics
Never under estimate Tony Stark

You done slept on Tony
"Tony Starks!" "Ironman!"
You done slept on Tony
"Yo, before that, I was getting it on"
You done slept on Tony
"Tony Starks!" "Ironman"
You done slept on Tony
"I was getting it, getting it, getting it on"

Yo, when they kidnapped your boy, and forced me to do evil
I created an iron suit, to protect my people
Escaped, bound to be Ironman the great
The billionaire Tony Starks'll renew your fate
Built Stark Towers, throw the biggest events
Got liquid, armor, I can paint all dents
Keep a few bad chicks, I ain't your average hero
Movie premieres, catch me wit Denzel and De Niro
Six six eleven gold, playboy industrialist
Face of a ghost, mind of a technologist
Specialist, modern day speech slang therapist
Specialize in weapons, I can blow off terrorists
So, so don't sleep big homey
Real recognize and I can see you phoneys
My weak heart can't take it, got a life long sentance
Boy genius grown up, and I fight with a vengeance
You might also like
You done slept on Tony
"Tony Starks!" "Ironman!"
You done slept on Tony
"Yo, before that, I was getting it on"
You done slept on Tony
"Tony Starks!" "Ironman"
You done slept on Tony
"I was getting it, getting it, getting it on"

Yo, I got steel toe wallies when I glide on stage
And my heart gently weeps in an iron ribcage
Punctured by metals, replaced by elements
My enemies hunt it like a tusk on the elephant
Extraordinary, hiding my dual identity
Anthony Stark, call me Ton', the top pedigree
Multi-billionaire, military contractor
Crushing my opponents, with the strength of a compactor
Ex-factor, I turn liquids to metals
Water to wine, I turn dirt into rose petals
Greatest man walking, blow a bottle of Goose
Gold-plated iron armor, to Versace suits
I'm so elegant, scientifically intelligent
My lawyers won the case, I won't take the settlement
Money's irrelevant, I need heat to energize
We taking over the planet, Stark Enterprise
You done slept on Tony
"Tony Starks!" "Ironman!"
You done slept on Tony
"Yo, before that, I was getting it on"
You done slept on Tony
"Tony Starks!" "Ironman"
You done slept on Tony
"I was getting it, getting it, getting it on"

Once again, Tony Stark, infinite finesse
Stopped the planet, and destroyed an indestructable trackEmbed
