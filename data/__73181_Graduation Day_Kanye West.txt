What in the fuck was that, Kanye?! I told you to do some shit for the kids! You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now! You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis! You will not walk 'cross that stage! You won’t slide across that stage! Motherfucker can’t pull you 'cross that muthafuckin' stage, Kanye! Who told you? See, I told you to do somethin' uplifting! I’m tryna get you out here with these white people and this how you're gon' do me? You know what, you's a nigga. And I don’t mean that in no nice way. Had lil' kids sing about the shit—y'know, the joke's on you. You throw your m**** hands in the air and wave goodbye to every-****-body! 'Cause you getting the **** out of this campus! What the f**k you gon' do now?
I'm no longer confused, but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules, but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school, so don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me, so don't tell anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job, just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybodyYou might also like23Embed
