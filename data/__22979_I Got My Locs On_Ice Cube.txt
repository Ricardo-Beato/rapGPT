I got my locs on (2x)
And you can't see my eyes (2x)
I got my locs on (2x)
And you can't tell I'm high (2x)
I got my locs on (2x)
And you can't see my eyes (2x)
I got my locs on (2x)
And you can't tell I'm high (2x)

I got my locs on, welcome to the terrordome
I got them carrots on givin off them pheromones
Women love it when they see me on that motorcycle
Niggas hate it cuz they know I'm makin more than Michael
Been ballin since the word ballin played out
They brought it back to describe me in that maybach
Me and Jeezy Jeezy rollin with our locs on
Smokin somethin good fuckin up the ozone


Brand new Versaces ran me a buck 50
(they must have set you back) naw baby not really
Switchin lanes yes yea the chopper's just silly
When it's bustin at your ass we just laughin at ya really
I got my locs on dickies on keep the workin niggas on
Keep the cashmere vickis on yea she keep them vickis on
Keep my locs on see you hatin motherfuckers
Keep my locs on you know they match my bag suckas
You might also like

I got my locs on cuz my eyes are burgundy
And when I get home I don't want the third degree
The verdict be urgently these niggas wanna murder me
They scared of the consequences comin from my defenses
It ain't that expensive have your ass hoppin fences
Lucky motherfucker missed your ass by some inches
Next time understand what you fuckin' with, it's legendary status
Sittin behind these glasses nigga
