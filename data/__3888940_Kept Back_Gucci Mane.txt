Huh, It's Gucci
Ooh
Huh, Wop, whoa
Lil Pump
Burr, yeah, bling, ooh, blow
M-M-M-Murda
Hah

Murda on the beat with the murder man (Uh)
Ben Simmons, shake 'em with the left hand (Skrrt)
Steppin' on this dope like a step-dad (Step-dad)
Too turnt up, can't help that (Damn)
Shittin' on a hater, no Ex-Lax
Watch so dumb, it got kept back (Huh?)
Bitch so thick, she can't help that (Wow)
'Cause she livin' out the jet, got jet-lag (Huh)
Need a real boss bitch, I can't help that (Huh)
And her brain so dumb, we got kept back (Dumb)
Just flew in designer to the book bag (Huh)
Tell her need somethin' real good to look at (Look)
Booty so big, it got kept back (Damn)
Pull up in the Dawn, let the roof back (Roof)
Don't tell me that you love me, baby, prove that (Love me)
Chain keep flickin' and the gang keep springin' (Burr)
You might also like
Got a lot of ice on my neck, man, damn, man
Hundred bands hangin' on my backpack
Wrist so cold, need a icepack
Put four hundred bands in the mic stand
Woke up in the morning, bought a Maybach, ooh
I'ma go do what I want to do
Got your baby mama naked, twerkin' out the sunroof
Damn, boo, I'ma keep it real, I don't fuck with you
'Cause you got an attitude, just cashed out on a Bentley Coupe, yeah
I'ma go and fuck your bitch tomorrow, whoa
Gucci loafers on when I walk, though
Lil Pump smash your main ho (Wow)
And she gon' do what I say so
I'ma show you how I live life, ooh
Made two mil in one night
Whole body covered in ice
Pourin' up fours in my Tropical Sprite

Murda on the beat with the murder man (Uh)
Ben Simmons, shake 'em with the left hand (Skrrt)
Steppin' on this dope like a step-dad (Step-dad)
Too turnt up, can't help that (Damn)
Shittin' on a hater, no Ex-Lax
Watch so dumb, it got kept back (Huh?)
Bitch so thick, she can't help that (Wow)
'Cause she livin' out the jet, got jet-lag (Huh)
Need a real boss bitch, I can't help that (Huh)
And her brain so dumb, we got kept back (Dumb)
Just flew in designer to the book bag (Huh)
Tell her need somethin' real good to look at (Look)
Booty so big, it got kept back (Damn)
Pull up in the Dawn, let the roof back (Roof)
Don't tell me that you love me, baby, prove that (Love me)
Chain keep flickin' and the gang keep springin' (Burr)
Nigga keep mixin' with the music (Music)
Baby you a human jacuzzi (Damn)
I'ma twist a bitch like a Rubik's (Rubik's)
I'ma turn my book to a movie, Gucci
I'ma put a bitch in a movie, porno
Rockstar couple, Cher, Bono
Might start my wife Muliano
Pull up, ten bricks of that Nelly Furtado
El Gato down under The Hamptons (Hamptons)
My bitch in blue hair, Marge Simpson (Marge)
Pull up with a driver in a Phantom (Damn)
Pinky ring sick, got cancer (Ugh)
I was just sellin' dope on camera (Skrrt)
Now I got my own shoes like The Answer (Huh)
Might pull up, throw some money on a dancer (Damn)
Had to tip my earrings 'cause they dancin' (Dancin')

Murda on the beat with the murder man (Uh)
Ben Simmons, shake 'em with the left hand (Skrrt)
Steppin' on this dope like a step-dad (Step-dad)
Too turnt up, can't help that (Damn)
Shittin' on a hater no Ex-Lax
Watch so dumb, it got kept back (Huh?)
