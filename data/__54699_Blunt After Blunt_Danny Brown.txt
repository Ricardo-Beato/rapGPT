65 ContributorsBlunt After Blunt Lyrics
Kush got a nigga feeling awesome
Ate that bitch pussy 'til she squirted like a dolphin (Dolphin)
Told her bend over (Over), hit that shit doggy (Doggy)
Called her a cab, then I told that bitch to call me (Stop)
Danny Brown, bitch (Bitch), tell me what you need (Need)
I got some Adderall and fire-ass weed (Smoke)
And they try to tell me I get too high
That's a lie, if so, bitch, I woulda been died (Stop)
But the flow OD (D), don't get Cochised, capiche?
Or fuck with me, fuck around and be deceased (Blatt)
Rest in peace wack niggas (Wack), with oversized clothes
Complain about my jeans 'cause I'm takin' all they hoes (Hoes)
Hold up (Hah), wait a minute (Stop)
Your pussy ain't shit 'til you had some Danny in it (Stop)
I'm gone off a Xanny, noddin' off, watching Menace (What?)
Rollin' up some purple that my nigga call Grimace (Smoke)
Bitch, I ain't finished (Nah)
These bars was test tubed in the lab before a chemist (Go)
Rolling testers on it, but statistics got slumped (Got slumped)
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt (Stop)
You might also like
'Til my brain feel ten pounds heavier (Stop)
You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica (What?)
Bitch give me brain (Brain), for the hell of it (Uh)
But to her it's heaven even if she gets a smell of it (Hah)
That's why these bitches fuck with me
'Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC (Hah)
You get it? (Get it?)
How about me and your girlfriend, you with it? (With it?)
Money over everything the only thing that matter (Stop)
And since I been gettin' it, these blunts be getting fatter (Smoke)
Take a couple puffs off it, now a nigga woozy (Woozy)
The white hoes I fuck with, consider them whootys (Whootys)
We 'bout to make a movie (Stop)
Starring me and a cast full of groupies (Stop)
And I do my own stunts (My own stunts)
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt (Stop)15Embed
