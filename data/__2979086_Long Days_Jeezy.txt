4 ContributorsLong Days LyricsI can't get the pain away (I can't get the pain away)
Rain drops fall on my face (Rain drops fall on my face)
With every (?) days, All my blue skies have turned to, grey
(Verse 1)
(Young Jeezy)
Take a sip of the Henny, then I hit the dro
Sit back in my Impala, release it slow
Remember like it was yesterday, talking all this drama
Fuck early morning arguing, just me and my mama
Tell me I need to go to school man I'm like fuck that
Left right out the house, headed, right to the trap
But it didn't stop there, it was like it was a curse
Cause as time went on, everything got worse
I started comin in the house, at all times of night
My sister lighting candles cause we ain't got no lights
I know you thinking "Damn but hold up Peep"
It's the middle of the winter, and we ain't got not heat
I knew something was wrong, ain't nobody been here my ass
Man one of y'all motherfuckers done been up in my stash
You just stood there, crazy, like "Who you talkin' to?"
Then I said them five words; "Bitch I'm talkin' to you"!
How could your own creation, talk to you that way
How could your child, talk to you that way
I swear I couldn't explain, the pain in your eyes
You just stood there silent, like you was hypnotized
Every time I think about it, it just makes me weak
How that one tear, just rolled down your cheek
I done got a little older, there's a lot of things I realize
With every five in my body momma I really apologize
You might also like
I can't get the pain away (I can't take the pain away)
Rain drops fall on my face (Rain drops fall on my face)
With every (?) days, All my blue skies have turned to, grey
(Verse 2)
I done came of age player, gettin money for real
Anything you need to cop dawg, shit, holla for real
Pull up to the club, man these hoes jockin my ride
It might look all gravy but I'm dying inside
Man this street life shit, keeps me on the run
I can't remember the last time I spent time with my son
Man I love him to death me and his mama don't see I to eye
She fucked my first Cuz so I guess y'all can see why
But it's all gravy player, blood thicker than water
Just know I would have never tried the mother of your daughter
Got too much love for ya, but it's obvious to see
That maybe you don't feel the same way about me
Hey listen to me dawg, like I'm kickin some knowledge
And then I turn around and do the same shit to (?)
I ain't mad at you Cuz, cause you still my nigga
Shit I fought the bitch player, cause you still my nigga
Can't forget about my niggas, Mailman and Kinky B
Cause if there was no y'all, there would be no me
Man I love y'all niggas to death, shit I can't lie
If something happen to one of y'all, I'd probably die
And to my Cuz (?) I ain't forgot about you dawg
Sometimes I don't know what I would do without you dawg
I'm supposed been gon, why they keep playin with me
Lord tell me who it is, who keep prayin for me
I can't get the pain away (I can't take the pain away)
Rain drops fall on my face (Rain drops fall on my face)
With every (?) days, All my blue skies have turned to, greyEmbed
