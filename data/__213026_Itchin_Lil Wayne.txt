43 ContributorsItchin Lyrics
She say my dickhead need a crown on it
She say my cum tastes like holy water
She say she get hiccups just thinkin' of me
I said, "Next time, bring your drinkin' buddy"
I told her, this that Dedication 5
And anything else is a consolation prize
I said, "I'm cumming," she say, "Take your time"

Yeah, I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none
I asked her, "Who this pussy for?" She said "Ransom"
And when she says "I Love You", I say, "Shut up, take this dick"
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist
And then he calls with all that bitchin'
"Who is this?" She busy, call her later

Now we switchin' positions, we in here getting creative
I put Champagne on her titties, then sip it out her navel, boy
I live in pussy, let me speak to my neighbors, I say
Clean the puke off of the toilet bowl
Treat the pussy like revolving doors
Ran outta rubbers at the corner store
She in my ear, like "What you want them for?"
Well, give me brains since you a smart-aleck
Fuck her all night and don't smell it
Open her mind like a watermelon, haha, you jealous
You might also like
I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none
I asked her who this pussy for, she said ransom
And when she says "I Love You", I say,  "Shut up, take this dick"
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist
He on that phone with all that bitchin'
"Who is this?" She busy, call her later
Now we kissin', we twisted, my dick in a tornado
She say, "Hit it," I hit it, I hit it raw like yayo, I admit it

(That fuckin' corner store man)
Uh, we makin' love like money
Yeah, yeah, like money
Like money
Told her this that Dedication 5
Dedication 5
I killed that pussy, it came back to life

I told her take her drawers off and she said "Why you playin' dumb?"
I asked her "Who this pussy for?" She didn't answer
And she say "Ooh, I love you," I said "Shut up, take this dick"
Would tell her say my name, but I gave her an alias

And oh my god she swallowed triplets, she gripped with
The hand that rocks the cradle, I'm so lifted, what is this? This here a Dedication
It was scripted, predicted, and shout out to my skaters
Boy, I live in pussy, let me speak to my neighbors, I say
D5
What up 5?
I told her this that Dedication 5
We makin' love like money13Embed
