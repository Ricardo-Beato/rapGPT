20 ContributorsAll Night Long Lyrics
Yeah.. wanna feel the vi-ah-hi-hibe
Wanna feel the vibe, wanna feel the vi-ibe!
Uhhh.. wanna, what? Yeah
Wanna, what? Uhh, yeah (come on)
Every-bod', c'mon, uhh
Yo, yo.. (all night long)

During divine hours, I use mind power to refine
Flower girls, and make 'em feel like black pearls
Get they minds off acryllic nails and the rap world
It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl
Ma-sons build in lodges, we be in garages
Discussin' who we boned and who God is
Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners
I kick it for the Chevy ridin' head to backstreet leaners

Allllll.. (uhh) niiiiiight.. (yea yea, what?) 
Allllll..  niiiiiight.. (whatcha say now Bee, what?)
Allllll.. (yeah, yeah yeah) niiiiiight.. 
(to freak it with the) Allllll.. (now let me get a piece of this)
(let me get a piece Bee) niiiiiight..

Check it, check it
I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail
Tryna make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell
Locked in this Grid like a 2Pac tale
Wild hair and rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought
With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin' thoughts to my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to walk like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle
I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel
(come on bay-bayyy) Bust it
You might also like
Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you
Alllllll night looooong
Allllllll (come on bay-bayyy)
All night long.. all night long..
All night long.. on and on and on and onnnn (come on bay-bayyy)
Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you (all night long)
Alllllll night looooong (all night long)
Allllllll (on and on and on and onnnn) 
Iahhhhh (all night long) jus' wanna rock you (all night long)
Alllllll night looooong (all night long)
{what? yo-yo, yo-yo yo-yo check it, check it}
On and on and on and onnnn

A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense
The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses
Opportunity and the beat knocks
Women, give me rhythm like beatbox, but it's the year
Of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash'
Who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks
Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike
Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got site/sight
Like a construction worker, when it's time to build
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's time to kill
In perserverence I'mma find a meal, and provoke
My Gramps used to trick off big papers at the Riverboat
It go..
Allllll.. niiiiiight.. all night
Allllll.. niiiiiight.. you got it goin all night
Allllll.. niiiiiight.. y'know, y'know it all night
Allllll.. niiiiiight.. oahahhhoahhohhhhhh (yea, yeah)

Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you (one more time)
Alllllll night looooong, oahhhhohhh (ebb in feelings)
Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you (I ain't sleeping)
Alllllll night looooong (all night long)
On and on and on and onnnn

Check it
I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein' street
On the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggas in my box throwin suggestions
Had me checkin' myself and double checkin', I popped the resurrection
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips
Writin niggas with stripes, I hold posture with
Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich
Givin em voicemail, tracks are like County
To them I voice-jail/gel, if you believe in Heaven
Why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?
Why is this choice Hell?
Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you
Alllllll night looooong, oahhhhohhh (keep goin)
Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you (keep goin, keep goin, keep on)
(and don't you give up) Alllllll night looooong (ah keep on, ah keep on)
Ooahhhoahhhhh (ah keep on, ah keep.. ah don't you give up)
Iahhhhh (all night long) jus' wanna rock you (all night long)
Alllllll night looooong (if you want it you can have it lay upon my rest)
On and on and on and onnnnnnnnnn (keep it goin baby)
(if you want it you can have it lay upon my rest)
Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you (all night long)
Alllllll night looooong (if you want it you can have it lay upon my rest)
(all night long) On and on and on and onnnnnnnn
Alllllll (if you want it you can have it lay upon my rest) niiiiiiiight
Alllllll (and if you want it you can have it lay upon my rest) niiiiiiight
Alllllll niiiiiiiiight

Yeahhhhhh.. Common Sense, and Baduuuu2Embed
