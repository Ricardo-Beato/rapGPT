1 ContributorFame Lyrics
Make you feel like you can walk on water
Oughta blame the fame, see the list got shorter
Famous, fame in nations, publicist managers, public relations
SOMETIMES THE FIRST GETS ALL THE PERKS
PUBLICIST MANAGER LAWYER LURKS
WHO ENDS UP AS THE JERK WHO JERKS
EVERYBODY EVENTUALLY HITS THE DIRT
SOMETIMES FAME AINT GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH WORK
CHECK THE LIST READ BETWEEN THE TEARS WHO GOT JERKED
Across the seven lands, seven seas, OMG
Time flies, DJ Lord give me a fly-by
It is I, mindin' my own mind
FATHER TIME BE THE BOSS
COMES AT A COST
HE AINT NEVER LOST
FAME IS FAKE
CAUSE IT FADES
POP THE FAME BUBBLE
CAUSE HE AND SHE GOT GAME TROUBLE
MISSING PERSON ALERT
EVERYBODYS POCKETS AND FEELING HURT
FAME FORTUNE ATTENTION DID I MENTION
(Flavor verse)
FLAVOR WOOD I MEAN HOLLYWOOD
OSCAR EVEN SMOKIN NEWPORTS
SIPPIN THAT DRINK WHAT THE FUCK YOU THINK?
MY HEAD GOT BIG CAUSE I GOT THAT CRANK
FAME IS MY NEW NAME
ROLLS ROYCE IS MY NEW GAME
I GOT THAT BANK I CAN MAKE IT RAIN
CASH MONEY BABY SO REMEMBER THE NAME
YEAH THATS RIGHT I CAME BACK HOME ONE TIME
TO PUT RET TOPS OUT ON THE BLOCK
AND GOT THE STOCK
AND BROKE OUT AND TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE
AND MOVED TO LA TO THROW A FRITO LAY
OFF THE DOCK OF THE BAY
NOW ME AND CHUCK D STILL MAKING RECORDS
THAT YOU PLAY
EVERY WRONG SHT THAT GETS IN OUR WAY WE SLAY
WELL BULLDOZE YOU DOWN LIKE
ELIN NORDEGREN DID TO TIGER WOODS CRIB
ITS ON THE INTERNET
You might also like(Chuck D second verse)
EITHER MAKES YOU YOU HIT IT OR QUIT IT NO SHT
SO WHAT YOU WANNA DO WHAT YOU GONNA DO
I COME OFF THE ROAD FROM NOWHERE AND I BROUGHT MY CREW
MAKE YOURSELF VALUABLE SO THE MONEY CHASES YOU
FAME AINT EQUAL CAUSE IT CAN DEGRADE YOU
SOMEBODY CLAIM THEY MADE YOU
FAME MAY MAKE YOU BREAKABLE THEN BREAK YOU
INSTEAD OF NOT PAYING TEACHERS FOR TEACHIN
THE YOUNG GET HUNG UP AND MURDER FOR SNEAKERS
FAMOUS JUST TO BE FAMOUS
PAPARAZZI AIM IS
WHAT MY NAME IS
SHE USED TO SING GOSPEL
THEN BROKE AWAY FROM GODS SPELL
PITFALL WAS PITIFUL
AS SHE LAY IN THE HOSPITAL
FAMOUS POLITICIANS IN THE 80S LED TO THE BIRTH OF CRACK BABIES
DJ LORD SAVE US FROM THOSE THAT CRIED DAVIS
MACHINE OF THE ACTS CREATED I HATE IT
(Flavor verse repeat)
FLAVOR WOOD I MEAN HOLLYWOOD
OSCAR EVEN SMOKIN NEWPORTS
SIPPIN THAT DRINK
WHAT THE FUCK YOU THINK?
MY HEAD GOT BIG
CAUSE I GOT THAT CRANK
FAME IS MY NEW NAME
ROLLS ROYCE IS MY NEW GAME
I GOT THAT BANK
I CAN MAKE YOU THINK
CASH MONEY BABY SO REMEMBER THE NAME
YEAH THATS RIGHT I CAME BACK HOME ONE TIME
TO PUT RED TOPS OUT ON THE BLOCK
GOT IN A STOCK
AND BROKE OUT AND TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE
AND MOVED TO LA TO THROW A FRITO LAY
OFF THE DOCK OF THE BAY
NOW ME AND CHUCK D STILL MAKING RECORDS
THAT YOU PLAY
EVERY ONE THAT GETS IN OUR WAY WE SLAY
WE FOOLED THOSE WHO DOUBT LIKE
ELIN NORDEGREN
DID TO TIGER WOODS CRIB
ITS ON THE INTERNETEmbed
