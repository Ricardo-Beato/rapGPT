11 ContributorsDeath Lyrics
Let me live my life
We can no longer live our lives
Then let us give our lives for the liberation
And salvation of the Black Nation
Saints, saviors, soldiers, scholars, healers and killers
No longer dead, deaf, dumb and blind out of our mind
Brainwashed with the white man's mind
No more homicide
No more fratricide
No more suicide, infanticide and genocide
Look the goddamn white man in his cold blue eyes
Devil don't even try, we Bebe's Kids
We don't die, we multiply
You heard the Death Side
Now open your black eyes for the rebirth, resurrection and riseYou might also like1Embed
