Gonna set You free

They know something
Some things don't matter (Set me free)
You wish I ain't me
You and time matter (Gonna set You)
You wish I ain't me
I don't find out
You wish I ain't me
**** inside now

Why you so scared that somebody find out?
I am a flex, imagine your ex face when he find out
I am the best, you hit the top, wait 'til they find out (Set me free)
He not a threat, send him a text, put him on timeout (Set me free)

Keep the flowers, send a hunnid thousand (Set me free)
Keep the flowers, send a hunnid thousand (Set me free)
Keep the flowers, I said hunnid thousand
Took you out that metro housin', drop your name on my new album (Gonna set You free)

Your life finna change right now (Set me free)
Your life finna change right now
Balenciaga for all your friends, Hermès for the argument
Your life finna change right now (It's gonna set You free)

Why you so scared that somebody find out?
I am a flex, imagine your ex face when he find out
I am the best, you hit the top, wait 'til they find out
He not a threat, send him a text, put him on timeout

Your life finna change right now
Balenciaga for all your friends, Hermès for the argument
Your life finna change right now

Don't bring friends around, I wouldn't— behind your back
That's the new rule, rules are rules
And not now then when, if not me then who?
You blacked out your page, went missing for days
They know you with me
You blacked out your page and switched up your boots
They know you with me
You switched up the Benz, you switched it again
I know what you need
You usually go combo, they don't even call you
They know you with me (Gonna set You free)

Your life finna change right now (It's gonna set You free)
Your life finna change right now (Gonna set You free)
Lord, take me
Lord, take me
Lord, take me where You wanna take me
Too much trauma lately, your life finna change right now (Gonna set You free)

Your life finna change right now (Set me free)
Your life finna change right now (Gonna set You free)
Your life finna change right now (Set me free)
Your life finna change right now (Gonna set You free)

(Set me free)
(Gonna set You free)
(Set me free)
