30 ContributorsIn the Hood Lyrics

"The story your about to see
Occurred along the main trading route
On the border between the North and South
At a small outpost called Red Clay Village"

What the fuck y'all, niggas, thought, huh, what you thinkin', bitch?
Are you stupid, son? Must be stupid kid
What the fuck is wrong? It's the Wu, bitch
Ain't got a clue, bitch, tie your shoe, bitch
Get the fuck back 'fore we break a f…, listen
Tryna to tell y'all, niggas, give you a fair warnin'
Just a chance to live so you can see your kids
Yo, son, nah, before I split your wig
I'd rather feed you this, but you ain't wanna eat it
So now you got to feel it!


Yo, what the, yo
Let me fuck it one more time then y'all can fuck
Y'know how we do it in the hood
Yo, yeah, turn the mic up, yeah, yo
You might also like
Y'all niggas better rock y'all hoodies
Take money, snatch jewelry in the (Hood)
You find the best woman lookin' good
Diamond, she need polishin'
In my hood all the gunshot legal
At the same time we gotta stop killin' our people
Keep it in the (Hood), niggas walk with they gun
Keep it in the (Hood), that's where we come from
I rep Brooklyn, home of the gangsta
I know a few murderer, drug dealer
In the (Hood) we speak mathematics and build
What's the total weight of the brain? Allah real
Slang jacks and hold gats, in the (Hood), 80 proof
Get my dick sucked on the rood of the projects
Dice game in the park, blunt sessions after dark
Movin' with the Wesson
Welcome to the God we build and drop a lesson
Pussy hole testin', in the hood
Got the word from the hoodrat, shorty on the wood

Murder, bad boy, you block off
Murder, rude boy, you pop off
Murder, nine millimeter, me say
Murder, no time for talk, wanna
Murder, men and dem all talk 'bout the
Murder, Masta Killa come calm with nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Me say murder
Ay yo, we boys in the hood, big bad wolves in the woods
It ain't all good, pass the goods
Deep in the project halls waitin' to shine
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs, in the hood
Niggas put twenties on hoopties
Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie
And keep dough on the flip, a hoe on the strip
And roll dick, throw on the flip (Hood)
Weed clouds (Pow) thick enough to block the sun
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun
Understood? Far from your Hollywood
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the (Hood)
From project chicks with hips and slim waists
From five dollar plates, apartment six H
O.G., I spit G to the young ones
I keep it in the hood, that's where I come from

Murder, bad boy, you block off
Murder, rude boy, you pop off
Murder, nine millimeter, me say
Murder, no time for talk, wanna
Murder, men and dem all talk 'bout the
Murder, Masta Killa come calm with nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Me say murder
This is the place where thugs is born
(In the hood) Blink too long, your life is gone
(In the hood) Convicts still live with they moms
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm
(In the hood) Crack fiends'll furnish a 'Llac
(In the hood) African's be drivin' cabs
(In the hood) In the streets the ghetto is hot
And the illest gangsters on the block's the cops
(In the hood) The ones you love'll fill you with slugs
(In the hood) Babies born addicted to drugs
(In the hood) We make life or death decisions
And the school system is like a minimal prison
So you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin'
(In the hood) It ain't all good, repent or you sinnin'

Murder, bad boy, you block off
Murder, rude boy, you pop off
Murder, nine millimeter, me say
Murder, no time for talk, wanna
Murder, men and dem all talk 'bout the
Murder, Masta Killa come calm with nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Me say murder
Murder, bad boy, you block off
Murder, rude boy, you pop off
Murder, nine millimeter, me say
Murder, no time for talk, wanna
Murder, men and dem all talk 'bout the
Murder, Masta Killa come calm with nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Me say murderEmbed
