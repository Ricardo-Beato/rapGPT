26 ContributorsThe Doctorâ€™s Office Lyrics
With someone else's lover, lover
Back in bed again
Yes, may I help you?
Hello, I had a twelve o' clock appointment with Dr. Dre
Well, Dr. Dre is with another patient right now
Would you like to reschedule?
Reschedule? Um, it must be a mistake
I must see him, I had a twelve o'clock appointment
No, it's no mistake, look, Dr. Dre is with another patient
Either you can wait or reschedule
Look, I understand all of that, but
No, apparently you don't understand
You know I'm a working person and
And I'm working too
Just where is Dr. Dre? I need to see him
Well, open up the door and you'll see his big dick fucking somebody

You like that?
Like that?
Yes, yes
You like that?
Give it to me
I'ma give it to you
I'ma give it to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
Damn, you're goodYou might also like6Embed
