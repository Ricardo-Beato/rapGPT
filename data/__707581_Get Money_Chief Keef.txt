Young Chop on the beat
Sos' baby, Blood gang baby, Fifth gang baby
Chopsquad-Chopsquad-Chopsquad-Chopsquad
Ayy, Get It Gang baby
Know I'm rockin' cut off stockings
Keep kush in my pockets
All designer, get your grind up

'Member posted the block stealing Hondas (Sos' baby)
Now I ride foreigns and Tonkas, stuntin' (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
'Member when I ain't have no money (No)
Now I get money, get money (Yeah, fff beep)
Get money, get money (Beep), get money, get money (Beep)
Get money, get money, get money, get money (Fff beep, beep)
Get money, get money, get money, ayy, ayy (Fff beep)
Get money, get money, get money

I wear Moncler, Louis, Gucci, I'm stuntin' (Stuntin')
And my pants, they filled with money (Hundreds)
I saw your bitch she want me, she want me, she want me (She want me, ayy)
She on me, she on me, she on me (She on me)
I like blue cheese, blue cheese with my chicken and onions (And onions)
I pull 'em out my pocket and I'm stuntin' (Stuntin')
I'm talking 'bout them hundreds, them hundreds, them hundreds (Fff beep)
I'm stuntin', I'm stuntin', it's nothin' (Beep)
You got your Louis, where your cake? (Ayy)
Got your Gucci, where your cake? (Where your cake? Ayy)
You ain't got no cake (Where yo cake?), it's okay, it's okay (It's okay)
All I gotta say (Say), go rob and get the cake (Cake)
'Cause If I can make it, you can make it any day, ayy

And I'm always moving gathering something (Something)

But I'm smart and I know she stuntin' (I know she be stuntin')
Baby, is it 'cause I'm blingin'? I'm blingin', I'm shinin', I'm stuntin'
I pull up fresh like I'm going to luncheon (Skrrt, going to luncheon)
I feel like I'm the only, the only one in here, stuntin'
And if I didn't this shit wouldn't be funkin'
All I know get money get money get money, ayy (Fff beep)

If you ain't getting money, what you doing? (What you doing?)
I swear I be on that money ball shit (Shit)
