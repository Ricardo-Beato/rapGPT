25 ContributorsStreet Nigga Sacrifice Lyrics
Ran from the task force, my lifestyle like a rodeo horse
Had a dream in a porsche then I woke up and had to go to court
Got a lawyer, dropped the cases, now you see me on the pages
XXL magazine, December issue cover Fader
They sayin' Migos better than the Beatles
Paul McCartney, I would like to meet him
Young niggas from the Northside with Lyor Cohen havin' brunch meetings
Huncho, where the fam?, I got to feed 'em, private jet in the six seater
Quavo livin' legend, Elvis, that's why I pull up Lincoln Continental, gone!

Came in the game, we had somethin' to prove
Came in the game, we had nothin' to lose
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice
Clean it up then you got to flip the money twice
Clean it up then you got to flip the money twice
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice

Street nigga just want a Beamer
On the Northside, police givin' subpenea's
Pistol in the locker, Gilbert Arenas
Grandma was a sacrifice, can't forget
We can see the fuck shit and we with it
Trappin' out the bando, behind the door was a semi
Real got the squad, Quavo whip it scientific
Juggin' iPhones, so we made a half a ticket
Real street nigga sacrifice
And you in the trap, watch out for the mice
Please don't get it twisted, we on the mic
Choppas eat you niggas like a termite
Bloody money turn to clean money
Fiend money that got bean money
I seen money and I dream money
Listerine wash it, I clean money
You might also like
Came in the game, we had somethin' to prove
Came in the game, we had nothin' to lose
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice
Clean it up then you got to flip the money twice
Clean it up then you got to flip the money twice
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice

Street nigga sacrifice, takin' penitentiary chances, nigga, day and night
No re in the sacrifice, I pull up in the Lamborghini, turn on the lights
Gotta thank god for my life, shit that happen over night
Well respected, Migos Gang, we rep this worldwide, takin' nine hour flights
When you a young rich nigga, you do what you like
Want a feature, nigga gotta pay the price
Pourin' act in the cream soda, fuck the sprite
Cut the lights off and in the club, my diamonds bright
In the kitchen with the egg beater, hop in the Lamborghini, that's a two seater
Work come from Columbia, name it Catalina
Might just take a trip, just go to Geneva

Came in the game, we had somethin' to prove
Came in the game, we had nothin' to lose
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice
Clean it up then you got to flip the money twice
Clean it up then you got to flip the money twice
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice
Street nigga sacrifice, street nigga sacrifice5Embed
