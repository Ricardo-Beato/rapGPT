27 ContributorsKitty Kat Lyrics
(J.R.)

Say what you want, but a bitch be workin'
Clown-ass bitch, I ain't comin' to the circus
Broke-ass niggas on the internet hurtin'
Big booty bitch, gettin' rich off twerkin'
Fuck that, if I had a dick, make 'em suck that
Pull up to the club, make a nigga get the fuck back
Superstar and you little hoes my groupies
I'm done givin' fifteen minutes to these goofies
Big wheels rollin', can't tell how shit feel
Bitch, how I change when I only got big bills? (Ah)
Problem, and that waist on Coke bottle
Walkin' these hoes like a runway model
Trust me, I'm finna get free like Tubman (Bye)
I'll never let another labеl try to fuck me
Bad bitch, and I'm on point like a cactus
I bet a rеal bitch be the last one laughin' (Ah)

Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, here kitty
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, ah
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, here kitty
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, ah
Pussy-ass nigga, don't hide that tail (Tail)
Number one rule: don't kiss and tell (Tell)
Ass so fat, finna break that scale (Ah)
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, yeah
You might also like
These bitches keep sayin' they run shit, how? (Huh?)
When the last you hoes even worked out?
And runnin' your mouth don't count
Messy-ass bitch, close the motherfuckin' app out
Is anybody round this bitch keepin' score?
Grammy-nominated pussy, bitch, I got four (Bitch, I got four)
Cover after cover, I'm raw, no rubber (Ah)
All year 'round, havin' hot girl summer (Mwah)
I'm the shit, that's why these hoes pissed
I can spill the tea, but I'm not a messy bitch
And ever since I came out the pussy, I was lit
I knew I was a problem when them hoes start to diss
Them niggas fucked up when they let me get rich (Yeah)
I started gettin' money and I got on my Beyoncé
Them hoes gotta sign an NDA to come around me
I'm feelin' like Kelis 'cause a bitch real bossy (Ah)

Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, here kitty
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, ah
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, here kitty
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, ah
Pussy-ass nigga, don't hide that tail (Tail)
Number one rule: don't kiss and tell (Tell)
Ass so fat, finna break that scale (Ah)
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, yeah
P is for "pussy," P-U-S-S-Y
That pussy, P-U-S-S-Y
That pussy, P-U-S-S-Y
That pussy (Yeah)
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, yeah

Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, here kitty
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, here kitty
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty
Pussy-ass nigga, don't hide that tail
Number one rule: don't kiss and tell
Ass so fat, finna break that scale
Here, kitty-kitty, here, kitty-kitty, yeah3Embed
