Check her out, she hella, somebody oughta tella her
Her ass got a voice and she sing acapella
I could be her music, pumping in the background
I can make her lose it and find it in Chi-Town
Club of America, legs so tall
I stepped out America, call it AWOL
Bitch I am a go getta, that hook's forever
Know y'all heard that 12 Play, that hook's forever
I need a parachute cause I'm falling for that pyussy
I need a flashlight cause I'm deep up in that pyussy
I been 'round here, better look 'round here
Young fella, they call me the king 'round here
And now I got my voice back, better listen 'round here
I'm the shit, y'all niggas just smell 'round here
Got them chicks flipping for me, best friends kissing for me
Ay Magic City in the backroom stripping for me
Ya man is like Nextel, soon gone
Girl you can always call on me, Apple phone

Falling (For you), Falling (For you)
Falling (For you), falling
I think I need a p-p-p-p-p
I think I need a p-p-p-p-p
I think I need a parachute, parachute, parachute
I think I need a parachute, parachute, parachute
Cause I'm going (D-d-down on you, d-d-down on you)
I'm bungee jumping in it, woah
D-d-down on you, down on you, down on you
You might also like
I like yo legs, the way you move
You know gymnastics, I know magic
You know fashion, Emilio
I'm falling for yo head, I wanna see you blow (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm balling on the edge, you need a vocal coach
I'm a Skywalker, mask off
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, I'm about to blast off
Space rocket, we out of here (Pluto)
You compliment my mojo (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You stroking on my ego
You wanna go to Pluto
And make movies everyday of your life (Mars)

It's something about them lashes girl
That really compliments ya eyes
It's something about them fishnets girl
That's hugging yet revealing ya thighs, that's got me

Falling (For you), Falling (For you)
Falling (For you), falling
I think I need a p-p-p-p-p
I think I need a p-p-p-p-p
I think I need a parachute, parachute, parachute
I think I need a parachute, parachute, parachute
Cause I'm going (D-d-down on you, d-d-down on you)
I'm bungee jumping in it, whoa
D-d-down on you, down on you, down on you
Hey! Comeback, comeback, comeback, shawty got that comeback
Anda, anda, anda, andale
You got me wishing I speak Spanish
You got me feeling real mannish
I'm about to turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
We set the roof on fire, it's about to burn up
Winding, winding, winding, I see you grinding
Overnight, one night with me and now we shining
I got yo attitude in Venus
I got you begging to catch my semen
Bravo, bravo, bravo, you deserve a bravo
And you flyer than a pilot, auto

It's something about them lashes girl
That really compliments ya eyes
It's something about them fishnets girl
That's hugging yet revealing ya thighs
That's got me

Falling (For you), Falling (For you)
Falling (For you), falling
I think I need a p-p-p-p-p
I think I need a p-p-p-p-p
I think I need a parachute, parachute, parachute
I think I need a parachute, parachute, parachute
Cause I'm going (D-d-down on you, d-d-down on you)
I'm bungee jumping in it, whoa
D-d-down on you, down on you, down on you2Embed
