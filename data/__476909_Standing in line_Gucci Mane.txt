2 times

Gucci Mane coming
Gucci Mane coming
Got you standing in the line like them number 9's coming
Number 9 Jordans
Gotta sneak the toy in
Alex supposed to be my boy
Man you ain't gonna let your boy in
Mr. Smith and Wesson
Still shop at the West end
Traphouse on a dead end
And you get let in with an FN
I'm bout to take the flight for the crest homie
Send a box with a Bouldercrest address on it
My little girl daughter card got A's on it
She ask me why all of my cars got F's on it
My Momma ask me Gucci why you put a vest on
50 grand cause the car got a kit on it
You might also like
They told me that 26's couldn't fit on it
Smoking Oreo cookie in the Cockpit
50 thousand dollars cause it got a body kit
Big chip shawty charger with the big lip
Remember they said 26's couldn't  fit on it
So I went & spent another 150 on it
Don't pull that bullshit up to mine because I'll shit on it
People stop to be like how you get them 6's on it

That bitch is sitting fucking high they think I got switches on it
But only thing that Ima do is try to switch opponents
They say I spent 150 all for the moment
If I was you man tell the truth man I wouldn't run up on me
I'm swerving out I hit the gas that fucker catching up
I'm mounted up but catching rubber man I'm smashing gas
200 pounds of swag so I'm gone have to do the dash
And my main bitch so fucking bad I didn't even mean to brag
I got that Florida tag on the brand new Jaguar
Them people get behind me I'm gon' turn to Nascar
I took them people on the chase I had to sell my last car
But now they standing in the line don't care none 'bout the weather

They told me that 26's couldn't fit on it
Smoking Oreo cookie in the Cockpit
50 thousand dollars cause it got a body kit
Big chip shawty charger with the big lip
Remember they said 26's couldn't fit on it
So I went & spent another 150 on it
Don't pull that bullshit up to mine because I'll shit on it
People stop me be like how you get them 6's on it
Nascar
Fast car
Don't park next to mine because I drag cars
Racecar
Spacecar
Don't care none bout money I had a great year
Nascar
Fast car
Don't park next to mine because I drag cars
Racecar
Spacecar
Don't care none bout money I had a great year
Nascar
Nascar
Nascar
Drive faster
She can't fuck with you you shouldn't have asked her
I dont talk I give her what she ask for

They told me that 26's couldn't fit on it
Smoking Oreo cookie in the Cockpit
50 thousand dollars cause it got a body kit
Big chip shawty charger with the big lip
Remember they said 26's couldn't fit on it
So I went & spent another 150 on it
Don't pull that bullshit up to mine because I'll shit on it
People stop me be like how you get them 6's on it1Embed
