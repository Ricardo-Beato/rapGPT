6 ContributorsRing Lyrics
Yeah, Guwop
Young mob been with me, nigga
Turn up!
BMG, fuck nigga
It's Guwop
CEO
A nigga pill with him
And the money
Migos
Guwop, nigga

I might wake up and count my money just to turn my swag up
Swag and OG bags of gas help me run my cash up
They tried to laugh at me, but Bugga help me get the last laugh
I got at your ranch styles, nigga, I got a tippy-tall stash
I can pause, replay a nigga in your motherfucking lip
But them niggas and them shitting and went through the hood, no good
What's a skrippa to a motherfucking million dollar nigga?
Big Guwop, hands off me, nigga, you know I'll go sneak in with this pistol
I'm just walking 'round the club leaving traces of blood
Drinking lean out the mug, got a four in my jug
Cold slugs in my mouth, nigga shout out to Thug
Ain't took a shower in three days, hundred keys in the tub
You might also like
Sixty Thousand dollars everytime my phone ring
Super-bad bitch, she just dropped off another fourteen
Quarter million dollars, spent that on that wine ring
In a ring full of lions, I'm the Lion King
Sixty Thousand dollars everytime my phone ring
Super-bad bitch, she just dropped off another fourteen
Quarter million dollars, spent that on that wine ring
In a ring full of lions, I'm the Lion King

And I boss you like a ring, Guwop got a ring to it
I feel like the king, put the hook on and Kareem through it
Fancy footwork on my queen, might do it like a king do it
In 95, I bought a regal man that was clean Buick
You ain't find another ho moving
Beat your featured mood, ho
Move your shoes, you know you ain't gonna do it do no
If a bunch of bees was trying to sting ya, I would through a rock at you
Big Guwop got stupid Guap and got more blocks than a brothel got
I don't put no trust in no ho, cause they run they mouth a lot
That's your big homie? Then why the fuck he wear a halter top
We go out and ball a lot, singers that the army got
She shop at Old Navy because her boyfriend tryna Save-a-Lot

Sixty Thousand dollars everytime my phone ring
Super-bad bitch, she just dropped off another fourteen
Quarter million dollars, spent that on that wine ring
In a ring full of lions, I'm the Lion King
Sixty Thousand dollars everytime my phone ring
Super-bad bitch, she just dropped off another fourteen
Quarter million dollars, spent that on that wine ring
In a ring full of lions, I'm the Lion King1Embed
