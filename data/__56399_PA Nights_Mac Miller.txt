35 ContributorsPA Nights Lyrics
Hey, ten thousand dollar hands, million dollar plan
My fam's still the only people that really know me for who I am
Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mu'fucka
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like we boys

Ayo, Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)
So make a toast to a good life (Good life)

Hey, hey, ten thousand dollar hands, billion dollar plan
Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code
Happy as hell, MDMA, yo
Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a Molotov
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' 'bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do? (Prolly yes)
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high? We can be friends
Other people pretend we hang out on the weekends
These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them
Say, "Get some rest," when I die, I'ma sleep in

Ayo, Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)
So make a toast to a good life (Good life)
Pennsylvania nights (Nights), 9:30 flights (Flights)
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? (Go)
No time to care (Care), got more I can share (Share)
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know (Know), this is all I know (Know)
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight (Took flight)
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit (Bullshit)
So make a toast to a good life (Good life)11Embed
