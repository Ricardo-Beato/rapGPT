11 ContributorsOn Tha Floor Lyrics
Aye
Writing songs for my dogs, for my squad, from my heart
How we won, how we lost
How we came, how we saw
Through it all, ashin' Backs, out the roof, foreign cars
In pursuit by the law
Still we reach for the stars
Oh my God, oh my God, so high up, I'm so far, deja vu, I've been here before, say come back down to earth just to resist the urge, still no breaks on this car, live or die, either or, go for broke, hustle hard, lead it all, on the floor, on the floor, go for broke, hustle hard, lead it all, on the floor, on the floor, lead it all, on the floor

Yeah, ha, west side of Slauson grind and make a million, we them hungry niggas in between the buildings, risking everything we got to feed our children, my city built off of love but we killed it, hard times posted with pebbles and Buddha with it, I was told the money was there, it's up to you to get it, Girbauds with the Eddie Bauer no True Religion, Ralph Lauren ski jacket with the ruger in it, quarterback in the block with the Mike Vick game, I wasn't always successful but still I made plays, under pressure I run with the rock and get away, the main focus was living to see another day
Hall of Famer in the league but I never played
I left my granny house young when I should've stayed
Motiviated by the money I was getting paid
Go getter from the start and I'll never change

On this court, live or die, either or, go for broke, hustle hard, lead it all on the floor, on the floor, go for broke, hustle hard, lead it all on the floor, on the floor, on the floor, lead it all, on the floor, on the floor, on the floor
Go for broke, hustle hard X4You might also likeEmbed
