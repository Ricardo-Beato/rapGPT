53 ContributorsSomething You Forgot Lyrics
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
That's all I can do mama
The love I'm sending
An't making it through to your heart
I hope you hear me

Pain! Since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horseshoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin' that you forgive me, give me another chance
I'm needin' it like a kidney, I don't wanna advance
Give me back her hands, give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
'Cause, um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster... BANG!
You might also like
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
I see you hidin' it, mama
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top
Keep doin' your thing
But there is something that you forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me, you are the brightest star under sunlight
See, take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
See, this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap
You've been hiding (Y'know)
Never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin', it mama)
To keep it under control (But I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
And you're well on your way to the top
But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness, shawty
But I hope you haven't forgot about meâ€”
Up in the living room, watchin' SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver; you know, they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me "butter," I called you "babe"
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say:
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn!

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart16Embed
