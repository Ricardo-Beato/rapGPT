16 ContributorsFrozen Lyrics
How can I forget you?

Rick the Ruler, Raekwon, hehe the Chef, check one, two

Touch more, taste a glass of oil, flash yours Rick
Money we saw, left 'em dead on the door, dick
Rocks look chunky on the index
Straight up, Lee vets and like old Adidas sweats
We the illest vets

Apologies, even a non-dog holler "He's honor"
Please, appreciate shit I Clark Wallabee's
Brothas wit they fists like oaks wood
Provokes doom, and you're also about to go broke soon

Mad current merchants, we nursed it, bad guerillas
Feed us like guaranteed they gon' kill us
Fleein', ninety in a night suit, G-in' white dudes
Hit the locks first, we made a right troop

I'm lushin' Russian women, via satellite I'm watchin'
I dare a nigga say he wanna battle me, I'll crush him
Even blind girls rush next to Hammera and scream out
"Oh my gosh, get the camera"
You might also like
Yo, we frozen, lay on, about now we a day on
Ill niggas yellin' "Throw Rick and Rae on"
Hydro, how did I blow, how did I flow?
Did I glow? Let them niggas know

(Yo) Rap wars commence and they kids cause offense
I don't have to say a word and your bitch' drawers are drenched
Didn't say I was gonna murder the fella
But The Ruler got some shit the could stop a herd of gorillas

Stressed wit Hollywood hoes, actin' up
Backin' up, what? This yours, what?
Crawlin' in the cut, we Lee Major
Gems on wit Timbs, brims on drawn to lay you up
Layin' in the 'dezvous, what?

Next pull up CEO wit bank books full up
Even though he's overwhelmed, this nigga Rolls Royce pull up
One of the baddest come, noddin' to a Spanish song
Slung, orange Woolridge park and a Savannah pump

Severe teaspoons, scary money on the moon
Lampin' wit a big goon, keep shit tight like a kid's room
Big Bird in the driveway, pull it out, Friday
I'm liver that way, I ride only the fly way
Olive-green thinkin', ship sinkin'
Deep-dish thinkin', big fish tank, wrist full of Franklins
This is mock-neck, shark-skin money
'88, summer, read the dunn, dummeries rock dungarees
Punctures his lung, son says "I don't want this"
Even this so-so beat I make monstrous
Lady cops stake to watch pair hoods
"Freeze, you're under arrest, you look mad good"
Hot and don't fret retard who won't let
The new sheriff's in town, what part you don't get?
Rick and Rae are now restorin' the passion
The fashion, the class, I went to work on your ass
