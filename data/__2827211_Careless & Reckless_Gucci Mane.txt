5 ContributorsCareless & Reckless Lyrics
Trapacohols
It's Gucci

I’m so fucking careless
I talk real grizzy and in my wrist freezy
And I don’t really care bitch
I’m riding in a 2 seater but I'm by myself
Because I’m so fucking selfish
I’m ride in the town and I’m smoking by the pound
Because I don’t like to share shit
And I got the things on the low
I can put you on
Talking to your square bitch

I never talk to bitches, they always talk to me
They never walking to me when they see me always run on me
What kind of future
It ain't no saving me
Im too american, im living
But girls inside my belt
Young future need some help
The realist nigga left
And I stay fresh to death
Beverly hills
And i dont need no studies
My niggas still
So very selfish, but she is so fucking
You might also like
I’m so fucking careless
I talk real grizzy and in my wrist freezy
And I don’t really care bitch
I’m riding in a 2 seater but I'm by myself
Because I’m so fucking selfish
I’m ride in the town and I’m smoking by the pound
Because I don’t like to share shit
And I got the things on the low
I can put you on
Talking to your square bitch

 numbers
Got versace put jumpers
And my  of buggatti
I had in a valley, on a back of buggatti
I'm in love with the drink
Went to sleep with the pain
Had the dream about money
And woke up in the bame

So i can see what you saying
You jumping real waters
I just to the club
I drink my  in you srills
Look in my watch that why your girlfriend in love
I drove my car in the summer
They say it's just the begining
But Gucci think he's doing numbers
I’m so fucking careless
I talk real grizzy and in my wrist freezy
And I don’t really care bitch
I’m riding in a 2 seater but I'm by myself
Because I’m so fucking selfish
I’m ride in the town and I’m smoking by the pound
Because I don’t like to share shit
And I got the things on the low
I can put you on
Talking to your square bitch

I'm counting money, he gonna take the whole 
She went on in my zone

Smoking weed I'm selfish

I’m so fucking careless
I talk real grizzy and in my wrist freezy
And I don’t really care bitch
I’m riding in a 2 seater but I'm by myself
Because I’m so fucking selfish
I’m ride in the town and I’m smoking by the pound
Because I don’t like to share shit
And I got the things on the low
I can put you on
Talking to your square bitch1Embed
