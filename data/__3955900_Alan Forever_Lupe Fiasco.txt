73 ContributorsAlan Forever Lyrics
(Are you scared? Are you scared?)
Uhh, turn up, turn up

Let me flex, get up, brush sand off myself
I was just holding my breath
Blue shorts, red shirt, how I'm dressed
I look fresh, and I feel
Bleeeeeeeeeeessed
What's your name? My name Alan
Sounds like Aylan, I love smiling
I got talents, I can do flips
I can keep my balance, I love dancing
Matter of fact, can I have one?
Right now, y'all heard the man, lights out
And the moon turns into a disco ball
Heaven, better come and get your daughter
Waltzing all on top of that water
Then Whip, then Nae-Nae, then dip
Down in my submarine
I got a pair of seats
Raise the periscope, to see parakeets
And the dinosaurs don't be scaring me
I got my own personal Dairy Queen
Satisfaction is guaranteed
I'm rather dashing, apparently
Got an airplane too, won't you come fly through the air with me?
Best thing of all
My mother says that I'm very sweet
Jonylah says "It's all cool, but what about school?
And ain't you Muslim? You can't talk 'til you marry me‚Äù
You might also like
The waves can be your cover, the beach can be your pillow
My heart can be your house, my eyes can be your windows
To teach you how to swim and then we'll play Nintendo
Beating all of your friends, dancing to the tempo
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, yeah

And they say, yeah (now entering)
Now entering that Canadian Olympic swimming team
And those medals are just glistening, so gold
So cold, yeah
And Alan did the most, all those world records he broke
That's why his nickname is the lifeguard and my God is he dope
Michael Phelps cannot believe it even though he is his coach
He might be the next Steve Zissou, or maybe Jacques Cousteau
Where he saw that little boy, go and fall off of that boat
So he jumped off in that water swam him right back to the shore
Now ain't that wild, crowd goes wild
Little boy scared so the child won't smile
So Alan get a towel to dry him off and wipe him down
Put an ice cream out, that's more his style
Father runs down that beach
Sees his son just playin' in the sand
Hugs Alan who says he's a brave little man
Walk away little boy, turns around and waves his hand
Call Jonylah say, "Guess what I did today?
Got my rescue on saved a kid today
Had my wet suit on and my fins today
Even taught him next time how to swim away"
You should really feel good that you gave your help
Might get you into heaven, might raise your health
Might get a lot of blessings, might raise your wealth
Bet you ain't even know that you saved yourself
The waves can be your cover, the beach can be your pillow
My heart can be your house, my eyes can be your windows
To teach you how to swim and then we'll play Nintendo
Be with all of your friends, dancing to the tempo
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, yeah

The waves can be your cover, the beach can be your pillow
My heart can be your house, my eyes can be your windows
To teach you how to swim and then we'll play Nintendo
Be with all of your friends, dancing to the tempo
(Are you scared?)
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan
Go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, yeah7Embed
