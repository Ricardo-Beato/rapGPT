136 ContributorsWu Tang Forever Lyrics
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu-Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!

Ayo, ayo, Wu-Tang forever, who rhyme better?
We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever
R.I.P. O.D.B, comin' through like Killa Bee
Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93
You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered
Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered
Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender
My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)
Yeah, we live and thorough
Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem
All the way to Maryland, yeah, we comin' for all 'em
Bobby Tarantino to the Digital
My shit is pivotal, smokin' chronic, no medicinal
Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?
The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone
You might also like
Ay-yo, Logic, what up?
We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style

Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more cake
Intelligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate, tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronunciate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Team makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
57 MB, yo, metallic green, seats is piped off
Seize 'em old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wil’ out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statement—stop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'
The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers, and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs, puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like The Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
III-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy, hit y'all with that "Okie-dokie"
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddamnit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one?
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

Old school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lack the principles
Got more clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun, Smokey Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
Witty unpredictable torture over your physical
Struggle bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands off I'm digital
Me and my Ladybug, back when the planet was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on
It's only Logic, we got 'em mobbin' in the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

Survival of the fittest be cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin' that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What, what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No. 9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'?
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me
Perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in sea salt
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes is two and the same
Nigga get cooked on a open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school Wu beat
This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these Wu-Tang minerals

G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Toad style is mentally strong, so strengthen your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, Jamel Irief
Wise chief, Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning Regardless, I speak logic—clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)
W.T.C., ah-ha
The faculty
Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move
Nobody slide, nobody get hurt

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu tang style
I'd like to try your Wu tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me?64Embed
