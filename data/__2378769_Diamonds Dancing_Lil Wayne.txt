23 ContributorsDiamonds Dancing Lyrics
Smoking on strong, money long, we don't reason
Probably with my niggas, but my bitch Polynesian
Met this bad little broad, she was curvy
Sipped out in the middle of the day, I started early
Balling in the middle of the drought, we ain't worried
Middle finger up to the judge and I'm smirking
Bring your squad cause you know my gang with me
Drop the top on the car, let the tints breathe
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds snatching
Michael Myers, Norman Bates, Charles Manson
Commas, commas, commas, commas, commas cashing
We fight time and time and time and time and time and time
Again

I told my plug "You know what I need
From you when I get on
Yeah, uh
Two bricks, a triple beam and a foam
So I can make a storm like I usually do"

Banging with my friends, nigga that's Soo-woo
Calicoe spit like a Uzi do
You'll be so hard to identify when you're
Hit up from your arms to your corns and still bleeding
All my niggas children of the corn like Stephen
King - I met this broad she was curvy
Bitch started twerking when them whips start urr-ing
Getting money since 'Got Money'
And if you real you could vouch for me
I still need my Block Is Hot money
I ain't fucking with these pussies like they got something
Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping
You might also like
I told my plug "You know what I need
From you when I get on
Yeah
Two bricks, a triple beam and a foam
So I can make a storm like I usually do"

Bad bitch on my arm that's my new lil boo
Pussy be so warm and it's Juicy Fruit
Trampoline on this dick, I got her twat jumping
Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping
Vaseline on a brick in case the cops coming
Trafficking with the work in her bra for me
Wearing lingerie and heels round the house for me
Wearing lingerie and heels round the house for me
All these bitches try'na chill then thaw out for me
Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping
Got the block

We sipping that dirty
We sipping that dirty
We sipping that dirty
We sipping that dirty, you know
Yeah
This Gat pointed at your nose, nigga
That vest canâ€™t save your soul, no
We sipping that dirty, yeah

Haven't even heard from you
You left the kids by they self
They haven't even heard from you
We put your wig on the shelf

They haven't even heard from you, now they gotta search for you
We unstable, yeah
It ain't looking too good for you, too good for you
You're ungrateful, yeah
That's why I switched label, yeah
I gotta live for myself,  yeah

Look at all the shit I gave you
