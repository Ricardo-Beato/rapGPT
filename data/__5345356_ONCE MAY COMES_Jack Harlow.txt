21 ContributorsONCE MAY COMES Lyrics
If you, if you wondering what may come from it
Once May comes, then we graduate for the summer
'Til then, lock-in, watch the cake come from it, uh
Pray to God we break one hundred, ayy
Once you get it poppin', watch the hate come from it, uh
Chicks I used to chase come from it
I can ask my bro, he gon' stay one hundred with me, uh
I know what they talkin' 'bout now
And my brodie he got principles, don't often back down
And I think they gon' tell me when I'm off the track now
But as for right now, man, I'm off in this bitch, uh
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, ayy
We don't often get missed, uh
At least not how we used to in the old days
Pete Rock what we groove to and they all say

You could put a milli' on us, uh
You could put a milli' on us
I can keep it really honest
They fuck with you, but see they really on us
You could put a milli' on us

If you, if you wondering what may come from it
Once May comes, then we graduate for the summer
'Til then, lock-in, watch the cake come from it, uh
Pray to God we break one hundred, ayy
Once you get it poppin', watch the hate come from it, uh
Chicks I used to chase come from it
I can ask my bro, he gon' stay one hundred with me, uh
I know what they talkin' 'bout now
And my brodie he got principles, don't often back down
And I think they gon' tell me when I'm off the track now
But as for right now, man, I'm off in this bitch, uh
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, ayy
We don't often get missed, uh
At least not how we used to in the old days

You could put a milli' on us

You could put a milli' on us, uh
You could put a milli' on us
I can keep it really honest
They fuck with you, but see they really on usEmbed
