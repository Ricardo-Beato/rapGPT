Tell that girl what she wanna hear (Ah)

The rap game boring (Chyeah)
There's no comp, wake me up, I'm snorin' (Chyeah)
6 rings on you can call me Rob Horry (Huh?)
Still busting bricks down, Zone 6 quarry (Huh?)
Told your girl my video shoot was in the morning (Gucci, Gucci)
Shawty bring me out like she doing a performance (Gucci)
Your lil darling keeps on calling (Huh?)
Baby, you can call but don't call that often! (Well, damn!)
I'm so high I can see Stone Mountain (Chyeah)
Futuristic ride, Gucci ridin' like the Jetsons (What?)
Baby, no questions, let's just exit (Huh?)
Say she got a man but the nigga ain't present (Wow)
Gucci got sensitivity, Ralph Tresvant (Yes)
It's gon' be okay, baby girl, just suck it (Yeahh)
Gucci got sensitivity, Ralph Tresvant (Huh?)
It's gon' be okay, baby-boo, just suck it

Lil mama lookin' at me like I'm a piece of chicken (Choosin')
Like I'm finger-lickin' good
Like I come with fries and biscuits (Chewy)
Baby wanna kick it
I walked up to lil mama, asked her "What's up with them digits?" (Chyeah)
"What's up with them digits?" (Yeah)
Baby choosing me, shawty recognize the swagger
Let her snort it off a saucer, I can't help that she a snorter
I'm a baller, I got powder
Told your girl jump in the shower (Chyeah)
I got money, I got power
Features 20 thousand dollars (Yeahh)
I stay fresh to death
I'm a stylist, I'm a star, cuz I dress myself (Well, damn!)
Gucci hat, Gucci loafers, Gucci bags and belt (Gucci, Gucci)
Man, it's Gucci Mane LaFlare and ain't no extras left
Tell that girl what she wanna hear (Ah)

Imma put some flavor in her ear
And tell your girl what she wanna hear (Ah)

Imma tell you just like Zay'll tell you (Zay)
Baby girl, better do what I tell you (Yeah)
Imma tell you like my nigga Lodi say (Lodi)
"If you ain't makin' money don't come this way" (Biatch)
Imma tell you like my nigga Big Jay (Jizzle)
Jay'll tell you "I ain't trickin' every day" (Nah)
Imma tell you like my slick partner Quay (Quzzo)
"I'm too fresh for a hoe to come this way" (Well, damn!)
Imma tell you like my nigga John Boy (What's up, JB?)
"We gon' hit the club, we gon' have some fun, boy"
Imma tell you like Gucci tell a hoe
"I smell you, I can smell a rat, hoe" (Gucci!)
