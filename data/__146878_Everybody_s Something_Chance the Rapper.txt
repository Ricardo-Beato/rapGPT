181 ContributorsEverybodyâ€™s Something Lyrics
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick
(On the mic like it's a dick)
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit (The shit)
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep

What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why God phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter, wonder if I would follow Him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot of off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
You know what I mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck, bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News"
Booyaka buckle up, motherfuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool
You might also like
Nice to see you, Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass

Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
That's right
Nobody's nothing, nobody's nothing (Right? Igh)
I know you're right

I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off-white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but my hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon-toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe
Nice to see you, Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass

Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance, not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block underarms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas, hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously, they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us, we tryna get lucky, doper than Lucky
You're ending happy, that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating, shit come hot, but y'all still love me
Ugh, how Father Time a deadbeat? Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, igh

Everybody's somebody's everything, nigga
Nobody's nothing, nigga
Everybody's somebody's everything, nigga
Nobody's nothing at all
Wu-Tang
Everybody's somebody's everything
That's right
Nobody's nothing
I know you're right106Embed
