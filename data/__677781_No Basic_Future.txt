Zaytoven
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You gotta feel the pain of the kid in the ghetto
Our hearts of the ghetto, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta turn it up a notch for the city

I do the Maserati, no basic, no basic (Yeah)
Gotta get that money like the '80s and save it (Let's go)
We went through the struggle and waited and waited (Ain't nothin')
I can't let not one of you betray me, betray me (Not one)
I get exhausted off that red 'til I say, "Oh, oh" (Woah, woah)
I get exhausted off the red, I don't need no more (That drank)
I promise I'ma blow the weave off this bitch, nigga (Off this bitch, nigga)
A million dollar, take a sneeze on a bitch nigga

Carbine 15, don't you take it personal
Shorty wanna swing by a nigga way, let's go (Shawty, swing my way)
Let's go (Shawty, swing my way)
California dreams, every single day, we live 'em
They gave me the game and I ran with it (I ran with it)
Took all the pain and I ran with it (I ran with it)
Took all the fame and I ran with it (I ran with it)
I took a few losses and ran with it (One hundred)
I go to shoppin', I'm tearful (One hundred)
Order that car and an Audemar (One hundred)
I'm reminiscin' 'bout my past, yeah (One hundred)
I gotta go get the cash, yeah (I swear)
Ten bale joints, I put a bird inside a Porsche (Freebandz)
She a bad bitch, I put that ass inside a Porsche (I swear)
Got some mad killers with me ready to swang that torch
Really, really, really, we some dope boys
You might also like
I do the Maserati, no basic, no basic (Yeah)
Gotta get that money like the '80s and save it (Let's go)
We went through the struggle and waited and waited (Ain't nothin')
I can't let not one of you betray me, betray me (Not one)
I get exhausted off that red 'til I say, "Oh, oh" (Woah, woah)
I get exhausted off the red, I don't need no more (That drank)
I promise I'ma blow the weave off this bitch, nigga (Off this bitch, nigga)
A million dollar, take a sneeze on a bitch nigga (Bitch)

A hundred round magazine, don't take it personal
We had some problems 'fore this rap shit, took 'em personal
You get so much money, your past start haunting you
So many foreign broads, and they all want that revenue
Hey, I keep a dope boy knot on me, I keep one on me, yeah
Rubber band banks, I fuck that bitch, she got one on me, yeah
Saucy, drippin' off me, got designer drippin' off me, yeah
Burn some dope up, roll some dope up, gotta smoke one, yeah (I swear)
I caught a jugg at the car dealer (What else?)
Paid it right there on the spot for her (What else?)
Maserati truck, woah, woah (Wow)
Fucking thotties is a no-no (Wow)
Real nigga, do it anyway (Real one)
Pop a pill, she a throwaway (A real one)
Crack a seal, then pour away (Pour it up)
Fuck around, take the doors away
I do the Maserati, no basic, no basic (Yeah)
Gotta get that money like the '80s and save it (Let's go)
We went through the struggle and waited and waited (Ain't nothin')
I can't let not one of you betray me, betray me (Not one)
I get exhausted off that red 'til I say, "Oh, oh" (Woah, woah)
I get exhausted off the red, I don't need no more (That drank)
I promise I'ma blow the weave off this bitch, nigga (Off this bitch, nigga)
A million dollar, take a sneeze on a bitch nigga (Bitch)
