69 ContributorsTha Shiznit Lyrics
That was Tha Dogg Pound here right on WBallz
187.4 on your FM dial
You're tuned in to the biggest balls of them all, DJ Sal T. Nuts
Ayy, don't forget about my homeboy Eazy Dick and The Jackoff Hour
That's happening at twelve o'clock tonight
Right now we got some new Snoop Doggy Dogg for that ass
This one is called "Tha Shiznit"
You're about to go downtown, bitch
Right here on the station that plays only platinum hits
That's 187.4 on your FM dial
If you're lickin', that's WBallz
Everybody's got to hear the shit
On WBallz, WBallz, WBallz
Poppin', stoppin', hoppin' like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross, ya know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut, retain myself
Think about the shit and I think it well
How can I makes my grip?
And how should I make that nigga straight slip?
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on a
'Nother mission, wishin' upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo, no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
'Til the next episode
I make money and I really don't love hoes
Tell you the truth, I swoop in the coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops
But now I make hits every single day
With that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut, motherfucker, 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
You might also like
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da

Boy, it's gettin' hot, yes, indeed it is
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I'm 'bout as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangster shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm finna fuck a bitch, what's her name? It's Luke
You tried to see me on the TV, you'se a B.G
D-O-double-G, yes, I'm a OG
You can't see my homie Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say?
Gotta take a trip to the M-I-A
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You can't see the D-O-double-G 'cause that be me
I'm servin' 'em, swervin' in the coupe
The Lexus flexes from Long Beach to Texas
Sexist hoes, they wanna get with this
'Cause the Snoop Dogg is the shit, biatch
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da

Uh, I'm somewhat brain boggled
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, habit, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop Doggy, I got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket low
Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga, Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut like I told your ass
Give me the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck him give me the ass
'Cause they know about the shit that we be goin' through
And they know about the shit that I be puttin' up
And they be knowin' 'bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic
'Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay, and plizzay
With D-O-double-Gizzay the fly human being, seein'
No, I'm not European, bein' all I can
When I put the motherfuckin' mic in my hand, and
You don't understand what I'm kickin'
'Cause Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me, 'cause I do you like you wanna be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three, two, one, um
Dum, diddy-dum, here I come
With the gat, and the guitar will strum, um
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slippin', I'ma catch you then I'll peel your cap
Snap back, relax
Ya bet' not be slippin' with them Ds on that '83 Cadillac
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
Gs up, hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da26Embed
