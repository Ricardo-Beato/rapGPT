19 ContributorsStrange Things Lyrics
She say she won't drink her some lean
Do you know lean make you do strange things
Girl you know I love to do strange things
I love to do strange things
I love to do it, F-R-F-R, for real I love it
Slow down, baby girl slow it down
No weed baby, roll it around
Earn you a brand new coupe today

You can still ask Kunte
Now you flexin' just like Lex Luger bae
I'm gone off lean, I'm a real lean mean
If this is a dream, let's get it
Oh, oh, baby
My diamonds in the booth just shakin'
Ain't got no time to starve 'cause all my homies done take it
And I'm so tired of hearing 'bout prison, I really hope I make it
Free Unfoonk, free my nigga Haze
Know the streets begging for them
This world really gay, good leave young
Free TayTay, let's get it

She say she won't drink her some lean
Do you know lean make you do strange things
Girl you know I love to do strange things
I love to do strange things
I love to do it, F-R-F-R, for real I love it
Slow down, baby girl slow it down
No weed baby, roll it around
Earn you a brand new coupe today

AK-47, that's a long horn
Hold a hundred grams inside my long johns
Brown Tru's today with these Air Force ones
Two fifty shots, these not Air Force ones
Hundred thousand ones off in DOA (Guwop)
I don't know your name but I will bust your brain
I don't know your name, but I'll fuck your main dame
Hit her from the back, and chain swing
Ooh, who are you, what the fuck it do?
Soo-Crew, suwoop, it ain't nothing blue
I'm chopping my Reeses to pieces
I'm fucking these rich niggas nieces
I put on my Lebron South Beaches
Then hop off in that foreign feature

She say she won't drink her some lean
Do you know lean make you do strange things
Girl you know I love to do strange things
I love to do strange things
I love to do it, F-R-F-R, for real I love it
Slow down, baby girl slow it down
No weed baby, roll it around
Earn you a brand new coupe today
Baby girl slow it down, slow down
Baby girl slow it down, slow down
Baby girl slow it down
Baby girl slow it down19Embed
