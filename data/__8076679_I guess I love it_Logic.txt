I snatched the mic off LL's arm and strangled Canibus with it
Sit with the body for seven days and just smoke cannabis with it
I told Logic, logically, I shouldn't be on this with him
'Cause I'm way too disrespectful and I was just bein' honest with him
The black sheep, mhm, and the GOAT, mhm
Michael Jordan, mhm, Manigault, mhm
Before that ship sails, I tip scales and man the boat
Fish scale weigh ten whales and, um, handle dope
Kyrie and the pope, mhm, poetic justice
2Pac, Maya Angelou, let us deconstruct it
Take the ass shots out of hip-hop and, um, reconstruct it
Give me all Slick Rick chains and Rakim's beeper buzzin'
Give me the velour sweatsuit on Stillmatic and "Ether" bustin'
Give me the Annie sample on "Hard Knock Life" and the deep discussions
That Malcolm had with Cassius Clay, Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown
I'm them now, especially when the hotel lights get dimmed down in Miami

Woah, shit
Logic
Logically, chronically, sonically (You, you, you, you, you, haha)

Ayy, I could give a fuck about this rap shit, homie
Logic finally out the deal, but this shit feel phony
Kind of feel like I'm back in the basement again
I make a masterpiece easy like I'm tracin' it in
Life's a trip though
Cash is dead, I took my money to the crib though
Blast the feds and now I'm reloadin' the clip though
Hahahaha, alright, oh my God, sippin' La Tâche, feelin' posh
Flow so ill, that shit was born in a triage
I got more tracks than heroin addicts
When my son goes to sleep, he uses his sound machine
But as a child, through my teens, all I heard was automatics
That was just the lifestyle, no way you could combat it
They said I couldn't, said I won't
I think I'm rappin' like I don't give a fuck 'cause I don't
Got a million platinum plaques and billions in streams
I used to think this shit was the definition of dreams
Now I understand that none of that is what it seems
It won't fulfill you, but it'll fill you full up of emptiness
If that's the only reason that you doin' it
Well, I did it and I'm still here doin' it
I guess I love it, ha

Livin' how we livin', not at all for you
Finally on my feet, y'all, been on the beach, y'all
Lookin' at the sky and the stars above
Just me and my fleet, y'all, we'll defeat y'all
Livin' how we livin', not at all for you
Finally on my feet, y'all, been on the beach, y'all
