Yeah
Yeah, yeah
A little louder
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
And if by chance this is my grand finale
Bury me in Allegheny County, it's the
The most hated, so faded that I'm bow-legged
Don't bathe, gross gang, smell like old Lo Mein, shit
The flow dangerous, make you wanna do the wave
Throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation
The most strangest, master of the ceremonies
A fifth of Stoli then itâ€™s only Cher and Moby karaoke
My bitch a shooter, call her Annie Oakley
Get you for a pair of Kobe's, just got out on probation
And no famous friends for me, just old faces
I only go places wasted like I'm Joe Namath
Not a king, I'm no David, music, I'm a crackhead
No hobbies and recreation, don't even know my address
Self-medicate, self-education
Rick Rubin showed me transcendental meditation

Let us have a grand finale
The world will be just fine without me
The clown got a smile on his face
Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang
Are you ready for the fireworks?
It was a silent night 'til the fireworks

Yeah, okay, I
I fear nothin' on this odyssey of dark roads
God lives in my dog's soul, the devil in his dog bowl
We are the prophets, Jesus was a poor sport
He booted Nostradamus, turned water into wine
But he loved the gin and tonic, had skeletons in his closet
Even God will one day be forgotten
And recently I been feelin', I been feelin' like
It'd be really nice to get to sit with Mickey Weiss
Shoot the shit 'bout life, he'd be pissed I'm sniffin' white
Never got to see me grow up, how long it take to live a life?
I'm a bit surprised that I'm even still alive
Mixin' uppers and downers practically suicide
My old Jewish mind, REMember music, you'll be fine
And I make my own beats now, if you behind
Hallucination's how I use my mind
Who am I?
Let us have a grand finale
The world will be just fine without me
The clown got a smile on his face
Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang
Are you ready for the fireworks?
It was a silent night 'til the fireworks26Embed
