(Quaranta)
We doin' this even without a record deal
Half the shit I say can't be understood by executives
I'm from that crack rock
Pawn your grandma wedding ring
So what the fuck they gon' tell me 'bout anything
Strap up, nigga, get yo boots on tight
I'm from back when Snoop called Luke a 'Frisco dyke
Made moves and went left, and you went right
Niggas wanna be hot 'til they souls on ice
Long as I got the rent, you can't tell me shit
You ain't got it, put you out like Hannibal Buress
Got it all fucked up thinking I won't flourish
'Fore my family sitting starved, you be all malnourished

My raps like Tetris
Bars keep fallin', gotta know whеre to place 'em
Smokе with Dave Chappelle, the nigga think I laced him
Knew it was the pack
He started talkin' 'bout spaceships
I write like, it's the only thing I'm good at
Took yo' bitch shopping, it was nothin' to that
Nah, I ain't gon' say that, nah, I ain't gon' do that
But the bitch you with, blew my muffin top blue back
Sit with thoughts like a toad on a stone
Try to put my finger in her like a rotary phone
If I take her for a spin, she would never call home
Put her hand behind her own head like Karl Malone
You might also like
I'm totally fuckin' awesome
Step to the side like Iverson crossed Jordan
Gimme my portion or end wit' extortion
Might stab a nigga if you come between my crawfish
Put the squeeze on you like a corset, not in my final form yet
So watch me metamorphis'
Spittin' on porches, rappin' for a mortgage
For a bowl of porridge I put you into orbit
My nigga did a bid, just got home with a rack
Last time he heard me spittin', he had a Nautica jacket
But he still packin'
God gave him a hat trick
When his ass got out, LeBron suddenly on the Mavericks
I was gon' stop ya, but when I heard this beat I started countin' up my car fare
The way I get product' and beats this good this shit is not fair
Sorta make you think but this ain't like a high chair
Ya kids gotta eat, just a bought a drill from Sears and some patio seats (Ha!)
Ya kids gotta eat, just a bought a drill from Sears and some patio seats (Haha)

Ya kids gotta eat (Ya kids gotta eat)
Ya kids gotta eat
And some patio seatsEmbed
