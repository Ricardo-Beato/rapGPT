8 ContributorsGo Harder Than Yall Lyrics
Uh, as the blunt slowly burns
I pass through Cleveland the point of no return
And if you make it out alive, don't return
Let me fly free, man, fuck a urn
Smoke my ashes, taste my dust
This shit was really easy like fuckin' two sluts
And this money on my mind so I ain't fucked in two months
And when it comes down to a bitch, I don't be carin' too much (Swamp Izzo)
Where ever ya'll at, we above that
Lord knows I hope the Feds bring my plug back
ROC Crew, TJ said, what's poppin', 5ive?
And they say money talks, well then my tongue is tied

Oh, and I'll just beat you like an instrumental
We go harder than y'all
And we go farther than y'all (Ha)

I swear I hate ya'll, ya'll nigga act like felines
Talkin' bout your flow sick, boy, that means my shit dyin'
Treat you like my old woman, beat you like you stole somethin'
Niggas actin' like they take when they ain't never stole nothin' (Haha)
And we sittin' at the top and I ain't comin' down
I ain't comin' down
No sounds when I come around
When I come around
You might also like
Oh, and I'll just beat you like an instrumental
We go harder than y'all
And we go farther than y'all
Oh, and I'll just beat you like an instrumental
We go harder than y'all
And we go farther than y'all
Thugger (Hoodrich, nigga)

Your bitch, I gotta collar like a leash and she's a tit
Now my ROC Crew buddy my weed is, my drank is muddy
My bitch is slutty
I fuck them hoes and hand 'em to ROC Crew buddy
I leave out the side and come back in, them bitches fuckin' on them
And we sittin' at the top of y'all niggas
Fuck, sling, sellin', never cop with y'all niggas
So I aim to go hard and I ain't stoppin' y'all
Even them bitches that we fuckin', they on top of y'all

Oh, and I'll just beat you like an instrumental
We go harder than y'all
And we go farther than y'all (I said, hold up)
(I said, I said)
And I'll just beat you like an instrumental
We go harder than y'all, yeah
And we go farther than y'all, yeah1Embed
