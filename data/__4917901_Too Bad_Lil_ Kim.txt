I swear I don't wanna win it, I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go, but I really wanna stay

He said, "Shorty, you should go and bend it over for me
Bust it down, go and spread it open for me
'Cause the gang up in here, you know it's too bad
When the gang up in here, you know we doing bad"
I'ma shake it on him, shake it all around like a hula hoop
And now he wanna take me to Hawaii
And you know I'ma go, go and get it
Tom Brady, I'ma throw it, throw it back
Diamonds dripping all over me
But the money keep calling me
And I know it's too bad for you niggas that we winning
Even if I go vegan, I'm still getting to the chicken

And I really wanna smoke, I really wanna dance
I just really wanna drink, I don't take my pain away
I just wanna drip and drown in it (Drown in it, drown in it)
I just wanna drip and drown in it (Drown in it, drown in it)

I'ma always be good 'cause the bitch is too bad
Got a new Birkin bag 'cause we 22 stacks
Bitches wanna ride a wave like a nigga durag
My ex texts me that he miss me, tell that nigga "Too bad"
Nigga, too bad
I know I'm the best you ever had, shorty
Like a quarterback, he focus on the pass, shorty
Gotta reminisce on how I used to grab his dick and French kiss it
Tried to roll you up, but you was big flippin'
Just be out here, out here, like your friends
Ain't no loving lost because I'm winning
And these diamonds limping like a pimp
Baby, endless
Too bad for you niggas, it's too bad for you niggas
It's too bad for you niggas, it's too bad for you niggas
I swear I don't wanna win it, I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go, but I really wanna stay
And I really wanna smoke, I really wanna dance
I just really wanna drink, I don't take my pain away
I just wanna drip and drown in it (Drown in it, drown in it)
I just wanna drip and drown in it (Drown in it, drown in it)
I just wanna drip and drown in it (Drown in it, drown in it)
I just wanna drip and drown in it, drown in it, drown in it
I just really wanna, woah, I just1Embed
