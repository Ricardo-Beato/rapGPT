I am so loud that you can smell me
Clear packs on the arm yeah you smell me
I smoke so loud that you can smell me
Hercules strong pack I know you smell me
Smell me (x4)
(M's)
I smoke so loud that you can smell me
I am so loud that you can smell me

I smoke so loud
You might can sell me
I smell loud you can't help me
Da Keyshia Cole it make me day dream
Foreign bitches they do anything
Smoking on that Cali green
Shouts out to my Migo team
No Twinkie but they bout that cream
Double cup me up and pour the lean
Pocket cashed out like slot machine
Smelling like a junkie on the street
My lap it smell like grilled junkie

I am so loud that you can smell me
Clear packs on the arm yeah you smell me
I smoke so loud that you can smell me
Hercules strong pack I know you smell me
Smell me (x4)
(M's)
I smoke so loud that you can smell me
I am so loud that you can smell me
You might also like
You smell that shit, who got that shit?
Yeah that me, you can smell me
This jewelery on me yeah it got my neck heavy
Yeah you can weigh me on a triple beam
I take a shower but I don't throw my cologne on
I smell so loud cause DJ threw that Young Dro on
And I am balling on you niggas Steve Harvey
Got me juugin' call me two face Harvey
Rollin' blunts not  give me Marley
And I got kush and purp and iCarly
Chevrolet, Bugatti's and Maserati's
I be running with money like in Monopoly

I am so loud that you can smell me
Clear packs on the arm yeah you smell me
I smoke so loud that you can smell me
Hercules strong pack I know you smell me
Smell me (x4)
(M's)
I smoke so loud that you can smell me
I am so loud that you can smell me1Embed
