29 ContributorsI Can’t Lyrics
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Let me just say this out the gate:
I'm the nigga everybody love to hate
I'm the hustler every stripper wanna date
But I just wanna cut a check 'cause I can't wait
Most of these rappers, groupies and I can't relate
Stay in line 'fore this chopper get you scraped
I got a problem, I'ma say it to your face
And fuck your bottom, I'ma shoot you in your face

They want me to apologize, but I can't
You can talk about homicides, but I can't
You pillow-talking to these bitches, but I can't
You niggas snitchin' on your partners, but I can't
You let a nigga disrespect you, but I can't
You might can turn the other cheek, but I can't
You suckers rockin' fake jewelry, but I can't
I know they wait for me to fall, but I can't

Oh that's your girl? That's your world, I'm with her tonight
A rich nigga smilin' at you, It's so pearly white
It's the burr (burr burr burr) rockin' fur tonight
I'm Michael Kors to the floor, call me sir tonight
Think what you wanna think, but you can't break a bank, fool
Can't let a nigga go, she know I keep her bank roll
She wanna start a home with me, but I can't
She think that I'm her cup of tea, but I ain't
See, I'm the type to think his shit doesn't stink
The new ice scream “Master P,” without the tank
Fresh out the boat, but she's a freaky, not a saint
A stowaway, so I'ma make her walk the plank
You might also like
They want me to apologize, but I can't
You can talk about homicides, but I can't
You pillow-talking to these bitches, but I can't
You niggas snitchin' on your partners, but I can't
You let a nigga disrespect you, but I can't
You might can turn the other cheek, but I can't
You suckers rockin' fake jewelry, but I can't
I know they wait for me to fall, but I can't

I'm on that rich nigga shit, I drop some bread on that bitch
All these stones, man you'd think we're more than Fred in this bitch
I done shown this bitch so much, that I got scared of this bitch
She done seen so many mils I might go fed if she snitch
I need a mistress, the type to give me head 'til she sick
I told her, "please stop sucking on me," I was begging the bitch
I was worth like half a million when I came in this shit
I'm a eight figure nigga now, I'm trained for this shit
Back to all these rocks on me, I look like Hov and Dame in this bitch
My life's a documentary, I feel like Game in this shit
So many of my partners turned state I'm so ashamed of my clique
But I can't never be a snitch, I'm too well-trained for this shit

They want me to apologize, but I can't
You can talk about homicides, but I can't
You pillow-talking to these bitches, but I can't
You niggas snitchin' on your partners, but I can't
You let a nigga disrespect you, but I can't
You might can turn the other cheek, but I can't
You suckers rockin' fake jewelry, but I can't
I know they wait for me to fall, but I can'tEmbed
