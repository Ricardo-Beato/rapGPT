(Kill, kill, kill...)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, duh-da-da-da-da
(Kill, kill, kill...)
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, dum
Dahh-dum, dahh-dum, dumm
(Kill, kill, kill...)

(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He'll) Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit, he will
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He'll) Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit, he will
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He'll) Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit, he will
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville

I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat (Aahh!)
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral

(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He'll) Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit, he will
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He'll) Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit, he will
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (Still!)
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit, he gets killed (Killed!)
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville (Ville!)
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still (Still!)
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill (Hill!)
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot (Shoot!)
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too (Too!)
That's the mentality here (Here!), that's the reality here (Here!)
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (Huh?!)
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (Here!)
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year? (Year!)
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen (Happen!), when a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it; goddammit, he meant it when he told you
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He'll) Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit, he will
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
(He'll) Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit, he will
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville
