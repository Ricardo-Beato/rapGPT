Fuck your dead homies, run your bread, homie
Got some lead for me, I'm on Artesia
Parked in my Bimmer, bumping my own shit
I'm focused, they stuck on that old shit
Living for that True Religion is broke shit
I could spend that on a MAC with a long clip
Fly in that Benz, but you hide in that Focus
My nigga, just focus, I'm trying to paint you a picture
We stuck in the moment
My burner get stuck if I shoot it too much
So a nigga resorted to doming
That's somebody's son, but a war to be won
Baby, either go hunt or be hunted
We crabs in a bucket
He called me a crab, so I shot him in front of the Douglas
I cannot be fucked with, we thuggin' in public

Been touring, whip foreign, coupe crashing
Still banging 2 Naughty 2 Nasty
Still "fuck the police," they won't catch me

Go hard 'til Goyard on my baggage

I feel like "Fuck Versace", they raping niggas' pockets
And we don't get acknowledged, just thank me for the profit
A prophet just like Moses, and Moses looked like Shaka
Zulu, my .44 loaded, I'm aiming at Nirvana (Nirvana)
My bitch look like Madonna ('Donna), they staring at Katana
Waiter still ain't brought the chopsticks, should've brought the chopper (Whoo)
Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer
But he looking at me crazy when we pull up to the projects

See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray, Jehovah, lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions, fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
Life ain't always what it seems, so, please (Hey)

I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, it gets shady
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson, or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the D-low, and he know

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me

Same club with the same champagne
Backwoods, tryna burn your brain
With a broke-ass nigga in the CarMax Range
You ain't nothing but a vivrant thing
Ass too thick for your 5'10" frame
Want to spend all night in your nine lives?
Get to purring when that liquor get to burning
Get it cracking, why you acting like a virgin?
Where it come from—mama or the surgeon?
You paid for it? Did you pray for it? Get twerking
And a nigga gotta sit and wait for it, is it worth it?
Why I ask when I already know?
Don't mind me, mind already gone
Nigga better not keep calling your phone
Have my dogs in the yard at his home

I might be wrong, might be guilty
You might be right, oh (This time)
You tried to warn me, swore it would kill me
I sacrificed
Die to the world, I took the money (Wouldn't you?)
So for my life
Couldn't sleep at night—should've seen the crib, though
So fucking nice

Speaking on the unjust way the justice system is justifying crimes against our kind
Justice is supposed to be blind, but continue to cross color lines
"Hands up, don't shoot?" You shot
"Stand your ground?" Blacks don't own no ground to stand on, so we stand on our words.
"Black and hooded" is the official probable cause for cops to keep weapons drawn
"I can't breathe" through the chokeholds and gunsmoke
These realities drift in the pen to inform Black boys and men of the dangers outside their doors
Slain in society by sworn protectors, protected by their peers, grand juries full of friends; no charges brought against them
They kill and arrest us, transgress and oppress us

Damn, cuz
It don't even matter. You can start from the beginning...

Heaven or Hell, boy; freedom or jail, boy
A Jansport bag full of shit I could sell for—
The high or the low, boy, just me and my homeboys
The police kill us, so we made up our own laws
Been fighting this long war, it's shells in this shore sand
Still young, but a grown man, could tell by my stature
Stacking money and problems as I wait for the Rapture
Death never been no threat, I be chilling, relaxing
Everybody bleed

I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to Heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my mama proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one

When I was in seventh grade, my grandfather taught me, "Don't get caught loving the streets, 'cause they never gon' love you back." But I feel like it's all we got, so it's all we really do love. At the end of the day, I feel like the problem is the people that control it don't really come from there. So they can't do nothing but, you know, look down on us. We look up at them, we see somebody that could help; they look at us, and all they see is a nigga. But it don't really matter anyway. We all gon' die one day, man. One day.

Do doves cry when a Black man die, or do we croak with crows?
The young catch gunshots, the old catch the Holy Ghost
Ho, I love not, I never seen no pot of gold
Just bar windows and six-fours with no switches
Was broke with no bitches; she love me, though
You'll kill me if it make you richer, what you screaming you my brother for?
Heart is where the hatred is, the brain'll stain the love below
And life is what you make it, so I'm making money for my folks

I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to Heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my mama proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To do it like nobody has ever done

When most people look at a person who does what I do, they look at us with these preconceived notions, as if it's a set way for us all to be. But we all people at the end of the day, so I wonder why we don't treat each other like it. You looking at a person, telling them that they story don't matter, really, no better than me walking down the street tryna shoot at somebody, 'cause all we got is these dreams, man, and y'all ain't never had to not have nothing. And that's the last thing you want for anybody is to not really have nothing at all.
I been through Hell and back, I seen my mama cry
Seen my father hit the crack, then hit the set to flip a sack
I done seen my homies die, then went on rides to kill 'em back
So how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that?
We live for they amusement, like they view us from behind the glass
No matter what we grow into, we never gon' escape our past
So in this cage they made for me, exactly where you find me at
Whether it's my time to leave or not, I never turn my back

I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to Heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my mama proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one

LaVish what they call me, and I’m often hated
I ain’t the best yet, won’t stop until the greatest
Yeah my bud is shining like a flashlight
And yeah we can collab for a flat price
And I’m rolling in a Polo, Marco

They only fucking with the rapper if the rapper rich
Or got a platinum hit
A chain or two
Seem the music interchangeable
Raging bull, what you headed for?
Heaven doors, or hell below

How you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I lay
So can you do me a favor, smile for me?

I know they wanna see me fall, I know they fraudulent, I know
I know they hoping that it's right back to the ghettos I go
I know my pigment is not that of a businessmen
I know they think I'm ignorant, I'm fucking up my privilege
I know that money come and go so money not my motive no mo’
I made enough to know I'll never make enough for my soul
I turned my back on my friends
I turned my back on my home
I left the streets where I've grown
To chase the yellow brick road
I heard they paved it with gold, I turned around and seen they pissed on it
Just like me
But that's alright because my soul burning, please set me free
I hope to see you in another life time, mines just not for me

And you just think
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
When life gets hard
And you can’t breathe
You wanna end it all
Smile for me

How you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I pray
So could you do me a favor, smile for me?

I don't love you, you don't love me, we should give it up
Wish I felt your body without me getting my feeling's touched
People tell me I'm too young and I should live it up
How could you not feel that? These freaks wanna give it up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Don't say you feel my pain cause I don't even feel myself
Blood rushing through my brain, sometimes I wanna kill myself
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Motion of the ocean waves capsize me, baptize my frame
Salt water inside my wounds, still don't know who to blame
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up

Alright, alright, alright

Man I love my bitches
Man they photogenic
Snatched em straight up out they Richardson mag they do my dishes
Man I love this Cripping
Man my homies with it
All these murders they ain't got enough ambulances with ‘em
I ain't paying homage to nobody with no bodies
I don't care 'bout yo Ferrari I’ll snatch you out that Bentley
Was cramming into Civics 'round 2010ish
Piled in the studio when not a nigga would listen

Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Hands up baby don't you see this big nine
Screamin' fuck the world like that shit mine

Player shit player made
I’m stuck in my player ways
I just made a play today
She gave me some play today
My Jordan was layaway
I caught me a fade a day
Around where Janaya stay
My 40 go dumb in a major way
I come from the game where they pay to play
These rappers extorted like everyday
That Yankee I'm sporting like every day
Just played me a show they paid 80k
I put it away for a rainy day
You never know when you gon catch a case
You never know when you gon catch an opp

Big timer like Manny and Baby
Don't play with that man cause he crazy
With Demon and Ocho from Bompton
They stomping out niggas like Stacy
The radio never gon play me
I'll quit if my label don't pay me
I'll run up in there with my gun in the air screaming give me the shit you owe Jay Z
Bandana like Jayo from Daygo’s
My temper depend how my day go
My girl do whatever I say so
She ain't got no reason to say no
I ain't wish for nothing but hood rich
You ain't seen how grimey my hood get
I been on some up to no good shit
You on that Cuba from Boyz N da Hood shit
I go down to Cuba and find me a plug
Sick of these rappers not selling no drugs
Sick of this industry playing these games
Sick of my enemies saying my name
Harder than niggas since Hollister nigga
I’ll body a nigga for saying I can't
You should have known I go hard in the paint
You should have known ain't no stopping my wave
Big time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Big time, time, time, time, time, time, time

Next time on Poppy street
Hello? Hello? Is anybody there?7Embed
I load the .44, then paint the Van Gogh
She rang the front door, she came commando
She came and rambled, I came and rolled over
No time for conversations, cold shoulders
Out of my mind, she off the red wine
She woozy, bitch bougie, straight from Dubai
She love the hip hop and love my slick talk
Gave head, then begged the boy to crip walk
I write the James Joyce, don't need the Rolls Royce
I need the straitjacket, finna go batshit
Sick of these rappers stealin' my swagger
Tryna run with the penmanship practiced
Gangsta gone Gatsby, fades with no lotion
Get this shit cracking, crack his jaw open
Crack in my system, Daddy loved smokin'
Like he loved smokin' niggas, no jokin'

Everybody get a little bit crazy
Seems like you've been feeling that lately
Everybody get a little bit lonely

Let me tell you 'bout when a nigga went loco
Ace hotel, should've stayed at the Soho
Housekeepin' keep knockin' on my door though
Don't she know I'm starin' in the mirror with a .44?
Tryna get my head straight, she tryna get the bed straight
No room to think, kaboom on the sink

Ugh, me tienes harta (Pinche baboso abre los ojos)
¿Quién te crees, eh? ¿El muy chingón? (Date cuenta de lo que tienes)
Tú no eres nadie (Ya no eres niño)
Todo lo que quieres hacer te sale mal (You're a grown-ass motherfuckin' man)
Eres un estúpido, no sabes nada

I'm in the black Benz speedin' with my black skin gleamin'
Out the window, tints low
Baby, come and see 'em where the rent low
Been gone, I don't need a shrink, I need a hit song
Tryna show the world a nigga tweakin'
Been a schizo crip though, off of 65th, though
When you're by the killer, I ain't aimin' when the shit blow
Jumpin' through your window, finna hit a lick mode
Thuggin' since the flip phone, don't be who I flip on
We all waste away, what are you lookin' for?
We all waste away, what do you got in store?
We all waste away 'cause I can't take much more
We all waste away, rather be lost and poor
What my pastor say? Some shit that I don't believe
What my master say? Nigga, you won't be free
Until you pass away, razor on my sleeve
Tryna compensate, this pain, it run so deep
"But you a star," they say, "You mean so much to me
Mean so much to me"10Embed
This is for my future baby mama
Hope your skin is black as midnight, I'll take you out that Honda
I can put you in a Benz, I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless
Our father art in heaven as I pray for new McLarens
Pray the police don't come blow me down 'cause of my complexion
Everybody think they know me now 'cause I'm chicken-checkin'
Negro, you are not my homie, how dare you think it's different?
Boy, you trippin'

Gas break and dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah, I stacked that past the ceiling

Prison system broken, racial war commotion
Until the president get ashy, Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office
Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started

So far from my past misfortune
No sleepin', late nights, no eatin'
Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona, I was 'round that corner
Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down Sawyer
When we slide, you won't see morning
Another story of a young Black man
Tryna make it up out that jam, Goddamn
Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans
If you hatin', don't shake my hand
Take it easy, homie
Reminiscin' sitting in that Benz
Of the 22 bus stop way back when
With the .22, 5 shot eyes on scan
For the click, clack, clap
Or the boop, bop, bam, cuz

It's funny, I was going crazy not too long ago
Women problems every morning like the Maury show
Swimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread from the sharks
Make me wanna put the hammer to my head
At the park politickin' with the kids
Tryna get 'em on a straight path, got the lames mad
Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation, conversations, what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss
Wanna be the boss? Then you gotta pay the cost
Learned it from the Dogg, I'm from Long Beach
That's the city where the skinny carry strong heat

Where I'm from we don't go to police
Where I'm from we don't run, we just roll with the heat
I'm the back of the bus, take a seat
Take a ride on my side where we die in the street
And the cops don't come for some weeks
No, the cops don't come for some weeks
Riding in a drop top, sun where I think
Might get JFK'd, hope not I pray if
If so, ain't no thang to a G
I feel just like Snoop on Andre Day
I run North Side of the beach
Run these streets like Ali Bomaye
I'm Lou' Bourgeois on the beat
Best bet, try not to compete

Paid a pretty penny for my peace of mind
Never need a girl to love me, I just need 'em fine
On Parisian time, don't be trippin' on a text back
In another world, Covergirl, but her chest flat
Two page spread in the CR
Think it was for Wang
Can't remember spring or fall, read it on a plane
Long flights playin' with my brain
Long nights, long summers we in Spain
Car color of La Haine
She getting naked under covers for the fame
She don't wanna be another what's-her-name
Brown skin, blonde brain, Etta James
Make it rain in the club
Don't you dream of how it feel to be in love?
What, you drinking? Need a buzz?
Don't drown in the brown, just drown in the sound

Crabs in a bucket

Crabs in a bucket
Wanna see you at the bottom, don't you love it?
When they're hatin' so you hit 'em with the encore
Sendin' shots, but you at the top floor
Let 'em pop shit, gimme some drums to go pop with
Need white women at the shows unconscious
If not that, then topless, earned all this
Get with that or get in the mosh pit
Where's your moxie? Ain't you from Poppy?
Young man, you not actin' too cocky
Prolly 'cause I'm feelin' like the world gon' crash
Read a hundred somethin' on the E-class dash
If I'm feelin' funny, guaranteed gon' flash
Cock back, blast, put 'em in a bag
Prolly gon' regret it in the retrospect
Got a lot of problems I ain't let go yet

Spend a lot of money on the CDG
Ain't I lookin' lovely on the TV screen?
Battle with the white man day by day
Feds takin' pictures doin' play by play
They don’t ever want to see the Black man eat
Nails in the Black man's hands and feet
Put him on a cross, so we put him on a chain
Lying to me, sayin' he don't look like me
Rollcage on the GT3
How a show on stage like a DVD?
Put me in the MoMA when it's over with

Sometimes you have to get all the—
All the crap out the way before you hit the good stuff and you're like, "Okay, I'm getting good stuff now"
But, um, uh, I had a b— I mean, the stuff I write about, what do I really write about?
I've got my weed songs and all my songs about my boy— uh, my ex-boyfriend, George
Songs about relationships that are kinda doomed from the start
You know, songs about when I fell in love and it went wrong
And I was so in love at the time, you know, I was like...
And I was with someone that I was in love with, you know what I mean? We were in love
You know what I mean? We were together, so
When it— and that's like a real drug, isn't it? So when it— when it didn't come together, I was just like...
You know? It really hurt
But I needed enough distance from it
So that it wasn't like raw emotion anymore
But not enough— enough distance that I'd forget
I'm quite a self-destructive person, so I guess
I guess I keep giving myself material
Raindrops on my windowsill
Longing for your nature's feel
Loved that song when we were kids
Now it makes me want you here
Sometimes, people disappear
Think that was my biggest fear
I should have protected you
Sometimes I wish it would rain
Sunshine, blue skies
Please go away
Sometimes I wish it would rain
The girl has found another and
Gone away
With her went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day
I stay locked up in my room

Pay me pronto, or it's no convo

I'm on a new level
I am too cultured and too ghetto
If you knew better you'd do better
But then you would know why the world on my penis

Homie, tell me where you come from, tell me what you bang
Ain't a damn thing funny, but we laughin' to the bank

What that accent 'bout? Southern California livin'
Daddy in and out of prison, ain't a father to my style

I been fucked since my early days

Propaganda, press pan the camera
Please don't look at me in my face
Everybody might see my pain
Off the rail, might off myself
Bored with life as I board this plane
Stewardess ask if I need help
Maybe, baby, what's your last name?
Hopefully it still ain't been changed
Somethin' 'bout ya make me not doubt ya
Awkward silence, my brain scream louder
Askin' when I'm gon' blast myself
Couple problems my cash can't help
Human issues, too strong for tissues
False bravado all masked by wealth

Move your body if you came here to party

As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man
Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan
Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan
Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man
Talking to me monotone, hardly ever coming home
Knew he was the villain never been a fan of Superman
Beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming:
"Bitch you better listen when I speak my mind!"
Used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time
But made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined
Was walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that
Football was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High
But my daddy was the man that would be suicide
Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride
Always told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back

Uncle counting money while my daddy cut him grams
Made me promise that this shit would never touch my hands
And it never did said it'd make me be a better man
Smoking in the crib, hiding dip inside of soda cans
Black bandana on his arm, needle in his hand
Momma trying to wake him up, young so I ain't understand
Why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, used to see him stand
Out in the alley through my window
Drinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke
Lights flashing now he running from the Winslows
Hear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor
Sometimes she wouldn't open it, sitting on the couch
Face emotionless, I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it
As a kid all I wanted a hundred grand

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot

Niggas die everyday don't know how to live, don't know how to make sense
25 to life today just got locked away, all that just to pay rent
Now they're all bound on the slave ship
And they left behind their patience
Thought that'd last them for a little
Pass it down for my kin, ohh

Yeah, back and blacker than ever
Got sick of waiting for these actors to get it together
Still in them gutters, all my brothers is birds of a feather
Tried to get this money cause my people done struggled forever
Son of my father, gunning for stardom, it's worth a shot
They hate me like I'm fucking their mama, that's why I serve 'em hot
Shells they burning, as long as hell is burning I’ll murder God
If he was trying to fuck up my paper, nigga, that's all I got
The black and brown been going through a holocaust
You see Obama just a house nigga to me
They locked the children up in prison and they ditching the key
It's empty plates in this estate so shorty shit where he eat
He got a clip, he got a K, he ‘bout to light up the street
They catch him slipping, now they trip him knock him right off his feet
His mama crying on the news like ''that boy was so smart
Wish he never start chilling with them niggas at the park''
Been swimming with the sharks since the kiddy pool
Breaking all the written rules
Breaking the tradition of that inner-city raising fools
A raisin in the sun
They let the monkey out the cage, he got a gun
He got a book, he got a brain, you better run
Was the one that they shun
Baptized in the tears of the slaves as a young
A penny saved is a penny earned
So I'll be stacking up this copper as the city burn

He can't get no job so he hitting the block
And if that nigga getting money while them niggas sitting hungry
Ten times out of ten bet them niggas gon' plot

I never needed nobody to believe in

R.I.P., you just a candle on the cement
Once you leave so I've been trying to live forever, dawg
I got a .25 Beretta in my mama car
Same one my brother used, same one my father bought
Everybody telling when they go to court
I'm feeling like they don't make niggas like me no more
I still got slaves hanging from my family tree
The young still gangbanging like we WC
And Mac 10, Mac 10's sit up under the fleece
Because the powers that be insist on fucking with me
Since back when there was white men under them sheets
Riding horseback, walking on the backs of the free
You see we in it to survive, what the fuck did you think?
At the blink of an eye niggas could die in these streets

My life a movie, hope you liking the show
They act, we shooting, just a part of the role
The road to riches wasn't made for niggas this low

And bet the one they did it never see outside of the bars

White high schools wasn't laughing at the black jokes
Daddy had us contact high off of crack smoke
Had to get it cracking with the seven, 'cause the Mac broke
Wrist fucked up, couldn't make it to practice
Had the money in the couch and the K's by the mattress
Chasing senior bitches down 'cause we was hanging with Pac then
Sidekick thefts, if he pressed him, we packed him
Ski-masking, but niggas wasn't going to Aspen
Mayfair freshman class
But I skipped them all but Ms. Brown, 'cause that was my nigga
Ask me what had mattered more: the school or the set?
She could tell by the truancy I'm true to the shit
Couple months, I was up out of there
Mama kicked me out of the house, but, shit, I didn't care
Hitting licks, it came to a drought
So we was killing kids all for the buck
Fifteen, sitting shotgun, ready to dump, see

But you ain't know the difference
Coming home late, seeing Tyson in the kitchen trying to make his own plate
But you love my homies like you love your only son that walk and talk
Think that was the reason you afraid to see me risk it all
But your father told me no reward if it's no risk involved
And your father raised me, made me crazy, don't take shit at all

Nigga, what's the deal? Pay attention
Most the time that I've been living we been public housing tenants
Never had no pot to piss so bitch excuse me if I brag a lot
Niggas never had a shot unless you talking .38 that Wak had got
Can't get passed them pearly gates, neglecting what your pastor taught
But you gon' smoke your weed still and you gon' sip your lean still
So I'm gon' hold this heat 'til they make me take my seat in prison
Doing shit my way till 25 to life what I'm facing, baby
My temper short, that anger made me have days in court
In my hood spill blood a sport and the killer's face can show no remorse
Got student loans and you failed the course
Of course you dropped out like 6 am and you see the cops out
Niggas been turnt up, no need to stop now
Speed up, skeet up then air the block out
El Camino creeping with your homies in your backseat
Once you hit that corner watch them niggas turn to athletes
Make him run his pockets, take his wallet then his house keys
Staking out his mama house, we taking every damn thing

Ones who preach protect and serve, the main ones trying to kill you

Never wished for better days, only wished a nigga would
Never been a pump-faker, that won't do your boy no good
Still shoot it like a free throw, hammers that the cheat codes get
Daddy threw it off the glass like a bank shot, shit
I'm just trying to get the money that the bank got
Flip like a monster truck, banging never disturbed me

At apartments we used to loot, them Poppy niggas'll shoot
Homies taught me 2N's ain't need no friends
I need a black Panamera with the black 2-10's

Champagne for the pain, gram stacked up in the spliff
Blow the back out on the bitch who only want you for the dough you got
We know they know you know, but still, we got them hoes up in the spot
Getting hot and bothered, sinning in the sauna smoke
I put that on my momma, not a nigga living stopped the show
Promise that we did it way before we ever heard of rap
Niggas say they shooters, where your jersey at?

Bitches born with shovels
Guess that devil in disguise make you more than a woman
Felt the anger in your eyes since the moment I hugged you
Seemed familiar like a look in the mirror
You took a chance, and I appreciate it
Understand that over time, my word depreciated
But we can do it all again, waiting for you to say when
Give it time and a place, swear to God I'll attend
I should've took you to prom—fuck whoever had did
But I was busy punching niggas in the face by the gym
And you was right there
You was always right there
Forwarding your calls thinking, "How we got here?"

Big Boy!
Man, whatever day, vibe, month it is
It just feels like summer
You know what I'm saying?
It always feels like summer in the neighborhood, man
When you get a chance to come in
You get a chance to lay back
You get a chance to laugh
You get a chance to chill
Best believe that, man
And being that it always feels like summer
Let's go ahead and make you feel like summer

Summertime in the LB wild
We gon' party 'til the sun or the guns come out
JB first one fouled out playing ball
Now the whole city love you, how?
Boy we know they wasn't down from the get go
Dirty got a dozen rounds, better get low
Lil Johnny gave his life for this shit
All he got was a plot and a bottle from the Winco
Still North Side, Parkside, Vince though
Two N's, new friends, we skip those
Try finessin' my way into Heaven
Might hit that gate, might fall from grace
Splat, on the concrete, real street runner
First month still feel like summer
Cold weather won't stop no gunner
Wrong hat, wrong day, I'll kill my brother

Same ways since summer school, Baby J
Either I'ma make the news or make a play
Passed Alyssa house, could've took a different route
Wouldn't be without, think about her every day
Moved on, life fast like that
Still struggle with the past, I'm strapped
Somebody gotta watch my back
Everybody wanna count my bag
Ease off me, these streets taught me
Speak softly, please don't taunt me
Knew when Vicky 'nem stayed on eighth
If they killed me, then I'd be great
Now they lookin' at me
Summertime in the LB
Know it ain't shit a broke nigga gon' tell me now
Drop top with the top down now
All the bad bitches gon' feel me now, ayy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

She was more beautiful than anything I've ever seen
Was the dream I had longed for, for many years
How it broke my heart to see her shed a tear
But she deserved it, I wasn’t perfect, nah, I never been
So tell me why the Hell was you expecting that?
Bitching and complaining, seems to me like you perfected that
If I would’ve knew I would have never got so damn attached
Found out that she loves me not, now I'm in this Cadillac
Please don’t panic pretty lady, I won’t do no stupid shit
Just wanna be the one you love, one you hug, one you kiss
It’s funny cause ever since you left I even miss the shit you used to do to piss me off
They say an un-tampered love is lost, so I'm not downing you
Really though, I'm happy that you found a dude, but anyway
Is the rope a little tight, it seems as if your wrists are bleeding
And I hope the tape around your lips doesn't constrict your breathing
Not much room, but the trunks filled actually
That's why I got you in the back seat, love taxi

That's why I got you in the back seat
No
Don't you know I love you so
So tell me why you wanna go
Don't leave me, alone
You might also likeThe screaming stopped, blood pouring from the razor slitting
But why the frown, you should be…

Sitting here, loathing in this ambiance
Staring at this shrine of miscellaneous body parts
I think of how we got of to such a sloppy start
And which seems worse, a slit throat or a tarnished heart
I guess I got the raw end of the deal
Because this pain'll last forever, yours ended in shrills
Now my life's a nightmare, but it seems so real
Our love was full force, yet you chose to yield
So we crash, face first, blood on the dash
I guess the best lesson in life, is nothing will last
Fast forward to this fucked up position I'm in
Contemplating why to live when I'm living in sin
But shit, niggas like me wasn't meant to go to Heaven
We was meant to be alone, die hanging from a ceiling
Try praying for forgiveness, but God told me to shut up7Embed
Doctors getting nervous
They running out of prescriptions
Mentally demented emotions are non-existent
Mother contemplating if this could've been prevented
Feeling like the blame for a child turnin' sadistic
Well, really?
You can blame it all on the Ritalin and Zoloft
That had me seeing Satan in my playpen
Family, I hate them
They prayers never did shit
Fuck is God supposed to understand
The pain he never had to deal with
Hell: he never been there
But forced me to live in
Don't ask me why I'm sinning
Cus I feel that nigga owe me one to tell the truth
Either be the victim or the first to shoot
Grab the Ruger and a clip or two
I want this ballad to be played at my funeral service
For a child, 17, whose brutally murdered
By himself, tortured for years
The one voice nobody ever wanted to hear
So, the ones inside of his head had to take control
God wouldn't take my soul, if that shit was free of charge
Satan neither, I need a breather from all this breathing
Grab a trigger and squeeze it

I can love you
I can love you better

Bitches think they livin' in a dream 'til I wake 'em up
Faded off the liquor, limousines waiting in the front
Looking for a nigga with the green shinin' in the club
Trying to trade the hoes life for the red rose life
Hope we roll dice, but a seed ain't what you want
18 years with a check coming every month
Every step you take will get you closer to the paper
Pay attention to the ones known
The Marilyn Monroes use their wombs as ways to move forward
Fall with the rules to bask in the glory
Bastard child often lost in the story
Sad and unfortunate, but the game's to win

Say you love her, you losin'

And your head in the stars

Wonder what her motive is, she wonder what your focus is
Every man she ever felt done lied and left her to herself
Scared of the future, runnin' from the past

Bobby Johnson ain't my OG, this ain't no movie role
Pop's was off that O.E., trippin', gettin' his Tookie on
Thunderbird with Gold D's, a felon and parolee
McDonald's for the Double Cheese, pockets fit a couple C—
Notes up on the screen door saying to pack it up and leave
But we don’t read those
'Cause the money comin' faster than your bitch, nigga
All my life, I wanted to be a rich nigga
But homie, let me proceed
Pops was moving slowpoke, that's way before the codeine
Just methadone and powdered H to junkies with the sour faces
Knocking on the screen door, asking for their homie Nate
Ten to twenty each, 4 p.m. he leave, so don't be late
Mom up off of work asking me if anybody came
To kick it with my dad, or was he chilling in the alleyway?
"He was in the alleyway"—that's what he always had me say
Slangin' for them bills he had to pay—somebody at the door

'Cause testimonies from homies can lead to longer convictions
Police knocking at my door, pretending nobody hear 'em
Police knocking down my door with judicial system permission
Contraband in where we living, hope I don't get thrown away
In the prison, dogs are sniffing, backyard full of K's
Catch a case and knock it out, niggas fighting every day
Choppers circle 'cause a nigga chop hard on the blade
Got broads on the base, slanging rude, we banging too
Where you from? If they got that back, we clapping, coming through
Going dumb, forties, selling water, profit from the slums
Since we was young, money been the motive
Nigga, get you some guns and dope

Came home from school soon as I seen she was up out the crib
Criminal Minded, mind your business if you wanna live
Them niggas fiendin' for them luxuries they'll never get
I took a couple women's love for me and hit a lick
If she can't help me get up out the struggle, why I need the bitch?
I need a million dollars for starters, been sick of sleepin' on the couch
In this crowded apartment, them streets been in a fuckin' drought
I don't see the narcotics, it ain't no books up in this backpack
I brought the revolver, I'm asking niggas where the cash at
Tappin' they pockets
That pocket rocket make a backpacker as soon as you blockin'
You know the block is hot
Wayne tried to tell them, one case away from felon
Granny told me stay inside the house, a nigga should've listened
Been punchin' out their faces with the hands that I pray with
Money trees blowin' in the wind, I'm feeling the fragrance

Is you feeling amazing? Yeah I'm feeling the love
Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done
Pray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done
And I hear you cheering for me when my victory come

Closely play this game for keeps, I take the shot, you be the goalie
Goals I gotta reach, but this girl up in my sheets asleep
Mom up on her way to work, if she say bye before she leave
Then this my last day on this earth, I'm way too young for plantin' seeds
Is what she used to tell me, shit, but when I ever listen?
Played a lot of roles in life but never played the victim
Never paid a toll for stripes, I earned them on them lonely nights
Mac rounds tear the house down like a poltergeist

I asked my mama what's the key to life, she told me she ain't know
She just try to take it day to day, and pray I make it home
Made me wonder for a second, til I felt my weapon
Falling out my pocket, then walked inside my room before she saw it
Never had a happy home, stability's a problem
Evictions from apartments, prison letters from my father
All a nigga ever knew, if it wasn't for Rashard or Ray
I probably would be shot today, they taught a loc survival
My teachers said I had a vibrant mind, but a tarnished shine
Doing violent crimes, put the money in my pockets
Gave it to my mom, but when a nigga had a chance
Never asked where it was from, happy that I lent a hand
The day my grandfather died, I grew into a man
Around the same time I first pulled a trigger
I prayed it didn't hit him, but after awhile I ain't care
As long as a nigga still here, right?

Never had belief in Christ, cus in the pictures he was white
Same color as the judge that gave my hood repeated life
Sentences for little shit, church I wasn't feeling it
Why the preacher charge tell us everything gon be alright
Knew what it was for, still I felt that it was wrong
Till I heard Chef call himself God in the song
And it all made sense, cus we can't do shit
But look inside the mirror once it all goes wrong
You fix your own problems, tame your own conscience
All that holy water shit is nothing short of nonsense
Not denying Christ, I'm just denying niggas options
Cus prayer never moved my Grandmama out of Compton
I prayed for my cousin, but them niggas still shot him
Invest in a gun, cause them niggas still got them
And won't shit stop em from popping you in broad day

I still remember when I saw ya
5 foot 5, maybe a little taller
Smile that reminds me of Christmas morning
When you first woke up and them gifts was opened
Yes sir, baby girl ill
Got me feeling unreal like I popped that pill
Neo-Nazi, killer body
I think I love ya, prolly
But I don't even know ya
I tapped you on your shoulder, asked your name
You gladly told me, then you asked the same
I told you I was Vince
And you said you heard about me well I hope you didn't listen
Thought that I should mention, that you my perfect vision
Remind me of the middle school days when I couldn't wait to get to class
Just so I could fall asleep and dream about your pretty ass
So baby we can go far, but its up to you...

I see your pretty face, and I try to approach her
I know that we just met, but can we get closer?
What can I say, to make you stay, the night with me?
And girl it's up to you...

Yeah... look...first name crystal, last name amazing
Stars in my mind really got my heart racing
They say I shouldn't rush, that I should pace the situation
But these feelings in my head has got me feeling impatient
You could say this love thing has got my heart aching
Even if it's waiting, when she say that she is taken
All options open, so I keep my doors vacant
I know that she baking, off this shit I'm making
Thinking that it break in, hoping that it break out
Lights all on, you taking pictures with your face out
Full on platters where waiters bring the steaks out
But how can I leave, when there's no one else to take out
And I know it ain't my business...
But I just thought that I should mention...
That you know what I'm missing, so don't sit there
And try to act like you don't feel this...

And rather rob a nigga, when I get the chance, teacher's tell you
"Get a plan, go to college, let them empty out your pockets"
What the fuck I look like, nigga? For real
It's safe to say I put my heart in the trap but
How in the hell could you fault me for that when
It takes money to be shit and we never seen it
So I'm doing dirt, let the police clean it
Standing on the edge of a tall cliff
Trying not to fall deep into the shark pit
I guess I'm God's gift to Hell in a funny way
Can't wait to see my life change once the money came

Niggas only come around when the money's 'round
Catch you slipping 'round the town just to gun you down
Wasn't fucking with me then but I bet by now
These mothafuckas know they like my style
Tryna figure out, What the hell they want from me
Why I love everything that involves money?
Hope I get enough just tryna live it up
Shit I want yours too, you should give it up

She said she like money, I like Hummer's, you want to trade?
Just another disappointment in my fucking day
Slave to my lifestyle, would try and make a change
But I heard about the shit they doing to the runaway's
Swear that I would change everything if my gun could stay
Said she doesn't understand, anything I fucking say
Problems with women, she's tripping but get's pissed
Cause I tell that she just a bitch, and never really meant much
But if I told you that I loved you would you give a fuck?
Or even have the decency to listen up? Probably not
I swear like every time you come around my fucking heart will stop
Can't wait 'til I make way and the talking stops
But for now I just stare you down in the parking lot
From a far distance, just hoping, just wishing
That maybe you might not think I'm crazy
I know you probably wish for the same thing but fuck it

YMCMB, haha, alright

My patience wears thin with lacks of violence
Put the world on my shoulders I play it like violins
And sense, I really make none in present tense, I
Really write my lyrics in hieroglyphics, I
Really fight my lyrics can not be condensed
And the best will never feel the need to convince
My Army's offence exceeds any resistance
Be nice bitch, I just might let you meet Vince
The lights switch, so brakes are something I don't need
My reign roams, I'm Constantine with gold teeth
I play ours, realer than the words that speak in same songs
And I own every day of the week, I go hard
There's no telling where time goes
But my slow-mo flows put the world on hold
I roll like snowball effects, just watch me grow
I'm Jack Frost, I'm so cold my shadow glows

Merry Christmas you filthy animal! (Gunfire)
And Happy New Year. (Another gunshot)You might also like4Embed

Speak
Eat my flesh flesh my flesh

Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualties
It started with my bitch, mistress, and her family
Whole town mad at me, but fuck it, I am glad to be
The killer, nothing realer in this world than a tragedy
Before I take her soul, I take her ears like Tyson
Cut my main bitch with my glove
I love to ball, I never liked hoes
I couldn't trust them, so I hunt them base, molest they eyelids
Stalk their dreams and predict their every move like a psychic

Train on a dame that they met up at Chili's
She need good dick, so I make her pop a wheelie

Go and fetch me a sandwich, a BLT
No lettuce or tomato, but double on the bacon
After that, collect your shit, you need to get to shaking
Silly bitch
Ugh, I wouldn't call myself a chauvinist
You just a dumb slut who can't accept my openness
Hopeless romantic and such
You trying to get me stiffer than a mannequin touch
Manic depressive, obsessive compulsive
And it's hard to stay focused with your legs wide open
And I'm sorry that I'm easily distracted
But I got a thing for southern girls with them accents
Yep, I tend to think with the wrong head
So don't get mad if I end up in the wrong bed
Next to, a perfect pair of tits
With a glass of OJ and some Eggs Benedict
Over easy, sleazy, and you don't believe me

Cause I really got a problem
And as my father said on his deathbed
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day

When intensity is risen women end up having children
By niggas who didn't love them in the first place
Gave it up on the first date, now she fucked in the worst way
(We don't love these hoes)
When intensity is risen women end up having children
By niggas who didn't love them in the first place
Gave it up on the first date, now she fucked in the worst way
(We don't love these hoes)

She was cute, was only tryna fuck her though
But I broke the rules, so now I gotta come for hoes
Told her from the jump, that I wasn't into loving hoes
And she wouldn't be any different from my other hoes
Since a young nigga, I knew she would become a hoe
Eighth grade year, sucking dick behind the bungalows
Daddy had a bunch of dough, paid her no attention
Only paid the whole tuition, gave her extra cash for spending
She was fiending for the type of life she wasn't given
Hanging with them shady niggas in and outta prison
Thought a baby was the perfect way to keep his interest
Soon aborted when she saw he wasn't fucking with it
Cold nigga, gut checked, but she rolled wit it
Packed up, left home, took her soul wit him
Now it seems that she's only good for one thing
The one thing that we all need
Eyes dry, but her heart bleed

My army strapped, blazed where Bonzi at?
Got em wishing at the well that they see a nigga fail
Rather see me in jail then doing well like the white folk
They ain't even want Mike Jones, still tippin
Leave the tip on the table as I serve you niggas
I still ride around the city like I murder niggas
Bad hoes get Roethlisberger'd
No lies, preserve
Curb That, Enthusiasm just a lil bit
We ain't' fucking round with them rounds, cuh they still equipped
Warfare, Guerrilla clips, hold that, throwback, Darko Milicic
Sons got lojack, find ya babysitter crib, run up in that ho and blow that lil' muhfucka away
Is it wrong if I say, I'm feeling better than anybody's ever been
Herring Bone chain and some skeletons, pelicans
Rap niggas telling fibs, you ain't really selling shit
If you is, lead yo crib up like cheap paint
I tell my niggas C-safe cause the beach ain't
Most the niggas telling you to practice what you preach fake
You never talk about the dirt that you do
Cause in interrogation pigs can say that heard that from, you

And real niggas don't play by the rules, we just go hard
In yo front yard with the tools, let em dump off
Called Matlock, got the case dropped
Riding all around yo city with the safe off (x2)

You're gonna spend the rest of your fuckin' life in solitary confinement
You are finished, Kody Scott
And I said, "Nah, fuck no
Hell nah, I ain't finished, yo"
I got a spirit of a thug in me
And not just no regular ordinary thug
I wanna know like Stan Q
Motherfuckers rebellin' against the system, and that's thug shitYou might also like1Embed
If I die on the way to give you my love
Please, protect me from the world
Forgive me for what I've done
This shit harder than I make it look, what have I become?
I ain't never been no open book
Money made me numb

Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb
Money made me numb

Street life will trap you
But my daddy wasn't born a pastor
Need greener pastures
Still waitin' on the rapture
I'm never lonely
Even my daydreams is haunted
I keep gettin' smaller houses but I won't find peace 'til the Lord allows it

What's success but guilt and stress?
Ain't too many niggas had to live with that
Movin' on from what you love
Knowin' you won't ever get them feelings back
Heart broke but your ego's still intact
Dark soul, business black
If I reaped what I sowed, I'd be so astounded
No yellow brick road, just public housing
Can you please come post my bail?
It's a hunnid thousand
Know you say you wish me well
But I really doubt it
Who really 'bout it? Can't wait to see
And if I don't come home tonight
Just pray for me
Pray for me (Pray for me)
Pray for me
Pray for me (Pray for me)
Pray for me

In '76, you know, they'd stop fighting
They just start shooting
You know, and it was somethin' new to me
You know we use to fight all the time
And the next minute I'm runnin' from gunshots
So, only thing I said to myself
Say man, are we gonna start doing what they doing?
You know, same thing they do to us we do to them
And would you believe but he had to, you know
Either do or die, or stay in the house
You know, fight or stay in the house
So I wasn't gon' stay in the house for nobody

I ain't never really care about shit
Soon as my father abandoned his kids
I was down for the problems
I promised my momma
I wasn't gonna die, so I got this revolver
Hammers will heal what a fist can't fix
Won't get down I'ma sent 'bout six
Ain't no questions, I'm wit' that shit
On the highway to hell but it still ain't jail
Gotta plug and a scale, tryna make this money
Crooked ass police tryna take this from me
Either watch yo step, or you catch that weap
Niggas take your life cause you ain't worth shit
Tell my momma don't trust not a soul that she meet
9 times outta ten niggas just like me
Tryna come up off the next man
Hammer in my left hand
Voice from grandma yelling from the dead

She said just pray to sweet Lord Jesus
But he can't do shit, when you bleeding
Still ain't got no food in that freezer
You gon' do whatever you need cause
God don't come when it's niggas at the door
Shimmy shimmy ya, I'ma give to him raw
Roaches in the hallway, sleeping on the floor
Welcome to the land of the lost and destroyed

My brother Smalls, told a nigga focus on the money
But why try when they tryna take a nigga under
Spend a thousand every time a nigga make a hundred
And they wonder why I'm wild when I'm out in public
Demons form in the presences of nothing but struggle
It's easy to hustle when knowing nobody love you
Ain't nothing to lose, this money to gain
Fuck playing by the rules, shoot him in his brain
Life change when you take shit by the reins
Sitting in the rain wit' a Glock nine
Waiting for the bus on Ximeno
I wish a bitch would roll by on some funny shit
Niggas know I got mines
Hard times make niggas face hard time in a cell
Never heard of Hell, only heard of home
Hardly ever there, shit, I rather roam
Voice of my grandma yelling from the dead
She said just pray to sweet Lord Jesus
But he can't do shit, when you bleeding
Still ain't got no food in that freezer
You gon' do whatever you need cause
God don't come when it's niggas at the door
Shimmy shimmy ya, I'ma give to him raw
Roaches in the hallway, sleeping on the floor
Welcome to the land of the lost and destroyed

If 1st and 2nd Corinthians, could give a nigga spinnin' rims
Or Christina Milian, I'd prolly give that shit a chance
Coulda went the college route, but I chose the nigga plan
Broken heart sitting on my path, try and watch my step
God blessed the child with a gift then he turned his back
Told him choose his own way, guess I chose the wrong way
But it's only one way, either wit' the gunplay
Or you getting dumped on, nigga ain't a soul safe
I live my life as if a nigga could get killed tonight
Niggas running at they mouth like they wanna die
I ain't the passive nigga most would probably wanna try
In the land of the lost only the strong survive
Riding round wit' 4s under the seat
In a four door Jeep that's 400 degrees
Looking for my enemies, they haunt me when I sleep
So any motherfucker that taunt me getting shot5Embed
They told me they need a leader
I told them niggas my feature price
Music mean nothing to me if I ain't eating right
Momma told me better see the light before they cut him off
Fuck what's wrong and right, if it's a gun involved
Then I'm drumming off, nigga
Ricky Ricardo going where only God knows
Beating the block, I'm feeding the block
They want us all broke, women getting they heart broke
Prison is where our dads call home
So we don't see 'em in our homes
But nigga we from Long Beach
So Dre and Eazy never been our heros
And California niggas that see plays is weirdos
Lying like a mothafucka
Soon it's gon' be niggas dying like a mothafucka
Fry 'em like a mothafucka
I'm sick in my thoughts and sick in my soul
Never let a bitch in my heart nor a bitch in my home
Why care about a broad when all my family gone
So til' they free the packs fuck true love, I don't believe in that
You run your mouth then I'm meeting that
I won't tweet you back, I'll just see you black out
And leave you passed out, bleeding and shit
Feeding them clips, I'm the Hollow Man
Take a nigga life, he ain't got no plans
We anybody killing, we ain't got no friends (no friends)
Now back to the story at hand
They handed me nothing, I took it in stride
Take a shot at your head for taking shots at my pride
The only son my momma got that she can talk to
So you don't want no problems
That's never been a smart moveYou might also like4Embed
Yeah nigga I'm out here shining
You see me bitch, I don't see you though
Fake ass, fraud ass rap niggas
You on Twitter though, where you hiding at?
I'ma find you, little word of advice bitch nigga, don't sleep!

Heavy Duty shots out the Uzi into your momma house
Clip your momma on the couch
Now your momma running out the back door
Car-bomb strapped to her black Ford
Won't make it out the hospital tonight
You see I try to be a civil dude but bitches can get it too
Lying to the Johnny's like these rappers do in interviews
It's wavy in the beach, but nigga's crazy in the beach
It'd be smart to keep 380's where you sleep
I need a bitch like Brandy
We can make a baby in the Jeep
She's drove me crazy since "Moesha"
I'd really like to meet you
Niggas asking me for features
But nobody's talking monetary
Probably the reason why you never hear me

Tell all the girls clap your hands, you coming out of them pants
I don't ask or make demands, I'm the mothafuckin' man
Can somebody tell them broads, they coming out of them draws
I swear to God I love you all, where my round of applause at
We cashing all checks, don't call the laws yet
My niggas dogs, no need to get them involved
Cause them guns come out like the summertime sun
Yeah them guns come out like the summertime

I'm taking niggas bitches like Bowser
I pound her, you hound her
I never been sympathetic for simping
These niggas act like the women they crying over
Invite her over, dig her out then kick her out
Raw dog her then dog her, don't call until them kids is out
See I take a different route with everything I do
Where some little shit to me could be like everything to you
You could give a wedding ring to a girl you'll never screw
And I apologize for that, it must suck to be a fool
I'm tactical, been cracking hoes since secondary school
We trapping hoes, selling 4 and 5's for the price of 2
I was taught that the life you live is the life you choose
I chose the path of a winner, now shake that ass for a nigga

I need a sixty minutes
We leave you on the cement, we creeping, the windows tinted
My nigga, I’ve been authentic
You mad ‘cuz you minuscule
I will snatch your forbidden fruit
Show your daughter what dick’ll do
Crime rate through the roof, one time missin’ proof
To sit us in the cell, so we givin’ niggas hell
Ship it, zip it, sit it on a scale
Do it in reverse though
Fuck being broke, it’s way too commercial
Bruh did things should’ve been in a hearse for
Bodies on the waterfront, washed another hurt soul
Never gave a fuck though
Laughin’ in the gun smoke
Hammers like the depot and tablets like the drug store

It’s HOV­
Got the block on swoll’ like Sub Zero
And you know, I’m La Flare, I ain’t got no heroes
Tell them niggas to beware. We ain’t got no fears, ho
This is rare, you could find them niggas at Sears, though
I’m one of a kind, I don’t even try
Gunnin to shine, I’m running your mind
Killing these niggas, one at a time
Play my song, the function is mine

Ey it’s Horus, Horus, and my bitch is gorgeous
She icy like Isis, she shine like the mornin’
Goddess iron ma white tee, she know I’m important
Ma dro imported, and my plug deported
He’ll be back by fall though
I’m in the trap, no walls ho
Cookin CRACK in that loft ho
Work packed in that Tahoe
I serve packs with barcodes
You slackin like Waldo
You was acting and got robbed ho
You should get a job ho
This path, is not meant for you
Messages not sent for you
You in too deep, I’m in the coupe
Suede seats, she feel the truth
Don’t hate me, I'mma take her to a new world, new order
This feels like déjà vu, something new-­-­
I thought I told you4Embed
