Addicted to you girl like the Codeine

You want a nigga like me it dont come cheap
Baby Ima go hard Im a straight freak
You can run now later you gone chase me
Cause you been playing games with me for like 8 weeks
We got that dope love
We got that bond thats unspoke of
Too thug we ain't giving haters no love
Sold drugs to ya ex man and made love
My dope girl, double cup leaned up
Save ya
Thank the creator cause he made ya
Thank ya, gotta thank yo momma cause she raised you
Hater, I think that yo daddy is a hater
Say there ain't no need to jump shot on a player
