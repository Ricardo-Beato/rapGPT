11 ContributorsI Might Be Lyrics
Yeah, huh, huh, huh (Yeah)
So Icy Entertainment, CEO speaking
Gucci

Is you rollin'?

Yeah

East Atlanta slum, man, that's where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy 'til your bitch came in (Came in)
'Bout the same time that that thang kicked in (It kicked in)
Now she ain't really pretty, but she got a nice body
I'm geekеd up thinkin' this Buffie the Body
Ain't your name lil' Trina? 'Causе you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action
Gucci Mane, you stupid, man, I love the way you flowin'
Ridin' in my drop, but I don't know where I'm goin'
On 285, I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple
"Gucci, show time," give me five more minutes
And a cold orange juice, 'cause I'm really, really trippin'
Went to the strip club and requested "I'm The Man"
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubber bands
You might also like
Is you rollin'?
Is you rollin'?
Is you rollin'?
Is you rollin'?
Bitch, I might be

Bitch, I might be hyphy
I'm from California and these might be Nikes
Come and run up on 'em, nigga
I'll wear your size, you wear my size
I got a Big Mac, let's make french fries
I'm high as a plane, pop a pill, disappear like David Blaine
Come back on the track with Gucci Mane
I got ten pills, ten hoes, I'ma run a choo-choo train
All through Atlanta, my new nickname is Coochie Game
I don't let 'em swallow, I show 'em how to use it, man
Wah-da-tay, my damie, make 'em sell they pootie tang
You got some bad bitches, I suggest you do the same
Treat my hoes like my cars, drop 'em, then blow they brains
Wash 'em up, then blow they brains
If she swallow the whole bat and the ball, she can roll with Game
I been the soldier boy, niggas know the name
I Superman that ho and call her Lois Lane
Is you rollin'?
Is you rollin'?
Is you rollin'?
Is you rollin'?
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be

Gucci Mane La Flare, nigga, get your mind right
Order Cris' by the twelve like a case of Bud Light
Sell kush by the bale, so you know my shit tight
7:30 in the morning on an all-night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shawty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
Like a rich rock star, nigga, I'm gon' party
Got a party pack of pills that's at least 'bout forty
I'll pour 'em in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pills, call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pills, man, I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill, that's a damn good deal
Is you rollin'?
Is you rollin'?
Is you rollin'?
Is you rollin'?
Bitch, I might be
