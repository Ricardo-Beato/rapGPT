12 ContributorsChurch In These Streets Lyrics
Yeah
Oh man, you know what this shit is my nigga
I'd be lying to you if I wasn't telling you the truth. You know?
Bow heads, let's pray
I just call it how I see it my nigga
I don't know no other way, you know?
Need everybody to  gather 'round, know what I'm sayin'?
I got somethin' to say
Yeah, church off in these streets my nigga
Came to bring the good word
Pastor Young, amen, amen
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Where my street disciples? Church off in these streets
Call my congregation, church off in these streets
Call me Pastor Young, I came to spread the word
Spread the word like my partner spray them birds
If you gettin' it how you live it, just say hallelu
If you out here and you poppin', best to have your shooter
I said it and I meant it so you know it deep
I came to spread the word, it's church off in these streets

Heard he took a unit, broke it down to singles
Take them one by one just like them bitches Pringles
Heard he lost it all and then he got it back
All them folks a tell that's why I got attacked
I'm in this bitch, I'm feelin' like a million dollars
Okay I'm loungin' know I'm short a million dollars
The first around the corner got a nigga stressed
Just hope he send a blessin' off in my direction, hey

Where my street disciples?  Church off in these streets
Call my congregation, church off in these streets
Call me Pastor Young, I came to spread the word
Spread the word like my partner spray them birds
If you gettin it how you live it, just say hallelu
If you out here and you poppin', best to have your shooter
I said and I meant it so you know it deep
I came to spread the word, church off in these streets

My nigga got a plug and then he got indicted
Saw him in that foreign thing then got excited
Graduated from the streets and I ain't have a tutor
If you see another day then just say hallelujah
Ain't no fuckin' secret, know I came from nothin'
Told myself that I'mma go and grind for somethin'
Hustle cause I gotta splurge when I can
Just know you lookin' at a God-fearin' man

Where my street disciples?  Church off in these streets
Call my congregation, church off in these streets
Call me Pastor Young, I came to spread the word
Spread the word like my partner spray them birds
If you gettin' it how you live it , just say hallelu
If you out here and you poppin', best to have your shooter
I said it and I meant it so you know it deep
I came to spread the word, it's church off in these streets1Embed
