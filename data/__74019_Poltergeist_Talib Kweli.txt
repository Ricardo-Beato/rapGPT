This the night, this the night
Pull out that thang, it's scary like poltergeist
This the night, this the night
Pull out that thang, it's scary like poltergeist
This the night, this the night
Pull out that thang, it's scary like poltergeist
This the night, this the night
Pull out that thang, it's scary like poltergeist

I'm Gucci Mane the bachelor
I attract em, can't figure out my vernacular
Can't understand but they sucking me like Dracula
I'm African American
My car another land
See where I'm from
We stay strapped up like Pakistan
My home boys selling bags
Have your eyes like Jackie Chan
What the bumbaclot
Gucci Mane through thick and thin
My homeboy in the pen lend a helping hand
I bet where he done been
Thinking when I'm gonna win
Well you can't answer to no one yous a fuckin man
I know you might not feel me how you probably feel me then
But I hope you listen harder to me than you listen then, its Gucci
You might also like
This the night, this the night
Pull out that thang, it's scary like poltergeist
Here in ice, it's my life
And the Lambo doors hit the sky
Pull up the price, jump out g5
We aight, she on a kite
Im on a cloud, Im feelin aight
And the Lambo doors hit the sky

I'm a ???
They ghost to a family like an apparition
Slave to the rhythm of a bad decision
Now ya name is a number, like a mathematician
They respect me cause I spit fact not fiction
Got a hard drive, even when my laptop missin
Criticize a nigga, well that’s not dissin
Your surviving off fear, homie that’s not livin
I love that shit, you talk that shit
You sound real old, get a walking stick
I know this might be awkward a bit
At first til you learn how to hop off my dick
Ain't nothin to fear but fear itself
These scary ass niggas who prepare they self
Really nigga, do you hear yourself
To me you can never compare yourself
You say you got a gun
But I dare you to pop it
Clearly retarded getting daily departed
Theres fear in your heart
I'm a serious artist
And the liquor stays bloody like a period started
In the street beef, really startin in the streets
That barcode really like a mark of the beast
I might wanna jump on a flight, just to jump in the fight
They scared cause my music goes boom boom boom boom
This the night, this the night
Pull out that thang, it's scary like poltergeist
Here in ice, it's my life
And the Lambo doors hit the sky
Pull up the price, jump out g5
We aight, she on a kite
Im on a cloud, Im feelin aight
And the Lambo doors hit the sky

Halloween they think its poltergeist
I'm in the apple green
They look like motion lights
And I'm over iced
How I rock my polar ice
Yeah super-size
I love that ??? life
Take my advice
You need to verbalize
Baby what you want?
Before I pass you by
I'm too turnt up
Don’t give a fuck about
I prolly never wanna
Smoke with my pistol out
This the night, this the night
Pull out that thang, it's scary like poltergeist
Here in ice, it's my life
And the Lambo doors hit the sky
Pull up the price, jump out g5
We aight, she on a kite
Im on a cloud, Im feelin aight
And the Lambo doors hit the skyEmbed
