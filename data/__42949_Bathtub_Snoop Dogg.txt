36 ContributorsBathtub Lyrics
Uh, that felt good
Does it, baby?
Yeah, rub my back for me
Where do you want me to rub it, baby?
Right here
Okay
Oh
Turn around
A'ight, check it out, though
Why don't you put me on some music?
What you wanna hear, baby?
Put me on some of that old gangsta shit
A'ight then
Damn, the fuck is that?
Every time I'm chilling someone ringing my motherfucking doorbell
You want me to get that for you?
Yeah, handle that shit for me
A'ight, I'll be right back

What the fuck?
Hey, Snoop!
Yo, what's up, Snoop Dogg?

Hey, hey, hey Snoop, what's going down?
What's up G-Dogg?
Oh, nothing, trying to live between the sky and Earth and ain't touching dirt nowhere, man
Right, right
Everything fucked about right about now, Dogg
I'm about ready to get up out this, damn
I'm ready to get his shit up, man
With the motherfucking law after me
Punk-ass bitches, sucka-ass niggas
I can't take this shit no more, dog
What? Man, you want to get out the game? Come on, man
You can smoke a pound of bud everyday
You got a big screen TV, man, you wanna give all this up?
You got the dopest shit out on the streets
Nigga, is you crazy? That's the American Dream, nigga
Well, ain't it?
Fool, you better come on in
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up, Snoop
Hey, nigga, I put five dollars on the weed
You better quit fucking with me
You might also like
It's time to get busy in this motherfucker
Like we always do about this time7Embed
