Yeah

Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, molly
Percocet, my rep move up like a dolly
If I talk about this shit more often, prolly
If I talk about this shit more often, more often
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, molly
Percocet, my rep move up like a dolly
If I talk about this shit more often, prolly
If I talk about this shit more often, more often

I ain't never fuckin' with no sneak diss
Best get off my dick, boy, you better not repeat this
Cocaine what I flip, jump in the whip, cannot compete with
A real OG like me, you know I get that dough like deep dish
Got the party jumpin' in Atlanta like I'm Freaknik
Got the party jumpin' in Atlanta like I'm Donald Glover
I don't want no good girl, I'm thinking I need a freak bitch
I don't want no good girl 'cause your boy ain't no lover
(Revol on t'nia yob ruoy)
Fuck her with no rubber then I bounce back
Smokin' on some shit so good, I can't even pronounce that
Shawty, drop it low and make it bounce back
Smokin' on some shit so good I can't even pronounce-nounce

Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, molly
Percocet, my rep move up like a dolly
If I talk about this shit more often, prolly
If I talk about this shit more often, more often
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, molly
Percocet, my rep move up like a dolly
If I talk about this shit more often, prolly
If I talk about this shit more often, more often

Uh, I don't really wanna glorify it, but the streets glorify it
So I gotta glorify it 'fore the people throw a riot
If I don't talk about it on my album, they won't buy it
Man, fuck that, listen up, quiet
They wanna see a black man fall down, uh
They wanna see a black man lose
They wanna see a black man fall down
They want more blacks to sing the blues
They wanna see a black man fall down
They wanna see a black man lose
They wanna see a black man fall down
They want more blacks to sing the blues
Bank don't wanna give me a loan for my house
That's why I sell bricks by the gas station
Never had a foundation
White man split up all my people on the plantation
Hope somebody prayin' for all they salvation
Hope somebody prayin' for all they salvation
Even though this the dialogue inside of my brain
I'm filled with pain, but I just can't seem to refrain from
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, molly
Percocet, my rep move up like a dolly
If I talk about this shit more often, prolly
If I talk about this shit more often, more often
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, molly
Percocet, my rep move up like a dolly
If I talk about this shit more often, prolly
If I talk about this shit more often24Embed
