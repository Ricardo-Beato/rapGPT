4 ContributorsOn the Move Lyrics
Well, here we are
United just for you
Our flat-top cuts are new
Because we're on the move

Na-na-na now girls step up, the quick ones kept up
The slow ones need to pep up to keep Big Daddy's rep up
Cause I don't let up or get up or even set up
On a a speak freak, I know how to make you shut up
Gasp your breath as you huff and puff
The Big Daddy got more than enough good stuff
Cause I'm just like secret when it comes to trimin'
Strong enough for a man but made for women
So come one, come all, I'm not about bein' picky
It only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie
From the Cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely
Smooth and suave, that's why girls dream of me
And not to flaunt, I love a flirt with a skirt
And after a concert, a little neeeaaah don't hurt
Just to hear the girls screamin' out wild, G
You're not a Jungle Brother, but that's some Jimbrowski
I'm like a pimp, see, and iff you tempt me
I can fill up any girls that's empty
Give you somethin' that's mighy and strong
But ladies, don't get me wrong
Because you say that I love 'em and leave 'em, but no, I please ya
And then catch amnesia
But the party people can't be denied
So I remember those who's on my side
You might also like
Well, here we are
United just for you
Our flat-top cuts are new
Because we're on the move
 "Scoob Lover, my brother."

The mic goes around like a 40 ounce
Now, I'm-a take a sip, now it's time to bounce
I won't get tipsy, I don't drink and talk
And, no, I'm not a hoddlum by the way I walk
Cause I'm one hype, one brown-skinned brother
For those who don't know me, I'm (who?) Scoob Lover
A jolly good fellow, flowin' with the mellow
For all the choice cuties, I'd love to say "Hello"
So take away the 3, let's stick to 1, 2
Me and you, now here's a clue what we could do
It begins with an S and ends with an X
Hmmm, not the number 6, so guess what's next
So girls, don't barge, don't blink, be still
Cause it's about time for Scoob to get ill
Remember you dissed, now you wanna kiss
Write me fan letters, sayin' that you miss
There's only one rap dancer, the cool romancer
If I had a million dollars, I'd try to cure cancer
But I'm only here to get illy, ha
Now, I'm drug free and I don't smoke Phillies
So come here, shorty, go buy me a 40
And make sure it's cold so the crew can get naughty
Well, here we are
United just for you
Our flat-top cuts are new
Because we're on the move

"Scrap Lover, my other."

You get jacked if you ever try to nap
Ona a rap from Scrap because you know there's no haps
Now, right from where I left off, to all those who stepped off
You know you had it comin', the blame is what you slept off
?Destruction played a part on roll, here's so to say.?
You can't mislead me. Why? Cause I know the way
Always gave headaches, never known for heartaches
Time and effort, huh, that's what a star takes
Let me give you a true piece of mind
Cause this rare species is so hard to find
I'm custom-made for all the ladies with guts
A tall box of hair or rather cameo cuts
Draggin' tattoes is what the girls found
Two on m chest, one draggin' on the ground
To all the young ladies that's clean and legit
As long as I got a face, you got a place o sit
No tokens for heart-broken turnstiles
No remarks or regrets, but I'll burn while
Those that's destined to question for a new thing
Join us in harmony together as we sing
For all the ladies determined that once was
So jealous, stop searchin' now cause....
Well, here we are
United just for you
Our flat-top cuts are new
Because we're on the move


You don't stop, you don't stop
You keep on to the break of dawnEmbed
