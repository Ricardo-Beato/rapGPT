2 ContributorsL.A. Lyrics
Yo, I dedicate this to you and you and you
And you and you and you
And you right there

Yeah, broadcasting live and direct from sunny
Sunny sunny shiny Southern California
Where it never rains, I’ve warned ya
About the G’s, and the palm trees, and the convertible lo-lo
G-rides, bitches, and beaches, and britches and bean pies
Freaks with green eyes
Guys wearing disguise, used to be men
Now they women trying to blend in
Yeah, all from the town from the sound
Known for the niggas that’s known to get down
And isn’t it ironic
It’s more to L.A. than drive-by shootings, carjackings and The Chronic
Yeah, look a little closer
Move real slow and do what you’re supposed to
Got a poster with Kobe-Kob’ and Shaq
Home of the Lakers and the money-makers, that’s a fact

And we’re living in the lifestyle
Living with the rich and famous and the poor and aimless
Living where life’s wild
Doing the same old same and we do it again
You might also like
LA LA, the city of smog
Some gangstas wear suit and ties, some drive a hog
Went to the same high school, even shared a class
One quick to sue, the other quick to blast
Me, I don’t ask what’s wrong or right
Nubian queen turned hoochie in the night
Also turn vampire and they bite, leaving marks to switch
Rollin’ on Wilshire with the poor and rich

Never gave me the time of day
Now I’m just a rhyme away, from the summit
Now they tryin’ to find a way, to spark somethin’
After we done marked somethin’
Like dogs do, already involved
Embers in the dark shed light into the park
So we can play again
Heart’s been astray, now I know the way again
Big old price to pay again
After layin’ ‘round, you know the sound

And we’re living in the lifestyle
Living with the rich and famous and the poor and aimless
Living where life’s wild
Doing the same old same and we do it again

Shielded by the spirit of debt
1-5’er, 1-9’er, ’71 is when the mission begun in Irvine
I’ve been all around but I really love the Cali sunshine

See, it’s a very small world (where we’re from)

No place like it in the world (where we’re from)

Hustlers and fly girls trying to get some

Welcome to the place where the sun submerge
The sky’s not the only place where stars emerge
On dreams we purge, to kill our urge
Aspirations embedded like handprints at the Chinese
Convertible down, warm Santa Ana breeze
While you’re cruisin’ on the 10, from sand to sand
Some represent with the ‘W’ on their hand
Often I say “dude”, I’m talking to my man
Grab the tan in the laid back land
There’s nine million stories and every game ranEmbed
