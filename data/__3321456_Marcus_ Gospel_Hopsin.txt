29 ContributorsMarcusâ€™ Gospel Lyrics
I done lost myself again
I done lost myself in sin
I've been burned by selfish men
I've been died but held it in
I do not want Hell to win
Life's cold, I done felt the wind
Could it be any clearer?
When I look in the mirror
I just see a jackass with a tail to pin
Me and my family ain't close
So I got some fame and went ghost
I am not paintin' a hoax
You can hear the pain in my flows
They say that life has its ups and downs
But why do I stay in the lows?
I don't like Marcus, I don't like Hopsin
I am ashamed of them both
You see, all that I have is my money
I had no idea that this was coming
I fell into the stereotype of a rapper
I'm how they package a dummy
This is my reality I embrace
I look back and I can see my mistakes
I just wish that I could rewind the days
I honestly don't want to be out of place
I guess we gotta face
All these issues like this as a human sometimes
Yes, I am losin' my mind
If you have come to that conclusion, it's fine
Don't ignore all of the proof and the signs
I made my bed, I'ma lay in it
The thought is as soothin' as wine
Now all I need is a suit and a tie, I tried
You might also like
In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting
I'm in need of some company
God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again
(This lonely road again)

Take it away, I want the peace, I want the happiness
I took a blindfolded shot, it was accurate
But in my heart I know I never asked for this
See, this life I'm in, it seem miraculous
Who knew I'd break a few bones when I tackled it?
It's been years and I still can't adapt to it
I cannot predict what my next chapter is
There's a hearse speedin' fast in the ashes and
I feel like I lay flat in the back of it
There's no love in my eyes, so look up in the sky
Bring me back like you did Lazarus
I can hear the Devil whispering, "Come play!"
Injecting me softly with numb pain
My fingers are covered in blood stains
It's torturing not seeing my son Zade
But one day, that will all change
When the fog strays, it's a lost page
That had blown away into the hallways
In Atlantic where the wild dogs play
When you're confined into a small space
You will know that that's enough to cause rage
I'ma kick until the fuckin' walls break
I don't know what made me walk straight
Into this fire, my soul is burnin' quick
I've been told this isn't permanent
Growin' up, my father made a lot of mistakes
I do not know why I didn't learn from his
Can you direct me to where the furnace is?
I need to do away with pain that's lurkin' and
Maybe figure out what my new purpose is
All these bad vibes are so discouragin'
In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting
I'm in need of some company
God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again
(This lonely road again)
In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting
I'm in need of some company
God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again
(This lonely road again)2Embed
