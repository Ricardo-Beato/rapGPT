6 ContributorsTurn Up Or Die Lyrics
Just got off the phone thinking they know we're in Hell
30-minute conversation with my partner he in jail
He said “Young, don't you let these niggas trick you out your spot”
Homie on the inside nigga love you like you're Pac

Tell it fuck it I'm faded, 'bout to turn up I'm hot
All you hating ass niggas need to lay down and die
If a bitch text me now, she might not get no reply
I'm too busy doing me, I'm 'bout to turn up or die
Niggas turn up or die
Niggas turn up or die
Niggas flicking, niggas hating
Niggas turn up or die
Bitch, turn up or die
Bitches turn up or die
Niggas hating, bitches flick
You gotta turn up or die

Oh shit, young back on his old flow
Tell you niggas something that you didn't know
Grown ass man, they're on that little boy shit
Talk, talk, talking rack with no chest, little boy shit
Can't pick your bitch self unless I put it down
When they was 24 a piece, I served the whole town
What the deal on streets want some new shit
Talking so hard this shit go where the news clip
? porches, I killed them again
Told your own recession nigga I was playing to win
Passed these niggas 10 times they're in my rear view
I'm on this gangster Gibbs, nigga, I can't hear you

Ok, I got an announcement
Niggas talking money, ain't got an accountant
You can ball for the money, yeah, I got 3
You niggas wanna play the game, well I got thee
You can play with them other niggas, homie not me
How dare you open up your mouth speaking on a G
Oh no Young is feeling like a spirit now
Guess it's time to play, shark in an aquarium
May you little niggas talking on that lil shit
Pillow talking with them bitches, yeah that pillow shit
Ye you know I'm blowing killer, yeah that killer shit
Streets say nigga get back on your dealership
