12 ContributorsUs Lyrics
I'm on that Marilyn
She got that Adam's apple and she asked about that fashion
And we passed her with that laughter
And passed her wacker friend
Peace to the geese with that Karrine
If they the geese that act up then, it’s beaks in the streets n' feathers and
She put a decent effort in but she’s at the precinct hemorrhaging
Bring it to these bitches like Alpo
Bitches gettin' stitches if she under my scalpel
Bitches gettin' vicious when I tell 'em who the sight's on
Have these girls runnin' like roaches with the lights on

They been on that groupie shit
We been on that Gucci shit
Apple Cherry coochi clit
Mmm mmm, yeah
Ya'll be swearin' you the shit
But ya'll be sharin' shoes and shit
Cool it bitch
Yeah, we ain't even paid for it

(You know why, ya know)
Cause I can't entertain you
I got nothing to say to ya, no no
But I don't even blame you
If I was you I'd hate too
Y'all can't even fuck with us
Can't even fuck with us
(You can watch the rain pour, everything is paid for)
Y'all can't even fuck with us
Can't even fuck with us
(You can watch the rain pour, everything is paid for)
You might also like
These bitches fadin', they poppin' shit
And they hatin' cause we are
We the crème de la crème
All them other bitches "H" to the "I-M's"
These niggas like her, they tryna get in her cypher but he can't
Can't even roll text with us, these niggas can't even stand next to us
Trust, that I seen these bros be tryna make ends meet, Pantene Pro-V
Tryna send beats to her and he's hoping
He can get a 16, he can get me open
But, um, I ain't fuckin' with these hipster niggas
These niggas really like sister niggas
You know them sweeter than a spritzer niggas?
I know niggas probably kissed a nigga
I know niggas probably dicked a nigga, huh
Anyway, it's the B-A-N-K
"S" to them niggas with that V-I-S-A
C-A-S-H, E-U-R-O's
Put a couple commas in them Z-E-R-O's
Lookin' for the dollars, fuck the C-O-I-N's
I need to get enough for both me and my friends
Yeah, we more dimes than two bucks
But these niggas be up in the hood like Ku Klux

Puffin' on a loose again
Puffin' on that 2 for 10
All these niggas
Ooodle and noodlin'
Yeah, yeah
Ya'll niggas cool and shit
But all my bitches too legit
We out, out, out
Cause I can't entertain you
I got nothing to say to ya, no no
But I don't even blame you
If I was you I'd hate too
Y'all can't even fuck with us
Can't even fuck with us
Y'all can't even fuck with us
Can't even fuck with us1Embed
