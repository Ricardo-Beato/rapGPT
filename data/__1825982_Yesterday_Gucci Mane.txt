Grind new license , slicing up a swisher
Gucci mane LeFlare, baby imma real nigga
Gucci be the guard man coming up in the partment
Old school 74 automatic started
People can't afford it girls on ....?
100 to the lawyers nigga drop them charges
Going in like sam like i hear voices
Keep telling me to buy new porches
Live before you do, nigga you got two choices
Gucci man the block bitch you got two bosses
Coming down the street in twenty Royce rolls
...? baby look good ima pay her mortgage
It ain't tricking if i afford it, trapping out the house and the windows boarded
14 tryna get brand new jordans, music loud and the rims importantYou might also likeEmbed
