4 ContributorsMs Pac Man Lyrics
Miss Pack Man
She don't even do no trappin
'Cause  nigga  sack, man
Miss Pack Man
I  woman  back, man
Yellow diamonds like Pack Man
Miss Pack Man
You can tell the way she acting
That she know I got a pack in
Miss Pack Man
 back, man
 pack in
Miss Pack Man

Give me that pussy and 
Every morning that I wake is orange juice and chopped steak
Niggas can't relate, if they ain't never had a pack, man
Same thing as  bad woman, rolling with a bad man
When I'm out of states, you wait for me to come back with the weight
Miss Pack Man, the top bitch, the one they love to hate
She get on top and take her time, then she do it slow
Miss Pack Man, got  like Jacki O
Super thick  on my side line
Miss Pack Man, the defenition of a dime
Super thick  on my side line
A dope boy bitch, the defenition of a dime
You might also like
Miss Pack Man
She don't even do no trappin
'Cause  nigga  sack, man
Miss Pack Man
I  woman  back, man
Yellow diamonds like Pack Man
Miss Pack Man
You can tell the way she acting
That she know I got a pack in
Miss Pack Man
 back, man
 pack in
Miss Pack Man

 jumping out  blowing purple
 home,  Louie 
Hold up, baby,  I'm a shoppaholic
If you ain't flossin, then point me to your boss man
So I can do it to him proper
You niggas servin onions, like them niggas servin wappers
He roll me up a blunt of kush, and tell me baby, test that
He got my kitchen table looking like a meth lab
Five thousand pocket change, just for my pocket book
'Cause my top so fire  I ain't gotta cook
I sit there looking gorgeous, while he whipping up his meter
Nother 28 grams  put  on my feet
Miss Pack Man
She don't even do no trappin
'Cause  nigga  sack, man
Miss Pack Man
I  woman  back, man
Yellow diamonds like Pack Man
Miss Pack Man
You can tell the way she acting
That she know I got a pack in
Miss Pack Man
 back, man
 pack in
Miss Pack Man

Now my partner  Gucci Mane caught it
I started high stepping, soon as I touched the 
 quarter bag 
We still scoring 6, 'cause we use 
Zone 6  the birds still dirty
The trap hall of fame, till I retire my jerzy
I call her Miss Pack Man, but she's not working
Hands  can't do no serving
An ass like that, she can't be no verjin
She look like a  in person
Miss Pack Man,  often
Her nigga make moves, so she knows to keep walking
And just like  often
Don't know 
Just like  often
Don't know 
Miss Pack Man
She don't even do no trappin
'Cause  nigga  sack, man
Miss Pack Man
I  woman  back, man
Yellow diamonds like Pack Man
Miss Pack Man
You can tell the way she acting
That she know I got a pack in
Miss Pack Man
 back, man
 pack in
Miss Pack ManEmbed
