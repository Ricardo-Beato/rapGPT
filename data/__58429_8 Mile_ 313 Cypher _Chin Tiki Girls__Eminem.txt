34 Contributors8 Mile: 313 Cypher (Chin Tiki Girls) Lyrics
I use my voice to spit the fiery frame
Try and refrain, dying in vain
Soon as I'm replyin' your name
I be the nigga in the Shelter who be eyein' your chain

Yo, yo
313 area, bound to bury ya with vengeance
My rhymes sentences'll put an end to your existence with
The rigorousness, niggas, I'm serious, delirious, cause
A curious—pause the fury calls from my jaws
From devourin' y'all raw

Woo, okay, okay. 313rd, we in the house.  you know what I mean,  finest. Yo DJ Iz, lemme get that beat, baby. Gimme that beat. Come on, come on. Uh, uh, uh, uh

You forced to listen to the individual, the metaphysical
The Mac Mitten, rhyme ritual, heterosexual
Syllables they sound complex to you, lines perplexin' you
With words that could put a hex on you, snap that neck on you
Murder you, boil you, we keep a white boy or two
Let my man grab the mic, you see how Bunny Rabbit do

Come on, man. Come on, man
Kick that shit, baby, come on
Come on, man
Uh, uh, watch that nigga kick this shit, uh
Uh
Alright, speed it up a little bit, Iz
Come on, baby
Alright, look
Yo, yo

Your style is generic, mine's authentic-made
I roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid
My technique's bizarre and ill; I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya, that's all it took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You wanna battle? You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy, so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push, someone that I can bully
Wait a minute, I don’t think you understand fully
See me without a style's like mustard without the Heinz
I lead the new school, you're a Busta without the rhymes
I crush the shit out your line

Now I'm the Rashiki, smokin' the lick-licky
Ten freaky girls inside The Chin Tiki
Girl, when you see me, you better believe me
This ain't a game and pimpin' ain't easy
Anything goes when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me, girl, say "What up, though?
Ten freaky girls
Ten, ten, ten freaky girls21Embed
