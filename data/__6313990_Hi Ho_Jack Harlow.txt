Eh-hem
Okay
Yeah, guess who?
Uh-oh, yeah, okay

Here we go, here we go, gotta grind everyday
And they still can't believe I'm only in the seventh grade
Rappers gettin' slayed every time I hit the mic
Call me Hungry Jack, I'm just tryna get a bite
Yeah, and I spit it so athletically
Rappers not ahead of me, go ahead and credit me
Lyrically, especially I'm rhymin' so heavily
I see you gettin' mad, 'cause your girlfriend's checkin' me
(*Gasp*) let me take a short breath
Go back into my lyrical vortex
More fresh than your average rapper tryna spit a verse
Can't stop now, I got music in the works
Yeah, so I gotta stay fly
At a very low level, but you know I aim high
Reppin' KY, I'm a rap wildcat
Started spittin' flows ever since a while back
Yessir, ahead of my time
To tell you the truth, I'm just a regular guy
What's comin' next, y'all be waitin' to see
Gotta keep workin' 'cause I'm chasin' a dream
You might also like
Peace! That's it!
I think I might've gone in a little too far on that one
Alright, anyway, I'm outEmbed
