50 ContributorsItchinâ€™ Lyrics
Ayy, my mama said "fuck it, nigga, hit the streets and live"
Got some crack in the corner, and I did what I did
The neighbors, they don't like me, I got J's at the door
Told my grandma, I don't need a bed, I'm sleeping on the floor
Got my tool and my blow, them my two main hoes
Me and all my woes stick together like the Zoes
Sak Pase, who got the yay for the lows?
And I keep birds with me like I'm straight out Hollygrove

My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm ridin' around the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster when it come to gettin' that paper, ayy
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm ridin' around the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster when it come to gettin' that paper, ayy

I'm a dog, and I eat that dog food
I'm a G, I put red on all my shoes (Yeah)
Come and see, my la familia got Peru (Salute)
And I plead (What?) not guilty until proved (Yeah)
Got more birds than the zoo (Yeah)
Got chickens in the coupe (Brrr)
Got shottas that'll shoot (Bang)
And I stay on DJ Screw (Straight up)
When you drop it (When you drop it)
It coming back like DJ Clue? (Comeback)
I make a profit (A profit)
I can go and buy a school (Voila)
I'm a A1 nigga, can't lose (Yeah)
Freeband Gang, put you on the news (Ayy)
Then hit Blue Flames, shoot pool (Splurge)
Put 20 in my Trues (What that?)
That's 20,000, fool (Hey)
I put a play together (Like)
Like Peyton Manning do (That right)
I'm rapping dope to you (Future)
You might also like
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm ridin' around the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster when it come to gettin' that paper, ayy
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm ridin' around the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster when it come to gettin' that paper, ayy
