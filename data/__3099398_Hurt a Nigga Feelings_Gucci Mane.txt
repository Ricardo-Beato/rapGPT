35 ContributorsHurt a Nigga Feelings Lyrics
Ha, it's Wizop
Burr
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

Re-rock a brick, put it in the press then it gettin DDTâ€™d
When I pull with them bales my nig', you know it's COD
All these diamonds drapped all over me, your bitch can't even see
These exotic fabrics make her wanna suck me up for free
Back to all these pints stuffed in my house and I don't even drink
All these anti-depressants I sell I think that I'm a shrink
Pop me one of those whatchumacalls and fucked her on the sink
Baby lickin' the back on my balls, now I can't even think
They just tryin' to keep up with the kid and ain't been out a year
Oh, you thought you was on to somethin' man you boys ain't even real
Metro why you wanna do this tape man you know that they gon' hate
Don't compare them lil' boys to me, twenty million out the gate

Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings
Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings

Found out my friends weren't really my friends, not there through thick and thin
Out the pen ain't been home two minutes, I jumped in the Benz
See the world through my darkly tinted vintage Gucci lens
Me and mines were like Bonnie and Clyde and we ain't try pretend
Niggas hurt 'cause they seen that 'Vert drop top, half a M
Steppin' out like a Fiji water, sparklin' with gems
These are Gucci boots they cost two stacks man, these are not no Timbs
I'm so hood, no matter how much I'm still gon' get some rims
Baby lucky if she leave with me 'cause I don't even care
Bitch, Atlantic just mailed me 10 mills and I'm not even there
If you listenin' to just what I said you might be more aware
More concerned 'bout the cash you earn and not the clothes you wear
Wop!

Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings
Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings
