Nineteen, hmm, pretty young thing from the Midwest (Oh yes)
Got a long week ahead of her
When I call she gets dressed (She dressed)
Her ditsy mind and her ass, I'm impressed (I am)
I fly her into Burbank for one thing, it's sex (Alright)
She does whatever I want her to when I want her to (Yikes)
I'm divin' into her number one and her number two (Yikes)
If I go too long without gettin' it I'ma get sick (I will)
I fly her out often like, "Bitch, come get this chocolate dick!" (Yikes)
No music, I wanna hear me make her yell (Oh)
She don't complain, 'cause she knows the deal
'Cause I pay her well (I do)
She struggle with cash and I stress a lot, so it's easy, bro (It is)
Bitch, you know damn well
I need you and you need me, ho (Don't lie)
Look, little nasty chick, her ass is thick
I hit it from the back and shit
I packed the dick deep into the pussy
She ain't never gonna find a nigga like me after this (After this)
Fabulous, sexual activist
She as good as I imagined it
I'm drawn to her like a magnet
Nigga don't trip, 'cause she asked for this

Hm! She got a man and I have a girl, I know (I know)
So everything we do, we just keep it on the low (The low)
We don't leave the house
We don't go to dinner, 'cause I grocery shop (I do)
She'll cook a meal for both of us
Then let me down and blow me hot (Yikes)
I hit it about five times a day, yes I'm proud (So proud)
When she's in my house, she knows no clothes allowed (Uh uh)
No, her man calls, I move to the next room (Uh oh)
If he finds out what we just did, oh my god, boom! (Yikes)
I'm nasty with it, I hit it raw when I murked her hole
True, no kids for me, she's on that birth control (Alright)
I slap the bitch then I choke her down when we fuck, ooh (Alright)
I spit on her, then she spit on me, it's a must do (Hell)
No shyness (No shyness)
I'll be suckin' on her titty and I'll bite it (Bite it)
Stick a finger in her booty and she like it (Like it)
I'll look at her in the eyes when I pipe it (Pipe it)
She my little freaky white chick (Chick), my sidekick (Sidekick)
That pussy's priceless (Priceless)
She flies home when I'm done and stays silent
