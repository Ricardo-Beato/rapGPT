1 ContributorStuck In Traffic Lyrics
Open your mind, open up your mental
Most of the shit that you worried bout ain’t consequential
Peep the potential
What’s really essential in your feelings like a ventricle?
That’s a cavity, don’t be mad at me
Floating like zero gravity
Not many real spitters left in this great academy
I hear my flows all in they flows, I take it as flattery
Spit with conviction, like, like, I’m at a podium
Mostly people fu- fu- fu- fu- fu-, mostly people full of sodium
Seeing you do what they can’t
I float like a feather, they full of restraint
Far from a saint, that paint
I go hard in, like James Harden
My words falling all over the beat like autumn, I got ‘em going in circles
Shit has been wild, been rapping since I’m a child
I wrote poetry to help people that feel like they in a spiral
You write bullshit, and then hope that it all go viral
I been driven, boy your shot it idle
I’m homicidal word to the G.O.A.T., from the D
And every time you mention the D, you gotta mention that Jay McNasty
Don’t put it past me to go crazy on these kick ass beats
Record half an album then do the show my voice be raspy
That’s all in one day, one way, or another
We gon’ need some rest on Sunday, but knowing me, probably not
Give a fuck if he hot, I be on the block
Testing MC’s, like what he got?
Reincarnated Shakur, I’m feeling like Three-Pac
My beats knock, like Reebok
Nah listen, I said, feeling like Three-Pac
My beats knock like Reebok, that’s heavy kicks
So inspired I’m always switching up the setty-list
I’m also admired but never let it go to my head like that boy Stacey, with the Mac-Book
Chilling with Lenny and he got the backwood
We out, we outYou might also likeEmbed
