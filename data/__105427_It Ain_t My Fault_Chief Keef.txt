21 ContributorsIt Ainâ€™t My Fault Lyrics
In 'Raris all the time
'Cause I just wanna shine
And be a young nigga getting cake

It ain't my fault she call me all the time
When I be on the grind, and all these niggas want to hate
She ask why I'm in 'Raris all the time, 'cause I just want to shine
And be a young nigga getting cake
It ain't my fault she call me all the time
When I be on the grind, and all these niggas want to hate
She ask why I'm in 'Raris all the time, 'cause I just want to shine
And be a young nigga getting cake, ayy

I'm on a roll, just so you know
Bitch, I'm from the O, I can never sell my soul
I'm just on a money roll, 'til there's no more
But I can't never go, I just got to see that dough
I be grinding from sun high, to sun low
Chillin' with my bros making music, smoking dope
We be touring fucking hoes, bitch, we them Glory Boyz
It's me and Fredo, and you know we got bankrolls
Pull up, kill the parking lot in foreign drops
I'ma cop a four door Porsche and I'm dropping the top
Show no love for a thot, her eyes locked on my watch
Guaranteed to get this guap, bitch, I can't drop from the top
You might also like
It ain't my fault she call me all the time
When I be on the grind, and all these niggas want to hate
She ask why I'm in 'Raris all the time, 'cause I just want to shine
And be a young nigga getting cake
It ain't my fault she call me all the time
When I be on the grind, and all these niggas want to hate
She ask why I'm in 'Raris all the time, 'cause I just want to shine
And be a young nigga getting cake, ayy

Call up Dro, man, I need some dope
I need a bankroll, a bankroll that can't fold
You know I'ma smoke this dope 'til there's no more
Call up the dope and tell 'em we need some more
Now let's hit the studio, it's me and Tadoe
And you know we got them hoes, got them hoes, box of rainbows
We be in the trap a lot, fucking foreign thots
I got a foreign watch, shit, I got a foreign car
It ain't my fault this money on my line and she call me all the time
She say she don't wanna wait
She ask why I ignore her all the time
'Cause I be on the grind, I gotta get this cake for Kay Kay, ayy

It ain't my fault she call me all the time
When I be on the grind, and all these niggas want to hate
She ask why I'm in 'Raris all the time, 'cause I just want to shine
And be a young nigga getting cake
It ain't my fault she call me all the time
When I be on the grind, and all these niggas want to hate
She ask why I'm in 'Raris all the time, 'cause I just want to shine
And be a young nigga getting cake, ayy4Embed
