8 ContributorsI Canâ€™t Swim Lyrics(Sir Dogg)
I am Sir Dogg, DPG fuck... and I hate water
I never learned to swim....
AAAAH! PUT ME DOWN!!!! Let go of my leg!!!
I HATE WATER!!!! I CAN'T SWIM!!!! AAAAH!!!!!
(Snoop)
No matter where I go, you got'cha eyes on me
And everybody sittin' around waitin' on me
Show us how you do it Uncle Snoopy
So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggas gon' respect me
Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl though
Gettin' interviewed by mothafuckaz like Geraldo
And niggas wanna know if I smoke Newports or Marlboros?
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?
I make dat shit for the realest of millions
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin the feelin'
Hmm... and oh what a relief it is
That Snoop is back in dis mothafucka handlin' his biz
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow
Fuck these niggas and peep out Whitey Ro (?)
Somebody told? Well then, somebody gettin' rolled on
And that's usually how the scenario rolls on
Baby girl said she wanna keep her clothes on
She either fuckin' gettin' stole on or gotta stroll home
Well number one, keep your hand on your gun
And don't (don't) trust (trust) anyone (anyone, one, one.....)
You might also likeOhh... you can't trust nobody baby.... you can't even trust your own Mama!!!
This is Snoopy Collins.... trust no one.... especially a bitch....
Or even a bitch-ass nigga.... Yo Ha!!!!
T-R-U-S-T in me, I'm sexy but I'm pussy
The homies in the hood call me Lil' Bo Peep
And you da type a nigga I been dyin' ta meet
So Snoopy, what'chu tryin' to do?
Now hold on lil' mama, ain't no reason for me to lie to you
Now what I'm tryin' to do, and what I'm gon' do
Is hit this bud, I got a wife at home
Bitch I ain't lookin' for none, you might got kids for cuz, or down wit' bud
Pushin' them dubs, look here cuz
Lemme tell you how it's gon' be
If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me
I'm tellin' you the good-god truth, you want proof?
Ask them hoes over there, "Y'all wanna fuck Snoop?" (yeah!)
We'll take the money and the game away
I bet they won't say the same that day
But it's okay, cuz I don't trip
Cuz "Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks"
I thought I told you, bitch I'm a soulja
East side, long beach, gang-bang roller
From the solar, cuz this, is it
Can ya dig it? (I can dig it!!!)
Jelly Roll pulled a rabbit out his hat
I pull a strap out my mothafuckin' back (Aaah!), cuz I know it's like dat
I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread
They want a contract on a nigga till' I'm dead
If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds
They struck me out, now I'm pinch-hittin' for the Reds
But I'm a Dodger blue, so I gotta keep it true
I gotta home-run, nigga we long gone
I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin'
Rip-ridin', put mines in
Takin' this game to the next level
Trustin' no one, especially them Red Devils
Keep ya head level, hand on my get-up
Stay on the red-up, pimpin' ain't easy, but there's a whole lot of fed-up
And like I told you from the get-go, don't trust no one (no one, no one)
And like I told you from the getti, don't trust no one...
(Alien)
OH NO!!! YOU DID IT AGAIN!!!! PUT ME DOWN!!!!
I HATE WATER, I CAN'T SWIM!!!! I NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM!!!!
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED YOU!!!! I PUT ALL OF MY TRUST IN YOU!!!!
AND YOU TOOK ME TO THE WATER..... OH NO!!!!Embed
