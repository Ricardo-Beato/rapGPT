42 ContributorsWintertime Lyrics
Uh, okay, we all got skeletons in our closet from a shady past
Made me brag about my Mercedes, Jag
Going fast, made me crash
My ex keep fuckin' up my car with her crazy ass
Lately, sad
Reminisce the times, please take me back
Aimin' for the top, I'm on target like a Brady pass
Did a show for eighty cash, and threw it in my lady bag
That was fuckin' easy money, sniper, on my KD swag
Thought about quittin', I'm a warrior, can take the jab
Whoever said shit was easy forever lied
I mesmerize, how simple decisions can jeopardize
When Martin Luther cheated and stared in Coretta's eyes
This is lyrical exercise, told my idols to step aside
My mama said I'm buggin', no need for the pesticides
Was just waitin' tables, gave customers extra fries
Maya Angelou with accounts, I just let it rise
And hopefully my words never die

Wintertime and it's rainin'
But shit, I don't be complainin'
Summer's cold, shit is dangerous
Yeah, I can feel the changes (Uh)
You might also like
Try to take a walk up in my shoes
A nigga rappin' like I really got somethin' to prove
'Cause motherfucker, I do
I climb hills, niggas was sleepin', on Nyquil
Paint a picture vivid, dawg, on everything, my life's real
Was just in college, strugglin' to get a nice meal
Made it out the gutter, then that's all because of my skills
All because the glory, nigga, let me tell my story
I am not that nigga with potential, I am not a worry
I was lost like Dory, but I'm finally found
Was addicted to the Xans to calm anxiety down
And I never would admit because society clowns
Any nigga with a problem, they can't quiet me now, nigga

Wintertime and it's rainin'
But shit, I don't be complainin'
Summer's cold, shit is dangerous
Yeah, I can feel the changes

Know where you come from, it's easy to tell where you going
Yeah
Just keep dreaming 'til you find out7Embed
