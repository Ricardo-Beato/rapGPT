7 ContributorsCamaro LyricsMine all black with them blue stripes
Like my black AR, and my blue nikes
Broad day, whole clip, yeah I'm that tight
Hang up out the sun roof and holla 'Thass right!'
Keep it smoked out, boutta get it bullet proofed
Might be aiming at my head, y'all I hid a tool
Ricocheted through my seats, and fuck up my suede
And we can't be having that you know what I paid?
Bout a 125, with 4 in the split
Two weeks with that work and that's what you get
Swear a nigga on tour, that's that concert sound
And ain't nobody gotta show, it's how it's supposed to sound
Nigga I woke up this morning, bought a Chevrolet
'Whatchu pay for the wheels?''Bout a quarter K'
Got that bitch standing taller than a light pole
They say the man behind the wheel is a psychoYou might also likeEmbed
