It’s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
It’s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
It's five o'clock in the morning and I'm just getting in
I knock on the door and a voice sweet and low says
(Who is it) She opens up the door and lets me in (let me in)
Never once did she say where have you been?
She said, (are you hungry), are you hungry honey, (did you eat)
Yeahhh, let me hang up your coat
The woman says, pass me your hat
And all the while she's smiling
Never raises her voice
It's five o'clock in the morning and I don't give it a second thought
It’s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
Don't think you can keep breaking your woman's heart
It’s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
And you should sit back and enjoy it
(It’s a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)
She gonna fool you one day
The sweetest woman in the world, can be the meanest woman in the world
(If you like her that way)
You keep hurting her, she keep being quiet
She might be holding something inside, she gonna hurt you one day
Now I'm laying in the hospital, bandaged from feet to head
In a state of shock, just that much from being dead
I didn't think my woman can do something like this to me
I didn't think the girl had the nerve
Here I am, I guess actions speak louder than words
It’s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
Don't keep thinking you can keep treating your woman bad
It’s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
She won't ever get mad
(It’s a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)
She's gonna fool you one day
(It’s a Thin), It's a line thin, (Line Between Love and Hate), between love and hate
It’s a Thin Line Between Love and Hate
She's gonna fool you one day
(It’s a Thin Line), Yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)
