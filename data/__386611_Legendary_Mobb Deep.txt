14 ContributorsLegendary Lyrics
I feel the blessin' even when it's all disguised up
Even when the stress try to pile up
Paper in my hand give me wild rush
Reminiscin' on wild us and rollin' the miles up
So if I wager, I'm never putting the pound up
Let 'em hate, bitch, I built it from ground up
I hold the fort down, nigga, now what?
You could see it in the lives that my sound touched
I make money, take money, my aim hungry
Spit a verse, it ain't nothing short of a green loogie
Bucket list complete, I did a song with Bun B
And Juicy J, who the fuck fuckin' wit' me? I think nada
Lame rappers you Lady Gaga
The part you dear depart these niggas like I'm shootin' commas
State your business or forever hold your peace
Go 'head with that bullshit, motherfucker, I'm sweet

Got damn, who would've thought it would've been me?
Street legend that came up with a pen, G
16 bars to get me out the ghetto
And I always kept it real with the people, I never settle
There's a lot of folks dependin' on me to lead 'em the right way
Instead of listenin' to what the radio might play
Some real game for somebody that did it
Who could break it all the way down so everyone could get it
And I gotta admit it, the road was bumpy
Hand-to-hand combat, sometimes I live lumpy
You can't win every fight, but you gotta fight though
Just make sure when you on the side of right, bro
You don't go in thinkin' you makin' history
But lookin' back in retrospect it ain't no mystery
Nobody ain't ever did what we did then
And ain't nobody to do it again, nigga, we legendary
You might also like
Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, nothin' you can tell us
Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, all we do is kill it

Whole life we grindin' for the dough
And leave behind a legacy, the legend of the two
It's not an urban myth, no, we are the truth
If anybody gon' do it know we gon' do
Whole life we grind so hard to stay official
And make them niggas hate in back with brand new waitin' tissue
They sick to they stomachs, fuck 'em, I ain't never loved 'em
Peace to my niece, they ain't never pulled no dumb shit
Peace to the youth
The young soldiers in the street who gettin' to the money, they remindin' me of me
When you get that, better keep that, better not let that drop
'Cause someone gon' be right there and they'll take yo spot
We got our lane mastered, yeah, we got it locked
My haters wanna blast, man, you better stop
'Fore shit get good, you could see his guts
And it's too late for surgery, they can't patch 'em up

You see these gold chains of slavers, never had that to make payments
Yeah, I came from the basement, but now I vacate in Vegas
I come sell out in your state, nigga, just to make a statement
Nah, nigga, stay high, the bitch I'm with is high maintance
Homie, play me if you wanna, I got all my goons on
We gon' catch a body, but you gon' catch a tombstone
You don't got no hustle, you get cut off like coupons
Been about crutons, bro, that's why the roof gone
We still comin' up, that's what my dollar say
Ain't about no guap then stop, homie, we can't conversate
Mobb Deep and Juicy J been ballin' harder than Doctor J
Broke niggas what we can't tolerate
Got that movie money
Model chick came out the 'cuzzi money
Beat a nigga ass, now he wanna sue me money
Still in this bitch, wakin' up at 5:46 in the mornin'
Money callin', never stallin'
Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, nothin' you can tell us
Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, all we do is kill it

Who the fuck are you and what the fuck do you know?
Where the hell did you come from and where the fuck are you goin'?
Who the fuck are you and what the fuck do you know?
Where the hell you come from and where the fuck is you goin'?4Embed
