Know you sick of all the same old things
Same club with the same champagne
Backwoods, tryna burn your brain
With a broke-ass nigga in the CarMax Range
You ain't nothing but a vivrant thing
Ass too thick for your 5'10" frame
Want to spend all night in your nine lives?
Get to purring when that liquor get to burning
Get it cracking, why you acting like a virgin?
Where it come from—mama or the surgeon?
You paid for it? Did you pray for it? Get twerking
And a nigga gotta sit and wait for it, is it worth it?
Why I ask when I already know?
Don't mind me, mind already gone
Nigga better not keep calling your phone
Have my dogs in the yard at his home

You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy

Girl, you looking like something out of King—
Magazine, fifteen in the magazine
Hope a nigga don't run up tweaking
I'm tryna have a good time this evening
91 Freeway, eastbound, speeding
Late night, but the face right, I need it
Mando, I'm the man, though, you see it
Niggas wanna kill me, so I gotta keep it
I ain't really into clubs or the nightlife
Only kick it with the thugs, I ain't never did a drug
When you doing what I does, need your mind right
They won't ever catch a nigga at the stoplight
What your life like? Would you ride for a nigga?
Die for a nigga? Courtroom, lie for a nigga?
Switch up to set up or snitch on a nigga?
Maybe, still gon' drive me crazy
Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy

Siempre quieres estar en la calle con tus amigos como un pendejo, y nunca quieres estar en la casa. Tienes cosas que hacer en la casa también. Siempre quieres estar con ellos, y nunca quieres estar conmigo—what the fuck? Yo no sé que vas a hacer, but you need to get your shit together because a mí, no me vas a tratarme como ninguna otra pendeja, estúpido.9Embed
