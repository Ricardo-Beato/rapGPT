What does it mean to find your soul?
Pay the toll on a broken road
Pay the toll on a broken road
What does it mean to find your soul?
Pay the toll on a broken road
Pay the toll on a broken road

Baby, I'm free, baby, I'm free, like a homeless person
No matter how much you got, you can't own this person
Sometimes, I feel like the only honest person
When somebody snatch your soul
And karate didn't work
When you 'bout to lose all hope
The sun rose and opened roads
What if the surgeon really the serpent?
I paid for BBLs and Birkins
That wasn't me, that was Tyler Durdеn
I ain't gon' lie, I get tired of splurgin'
Lovе isn't perfect
Love is a version of bein' a virgin again
I was told it's how you interpreted it (What does it mean to find your soul?)
Pay the toll, pay the toll (Pay the toll on a broken road)
Pay the toll, pay the toll (Pay the toll on a broken road)

Pay the toll on a broken road
