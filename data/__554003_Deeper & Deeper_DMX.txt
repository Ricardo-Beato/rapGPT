2 ContributorsDeeper & Deeper LyricsArrrrre yooooou reeeaaadyyy!?
This place inside my mind, a place I'd like to hide
You don't know the chances.. What if I should die?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances.. I'm so blind
Bliiiiind
Bliiiiind
Another place I find, to escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances.. What if I should die?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances.. I'm so blind
Bliiiiind
Bliiiiind
Deeper and deeper and deeper is all I'm turning to
Living a life that seems to be, a lost reality
That can never find, a way to reach my inner
Self-esteem is low, how deep can I go?
In the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to
See through the grey that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lies
I can't see, I can't see
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm going blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blindYou might also likeEmbed
