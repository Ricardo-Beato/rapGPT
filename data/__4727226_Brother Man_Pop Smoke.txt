Big guns, bake 'em
Run down, chase 'em
Hold 'em for ransom, take 'em
Dropping them rakes, rake 'em
G check, check in
Kickback, Tekken
Bitch, I'm a giant, Beckham
All of my niggas reckless
If I call Dread, then you dead (Woo, woo)
'Cause he on what we on
Cowboy Dior
Sun out, tee on (Woo, woo)
Flea on, flea on
Yeah, I got my flea on
If you don't like me, damnit
I'm in and out Phantoms
Get mad, tantrum
It can get lit like a candle
Bust it up, Tander
Fuck all the opps, random
I know how to fight, tango
You get found in the trash, scandal

Please don't talk out your mouth
Bet I air it, hit anyone near you
Stand tall, pussy nigga, I dare you
Clean it up, I'll have somebody take care of you
Watch him get hit while I'm sitting and staring
I'm with the Straights and the Apes talking Stone to Stone
Break backs, I'm talking bones and bones
Hit 'em up then I'm going, I'm gone
Big Patek, yeah, cologne
Pop Smoke famous, up it, aim it
Free Melly Gz out the cages
Dangerous, dangerous
Rovers, Ranges, Demons, satan
Get straight cashin', Travy apein'
Two carats, icy, saucing, waving
Caked up, caking, shake 'em, shake it
Gun in hand, gun in hand
I ride for my brothers and only my brothers
You understand, understand
Understand, understand
Said I ride for my brothers, woo, woo
