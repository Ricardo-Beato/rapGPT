34 ContributorsIâ€™m Gettin Money Lyrics
Get money nigga
Yeah (Aw yeah)
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
That get up every motherfuckin' mornin' and put they work in
I see you (I see you boy)

I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggas laughed, 'til the first motherfucker got blas-ted
I put the nigga in his casket
And now they coverin' the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts
Tryin' to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hoes
Got a forty-five screamin' out surviv-al
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some ya-yo
Holla "five-o" when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen', I'm hittin' fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin' me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin' one-fifty-five
In the city where the little niggas die
Tell mama don't cry, 'cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G

I'm gettin' money (Money)
I'm gettin' money (Money)
I'm gettin' money (Money)
I'm gettin' money (Money)

Yeah, get paid nigga
I gotta get 
Get paid bwooy (Fuck the police)
Watch out for all this, nigga

Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin' round the way, think today I make a killin'
Dressin' down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
I'm gettin' high, think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin' paid today, ha hah ha
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me
'Cause they can never take the game from a young G
I'm gettin' money (Money)
I'm gettin' money (Money)
I'm gettin' money (Money)
I'm gettin' money (Money)

Yeah nigga, get paid
Can't fade me boy
To my niggas in Oaktown
Get money
That's right y'all
That's how we run the shit in '93 boy
Fuck them niggas 

Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
At point blank range 'cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin' the dice
Now roll 'em if you can't stand pain better hold 'em
'Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya' life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G
I'm gettin' money (Money)
I'm gettin' money (Money)
I'm gettin' money (Money)
I'm gettin' money (Money)
Gettin' money (Gettin' money)

Gettin' paid nigga (That's right), for my niggas in the hood
That's right nigga, that's right boy enough for love
Talk to hold that shit boy 
Pass the shit
Gettin' paid (Gettin' paid)6Embed
