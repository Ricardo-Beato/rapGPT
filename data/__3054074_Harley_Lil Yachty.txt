54 ContributorsHarley Lyrics
K. Swisha

It's Lil Boat, all my diamonds go bling, blang, blaow
Lil Boat

Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm ballin' hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no
Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a barbie
And I'm ballin' so damn hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no

Late night with the report like Colbert, aye
Left hand iced out, look like a Kid Cuisine
Lil Boat in the magazine
Big bro keep the magazines
Charged up like an Alkaline
Bet she feel dick in her spine
You might also like
Oh, ridin' like a Harley
My bitch a Barbie
Can't no one guard Boat

Harley Harley Harley Harley Harley
Ridin' like a Harley Harley Harley Harley Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm ballin' hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no
Harley Harley Harley Harley Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, aye
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm ballin' so damn hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no

Ain't nobody flexin' like me
Ain't no nigga flexin' like me
18, got the brand new AMG
Your baby daddy tryna ride front seat, no
Stop hatin' on a young nigga 'cause I'm gettin' cake
Right wrist so dipped, look like a Frosted Flake
Top of the buildin', athletes be my neighbors
These niggas soft like Life Savers
These niggas be bitches
Most of these niggas be hoes
Guess that that's just how it goes
Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm ballin' hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no
Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
My new bitch a bot
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm ballin' so damn hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no

Oh, like a Harley
Can't no one guard me
Can't no one fuck with Boat4Embed
