16 ContributorsClean (Mic Check) Lyrics
Yeah
Lupe
Chi-Town
F and F up
That's right, that's right
Yeah, ugh
C'mon, c'mon

Now, I ain't tryna toot my horn, but look what I'm on
Man, look what I bought here, look who I taught here
Look how I fought here for what I sought here
For everywhere I go, though, they be throwing salt there
But it's cool though—I'ma keep it cool, Joe
I'm as cool as Cujo—now look at my shoes, Joe (Yuh)
Now look at these shoes, yo—you can't find that
'Less you flying to Singapore, homie, you ain't buying that
All I'm tryna do is bring that time back
It Was Written, man—bring those rhymes back
Life After Death, homie—bring those lines back
Malcolm X II tryin' to bring that shine back
It's my thing, I spit it like Sean King
It's more than just rhyming—I'm doin' 'bout nine things (Woo)
The aforementioned executive board-sitting
Representing the world-famous, Grammy Award-winnin'
(F and F?) That's right, homie, Grammy Award winnin'
Could have been put it in your face, but that's the poor in 'em
See, what I gotta front for? Who I gotta front for?
Everythin' you doin', homie, is over and done for (Yeah)
But you can catch Lu chilling in his one-offs
If y'all don't know what that means, homie, then you don't understand that's mean, homie
That means, homie, these jeans on me the only pair ever sewing-machined, homie (Woo)
Yeah, I'm just showing you mean, homie, like a dictionary
Listen clearly to the clean homie (Woo)
And this ain't fair—I'm barely on my lean, homie
Or put my all into it, like a washing machine, homie
Double-loader: You just watching me clean, homie
Wait til' I start doing dirt—
Oops, I spilled some First and Fifteenth on me
And that stain, man
You can try Canada Dry, or you can try pouring Oxy Clean on me
Homie, it won't work
Clean, chickenhead-resistant—lady, you can't curse
God willing, we got the album coming out, though
You might also like
Haha
Church
Chilly Chill
Chuck, what they gon' do to us, man?
They can't do nothing, man
F and F up
Forever and forever
First and Fifteenth
