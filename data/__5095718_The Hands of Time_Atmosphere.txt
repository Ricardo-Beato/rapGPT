7 ContributorsThe Hands of Time Lyrics
The hands of time
Are slowing down this old heart of mine
The hands of time
Are slowing down this old heart of mine

I used to be assertive
But now I'm just exhausted
I used to wanna burn shit
But now it all feels force-fed
Yeah, I've got a fuckin' headache
I've had enough of all the heartache
I wanna get away, sing about the better days
It's all shade when you're fallin' through that dark space
I didn't know my story'd ever get told
I thought that I would disappear into a cold black hole
No oxygen, no control over the pressure
And no mess left after I implode
And I suppose all the confidence grows
When the shovel breaks ground and success starts to show, yeah
It's no way it won't affect the ego
So keep the injury clean and protect your emo
I'm tryna find a buried treasure
I don't got the time to carry any extra
Don't ever register the efforts of a heckler
Unless you can exploit it for your own agenda, right?
Jumped off of the top rope
And I landed at Bob Hope
Hopped in the cargo and drove to the racetrack
The player had a trailer in the back just to take a nap
I came to rap and break free from the cage
Don't ever misinterpret nothin' 'bout what keeps me engaged
I'm tryna act my age, I'm tryna lose some weight
I'm tryna face what I'm afraid of just to prove that it's fake
Then I'm out, but hold up, before we head to the exits
Let's get these bread sticks and dead this death wish
And even if we lose everything we've collected
They could never remove all of the lives we've connected (Ooh-ooh)

The hands of time
Are slowing down this old heart of mine (Ooh-ooh)
The hands of time
Are slowing down this old heart of mine (Ooh-ooh)Embed
