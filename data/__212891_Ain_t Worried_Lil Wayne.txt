52 ContributorsAinâ€™t Worried Lyrics
I'm that Dominican nigga, your bitch be talkin' 'bout
I'm in a different city, you can fuck her now
I got a whole collection of my ho collection
Y-M-C-M-B no autocorrection
I said, "Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas"
Security don't check my niggas, all y'all niggas gon' respect my niggas
Either that or get a whack or get a bat to the back of the neck my nigga
Yeah that shorty with y'all with y'all, cause she never met a big dog 'til she met my niggas
Got a big dream, from a small town
Got a small circle, you never get around
Old hoes thinkin' I'mma put 'em on now
Room full of bad bitches, I'mma put 'em all down
Always been broke, who's rich now?
I ain't never had change, why switch now?
Money talks nigga, I ain't never heard shit
Til y'all heard me spit, now everything loud
Got a mojo, with a flow-flow
Got a whole load, don't know if it's a promo
Never cuff hoes, hell no that's a no-no
Coolin' in the cut with a bud sipping romo
No love for the po-po's
Gotta pour more for my niggas in the hell hole
Never tell though, I'mma need a little more dope for my uncle
Cause I sell flows and he sell dope, nigga work
You might also like
Yeah, Euro
What up this Mack the fortune teller
The nigga that put y'all on Miley Cyrus
Negrodamus my nigga
Predicting futures
You need some lottery numbers holla at me nigga I got you

Put a nigga in that hearse, long ass K no nina
Word to Martin I'm cold with this homie buck shots
Like Pam make a nigga say, "Damn Gina"
Millzy! Money don't mean nothing, my youngin'
I'll kill you for some sneakers
This Dedication 5, no vacations slime
We in the endzone and they in bleachers
Cheerleaders, we ain't worried 'bout nothin', nothin'
Nigga act dumb, push the button, fuck 'em
Get 'em out of here like the 6th foul in the NBA
Little nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the shoulder dog
My team strapped, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, got soldiers and shooters
These bullets will swallow like shots of Kahlua
When we light up the weed then we fly like a rumor
Then hop on the plane and fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war, then all we comin' after you
Special I'm smashin ya, somethin' like Gallagher
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger
Hittin' your girl then I'm passing her
Jae Millz ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Young Money ain't worried 'bout nothin'
D5!
We ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Young Money)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Jae Millz)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (not a thing)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (D5)6Embed
