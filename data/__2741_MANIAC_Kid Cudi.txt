66 ContributorsMANIAC Lyrics
(—the black hole blacker)
Paint the black hole blacker (Yeah)
Paint the black hole blacker (I swear to tell the truth)
Paint the black hole blacker (The whole truth)
Paint the black hole blacker (And nothing but)
Paint the black hole blacker (Yes)
Paint the black hole blacker (Hey)

I am the maniac, I am the ghoul (The ghoul)
I'm in the shadows in the corner of my room (My room)
This my new hideaway, this is my tomb (Tomb)
This is my coffin, this is my place for unruliness, no worries
I love the darkness, yeah, I'd like to marry it
It is my cloak, it is my shield, it is my cape (Cape)
I love the dark, maybe we can make it darker (Darker)
Give me a marker

I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
(—the black hole blacker)

I am the maniac, I am the fool
I found the monster in me when I lost my cool (Yeah)
It lives inside of me, eating what's in its way
I put black spray paint on my windows during the day
I want to spend time with it, I think I'm losing it
Or I found it and I'm using it
I wear my shades at night so I can look in the abyss
I see something in nothingness if you can picture this
Put black holes in my jar lid, I climb the wall
I'm too high now, I'll die from the fall
Before the water's to our knees, we can't climb when the trees
Wash away, you and I are the disease
You might also like
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac

(I am the maniac)
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
(I am the maniac)
I am a maniac
(—the black hole blacker)33Embed
