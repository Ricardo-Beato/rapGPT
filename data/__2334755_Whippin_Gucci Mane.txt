7 ContributorsWhippin Lyrics
Standin' over the stove, yeah that chicken pot
Playa hatin' spreading like the chickenpox
Smoke so much, you'd think I have dreadlocks
And I'ma start back robbin' if the bread stop
I get you killed on the inside green dot
I'll make your plug rob you, whole house be cleaned out
Ain't no real niggas in the club unless my team out
Magazine in my jeans and I don't like to read
All my niggas love to eat, I got sharks to feed
I hustle 8 days out the week, you're not no boss to me
I tote the rock like Barry Sanders, I never dropped a key
And I'ma cook it for you for free but I usually charge a fee

Whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Woke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Woke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches
Screamin' "money over bitches" and I started mad whippin'
Whippin'

Whip! All my dope is whippable
All my bricks are flippable, so extra grams are tippable
My living room the chicken room, my bedroom is the treasury
I'm whippin dope excessively, I pick my trap selectively
He peekin' in the kitchen, so I feel he disrespectin' me
I'm pushin' man, but sellin' dope has always been my legacy
Seven apartments, double my garment, all the junkies beggin' me
Pills and pints and ecstasy, I need a secretarity
Damn, I said it wrong, but fuck it, I'm a celebrity
I'm re-rockin' squares, a hundred thousand profit regularly
So let me get this straight, I'm tryna hear this shit you tellin' me
You can't price this dope I'm sellin' unless you dumb niggas that's mailin' me

Whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Woke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Woke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches
Screamin' "money over bitches" and I started mad whippin'
