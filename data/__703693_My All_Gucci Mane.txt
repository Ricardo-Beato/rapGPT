10 ContributorsMy All Lyrics
Girl there ain't no question, I'll give you (?)
All you gotta do is call

I buy you the world baby, I buy you the world
I'm gon' hurt that pussy like Tampax Pearl
I'm so ready to go H.A.M for lil good girl
You never gotta' worry baby, that's my word
Feellin' her like , feeling like 
Baby, I will hug your ass tighter than a depend
Everytime we fuck, you go rough  like revenge
Everytime we fuck, you try 
I'm gon try to sing to it, when I get inside it
Roll and put my thing to it, from the back I put my brain to it
And my baby super bad, I think she jewish, oh yeah

Girl there ain't no question, I'll give you (?)
All you gotta do is call

Girl, I know you miss me when I'm on the road
Baby, we can do it wherever you wanna go
Baby, I would never let you leave me
And I got you, and that's the way it was meant to be
Baby girl them niggas, they be hating
But I don't really care, cause it's me and you
Them other bitches just look at they ffaces
They mad cause they can't pull up in that whip like you
Baby can I promis I won't leave?
That other nigga, baby he weak
And you know that I want you
So girl what you gon do?

Girl there ain't no question, I'll give you (?)
All you gotta do is call3Embed
