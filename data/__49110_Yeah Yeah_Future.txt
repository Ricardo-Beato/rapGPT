All-white bitch to match my all-white Louies
Millionaire frames hand-made; I'm just coolin'
Kid so fly say it shines like a movement
Bitch say I party hard, told her I make movies
Popcorn kush: no strings on ya coochie
Pop a DVD in, rollin, cruisin'
Yeah yeah... yeah, up there, swear
Wristwear cold, chande-lier

You see me, I see me too
Wristwear cold, bad bitches on me too
We don't do no one-on-ones, we fuck 'em by the twos
Man, you just got on one chain - you know we wear like two?

Whole 'lotta white equal a whole 'lotta riches
Whole 'lotta jew-els, I bought these for these bitches
Rocko Beckham: I know how to kick it!
Finessed you, babe? I'm sorry, like Vinny "I ain't in it"
Reign hell on these bitches, got plenty I'm like Tiger
That nigga say he hot as me? Lil' buddy a liar!
Jump out that new Jaguar, superjump my kayer
P Zero Nero, gon' pump up my tires
Rocko Dinero: I'm all about dinero
You know I keep that heat on me, no way you can creep on me
They was sleepin' on me, but now they workin for me
You see me? I see me too, bitch you can't ignore me

You see me, I see me too
Wristwear cold, bad bitches on me too
We don't do no one-on-ones, we fuck 'em by the twos
Man, you just got on one chain - you know we wear like two?

Mix-match my ice like I mix-match my hogs
Black, yellow,white I change 'em up like I change clothes
John Juliano cover for my eye sight
Everything black bout to kill niggas on sight
Everything fly bout to take flight outta sight
Bad bitch my type, two dykes, two nights
Two rights, can't deal Future no wrongs
ReRock stone like Fred Flintstone
Drinkin on lean two cups styrofoam
Two phones, I can't take these home
Cuz too many woman wanna call my phone
Leave me alone while I get my lean on
Blowin' on strong, sippin on 'tron
Throwin up money, rippin my zone
You see me, I see me too
Wristwear cold, bad bitches on me too
We don't do no one-on-ones, we fuck 'em by the twos
Man, you just got on one chain - you know we wear like two?
Yeah
