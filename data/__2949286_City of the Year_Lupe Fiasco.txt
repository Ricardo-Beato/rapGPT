Say these niggas ain't ridin' on low, oh
Push Benz through the bitch, ayy, and a nigga gotta go, oh
DROGAS, I need a trophy for this shit, dawg
I need a trophy for this shit

City of the year, city of the year, that's where I'm from
City of the year, city of the year, they don't want none
City of the year, city of the year, them hoes can't come
Go hard or go home, I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone
City of the year

Ayy, born in the middle of the West
Lil' nigga, livin' in the middle of death
Raised 'round killers, that's why little impress
I'm sorry white folks, if it sound I'm a little oppressed
And I'm sorry, my niggas, but I think you the best
You don't need no Khaled, 'cause that's on me, valid
Let me push my brother, we don't need no malice
Niggas raised in the projects, now they gon' need a palace
Niggas want JJ's, don't eat salads
Fourteen with a AK, and he'll let a nigga have it (raaah raaah)
Fireworks in K-Town, man it's so tragic
Fireworks on the lakefront, shit look like Magic
You might also like
City of the year, city of the year, that's where I'm from
City of the year, city of the year, they don't want none
City of the year, city of the year, them hoes can't come
Go hard or go home, I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone
City of the year

My city look pretty in the summer
6th grade, moved out to the hundreds
Prolly wouldn't have made it hangin' 'round my mama's
Harvey World where I made my come-up
Bishop was a BD, Dope claimed Lord
Cliqued all up, put it all on CD
Neutron don, but I prolly been a GD
God knows best, so he put me where he need me
Puttin' truth in all these rhymes
State tried to shut a nigga down, gave my nigga Chilly all that time
People think it came out of nowhere, it's all by design
They took away the chiefs and the streets lost their minds

City of the year, city of the year, that's where I'm from
City of the year, city of the year, they don't want none
City of the year, city of the year, them hoes can't come
Go hard or go home, I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone
City of the year
Turn up, let's get it
Turn up, life in the Windy City
Chiraq, Lupe, what up bro?
In the 'Go zone, in the 'Go zone

Go hard or go home, we turnt up (we turnt up)
I'm from Chiraq
When we come around, we rush stuff (we rush stuff)
I gotta keep that
Cause when I come around, they act tough (they act tough)
Chi Lupe, I'm so hard, I'm burnt up
City of the year, that's my shit, I'm ridin' 'round in traffic
Cdai, he got the mop stick, ain't shit change, I ain't quit
Ain't shit change, I ain't switch, I'm just smart, tryna get rich
I'm so high, you in a ditch, I'ma get mine, Money Makin' Mitch
You talkin' shit, you don't exist, I can leave you lost in the mist
I'm Rondo, real as it gets, either with me or you against

City of the year, city of the year, that's where I'm from
City of the year, city of the year, they don't want none
City of the year, city of the year, them hoes can't come
Go hard or go home, I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone
City of the year2Embed
