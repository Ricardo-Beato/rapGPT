17 ContributorsUnfamiliar Lyrics
What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..
Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..

Love never gave a limit, wait a minute, stay up in it
Every day we give it, play to win it, way we live it
My heart, you came to visit
Stay extended
The lap of love we lay up in it
Days is vivid same incentive
The way we hit it's like Will and Jada did it
A house is not a home unless we staying in it
Stay committed
I used to get around now I'm staying centered
Angels ascended, grounded, stay cemented
The mentality, we all casualties
I can't do this casually actually you challenge me
To balance me
Paid dues and salaries
Been through truths and fallacies
The unfamiliarity made me loose calories
In a house with wine playing Amy's "Valerie"
Then I realized the past ain't my reality
On love's balcony, you standing out for me
This is alchemy, unashamed and undoubtedly
Now I see
You might also like
What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..
Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..

This love's alive, it clicks the way that T.D. Jakes described it
Vivrant thing the way that Tip from Tribe would sing
So many things that you provide the king
You too fly, never should you hide your wings
The awakening, let's keep breaking things
Breaking rules, breaking laws, breaking through
Breaking walls, sacred thoughts
Are the oceans that we make it cross
The truth is a naked cloth
No need to take it off, the wait is off
Love we make and do is unbreakable, relatable
State in you relating to the faith in you
Awaken to what faith can do
Fate is inescapable, super friends, we capable
To take it to a greater view they say is unattainable
I paint for you a picture I'm forever in it with ya
Love it when we hang, in my life, you're a fixture
A mixture of love, laughter, scripture
The right elixir, my spirit I pour to enrich ya
I'm with ya
What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..
Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..1Embed
