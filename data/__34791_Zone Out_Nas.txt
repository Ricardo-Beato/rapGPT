55 ContributorsZone Out Lyrics
Braveheart for life
Zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
Uhh, Salaam Remi!
Yeah, zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out, what, yeah
Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
(I want y'all to blast on these niggas, man)
Zo-zo-zo zone out
Zo-zo-zo zone out

Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket
Here come the Braveheart straight out the projects
We live the life where the blood spills
Same thing that get you cash nigga, get you killed
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him
Pull out, brrrrrrrt, forehead yawning
Sloppy, droppin' you birds
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit, back in ya head, vomit
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals tryin' to wild nowadays I sold crack bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
Fuckin 'em hoes, boilin' coke since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray MAC-10 and a pocket full o' dimes
You might also like
Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas
Scared straight, but FUCK them hoes
Keep it, dead serious
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin'
Now you sleep with them fishes
G-W-I-Z, so delicious
To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts
I'm movin' on past you chumps, and very thorough
Promoted by God's Son
And this is the military turn it up
My Uzi weighs a ton, yo son less thump nah
Heat talk feet walk you run uh
Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come
Drop son, pull out
You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket
The peeps be like one (one)
I'm movin' on past you chumps, and very thorough promoted by God's Son

G-O-D S-O-N
I S-O-O-T-H-E a female's estrogen
With my testosterone, male hormone
Enough for a giant's body, science S-C-I-E-N-C-E
Don't tempt me, EMS against you, me I'm just, invincible
Like Mike Jack said
For me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem
That's dead, who made this style, Solo or X
Or you UTFO's Doctor or Moe Dee
Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death
I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas
Remember the, original, y'all still tryin' to show niggas ya rich
Town house niggas
I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries
Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired
Well picture us Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga itchin' to bust
You got a house in Virginia, the only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck
No need for the gun play, it's okay, 'cause you dyin' anyway
Yo, this is for them high school drop outs
Niggas in crow, who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' and you ain't turnin' back
Bravehearts gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have the bike on a bitch
Now I got the Jeep on the strip
Coke in the pot, heat on my hip

Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin'
Shoot 'til the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners
And that's Queensbridge nigga, all day
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze
Runnin' from D's quick to knockout rookies
G Wiz you know what I'm bout
To all my real niggas

Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out
Zo-zo-zo zone out, zo-zo-zo zone out2Embed
