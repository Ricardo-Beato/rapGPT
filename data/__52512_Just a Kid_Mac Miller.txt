They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it, we ridin' (Fuck it, we ridin')
Playin' games just to ease your mind
Damn, I'm high (Damn, I'm high)
And I know (I know) that they (That they) never understand
'Cause I'm just (I'm just) a kid (A kid), but they tell me I'm the man
(Hey, hey) Hey

I be goofy, kind of funny, actin' stupid, but they love me
We don’t do it for the money, just some food up in my tummy
Feelin' cool, livin' great, in the mood, tryna sway
Ice cubes in my drink, never doin' what they say
They some losers full of hate, the nuisance gettin' cake
What I'm doin' every day, probably ruin all your game
Got some brand new clothes, fresh, right out the package
The moon lookin' like I could reach right up and grab it
So close to the sky, I'm high
Was a youngin' who would hope to be fly, oh my
God, now I'm everywhere with my squad
When I spit a rhyme, they applaud
And I say, "Thank you, thank you, you're far too kind"
You heard everybody's music, but wait 'til you hear mine

They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it, we ridin' (Fuck it, we ridin')
Playin' games just to ease your mind
Damn, I'm high (Damn, I'm high)
And I know (I know) that they (That they) never understand
'Cause I'm just (I'm just) a kid (A kid), but they tell me I'm the man
(Hey) Hey

If you know me, you are hatin', listen, homie, I've been waitin'
For a golden opportunity to know that I'ma make it
Where I'm goin', I could take it, went from flowin' in the basement
To shows in all stages, on the road to different places
Got they thumbs in the air, smile on they faces
Fans with grey hair and fans rockin' braces
Fans who be buyin' me drinks to get me wasted
Groupie hoes, thirsty as hell and wanna taste it, heh
See, this life even shocks me
I got some people on my nuts, call 'em jockey, haha
And I ain't even gettin' cocky
But if you hatin', I'ma tell you this: Watch me
'Bout to do somethin' amazin', bro
World changin', my brain got a gang of flows
And this for those who always came to shows
And who were still by my side with no bank to blow, woah

They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it, we ridin' (Fuck it, we ridin')
Playin' games just to ease your mind
Damn, I'm high (Damn, I'm high)
And I know (I know) that they (That they) never understand
'Cause I'm just (I'm just) a kid (A kid), but they tell me I'm the man
