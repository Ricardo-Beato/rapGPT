(ISO)
(Oh wee, Oh!Zone on the beat)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know

Niggas looking for me, I'm somewhere smoking on dope (Smokin' on dope, smokin')
Instead of looking for me, you need to look for yo' hoe (Look for yo' hoe, for yo' hoe)
Brought the bank out with me, nigga, Wells Fargo (Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo)
Glo'd all up, pull up in a Gallardo
I know, I know, boy, I know, I know, boy, I know
Is it because my ice just bling like me?
And I know, I know, I know, I know, boy, I know
'Cause I'm getting guap, they don't like me and I know

I'm finna buy me a Diablo, sit it on Forgiatos
Coolin' with my padro, I mean coolin' with my vato
That's Sosa's guap though, got a lot of shots though
For a opp though, for a opp hoe
She can give me top though, then vamanos
Pull off in that 'Rari though
"Chief Sosa, you flexing," bitch, tell me something I don't know
I’m freestylin’ though, check my clothes, I ain't lying though
I know (I know), I know (I know), I know (I know), I know (I know)
100 thousand Ben Franklins is the only fucking G's that I know (Know)
I know (I know), I know (I know), I know (I know)
His bitch say she wanna hit the top, bitch, fuck with me, you might glo
You might also like
Niggas looking for me, I'm somewhere smoking on dope (Smokin' on dope, smokin')
Instead of looking for me, you need to look for yo' hoe (Look for yo' hoe, for yo' hoe)
Brought the bank out with me, nigga, Wells Fargo (Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo)
Glo'd all up, pull up in a Gallardo
I know, I know, boy, I know, I know, boy, I know
Is it because my ice just bling like me?
And I know, I know, I know, I know, boy, I know
'Cause I'm getting guap, they don't like me and I know10Embed
