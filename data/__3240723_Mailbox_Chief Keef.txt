Sosa, baby

No, I can't calm down, bitch I'm too turnt up
Judge gon' give me life, foe 'nem Murders
Sittin' at a red light, pourin' this purp' up
See the LVs on my boxers, while I'm liftin' my shirt up
Cops tryna search us, hoes tryna twerk us
Walk in with all this ice, did it on purpose
Got spice like red hot, need to keep ya tail tucked
Have folks nem deliver this to you, put it in ya mailbox

Niggas be really knowin', bitches be really goin'
Look up and the ceilin' gone, that ass I'm feelin' on
Gimme a Christina Milian, I could pop me a wheelie on
Bout to go get some more chains, like I ain't got enough jewelry on
Went to the trap last night, and I looked up it was dawn
Got a U-Haul backin' in, with equipment & more laundry
You know we ain't really for none, all I know is get paper
I know killas, and they owe me big favors
Bitches XO me like Weeknd, I'm somewhere out eating
Stay yo ass in 2 feet, or go yo ass on the deep end
Someone hand me an ashtray, that's my boys who passed away
Keep my mouth laminated, 'til the day I'm eliminated
You might also like
No I can't calm down, bitch I'm too turnt up
Judge gon' give me life, foe 'nem Murders
Sittin' at a red light, pourin' this purp' up
See the LVs on my boxers, while I'm liftin' my shirt up
Cops tryna search us, hoes tryna twerk us
Walk in with all this ice, did it on purpose
Got spice like red hot, need to keep ya tail tucked
Have folks nem deliver this to you, put it in ya mailbox

What's yo' address nigga? Where you live at nigga?
We ain't tryna hear that nigga, you know I'm a real ass nigga
Know I gotta get cash nigga, you know I want it real bad, nigga
My young niggas run down on you, treat you like a lil' ass nigga
Bitches see the ice, they see the cars, they see the bands they in the mood
They get in, into the spot, that's where the cars gon' take us to
I need top, I told them bitches that like it was breaking news
And you know I be about my chicken, bitch no Ramen noodles
Jail cell not even bigger than my pantry
We can't leave no trace I guess them gloves come in handy
It's lovely now, bitches be loving me now, aye
Had the bitch suckin' me up, she might end up shutting me down aye

No I can't calm down, bitch I'm too turnt up
Judge gon' give me life, foe 'nem Murders
Sittin' at a red light, pourin' this purp' up
See the LVs on my boxers, while I'm liftin' my shirt up
Cops tryna search us, hoes tryna twerk us
Walk in with all this ice, did it on purpose
Got spice like red hot, need to keep ya tail tucked
Have folks nem deliver this to you, put it in ya mailboxEmbed
