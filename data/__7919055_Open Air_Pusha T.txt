Sellin' cocaine in the open air, the boats is there
The notes is there, yeah, the ropes is there
They gonna die
You ready?

Out on the balcony, goats in chair
Just got the word that the coast is clear
So I'ma send it down the coast and load it there
Imagine hangin' on a prayer knowing dope's in there
All that frontin' in your raps, you holdin', where?
We turnin' on the lights, you roaches clear
Parking lot cemetery, it's Ghosts' therе
And depending how I feel, the chauffеur's there
Why would I do a turkey drive to troll the mayor
When we feed the projects for most of the year?
See, my heart been black, ain't no hope in here
And we been let down by who 'sposed to care
Me and Steven, gull wings, see, those is rare
Ain't no Tonys in my circles, we Sosas here
In these ten crack commandments, I'm Moses, yeah
ARs do your body like folding chairs, sit down

Sellin' cocaine in the open air, the boats is there
The notes is there, yeah, the ropes is there
You might also like
Bricks like blocks of government cheese
Seven hundred for the Japanese dungarees
VVS, V12s, don't fuck with my Vs
Highest price, hood bitches that scuff up they knees
Finally made your first million, but what's it to me?
Million-dollar dog collar, I'm pluckin' you fleas
See, none of those barkin' can fuck with the tree
And when they legalize that, the discussion's with me
Paris Le Meurice, the sprawling suite
His Cartier, her wrist Van Cleef, exes deceased, uh
AKA rest in peace
Her mother's worst fear is you die in the streets
Seventeen mind changers up under my seat
Jean-Georges reservations, I'm dyin' to eat
Then we toast with Sancerre, a sigh of relief
Watch you niggas blow it all just tryna compete

Sellin' cocaine in the open air, the boats is there
The notes is there, yeah, the ropes is there3Embed
