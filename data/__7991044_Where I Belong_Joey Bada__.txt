Uh, uh, uh-uh
Yeah (Static Selektah)

Back on the set like I never left
I'm takin' steps to be the best 'til they lay me to rest
VVS upon my chest, it got them devious
Ain't no tints on my two-door, I want them see it's us
'Cause if I paid enough, them fuckers better see me comin'
I used to drive my mama bucket, ridin' 'round frontin'
On Snyder Avenue, buildin' number thirty-four-hunnid
I gave this shit my all or nothin', now my bank bussin'
I'm livin' plush', new crib cost a milli' plus
Six figures on every art piece that's hangin' up
You little niggas still spendin' on the obvious
And if you think I'm flexin' now, just wait 'til I re-up
And just to sum it up, we shinin' all year long
When I was comin' up, they tried to tell me that was wrong
I had to run it up, and now I'm right where I belong
If all my niggas dead and gone, I gotta carry on

I pray the Lord have mercy on a nigga soul
We reminiscin', reminiscin' like it's all we know
Take hollow tips and extra clips everywhere we go
'Cause I be takin' risk every time that I hit the door
I pray the Lord have mercy on a nigga soul
We reminiscin', reminiscin' like it's all we know
Take hollow tips and extra clips everywhere we go
'Cause I be takin' risk every time that I hit the door

Yo
Tryna get my thoughts together
I say a prayer every day, hopin' it all get better
I talk to God a lot, these verses is like open letters
I know that nothin' really last forever
Like the past, the future don't exist, I know it's now or never
Focused on the present, know my presence is a gift
Just so happen to be good at rappin', that would be my niche
I was only like six when my cousin Richie Rich
Wrote my first verse for me that I would never forget
And since then I was never known to leave a microphone alone
Often took the long way home just to get thoughts off my dome
Mama blowin' up my phone, leave her message at the tone
I was gettin' in my zone, at times I felt so alone
Like how it feel to know that you the best and nobody know
Every punchline a chin check and a body blow
With all disrespect, you niggas still ain't fuckin' with me though
And never was
Every time they thought they had me down, I just leveled up

They all saw it
I'm from Brooklyn, I rep Brooklyn all day
They killed Biggie
Y'all niggas is killin' us and you fuckin'—
This world is about money, money revolve around money
Just know that I'm from Brooklyn
I pray the Lord have mercy on a nigga soul
We reminiscin', reminiscin' like it's all we know
Take hollow tips and extra clips everywhere we go
'Cause I be takin' risk every time that I hit the door

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you liked that?
