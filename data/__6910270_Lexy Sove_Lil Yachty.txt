20 ContributorsLexy Sove Lyrics
(And this beat from Cash, not from YouTube)

Look, this lil' bitch so sexy (Mmm)
And I'm thinking 'bout her breasts, I just want her next to me (Yeah)
I got twenty thousand dollars, I'm gon' throw it
Ain't gotta say it, she know I'm real, yeah, she know it (Know)
Sexy love, the things you do, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Two white Bentleys on the E-way, look like doves (Brr)
Uh, put her on a boat, now she bustin' (She be bustin')
Every time we finish fighting, we be fuckin’ (We be fuckin’)
We keep everything lowkey like Harriet ​Tubman (Harriеt Tubman)
Spread your legs in the bеd, Jumpman, Jumpman (Beep)
I'm gon' throw the lucky-uckys
Ridin' with them jackboys, I ain't Travis (Brrt)
Six figures flex stuffed in my mattress (Yeah)
And when you get drunk, that's when you nastiest (Yeah, yeah)
Soundin' out my adjectives (Yeah, yeah)
Blessed just like Nazareth
You're terrific

I need you, on the low (Yeah)
Fuck that, I need you, on the high (Mmm)
Fuck that, when I'm with you, I feel high (Yeah, yeah)
Baby girl, when I'm with you
Baby girl, baby girl, I got several issues (Mmm)
But right now, they nonexistent, only 'cause I'm with you (Yeah)
Kiss your forehead when you cry, could use my shirt for tissues (Mwah)
Know it's love, know it's love, sexy love, sexy love, I need you now
You might also like
Walkin' in Bottega heels, you deserve some mills (Woah)
Ask what's up off a pill, that shit give me chills (Bustin')
Can we make a movie reel? I won't show no one (Yeah)
Out in public with no bag, can you hold my gun? (Yeah)
We be kickin' it like Lil Keed, it's not no one-and-done (Yeah)
Way too smart, my lil' baby, you could show me somethin' (Yeah)
I like mine older (Mmm, go)
I need that, when you comin' over? (I need that)
And we both got our R's, mine a Rolls, hers a Rover
Know it's real 'cause I still wanna eat it when I'm sober (Yeah)
Scorpio lil' diva, born in late October (Mwah)
The girl of my dreams, hope I get to know her (Yeah)

I need you, on the low (Yeah)
Fuck that, I need you, on the high (Mmm)
Fuck that, when I'm with you, I feel high (Yeah, yeah)
Baby girl, when I'm with you
Baby girl, baby girl, I got several issues (Mmm)
But right now, they nonexistent, only 'cause I'm with you (Yeah)
Kiss your forehead when you cry, could use my shirt for tissues (Mwah)
Know it's love, know it's love, sexy love, sexy love, I need you now

It's us, mwah
Keep thatEmbed
