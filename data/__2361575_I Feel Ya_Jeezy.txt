13 ContributorsI Feel Ya Lyrics
Put your fam on your back boy I feel ya
Put your hood on the map boy I feel ya
You ain't got to say a word boy I hear ya
That shit you talking about sounds so familiar
Can't make a move without the strap boy I feel ya
Been up a month ain’t took a nap boy I feel ya
That shit you going through sounds so familiar
That’s why I feel ya

Nothing comes a surprise you got that blood in your eye
These bitches give you a chance you’ll take this world by surprise
Incarceration fatalities just a nigga reality
Know we moving the weight, know we ain't burning calories
Only got one chance and this is it
Or you gone be like your daddy and don't be shit
'Bout to take some shit that’s as deep as ocean water
Just left a funeral my nigga had to bury his daughter
You can get finessed by your partna and get shot by a coppa
Caught my lil cousin slippin' took off his leg with that choppa
You just go hard nigga and Imma go hard with ya
Then we gone meet at the spot and we gone drink hard liquor
(What's happening niggaaa)

Put your fam on your back boy I feel ya
Put your hood on the map boy I feel ya
You ain't got to say a word boy I hear ya
That shit you talking about sounds so familiar (Yeahhhhh)
Can't make a move without the strap boy I feel ya
Been up a month ain’t took a nap boy I feel ya
That shit you going through sounds so familiar
That’s why I feel ya
You might also like
We know they don’t give a damn we gives a fuck
Every time this world knocks us down we get back up (what up)
I just wanna come and buy a crib for my momma
Let her know her oldest son sorry for the drama
Just know I even shit with that 40 I gotta have it
Only thing that kept me alive guess that’s a habit
Cause niggas starving out here boy like this shit is Ramadan
My city is a war zone call it Little Vietnam
R.I.P to Peanut rest in peace Lil Kev
Can't forget Lil Mike he use to roll em all night movie
Free my nigga Neecho, Took care of the hood so he a neighborhood hero (Whats happening nigga)

Put your fam on your back boy I feel ya
Put your hood on the map boy I feel ya
You ain't got to say a word boy I hear ya
That shit you talking about sounds so familiar (Yeahhhhh)
Can't make a move without the strap boy I feel ya
Been up a month ain’t took a nap boy I feel ya
That shit you going through sounds so familiar
That’s why I feel yaEmbed
