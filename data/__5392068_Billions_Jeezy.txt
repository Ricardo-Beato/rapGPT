4 ContributorsBillions Lyrics
Say, bruh, turn me up a little bit
Aha, yeah, that's Shawty Redd
He engineerin’ tonight

Oprah got a billion, Puffy got a billion
Hov got a billion, I just want a billion
Y'all can chase them hoes, nigga, I just want a billion
Y'all can buy them clothes, nigga, I just want a billion
Warren got a billion, Mark got a billion
Dre got a billion, I just want a billion (Billion)
Y’all can chase them hoes, nigga, I just want a billion (Billion)
Y'all can buy them clothes, nigga, I just want a billion

In a khaki Dickies suit, ain't no fashion 'round me (Nah)
Keep your word, tell the truth, ain't no cappin' 'round me (Woo)
Show up with them Power Rangers, yeah, they zap around me (Boom-boom)
Got a mean front line, Warren Sapp around me (Yeah)
I be dreamin' ’bout the block, I be grindin’ in my sleep (Ayy)
How your mouth full of diamonds but your talk still cheap? (Ha-ha)
Nigga postin' all them cars, but you’re leasin' that fleet (Yeah)
Steady rappin' 'bout your hoes, but you’re payin' that freak (Ayy)

Oprah got a billion, Puffy got a billion
Hov got a billion, I just want a billion
Y'all can chase them hoes, nigga, I just want a billion
Y'all can buy them clothes, nigga, I just want a billion
Warren got a billion, Mark got a billion
Dre got a billion, I just want a billion (Billion)
Y'all can chase them hoes, nigga, I just want a billion (Billion)
Y'all can buy them clothes, nigga, I just want a billion

Yeah, I just left Neiman's, bought up all the black tees (Tees)
Just a playa from the south still try to stack G's (Yeah)
I'm just tryna meet my quota, maybe stack a mil' a week
Tax-free to IRS, they'll probably get me in my sleep (Damn)
I just met with my accountant, told that motherfucker count it (Ayy)
Told my lawyer, "Watch my lawyer", told 'em both, "Watch my accountant" (Ha-ha)
Nigga postin' all them cars, but you're leasin' that fleet
Steady rappin' 'bout your hoes, but you're payin' that freak (Let's go)

Oprah got a billion, Puffy got a billion
Hov got a billion, I just want a billion
Y'all can chase them hoes, nigga, I just want a billion
Y'all can buy them clothes, nigga, I just want a billion
Warren got a billion, Mark got a billion
Dre got a billion, I just want a billion (Billion)
Y'all can chase them hoes, nigga, I just want a billion (Billion)
Y'all can buy them clothes, nigga, I just want a billionEmbed
