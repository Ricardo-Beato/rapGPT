2 ContributorsCrumblinâ€™ Erb Freestyle Lyrics
Sour Hour
DJ Shef
Man, I hit the weed way too much, shit, let me get to the song
A lotta y'all probably know this
Had to put my own little twist on it
Ahem
Aight, Jerm, ya ready?

Uh
Well, it's the motherfuckin' M to the A-C, M to the I
Double-L, E-R, fallin' from the sky 'til I land
Crash into this planet, skippin' through the universe, I vanish
And disappear, wise beyond my years
Ridin' through the streets but too high to even steer, so I hover
Three hundred feet from the ground
And I don't plan on comin' down
You run around like a chicken with his head cut off
I'm havin' chickens, give me head, no special 
I'm on my pimp shit, swimmin' through 
Let a thick bitch give me brains, watch a chick-flick
Somethin' About Mary, nut in her hair
Her mom hear us, but I don't give a fuck if she there
Learned that life's a bitch, and nothin' is fair
So I focus on my money, get enough I can share
And get me drunk, I don't care, I pass the money to my team
'Cause they all be by my side while I'm huntin' for this dream
Nothin' what it seem in a dreamland
And I ain't growin' up, call me Peter Pan
Givin' you the news like C-SPAN
Tryna ball, ESPN, and
Haha, I'm way over my limit
Cracked a Dutchie down the middle, throw some haze in it
I'm gone, and I might be back to visit
Add a ho, subtract the clothes, Mac the mathematician, haha
So what the fun in that?
When my liver shriveled up and my lungs is black
But, livin' free, I ain't done with that
'Cause I'ma keep chiefin' 'til my lungs collapse, ayy
So what's the matter with that? Uh
What's the matter with that?
And everybody boyfriend is a sissy, so the bitches heard she kiss me
She wanna stick around like a hickey but I'm busy
Just makin' music, hittin' sticky 'cause it lift me
Bitch, I got more talents than the homie Mr. Ripley
As a youngin, knew that hip-hop was in me
At fifteen, dropped a mixtape and it was iffy
Worked to get better, took my time when I was sixteen
So now you say my name at any party and you in free
Still a youngin, in discussion like a grown man
Lil' munchkins got a hunch that I'm a gold ham
I'ma blow, damn, time to be my own man
Bunch of fine hoes chillin', feelin' up the whole van
I don't fuck 'em just 'cause they supportin' me, hell
It's no biggy, they just lookin' for a story to tell
No groupie gettin' glory, ain't doin' nothin' for me
That's why I never let 'em stay the morning
I just open up my eyes when I wake, and I bake
On my grind, stayin' scruffy, never shavin' my face
A lotta time on my hands, never takin' a break
'Cause Sheffy hit me up with some paper to make
I'ma take my time, grind until the day I die
My weed the flavor lime, gettin' high, chase the sky
You see the paper  shit
So please, keep your distance like an eighth grade dance, bitch
You might also like
Hahaha, chyeah
See, man, sometimes I just like to
Just spit, haha
Crumblin' Erb and shit
Big Jerm, you can cut that, uh, right about... hereEmbed
