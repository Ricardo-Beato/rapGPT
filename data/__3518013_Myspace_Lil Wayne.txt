Work your elbo, let me see you work your elbo
Work your elbo, let me see how you work your elbo
Bitch, give me my space, bitch, give me my space
Bitch, give me my space, bitch, give me my space

You know I'm strapped up, when I come through
Bout twenty deep, lil nigga, make room
Hit the stage up, hala at the DJ
He goin play my shit back to back, like a replay
Got my money right, you already know
I'm in the club, shootin dice up, bettin on the four
Fresh kicks, I pick them up overseas
Five-fifty for a pare, you ain't got enough for these
And I'm feelin shauty, that's a bad bitch
And her ass thick, I wanna smash quick
Take her to the telly, do the grown up
Or in the Chevy, to the levy, to the morning
Shit, I get it poppin, like popcorn
And I done been hot, and you ain't warm
And you can get mad, but this is how we do it
First, you throw your hands up, and get to it

Work your elbo, let me see you work your elbo
Work your elbo, let me see how you work your elbo
Bitch, give me my space, bitch, give me my space
Bitch, give me my space, bitch, give me my space

I'm Geed up, they already know
But I ain't too gangsta, to swing my elbos
See, I say Dizzy, but I'm a Mack, Maine
We got Curren$y, they call us Young MoneyEmbed
