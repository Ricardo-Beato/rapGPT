18 ContributorsFlying Coach Lyrics
I can’t love her, ‘cause she like a ghost
That bitch that do the most
She like ... ghost
I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most
Oh!

I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
We fly business; you mad ‘cause you flying coach, (lil bitty bitch) yeah you flying coach

I got so many decisions, ravens fly with the pigeons
I beat the pot, while you be the witness, try me – we don’t aim at kidneys
I throw back a perc’ to call my tensions; we pipe it up in the city
I got your hoe in my DM’s; I got your hoe at my mentions
The plug, he live in my mansion
He got bitches in the kitchen dancing
Then they gone for a month
Then go to trapping all the way in Kansas
Nigga never rode a transit
Hit the pot, like a canvas
Feeling like Jamie Foxx, ‘cause I’m in love with a bitch named Fancy
This game is dirty like a fucking Banshee
When I started getting money, now you can’t stand me
I almost lost my life, one night in Miami
I go back to Miami, drinking out the hammock
You might also like
I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
We fly business; you mad ‘cause you flying coach, (lil bitty bitch) yeah you flying coach

I cannot love her, that bitch do the most
Want to slam my door, what you mad at me for?
Mad ‘cause I didn’t let you come to my show
But you calling my phone, standing at my front door
Is you mad ‘cause I didn’t take you serious, hoe?
Comedian bitch, you delirious, hoe
Kill yourself, jump off the building
I walk in the kitchen, grab the knife, and go slit your throat
I don’t do favors; you know that’s a no
Fucked them up on the dab, going up on the show
Kicking a door, when the bando get slow
F-f-f-fuck up the pot, they want more
These bitches fucking for (zero)
These bitches give it up
I guess you want lust for the trust
I’m like a squirrel; I just want me a nut
Take the pot and I give it an uppercut
Most of these niggas be dick riding nowadays
Tell these niggas to wrap it up
Like an octopus, I’m getting money in eight ways
Young Takeoff, my stack is up
Since I remember, two years ago made ‘em say bando
Now they say pipe it up
Remember they talked down and doubted us
Now when I walk the Earth, I make the street erupt
I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
We fly business; you mad ‘cause you flying coach, (lil bitty bitch) yeah you flying coach

I can’t be loving this hoe
This bitch like the green light; this bitch like to go
I gave her the Beamer; I gave her the Rolls
But this little bitch still gon’ creep on her toes
I see the moves, so I watch how I move
She fucking niggas; she tryna’ to be cool
She broke as a bitch; she got nothing to lose
Giving it up just to put on some Loub’s
How can I lie, bet that thing like a pool
All of these bitches be loving the crew
Ain’t no one on one we fuck by the two
YRN fashion, I’m dabbing on you
You mad at me now, so I’m laughing at you
You something to do; you get hit in a room
Mama told me not to jump over broom
They hungry for money, they tryna’ get grooms
I like this bitch; she got an attitude
I think that I like the bitch, but I can’t wife the bitch
I’m in a Lambo, look what racks do
Whipping up crack; I can make a deuce
Bringing it back, make a brick turn to two
Bringing it back, make a brick turn to two!
I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
We fly business; you mad ‘cause you flying coach, (lil bitty bitch) yeah you flying coachEmbed
