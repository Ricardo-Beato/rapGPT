4 Contributors...So Addictive Lyrics
I know some of y'all sick of songs y'all be hearin' on the radio, oh (Oh)
So me and Timbaland gon' give that shit you never heard before
(Shit you never heard before, oh)
It's like drinkin' liquor or weed or X, whatever does you the best
My beats are so (So) addictive
Come on, get krunk with me
See if you're ridin' down the street
And you're 'bout to roll that shit up
You don't need drugs or weed
Oh nah, you ain't smokin' that stank shit up in my car
Get your feet off my dashboard
Come on, get krunk with me
Oh yeah, you wanna get krunk though?
Well, pop this CD in right here and take a hit of me (My album is so addictive)
'Cause my album is so addictive
Man, bump this ballad shitYou might also likeEmbed
