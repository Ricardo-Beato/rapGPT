12 ContributorsHoly Water Lyrics
Po' up Nig
Feeling blessed in this motherfucker you know
Amen Amen (that boy cash)
What's up

Money is the root of all evil sometimes we get weak
Grind 7 whole days feel like I been sinning all week
Drunk soul speaking sober mind nigga what you really tryna say
Every day pay day my nigga what’s the motherfucking play

Just cashed my check boy I’m bout to go get me some holy water
Hit the club straight flex cuz we holding up them bottles of that holy water
Liquor store closed yea yea I need me a 5th of that holy water
Yeah you know its on deck yeah we takin straight shots of this holy water

I said it's been a long week so I’m taking shot straight to the head
One time for my niggas walked out the penitentiary came home got right back to the bread
Mack 11 hit them in with the nose lookin like an uzi
Keep some real ones with me I be moving like Tookie
It's that super nigga music bout to put on my cape
What you blowin my nigga all gas no brakes
Big smoke clouds looking like I’m in Heaven
Came to bring the good word you can call me the reverend
When you do flaw shit then you just a flaw nigga
And if you talk like this you just a raw nigga
Mix it all up Avion and the Hennesesy
Stay prayed up because the devil is the enemy
Won't see no evil I don’t hear none either
Pussy cool credit good then she might be a keeper
One of these Sundays I need to go to church
But them bills keep comin so I gotta go to work
Flesh of my flesh, nigga blood of my blood
No gloves on I got mine out the mud
What up Young, what up though, boy you good, yeah im straight
Knowing damn well that a nigga don’t drink no brown big cup I’m about to seal my fate
You might also like
Just cashed my check boy I’m bout to go get me some holy water
Hit the club straight flex cuz we holding up them bottles of that holy water
Liquor store closed yea yea I need me a 5th of that holy water
Yeah you know its on deck yeah we takin straight shots of this holy water

Money is the root of all evil sometimes we get weak
Grind 7 whole days feel like I been sinning all week
Drunk soul speaking  sober mind nigga what you really tryna say
Every day pay day my nigga what’s the motherfucking play

I swear this motherfucka so packed in man that a nigga can't breathe
Plus I got my whole Cousins Gangster and these three Disciples with me like Babylon a nigga can't leave
615, 223, extendo, that 40
Even though that street life hell gotta make it home to my lil angel that’s all I know
Straight shots out the bottle cause it help a nigga cope
Got a brand new bottle got bless a nigga folk
Every hood every city treat a nigga like the Pope
All colors say the word it could give a nigga hope
Ain't nothing else to say when you said it all nigga
Just an ordinary day you a superstar nigga
And we ain't chasing shit we mix paint with the hood
Surprised why all this champagne in this pitcher
Street politician talking street politics
Gotta keep the fuck niggas all out your mix
Hanging with the wrong nigga type shit get you killed
Get you with the verdict gotta file for appeal
Why the fuck would you change, just be who you are nigga
Trials and your tribulations tell us what you saw nigga
We own expensive champagne we ain't even in Rome
I’m on this holy water taking shots to the dome, go
Money is the root of all evil sometimes we get weak
Grind 7 whole days feel like I been sinning all week
Drunk soul  speaking  sober mind nigga what you really tryna say
Every day pay day my nigga what’s the motherfucking play

Just cashed my check boy I’m bout to go get me some holy water
Hit the club straight flex cuz we holding up them bottles of that holy water
Liquor store closed yea yea I need me a 5th of that holy water
Yeah you know its on deck yeah we takin straight shots of this holy water
Take shots to this nigga
Put that pussy nigga (what's up) holy waterEmbed
