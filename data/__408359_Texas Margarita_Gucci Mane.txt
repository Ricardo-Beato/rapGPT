(We got London On Da Track!)
What's hadnin'
It's Guwop in this bitch
Got my nigga Thug with me
I got Dolph with me
Got London On Da Track
Sean engineering
Got Phil in with us, po' up!
Turn up, sideways, Guwop

I'm spillin' oil like an oil spill, nigga
And my diamonds match my car wheels, nigga
And I'm flipping like a cartwheel, nigga
Bricksquad, we a cartel nigga
(Ayyyyy)
Fuck talking let the rubber bands get cha
Big dog I let a bunch of runts sick ya, sick ya
Got choppers on the wall like pictures
Put the pistol in ya mouth like dentures
Surveillance cameras at the spot motion sensors
Not just a boss, I'm motherfucking member
See I'm the owner and a motherfucking soldier
And tell your bitch I'll be gone in November
As a matter of fact I came home in September
Tell the truth, January , I remember
And plus my watch February, December
The big lion in the hood like' Simba
Plus I got niggas that dress in all black just like ninjas
With no nunchucks, nigga just extensions
I brought my n* Snoop Lion some of the best zip
Pimp C niggas like they come from Texas
You might also like
30 days flat, made a hundred off the reefer
Drinking on that Pimp C, Texas Margarita
I only smoke the best
Don't give a fuck who got it cheaper
Drinking on that DJ Screw
Texas Margarita
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
I put too much syrup in the bottle
Put me in a sleeper
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
Driving fast cars
Dranking Texas Margarita

Drank syrup till I'm dizzy
Ready to die I'm bumping Biggie
Pour 5-0s in one liter
Now my sprite filthy
Drinking on Texas maragrita
And the bitch with me she a molly eater
But I like the lil trick that she do with her tongue
So I got to keep her
Money call my phone, I pour up a cup
And then I gotta leave her
All my hoes stay mad at me
I keep em hot
Guess they got a fever
Looking at my rearview camera
Making sure its my two seater
Just missed a show and went to jail
For a cup of lean
Nigga fuck the people
I ain't tripping my nigga don't take no time to make no bond
Roll one up
Jumping up in the coupe
Pull up in the hood like uh
This Margarita straight mud
You can taste it
What's in that ginger ale
Actavis what it's laced with
30 days flat, made a hundred off the reefer
Drinking on their Pimp C Texas Margarita
I only smoke the best
Don't give a fuck who got it cheaper
Drinking on that DJ Screw
Texas Margarita
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
I put too much syrup in the bottle
Put me in a sleeper
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
Driving fast cars
Dranking Texas Margarita

Codeine in my styrofoam
DJ Screw what I be on
My temper short but my money long
No girlscout only smoke strong
I call ya bitch when I want dome
Drop her off and get my juug on
I'm gettin money on three phones
Boost, Metro, and the iPhone
When I'm dirty nigga I'm ridin alone
Before I bend a corner put my blinker on
I'ma rape the city if I make it home
Buy an Aston Martin paint it all chrome
Give me one hour, have them Forgi's on
With a Spanish bitch rolling out our zone
Versace dress with no panties on
Red bottoms and Chanel cologne
30 days flat, made a hundred off the reefer
Drinking on their Pimp C Texas Margarita
I only smoke the best
Don't give a fuck who got it cheaper
Drinking on that DJ Screw
Texas Margarita
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
I put too much syrup in the bottle
Put me in a sleeper
Texas Margarita, Texas Margarita
Driving fast cars
Dranking Texas MargaritaEmbed
