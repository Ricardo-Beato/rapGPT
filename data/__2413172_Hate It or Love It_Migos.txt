I copped the coupe then I blew out the brain, ayy (Skrrt, skrrt, ayy)
I fuck a hoe then I don't know her name, ayy (Smash, smash, ayy)
I got some niggas that gon' ride to the end
Forgive me Lord, I repent all my sins (Ooh)
Hate it or love it, we winning again and again and again and again
I copped the coupe then I blew out the brain, ayy (Skrrt, skrrt, ayy)

I fuck on her one time, she want me to stay (I fuck on her one time, she want me to stay)
I'm pitchin' hardball like I play with the Braves (I'm pitchin' hardball like I play with the Braves)

Didn't nobody touch it, it lookin' amaze (Nobody touched it, that's right)

Fuck them rap niggas, don't fuck with the industry

Fuck niggas having them feminine tendencies
Really you niggas just envy me
Niggas be sneak dissing, think they offending me
YRN 2, the rich niggas, they feelin' me
I can't stand broke niggas 'cause they be killing me
Niggas they hate me 'cause they can’t get rid of me

Don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout? I mean mentally (Mentally)
My diamonds come from Elliot Avianne, you get your diamonds from Tiffany (Bitches be)
Hate or love it, my niggas we get the top, my nigga, and we turned nothin' to something (Huh)
You can talk down all you wanna
But you cannot stop my God when them blessings be coming (Nah)

Talkin' 'bout Karma when I'm out in Tijuana (Ayy)
My niggas, they keep it one hundred
Hate it or love it, my niggas, they get to the money (Ayy)
