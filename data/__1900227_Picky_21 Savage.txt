22 ContributorsPicky Lyrics
(Damn, DJ Plugg, you just killed it)

I'm so motherfucking picky
She ain't fucking then she dipping
If it ain't tinted, I ain't in it
'Cause I'm so motherfucking picky
Thousand dollars on Giuseppe's
You better watch where you stepping
I'm young, dumb and I'm reckless
Eighty thousand on a necklace
'Cause I'm so motherfucking picky

I'm fucking picky, 21 Savage, all I do is count digits
I cook a brick, I flip a brick, I fucking whip it
I hit Lenox, spend ten, I'm fucking ridiculous
I pulled up on his bitch, she acting stiff
Bitch, you better suck a dick or you got to dip
I got real shooters 'round me, they gon' fucking flip
You don't see this fucking extendo, better watch your lip
'Cause we'll trip, nigga
The money come first and these bitches last, nigga
I like counting cash, nigga, I like smoking gas, nigga
200 on the dash, nigga, all my cars fast
All my bitches thick, I love a fat ass
You might also like
I'm so motherfucking picky
She ain't fucking then she dipping
If it ain't tinted, I ain't in it
'Cause I'm so motherfucking picky
Thousand dollars on Giuseppe's
You better watch where you stepping
I'm young, dumb and I'm reckless
Eighty thousand on a necklace
'Cause I'm so motherfucking picky

I'm young dumb and I'm reckless
I'm playing with blocks like Tetris
I don't tote Smith & Wesson
This a Glock .40 get to stepping
This dope came from Peru, I got a deuce, deuce in my shoe
I got Santan', wanna boot?
I bought my side ho a coupe, that bitch came with no roof
These niggas lying, I'm the truth (21, 21, 21)
21 Savage, I'm in love with the money
Got a hundred round drum, on the bottom of my Tommy
Pow, pow, pow, grah, grah, grah
Pussy-nigga get to running, boot up, boot up, like a motherfucking zombie

I'm so motherfucking picky
She ain't fucking then she dipping
If it ain't tinted, I ain't in it
'Cause I'm so motherfucking picky
Thousand dollars on Giuseppe's
You better watch where you stepping
I'm young, dumb and I'm reckless
Eighty thousand on a necklace
'Cause I'm so motherfucking picky13Embed
