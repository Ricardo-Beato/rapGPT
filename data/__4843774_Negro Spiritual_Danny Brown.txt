I'm on par like Tiger with two white broads (Step)
Off three Xanax, drunk driving in the rental car (Yeah)
Boutta hit her with my best shot, like Pat Benatar (Hit her with your best shot)
One got big tits, one got ass like centaur (Step)
I been hard, mix Cialis with liquor (Ah), we been on
Skin but it ain't winter (Yeah), you ain't know (No)
Hoes look like centerfold (Oh), I'm so cold (Oh)
Pussy slippery like a winter road (Oh), just lay low (Low)
Gettin' heated like winter gloves (Oh), here we go (Yeah)
Birds on me like scarecrow (Oh), I don't know (Yo)
Told you, "You are special," oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Think you better call MACO, I'm on a spaceship
Leg up, like Fabo, I guess so (Step)
Who care what you say, so, you ain't slow (Step)
Nigga better quit playin', bro, 'fore I blow
.44 make you XO (Step)

You gon' get what you ask for (Ask for)
You gon' get what you ask for (Ask for)
You gon' get what you ask for (Ask for)
You gon' get what you ask for (Step)

All these niggas gettin' physical (Step)
On the outside, lookin' spiritual (Step)
So hard for me, I took the backroads
I took the backseat (Seat), I'm at your back door, huh
All these niggas gettin' physical (Yeah)
On the outside, lookin' spiritual (Yeah)
I make it hard, backseat (Step)
I took the back route (Step)
I took the backroads (Step, let me hear that?)

On my wrists is vintage (Yeah), and it's mint condition (Yeah)
Came a long way from not havin' a pot to piss in (Yeah)
Season tickets for the Pistons, cut crack on dishes
Every dream I have, I live it (Step)
Nigga what's the business? Tell me what's happening
Came a long way from coppin' eighths to half a rack (Step)
Know I'm the latest fashion, jacket made her crash (Ah)
Game was full of lames so I made a few extractions (Huh)
It's the microphone magician, make the rappers disappear (Yeah)
If I ain't holler at you yet, then you had a good year (Yeah)
I'm in Bergdorf with my shirt off, tell your ho to take her skirt off (Yeah)
I get the head, then there's nothin' else to talk 'bout (Step)
So fuck who you talk bout (Fuck), nigga, get choked out (Step)
Keep the same clothes for three days in the dope house (Yeah)
And my knuckles so long, shit look like a slinky (Ha)
My nigga said he had a lick, now he ain't never link me (Fuck)

All these niggas gettin' physical (Step)
On the outside, lookin' spiritual (Step)
So hard for me, I took the backroads
I took the backseat (Seat), I'm at your back door, huh
All these niggas gettin' physical (Yeah)
On the outside, lookin' spiritual (Yeah)
I make it hard, backseat (Step)
I took the back route (Step)
I took the backroads (Step, let me hear that?)6Embed
