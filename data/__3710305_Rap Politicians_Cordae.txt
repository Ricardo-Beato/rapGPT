13 ContributorsRap Politicians Lyrics
For instance, the average so-called Negro, he doesn't think that he can go into business and provide jobs for himself
And because of this, he thinks that he can only get a job from the White man
Or he can only get clothes from the White man, or he can only get food from the White man

Uh, we're takin' over the the racist motive, the hatred's older
The empire's retired, I'm just an ageist Yoda
Get some powder and baking soda, don't take the culture
They flip faster than racing motors. I'm made to blow up
If you don't understand now, then you will later
I'm from a place where they bust Glocks and steal paper
Nah, I'm talking assassination, they kill mayors
But can't overtake me because my skill's greater
Rap politician. Nominate my Congress
Never understood the Obama-hating nonsense
Black president. Dog, you hever had an option
'Cause, boy, I go monster way better than the Loch Ness
Let's get back to the subject: Blacks in the public
It seems like all other rap doesn't touch it
See, I tend to be the industry's redheaded stepchild
I've spoken too much. I'm surprised I'm not dead now

'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around
But I've always wondered (I wonder)
Yeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)
If we'll ever make it
Shit that we're facing
These rap politicians
The game is getting basic
Yeah
You might also like
You see, these rap politicians are really something else
They start blowing all their funds moment they discover wealth
I mean, cop another belt. Shit, maybe even two
'Cause if you're not wearing designer, then crazy, you
When actuality, these guys are lazy goofs
They're the type to go dap a Piru in baby blue
Straight stupid. And these are the niggas who make music
Influence a generation, nobody relates to it
Nigga, now you see the problem? Do you see the trouble?
They're fucking up our brains for generational struggles
That black waitress works doubles just to get by
'Cause her son needs some Jordans, dog, just to get fly
I used to smoke an eighth a day, nigga, just to get high
And Nelqueisha didn't get the job that Jessica got
And when we get the 9 to 5s, we become satisfied
Amend the rap politics. Constitution ratified

'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around
But I've always wondered (I wonder)
Yeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)
If we'll ever make it
Shit that we're facing
These rap politicians
The game is getting basic
Yeah
It's time to overthrow this government. Military coup
'Cause if we don't soon, they'll still bury you
And the first plan of action: Man, y'all gotta stop the shooting
And no dickriding, that's technically prostitution
No backwards progression, always constant movement
Everything is in your hands, you just gotta grind to do it
But first things first needs diplomatic correction
'Cause rappers like me in the systematic oppression
Huey Newton of this rap shit. Y'all don't understand me
The same reason why Nas and Snoop still don't have a Grammy
Why you gotta blow thousands when you fly to Miami?
And why you can't be a rapper if you drive in a Camry?
They make it uncool to budget, want us blowing our cash
Then Uncle Sam makes us broke again when taking our tax
So depressed from this hex they supply in prescriptions
Modern day drug war, these rappers fighting addiction

'Cause they got dead bodies in the street
Niggas on a leash
Facts show they want us all diseased
'Cause I found dead bodies on the ground
Niggas, not a sound
The cameras and the lights come around
But I've always wondered (I wonder)
Yeah, I've always wondered (Always wondered)
If we'll ever make it
Shit that we're facing
These rap politicians
The game is getting basic
Yeah
Listen, man, I ain't gonna lie, this shit is ass
This shit is not good
I need some coonery in my life
I'm tired of this black power, woke shit
Aight? You gonna have to cut all that shit out, B
Seriously, I needs the crank
Yes, that's what I'm looking for, the word "crank"
I needs that
That is not this
This shit is ass. Turn it off
Not a good song (Ass)
Trash (Garbage)
Garbage (Boo-boo, stank-stank)
