9 ContributorsBachelor Pad Lyrics
Gangsta Grillz
See, Barack O'Drama, I've been running the streets for about umm... five years
But I got a new running mate
Gucci, you with me? Hahaha
It's Gangsta Grillz

Shawty want to stay in my bachelor pad (You get ahead of the blockhouse)
Want to slow dance in my mansion
Shawty want to stay in my bachelor pad (It's Gucci)
But I'm a bachelor and I'm happy (Gangsta Grillz, Gangsta Grillz)
In my bachelor pad (What it do baby?, Gangsta Grillz)
And I'm happy (I'm happy)
I never felt too bad in my bachelor pad cause I'm trappin'

Shawty hotter than a hippopotamus in the Sahara (Hot)
With a rump like a rhinoceros just like Toccara (Rump)
An ass like a noscrologist, I need a telescope
I asked her what's her Zodiac so I can read her horoscope (Hmm)
Back bent and she switch it like she practice (Do it)
She acting, so I'm attacking, try break the mattress
Sexy, so I suggested to switch to sideways (Switch)
Pounded for about a hour she said she tired (Yawn)
At first she wouldn't acknowledge me, but now she can't get off of me (It's Gucci)
She done got a load of me, I freak her on my office desk (Well, damn)
I was goin medium she told me do it faster (Faster)
I gave her what she asked for and drove her like my fast car (Vroom)
