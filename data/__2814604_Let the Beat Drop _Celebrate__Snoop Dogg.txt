Let me blow the smoke all in the air
You know it's a party when Snoop's here
The ladies let their hair go down low
We let the whole club lights down low
Down low
In the BBM
She checkin' for my name in the BBM
I used to want a all black Beamer then
She don't really know how I seen her then
The west coast light, she ain't seen it yet
She ain't seen it yet
Fuck it, let's celebrate
Screw it, let's celebrate
Fuck it, let's celebrate
Snoop Dogg, we celebrate
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop

All about this paper while I'm rollin' up this paper, though
In case you didn't know, I'm blowin' on that high endo
Swizzy told me let it go, so I'm-a act a fool tonight
I'm in the building and I'm coolin' and I'm chillin' like
Never felt this way before, so I guess I'm-a let it go
Since I'm-a let it go, you better get ready for
More than the incredible, teach her what you gotta
Came for a little but I left with a whole lotta
Walked to the top but I started from the bottom
Celebrate tonight by raisin' up your fuckin' bottles
Smoke in the air, now everybody take a swallow
Snoop Dogg is that nigga you should follow
You might also like
Let me blow the smoke all in the air
You know it's a party when Snoop's here
The ladies let their hair go down low
We let the whole club lights down low
Down low
In the BBM
She checkin' for my name in the BBM
I used to want a all black Beamer then
She don't really know how I seen her then
The west coast light, she ain't seen it yet
She ain't seen it yet
Fuck it, let's celebrate
Screw it, let's celebrate
Fuck it, let's celebrate
Snoop Dogg, we celebrate
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop

Baby let her hair down when she heard that I was comin'
I can be your nigga, are you down to be my woman?
This is real pimpin', California, why you runnin'?
The other dudes fakin', baby, I keep it one hundred
Straight shooter with the Buddha, take a hit and get your mind right
Offered me some head, I told that little bitch that I might
In the mean time, let me bust and get my green right
We a hundred deep, goddamn I got my team right
We celebratin' lovin' this life
Your favorite rapper back up on the mizzic
From the underground to the roof, ya'll
It's your friendly neighborhood big Snoop Dogg
You know it's a party when Snoop's here
The ladies let their hair go down low
We let the whole club lights down low
Down low
In the BBM
She checkin' for my name in the BBM
I used to want a all black Beamer then
She don't really know how I seen her then
The west coast light, she ain't seen it yet
She ain't seen it yet
Fuck it, let's celebrate
Screw it, let's celebrate
Fuck it, let's celebrate
Snoop Dogg, we celebrate
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat drop
Now let the beat dropEmbed
