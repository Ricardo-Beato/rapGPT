25 ContributorsAllustrious Lyrics
Prodigy, H-A-V-O-C
M-O-B-B, uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
KnowhatI'msayin? 41st side
Niggas know how we do, right right
I can see you back there, yeah (whattup?)
Yo

The Mobb'll spit that shit, rip that bitch, leave it loose
Take shit back to trip who fat Goose
Queensbridge representative, ghetto entrepeneur, stay on tour
Dick-riders wanna get abortions
The same law, same day contract, different clause
Don't run red lights, I never caught the blue balls
Gold medalist spit, doin' this ever since
Third time felon, nigga, who you tellin'?

Cause we allustrious, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust, if you fuck with us
It's a must we bust, and if you stand with us
Nine times out of ten son you might get bucked
Cause we allustrious, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust, if you fuck with us
It's a must we bust, and if you stand with us
Nine times out of ten son you might get bucked
You might also like
Yo, the lost page of a wild rhyme writin' nigga
P holds the pen tightly, explode nightly
I count on one finger all y'all rap niggas that excite me
Y'all niggas is trash rap - wanna fight me?
You shook to death, take breaths and step lightly
Y'all Little League niggas is so bald they might be
Spent too much time with wifey, come out to play
With the hard-headed, Infamous song torture
Crack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight
Pull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights
My spiral book, hold the world's most lethal
There's no cure, for what my pen do neither
Bring the fever, y'all niggas is the rap jesters
While we was gone for a moment, y'all kept the crowd goin' now
Move over bacon, time for some'in meatier
Your shit's weak, your best song was mediocre
Fuck a penis, how dare you entertain the thought
That you could come out to challenge me in blood talk?
Take a walk jerk, this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill
This is rap for real, somethin' you feel
You catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo
It's heavy metal for the black people, rock'n'roll
But it's hip-hop though, my drug music
It's thereapeutic to the user, you slam dance to it
Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes 'til death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
It's a must we burst ours first
Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes 'til death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
And it's a must we burst ours first, nigga

Yo.. crack the Henny bottle while I drop this jewel on your dome
My shit'll touch home, straight to the core you ain't alone
Play the unknown type dunn, mysterious stars
Concealin them slugs, if it go down, remember that mug
Cause ain't no love when a nigga shit is touchin' his ribs
Hungrier than a hostage, shit, we blitz
In formation pack the lead up in shit
The better you get, the better we get, and that's it
Yo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom
Stop 'em in they tracks, goin at 'em when you send 'em
Imperial dogs, creepin' through fog
Carved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal
We roll Mobb D-iezel, the whole Q.U. double-E, N-S
And when you spot us, play low-key
Dunn these niggas is actresses
And they tryin' to play the man's role
Can't they see us wildin' out on the video?
Don't they see us in the club swingin' elbows?
Or on the street with our jewels on the cell phone?
Hoppin' the sidewalk with Benzes and Jeeps
I ran through more cars than it's sand on the beach
I'm pleased to meet you, now here's a word to the smart
Don't ever let your peoples boost up your heart
Cause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart
Challengin' the Mobb in the arts
Our literature stands colossal, compared to y'alls
Way ahead of your time, you're strugglin' to keep up
Your style's limited, your rap's primitive
Go 'head with that bullshit you kicked dunn

Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes 'til death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
It's a must we burst ours first
Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes 'til death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
And it's a must we burst ours first, nigga
Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes 'til death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
It's a must we burst ours first
Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashesEmbed
