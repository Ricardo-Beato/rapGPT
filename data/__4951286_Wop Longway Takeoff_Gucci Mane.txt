10 ContributorsWop Longway Takeoff Lyrics
Honorable C.N.O.T.E
Yeah
It's Gucci (Droptop Wizzop, Bobby Kritical)
Huh (Deuce)
1-0-1-7, yeah (1-0-1-7)

They said money make me arrogant, I said it make me show off (Money)
Back when my dough was low, man, it make me kick your door off
Not really a rapper, man, this shit just is a throw off (No)
Pistol whipped him so bad that his ear damn near tore off (Huh?)

Bring my pot, yeah, cook that shit in your house (Your house)
Stash house in the suburb, it ain't even got no couch (Huh?)
I ain't bring no condom 'cause I'm only gon' fuck your mouth
Gucci Mane, I'm so South
Penthouse from the poorhouse (6)
Colder than an ice house, paid killers at my house (Burr)
I got mega millions, still ain't got more cash than my spouse (Shh)
Yeah, my bitch a brick house (Yeah)
Yeah, I ran a brick house (Ah)
Arthur Blank, I run Atlanta, I might take a Vick out
She so thick, I dropped the racks, then I pulled my dick out
Extendo with the dick out and she like how it stick out (Mwah)
She asked 'bout the wifi and Gucci brought a brick out
Heard them niggas hatin', so we gon' bring them sticks out (Wop)

448, this the 'bow house
Used to be the pour house, young nigga throwed off
Stick hit your top like Adolf
Gotta keep your wifi, hit 'em with the hotspot
Cook a 36 in a crockpot
7.62 make his shirt tie-dye
And I keep the spinach, no Popeye
That's your main bitch? Nah, she a thot thot
Red dot on your head, that's a hotspot
We gon' start stepping 'til we Fox 5
Pull up on 'em with the stick and make 'em pop out
Made a hundred thou' cash when I dropped out
Dropped a ticket, made the NBA lock out
Sendin' spinach 'bout our business, all Popeye
Fox 5, leave you like caca
Don't bring it off the stove 'til the fire hot

They said money make me arrogant, I said it make me show off
Back when my dough was low, man, it make me kick your door off
Not really a rapper, man, this shit just is a throw off
Not really a rapper, man, this shit just is a throw off1Embed
