Not nice, or the meanest
Feelin' sorry for my mama 'nem
Survivor's guilt really get old
Whole gang in the end zone
Not nice, or the meanest
Heaven's Gate when I get home
Color palettes lookin' Pantone
'Bout to turn into a phantom
Cameras off, get to flippin' lights
She ain't happy with the other guy
Had an argument the other night
I ain't even get to 'pologize
While I'm in the meetings lookin' disguised
I'ma show face 'til I get tired
Don't carе about event size
Lookin' at you through a fishеye
I'm never nice, or the meanest
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, yeah

We here, you can't deny that we here, we here (Woo)
Hands up, V's up for my man (Migo)
For Abloh, rest in peace to my man (Uh, hey)
I see your feet prints in the sand (Uh, woo)
We did everything that we planned
You might also like
Huncho, I did it big, you did it, kid, you did it, kid (We did it)
Like a ***** just got potty trained
Hourglass, how her body came (Yeah)
Chop 'em down, with the what-it-name (Grrah)
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm tellin you
Pushin' P, Bill Bellamy (P)
***** ridin' with a felony
See the jealousy
The struggle made me a better me (Struggle)
Why you talkin', is you payin' me?
Lamborghini coated candy (Skrrt)
If I **** her, she gon' have the baby
I'm the plan A, and the plan B (Hey)
Quarter million to the nannies (Go)
I'm the head of the family (Hey)
My momma had to cry for this
My gang had to slide for this (Slide)
Pistol Pete had to die for this (Die)
Doin' time through the wire for this (Hey)
Fresh out the bricks to a brick (Brick)
We steppin' outside with the shit (Outside)
Hannah Montana with grits (Hannah)
That honey bun gon' make 'em blitz (Grah)
I'm up, I'm rich, look at my *****, she fine and rich (Look)
Studied the game and I find the glitch
Hustler, I got a mind like Mitch (Hey)
He not poppin', he kind of lit
He not wealthy, he kind of rich (Kind of)
***** ain't trippin', just signed the—
Hunnid mill', we'll split (Split it)
If it's fifty mill', we'll split
If it's two in one, they'll split (Split)
Three ******* split a G6
These platinum plaques ain't nothin'
I stand over 'em take a ****
I stand over and take a **** (Hey)
This a hunnid thousand on the wrist (Hunnid)
Get the money, never politic
Floor seats, Atlanta versus the Knicks
Young nigga with the birds, Kyle Pitts (Brr)

Kid gon' play with 'em, he got friends
He know Migo them, knock off limbs
Yeah, we did it, kid, to the M's
Ridin' Presidential with the rims (Skrrt)
Helpin' Ye find *** in the black double M Benz (Maybach)
No new friends, Nobu with my twins (Nobu)
Remember we kicked that door down because they didn't let us in (Woo)
Born to win, I committed a sin with a see-through lens (See-through)
I filled up all my pockets, now you get a pocket to pick
Thank God I'm alive and rich (Alive)
No lie, I survived the trench
Pay my tithe, livin' marvelous (Tithes)
That's the reason I don't talk of this (Hey)
Hand-built it like a carpenter did it
Shootin' bullets out the cars for this (Grrah)
Tattoos and the scars for this (Tats)
'Member when we used to borrow fits (Hey)
Ladies and gentlemen
Feast your eyes on the winner's dance
But this is a different
Holy ground when I'm on the 'Gram
They hate me it give me adrenaline
The demons is makin' me sin again
I need to change how I'm livin' it
Take too much money to get rid of 'em
We did it, kid, we did it
I love when she playin' submissive
I need to finish my mission
I need my kids to be Christian
All of my hits to be hittin'
All of my people, they listen
Who gon' go make us a difference?
You know I fit the description
And my man had to die for this
Somebody got to die for this
Whole city finna ride for this
Say your prayer, we need God for this
And we still livin' marvelous
Pray for people in the war for this
And they make a new law for this
'Fore we ever get caught for this
We got everything that we want
I'm with Elon Musk, eatin' lunch
I bought a new crib at the space station
I can park my rocket in the front
And that money comin' in a bunch
I done had to fill it in a hunch
I'ma win whenever I say when
I got too much power on my tongue
I got horse power in the trunk
We too tough, they too punk
Thought I was comin' and I ain't do none
I was just scaring niggas, that was fun
Takin' the war since I was young
I go to war, just me and my gun
I'm with it all when we in the crunch
A real king, go stand in the front
Ladies and gentlemen
We'll be superheroes when we finish this
Pray for the innocent
The Ukraine and its citizens
Look at the shoes that I'm sittin' in
Ain't nobody out winnin' him
They say it's written
Well, it's written then
This one is different13Embed
