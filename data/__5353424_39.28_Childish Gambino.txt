Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all?
Two shots and a body, two shots and a body
Two shots and a body involved

Where are those subtle men?
With the decency to might be wrong
Where are those winter girls?
Who corrected, say women
I'm sorry, forgiven
Why would we ever change?
Planets never see a day that isn't towards the Sun
Bliss is a cheap emotion, everyone here seems to afford
So I don't know why I'm here without you, you

Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all?
When you're not invited, you take what you're given
Some wait every day for the call

Grief is a standing ocean, I never swam unless you did
So I don't know why I'm here without you
I miss you
You might also like
Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all? (You)
I call to a spirit, you may never hear it
How else could I keep you alive? Alive

'Cause it's hard for me to love myself without you here
'Cause the days are slow, but the years are fast
I wonder when I'll feel your smile5Embed
