52 ContributorsLong Time Part 2 Lyrics

I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don't think I felt your hand on my head yelling, "Call his father"?
But people don't hear ghost, so how they gon' play me?
Money saved me, so I'ma do the same thing
You droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift?
You better not miss this, overdose dope and mix this
Let your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it

Long time now since I seen you smile
Long time, long time now since I seen you smile
And it's been a long time, long time now
Since I seen you smile

Dropping tapes 'til I lost the count
Coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling, I'm Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowds
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib, I'm falling down
I'm on the floor, crawling 'round
I'm calling out to God, "You're little angel's falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around"
You might also like
Long time, long time now, since I seen your smile
We miss you

10 day
It's been a really, really long time, long time
Since a goof-ass nigga done tried me
Label niggas wanna sign me
And lame ol' nigga wanna buy me
Food and weed and drink and shit
Just as long as you inkin' shit
Sometimes I can't pay for food
'Cause sometimes I can't think of shit
Where's your head at? Where's your head at?
Singing my shit like you just said that
Wanging my shit like, "Where'd you hear that?"
Young-ass nigga, where you headed? Long time to get famous
Life's whatever you make it, just thank God that we made it19Embed
