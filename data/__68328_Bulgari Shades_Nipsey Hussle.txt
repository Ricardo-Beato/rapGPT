7 ContributorsBulgari Shades Lyrics
Look, I'm like, "Ooh, girl, what's your name?"
I got this cash
I know a place that we can go and trick off on someone of ten Bulgari Shades

I've been goin' hard so long without takin' no breaks
Feels so right, I booked two flights, we leave tonight, and get away
It's not about no chase, 'cause for your pussy I won't pay
But I'm inspired and refreshed by somethin' beautiful with brains
We both have broken hearts so it's alright to love again
'Cause when you let go of your pride, you'll find a lesson in your pain

Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down
Put your guard down, put your guard down
And that's when the-and that's when the guitar come in

Put your guard down
You got to, you know?
Or you can't be mad if youll never feel that feeling again!

Look, I'm like, "Ooh, girl, what's your name?"
I got this cash
I know a place that we can go and trick off on someone of ten Bulgari Shades
You might also like
That's Harrods in London
Like twenty racks, you know?
Foolish hoes, uh-huh
And I got like sixty buck too
That's 'cause the marathon continues, nigga
Get the breathin' right
Yuh

That made her smile but she said, "Boy, don't even play
I got two jobs, I go to school, I got responsibilities
But I kinda like that type of fly shit that you say
So if you give me yo number, I might call you up one day
And by the way, I know that game you play
With all your money and your fame
But to me it don't mean a thing
So, just take a seat, don't introduce me to Nipsey
'Cause what good is the hood if its no engine underneath?"

And that kinda fucked me up, it did
That's true
So I took a seat, took off all my jewelry
Put my blunt out, took my hat off
And took two shots of that coconut CÃ®roc
And bring some of that pineapple juiceEmbed
