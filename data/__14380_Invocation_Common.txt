27 ContributorsInvocation Lyrics

Envisioning the hereafter, listening to Steve Wonder
On a quest for love like the "Proceed" drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and chief weed from her
It's a cold world and niggas need summer
At times, my going forward seems like retreat
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and Jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seeming contagious
Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip-hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit I can't honor
It ain't that you selling, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform live-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could've sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key twenty
Young blood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land
I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him
When it rained, it fucked with him
This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming
I said it's hereYou might also like10Embed
