4 ContributorsTalk to God LyricsWith no shame and with confidence you're by my side
I proclaim it not in confidence, your truth and I
Can't stay quiet 'bout it
No, you know I tried, and I
I can't hold my piece, I see the world
Through Zion's eyes, sing Kim
Kids with babies and the chosen ones are dying slow
And oh, without you Lord I don't know where the world would go
All the brokeness is weighing down, hey, round we go
And I'm now hoping this is taking long
But here we are Lord
I'm walking the way (walking the way)
I'm feeling the truth
You're the life I believe
I believe in you (oh yes I do)
You're my hope every day
We're dependent on you (and you know you)
What a price, what a name
With no shame and complete confidence
Your word is true
I've decided to commit my life and follow you
All the doctors tell us news and things we all go through
All i know is what your word told me and I will do

All of the valleys, desert, storms and trials
