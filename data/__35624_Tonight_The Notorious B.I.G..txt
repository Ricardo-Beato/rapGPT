14 ContributorsTonight Lyrics
(Yo, check this out, yeah motherfuckers)
(Come on motherfuckers, B.I.G. motherfuckers)
Too much smoke in here man
Open a fucking window
What the fuck man
Yo yo yo yo yo

I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your Dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now, cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average player hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice, they see me in the streets
They be like, "Yo he nice, but that's on the low though"
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort-'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range, nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
'Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz; thinking 'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back--take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya; I ain't mad at 'cha
Blood rushin', concussions ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out fronting, smoking something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TV's a system
Knocking Mase shit; face it, we hard to hit
Guard your shit, 'fore I stick you for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, long kiss
You might also like
Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night, that's right, that's right
This might be the night (Kiss your ass goodbye)

Niggas playing they hands wrong, that's why they won't last long
Finessed what I was dealt with from the day I was born
While you bent up on that corner, niggas plotting and scheming
Up in them little holes, be creeping with Mac demons
Niggas know not to fuck with my dough
Niggas know not to fuck with this little bro, I'm 10 seconds hit'n'go
Black mask, black truck, chrome rims, Chuk' Timbs
Enough to confuse any witness
Strongest of calibers, is what we only travel with
You gotta get hit, your man dead, so you got a hand in it
Extort y'all, once friends, now we gotta cross y'all
You know the niggas with the biggest balls set the new laws
And flip fours, have 'em washing drawers while you up North
Gat to your jugular, getting your salad tossed
Overhearing niggas situations, singing like Lou Rawls
Sitting on the stand with no remorse

Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night, that's right, that's right
This might be the night (Kiss your ass goodbye)
Yo, yo, how we do niggas, I don't beef, I shoot niggas
If I can't get the main character, a few niggas then
I don't need no gin to boost me
I got enough steam to blow, somebody gotta go
I got fire in my heart, guns in my car
Cash in my Carhartts, it ain't hard to get 'em
Like blaow when I hit 'em, the nigga shit his drawers
When the 40-pound hit him, the fuck these niggas thought?
Could it be the fame, maybe it's the 2 Benz or
Would it be the same if I couldn't claim those?
Fuckin' put holes through your Range Rove'
Cocksucker, beat it, while you bleedin' on the dashboard
Niggas get, what they hand call for, I'm gettin' rich
You get deaded, I get erections over revenge, kid
You get a quiet spot in the shade for a grave
I'll lay a nigga down and steam roll away...

Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night, that's right, that's right
This might be the night (Kiss your ass goodbye)
