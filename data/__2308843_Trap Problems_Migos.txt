14 ContributorsTrap Problems Lyrics
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
No, no, no, no

The way that I whip it, no Chef Boyardee, they wanna know the recipe
I pop a pint, and I pop me a eight, now I'm movin' slower than a centipede
Twenty bitches runnin' round the lobby, suckin', fuckin' just to say they did it
I done fucked so many bitches, saw many ass and titties, it's ridiculous
Get on my knees and I pray at night, forgive me for my sins know I do the wrong and rights
Situation feel right when I'm wrong, but a nigga feel wrong when I'm right
Gianni Versace cover my eyesight
Kid Cudi nigga trappin' day and night
I be in the water with the sharks and they bite
These real diamonds nigga, Rihanna, cut off the lights

All my niggas from the slums, only girl I love is my momma
All my niggas from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
If we ever have a problem, my niggas pull up with choppers

I'm the one they talkin' bout with the spot with the pots in there (Pots in there, pots in there)
Walkin' round the city with a nine in my pants and a knot in â€˜em (Knot in 'em, knot in 'em)
Yo bitch she suckin' on me and she tryna get all of my (All of my Benjamins!)
Switcharoo your bitch, we flippin' that ho like a spatula
For real my nigga don't run up on me cause you niggas don't know me
Niggas that know me don't show me cause they know I got it on me
Feel like The Rock I'm giving out people elbows to all you Jabronis
You talkin' hundreds, we say chonies
Your niggas loaners my owners
Macaroni cottage cheese, 20 bandz in my Balmain jeans
No limit Master P, bout it bout it on the scene
When I take a piss, I see codeine
Hotboxin' backwoods in the lambo, can't breathe
If I smoke then it's expensive weed, I give you the sack if you find the seed

All my niggas from the slums, only girl that I love is my momma
All my niggas from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
If we ever have a problem, my niggas pull up with choppers
Came up from the bottom, now a nigga having power
Used to trap and slang powder, new Rolly ice on my hours
I got the bird like a owl, I'm in New York smokin' on sour
Look at you niggas is cowards, the bricks is surrounded like flower
I got her sangin' just like Mya, suckin' and fuckin' until she get tired
Feeling like Donald Trump, bitch you is fired
All my niggas blowing up like a fuckin' tire
Late nights in the bando feel like The Wire
My niggas heard that you snitchin, where is your wire?
And it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer
Said it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer!

All my niggas from the slums, only girl that I love is my momma
All my niggas from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
If we ever have a problem, my niggas pull up with choppers
Came up from the bottom, now a nigga having power
Used to trap and slang powder, new Rolly ice on my hours
I got the bird like a owl, I'm in New York smokin' on sour5Embed
