13 ContributorsRolly Up Lyrics
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up

Since my money fat I’m throwin stacks
Patron shots I’m throwin back
We look good, I’mma spend some racks
Turn round back and a brick squad tat
Taz brought it back but it still don’t pass
Push that Jag with a bag of cash
All this stash, and I hope it lasts
And I’ve never seen the bitch, suck dick so fast
I ain’t even know you was rich like that
How the hell a nigga pull a bitch like that?
How the hell a nigga got a watch like that?
How a nigga face to face with some shit like that?
Better have a mil, we’ve been like that
Tell the hoes how the goose is like that
Whole clique, rock ‘n’ roll looks like that
Got chick like this, so we flex like that
I’m serious, nigga, they’re curious nigga
These thugs have a bitch delirious nigga
Don’t see it, nigga, can’t hear them niggas
Don’t stand there, and don’t feel them nigga
I’m the trill nigga since a lil nigga
Only difference got it bigger, nigga
She a eye catcher let the car catch her
But it’s chainless so let the watch go
You might also like
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up

A dope boy watch is a Rolex
Every dope boy dream to have a Rolex
Everybody in the hood want a Rolex
You better keep your pistol with your Rolex
Ride, smoking, counting in that Rolls Royce
I brought the streets back, it needed my voice
Took the nigga for a check and bought a white Porsche
Bought a gold Rollie just to match the dope
You want a Yacht Master, know your mathematics
Hold your rollie up if you a real trapper
I’m not a real rapper, I’ve got a real check
Real street nigga with a Rolex

Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
There’s a plan, masterpiece, no AP
64 Gs told 'em, "freeze me"
My diamonds kick it, Jet Li
I’m balling hard, no referee
Brought Presi watches for the homies
Crime pay, fuck police
Came a long way from that Benny
Getting topped off of my Bentley!
It’s a Daytona, no Hublot
Got a pink slip, no car note
I’m balling hard, fucking up a check
Real street nigga, I ain’t gotta flex
I can count a mil, don’t break a sweat
That iced out Rollie got her pussy wet
Got your little brother throwing up the set
Got your lil sister throwing up the set
Waka Flocka Flame!

Drunker than a motherfucker screaming Rolex gang
If you own a Rollie, getting money, do your thang
You a broke nigga, kill yourself – Kurt Cobain
Squad!

Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it upEmbed
