8 ContributorsEverything Lyrics
You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women weren't mine
So you stuck by my side
So everything

Everything you want and need
I'll comfort you, give you all of me
Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be

It'll be you and me
For eternity
I give you my love everyday
I'ma be yours either way

You and your niece, me and Jacquees
We can make love in between them sheets
All you can eat on me, it's a feast
Have fun wit' me while I run these streets
So sweet, so rough, so tough, so bad
Get whatchu want, throw it in the bag
Stayed down wit' me even when I did wrong
That's probably why I'm singin' this song
A boss hit, a boss lady, that's you
Put your face on my right arm, tattoo
Met you, gotchu, get you
You're my angel, god bless you
Who am I in love with? Just you
Float on the boat, just us two
Smokin' and strokin', just us two
This is splendid, flex it and bend it
Lay it out for ya
Now let me play it out for ya
You get what she won't 'cause she don't compare
You get what you want 'cause you have been there for me
Carefully, prepared to lay down your life for me
My life would be nothin' wit' outchu
And I ain't doin' nothin' wit' outchu
You might also like
You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women weren't mine
So you stuck by my side
So everything

Everything you want and need
I'll comfort you, give you all of me
'Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be

It'll be you and me (that's all it will be)
For eternity (yeah)
I give you my love everyday
I'ma be yours either way (either way)

He was gettin' money outta town (O.T.)
I was in the city 'bout mine (you know how I do)
And I knew he was a dog, had to put him on pause
But it happened at the right time (it worked out)
And I know you got drip, fast whips and the mansions
But you really need a girl who understands you (for real)
Like when you cash out, know I can too
Yeah I run through the money, I ain't ran through
And I keep it a hunnid
Good head, down bitch, let him get in my stomach (uh-huh)
First lady, still married to money
It was like a blind date 'cause I ain't see it comin'
Damn, I was on deep, he was still playin'
We was both young till I turned him into a man
Bitches do it for the 'Gram but this really who I am
If you get up in a jam, I'ma come through with the bands
Yeah, my type, no stereo (my nigga)
I love you like that woman that carried you
Back and forth, no merry-go, die for you like burials
I ain't speakin' it up, just givin' you a scenario (just playin')
Yeah, I'm goin' to war if it's 'bout you (all day)
It ain't for me then it's not true (no it ain't)
I wanna be the last one you gotta lie to
I got everything I need if I gotchu
You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women weren't mine
So you stuck by my side
So everything

Everything you want and need (everything)
I'll comfort you, give you all of me (all of me)
Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be

It'll be you and me
For eternity
I give you my love everyday
I'ma be yours either wayEmbed
