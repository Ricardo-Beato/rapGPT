43 ContributorsOutside Lyrics
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We outside, outside (Hey, hey, hey)

I wake up, throw on some clothes and out the door, I won't be back, ma
Shinin' sun, horizon settin' up a lovely backdrop
My life the topic of a lullaby
Ah, breath of fresh air is somethin' right
I don't wanna be inside today
Just keep it rollin' like we ridin' skates
I got a halfy of haze, I'm thinkin' we gon' get high today
And let the sun shine all in my face
Oh yeah, this life is good, don't let it all go to waste
Just walk outside the door to get your mom off your case, haha
Yeah, free livin', swear I be on some hippie shit
But gettin' way fresher than the hippies is
I got the, the gift of gab, somethin' that you wish you had
Don't need to get a strap, nah, I'd rather kick a rap
Enjoy the place that you livin' at, stay 'round
We just some kids and this world is our playground

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We outside, outside (Hey)
You might also like
When I be on some kid shit, go and take my shorty on a picnic
And every day feelin' like it's Christmas
The kinda weather have the people livin' so privileged
I know the Lord take, today He was tryna giveth
Hey, hey, ayy, rich or poor, a sunny day a sunny day
We start the madness as soon as we hit the month of May
Rain, rain, go away
Waitin' for my homie Mr. Sun to come our way
Little kids runnin' through the streets playin'
Poppy on the porch, he ain't got time to waste it
He just an old man in the sea, Ernest Hemingway
Elevate, look up in the sky, stare at Heaven's face
Second grade, holdin' down the corner, slangin' lemonade
Every day hustlin', you ridin' down Penny Lane
You ain't gonna get a day like this
So put to rest your troubles with that goodnight kiss

Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We outside, outside
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
'Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shinin' and I'm feelin' right
We outside, outside6Embed
