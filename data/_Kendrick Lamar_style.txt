This is a public service announcement
We call it Blood Sport
I had to do one too, I sorry
I'm a competitor
Oh my God, it's about to get hideous
I hope you niggas know your history

Homie go ask Doc (talk about me)
Homie go ask Nas (and he'll tell ya)
Homie go ask Jay (young fella)
But when you ask them all (don't be jealous)
I'm the best in LA. In LA
Or wherever the fuck that you stay

It's all copastetic
Hip-hop no longer face Armageddon
Call me Bruce Willis
No call me lieutenant tinted windows on the black benz
So they only see it late nights like Jay Leno
I fuck twice your girlfriend probly told you we can't fuck
No, she lying
Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
You abusing the game you defiant
Disobedient student need attention
Have parent conference I'll be there, Just let me know what classroom you in my son
I am Dwyane Wade of recording
You more like Kobe Bryant with no endorsements
That's like Shaq at the freethrow, pointless
I'm equivalent to a Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues
I suppose I handle the rock well
I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll
The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench
Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics
My team something like the retro Celtics
Which means consecutive championships
Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent
To the way I do a verse he handle the ball
The same way I handle it with no pen
I call Jay Rock when I wanna dish it off
He bang like Vince Carter when he first saw NBA Court
Alley oop the court let him do what he want
Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports
How bout football?
I run the game like Walter Payton back 1984
I'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning
Play the field like Ray Buchanan
When I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary
Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry
Hip-hop cops on me, I dodge 'em like Barry
Sanders
John Madden hold your commentary
Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion
Should I keep going?
Aw fuck it let me keep going
I'mma do it like the '97 T Owens
Not the ‘07 T Owens
T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin
Y'all need to work on y'all defense
I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend
Maneuver like Warrick Dunn
I'm just having a little fun have some with me
Let's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey
One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza
MVP of LA, call the doctor
I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something
It’s about time for halftime reporting
I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand
You ain’t nice till you play all positions
Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend
I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in
You might say, "ouch"
Just let me score one time
Dribble my balls to the floor one time
I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan
I am the Jeff Gordon of recording
I am Tony Hawk if I was skateboarding
I am Michael Irv before the coke snortin'
Aw fuck it I’m what’s ever important
After this you gon applaud him
If not, fuck it, I’m blood-sportin'
Homie, I’m blood sport

They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?
(Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em)
Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Screaming, "Fuck the world" with a capital F
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop

Now you got a body
But what I love most is how you put
Put your lips on top of me
You gots to be the baddest bitch I've ever seen in my life
Wait!
Your girl look better than you
You know what that means, I'm done with you
Bye!

Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm
Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm
Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and they're looking at the charm
I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back
And the heat lay right, right, right under that
Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat
That's the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, I'm a stand up guy
I'mma pump my fist, I'mma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy
Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money
With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me
Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
100 carat, nigga I'm the golden child
Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial
Wow, I'm amazed by how you niggas talk about you're married to the game, ain't took a vow
I'll fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up
Now, I'm on some other shit, we ain't on the same page
You ain't sticking to the script
Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
Shoot up your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat
Blood or crip, I don't give a fuck bout none of that
All of y'all can get it, homeboy, it's more than rap
Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap
I rap like I got angels on my back
God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit
I don't write it
Off the top like a psychic
I kick, lyrics like Jet Li
Which produce money to put your boy on the beach
Shit, sand in my feet
Tell me what the fuck you know bout me

You boo-boo!

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off

He say, she say...

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep
'Cause everytime y'all come around
Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
Keep it running, Ali
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

So tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"

You turnt down, you weak
You weak, yo’ bitch weak
Yo- (laughs)
You boo-boo, you T (laughs)
Keep all that

What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
You don’t have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion76Embed
I welcome y'all to boot camp
Training Day
Fasten your seatbelts

Who shot ya, I don't know but you're best to call a doctor
Make sure them rookie medical surgeons can oper-rate on you
Pistol whip break the face on you, shit I does it my way like Sinatra
Let them infrared's Dalmatian dot ya
Scope'll spot ya, move wrong and I got ya
Through my vision like perennial
Creepin' to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as I tippy-toe
The tip I owe is through your window pane, I'm insane
One shot could leave 'em senseless, Marlon Wayans
Psychiatrist can't restrain the mind of a sick patient
Spray everything, not a single bullet wasted
Be patient, you gon' be meeting mad links
Put 'em in the basement
BET, I'm strapped with TNT
Follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh
That's what they say when they see me in your coupe
Sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop
You tried to play big and say "gimmie the loot"
Tables turned, now the people saying "please don't shoot"
Get out the way, lady, and try to make it to safety
Cause I doubt that my shit is on safety
Spray niggas, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
Ride shotgun, 745 Maybe
That's Maybach for you dumb motherfuckers
I'm wise like my pops but I'm young, motherfucker
I'm the one, motherfucker, bust around hustlers
You want it? They could serve you, butler
Excuse me Ma, I ain't going for your lover
So when I fuck you, the same time I'm like "fuck you"
You're better off looking for your next sucker
Money talks, I thought you heard Chris Tucker
I ball as if I play for the Rucker
Black Widow, keep something under my pillow to buck ya
He talk about it and when the fifth touch ya, no confession, no Usher, for real
Your whole spot is a movie like Blockbuster
If I want you imma bring it to your block, busta
And make it clap, no I'm not spliff star and busta
In fact, my niggas is linemen the way they rush ya
I keep it street from Compton to Russia
Rhyme technique is something like none other
It's warfare, choke if you scared, go buy a flashlight and pray under your covers
I slaughter niggas, one hand bang, Vince Carter niggas
Young boy I'm a father figure to kids who's minds is bigger
And they pops still sprung off the hardest liquor, I'm young
Please move in orderly fashion
For the love of money and crime I got a passion
Blow your body and spine whenever I'm blastin'
Makeover your whole face, you look like a Jackson
Any one, pick one

It's K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Who say West Coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop?
I'm 'bout to give you a prime example

Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?
Where my nickels and dimes at?
.45's Mac 10's and nines at?
9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat
If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
You wanna die? I can help you
Put the rap beef aside and  the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised
I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime
Mike Jordan in his heyday
Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines
I'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred
Uncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas
Grandpa moved to Mississippi
I really can't tell if dude missed me
Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe
More reason why my heart cold
Prior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio
We tryna do songs, but they ain't listen
They just kick down the door as if they have permission
Why you had to do that for?
I wish Pro Tools was on record
Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something
No assumptions, I know I'm nice
I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass
Not Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan
Chokin' the mic, releasing my frustration
Rather do that before I catch court cases
Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin'
Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
K. Dot's in my colon
That nigga, Colon Powell
Modern day war victim
Oh, I'm foul, come join my coalition
No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
Feel relentless, new apprentice
King of, comprehension
No competition
Compton's back, pump your fist like this and that
No sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts
You're a disgrace to this rap business
Just a one-man office, you need assistance
Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors
I am a senseless thug, with book smarts
And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question
We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession
Gave you the rhyme scheme before your English education
Exclamation, put it in quotes
I say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag
The flow, the artist development
Am I who gave you the growth?
You didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed
The sun shine, and now king me
The rapper's rapper, the MC's MC

Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga, oh)
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
And we don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right, but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

That’s what it said to me
But the place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I’m off track like Dale Earnhardt
My liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio, I wanna tell him, nah

That’s what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you

Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer33Embed
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
I'm inspired, so get inspired

And so he said "Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
And when niggas holla, "What's up?" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me?
Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you" (Sometimes)

We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

And so she said "Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, "Hi, Daddy"?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even though you get violent and put your hands on me?"
Sometimes
We hurt people that love us, love people that
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love90Embed

I got all the juice, you something like a Poomby
I'm soon to be the greatest for the ages of the young
Watch the game like a raven, cravin' rappers 'til I'm numb
Novacane can't contain the pain that I brung
Bitch, I shine like a microscope bouncin' off the sun
Words bouncin' off my tongue like a damn trampoline
Hoes manicure, hemmin' up the bottom of my jeans so I kick him off
Got haters pissed off, used to have no bank
Look at my account, you see O's like Rick Ross
I drift off to the moon, martian
Use the Big Dipper as a teaspoon
Parkin' my UFO somewhere that you don't know
Welcome to the C4, you see one, you see four
Bombs in my peak hold, bombs over Baghdad
Son you niggas, you can never say I was a bad dad
Run you nigga like a marathon
This is when Vietnam meets the Babylon
Bring it to yo front porch, tanks on your grass lines
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, jumpin' from the foul line
In order to see the king, you gotta swim through the ponds

I'm still lost in my own zone in the living room
Like I'm dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
Patron shots I consume taking the pain away
Each sip bring me closer to my doom
Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind
Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time
It's passing away, the world decides, it ain't what it used to be
Everything I love don't mean what it used to mean
For example spitting a 16
No thrills, feeling numb like i'm of Thorazine
It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing
Now I'm just trying to trap cream
Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow
What you can do today, that's my new motto
With that said, I roll out the bed
Hit the showers, it's time to get this bread, now make dollars

I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
Cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
So me without one is like I'm dated
I'd be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored
I'm one of the best of my Homo Sapiens
One of the best of God's creations
He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
I know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, I can feel you hating
Serving mc's like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
Half of these niggas ain't half of me
Half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain
Ten years in my career, pray to God that I don't blow up my brains Lord, I'm here
Great Depression, I don't know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost so much
(?) Usher
Either way i'm caught up in materialistic
Anything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it
Getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
No matter the crime rate I still remain content
Moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
Then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence

With my voice on the beat, I'm the voice of the streets
From my head to the feet, I'm bad to the bone
Nigga, I won't stop, 'till I'm add to the throne
Dog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit
Call me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse

Trapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island
I was a drug dealer, but now I'm a wild spitter
Nigga, I'm more iller, call me a hospital
You got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga
I spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga
Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch

I'm the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us
See them in the streets, these niggas don't be saying nothing
But keep on talking, you ain't ready for beef
Jay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets
I can't help it, the hood flow through my blood
This gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug
Everybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas
Wrong place, wrong time, that's how you get clapped nigga
Raised in the projects, money my object
They standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them
You'll get shot walking through my section
Now you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school
Everyday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing
Shit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class up in the Gardens
Money over bitches, nigga i'm heartless
Money over bitch niggas, rich is my target

We're far from good, not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top down, screamin', "We don't give a fuck"
Drink my forty-ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
'Cause the kids just ain't alright

Oh shit, nigga
Somethin' 'bout to happen
Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty keys under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it

Welcome to vigilante, '80s, so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you gettin' fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travelin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula, draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips, and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the '90s
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me

Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga

Until one day, he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right?
When he pled the Fifth, man, it was on, matter fact, she gone
Matter fact, Tyrone was on speed dial, so when she got home
It was going down, she go

I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?

I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumpin' "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yellin' at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough, don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give it all to her daddy, but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothin' really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she makin' ends meet

Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs, he'd compromise

She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where

And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve-bunk on tour
She suddenly realize she'll never escape the allure
Of a Black man, white man needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner's redemption, that sounds foolish
And you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fuckin' reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street

The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar

I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressin', my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours, sendin' me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right, just so you

Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I like to start it out from the bottom and build with you
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with you
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it and don't call me lyrical
'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet?
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard," probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me gettin' what I deserve
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He probably be out of work, laid back, while he

Doing my thing 'cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
From the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
Church is definitely on the move and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gon' expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?

I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: "Fuck niggas"
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive1.3KEmbed
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6th

Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping?
If what I write down don't collect this very moment
Then I'm on it, no question
In the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet
This is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo
Track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
"I thought you had a show?" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting
Two-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck hip-hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover Dam, water, sherm
Contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
You'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing
But lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga, "Front me, let me put it on the strip"
Then give it back when I think about the consequence
Shit...

R.O.T.C—Right On Time Conscience10Embed
See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here

I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards
Stomping on em' like a Kappa
Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
So where do I go now
Swear there is no-nothing after
I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC
And you don't want to get caught in the rapture
I would probably burn your whole colony
Chew you up then spit you out
You nothing but a Polla Seed
Follow hood policies
Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be
You never seen a killer til' you seen one on side of me
That green on the side of me
Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like a sodomy
Fuck them bitches properly
I do it
I do it, done it, run it like I grown legs by the hundreds
My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
Bummy, NEVER
Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bomb on whoever
Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
I steered right through your fan base every time
Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways

He got it on lock like a Low Jack
Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where y'all came from
Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker
Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
On sight motherfucker, sight motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
When I go pop, pop
Open up, close shop like a retail spot
Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
Bitch that's no lie, let the truth be told

Sit still, and close your eyes (Smoke to it)

Just searching for the perfect shot

When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

I used to write rhymes, all day and all night
While you were playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscious only knew whats half tight
At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
This is a dog's fight, my nigga
The soundtrack to life, my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
That's because that's these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers
The good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome

Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for

Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently, all I seen was Spam and raw sardines

Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims

Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with

Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly

Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork

And the world don't respect you

And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one

Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me

What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin

And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi
Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
Bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
See, loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year

I learned in trappin', in the business
Smart people makin' horrible decisions, you know?
Rich nigga, gettin' my dick sucked after the show
I ain't gon' lie, we were poor
A bunch of lost souls in survival mode
It wasn't no way for us unless we found our own
Runnin' in stores, kickin' in doors, nigga, give me my glory
Nigga play with me, he ain't gon' live to tell the story
You know, this the type of shit we glorify, everybody gang-gang
Most of the people that you grew up with are now in the chain gang
In the box, gettin' pink
Niggas shittin' where you sleep
Niggas shittin' whеre you eat
Who'da evеr knew that I'd become a fuckin' Kodak? Yeah
Rap money good, but I'm still pumpin' gas through the hood
Droppin' off plates to the fam' like Thanksgivin'
Got the baby snipers standin' on that murk business, yeah, slidin' for Yak
They ready for whatever
I always knew that everything would get better
And it sho' got greater later
All the game came from the elders like hand-me-downs
Me and my brothers wearin' hand-me-downs
Now I'm givin' game back to the old heads
And the respect come first, yeah, you know?
Can't be better than the OGs, you gotta get it somewhere
Gotta come from somethin', God don't come from nothin'
We ain't seen this comin', nigga, it's more than a blessin'
What you doing with Kendrick? (Ooh, ooh)
What you doing with a legend? (Ooh, ooh)
So what they call you? (Ooh, ooh)
When it's all said and done, we ain't leavin' empty-handed (Ooh, ooh)
That's on gang (Ooh, ooh)
That's on Ma' Dukes (Ooh, ooh)

If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let's say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you

You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in them county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shootin' niggas, blood on the highway
Crossеs on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take evеrything that I ask for
Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showin' a pattern for certain
I think it's white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did forty-three shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way
Put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love
Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped off the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love
Catch us, you know I'm gon' rack up
I need the advance and the equity to match up
The engineer dead if the drive don't back up
These words come of God, you could never outrap us
Nowadays, gotta walk cautious, ayy
Nowadays, I'm a new prophet, ayy
Game dead, no autopsy, ayy
City girl with they new hobby, ayy
Catch a body, put the Prada in the ta-da
Nigga 'bout to get some pussy, give me five (Give me five)
Gun dirty, got the thirty in the purse, purse
Tight bitch, put a perky in her salad
I gotta pray for the basic
I never seen my niggas bust down faces
Them niggas not tasteless
I only had one chance, I ain't even waste it
Been down on my luck
Been down on my luck when I fa-a-all
I gotta get up
I gotta get back up and ba-a-a-all
R.I.P., under my people
I'm proud of my people, I'm proud of my dawgs
My ex got a beamer, she want me to see it
I still ain't gon' see it, like, okay
I love when they ratchet, I don't do her Patek
I still do the watches the old way
She think I'm conceited, I'm thinkin' 'bout cheatin'
I don't do the flowers or roleplay
Now, how can I fold lookin' at twenty million
This money don't come with a probate
Mama, I said it'd be okay

Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

Sherane (Girls wanna play-play-play)
Where is she takin' me? (I got)
Where is she takin' me? (Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in...)

All I—all I—all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
"They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off"
"That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'"
"We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' ru—they run opposite way
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that"
"And I hope that bitch that set him up, out there
We gon' pop that bitch too"
"Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody"
*Car door opens and gunshots are fired*
"Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?"
"L****, you good?"
"Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!"
