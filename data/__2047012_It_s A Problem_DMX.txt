6 ContributorsItâ€™s A Problem LyricsThe niggas got it
You should solve them
Fuck the bullshit nigga
That dog is a problem
Problem, problem
That bitch movie
I just made that
I show that
I'm a keep that
Fake tricky ass nigga
Fake tricky ass nigga
The bitches wanna rehearse
Yeah that means damn
That means damn
What the fuck nigga?
I'm out here
Get out in the dark
Anytime you fuckin' bitches
Think how it's done
You see don't hate the hood
Check it
I make moves niggas wish they could
Come through with my dick out
And diss they hood
Like "this they hood?"
Cats walk around like "I hope they don't"
I wish they would
Knowin' they won't
What that do?
What that do?
And we gonna go just either way
Problems just worry you last
I beat the shit out of money
Cause it's just all I do
It's all I do
Nigga you got it?
If it's a problem
Solve them
The bullshit nigga is a problem
I beat the shit out of money
Cause it's just all I do
It's all I do
Nigga you got it?
If it's a problem
Solve them
The bullshit nigga is a problem
I'm the type of nigga that you slip blades
The hood loves a nigga like good haze
This is what the hood makes
You'll survive if you're lucky
Trust me
You don't want to see me flipping out
Now fuck that
It's time to whip them out
Walk through with me now
And fly with me later
A lot of violent guys screaming
Fuck the haters
Hard on the beat streets
Sleep with the ladies
I'm poppin' pills, snapping fingers
Breaking necks
Now show me some respect
And cut the fucking shit
Yeah I'm back bitches
Niggas know that bitches
The real in this game
When I come to the right bitches
You can call cash if he or she has it
When it's coming to heat
He has it
This bitch is sick as the beat
When I reach out
They'll be sicker than me
And I can't do shit
Caus ei ain't the same tough
I got fake
But so is the surface
You can't toss the way you handle the game
I beat the shit out of money
Cause it's just all I do
It's all I do
Nigga you got it?
If it's a problem
Solve them
The bullshit nigga is a problem
I beat the shit out of money
Cause it's just all I do
It's all I do
Nigga you got it?
If it's a problem
Solve them
The bullshit nigga is a problemYou might also likeEmbed
