She’s hotter than a skillet
She came to the spinner
She starting hitting splinits

Sheesh! Baby, let's get it
Drayed up and I’m drayed out

Favorite color been red
Turn Thugger to my bousin

Oh, I let go my ego

Doggie, thug her

We’re with it
Get it up!
She’s a horse rider
Put her in my mouth!
She’s a voice rider
We’re kicking!
No sleeping, aroused
Got it!
Pimping, smoking on tree
California 11, ...
Beat them! Shish!
Get out my face
She raping me with no hands, no trace!
I stand up in her
I’mma chop her by the hitter
She nodding, yeah
Lead the spot
