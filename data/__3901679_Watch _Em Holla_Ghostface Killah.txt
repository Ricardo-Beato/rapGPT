11 ContributorsWatch ’Em Holla Lyrics
I've been a lot of places
The very best of everything
Ayo, let these niggas know how I pop off, B
I've been a lot of places
Word up, man
Then take my card, my nigga (Yeah)
The very best of everything
Say yo

He was a serpent, too many foul moves was made
No love amongst the wicked, gotta get his head severed
I caught him in Miami, I was heavily armed
Blew a OZ of that blue dream, I'm ready and calm
Fiendin' just to do him dirty, already got the plan mapped out
Snatched him up and headed back to the hideout
Welcome, here's some exercise torture
This is everyday work, ice gold grillz with no smirks
Seen him frontin' with some skeezers
Actin' like he's a boss with no rank, pussy posin' as a leader
Had a bitch with me from the Island
A true man-eater slash diva, dark skinned Geneva
I sent her over, told her 'persuade 'em, walked him outside
Tossed him in the truck and then we slide
Got to the house, tied him up, plastic on the carpet
Tub full of piranhas, I threw him in and watched him holla

Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail) (Yeah)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods spit the real) (Yo)

Cause hell on your receptionist, foreigner's pharmacist
You're all in my face, who wanna put a scar in it
Scarface, big tour bus with the bar in it
Jets with the escalator, steps with your moms in it
Electric stove, she holdin' my gold medal
Hairy chest, don't mistake me for Burt Reynolds
This is baller alert, confetti fallin'
I look taller with works, spit bars that stayed lodged in the earth
Keep my gun cryin', I don't mean Clark’s
When I say, yo, there's “so many dyin'”
Starks, second to last nigga on "Triumph"
Rob me, I'm comin' with bands, no lyin'
Step outside with that Michael aura
Me and my team jumpin' off yachts in Bora Bora
Hennessey Privilège, Tito's, goose water
Motion picture, screens crack when they record us

It's the same old bullshit, y'all respect ignorance
Niggas, I'll split ya fucking head with the quickness
Show and prove intelligence, back about my business
As far back as I can remember, it's been gangsta
Old Earth had to hustle hard to make it better
Kept a nickel plated .32 behind the dresser
Showed me where she kept it in case of any pressure
Friends all fresher, tired of havin' lesser
Workin' wasn't working, forty hours overtime, pockets still hurtin'
Big decision makin', knew a few Jamaicans
Brung me in, showed me how to win
Camoflage blend, watch for the shark fin
 I was at the  cypher circlin' the serpent
10% sellin' you a dream, fiends coming to cop
I won't stop 'til it's got, getting there
I won't stop 'til this cop getting it
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods spit the real)

When I see that guppy, I'ma give him the business
We all know he be talking to the witness
Smell the foulness, he a traitor and all that
He all out of a space, put him in his place
I can't give him the raise, I can see the Devil in his face
I'm in the hood comin' down the fire escape
A lot of cats can't see me, I'm the great ape
Machine gun in my hand, headed down the fire escape
Yo, Rae, if they dilate give, 'em a seda-date
'Cause tomorrow, I'ma be movin' to Cali
Gold teeth nigga, bring back Ballys
I'm out here pumpin' these motherfuckin' raps
Yo, Eighty, show these niggas what we do to the wax
Hip-hop, nigga, don't make me come out of my Starter hat
Blow all these fake niggas off the face of the map
And then I'ma hit cyclical up, call it the cartel
Doing hot shit, goin' through hell
Police popped my homie, now it's time to rebel
Real niggas, no matter what, don't tell
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods spit the real)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods bail)
Never the same (Your hood, the Gods spit the real)2Embed
