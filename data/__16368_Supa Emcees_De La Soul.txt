(Slick Rick sample from MC Ricky D and Doug E. Fresh's "La-Di-Da-Di")
Hey, whatever happened to the (emcees)
Times done changed for the (emcees)
Every woman and man wanna (emcee)
But for what, I tell you (emcee)-ing ain't for you!
Hey, whatever happened to the (emcees)
Times done changed for the (emcees)
Every woman and man wanna (emcee)
But for what, I tell you (emcee)-ing ain't for you!

Man I'm on the set like the flicks so let your cameras flash
A splash bigger than whales, I'm makin monsters mash
Spit Pinocchio's Theory when shit be looking weary
I need rest, but I boogie for now, I'm on some mess
Like the best mics respond to me
Living days, like dreams of specializing in the art that pays
I be a mystic for life, so check my ID number
Emcees be needing dough while I make bread like Wonder
Yes, that's what you heard, so save that acting for the screen
See you can can that madness with the beans
I bust emcees like lies surprise em out the box
Put away the soda pops Iâ€™d rather rum on the rocks
A dime-getter tried to get what I got, for what?
I guess other folks' cash makes the lovin' come phat
But I'm past all of that, it's time to break with the breeze
Get to your knees, here comes the Supa Emcees
You might also like
Hey, whatever happened to the (emcees)
Times done changed for the (emcees)
Every woman and man wanna (emcee)
But for what, I tell you (emcee)-ing ain't for you!
Hey, whatever happened to the (emcees)
Times done changed for the (emcees)
Every woman and man wanna (emcee)
But for what, I tell you (emcee)-ing ain't for you!

Within this program of rap, I'll eradicate the glitches
Yo I'm dark like Wesley, but I be sparkin more bitches
Entering my constellation puts your lives in jep'
While you others represent, I present my rep
Cause when it comes to making dents, I'm that main imprint
Even smoked from blunts which give eyes the reddish tint
Could not prevent, YOU from seeing I'm the light
But bring attention to my words like some ass in tights
I heard you want to fight me, with your words on stage
So Mase pulls that instrumental from the jam YOU made
And as he starts cutting what you sold, I'll talk all over your tones
As if my name was Pete Rock or Sean "Puffy" Combs
Send your tattered ass home, with celly phones I roam
With my fleet, here to make this rap game complete
While you live fables, unstable, acting very radical
Projecting like you're hard, when in fact you're quite vaginal
Hey, whatever happened to the (emcees)
Times done changed for the (emcees)
Every woman and man wanna (emcee)
But for what, I tell you (emcee)-ing ain't for you!
Hey, whatever happened to the (emcees)
Times done changed for the (emcees)
Every woman and man wanna (emcee)
But for what, I tell you (emcee)-ing ain't for you!1Embed
