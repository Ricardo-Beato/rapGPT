What good is a bomb? (yeah, uh)
What good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb? (uh)
What good is a bomb?
Disater strikes as the story takes place
Fraudulent light society cast as rich
Thou might mitch
Gotta getcha an index finger
The threat is real now
Who'se pointing the finger?
Why must we testify?
Why must we die?
Why must they decieve?
Why must they lie?
Spread the theives out run the WHO
World Help Organization anti-n* proof
Check points
Loose the noose
Voilent protests, best we stage proof
Deserve finer things living interchangable
I recognize retaliation from every angle
What good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb?
Politicians on some big brother shit
The government kills only gives back sixty six
The terrorists
Why must they intensify?
Why must we die?
Why must they desieve?
Why must they lie?
Independence is the pool
Who'se the hit man behind the locked doors
My parents acts go untouched
Civil liberties they done away 'em
Hey protesters, light the fuse
Life or death, now which one would you choose
Come on
What good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb?

You know what they say?
They say you got the freedom of speech
That don't necessarily mean
You have the freedom to speak
Maybe you didn't hear me
They say you got the freedom of speech
That don't necessarily mean
You have the freedom to speak
Why must we testify?
Why must we die?
Why must they decieve?
Why must they die?
What good is a bomb?
What good is bomb?
What good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb?

What good is a bomb?
Come on, what good is a bomb?
Yeah, what good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb?

Yeah, what good is a bomb?
What good is a bomb?
