15 ContributorsUndeniable Lyrics
What it is, what you want?
Live your life right
Make the beat the bump
It's like one for the treble
Two for the bass
Three for the pretty babies up in the place
The undeniable

Come to the party in a B-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the world wanna dance
Fly like a dove that come from up above
I'm rockin on the mic and you can call me Mos love
Little homie you can call it what you want
But you can't call it weak and you can't call it chump
And looking like that, babe you need to call me up
Seven eighteen D-a-n-t-e, one what?
These jokers don't want none
And all the pretty mommies want some, tell 'em come
BK do it how Biggie say "Spread love"
R. Harrison, throw it on get 'em up
Dispirit and raw till they can't get enough
Haters get it twisted, real niggas get it done
Buck down like a live round not a dum dum
Bop bop
And you know, you know (make 'em say)
You might also like
(No matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now)
Yea, the undeniable
(There ain't no future in fronting
So just love me now)
Yea, the undeniable

So I start a flow
Just want y'all to know
Just who your listening to
Black Dante
So listen let me tell ya
Who I am, and how I do
The undeniable

Respect a foundation that they can't hold
And it's bullet, shatter, and earthquake proof
See how I drop the jewel, it's the golden rule
A-B-C, Always be cool
They need to teach it at every school
It's the A-B-Y Always be you
Def, and I always been true
Real, true, skill, true Ill
Ghetto world I know exactly how it feels
Some go work, and some go steal
Children grow, women produce
And we rock on no matter what you do
(No matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now)
Yea, the undeniable
(There ain't no future in fronting
So just love me now)
Yea, the undeniable

Yea, the undeniable, spread love y'all
6x spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
13x spread love, 
Every day, Brooklyn way, can't deny, no
Matter how hard you try
Can't deny, can't deny, can't deny
Spread love you can give us a one

Uh, What it is, what you want
Get your mind right
It's the beat to bump
It's like one for the treble, two for the bass
Make no mistake, you are rockin with
Black Dante
The undeniable
Ha, Yea, The undeniable

Raw, dynamic, and real
You got the feel
