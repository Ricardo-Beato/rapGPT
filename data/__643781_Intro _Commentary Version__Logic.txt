11 ContributorsIntro (Commentary Version) Lyrics
This song first came along when uh.. When 6ix, me and 6ix were in the studio, uh, at No I.D.'s spot and.. uh he just did the sample, y'know? He had it.. and I loved it and I couldn't identify it at first. I felt like I knew what it was, but I could not exactly identify it, uh.. and it ended up being this song that um.. No I.D. had sampled for Kanye West's "Bound". And I think it's so incredible how you can sample, y'know.. you give something to ten different producers or rappers and you'll get ten different things and, and, we got something different with this one and for this.. song I wanted it to be extremely musical and beautiful and.. y'know.. it's a very very raw hip-hop album, but.. I wanted to kinda mess people up when they first heard it, um and yeah. So it's just kinda talking about the state of hip-hop and not just hip-hop but music as well and where I see myself and kind of where I fit in to it.. um.. before really beginning to tell my story on the next recordYou might also likeEmbed
