10 ContributorsOff The Wall Lyrics
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance come on
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance come on
Now do it
Queen Bee, Bad Boy, baby
Uh, uh, uh
Let's go

Ah! Ready or not, here I come
I'm a Bentley y'all something like a Hyundai (whoa)
Wear more skins than Crocodile Dundee
Tasty like a sundae (Take that!)
(Mmm-da-da) Eat it like a Kit-Kat
Record your climax, replay back
Lil' Kim records hit the streets
DJs wanna spin that back like
Me and Lil' Cease is the real tag-team
While most of y'all broads is just drag queens
It's gonna take years before you match our cream (That's right)
And only in your dreams can you see what we see

Now lend me your ear, listen closely
I wear these jewels like a rosary
This is how the rap game is supposed to be
One king, one queen things supposed to be
You might also like
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on, now do it
Niggas lean left
Bitches lean right
Come on, you gotta ride 'em, baby
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do-do
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do-do
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do

It's the years 2G, things about to change
Trade in that Range, get a motherfuckin' plane
Your girl is lame, huh what?
Want a bitch like me what, huh?
If it's diamonds you want, baby, I got 'em
Money in a briefcase, who needs a wallet?
Be a pigeon, nigga, you sound retarded
I'm the girl with more green than St. Patrick's Day
A house by the bay so what do you say?
Me and you, nigga like running Roulette
The game is strip poker, is you ready to play?
Make it last all night and I'm ready to stay
Put your money and your jewels up one at time
And if you lose this game all this shit is mine
What you got? Full house, triple ace and two kings
Royal flush beats ten jack, here give me
I win give it up
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance come on
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance come on
Now do it
Niggas lean left
Bitches lean right
Come on, you gotta ride 'em, baby
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do-do
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do-do
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do

When it comes to sex call me Dr. Ruth
I ain't a prostitute I just speak the truth
Dicks I like 'em fat like a pickle
Hard like nickel, juicy like a Popsicle
Niggas mention me for a sexual reference
Lil Kim's everybody's sexual preference
A bitch like me gives it on the first date
Why hesitate? I ain't got time to wait!
Cause uh y'all know how I get down
(How you get down?)
Niggas from the East know how I get down
(That's right!)
Cats from the West know how I get down
(West Side!)
From the North to South say can you get down!
Now lend me your ear, listen closely
I wear these jewels like a rosary
This is how the rap game is supposed to be
One king, one queen things supposed to be

Now get your back up off the wall
Dance come on
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance come on
Now do it
Niggas lean left
Bitches lean right
Come on, you gotta ride 'em, baby
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do-do
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do-do
Mmm-da-da, mmm-do

Queen Bee, 2000
Get your backs up off the wall
Dance come on
Dance come on yeah
Dance come on
Notorious K.I.M

B.I.G. come on forever come on
(Just dance) Come on
