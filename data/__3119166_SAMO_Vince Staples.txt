Way up, way up
Way up, way up

Same old thang
Watch me do the same old thang
If I wrote your ass a love song, could I make it bang?
If I pull up with my gun drawn, run, I make it bang
Homie, tell me where you come from, tell me what you bang
Ain't a damn thing funny, but we laughin' to the bank
Never blow it on a chain, rather blow my fuckin' brain
Decorator came from Spain, blow the budget on an accent couch
What that accent 'bout? Southern California livin'
Daddy in and out of prison, ain't a father to my style
I'm the ODB of the OPB
When I go OT, all the shows sold out
And the hoes show out, tryna be a baby mama
Tryna break a player pockets, that's a no-no
This day forward, I ain't takin' photos
And we wear our own clothes, we ain't givin' promo no mo'

Just the same old thing (Way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing
Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (Way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old thing
Same thing (Way up, way up, way up, way up)
Same old thing
Same thing (Way up, way up, way up, way up)
Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing
You might also like
Win the race or fix your face, your woman on my dinner plate
I'm comin' for that last supper, center seat, I've been a G
I traffic 'cross the interstate
We cracked and launched the murder rate
They know who did the killin', but they didn't see
Want a verse? Issa price, want a show? Issa fee
We don't do no bargain shoppin', we don't show no empathy
Empty out your pockets, $10,000 fee for that talkin'
Eye contact is an extra five
No doubt in mind, we the best alive
No testifyin', we solid
Never told on my partners
My partner and them got bodies
I'm tryna put 'em in 'Raris
They used to put us in G rides, so now I put 'em in college
Put 'em on with this business then put 'em on with your mama

Just the same old thing (Way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing
Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (Way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old thing
Same thing (Way up, way up, way up, way up)
Same old thing
Same thing (Way up, way up, way up, way up)
Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
Way up, way up
Way up, way up5Embed
