Most of this shit smoke and mirrors

Don't believe what they tell you, Smoke and Mirrors
Half that shit they sell you, Smoke and Mirrors
You know you gotta hit, Smoke and Mirrors
You niggas can't be serious
Don't believe what they tell you, Smoke and Mirrors
Half that shit they sell you, Smoke and Mirrors
You know you gotta hit, Smoke and Mirrors
You niggas can't be serious

They gas you up like AMACO and fill your head with lies
Tell the team that got you here they ain't worthy for the ride
You need to cut em off immediately they not good for you
They tell you anything you wanna here but its up to you to know whats really going on thinks of what the fakest
Everything that glitters ain't gold have patience
They rather see you fall
They don't wanna see you ball
They gone try they damn best to come between in you all
Put the picture in the media bout the drama
Don't know heart or work it took from them summers
Now they wanna add you on Twitter like they your kin (What the fuck goin' on?)
Nigga I know you ain't my friend
You might also like
Don't believe what they tell you, Smoke and Mirrors
Half that shit they sell you, Smoke and Mirrors
You know you gotta hit, Smoke and Mirrors
You niggas can't be serious
Don't believe what they tell you, Smoke and Mirrors
Half that shit they sell you, Smoke and Mirrors
You know you gotta hit, Smoke and Mirrors
You niggas can't be serious

I camoflauge my jacket blendin' in with the snakes
I'm drinkin' on some Actavis and I swear I taste like grapes (Lean)
I got to be on drugs just to deal with the fake
This shit going on in the industry ain't no way am relate
You got to keep it real with the niggas that's around you
The ones that who was there before the fame, the ones that keep you grounded
You gotta show love to the hood in every county
Every City, every gutta a kissin' baby, hugging mothers
Them old folks they fuck with Future like they young again
Ain't no way Imma let you hold me back I'm going in
My top off go and kicks some rocks off nigga fucking with a young boss

Don't believe what they tell you, Smoke and Mirrors
Half that shit they sell you, Smoke and Mirrors
You know you gotta hit, Smoke and Mirrors
You niggas can't be serious
Don't believe what they tell you, Smoke and Mirrors
Half that shit they sell you, Smoke and Mirrors
You know you gotta hit, Smoke and Mirrors
You niggas can't be serious2Embed
