70 ContributorsWassup Lyrics
What's, what's, what's up?
Play that trumpet for the real niggas (What's up?)
What's up?
Play that trumpet for the real niggas
Yeah, let's do it (Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre)
Yeah, let's, let's do it

What's up? (Yeah)
What's up? (Woo)
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?

Uh, I'ma make sure they remember me
'Cause I walk around with lot of enemies (Woah)
I'ma make sure that they feelin' me
So I walk around with a new lemon squeeze (Woah)
Everybody know I am from outer space (Yeah)
So you know that aliens be sendin' me (Woah)
Yes, I walk around, pocket got bank account
If you wanna catch up, need like ten of me
You might also like
No, statistically, I can't win every time
But you know the score prolly like ten to three
And them three times that I had to take an L
I remember them boys tried to finish me
Said we roll a 'Wood, I roll like fifty L's
They say, "How you keep all of that energy?"
'Cause I can't go back to the hood where them niggas could send at me
I remember livin' right next to my enemy (Woah)
Now I got too much money, I could blow up your whole vicinity (Yeah, yeah)
Gettin' too much money, I can build me a new facility (Lil Uzi Vert, yeah, yeah)
I fuck her three times, so I call that girl, um, a trinity (Woah, woah)
Uh, and no time, I would never ever let 'em sentence me (Woah, at all)
And in no time, gotta duck off 'cause these niggas would love killin' me (Yeah)
What's up? (What's up?)
Don't deal with the lies and the frauds (No)
That's why I don't get involved

What's up? (Woo)
What's up? (Yeah)
What's up?
What's up? (Yeah)
What's up?
What's up? (Ayy)
What's up?
What's up?
Uh, I'ma make sure they remember me
'Cause I walk around with lot of enemies (Woah)
I'ma make sure that they feelin' me
So I walk around with a new lemon squeeze (Woah)
Everybody know I am from outer space
So you know that aliens be sendin' me (Yeah)
Yes, I walk around, pocket got bank account
If you wanna catch up, need like ten of me

Everybody know I come from outer space
I got racks on me, you do not wanna race
I got enemies so niggas gonna hate
Keep that semi on me, get you out my way
Hit a new mistress every day
Got the new bitch, get on the cake
Got that lemon squeeze for the trigger play
Got some red toes, she on the way
I got Koreans, F&Ns
Rose gold diamonds same color Hen'
Cops tryna arrest me, I'm gone in the wind
You cannot catch me or none of my friends
You know that Richard Mille cost me a Benz
You know we get it poppin' on my end
You see these blue face Benjamins
See the way these diamonds sittin' off the lens
You know we comin' in number one
You know we gon' kill the whole summer too
You know I'm blowin' up like an atomic bomb
You know it ain't nothin' to do
And I'm steppin', I'm steppin' in one-of-ones
Margielas got me walkin' on the moon
All this money got me like I'm on shrooms
Drankin' yellow, feelin' like a tycoon
What's up?
What's up? (Woo)
What's up? (Ayy)
What's up?
What's up? (Yeah)
What's up? (Yeah)
What's up?
What's up?

Uh, I'ma make sure they remember me
'Cause I walk around with lot of enemies (Woah)
I'ma make sure that they feelin' me
So I walk around with a new lemon squeeze (Woah)
Everybody know I am from outer space
So you know that aliens be sendin' me (Yeah)
Yes, I walk around, pocket got bank account
If you wanna catch up, need like ten of me16Embed
