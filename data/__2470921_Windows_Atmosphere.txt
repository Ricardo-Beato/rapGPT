5 ContributorsWindows Lyrics
Shut up, everybody shut up
I think you've had too much to speak
Give me the keys, plug the leak
Or go take a little step off something steep
I might be a fuck up
But I wanna do splendid things
I mean I want somebody to remember me
And maybe drive me around in a limousine
I'm just joking, I rather drive myself
Rather fly myself, most time, rather be all by myself
A party of one
And I'll keep going for as long as the arteries pump
Don't start no junk
I'm not a thug but I'm hardly a punk
And if it ain't the hard part of the month
Throw your hands in the sky, sing the harmony once

Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my car
I can see it all
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...
Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my house
I can see it all
(I like this) I don’t trust a motherfucker one bit though
You might also like
Shut up, everybody shut up
I brought my own knife and fork
Stood up to address the court
And said "The kid's so hungry, he'll eat the stork"
I might be a fuck up
But I'm in the upper percentile
I try to put a smile on my face
While the rest act so cold blooded like a reptile
Gotta look over both my shoulders
Don't even know ya, potential cobras
I'm tryna find a poser to design a poster to mobilize voters
This is not a top secret
But they already know what you're not thinkin'
Either you could submit or you could just stop speakin'
And find yourself inside another lost weekend

Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my car
I can see it all
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...
Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my house
I can see it all
(I like this) I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though
Shut up, everybody shut up
All of y'all talk too goddamn much
Slither back under that rock you're from
Got a hiss on the tongue that you just can't trust
I might be a fuck up
And maybe you are too, but I ain't no judge
Run through dirt just to kick up dust
Put a little paint on the tip of the brush
Go ahead breathe with no regrets
Life's too brief to be so upset
Gotta take the lost and plead the fifth
Sometimes the world will make you eat that shit
Gonna jump like a kangaroo, break outta the zoo
Let the universe know that you made it through
Stay true to your name and crew
But watch what you say and who you say it to

Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my car
I can see it all
I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...
Shut your pretty mouth, I got a window in my house
I can see it all
(I like this) I don't trust a motherfucker one bit though
I don’t trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...
I don’t trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...
I don’t trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...
I don’t trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...
I don’t trust a motherfucker one bit though, and it go...Embed
