Hold up, that my shit
Play it one mo ‘gain
Play it one mo 'gain
Hold up, that my shit
Play it one mo 'gain
Play it one mo 'gain

Remember back when it was hard for me to sleep
Mama played them old school jams on repeat
A little Sade sent me on my way
Dreamin' 'bout the shit that I'm doing today
Cleanin' up the house, Mary J on cassette
Smokin' on a J, sauce on the TV set
Runnin' home from school, Loose Ends on blast
Tyin' up loose ends, runnin' low on cash
Pops get gone a week, now she pagin' my Dad
Came in with some pizzas like nothin' had happened
Now we just laughin', jammin' to the oldies
Dеalin' with emotions, never hеard, "I'm sorry"

Play another song, let the music talk for us
Have us sheddin' tears so we talk through the chorus
Play another song, let the music talk for us
Have us sheddin' tears so we talk through the chorus

Hold up, that my shit (One mo 'gain, one mo 'gain)
Play it one mo 'gain, Play it one mo 'gain (One more gig where the mic at)
Hold up, that my shit (One mo 'gain, one mo 'gain)
Play it one mo 'gain, play it one mo 'gain (one more gig where the mic at)
Hold up, that my shit (One mo 'gain, one mo 'gain)
Play it one mo 'gain, play it one mo 'gain (One mo 'gain, yeah, I like that)
Hold up, that my shit (One mo ‘gain, one mo ‘gain)
Play it one mo 'gain, Play it one mo 'gain (One mo 'gain, yeah, I like that)

Playin' that Anita Baker early when I wake up
Smellin' scrambled eggs with the bacon
Knew this for the takin', 'fore I went to school
Mama played them classic tunes right on the station
Hidin' from the beat, the song never end
It don't ever matter 'til we play it again
In the minivan with granny, 'bout to do us some shoppin'
Johnny Kemp "Just Got Paid", got the whole car rockin'
That was back in the days, it weren't 'bout no clout
Niggas made music 'bout what they really 'bout
Heard this song my first time and it gave me goosebumps
Sayin' everything I felt, everything that I want

Play another song, let the music talk for us
Have us sheddin' tears 'fore we get through the chorus
Play another song, let the music talk for us
Have us sheddin' tears 'fore we get through the chorus
Hold up, that my shit
Play it one mo 'gain
Play it one mo 'gain
Hold up, that my shit
Play it one mo 'gain
Play it one mo 'gain
Hold up, that my shit
Play it one mo 'gain
Play it one mo 'gain
Hold up, that my shit
Play it one mo 'gain
Play it one mo 'gain
