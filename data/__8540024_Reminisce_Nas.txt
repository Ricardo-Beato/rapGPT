Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

My comfort give you discomfort
Just know that in the hood, they gon' bump this
And I'm only strong as my circle
The things that shaped me would've murked you

I didn't have to die so that they could call me the great one
Didn't take a couple albums, people said it from day one
From wings with hot sauce to tuna tartare, driven in RRs
From hidin' from robbery victims in back of cop cars
Tatted from my neck to abdomen
Almost gettin' shot was averagin' once every two weeks
Blessed what I had to been
These painful words, hearing these liars puttin' my name in dirt
Aim and I burst, pistol practice until my fingers hurt
I hit my target, uh, I up the margin
What they on? You know how Nas do, don't get me started
Chic, sleek and snazzy from a small family
Fine taste and I hate the unsatisfactory
We can gun blast or party, Great Gatsby theme
Bring your first ladies or come with your new nasty thing
'Cause every other day I'm remindin' myself
I reached every goal that was high on the shelf
You might also like
My comfort give you discomfort
Just know that in the hood, they gon' bump this
And I'm only strong as my circle
The things that shaped me would've murked you

(The things that shaped me)
And I don't like to reminisce
(The things that shaped me)
'Cause what we doin' right now is really lit
(The things that shaped me would've murked you)

When you high as me, you get highly critiqued
Hopped on a beat, purposefully soundin' like '9-3
None quite like me, so haters can S-M-D
When they bitter like black liquorice, my life still sweet
I went for the cash grab, crack cash was my math class
Fresh white tee, two diamond crosses look like a hashtag
News is fake, never knew I'd soon relate
To Tom Brady goin' for seven in Tampa Bay
It's that crazy, I ain't never been bothered, that bothered you
You ain't born for this shit, being great is too hard for you
That's a hater problem, they try to say it first what you might say about 'em
While you stuck in the past, I stay vibin'
Can't just reminisce only, gotta live in the moment
Talked my shit at the MOMA with The Weeknd performin'
I'm chosen, got off the big Boeing in Rick Owens
Rick owe us, peep how different it look on us
My comfort give you discomfort
Just know that in the hood, they gon' bump this
And I'm only strong as my circle
The things that shaped me would've murked you

(The things that shaped me)
The streets, the beef, the beats
(The things that shaped me)
The creeps, the thieves, defeat
The things that shaped me would've murked you

And I don't like to reminisce (Shout to Mary J. Blige, Y-O, QB)
'Cause what we doin' right now is really lit
Those things were great man but today what we doin' is next level
And I don't like to reminisce (That was then, this is now)
'Cause what we doin' right now is really lit (It's about right now)
The things that shaped me would've murked you

Trippin' on 'em, spinnin' corners
Distant times, I reminisce on 'em
Reminisce, and my past ain't the prettiest
There was a time they wasn't feelin' us
Mass Appeal, now we really up
Reminisce, relationships ain't the prettiest
I was stuck on the silliness, was it love that I was really in?
We don't know until it really end, but then it's too late, reminisce
