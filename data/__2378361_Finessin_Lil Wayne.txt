Yeah
It's Baby E. on the track
Yeah

Said
Trappin' getting old, so I been moving weight
Pigeons in the trunk, I'm on the Interstate
Made myself a plug, get it a hundred ways
And I still got the Act' you know I love the taste
Spending dirty money at the Gucci store
Fuckin' with the models, eating sushi rolls
She think I'm a rapper, get that groupie love
Baby mama mad, she see me movin' up
On to bigger better things
Bigger television screens
That I never get to see
'Cause I'm so heavy in the streets
I just blew a hundred thou'
So I'm goin' outta town
And I'ma try to make it back all right back

Finessin', finessin', I be finessin'
Finessin', yeah, finessin', I be finessin'
Finessin', yeah, finessin', I be finessin'
Finessin', finessin', finessin', I be finessin'

Ballin' in this bitch, I put my partners on
Tie you up and make you call your baby mama's phone
Tell that bitch to bring that bag, oh lord we need that bag
Xannies in a plastic bag, call that a sleeping bag
On MLK in a Bugatti, I feel free at last
Percocets, Molly, and Syrup, I got PMS
Chillin' with your bitch watchin' First 48
And I still got that Act', you know I love the taste
And I let her hit the J
And I let her call me bae
And I let her call you back
Just to get that out the way
Then she hang up in your face
And I get it on her face
Then I teach her how to skate
Then I skate
I'm straight

All my girl got is some heels and a lil towel on9Embed
