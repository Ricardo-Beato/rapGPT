25 ContributorsWalk on Water Lyrics
Ricky Racks
It's the return, East Atlanta, Santa!

Off the wall, off the chain
Off the top, I'm off the leash
So many freaks coming by the spot
Had to move, I broke the lease
I'm a dog, street gorilla
Going ape shit, I'm a beast
You feeling froggish, nigga jump
Got that pump on me, capiche?
I'm complete, can't compete
Pussy nigga check my physique
I'm a freak, made 3 albums in 6 months
I'm so unique, I'm elite
I'm prestigious, got two hoes in the Saint Regis
And all day all I dream about is sex
That's why I got on Yeezys
The Trap god but I love Jesus
Jesus, Jesus, Goodness gracious
All these sauce it's getting contagious
Done in Vegas stays in Vegas
Punchanella Punchanella
Put a brick down put it back together
Cash and dope go hand in hand
Hand you the yay, hand me the bags
It's Gucci!

I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
Neck like water
Wrists like water
Earrings, fingers and they look like water
Just bought a house and it's right by water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
Neck like water
Wrists like water
Earrings, fingers and they look like water
Just bought a house and it's right by water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water

G-Gucci Mane I'm the water man
Make it rain, do the water dance
Water dripping like the faucet drip
Hit ten hoes on my Florida trip
Like 21 Savage I slaughtered it
Thirty thousand dollars I ordered it
Like Dae Dae, I spend this shit
Like Lil Uzi Vert, I'm dripping it
You can walk on water too if have faith in me
I got high paid killers, you safe with me
Set me up on first date, don't wait on me
I'm a human highlight, First Take with me
If you got a Don, who needs a Wraith?
If you got a bank, who needs a safe?
Buy the restaurant, who needs a chef?
My game's too official, who needs a ref?
When the Wopter call, don't hold your breathe
I came to ball, until nothing left
Balenciaga sneakers, baby watch your step
All you rappers broke, but I came to help
I'm Ric Flair, I came to take your belt
East Atlanta Santa, you just an elf
When I do it, I do it, I do it to death
All these haters can go to Hell
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
Neck like water
Wrists like water
Earrings, fingers and they look like water
Just bought a house and it's right by water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
Neck like water
Wrists like water
Earrings, fingers and they look like water
Just bought a house and it's right by water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water5Embed
