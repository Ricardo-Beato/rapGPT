23 ContributorsWar Lyrics
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feeling alright
I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth as Hall & Oates
Briefcase, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', cocked? No
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creeping in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her
And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire, try and stop me

There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feeling uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo
'Cause she's standing on the corner of Linden Boulevard
Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight
You might also like
Yeah, nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's crying
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashing
Newcomer called Verbal Assassin running with
Nothing but the worst type, worst fight
When we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging
In my new car bought from entertainment
Champagne and gaining clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club hugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, "never disrespect me"
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the Land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezing the pen, released again, chart toppers
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world
Checking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy
I'm grown up and thankful for lessons God gave me

There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feeling alright
I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

From the day you was born...
Your daughter Destiny, was one of your destinations...6Embed
