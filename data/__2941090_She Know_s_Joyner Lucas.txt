19 ContributorsShe Knowâ€™s LyricsK-K-Kato on the track bitch

I got a girl, she dope as hell (Dope as hell)
She wear that Gucci, That Louis, Chanel
Shorty so right can't even deny (even deny)
Booty so fat you can see from the side (see from the side)
I'm just a guy, I'm just a man
Lotta things 'bout me she won't understand
I think I'm so used to being alone
Now I have urges to cheat on the low
No, It ain't cool
No, It ain't life
No, I ain't saying that shit is alright
But it was only supposed to be once
Now I got more than one chick on the side
Feel like a dick
Feel like a cheat
Wonder how'd I feel like if that was me
Knowing they fearing, I know that It's wrong
Ain't no excuse and I feel like a dog

Then my phone rang, my phone rang
Got me using code names, I'm so ashamed
Now my girl lookin' at me so strange, say I won't change
Oh na na
Now I'm layin' there with my lover and she starin' and me oh

And I think she knows
Yeah I think she knows
And I think she knows
I think that she know whats up
I think that she know enough
Yeah I think she knows

I'm para-I'm para-I'm paranoid
I must admit
Real mixed emotions that I gotta fix
When she at work I be losing my mind
Feeling like she know the truth and I'm blind
Taking my time, I got a plan (I got a plan)
Plus I'm afraid that she won't understand
If she found out then I'd be on my own
Fighting these urges to cheat on the low
No, it ain't real (No, it ain't)
No, it ain't cool
No, I ain't saying that this is the move (This is the move)
But it was only supposed to be once ('Posed to be once)
But that one night just turned into a few
I'm such a dick
Feel like a cheat
Wonder how'd I feel like if that was me (If that was me)
Knowing they fearing, I know that it's wrong
Ain't no excuse though I feel like a dog
Then my phone rang, my phone rang
Got me on some code names, I'm so ashamed
Now my girl lookin' at me so strange, say I won't change
Oh na na
Now I'm layin' there with my lover and she starin' and me oh

And I think she knows
Yeah I think she knows
And I think she knows
I think that she know whats up
I think that she know enough
Yeah I think she knows

Then my phone rang, my phone rang
Got me on some code names, I'm so ashamed
Now my girl lookin' at me so strange, say I won't change
Oh na na
Now I'm layin' there with my lover and she starin' and me oh

I've been so selfish, I've been so blind
I feel so stupid, I don't know why
I got a good girl at home
And I know she love me so much
And she know I'm up to no good, no good
And I think she knows
Yeah I think she knows
And I think she knows
I think that she know whats up
I think that she know enough
Yeah I think she knows1Embed
