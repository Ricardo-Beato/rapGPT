Say some' (Say some')
Lately, you've been like the bullets stuffed inside my gun (Gun)
The restaurant's about to close, conversation carries on (Carries on)
Analyzing your thoughts, tryna see what you're on (You're on)
Half drunk, fully high, you grab my wand (My wand)
Leave the past in the rear, it's time we overcome (Overcome)
Our energies align inside of your pond

We can live the dream life, wild, oh
Got me feeling like a teen again, yeah
It's feeling like it's teenaged love, hm
If you feel the same way, then say some'
Say some', say something, oh

I could make it worth your while if you say some' (Say some')
Say some'

I been tryin' hard not to make scenes
I just got so much passion for you
You been sending mixed signals to me
I've been steady movin' close to you
I get so upset I fell in love
I get so excited next to you
We should run away, forget the crowd
We should run away, just me and you
Think of all the things that we could do
You might also like
We can live the dream life, wild, oh
Got me feeling like a teen again, yeah (Ooh)
It's feeling like it's teenaged love
If you feel the same way, then say some' (Say some')
Say some', say something, oh
(If you feel the same way, then say some', say some')

I need your love, oh-oh (Love)
I need your love, oh-oh (Love)
I need your trust, woah-oh (Trust me)
I need you here
So, so, how you, h-how you scooped that?
I'll tell you, dawg, see
I told the bitch, "Baby, I'd lie for you, baby, 'cause I'd die for you, baby
Baby, I'd paint the sky for you, baby"
Just like that, brother
Word?
Just like that
I need to be on that
