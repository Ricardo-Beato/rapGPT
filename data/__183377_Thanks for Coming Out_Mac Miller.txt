17 ContributorsThanks for Coming Out Lyrics
Yo
You have now reached, the back of The High Life (Aha)
Thanks for comin' out (Comin' out)
I've been your host, Mac Miller (What?)
Been great spendin' the evenin' with you (What? What?)
Let’s ride out (Ride out) (Ayo, Jerm, make sure they feel this)
For one last time (Big)
East End Empire (What?)
DJ Chef (What's good? Light it up)
Let's get it

So lay back in your seat (What?), with your feet up on your couch (Uh-huh)
Thanks for comin' out (What?)
It's been good (Been good), it's been great (Been great)
See you later (Later)
Time's runnin' out (Out), and y'all know what I'm about
Thanks for comin' out
It's been good (It's been good), it’s been great (It's been great)
See you later (Aha)

Uh
So it's the end of the tape, the last page (Last page)
Hoes backstage, party like my last day (Last day)
Matter fact, bitch I ain't even half-way finished (Nah)
Y'all fragile, held up in your glass case (Bitch)
Your grind sleepy like that foreign dude runnin' the Rat Race (Haha)
Ass face, all your music nothin' but bad taste
I murder beats, you can ask Ma$e, homie
My shit I drop stinkier than trash day (Trash day)
I ain't gotta change shit, I'm so dangerous (Uh-huh)
And my style like a smile, so contagious
Bitches givin' me they hearts
So consistent, never smart
'Cause they always beggin' me not to break it (Break it)
And I'ma make it (Make it)
I’m somethin' you don’t really see often
Gonna be the greatest and that just ain't just the weed talkin' (Nah)
I tell these people, "Give me a clue"
'Cause the boy be chasin' honeys like Winnie-the-Pooh (Aha)

So lay back in your seat (What?), with your feet up on your couch (Okay)

Uh
Raindrops fallin' on my brain (Brain)
Stayin' on track like I'm followin' a train (Train)
And I'm grindin' like your teeth when you angry (Haha)
Go ahead, cry yourself to sleep, you a baby (Yep)
Just a bum, gotta hand you some change
Too smart, y'all can call me Andy Dufresne (Aha)
Still got a inbox full of textin'
Hoes tell me that I make a great first impression (What's up?)
Never stick around, so they never learn they lesson
Hit it, then I'm Nick Cage, gone in sixty seconds (Yep)
But you already know that, pimpin'
Fish outta water, need to go back swimmin'
They trippin', every time I'm rollin', they dippin'
'Cause my style "Doh!", call me Homer Simpson
In the sky like Santa, I'm fly (What?)
You a loser, Meg Griffin on Family Guy, aha (What? What? What?)
So lay back in your seat, with your feet up on your couch
Thanks for comin' out
It's been good, it's been great, see you later
Time's runnin' out, and y'all know what I'm about
Thanks for comin' out
It's been good, it's been great, see you later
