Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could just to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let them talk about it, mane, I'm already livin'
I risked my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, loungin' like it's a beach chair
Papa don't preach, a-all we do is just reach here
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doin' magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high, then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzin' by
The queen pin to the kingpin, redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins

Yuugh, this the life that we made
Gunshots in the dark like a sweet serenade

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could just to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let them talk about it, mane, I'm already livin'
I risked my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (Woo)
They love me on my Ric Flair shit (Woo)
In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (Woo)
Who are you to be compared with? (Woo)
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Court cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces

Yuugh, this the life that we made
Gunshots in the dark like a sweet serenade
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could just to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let them talk about it, mane, I'm already livin'
I risked my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it

Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me
The best rapper livin', I know who's alive to me
Yeah, the competition's all but died to me
Raah, I make these motherfuckers hide from me
The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
You just posin' for them pics so you can upload

Yuugh, this the life that we made
Gunshots in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga

Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could just to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winnin', no vision on quittin'
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let them talk about it, mane, I'm already livin'
I risked my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it135Embed
