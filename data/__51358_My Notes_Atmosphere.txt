18 ContributorsMy Notes LyricsAs long as I can hit my notes
I saw the sun rise, then the green grew
Weaving through the concrete cracks that we cling to
As long as I can hit my notes
I'mma try to keep up with my folks
I smelled rain and brought the flash flood
With a river of permanent tear drops and rap hugs
Bad luck played with the effortless
So I backed away from quick benefits
Shed skin of those that spit venomous
Yeah, that's him. He's the one that tips generous
Still tryin' to define my description
A life with a little spare time for livin'
But even if I wanna hold the position
I gotta go like, "Daddy don't know any different"
I saw the noon sky, look at the snow melt
I left most my baggage up in a hotel
As long as I can hit my notes
I'mma travel down that gravel road
I heard a bird cry; It was pathetic
Man, if you can fly spread feathers like a message
As long as I can hit my notes
I'mma stand on top this box a soap
I felt the track slip but didn't pull brakes
I'm half dead but already got a full plate
