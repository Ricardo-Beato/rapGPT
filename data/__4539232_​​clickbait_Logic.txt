You are amazing, you are amazing, you are amazing, you are
You are amazing, you are amazing, you are amazing, you are
You are incredible, you are incredible, you are incredible, you ain't shit
You are incredible, you are forgettable, you are forgettable, you are for...

All these comments got me lost in my mind
All these thoughts that I'm having are not mine
I always post that I'm having a good time
So my life looks perfect online
She say she never done some shit like this before
Suck my dick until I nut and then I go
I want a good girl but I always fuck with hoes
I love drugs, I pop pills, I do blow, blow, blow
I think this girl at the club wants to fuck me
And I really think her boyfriend wants to fuck me up
You're the reason that I'm up all night
You're the reason that I get no sleep
You say my music ain't shit when I creep
Say I should empty the whole bottle in my mouth like Peep
And overdose, immortalize myself
While the media use my death, monetize they wealth
RIP Lil Peep, let that young man sleep
Let that young man death teach
The youth, the streets
To beat addiction
Yeah, that's my diction
Moment of silence
I don't do the Breakfast Club 'cause Charlamagne is shameless
That's the only one I leave out when I run my bases
Do your research 'fore you call somebody homophobic
You make a living off of controversy and you know it
I ain't that type of artist, respect my name and we can talk about it
I'd suck a dick just to prove it ain't that way (Nigga, what?)
Ninety-nine percent don't listen what I say (You gay)
Quote that line but leave out all the mental health
Slap a bitch in the face then I count my wealth
That's the shit they want, yeah, that's the shit they need
That's the shit make people click
That's the shit that make me sick, so

You are amazing, you are amazing, you are amazing, you are
You are amazing, you are amazing, you are amazing, you are
You are incredible, you are incredible, you are incredible, you ain't shit
You are incredible, you are forgettable, you are forgettable, you are for...38Embed
