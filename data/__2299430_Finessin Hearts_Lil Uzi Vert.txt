Ayy, she left me lone, I ain't even know how to react
Text my phone every day but I won't hit her back
Tear it up from the back, pullin' out every track
Style mean, put me on Craig Green, yeah, that's a fact
She left me lone, I ain't even know how to react (No)
Text my phone every day but I won't hit her back
Tear it up from the back, pullin' out every track
Style mean, put me on Craig Green, yeah, that's a fact
Ayy, she left me lone, I ain't even know how to react
Text my phone every day but I won't hit her back
Tear it up from the back, pullin' out every track
Style mean, put me on Craig Green, yeah, that's a fact

Promethazine got me in a dream
Smokin' gas, lungs collapse
Xanny bars, take 'em by the threes
Man, you need to relax
All these drugs, feel like a junkie
It won't bring her back
And if I thought anybody really had my back
It'd be you, know you still my boo thing
Pull up in V, in that Mulsanne (Sportscar)
Kick game so retarded, it's a Liu Kang (Fire, fire)
Do anything for you 'cause I'm a fool, mane (Fool)
Ayy
You might also like
Pacing myself and I'm running the game just like Usain (Woo)
Yeah, no matter what, feel that shit in my gut, you're my boo thing (Woo, woo, Lil Uzi)
I might just pull up in Porsche and I drive like a boss swervin' two lanes (Yeah)
She said you is too lame, LUV Is Rage too flames, ayy

Ayy, she left me lone, I ain't even know how to react
Text my phone every day but I won't hit her back
Tear it up from the back, pullin' out every track
Style mean, put me on Craig Green, yeah, that's a fact
She left me lone, I ain't even know how to react (No)
Text my phone every day but I won't hit her back
Tear it up from the back, pullin' out every track
Style mean, put me on Craig Green, yeah, that's a fact
Ayy, she left me lone, I ain't even know how to react
Text my phone every day but I won't hit her back
Tear it up from the back, pullin' out every track
Style mean, put me on Craig Green, yeah, that's a fact

Pacing myself and I'm running the game just like Usain (Woo)
Yeah, no matter what, feel that shit in my gut, you're my boo thing (Woo, woo, Lil Uzi)
I might just pull up in Porsche and I drive like a boss swervin' two lanes (Yeah)
She said you is too lame, LUV Is Rage too flames, ayy
Pacing myself and I'm running the game just like Usain (Woo)
Yeah, no matter what, feel that shit in my gut, you're my boo thing (Woo, woo, Lil Uzi)
I might just pull up in Porsche and I drive like a boss swervin' two lanes (Yeah)
She said you is too lame, LUV Is Rage too flames, ayy
Gettin' that money, spent a lot of money my new chain, yeah
She left her hubby to get right with me, that's a food chain
Young nigga quick, stay on his shit and I won't turn into food, mane
Put on my necklace, look at them diamonds, water water jewels, mane
Gettin' this money, go to Bora Bora right with my crew, mane
Treatin' these girls like they is animals in a zoo, mane
Seventeen hundred a young nigga stuntin', I spend that on shoes, mane (One pair)
Burberry
Ghetto bitch got Burberry
(Ghetto bitch got Burberry)

Ayy, she left me lone, I ain't even know how to react (No)
Text my phone every day but I won't hit her back
Tear it up from the back, pullin' out every track
Style mean, put me on Craig Green, yeah, that's a fact
She left me lone, I ain't even know how to react (No)
Text my phone every day but I won't hit her back
Tear it up from the back, pullin' out every track
Style mean, put me on Craig Green, yeah, that's a fact
