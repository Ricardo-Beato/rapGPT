*Steps back*
Let's get it, Lil Uzi
Let's get it, yeah

Okay, I'm not with the funny shit
I need my money quick, if you don't got it, catch fold (Fold)
And if they come after me, turn to catastrophe
Hundred round drum, no reload (Reload)
And If I die 'fore I wake, I pray to lord for my soul to take, that's how it goes (Goes)
It's fucked up we not in the same position
You sell your soul just for some gold (Gold)
I'm not with the funny shit
I need my money quick, if you don't got it, catch fold (Fold)
And if they come after me, turn to catastrophe
Hundred round drum, no reload (Reload)
And If I die 'fore I wake, I pray to lord for my soul to take, that's how it goes (Goes)
It's fucked up we not in the same position
You sell your soul just for some gold (Straight up)

My body keep shakin', my head it keep turning, I been sittin' out in the fold
It's fucked niggas get a lil' money, they turning so cold (Cold)
The cops was just after me
Jack boy was after me, shit, I don't know where to go
That's why I got these gats on me, hundred round don't reload
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Lil Uzi
I don't even smoke (You know it)
Just roll me something
I don't even smoke (I don't)
About to roll me something, I am
I don't even smoke (Yeah), I don't even smoke (Yeah)
This money keep comin'
These threats do not phase me
I will get you touched for the low (The low)
I'm whippin' up baby, this shit is amazing, what I do on grandmamas stove (Stove)
I'm countin' big faces, these niggas be hatin'
My killers be totin' these poles (Poles)
And if you take picture of that lil' money
You will be the lick for the show (Show)
And when it rains nigga it pours (Pours)
And when it sleet nigga it snows (Snows)
This summer I'm stuntin', I'm hot as the oven
The sun hit my chain now it glows (Glows)
And when it rains nigga it pours (Pours)
And when it sleet nigga it snows (Snow)
This summer I'm stuntin', I'm hot as a oven
The sun hit my chain now it glows (Glow)
