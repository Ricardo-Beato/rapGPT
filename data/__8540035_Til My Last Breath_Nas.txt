It's like the military
You see soldiers marchin'
With orders to knock it out the park

And we all about this money (Yeah)
And it’s all about this money (Oh, yeah)
Yeah, you know we 'bout to run it
And you know we 'bout to run it

Yeah, yeah, I get it 'cross state lines (State lines)
King's Disease, going KD, going Trey 5 (Trey 5)
All net like I'm starting for the Nets (For the Nets)
Base to base, I might suit up for the Mets (For the Mets)
YG's, OG's, represent the 'jects (The 'jеcts)
I'm applying pressure, I see why she prеssed (Why she pressed)
When she with me she GloRilla, FNF (FNF)
N-A-S, I'm steppin' 'til my last breath (My last breath, yeah)

I'm bigger than algorithms if I'm being direct
Used to play McGruff, freestyles on cassette
Patties and cocoa bread, skunk trees from the dread
While the D's and the Feds watching
Before New York had Bloods, before L.A. had Suge
Before the South had Percy Miller or Thug
I was home reading a book, top speed, probably a blunt
A can of Sprite, and a chopped cheese, now it's hamachi
I ain't commercialized, how can they stop me
Got two fists up in the air, top of the steps like Rocky
Tired of picking up clothes, I got a personal shopper
Got a Grammy, got an Emmy, next a Tony or Oscar, yeah
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, I get it 'cross state lines (State lines)
King's Disease, going KD, going Trey 5 (Trey 5)
All net like I'm starting for the Nets (For the Nets)
Base to base, I might suit up for the Mets (For the Mets)
YG's, OG's, represent the 'jects (The 'jects)
I'm applying pressure, I see why she pressed (Why she pressed)
When she with me she for real, FNF (FNF)
N-A-S, I'm steppin' 'til my last breath (My last breath)

And we all about this shmoney
And it's all about this money (Yeah)
Yeah, you know we 'bout to run it
And you know we 'bout to run it

Ayo, I just landed, Richard on my right hand
Forty on my nightstand, hundred on my left pinky
Billion of y'all wanna be me, told shorty come and see me
Bring a friend, 'cause I'm greedy, bought her a bag, double CC
Political correctness, hecklers are more respected than the one giving the message on stage, it's messed up
We can't say anything without offending
So now my mouth is in the jailhouse with cases pending
First Amendment, you replaced it, rigged it
Dumbed it down is not an option
Some of it I understand, take the power from me, that's the bigger plan
Modify, try to stop it
I'ma ride, keep hittin' (Yeah), keep pitchin'
I'm colossal, can't stop my survival
Just landed, AP on my left wrist
Tell shorty come bless this, had a bad one in Texas
Unbothered, well rested, bad one at Essence
We brung it back to the essence
Got the verse done, 'bout to text Hit
Yeah, yeah, I get it 'cross state lines (State lines)
King's Disease, going KD, going Trey 5 (Trey 5)
All net like I'm starting for the Nets (For the Nets)
Base to base, I might suit up for the Mets (For the Mets)
YG's, OG's, represent the 'jects (The 'jects)
I'm applying pressure, I see why she pressed (Why she pressed)
When she with me she GloRilla, FNF (FNF)
N-A-S, I'm steppin' 'til my last breath (My last breath)

And we all about this shmoney
Yeah, you know we 'bout to run it (Yeah)
And you know we 'bout to run it
Run it up

Yeah, yeah
Hit-Boy, Esco
