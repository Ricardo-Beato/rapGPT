17 Contributors2 Diamonds Lyrics
Girl, you know...
Girl, you know I fuckin' love you
That’s on God, on his son too
But you be actin' like it's untrue
But you be actin’—cut!

Girl, you know I fuckin' love you
So why you actin' like it's just you?
Girl, you know we never rumble
But don't make me get someone to jump you
'Cause you be actin'
Actin' funny when your hair fixed
Actin’ funny, I ain’t laughin'
Get your pussy, not your ass kissed

Ooh, but my pool so big, got a yacht in it
And the yacht so big, got a pool on it
But the house empty when you not in it
When I look up at the ceilin’, see the roof fallin'
My world so big but it stop spinnin'
My tears so big, it's a tsunami
Her pussy so good, got me short winded
So bad to me, so good for me
Pool so big, got a yacht in it
Yacht so big, got a pool on it
This house is not a home when you not in it
Got a new bitch with me, shе just spot fillin’
World so big but it stop spinnin'
Tears so big it's a tsunami
Pussy so tight, I get locked in it
Lеave the lights on, we look like two diamonds, yeah
You might also like
But we don't even talk no more (No)
We run outta words to say
We don't even joke no more
We run outta games to play
We don't make love no more
And when we do, it's not the same way
It's not the same way

Girl, you know I fuckin' love you
On God, on his son too
You be actin' like it's untrue
You be actin', cut
Girl, you know I fuckin' love you
Why you actin' like it's just you?
Don't make me get someone to come through
Tie you up and make 'em fuck you, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Actin' funny when your hair fixed
Actin' funny, I ain't laugh, bitch
You, get your pussy, not your ass kissed, oh

Pool so big, got a yacht in it
Yacht so big, got a pool on it
House empty when you not in it
Look up at the ceilin', see the roof fallin'
My world so big but it stop spinnin'
Ask her what it is, she say, "You callin'"
Pussy so good, I get short winded
So bad to me, so good for me
Pool so big, got a yacht in it
Yacht so big, got a pool on it
House not a home when you're not in it
Got a new bitch with me, she just spot fillin'
World so big but it stop spinnin'
Tears so big like a tsunami
Sweet as moonshine, got the moon shinin'
Leave the lights on, we like two diamonds, yeah
