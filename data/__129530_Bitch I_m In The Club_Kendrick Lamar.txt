Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

Okay, what these niggas hollin' 'bout?
Catastrophic K-Dot, bet I bring them dollas out
Talk that shit, potty mouth, walk that shit, pep stroke
Guarantee yo girl, get sliced like Kimbo
Bitch, I'm in the club, homies blowin' indo
Turned up, throwin' up signs to the ceiling roof
Sipping on that hundred proof and I'm dressed in Gucci too
And these hoes jock a nigga so I holla, "What it do?"

Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single
You might also like
Move somethin', move, move somethin'
Got these stacks full of hundreds with an icon woman
On my left, my right, my right, my left, I'm throwed
Beyoncé's, two Halle's and three Keyshia Cole's
Wait a minute (Wait a minute), can I pop my tags? (Pop my tags)
Can I do the fool? (Do the fool) Can I swing my rag? (Swing my rag)
I'm a Hub City maniac, bitch, get it right
Bartender, hurry up, put them bottles on ice

Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

I got a hundred dollas on me (I'm rich, bitch)
Baby girl, I know you wanted (This dick)
All righty I might be in some loafers or Nikes
Faded blazer or white tee, either way she gon' like me
I get it crackin' for no reason at all
Lookin' you see that I ball like a pupil that's soft
And I can tell you don't have what I have
Which is a lot of juice, motherfuck swag
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

I got a hundred dollas on me (I'm rich, bitch)
Baby girl I know you wanted (This dick)
I got a hundred dollas on me (I'm rich, bitch)
Baby girl I know you wanted (This dick)9Embed
