23 ContributorsIn Love With the Gwop Lyrics
(Hoodrich, bitch)
Make a nigga get out of character
If you fuck with our motherfuckin' cash, nigga, you hear me?
Guap
Phew
We serious about that paper
Ayy, guap (DJ Scream, heavy in the streets)

Girl, you is my baby, girl, you is my baby
I gotta smoke some weed 'cause, girl, you drive me crazy
Man, I wish a nigga try to take it
Thirty shots all to his brain, yeah
'Cause I'm in love with the guap, I'm in love with the guap
I'm in love with the guap, I'm in love with the guap
I'm in love with you, guap, I'm in love with the guap
I'm in love with you, guap, I'm in love with the guap

I'm in love with you, guap, I'm in love with you, guap
Let a nigga try to take it, better come with his Glock
Better have thirty shots 'cause I got a fifty shot
And this motherfuckin' Glock, let it motherfuckin' pop
Like bop-bop-bop at an opp or opp thot
Let any opp try me, bet any opp drop
I don't care 'bout no thot, but I don't play 'bout my guap
And I pray that she don't leave me 'cause I fucked an awful lot
'Member posted on the block, runnin' from them cops
Rocks in my socks, Glock on my hip
Now I'm a young rich nigga named Sosa Baby
I love the guap like I love KayKay
You might also like
Girl, you is my baby, girl, you is my baby
I gotta smoke some weed 'cause, girl, you drive me crazy
Man, I wish a nigga try to take it
Thirty shots all to his brain, yeah
'Cause I'm in love with the guap, I'm in love with the guap
I'm in love with the guap, I'm in love with the guap
I'm in love with you, guap, I'm in love with the guap
I'm in love with you, guap, I'm in love with the guap14Embed
