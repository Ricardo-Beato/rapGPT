Metal Face DOOM
Operation Doomsday
You were very high
By the way, I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy (Pop-pop!)
In a instant, get smoked like Winston Cigarettes
Hoes get ripped off like Nicorette (Patch)
In real life, the real trife scene
Might snatch ya life like assault machine
Rifle, dead-up, setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white, or in full flight
The unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run, off the gun death tally commercial
Death Valley is like rehearsal to the streets, to my peeps
GM, MF on the beat
Rhymes is chosen like the weapons of war
So keep from steppin' on my floor or delivery front-door
I bring it to ya'll motherfuckers, master yours
My disaster cause.. Hell, in gas drawls
The supervillain cooler than a million, I be chillin'
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
(While I'm) Sendin' spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown within the comforts of your own home
Grown big, wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, it keeps the sty on my eye swollen
Holdin', foldin' the pal
Known as massive-versatile
I’d like to big-them-up Monsta Isle
You might also like
Uummm, yeah
I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Mhm

To my brother Subroc and Black Jewel, I crack brew for
Two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When givin' crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers that's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss
Or motherfuckin' Mother Goose
X the suspicious flirter who every hooker heard'a
Next to malicious murda
A track type vicious, fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal, minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve, don't breathe
Sixteen shots, I do believe, and one up the sleeve
Master of the O who predict ya last pause
I told y'all, Hell and gas drawls
Breakin' glass and plastic jaw like federal drastic law
Fed up from fightin' secret war wit' them Fantastic Four
(Invisible Bitch)
Versus Doom wit' the metal face
Before I go to state, the hoe better settle case
The flow is at pedal pace, steady like tricycles
Beware all suckas is froze like icicles (Bag 'em up)
And baggin' bitches like nickels 'cause I lick 'em where they tickle
Before I hit the clit though, I'mma spit 'til I pronounce
More hits than a ounce, no doubt
About ta' bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out
And I like to give a shoutout to the brother Jet Jaguar
Megalon and King Geedorah
I call this joint right here Gas Drawls
In Hell with yours21Embed
