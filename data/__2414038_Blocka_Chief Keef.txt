Franklin and Choppa
Can't trust every face bitch I gotta watch
That's why I need Ben Franklin and Choppa

Can't trust every face bitch I gotta watch 'em
That's why I need Ben Franklin and Chop' (bang, ayy)
Try me and we gon' send you to the doc'
Got plenty Glocks, FNs and chops
They go blocka
Blocka blocka, blocka blocka, bang bang
Blocka blocka, blocka blocka, bang bang
Blocka blocka, blocka blocka, bang bang
Who talkin' about Almighty Sosa? Bang bang
Blocka blocka, blocka blocka, bang bang
Blocka blocka, blocka blocka, bang bang
Who talking about Almighty So? (bang bang bang, ayy)
Who talking about Almighty So? (bang bang)

Pull up flexin' on everybody I see
Everybody wanna be like Keef
Everybody don't like Keef
But won't nobody try Keef
Like a hookah, smokin' Tooka
You smokin' fufu, call it G
Bitch, I ain't no fucking Mubu
I'll leave you Tutu (bang bang bang)
Guns go blocka (bang bang, bang bang)
Sosa a crazy mothafucka (bang bang)

Round, shootin' niggas down (Bang)
Where my fuckin crown? (huh)
Bitch, I'm King Glo (King Glo, Almighty)
Tryna copy my style, no Kinkos  (no kinkos, kinkas)
I'ma lion from the wild, you a fish, Finding Nemo
Actin' like Sub Zero, gon' leave his ass defroze
I'm flexin' on, niggas pissed
I see you walkin', got a pistol (bitch)
Shoot it at me, you know I'm down lil nigga
I can fuck your sister and your mama, lil nigga (lil nigga)
You don't want no drama, lil nigga (lil nigga)
Bullets flying like comets, lil nigga (lil nigga, like comets)
Choppas go brrocka brrocka, lil nigga
Block guns go bang bang and ping ping
30 shots in this ning ding
Got a 50 and a 40, ayy, lil shorty
You ain't got more money than my shorties
I gave some money to my shorties
They gon' come and kill your ass for me
Blocka, blocka, scoppa
Pussy nigga, I need an Oscar
I need a Grammy for my grandmama, ayy
Flexin' on every woman, everybody, let they know (flex)
I mean, act like they ain't know (haha)
Sosa was gonna blow, makin' big dough
Now I'm with Interscope
Jimmy Iovine, fuck with me though (what up)
Chris, fuck with me though (Chris)
Tadoe, that's my cousin though, ayy
You know how I'm rockin' though (how I'm rockin')
Pistols get to poppin', hoe (bang)
You tell me you love me, stop it hoe (stop)
Tryna set me up for my diamonds, hoe (dang)
I'ma shoot you right there in your throat (bang)
Put this dick down your throat (bang)
Send your lil dumbass home (haha)
You a thot but you thought I was wrong (nah)
Wanna Glo? Just be like Chief Keef, 'lieve me (Almighty, hear me out)
Who these niggas? I don't know these peewees (nah, what this about?)
Bitch, I'm rockin Herman's peewee (Herman's, get me out)
Gold, my necklace look like peepee
You might also like
Can't trust every face bitch I gotta watch 'em
That's why I need Ben Franklin and Chop' (bang, ayy)
