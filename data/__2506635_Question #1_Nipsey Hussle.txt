26 ContributorsQuestion #1 Lyrics
What they call you where you from, nigga?
Looking at the legend I become, nigga
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga

I'm a 108 bus catching
Blue line train riding, westsider with the young extras
These old rules came with no questions
Wrong to live by them but it's no exceptions
Was young and reckless with loaded weapons
The code of ethics lead to self destruction
When it's over, you left with nothing
This life ain't it boy, better check the subtext
Or the fine print, felt entitled to this fly shit
Felt like every bad bitch should be on my dick
Felt like niggas lied to us on some fraud shit
Fuck it, that's just how the ball bounce on some boss shit
Right here with all my brothers, on some squad shit
All money, one nation under God shit
Naybahood, Nipsey Hussle, on some boss shit
AKA nigga born broke, gotta die rich
You might also like
What they call you where you from, nigga?
In my city, that was question number 1, nigga
Looking like the legend I become, nigga
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga

A nigga had the nerve to walk up on me ask me where I'm from
I told him I ain't bang, he didn't listen so I gave him one
Not the cididy one, nigga try to hit him up
Now you wanna get him up, set it up and wet it up
Now from the hood, checking niggas on the daily
Started off BG, OG, baby
Real live homie, two heaters in my seat
Had to check a nigga at the Compton Swap Meet
Where you from? I don't bang
Where you live? Where you hang?
Say the wrong thing, and bang
Lights out, kites out to the homies in the pen
Crippin' in the city, we ain't let the cuz in
A lot of niggas camouflage, try to blend in to fit in
Get a hood rat so they set in
But if she got a brother, a daddy, or a cousin
They hit your ass up like motherfuckers, where you from, cuh?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
In my city, that was question number 1, nigga
Looking like the legend I become, nigga
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga2Embed
