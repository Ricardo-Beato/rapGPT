Stay off the weed
Hm-hm, hm-hm
Hm-hm (Roy, baby), hm-hm
(Day-Day-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

While I cough up this blunt, I sit back in the cut
All my niggas ridin' with me, more excuses to stunt
And we fill up the cup, and we fill up the Woods
Loud bang out the truck and the Range lookin' good
Get your girl off her, hey, said she ready to play
It's all a game, it's all a game, and I'm doin' my thang
More rage, more rage, black Porsche in the rain
Someone stop me, bitch, get off me, man, my life ain't the same
Natural killer, born and suddenly feelin' in pain
Now it's like I'm on my Sepeher and I'm feelin' them games
Been through hell and back, made it, it's a wrap
Can't keep a nigga down, down, baby, that's a fact
And I rep it, Cleveland, city runnin' through my veins
To BK, East New York, and I never change
Uh-uh, keep my niggas close, just like I'm supposed
'Cause this is for my people, truth is what I wrote, uh-huh

And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want (Yeah-yeah)
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want (Yeah-yeah)
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Yeah-yeah, hey)
You might also like
Feel like writin' a movie, yeah, that shit would be groovy
Anything that I want, anything that will move me
Next step, I'm on my shit and I'm livin' with love
And I'm crushin' all praises to my angels above
Take a trip, a couple women, couple shrooms with the group
Set a mood to the tune, rockstar in the news
Rockstar on your tube, nah, my nigga, you lose
Keep my head up, never let up and my face what I choose (Woah, baby)
On this journey, fronto burnin', castin' signs in the clues
And I'm drippin', yes, you catchin' Virgil tag on the shoes
Can't forget I'm on zoom, Cudder back on the moon (The moon, the moon)
Cudder back on the moon

And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want (Yeah-yeah)
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Let's go)
And I feel like I can do what I want (Yeah-yeah)
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want (Yeah-yeah)3Embed
