4 ContributorsPressed for Time Lyrics
I woke up in a mansion
Grew up in apartments
Put your 'partment inside my closet, so stop it
Flying on a jet plane, surfing on my laptop
Headed back to England, pit stop in Belgium, just to eat some waffles
Then I went to Paris, Polo shirt and Khakis
My luggage game immaculate, way more than average
Cavalli frames and Bally belt
Bally shoes and Bally bag
Bally-ed up my Bally swag
Gucci Mane conceited
I said "Beat it, you're an alley cat"
Alley cat, you alley rat
My Cali girl got Cali swag and Cali cash
Louis frames and Louis bags
Damn, she got stupid ass
You just another , boy, so go ahead on with your groupie ass
Banked up, I'm tatted up
Gatted up, I stack it up
Smoking on that cannabis, but still, you get your head bust
Flyer than a pelican, higher than a pilot
Fresher than the kids when they mama get they taxes
Itinerary faxes, email me you bastard
Holler at my management
You might also like
It's Gucci
Let it run, Zay, let it run, let it run
Pressed for time right now
You feel me?
It's Gucci Mane LaFlare, man, Cha-ching!
Zaytoven on beat
Gucci Mane on the mic stand

Imma, imma, imma show off on the track
Imma freestyle, no hook, and tell em bring it back
Dirty money, filthy money, mixed in with that clean
So lit, so , big rocks in my wrist watch
Big clips, big bullets, fully hit the bully
Now the Uzi got the bully
Holy moly, Gucci Gucci
So your Rollie , cuz I'm ballin' ballin'
You know we brought the money, hold the money, show it, throw it
Throw the weed, sell the weed, package it and traffic it
My trap game is magnificent, I'm proficient in pushing it
She owe me 50 cents, you pushing it, I need my 50 cents
Shoutout to Yayo and , you know I fuck with 50 Cent
I'm hotter than a hottie with no bottom in a lobby with spray paint all on her body
And the spray paint reading "Gucci Gucci"
Colder than a penguin with a coat
Drinkin' smoothie, and I'm smoother than a barrel of 
Rah, rah, rah, pow
Poom!
Oh man, Bazuka gun!
Duh!
Oh man, man, just, shh, poisoning...
Ha ha ha
Silent killer, man, you know
Freestyle, no pad, no pen
I am on that Cognac
Cognaye
That's my liquor right there
You know, I got a liquor
Cognac mixed with Gin
Called Cognate
I got some blunts right now
Grape and original
Gucci Mane Cigarellos
(Get your smoke on!)
Okay, what else you got on the market, Gucci?
Finna come out with a movie, "The Autobiography of Gucci"
Finna write a book, it's gon' be called "Gucci Mane: The Life of Gucci"

The one-man rock band, my Breitling is my hype man (One-man rockband, my Breitling is my hype man)
I'm a one-man rock band, my Breitling is my hype man
Boosie on my bracelet, Diddy watch, Nelly wrist
Ross charm, Baby chain, Busta Rhymes necklace
One-man rock band, my Breitling is my hype man
(Gucci, Gucci)
We outta here...Embed
