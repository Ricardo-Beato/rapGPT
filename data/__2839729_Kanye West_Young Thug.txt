Wet-wet

Nigga, bet that (Thugger)
Man, you can bet that
And the girls love the Shotta boys with them big toys, yeah
Anybody card, nigga, I got it now, now
She was too wet-wet
Swear to God I ain't lyin', yeah
Nigga, you can't do that, yeah

Bet it all, bet it all (Bet)
She pulled up in a Benz truck
Chanel it up, Chanel it up (Yeah)
She peacock with the colors (Oh)
Middle finger, stick it up (Yeah)

Jeffery, be easy
After sex she gon' wanna get married
Seen many men on Maury
Claimin' "the kid ain't my baby"
But taste the cake, I gotta have her
Shower to the big red sofa chair
Play truth or dare
Jumpin' in the pool with no swimwear gear
You keep me 'ware lookin' like a peacock
Everytime we press she be rooster
Feelin' like the big block time shift
Number one Haitian, she in love with the voodoo sex (Yeah)
Flippin' on the mat yo (Ooh)
Like Olympians in Rio, oh
Blast off like the rocket man, piano (Yep)
Scream so loud, dolphins hear the signal
Bet it all, bet it all (Bet)
She pulled up in a Benz truck
Chanel it up, Chanel it up (Hey)
She peacock with the colors (Oh)
Middle finger, stick it up (Hey, yeah)
If you ain't never gave a fuck (Fuck, yeah)
Get behind her, put it in her butt
Then beat it up

Wamp-wamp, she, wet-wet (Mr. Jeffery)
Wamp-wamp, nigga, bet that, ayy (Jeffery)
Wamp-wamp, she wet-wet (Jeffery)
Wamp-wamp, ayy (Jeffery, ohh)

Lil' mama should bet that
Wet-wet, ayy, bet that
Wamp-wamp, oh, wet-wet (Jeffery)
Bet that, lil' mama, wet-wet (Thugger)

Bet it up, yeah yeah, bet it up, yeah
When I fuck it I'ma fuckin' fuck it up yeah
I ain't pillow talking, ain't tryna get stuck with
A fat bitch, fuck around and be your luck
Good problem, you can't never and you stuck with it
Girl I see you tryna inchy inchy up with me
Long as you operate your own motherfucking business
I'ma make sure that you never go without, get it
Fat bone that she feel on
Good eyes, you can't do wrong
Good feet looking unique
Pockets fat like Monique
Got a trophy with the Rollie
Now she acting like she owe me, owe me
Yeah, you don't ever ever owe me
Good luck like a four leaf, four leaf

Bet it all, bet it all
She pulled up in a Benz truck
Chanel it up, Chanel it up
She peacock wit the colors
Middle finger, stick it up
If you ain't never gave a fuck
Get behind her, put it in her butt
Then beat it up

Wamp-wamp, she, wet-wet (Mr. Jeffery)
