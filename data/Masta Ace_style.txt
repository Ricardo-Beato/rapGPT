Sit 'em on my lap like Santa
I want a sky blue Cadillac, wit' a 8-track and a floor model T.V. in da back
So I can race Shaq straight down LaBrea
Last one to get to Roscoe's buys tha waffles

And tha yacht, like Elmer Fudd got
Did Hammer sell that house yet? I wanna buy it
And rent each room out fo' a grand, like the Hyatt
I want my own football team, and stadium
Hey, fuck platinum, I wanna go uranium

I had dreams of fuckin an R&B slut
Plus I'm tryin ta be tha first in tha bently truck
On twenty-fo inches of chrome, tight shit
8 TV's an'a satellite dish
Playa hata waita cuz a nigga might switch
Two thou', three V-dozen white six
No matta what they do, boo, they can't see Tee
All these niggas frontin in their crib on M.T.V

Wit' a draw bridge, no hassle
Let tha chariot swing low, go grab 'em
Take 'em to tha airstrip, catch tha airship
Back to tha hub city, ????? (woo)

So I can ball out in Cleveland like a Cavilier
I wanna check wit' six zeros, two commas
Sean Jean slippas an', Fubu pajamas

I drove down rows, and buy everything sold
Bitches so cold they suck like, black holes
Roll thru tha mall, smokin like broken stoves
Stroll wit' King Tut gold thru orange chronic groves
Flows as hard as frozen poles
Wit' tha sold out shows that pack tha Rose Bowl
Pocket's so swoll I can buy ya soul
Mack an Ro want tha globe
Ballin' outa control

Nigga jam like Jimmay
Caught a rimmay, make em strip like Timmay
Niggas know my shit hot like tamale
In the V with 3 squales, no time to polly
M dot A dot J O R, may go far
Love how I lay those bars
Play those cars
Shit chromed out, zoned out
Club bound, these clowns show me love now
Mad years still at it, these niggas had it
On the radio's most added
Plus I got the street too and the 32-5
Rap for the love but gotta eat too, what
I got it covered like glove to hand
Whose the man, mad chicks love the van
They all wanna get in it then sit in it
Even fat ones, that can't fit in it
Cause they know my teams' special
Lay you on your back and undress you and bless you, yes you
It really is no task, getting the ass
The I-class, wood dash, making it last
I'm trying to see platinum plus, kick dust
Fabulous, trust, in god we must
Stay hot like hundred degrees, LP's & CD's
Hard to believe these, cops & DT's
Got lead like a pencil
How it feel when the world against you
You know we bench you
Keepin' yall high is essential, yo N-Y confidential

Georgio frames with no lenses, and dont know who my friends is
The rap game ain't nothing but snakes, nothing but fakes
That dont stop like no brakes
Thats life ain't it, niggas know the world tainted
Try to paint it, picture that, then frame it
I stay true in it, keep doing it, yo
Raps out my face til im blue in it
Put glue in it if youre trying to stick
These I N C niggas wrong ones to pick, must be sick
Must dont love your life, gun or knife
Must dont love your wife
On the radio drop gems, 200 a spin, locked in
Top of the chart, popping your heart
Lot of shit with me, dont I, blow the spot won't I
Fuckin with me's like poking out your own eye
I take it back, like a u-turn, I do burn
To whom it concern, niggas dont learn
All my people on the Hill like Lauryn, keep scoring
Getting G's like Warren
I'm trying to see platinum plus, kick dust
Fabulous, trust, in god we must

Hard to believe these, cops & DT's

Keepin' yall high is essential, yo N-Y confidential
Yo, Tarantino, roll like El Camino
New three chrome drop, maraschino
Red with the beige guts, front for what?
Looking crisp in a black mans wish, dont diss
Lotta hoes with new clothes & Parasuco's
Looking for those Lexo's & Expo's
Lotta rappers smelling theyself & telling theyself
They the hottest the shit on market to ever spark it
Soon they ain't hot no more, not no more
Songs ain't blowing up the spot no more
Got no tour, got no fans and no plans
No more Lex land's and shows for 10 grand
I drop shit thats toxic and make a cop get bru-tal, its futile
Second chance like a new trial, trying to win
Trying to blend, trying to get in, trying to fit in
The rap game ain't nothing but cliques, up in the mix
Up in these chicks, up in the blue six
Knocking Busta-buss, trust us
Flows is lus-cious, you can't crush us!

Party animal back at the tele now
Katie and her best friend turn up the celly now
Friend got big boobs, Katie got thick thighs
Put 'em both together and what I nice chick prize
Looking in some sick eyes, light green, I seen
Katie ass busting out the scenes with them tight jeans
(Damn katie, whoa, damn, you lookin'... god, yep)
Alchohol flowing now, bout to get stinkfaced
Katie says, "Here Ace tell me how this drink taste"
Not bad, what's this, sex on the beach yo?
Friend pulls out her boobs, that's what I reach for
Now I'm in the party mood, take a few more swigs
Clothes start coming off, I'm about to score big
Katie start kissin' and feelin' on her girlfriend
That's when the room starts spinnin like a whirlwind
Feeling like I'mma hurl then I fall face down
Not cool dude, I'm nude from the waist down
Look up drooling, I feel like an asshole
Katie got my wallet in her hand as my cash flow
Can't move a muscle now, somebody save me
This shit crazy, wonder what they gave me

Don't think it really can't down
It happens everyday

Wake up at the hospital, guess I just came too
First I see Mr. C, then I see Kane too
Then I see Jay C, Scoob Lover, Scrap, and
All of them looking like "Ace what happened?"
Usually my mind be sharp as a thumb tack
Maybe if I take a minute everything will come back
(I don't even know what... wait)
I know
I was with these two chicks, sippin on a few licks
Everything was humming right along like a new six
Next thing I know I was laying on the floor
And it feel like they hit me in the head with a few bricks
Then the room just really start to spin bad
Then I knew this night was gon' end bad
When they found all the money in my gym bag
That's when I realize that I been had
They took the cash then both of them dashed out
After that, not sure, must've passed out
God damn how stupid could I be
Nurse what's that you putting in my IV?
"Don't worry it's gonna help you rest, dear"
See her lips moving but her voice sounds less clear

The moral of the tale
Don't trust a cute face and a thin waist
Cause they all go to jail
Rappers go on tour, and many gonna score with a whore
That's for sure but there's more gon' fail
Think with your dicks, then add liquor to the mix
You can end up in the morge on the scale
These girls ruthless, worst then the guys be
Act like they want your puddin' pop, Bill Cosby
Waiting in the lobby with a little slick plan
Get up to the room and try to make a quick grand
Or maybe six grand if you leave your chains out
Her main thing is to bang your brains out
When you exhausted, laying with your clothes off
She gon' wait till your stupid ass dose offEmbed
Yeah
I was raised to the sound of the 70's
Earth, wind and fire, sounded so heavenly
Ohio players and Curtis Mayfield
Aretha Franklin's picture on a playbill
Al Green in a tight suit, all white
Minnie Riperton, high notes all night
Mom's even had a box full of 45's
Put the needle down, yea that sounds sorta live
Sound like the kind of groove I could rap over
Got drunk off the beat then I was back sober
Bring that part back, yeah I'ma murder that
Donny Hat on the track with Roberta Flack

Hide records
In the bag
Sneak them out before she notice that they gone
Gotta think
I don't know
Should I rap off my mom's favorite song?

Better hope I don't scratch it, or that's it
I'ma get my ass kicked, that's a classic
Can't explain that I was just borrowing it
Moms on a rampage lookin' for her Parliament
And Donny Hathaway feelin' like a cast'away
Hiding in grandmom's room more than half the day
If I told her that her Parliament at Brian crib
And nobody home now, I'mma be a crying kid
But it's seeming like I'm safe for the time being
My uncle gettin' all the blame, far as I'm seeing
I just gotta lay low like a snake belly
It's a sticky situation like grape jelly
I'm on the Titanic, or some other boat
Got my mother and her brother at each other's throat

Nineteen seventy something, nineteen seventy something

The final act, Brian's at the door
With a black and red nap sack
Came to bring the vinyl back
I put it back before anybody notices
He said, "close call", I said, "yeah, I know this is"
But I got away with it like the perfect crime
And made the fresh tape, man it was worth the time
An aggravation and stress almost made a mess
She'd have found out, it's me she would of laid to rest
But I'm over like a fat rat
That was smart it's a good thing you hid 'em in that backpack
It feels so good to get that out the way
Now I'm out the door, back out to play
I'm about to say these are the good time like Chic
And then I hear my mom shriek
Duval
Get back in here, (Uh-oh)
How did my record get scratched?
I know you did it
Go get my belt
C'mon ma'
That's it get my belt, now

I met this girl named Fantasy on wall street
From Tahiti, real Tahitian treat
She had a lot of pep, see, honey was peace
And she told me she liked my smile like Shanice
She danced at this club and made the guys holler
And in a minute made like a thousand dollars
The club that was run by Mr. Schweppes, he had a rep
And everybody watched they step
Cause word on the street was he was no joke
Had everything from crack, marijuana to coke
Later at the club saw this guy named Wayne
Who always bettin' money on the Giants game
As soon as it's on, yo, I stayed away
'Cause he the type who welches a bet and won't pay
I keep tryin' to tell him be a straight stepper
Somebody gonna slice him and send him to Dr. Pepper
Went to the bar checked the score
Got the bartender told him what to pour
He put it on my tab as he filled my cup
And told me the game was tied seven up
Around 12 o'clock she came out to dance
Had all the guys pushing just to have a chance
To spend a little money trying to see the rest
She was blessed, in an orange crushed velvet dress
But I stayed by the bar cause I already know how it go
I already saw the show
See I went to a club like this in Toronto
And came back from Canada dry with no dough
And ever since then I see and see clear
You never find love in this atmosphere
Sometimes you gotta find a better place to be in
Maybe go to a mountain, do a little skiing
So I finished up my drink and I said goodbye
And got home before the sun kissed the sky
No matter where you from or which way you leaning
Now goin' pop got a whole new meaning

Don't you know we got a lot in here

No it ain't Nelly but it's hot in here, we got it locked in here
Won't stop (you know), come and drink in numbers like h2o
Soon you gonna hear us everyplace you go
Bubble like the soda kinda like the soap
I just hope you know, it don't stop

The Y2K is a brand new era
I'm tryin' to make hits like Yogi Berra
I wonder how long I'll be in this biz
'Cause it's not all cheer like you think it is
There's a whole lot to gain but a lot to lose
Just ask any rapper who paid dues
Everybody now and then bound to struggle
I just grab my wife and we lay and snuggle
We talk about the ivory coast how one day
We gonna sail on the tide and get whisked away
Look up at the stars 'til the crack of dawn
Hold up I never leave your side for long
But for now I keep on making you bounce
And make sure something in my checking accounts
Grab my cell phone and then start to dial
Take a look at my life and start to smile
It's funny how the game make you change your tone
'Cause the joy of my life is the microphone
So I straighten up my act and keep doin' my thing
Gettin' the green, nah mean, getting it clean
Don't you know we got a lot in here
Wanna be a part of what we got in here
Sorta like we got the whole block in here
No it ain't Nelly but it's "Hot In Here", we got it locked in here
Won't stop (you know), come and drink in numbers like h2o

I just want to be large, large like Whodini
'Cuz fame from my name on a train and graffiti wasn't good enough
Maybe I was bein' greedy, but I thought I could be on TV
Fact is, Mike Jack set it on fire
But I moonwalk with an umbrella six months prior
In my school talent show
White gloves lock ticking
We was in the park, poppin' like hot chicken
I was on the block trynna' get my name known
And be the hottest in the hood like flame, on
Or maybe just the best in my building
Competin' with the rest of the children (who wanna battle)
Let the crowd judge who the winner is
They can be so cold like the winter is
My mama always said -"Have no fear"
And I will rise to the top like a cold beer
So I'mma hearse my lines on the F-train
The boy's famous, why should I have less fame?
The freaks came out at the night and they stayed out
Without a doubt I refuse to get played out
I had a big mouth - would not shut it up
I can prove I'm the best - just set it up
I feel like it's me against John Little
All I gotta do is show the world my skill
You might also like
Started with a dream, now the world knows my name
Just trynna' be the best, so I'll be on that Fresh Fest
You had to have skills, to get a record deal
You had to be the best, to get on that Fresh Fest

I just wanna hear my song on BLS
Couldn't care less about a brand new CLS
I ain't have my licence anyhow
Fat Boys had a show and made twenty thou- wow
You can get payed like that?
And all I gotta do is spit a tight rap?
I think i gotta few lines on stash
And I can have a rap game on smash
The boys better make room
'Cuz I can formulate a great tune, yep
Peter Piper picked peppers and Run rocked rhymes
I bet I can get known with one hot line
I bet I can get on with one hot song
I just need to be like the one Run rocked on
Or, get like +Flash+ so I can be the best dressed
Yes, yes, so I'll be on that Fresh Fest

Welcome everybody to the rap crucifixion
Every other day it’s like a brand new conviction
Another nigga down ‘cause he just didn’t listen
We the same mission trying to get out of his position
Listen, it doesn’t matter if you’re Muslim or Christian
Everybody need a little food in the kitchen
Hindus and Jews, they all feel the tension
And any other race or religion I didn’t mention
You hit the streets try to earn a little cheddar
Hoping that the cheddar’ll make your life a little better
Walking through the hood in the hundred dollar sweater
Looking at these cats that you’re trying to stay ahead of
See, what you’re facing is a wild situation
The hardest thing to do is try to be a little patient

Mom’s tried to tell you but you just didn’t hear her

Every other rapper fighting for a hit like Carrera
So recognize we live in a new rap era
Money, cash, hoes – the Guantanamera
Ain’t nothing changed!
Everyone still want the Benz and the Range
Everybody still want the gems and the chains
Everybody got a few friends in the game and they still act strange
The only thing different is the color of the Tims
The only thing different is the size of the rims
Now we got Foxy Browns and Little Kims
But they still fight, like Antoinette and Mc Lyte

Yeah, I was born, son of Yvonne
Brownsville kid that wanna be on
Hit the streets run an be gone
Outside with a curfew
Got lessons on honesty and virtue
And the people that'll hurt you
Drug addicts, ex-convicts
Living in a world surrounded by these conflicts
So many too many to mention
You can feel all the tension
A mom’s intervention
Tryn'na save her son from the worse fate
Getting home after 8 when she works late
Thank god for nana, I was in her control
In the lobby, sitting on tenant patrol
Cause folks getting robbed on a regular
By chain snatching dudes, just in it for gold
Son of Yvonne had a fight up the street
He’s a nice kid, but ain’t nothing sweet

All I do, I do it for you
It’s for all you did, when I was a kid
Cause there's mad friends ain’t wanna be born

Nana upstairs, making sweet potato pie
Cause it’s Christmas Eve
Under the tree, afx racing track
Pick up a gift, shake it, then place it back
I wonder what it is, instead of taking a guess
Next morning, open gifts, making a mess
Nana always sits in the same chair
Jackson 5, singing Rudolf the reindeer
In the background, I go upstairs
To see what Mike got
Then I come back down, to enjoy all
Nana good cooking
Life in the hood Brooklyn good looking
Son of Yvonne, Brownsville born and bread
And like that quilt, nana got on the bed
I’m a bunch of things, all sown together
To make one man, that'll be known forever

Ayo I'm going back to Cali
To all the ladies in the valley
And the weather more beautiful than Halle
And I done been all through the hood
My boy Dougie D, man he took me on a tour through the hood
Slauson swap meet, Crenshaw, stop, eat
Then go to Melrose, cop a pair of shelltoes
Then I'm jumpin' on the 5-North
First I gas up, and then I drive off
To the Bay, oh how I love it in the Bay
Same way I love it in LA
I get a lot of love up on Haight Street
Folks look up to me like I'm 8 feet
Tall, ayo the West Coast got it all
And every time I go, man I have a ball
Fun times, sunshine, that's right up my alley

Hey yo, I'm going back to Paris, France
And I must say, that you really should go if you have a chance
The culture, the music, the art
The food, the people, they real to the heart
This is genuine love, this is not a act
And I couldn'ta put it down on a hotter track
I hear a lot of cats talk a lotta smack
But I lost six G's, and I got it back
How real is that? Thinking the utmost
Respect from me against the world full of cut-throats
How could I lose a grip like that?
In a crowded sports bar and get it right back (I don't know)
It's like no place I ever went
And this'll be the biggest shout that I ever sent
To any city that I ever flew through
Merci beaucoup, I salute you
I'll be back, for now I'm gone

This is like a holiday you could celebrate
And if life got you down this'a elevate
Lift your spirits up, make you feel hella great
Put the pedal to the metal and accelerate
This'a put you on the road, on the right path
It's Ace and Ed, you done met up with a tight staff
I could do this in my sleep, this is like math
This is in my blood, I used to write graff'
And I still write with style, I been doing this a while
If I tell you when I started this, you might laugh
And it's been a winding road like a bike path
But I'm still so cold, you a slight draft
Such a bad motherfucker, kinda like Shaft
Shut your mouth, this is just the first half
And we still got two more quarters
Take our passports across a few more borders
Lets go

This remind me of summertime in the park
Late night hip-hop, turn it up in the dark
This remind me of back home, off the road
Good food slow-cooked, big pot on the stove
This remind me of treacherous, fearless
Cold Crush, no rush, take your time, hear this
This remind me of (1), this remind me of (2)
This remind me of (3), this remind me of you

I mean these animated rhymes like cartoons
Y'all remind me of sheep when I play it in my Jeep
Y'all put me to sleep like car fumes
Play this on your jukebox in your bar room
Who the best? Who the worst? all this arguin'
Won't matter when the smoke clear
Hip-Hop's not dead yet, there's a little hope here
What I'm saying on the mic sounds so clear
Kneel down now and bow like the Pope here
Got our independence, and we staying free
Hear me, Ed and Ace, yup A&E

Man eater, Hannibal, animal
Campaign manager like Rahm Emanuel
My flow is so intangible
When I spit, and open up my mandible
Ya hate, understandable
Cause my reach is infinite and expandable
AYY!! (uh-huh)
Write on my phone, I'm bored with ink
The more shit you pile on, the more it stink
What I possess and profess can pause your progress
Beef gets addressed, rappers is hard-pressed
Think move like chess
Or get bullets, removed from the flesh of your chest
Some people, are destined for success
But me, I determine my success
Embed
Yeah, A&E, uh
Uh-huh, uh, yeah (woo!)
Uh... woo! Yeah, yo, yeah

Y'all made noise off a phony promo, in a group off homie's solo
We cowboy these rappers like Tony Romo
Rip they posters, spit on they logo
Open the ProTools, erase they vocals
My point focal, I-N-T y'all so local
I'm so global, noble mobile to mobile
See it in slow-mo, take a photo
We burn kids like Chernobyl
Cause my shit together like Ice-T and Coco
Or Pearl Harbor, and Yamamoto
Y'all in the streets like hobos, let me tally up the total
You wanna fit in? I stand out
Don't try to get in, with your hand out
You ain't a shady thug, you a ladybug
Who fly around friendly, homie don't try to play me scrub
You soft as baby wipes and baby rubs
And MC's is now pushin' daisies up

Hands, up, high
Get your hands up, hands up high
Get them up but we not gon' stick you
Get them high and we just might pick you
Get your hands, up, high
Get your hands up, hands up high
Get them up 'til you touch the sky
Get your hands, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up
Hands up high~!

Your girl lips cute, played a medley on the flute (flute)
A&E heavy like a Chevy on the loop
Drown y'all niggas, break a levee on your group
Look, I see them rims on that new coupe
Ooh, but stop fuckin' with the E, cause this is like a coup
And stop fuckin' with me, this is like a clue
We will get you stuck, this is like a glue
The industry's so full of snakes and, predators
Out on the prowl, nigga this is like a zoo
This that walk-in one-take banger
We got way harder shit, this is like a two, c'mon


Yeah, yo
I say what I want, don't care about the backlash
Call me a genius, call me a jackass
All you do is talk trash with your wack ass
A&E stack cash on these niggas black ass
Act gassed, Edo go hard, no half-ass
No comparison or contrast
Shake my hand you touch great, I frustrate
You hold shit together with bubblegum and duct tape
Yo, we walk with a torch, we be on the march
We stiff competition like, easy on the starch
Y'all a bunch of country bumpkins
Y'all should be home eatin' chicken lookin' greasy on the porch
We in it for the win (win)
Next mixtape drop, y'all DJ's better spin it in your blend

I'm about to take this beat and teach you bout the agony of defeat
In this football game in the street
And no it ain't two hand touch, it's rough tackle
When niggas ball on your block and they bust at you
The field's full of players, and they all trying to score
The whole team sits on the bench in the down pour
Cause no matter the weather, the game don't stop
Competing with other teams, that reign on top
Your offense gotta be cats with no conscience
No-nonsense niggas, with no options
That know how to carry that rock
Make the hand-off and run off the block
It's hard to get first down when your new in this rough town
You sell a pound its a touchdown
And niggas see the pigskin, they blast cops
So federal agents dress as mascots
Niggas hold weight but it's not for lifting
The only white lines is the ones niggas sniffing
I know it sounds a bit different, the only quarter is a quarter ki
If that ain't a penalty, it oughta be
And the concession stand is so sick
Serving you the cat, rat and dog on a stick
But if you ask why somebody got slain
Yo, it's just an unfriendly game
You might also like
The game don't stop, cats keep playing
Some got hit hard and wound up laying
Out in the field but the fans keep paying
Understand what I'm saying
It's just an Unfriendly Game
This ain't America is it
This ain't America is it
Where can I be

Yo, a'yo it's Monday night
We on some watch the game shit
But I can go outside and still see the same shit
Cause look, there's a bunch of niggas in a huddle
Looks like they calling the play
Come on kids, don't be all in the way
Cause that's Pookie, he the fucking quarterback
Cause he like to use the shotgun if he don't I know he got one
And that's Budda he the fucking running back
Cause he always say he gone quit
And he always wind up running back
The rest of them
I'll just say they play the line
Cause they like to protect Pookie and Pookie make them stay in line
And if they make a wrong move they penalized
Not by the referee but by Pookie brother Jeffery
And Jeff don't touch shit, he sit and watch
Oversees the whole block, from his own private luxury box
He the one that makes the deals happen
Smoking big cigars while his stars are in the field scrapping
But tonight the line of scrimmage got penetrated
The block got raided, and everybody got traded
Now they wearing stripes in a pen
Guess that's how the game go
Nigga, you don't know?
Highlights at 10
Wednesday police arrested 12 men in a downtown drug raid
The cartel known on the streets as the Sharks
Was transporting large amounts of marijuana
In shipments of little league football equipment

There's a new team in from out of town
What's the sound
Out of bounds
And the front line niggas stay ready for the blitz sonny
So you won't make a sack of money
And every now and then, somebody drops the ball
And the next team be right there to take it all
Now somebody new is trying to make a score in your territory
It's the same old story
And if you want your corner back you better wear a vest
Just in case, you gotta catch a bullet to the chest
Believe me that shit can be a humdinger
Cause every quarterback in this league's a gunslinger
The half-time show's kinda ill
Hood rat bitches dancing to Dru Hill
Another nigga down and out
A crackhead with no name, yo
It's just an unfriendly game
The game don't stop, cats keep playing
Some got hit hard and wound up laying
Out in the field but the fans keep paying
Understand what I'm saying
It's just an Unfriendly Game
This ain't America is it
This ain't America is it

I'm smart as a whip, y'all slaves to the rhythm
Colorful bright flows, sun rays in the prism
Like a hundred days in the prison, I'm acclimated
I'm in the building, y'all dudes get evacuated
Mind grows while your campaign slows
And champagne flows are extra dry, I'm saturated
I go deep and I ain't talking about scuba diving
Listen here, get a career in Uber driving
You're nothing more than a sidekick, you're Super Robin
Selling verses mad cheap, you're two for fiving
Me and A's like merging traffic
We come together and do this for nerds and black kids
And they know the words of classic
But y'all won't give it up like virgin tactics
So we stay grinding like teenage boys
On teenage girls, listen up, we make noise
Loud like the ball dropping in Times Square
Stopping all that mall hopping, these rhymes here
You can get on Black Friday, no bait and switch
I'm aiming for your head like a blatant pitch
And you don't wanna rush the mound
KIC Beats on the beat, can't touch the sound
Me and AG are endangered species
And y'all cats flows is feces, fuck outta here

Think it's time we leave? Not yet
I'm like Oooh, no boss, no rules, no school
Fly like the first pro tools
Don Cornelius on the 6 Line to Pelham Bay
Rested on the seventh day, tell em hey
6th Grade, in love with the beats
Got to junior high, Kurtis Blow on repeat
Dropped outta high school, nigga had to eat
Never went to college, graduated from the streets
Once you hear the capital A, rap it'll stay
With you for a while, won't go away
So I hit em with the heat, watch em spin like clothes driers
Holy water, leave holes in your ghost writers
Love at first sight is how I carry it
I'm so underground, my Queen named Harriet
New York shit, clones ain't permitted
Credit if you wrote it but respected if you live it
I shine like the moon during prohibition
I'm so efficient, eMC is the coalition
A lot of lames is running up in the game
Cause the sign at the door has changed
It reads 'no admission'
There's no pride in the free riding I know it's missing
I get on tracks, shit on cats and the flow is pissing
Straight urination on these kids' dreams
I'm Robert Kelly on a 16, extreme
The big thing between you and yours truly
I'm on the block, my system knocking, a Ford Dually
You in the park with a pedal bike with a transistor
Lazy don, your baby mom's is your man's sister
A bad twister we touch down and destroy your town
Me and AG, yeah we tore it down
These boys cold, wait, no, we more than freezing
That's the reason y'all tuned in, it's the Falling SeasonEmbed

Young black intelligent, this is not a first
But it feels like it's curse and it weighs like a elephant
Heavy on my mind, 'cause I feel so irrelevant
Heavy on my heart, it's like I'm smart for the hell of it
Heavy on my soul, it's our stroll through the 'ville again
Stranded on this island, feel like I'm Gilligan
Friends got jailed and then they got bailed
Stress that I'm under, I just wonder when they kill again
Please understand that I'm living in the concrete
Jungle where I stumble is the crumble under my feet
In the building lobby, see my man Bobby
Puffing on a joint that's the point where our eyes meet
Asked what's the weight on the books in my knapsack
He's so amused, I'm confused why he asked that
Then I understand the motive and the plan
He's trying to be the man while I stand getting laughed at
Dudes got jokes but very little hopes
That's why they trying to bring me down like a halfback
But I got balanced, my moms made a promise
If I get the grades, I'll be praised like Thomas
Clarence; but I don't know if law's in my future
Cops in the war and they'll sure try to shoot ya
All I wanna do is get a B in geometry
Lose my virginity and live my life drama free; sing

I might die - I might die
But I'll be free - but I'll be free
So why be I? why be I?
Why be me? - why be me?

Young Black...

Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your dreams
A dime for your goals and a quarter in your jeans
Trying to make a dollar outta forty-one cents
Caught up in the barbed wire, shorty on the fence
I can be a knife-packing, gun-toting hooligan
But I can't decide so I'm on my way to school again
On my way to duel again, me against the world
But all I can think about is me against a girl
Youthful exuberance, busting at the seams
Look at all the other kids cussing at the deans
Looking at all the other kids cutting 8th period
But I'm on a team and my coach won't hear of it
He's well aware of it, I ain't getting pinched
Y'all dummies go ahead I ain’t getting benched
Whole lot of right and a little bit of wrong
And everything you've worked for? Gone
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I? - why be I?
Why be me? - why be me?
If I fly - if I fly
They gon' see -  they gon' see
I might die - I might die
But I'll be free - but I'll be free
So why be I? why be I?
Why be me? - why be me?

In this state of emergency and sense of urgency
Just how young is young?
Cause the youth be not youth for long
Young society might be afraid of you
But you continue to be you
We are you, so we feel you
For that those that see you
We salute you
Continue to find like minds, brah
Design your inside, concentration, desire
Dedication, inspiration, perspiration
Is the hard work
Doesn't guarantee anything
But without it, you don't stand a chance
Intelligence will save you

Hello everybody
How you doing guys?
Today I want to show you
A very good mathematic trick
Ok, you're gonna love this treat
Because it's a great one
And uh let's do it

Ya'll little rap cats ain't figured this
The specimen, regiment is rigorous
The hate so exponential, my potential
Means there's only couple bars for a nigga dis
Is it geometry or trigonometry?
Try counterpull the currency that I'mma see
And where I'mma be is on top
Like a numerator, fast, it's the cash accumulator
Try to follow after this is like Calculus
It's hard to calculate, what you about to miss
I'm like a fully grown tree when I bare fruit
I'm feeding ya'll from the branch to the square root
Yeah and I don't give a damn if you flip a Pi
The meaning still the same but I'm a different guy
Don't need no body double, this is real stunting
It's simple mathematics, Good Will Hunting
I turn a negative into a positive
This is what I got to give and how I opt to live
My philosophies, you can try every angle
But can't hang though, isosceles
Hypotheses, the education that I share so cold
Man watch how I drop degrees
I will convert ya'll, like Celsius to Fahrenheit
When I grab the mic, watch me work ya'll
I'm up next like that bullet you find in the chamber
Subtract them and find me, yes I'm the remainder
Dominant, in my path is prominent danger
KIC Beats the producer and I'm the arranger
Filthy Rich on the boards like a power forward
And EMC be the crew that I'm a tour with
From '88 to infinity, my energy
Made the crowd move like Synity
Yeah another 500 decimal joint
Every line I be making my decimal point
I'm used to the doubts and the skepticism
But won't budge an inch, I'm the metric system
Listen, listen don't make the wrong decision
Cause we will not work it out man, long division
Another song vision, another product of hard work
Against all odds, this is God's work
You might also like
I hope you guys enjoyed this trick
Its a really cool one isn't it?
And yah, have fun with it
I'm going to show you many more cool tricks
Coming soon and
Times up, thanks very much
I will see you next time

Alright
We got a rap battle going on today

This what you call that old high school shit
That your school not better than my school shit
I can't listen to them lies you spit
You gonna homecoming for real, I was saying?
Yeah it's that high school shit
That your school is not better than my school shit
I can't listen to them lies you spit
You gonna homecoming for real, keep playing

This what you call that old high school rivalry
I'm about to go in on your school entirely
Y'all grades be the opposite of straight A's
The hallways full of conflicts and melees
You straight craze and your school's for the weirdos
A bunch of queer bro's in heels and weird clothes
Your mascotte get backshots, to share folder
A whole team full of zero's, what you here for?
Half your school bang, the rest are into dealing
Your old ass school got asbestos in the ceiling
And the gas leaking, lead paint is on the walls
And mad dudes and broads be fainting in the hall
Comparing your school to mine just ain't smart
Aside from the girls is burning, ya ain't hot
The dean is a fiend, the principal smoke pot
And the halls is so dirty that the roaches broke out
Man, look at your school and look at my school
Yours just more like a jail than a high school
Run by the head of detectives, metal detectors
Cops in every class cause they better protect us
Yo check this, our schools ain't in the same league
Your lunch lady got a mustache and gold teeth
You meet your demise from meeting my lines
From snacking on the murder burgers and suicide lines

You really shouldn't do this, I think it's best to listen
I'm about to give this dunge rat attention
Your team starts at five, designed to ride benches
Your only championships is Special Olympics
I heard your basketball coach got a baby by a tenth grader
He'll be changing diapers on the bench later
During the time out in the game that ya losing bad
Arguing with his point guard about who's the dad?
I warned you son but you just wouldn't heed
The editor of your school paper can not read
Your prom queen Steve his floor burns on the knees
And most likely to succeed, nah mean
Your school nurse is obese and got diabetes
Putting Robitussin on her broken finger
The gym teacher dropped like five CD's
And your lunch lady swears that's she the dopest singer
I smack Catholics in boarding schools
Your Delaney Card name reads born to lose
Your class valedictorian forty two
Ya better tell 'em who he talking to, warn this dude
Please you can't spell valedictorian
Ain't no chance that you can win this war we in
You better tell these Dowey boys, all we do is spit
And sit, we on that high school shit, yeahEmbed


Yeah, my mom's saying, "No way you going to Jefferson
That's a school where kids be sneaking their weapons in"
Around here, Jeff is where they gon' put ya
Or Maxwell but they ain't even got football
10 more points and I would have gotten into Brooklyn Tech
Oh well, what other schools are we looking at?
It's Midwood and South Shore and Edison
They all full, so no way they gon' let us in
Fort Hamilton High School is dumb far
That's like two trains and a bus or one car
Stuyvesant they sent the nice poster to us
But there where some schools a whole lot closer to us
Erasmus Hall, boys and girls, some other places
Moms thinks I should go to school with some other races
Italians, Jews, Russians and Armenians
Dominicans, West Indians, you'll make plenty friends
Just be ready for a real bad racial tone
Them white boys don't hesitate to chase you home
Then we settled on Sheepshead Bay
My man work out there and he said: "hey"
Long as ya dudes don't come out try to act a fool
Everything gon' be real cool after school
But act up and they gon' chase y'all cats
All the way back to the hood with baseball bats
Damn, that's a long bus ride to a foreign land
But I'm ready to hit the scene like Marlon Bran'
All I need is some new clothes from Aqueduck
And the rest of these cool Joe's can pack it up
Sheepshead Bay, strange name, yes it is
And I vow to be one of the freshest kids
So fresh I'mma be having you vexed
When I arrive at 3000 Avenue X

She swings as the girl and the boy cries on
I look at this man and he looking at me
We thinking to eachother oh my God, that's wrong
But we don't get involved, cause nothing getting solved
It's plain to see that that lady got a habit
Six months pregnant, with a third
Whatever's in her blood man that baby's gonna have it
Dreams unattainable so let me explain to you
It's insane and it's so painful when in plain view
Close my eyes, trying to avoid the pain too
I knock out and inner shout, i came to
Now we on a different block, different area
Little leerier and the projects is scarier
Uh unless you come from this part of town
With the people, the paper bags and the water brown
Lotta dudes they do lose when they brought around
It's so steep and so deep and you sure to drown
Man, do you get where I'm going?

Eh yo, I got to watch my back as I travel through
Rockaway and Livonia, Picken Avenue
Belmont, New Lot, Stone and Saratoga
I just wanna slice the piece and maybe have a soda
But if I try to rock this leather and this nameplate
Like my man Nate I can meet the same fate
He in the wheelchair, knife in the spine man
My friends like: "yo come on, we'll be fine man"
But see this black suede Puma's with the gold stripe
Are hot of the press and yes it's a cold night
The type of night when all coasts seem suspicious
I know we ain't no bitches but these streets are vicious
Bus stops, alleyways and them side blocks
It's the few spots you can wind up in a pine box
Last car of the A train, it ain't sane
Play around, you lay around in great pain
And now the kid ensure like weight gains
Tell me why would you wanna die for a fake chain?
Shit, why you wanna die for a real one?
Cause real bullets they kill when they fly from a real gun
Man I'm a err on the side of caution
Because this stuff my moms bought was a small fortune
For this great advice you gone thank me thoroughly
Labyrinth, caught in this maze, Frankie Beverly
You might also like
Fire burning
Hot all over them streets
And this world is falling
Because they don't care about me
And we, humanity
We must fight
Fight for the sake of life
Fight for the sake of our children

Being I'm a only child and moms keeps a steady job
I stay fresh to death and yes they ready to rob
These suede Wallabees got 'em on the cheap friend
And my sheepskin same color as a wheat thin
These Cazal frames really are a rare color
But I'm not ready to die like hair color
All I want to do is impress the ladies
Cause this be the eighties and it's wild over here brother
Walk lightly or end up in a fight see
Unless you wanna lose that there, hold it tightly
Since grade school, been fresh from the start dawg
And that makes me a target like a dartboard
So I gotta stay on point like church shoes
And the first rule's watch out for the worst dudes
One false move and moms have to bury me
Try to make it through this maze, Frankie Beverly
Universal ghetto survivors

I first learned what a labyrinth is
In AP class with all the talented kids
This game had a ball and your goal was to get it home
And if it fell in the hole, then you did it wrong
Man, my hood be sort of the same
You can get robbed in the bus, on court or the train
Yup, I'm already stressed, please don't worry me
Labyrinth, this here maze, Frankie Beverly

Fire burning
Hot all over them streets
And this world is falling
Because they don't care about me
And we, humanity
We must fight
Fight for the sake of life
Fight for the sake of our children

Uh, a dollar short of having a dollar
Being broke in the hood is a curse
Hit the Ave, you know how to fix it
I know it's bad but could have get worse
I see these kids, they might wanna jump me
But I'm not gonna show 'em I'm scared
I just know I'mma find me a way out
They gonna know I was hereEmbed
I'm from the city brother, New York, New York city
Well that's the alcohol and drugs, steal the soul of a young pretty mother
Thick hips and thighs, caramel complexion
The inspiration for some teenage affection
Jordache jeans tight like some running pants
Got a brother speaking French like a son in France
"Bonjour Mademoiselle", sexy older lady
You can rob this cradle like somebody stole a baby
I'm only 15, but I'mma fast learner
I know your man got a 'fro like he Nat Turner
I know your man drive a Eldorado
But I'm been try to take a rest on some breasts since I held the bottle
"Eh yo that's Rodney mom", I know that's Rodney mom
But when she get dressed for work, eh yo that body bomb
Like a Saudi bomb, I want to set it off
Cause that booty extra big and I bet it's soft
So many nice curves, I'm Mario Andretti
I wanna ride but I'm prolly sure ain't ready
I heard she party hard and she be hanging
With the hustlers cats Big Black, Shameek and Robby Rob
Then came the white powder
Every man try to get all the clams that he can like some white chowder
And they gave it to their ladies first
I'm just try to keep the tears out my eyes while I say this verse
You might also like
You ok?

Huh? What's wrong?
Why you sitting here?
Say what?

Doing this dayjob, tell you it stay hard
Damn it the pain robs, my spirit's will fade far
Each moment the brain's on CoreNet
Cause the reds and the bread gone
Medical bills that swell more
Caring for my unwell moms
But it's Karen who I depend on
Detent to Sean, whose tender nights I work long
Graveshifting it, got the grey hairs glistening
Looking Claire Huxtable minus Cliff and when
The last time I tried hollering at him
We just rifted and drifted in
Some nights I want to escape this prison
Get away where ignorance is blistering
Where pain stops existing
Watch it dissipate with the wade
See the shift in my fade
Face countenance
It was like I was bound to slip, cursed
I'm just try to keep these tears out my eyes while I say this verse
You alright?
Because I'm looking at your eyes to see if your pupils is big
What's wrong with her?
You doing some drugs?
Huh?

Fat ass dissolving, like cotton candy
Grown ladies calling dealers daddy
But yo that's not your family
Lotta women like to cop from Stanley
Then go home and wash away the shame
Drinking lots of Brandy
Cause he be on that barter system
Where a pretty New Jack City chick becomes a Carter victim
Off your knees lady, he's deceiving you
And like your new job, that body, it be leaving you
I believe in you, you somebody mama
And as a man he should protect you, like body armor
But he's a hottie charmer and you under a spell
Now the whole neighbourhood is a thunderous hell
Lotta shorties left at home, cause their mama's gone
What's a young kid to do with all that time alone?
Man, they should have put the babies first
I'm just try to keep the tears out my eyes while I lay this verseEmbed
Still here
Somehow

Man, it took me 15 years to understand my worth
It was 1988 when Marley planned my birth
Had to get my feet up out of the sand and surf
Never thought that my rap lines would span the earth
But they did, went to every corner of the globe
It's time to reveal, since y'all really wanna probe
I went from Brownsville kid, gone to King's County
To Queenstown, sitting in a sauna in a robe
And since then, never took a day off from the pen
I understood hard work would pay off in the end
Yeah for as long as my body is strong
I'mma give it all I got, try to body a song
I'mma give it all I got, try to rip that show
And yo, understand I got to get that dough
And so, cause I know how to spit that flow
Sold out three nights in a row, like Tic-Tac-Toe
In the fast lane, kick back slow, no need to rush
We royalty, bow down at the feet of us
The anticipation, it's like
Standing on the corner in the cold and you can see the bus
It's finally here, our arrival
Raised in the ghetto, singing songs called survival
We stand, united by the beat, man
Tight plan, right hand on the Bible

Real is what I be

This the story of me

Just try to make history
Gotta make history (history)
Ain't no mystery
Gotta make history (history)
Know my history
Gotta make history (history)
Can't shake destiny
Just gotta make history, yeah, yeah, yeah

I almost had the nineties by the throat
I was just that close to getting money by the boatload
Instead of hoping what I wrote flowed
I could have said: "Whoop, there it is"
But it would have felt so wrong to do that song
Try to prove I belong in a crew that strong
Listen, understand, this is preordain
This is written by God then we all came
Could have signed with Def Jam but Lyor changed
Changed his mind at the strangest time
He was still destined to sign a dangerous mind
Another cat with the grind the same as mine
Another son born on the fourth would come
He was of course the one with that course to run
And like a ham sandwich on the softest bun
I refuse to eat it, I will not be defeated
Here to stay and get a lot completed
This what I got to offer, what I got is needed
Confident but I'm not conceited and I swear
The same mistakes I made will not be repeated
I choose to keep paying up dues
Life try to beat me up like scuffed shoes
It was hard, doctor called me off guard
Same place I was born, got the rough news
We rise, we fall and pray
For better days
Why shoot we for the stars
And prayed for better aim?
The world, the pain remained
It never change
Long as the sun will show
The cold is still the same
Just try to make history
Gotta make history
Ain't no mystery
Gotta make history (history)
Know my history
Gotta make history (history)
Can't shake destiny
Just gotta make history, yeah, yeah, yeah
We rise, we fall and pray
For better days
Why shoot we for the stars
And prayed for better aim?
The world, the pain remained
It never change
Long as the sun will show
The cold is still the same
Just try to make history
Gotta make history (history)
Ain't no mystery
Gotta make history (history)
Know my history
Gotta make history (history)
Can't shake destiny
Just gotta make history, yeah, yeah, yeah
The story of me, never would have knew me without it
And they won't make a movie about it
I mean, I guess they could but truly I doubt it
Mad friends watching Ralph McDaniels, knew me and shout it
Oh snap, that's Duval, he live in my building
Life in the PJ's, living and building
Whether you in Seflo or living in Tilden
Trying to escape men, women and children
A product of the same and when I got into the game
Initially my moms was really shocked and ashamed
She was like: "Boy you got a Bachelor's"
And I was like: "Why they call it a b.s?"
Bullshit walks as far is what I was taught
Yet I ain't had one job interview and she stressed
The story of me, born from the story of us
Studio bound, the story of us
My Honda's in the shop, no warranty
I need a new regulator, no Warren G
But I'mma get by, do or die
And then I left URI
I looked around and then came the yellow tape
I decided to sit on chrome and accelerate
And after that, I knew they wanted me gone and singing a
Swan song but I decided to let 'em wait2Embed
Good morning nana, what's for breakfast?
Orange juice, scrambled eggs and some jelly bread
An Oscar Mayer bacon, that's a king's meal
At least compared to my friends that are really fed
You really know how to kill it with a black skillet
Energized by your love and these cats feel it
Not to be rude but my dude want a plate of food
You never exclude, that puts you in a greater mood
To give one of my dudes a little something to eat
So they stomach won't growl when they up in the street
The sounds of a bear, but this time a year
It's kind of cold so we home and we upping the heat
Project radiator hissing like a rattle snake
I'm in the front room playing my favorite battle tape
You in the back room watching Barbany Jones
These white folks living good and we trying to be clones
The ones you work for out in Bensonhurst
After Howard Beach, now the tension is worse
Watching over they kids while they earn a wage
Making 'em lunch, reading 'em books, now turn the page
I was only 10, I was younger then
Guess it must have been hard for me to understand it
House keys hanging on a string from my neck
Had to let myself in, make myself a sandwich, damn

Happy Thanksgiving, sweet potato pies
They was try'na ketchup on it like a plate of fries

Uncle Marvin on the couch watching the game next to me
Talking smack, messing with me like an evil twin
It's the Playoffs and we just try to see who's in
Dallas bout to do it yet again
Number 31 breaks a long run and the Eagles win
Thank God, dinner's ready, this stuff is terrific
Family eats, family talks but nothing specific
No religion, no politics
Pudgy lemon at the table doing a couple politrics
I'm a teen now, the streets are mean now
High praise for the waste, you cook and clean wow
Let it be known you get paid but you're not a maid
Nana's here, family's home and I'm not afraid, nah

Stick 'em up, bang bang, everybody gang bang

Give it up, put it down, turn around, on the ground

Give it up, put it down, turn around, on the ground
Yves Saint-Laurent frames, give me your chain man

The bus stopped over there, near Vanderveer
A bad block and the whole flock was standing there
On the corner, hanging like a chandelier
A bunch of lions and we felt like a band of deer
With no antlers, bunch of sitting ducks
Everyday after school somebody getting stuck
And it always cause sort of a fuss
Then they ran across the street and they boarded the bus
A pack of wolves, pack of tools we hopefully won't have to use
But will if needed to, we a distinguished group of schemers
All we want is a chain or two, if you got the latest Gucc
You already know what we came to do
Dude hiding his Ewings, we ain't into taking shoes
All lies, you will be alright, just obey the rules
Stay down or lay down, just relax
And take off the butter leather or I melt you, facts

In these days got to watch your back
Cause you never can tell how some people act
This world is so cold, seems the love is all gone
You wanna let go but you got to hold on
Ghetto life plaques, police is on attack
No metal where you going, no metal where you at
This world is so cold got to keep the steel close
Cause you never really know when you let the shots go

Dude with the Cazal's on, take those and the frown off
Your face right now pa
You wanna look hardcore, I'mma show you the opposite
You are soft, like the quiet storm
I make it rain with the firearm
Will make you Sweat like Keith, pleading inside a song
Will Make It Last Forever like Right and a Wrong Way
Maybe if you cry to moms, she'll console you and even buy you more
All I know is what I got I ain't giving up
So they can sell it, get the money and live it up
In my right coat pocket got a starter pistol
And I'mma pull it on everybody who got an issue
But I hope it don't come to that
This ain't the Olympics and I ain't into running track
But I don't have to play Carl Lewis
Cause they decide to Rob Saul cuz Saul jewish
In these days got to watch your back

Good evening
I would like to welcome family, friends and faculty
To the 1984 commencement ceremony for Sheepshead Bay High School
To the seniors I want to say: "congratulations"
I know today feels like the end of of a long journey
But it's actually only the beginning
Today is the first day of the rest of your lives

My moms said: "you looked great in your cap and gown"
Life's daring me to fight but I ain't backing down
I got travel plans in minivans and caravans
And 747's but I'll still be coming back around
And while I'm out there, can't act a clown
I won't be on the block, so I don't have to frown
Man, the world so beautiful and colorful
It a be a shame if I only saw black and brown
So I look at my horizons and broaden them
It's so surprising or according to them
I should be dead or incarcerated
Or strung out, but I've come out and of course I made it
Yeah, despite all the naysayers
I just leave it up to God when i say prayers
From this day forward I will vow
To always cut through the bullshit like cake layers
And rise above it all, way above it all
Life can be a mix bad, I gotta love it all
That's what they told me at the podium
Don't let them ever hold you like imodium
Stay loose, be ready when your time come
Stay alert, be ready when the sign come
'Cause you don't wanna miss your calling
Stay in tune while the balloons are in the midst of falling

Please listen to this little caveat
"One day you will have to piss and won't have a pot
But there may come a day when you have a lot"
Whoever don't support you when you young
When you grown they may try to check you out like the Marriott
It's up to you if you hold a grudge
To me, it's like water off a duck's back
My mentality is fuck that
Without them I was still gone get off like I know the judge
And I am not the one that sold the drugs
Me and that life is no correlation
I got accepted to a university
They probably cursing me, but this is my coronation

Elevate educate the way the way the elements should
I eliminate embarrassments eliquently
Elusive ivy league you elfs is elementary
I got the answers you ain't gotta ask who got 'em?
I attract like a ass in some Apple Bottoms
Grab a throttle accelerate, grab a bottle
Cause the average asshole can't bag a model
Now alleviate your anger with some alcohol
Go back to booze and academics out the mall
Get apprehended one August afternoon
Do ten months then come back after June

Yeah! The A&E emblem is embedded
Establish a new economy never end dead it
Ed O's the MC, Rich is the engineer
Endless endeavors that could end your career


Aiyyo, I used to drive a Audi and a Astro van
Now I want a Aston Martin, nigga that's the plan
Acura's and Altima's are average cars
I want that A-RAB Money like Abdul-Jabbar, c'mon

Yo, my embargo can get you all licked like an envelope
Married to the game, then elope
You eager for my involvement
Kill you rappers, while Ace is the emballment
You sound asinine braggin 'bout the ass you got
Back up, give me some space like an astronaut
And assume my associates, the accurate shot
Aims at the oblongata and the back of the knot
BLOAW!

Yo, it's evident your events are promotional
And your employees is way too emotional
You don't wanna engage us and stage us
It's dangerous, then you rappers become endangered
I'm eco-friendly, Ace is addicted to detail
Smoke you like emphysema, send it in an e-mail
What I embody you ALL should embrace
A&E, E&A, Edo and Ace, nigga


YEAH!
You are now tuned in to.. A&E!
Ace & Ed
HEY! H-HEY!
The Dynamic Duo
Arts & Entertainment
Don't change the channel
Don't touch that dail
YeahEmbed

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.....one two, we ain't gotta spit sixteens on this

Aiyyo this the best thing that ever happened to rap
Since Big Pun was packin' a mac in the back of the Ac'
It's like gettin pulled over by police
With a loaded mag and duffle bag of crack in the back
Y'all in hot water, y'all crab motherfuckers it got too hot
In the pot ya got slaughtered
Your manager got sorted you got shorted
We turned around and put it out the blocks bought it

Yo, I got rhymes and gats that I'm concealin
If rap is the floor, hip-hop is the ceiling
Led from jump, never was we trailin
Before you fight me, you better fight the feelin, nigga
Face it god, the base is broad
Edo is grimey, Ace is hard (PAUSE)
You can catch two Ls' like your name's James Todd
A & E, off, en garde, the hit squad

Yo y'all dudes is similiar to cinema
Trained actors like Brad and Jennifer
But yo I got a flow like Angelina
And I'm a king like Billie Jean, promoter Don and Regina
We've been doin this as long as y'all been alive
So little boys keep your mouth shut when the men arrive
I look mean as a motherfucker when I drive
The chromed out black four fifty like ten to five
You might also like
You'll get bodied hard, so you better have a bodyguard
I get that green like Swiss chard
When the flames pop, you'll never gain props
When the game stops, and the chain pops
We gettin off at the same stop?
I can understand an ocean by lookin at a raindrop
We EVERYWHERE, you in a same spot
I'mma make it so you rappers never EVER namedrop

Yeah your girl's on my wood like a hungry beaver
If she tellin you she home with a fever nigga don't believe her
She on top of me I'm underneath her
Cause your swag is illegal procedure like one receiver
Women hate a grown man with feminine traits
And your body gel, kinda smell like cinnamon grapes
Your shampoo's like Fruit Passion
You the ass in the Louis store, tryin to find some cute fashion

Yo, you a no-show, and you won't blow
The people who know aren't talkin
The people who are talkin, don't know
You a hobo, you'll get ate/eight like ocho
By my vocals, I'm number one
Twist your wig like a cumberbund
This whole industry is troublesome
We pop rappers like bubble gum
Don't confuse A&E with the other ones
Yeah! When It's time to get wild on stage
I can spit eights like Lynn Swann, Alan Paige
Or maybe Randy Moss in his college days
When he was goin through that childish phase
But listen, what you witnessin is violent rage
Kind of like a lion that got out his cage
It's the underground sound that pays
Me and Crazy Eddie go together like Brown and Beige

The game a soap opera, "The Days of Our Lives"
Rappers talk shit, then they apoligize ("I'm sorry!")
No substance, hollow guys
That's why I do my 1-2 and don't follow lies
I'm wax, you Serato guys
You bullshit, and Edo is bonafied
My dogs sick 'em, get 'em, now they play victim
Ain't about them toys, it's about who playin wit 'em2Embed
(This magic moment!) Yeah man but yo, I'm sayin man we got to
We got to, we got to do somethin man just to
You know show them people out there man that's coppin them thangs man
You know that we appreciate man like a little song or somethin man
We gotta do somethin man, know what I'm sayin we gotta get somethin down
Or somethin you know real quick, You nah mean, aight man! get on it God!

I love you cause you loyal
I love you for the fact that you even got my back when I touch foreign soil (WOO!)
No matter what the city, state or the county
The thing that keeps me goin is the fact that you want me
I get all your emails and MySpace chats
I tried to deny it but I gotta face facts
You hold me down when them others ain't around
Fairweather friends, love whoever wins
Even though I never sold as much as Nasir Jones
You still support me like a brassiere
You show a lot of love to this inner-city dude
Even on them days when I'm in a shitty mood
Now that's understandin
I try to spend a little extra time when I can when you not so demandin
Send it all back what I'm about to do
Cause this song goes out to you, the fans

Large Professor, your road dog
I roll in smog, sleet and hail to see that we prevail
Over this nonsense this world be bringin us
Still bangin cuts after these years ain't enough
We stay in touch all the time y'all
Like a fire alarm so harm, can't get the best of us
Rightin what's wrong
I'mma be there, prepared to physically tear
Down to the ground, we hit the stage tryin to put it down
Whatever, whenever, we sure to stick the chest out
In honor of yours and when the rest get doubt
Stand strong for whoever try to steps that route
Get burned to a crisp with just a flick of a wrist
We resuscitate the modern-day state of this game
Can't disclaim the fact we been at it, remain
What it is, what it gon' be
Knew that we's gon' see the day
To hear the crowd yell and said yay!
The fans

Entertainin could be drainin
I'm so praisin, blatant, with this picture that I'm paintin
It's for the fans, all audiences
In the seats or the stands, Air Forces or in Vans
From skateboarders to urban and the city supporters
When we on the road crossin boarders
Airports, passports
This ain't a credit card game, rap is a cash sport
Haters stand clear, genuine love with no fanfare
Handshakes, and hugs here
It's independent, we don't search labels
Signin autographs, picture takin at ther merch table
You never swayed left or right, we stood stable
That's why I gave you my all, never tried to play you
We don't neglect the fans
Edo G, Masta Ace, Extra P, really respect the fans


For my peoples worldwide! All ghettos! All levels! Yeah! It's for the fans!Embed
Yea...
One, two, check us out yo..
Fantastic, Spinna waddup?

Yeah, we come from everywhere - Brooklyn, New York
Boston, L.I., everywhere you walk
We put it on the line with intensive rhymes
Everytime a DJ put his hands on a Numark
And cut it up like "..like this"
Don't take your eyes off the team, you might miss
Righteous hip-hop done with a slight twist
Hand in the air, leather glove in the right fist (c'mon)
Y'all don't understand who's up in the building
One day, you'll comprehend but until then
Keep it par for the course (fresh)
I know you dreamin 'bout +Big Things Poppin'+ out of job with a boss
But rap's a fairy tale that'll put you to sleep
I ain't 'bout what you can cop, it's 'bout what you can keep
Lauryn Hill told me that shit and it's so true
And rap life, these be the things that we go through
One two...

Yo, I'm just tryna live

And show initative, but some choose to try
To make me lose my step, turnin off my light
But I use my ear, nose and hands
To command me through the night, IT'S IN MY HEART TO FIGHT
But baby it's time to move on
Passin off my pen like passin off batons
The game is SO cold and bitter
Treat ya like ya name was SO old and litter on the pavement
Like if I should be stuck, then one era away
While you act like you don't surf and don't care where the wave went
Sleep on us if you want to, we'll be giving you NIGHTMARES FO' SURE!
And even when you wake, your thoughts you caught our break
From the dream, nigga - we'll be RIGHT THERE FO' SURE!

YO!!! Apparently, y'all dudes is just a parody
No clarity for popularity, stop comparin me
Similarities, is a rarity
Cause poverty been preparin me for prosperity (Yeah)
F the sparities I know ya hearin me, apart
Never tearin me I'm a man with family
See I never wanna shoot ya
Diggin up the past only muddies up the future
So we chew emcees like Bazooka
And watch 'em get smoked like a hookah
Rap's like Bush, full of Bull
Give and take, ying and yang, push and pull
We get on stage, and act a fool
Easy to get angry, but harder, to keep your cool
We got winners
Ace, Edo, Plug One, and DJ Spinna
It's for the classic old heads and new beginners
True rap not you pretenders

Here I go (Uh huh) A (Yeah) Gain (Here we go) (*Here we go!)

Yo! This track really reminds me
Of when I got my deal in 1990
Moms wasn't behind me didn't take too kindly
I had to find me so I came in blindly
Got a contract to buy me
Ted got the demo hade Mercury sign me
Hip Hop became a part of
I Got To Have It, Bug-A-Boo, Be A Father
See I went for mine, next album Roxbury 02119
Yeah! It didn't sell as well
People started sayin they could tell I fell
Third album was comin out sloppy
All of a sudden, Mercury dropped me
It felt like my world ended
Until I found the blessings of independence
Life could bust your bubble
It's a everyday grind and a constant struggle
Bam! I got hit with the target
With Masta Ace, a new project, here I go
 (DJ Scratching)
Here I go, a-gain! (Here we go!)

Been on a road to success from the very beginning
Saw everyone around me was steadily winnin
I was in the driver's seat, but I lost control
Now it's time to take a shit or get up off the bowl
I mean the mortage due, tuition from my daughter's school
Gotta be in before August 2
I still wanna fight, but it don't seem right
It's like, why wage ya battle when the war is through?
I know where I'm goin but that place is far
Kinda feel like the dog tryna chase the car
No matter how fast I run, I'll never catch it
And that reality I gotta face tommorow
Most times I feel like, "What is the use?"
I got a good mind, I should put it to use
My transit score was the open proof
But I don't wanna be the man in the token booth
Or the man sayin, "Watch the, closing doors"
And give up his live full of shows and tours
I know a lotta niggas sellin real estate
But if I did, then I wouldn't really feel as great
This time truly I'm torn
Cause my wife want that brand new Louis Vutton
And I just got a call, to do anohter show
Damn, once again, here I go
 (DJ Scratching)
Here I go, a-gain! (Here we go!)

I've been doin this since I was a little girl
This music thing it's like my whole world
It's what I love fo' sure
But it's so damn hard to kick down them doors
But I HUSTLE! Cause I want it, gotta STRUGGLE if you want it
Cause can't nobody keep my man down
My passion gonna keep me around
Ridin, tourin, studio, anything to keep my mind flow so

Here I go (HEEREEE!!!!) a-gain! (Here I go!!!)

Heey yeaah
Here we gooooo-wooo...
Gotta keep fightiiin, cause we grindiiiin

Battlin ain't new, since the beginnin it's been war
Y'all rappers know what it is, when it comes to the spittin biz
Since y'all was sittin' pickin' your boogers I was gettin' biz
Now it's all these different kids, itchin to bust
Listen to us, listen to them, tell me what the difference is

Yo! A beast that shows a beast that's tourin
First man in space, like Yuri Gagarin
Surely determined, dirnk my beans without hurlin
Like a German from Berlin pissin on rappers with my drunk urine
Head knock, size spurlin
Dudes start trippin, we take 'em on a whirlwind
Put in work, never show you that we lazy
Don't tell me you pregnant, trick show me the baby, Let's Go!!!!

Between us and the whole congregation
I mean, every cat that EVER tried to rap, the whole rhymin nation

Most of these faulty rappers bound to fail
Not Edo, I'm a alpha male
You tell the story, but you only yellin half the tale
Got a wife, I ain't after tail
Think different on a larger scale
Any shark-infested waters, I'm a killer whale
(BO BO BO BO!) That set sail on land, I already laid the trail
We ain't afraid to dream

Hundred Dollar bill tattoo, on yo thigh
The gleam in ya eye for the cream and the pie
Skirt ridin' high so they can see ya thong better

We was little, we was friends, we rode our big wheels
Now I see you gettin' a Benz with big wheels
All these guys in the city, see is the size of your titties
And that you got hazel eyes and you're pretty
They see a girl like you and they wanna get in her
I was thinkin' we can go to a movie, maybe dinner
You turned around and told me I need to retire
If I can't "show you the money" like Jerry McGuire

You don't care about me, you don't really know me
My broked hearts and dreams is killin' me slowly
Get ahead bitch, walk with a switch
Lip gloss lips and 34 inch hips
Airbrushed chips and chromed out whips
I like to take trips when wife stash the whips
Fuck love 'em, solo
Raisin' my seeds for dolo
And mindstate fresh, with nothin' less than Polo


Please don't be sympathetic
Shit I don't regret it
While these hoes half-stepped it
Nigga I'm gonna rep it, til' I die
And make these G's multiply
I'mma make G's cry like when Jesus died
And on the third day my G rose again
A foul type chick, quick to fuck ya best friend
And smile in ya face, niggas stay in ya place
Catch my head at his waist, lie with a straight face
I know my man had you in the Bricks, with a couple of chicks
Drivin' around havin' endless kicks in the Benz 6
He said the sex was (good), the head was (good)
Yo I think he would tell the whole hood if he could

If ya chillin' in the club, pump it like this
If ya chillin' in ya mansion, pump it like this
If ya puffin' on trees, pump it like this
If ya sippin' on sizerp, pump it like this
What? Pump it like what? Hey pump it like what, like
Makes no sense just standin' around
Pump yo fist, jump up and down
Makes no sense just standin' around
Pump yo fist, jump up and down
Mashed by the sounds of the M to the A y'all

And I don't understand, why
Yes, you are now rockin' with the best

Stop playin', blow it up now, it's ya birthday... (fades out)1Embed

I'm sayin though right after the shows over
Tour bus is outside, matter a fact
This club gotta bathroom and a basement
Whatever, I'll have ya know
(Wordsworth)
I will be delighted to fuck you
Outside, vocal booth, plane, train, automobile or even in the lunch room
Once the period in your private area dries
We could fuck on your kitchen counter like American Pie
Where I had to keep the sperm muzzle (uh huh)
I grab your head while you're giving it
Like I'm bangin it against the turnbuckle
It's my boys turn to fuck you
There is 8 of them, and you gotta mouth to help
So they could take turns in couples
(Masta Ace)
1, 2 aiiyo 1, 2 Check it
Masta Ace, Punchin' Words on the same record
Ladies in the place all I need is a second
A small conversation, before we both naked
And if ya come back to the hotel, I won't go tell I promise
I like to swing my bat like Frank Thomas
And if ya let me get to third base when we alone
Theres a good chance I'm gonna try to steal home
Sorry!!

My games tight when I'm twistin these hoes I dont play
Fuck raw, I keep a hat on like Cool J
I take short strokes to make the sex last
Till they scream "go deep" like they throwin a long pass
You get long dick no cash, pure game
When we fuck, your face wrinkle up like a Shar Pei
Everyday all day, sex you love it
Are you the type of freak chick that like to fuck in public?

 Waterbeds, Hottubs -- Yeah I like that
 Hot sex on the platter -- Yeah I like that

Yo, I can fuck from the Morris Day to the Gladys Knight
Have a threesome, with me, my girl and a baddest dike
And not no Ellen DeGeneres, manish type
I'm talking about a Jennifer Lopez, Spanish type
Don't be afraid of the sex capade
Black cats that get fuck, white cats that get laid
You better eat your wheaties, and just rest up
Just incase somebody call you and say "let's fuck"
(Punchline)
I take them (?) your dressed up, sober or X'ed up
Leave chicks fatigue, they gotta rest up
It's messed up, I fuck till I'm burnt out
Forget the hair salon, I'm a sweat your perm out
I'm the type to book a hotel room with 5 dikes
And get pussy like everyday's my prom night
Punch always rose with a proper squad
And my hoes stop traffic like crossing guards
(Wordsworth)
You a stranger so don't expect sex for fertility
But I'll fuck you and help you collect disability
18 and over bend your knees to your shoulders
And hurt your bladder, and make it hard for you to pee when you older
On your knees folded, don't need Trojans
Deep throat till my scrotum not showin' and your teeth's broken
It don't matter silcon or real breast
You ain't good with fellatio
Watch HBO's Real Sex
(Hook)

"Okay Ace, one last question before we wrap this one up is:
Considering how long you've been in the game, all the places you been
And all the songs that you've done and all the cats you've worked with
Is there anything that you'd do differently?
What I mean to say is, do you have any regrets?"

If I never recorded another song
If I was wrong, and nothin' I spitted was ever strong (No Regrets)
If I never perform at another venue
If this genuine love doesn't continue (No Regrets)
If none of my records was ever sold
If I fold, and never see platinum or even gold (No Regrets)
If no one ever again can recall, if I stalled
And start workin' part time at the mall (No Regrets)
If theres no more shows for be to dabble in
No more travelin', even the show in Maryland
If none of my songs that ever been never spin
In heavy rotation ever again (No Regrets)
If I don't do a song to insight millions
Or get a video done by Hype Williams
If theres never a chance again to be seen
On the pages inside of another magazine (No Regrets)
If the luxuries in life I can't of course afford
If I never win a Billboard or a Source award
I wouldn't want ya pity or ya sympathy
Even if Marley never put me on The Symphony
But I gotta admit it I'm glad he did it
Its considered the first verse I ever spitted
I realize that I'm still apart of history
I learned the key to victory, its not a mystery
You see I got alotta love for what I do in life
And after this then I'mma find somethin' new in life
I guarantee it will be somthin' that I really love
I give thanks for my life to God up above
That I'm blessed to have a job that I enjoy doin'
And now as a man doin' what I was a boy doin'
The only difference is now I get to eat from it
I never thought I would be known on the street from it
But if not one fan that shows gratitude
And when they see me they walk by with an attitude (No Regrets)
It was still an enjoyable ride
Yeah, big up to Kane, Biz Mark and The Pharcyde
And of course to all of my past label mates
Hope Y'all keep on risin' like the cable rates
Ay yo, Premier and Guru, this goes out to you
Special Ed and Buckshot, this a shout to you
I don't know if its the end but yo it might be
Big up to Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed and Spike Lee
And everybody in the game I ever worked with
And all the chicks up in the game I used to flirt with
But if I never get another piece of show coochie
Don't see no Louie Vuitton or no Gucci (No Regrets)
No more suede and linen or designer denim
No more Jeeps with 1,000 watt systems in 'em (No Regrets)
No more sittin' on chrome with them Parelli shoes
No more gettin' my name up in the daily news (No Regrets)
No more Lexus, Coups, Beamers and Benzes
No more Cardiae frames with colored lenses (No Regrets)
No more chains and bracelets, and no baguettes
For what its worth yo, I got no regrets (No Regrets)

Let's take a walk through the deepest part of the hood
I wanna know who it was that said it was "all good"
He musta never been to the corner
And spent the half an hour, or longer
Where you could smell reality stronger
Where they sell you grease in a box and hope that you die quicker
And if you're old enough to walk to the store, you can buy liquor
Where you can find a dice game at any time of the night
And somebody gets shot or stabbed every time there's a fight
Where cats die in the blue sky and the sunlight
And ya bound to get clowned for not holdin ya gun right
By little kids with great game, 'cause they learned to take aim
At a young age, and elude police with a fake name
He's tellin 'em, "I'm Bobby Jackson from 3-B."
When the fact is, he's really Rashawn from 4-D
Hey, this is going out to your hood straight from mine

And ya might see your neighbor down at the corner bodega
Buyin' a malt liquor in exchange for a used Sega
You can even buy your clothes on the block, imagine that
From Versace, to a Coogi sweater wit a matchin' hat
See, this cat's got a big bag of stuff that he just stole
It's the same old routine, but it never gets old
And ya might catch a cab if you live on the right block
From Black Pearl to White Top, yo they might stop
They got a bulletproof partition, 'cause niggas draw heat
But the driver got a bigger one up under the seat

Yeah, big Strick, let's get it on...
Yo, last night I had a nightmare that I was wack
Nope, I'm sorry, it's that you said something dope
Fuck it, it don't matter, cause I know shit ain't really like that
Cause if you said something dope, I know somebody else probably had to write that
You on the wrong song an' I'm on the right track
I hit the cypher, and you bounce talkin' 'bout "Strick, I'll be right back!"
What the fuck you comin' back for?
I pulled up to the front of the club and hurried and scurried up out the back door
Just in time 'fore your ass got a cracked jaw
Mad cause I stack more than what the Lakers sign Shaq for?
Incredible rhymer, what the hell I'mma sell crack for?
I'm real, you a ac-tor, I'm hot, you just not a fac-tor
You on some 'bout to do, I'm on some already done shit
I'll burn you with the same light you just lit up your blunt wit'
And I done came wit' the style you probably 'bout to come wit'
You the opposite of smart feces, get it, dumb shit?
Could give a fuck who you run wit'
Or them niggas you 'bout to go get
Matter of fact, go get 'em, you'll just be layin' on the floor wit' 'em
Lookin' up at me talkin' 'bout: "Why you let the fo-fo hit 'em?
I really don't know these niggas, I just did a show wit' 'em
Went back to the telly and I hit a couple of hoes wit' em
Met 'em at the studio an' just spit a couple of flows wit' 'em
Bought a bag of dro and just sat back and got high wit' 'em"
Oh yeah, that's good to know, now you 'bout to die wit' 'em
Head straight to the pearly gate, say 'hi' to the big guy wit' 'em
Or take it to that other level, down with the devil and fry wit' 'em
Grumble and groan, piss and moan, boo-hoo and cry wit' 'em
At least go home and tell his momma bye bye wit' 'em (bye, momma)
Cause duke, I'm the hottest nigga on earth right now
Ain't bust my gun in nine months 'bout to give birth right now
Run all up in a nigga hood and take his turf right now
Nothing's what your life is worth right now
I've been in shit for too long, it's about time I burst
A & R's ready to quit cause they ain't find me first
Record labels ready to shut down cause they ain't sign me first
But let me stop right now cause I know y'all niggas be dying to rewind my verse

Cause if ya not there's something wrong! (Word is bond)

I came outta rap training camp as the reigning champ
An' lay motherfuckers down just like the pain of a cramp
I won't stop 'til I see my face and my name on a stamp
And y'all still won't be able to stick me or fuck wit' me
I'm 'bout to leave my mark on this game like a buck fifty
Took shots but I duck swiftly, you just missed me
Fuck Alice, Ralph, Ed, Norton and fuck Trixie
I'mma fuck like it's my honeymoon 'til I touch sixty
You ain't a thug so don't try to get tough with me
If you think about tryna hit me, you'll get snuffed quickly
Deep down, hate Bobby Brown, but love Whitney
At times I wish I was O.J. and the glove fit me
Then I wouldn't have to hear none of you wack niggas
Talkin' bout how your crew's rich and you stack figures
In my hand's a chrome gun with a black trigger
I know you think your shit's big, but I packs bigger
Just ask your wife, cause I blasted her pipes
If I tell Strick to pass me a knife would you ask for your life?
You's a pussy, I can tell by your song
Homo/thug rapper, I can tell by your thong
Got sugar in your tank, you probably shit syrup
The world's about to see what it is when I hit Europe
And when I come back home for my birthday
I'mma do another video, too explicit to play
If y'all don't know how we gets it on
From twelve  midnight to the cracks o' dawn
Got girls in the back takin' off they thongs
Then feelin' that something's wrong!
If y'all don't know how we gets it on
From twelve a.m. to the early morn'
If you sitting on things then blow ya horn
Cause if ya not there's something wrong! (Word is bond)

Ace, Zee, yo Strick, Bricks, Zee, Outsidaz, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Niggas fear me like the fear of AIDS
I take out pretty boys wearin' shades
Or thug niggas with they hair in braids (punk)
Then fuck yo' girl through that thing she wearing
Get her pregnant to leave that bitch a single parent
Got mad cars, you probably ain't been in a Jaguar
Drunk at Justin's, while you hang out at a fag bar
Scared of jail, but at home you tryna rob
When you got inside you got sodomized by a lotta guys
Girls pile up in Young Zee room
I fucked the wives of about twenty grooms on they honeymoons
We had a check sellin' bottles of rock
An' so much dope came we remodeled the spot
That’s why all cat spendin' tens, we beat them
See you grinnin' when I stop and the rims keep spinnin'
Fuck with Zee I'll bash ya face
I'll fucks wit' {​*scratches*}​ Masta Ace, bitchEmbed

Nowadays, a range ain't big enough, Moschino ain't jig enough
I'm kind of iced out but my chain ain't thick enough
Album ain't hot enough, label said it's not enough
Singing in the hook, I need to change my look
My rims ain't big enough, chrome don't shine enough
I shopped Fifth Fab, but I still can't find enough
Iceberg to swerve, don't dress gay enough
No airplay so I guess I ain't pay enough
Cristale don't cost enough, and I still ain't lost enough
Money on these chickens that said I don't floss enough
Album barely gold, guess I ain't try enough
Video wasn't fly enough, budget wasn't high enough
And I ain't lie enough about crack sales and jails
Y'all feeling me like braille, well I still got no sales
Must ain't sold enough, cause my heart ain't cold enough
Said I was "Born 2 Roll", they said I ain't roll enough
Guess I got to brag more, must don't boast enough
Ain't New York enough, ain't West Coast enough
But that's fine cause I'mma focus on mine
I'm hoping that 2009 is enough time
Wrote enough rhymes to be on album number fifty
You'll see how I'm on it, if you hung enough with me
The rap game's a book, and I've read mad chapters
And if you ask me, it ain't enough mad rappers

Looking nice in high price, niggas is nuff shiest
Guess it ain't enough thugs, enough drugs on the streets
And niggas ain't busting enough slugs
Not enough Caucasians, know what stress is
Project girls rock vests, not dresses
Enough lessons learned, play with fire get burned
Enough dough get made, none of it earned
Enough wilding, fuck that yo, enough smiling
I rep Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island
Queens plus the BX, not enough Tecs
Not enough cops, killing us all for paychecks


Enough of this, enough of that, enough crap
Enough wack radio stations said enough rap
And they got the nerve to try to flaunt it
Will my album get enough buzz if there's enough niggas on it
When we in the house, it's like its haunted
We got you shook, mad niggas from the Brook', look
Enough cats crack Mo's and mack hoes
Enough cats with wack flows pack shows
Enough of these, enough of those, it never slows
It just grows, your girl don't wear enough clothes
These no-brainers are lost entertainers
Get found on Billboard's greatest sale gainers
Enough Beems and Benz, enough fly honies with dime friends
That want to juice you for your ends
It's getting rough, whole lot of intricate stuff
Mad crime dog, like McGruff, enough's enough

Man, I was starting to think I wasn't never getting out of here
But, umm, I'ma do things different this time, believe me
I ain't never tryna come back here again

Aye, that's what they all say
You'll be back, they always come back
We'll save a cell for you, too

Crazy, fuck that, you ain't gon' never see my ass again
Mark my words - this time? I'm staying out
Y'all waited too long for this
Y'all waited too long for this
Y'all waited too long for this
Y'all waited too long for this

Ayo, it's been a long time just like sweet revenge
Never thought that I'd be seen on these streets again
It's been five years at least, waiting for a peace
Bouncing off of these walls, awaiting my release
Pacing like a caged lion with rage crying
All them days trying to engage with the iron
Stuck in between a rock and a hard place
I got down on my knees, looked into God's face
It's really not the same, is it? With low digits
And y'all ain't hold me down, ain't paid me no visits
New cats claiming shit just like they bought stock
And y'all let em move in and take over the block
I heard y'all be out there spending dubs with 'em
Out all night long, going to clubs with 'em
I guess that's what I get for having a kind heart
Today's when they life end and mine start, uh

Sometimes waking up is even kinda scary

Slipped the Mickey when they first gave me sex
Addicted to the trees, Hennessys and cigarettes
Inhaling the toxic gases when I breathe
Study words of higher deity, 'cause him, I believe
I don't pray on my knees
Just in case the evils come like Ds
I'll be ready to blast and make them bleed
In high double-digits, I go back to the essence
Leave my rhymes behind so you can use 'em for lessons
Like a new Revelations chapter
You ain't moving slow, it's just that in my mind, I'm moving faster
Sick messiah like I'm David Koresh
You done picked the wrong nigga to test
Now pick the tre pound or the TEC
Y'all waited too long for this

I will never forget the day that we first met
I wasn't even feeling you then, but worse yet
I was all up in the mix with one of your friends
And when you seen us you would always give me one of your grins
Like if I only knew what I was missing
I would quit kissing on this chick and change my position
I really thought you and my man was a better match
I never thought you was the type that I could catch
I used to see you out in the park with different cats
Them Big Willie types that rocked them pimp hats
Had every other guy on the block trying to get you
Wishing that they had that rap to get with you
Felt you was out of my league
It's like if you was silk and linen, then I was fatigue
I never would have pictured you and me together
But it's like the way I hold you we was meant to be together, come on

Now I spend most of my time just being with you
Early on, I was afraid to be seen with you
'Cause I knew cats would do anything they could
To stop us from being together, it's all good
They was mad 'cause I got you and they didn't
Some even tried to approach me, I'm not kidding
Had to be ten times I got into a fight
With niggas tryin' to say I wasn't hitting it right
Yup, they kept on hating, just kept on waiting
Hoping that we'd break up but we kept dating
Never knew it'd be so hard to be with you
I should make it easy on myself and just quit you
(Make it easy on yourself) I need to make it easy on myself
Yup, I need to make it easy on myself
(Make it easy on yourself) Yup, I need to make it easy on myself
Yup, and just leave you alone (No, wait)
No, wait, when I hold you, it feels so great
I realize and recognize that you my soulmate
It's us forever, had to let you know
Just like I told you, I'ma hold you, never let you go, come on
The way I hold you, it feels so good
I don't ever wanna let you go
Can't see you with nobody else
I just really had to let you know
It's the way I hold you

It's the way I hold you (One, two, check it)

You should have known from way back I tried to amp you
Tried to speak on your skills when other niggas felt me
But you know that if you wasn't with me, they can't even hear you right
And if you tried to snatch me up, it'd probably turn into a fight (Uh-huh)
I been through my phases with cats and chicks
I know you seen me chilling with fake players
Who tried to grab me in the club and dance with me on the stage in gators (Wack)
They say you just hating, you jelly off the money that they making
Peep the stripper broads, thugs and gods and punks
Cats would front, get me high with all the smoke from the blunts
It's not love, it's just lust
They always put me down when shit gets rough
I can't do it alone, I need someone to hold me right, tell me their feelings
Speak on us to they boys, that's why we dealing (Uh)
Niggas starting rumors like we ain't chilling or split up
When you've been writing poems for me just to shut they lip up
And there's still cats who try to touch me when they spot me alone
Tryin' to tap me just to see if I'm turned on
But it's the way you speak to me, it's like we on the same frequency
And when you hold me, you make peak, come on
The way I hold you, it feels so good

I met her on the corner of Gates and Bedstuy
It was only right that I approached and said hi
'Cause she looked like no other chick I ever saw
She was on her way coming up out the cornerstone
I asked could I carry your bags and walk her home
I can tell she was new in New York just from her tone
'Cause she wasn't that typical rude and ignorant
Teeth-sucking and eye-rolling telling me to leave her alone
We dipped and we yapped, we chit and we chat
About this and that and where she lived at, yeah
This may sound kind of Wu-Tang Clan-ish
But this butter-pecan honey was not Spanish
She lived like three blocks from my man
In New York for six months, moved from Pakistan
Well that explains the strange accent and the strange clothes
And that cute little diamond in your nose
She said, "I gotta wear this gear every Sunday but
You gotta see how I look come Monday" – "Word!?
Meaning I can see you again? Maybe
Give you a call, take you out on the weekend"
She winked at me and kind of laughed
Ripped a piece of the grocery bag and wrote her math
You can bet your last damn dollar
That I'ma give you a call, Brooklyn Masala

"Mentally and sexual - can't forget how I met you"
"And every time I look at you
I see the most wonderful woman I have ever met"

Can we walk and talk, share our worlds
I'm feeling you a whole lot more than most girls
If you give me the number I'll holler
I wanna see you again Brooklyn Masala

On our first date, knocked on the door around eight
When she came down she smelled good and looked great
She had the tight Frankie B's on, white on white Ones
A pink bubble goose and pink bubblegum, I'm like, damn
Even pink Chanel shades
Her long black hair was done up in box braids
She didn't have the Maybeline face, that was all dead
Instead she had a red dot on her forehead
C-cup's pumping, looking real ill
"You wanna see Lord of the Rings or Kill Bill?"
She looked at me and said, "either one
'Cause there really ain't no Black stars in either one"
"So what you wanna do girl?"
She kind of blushed then
We settled on dinner for two at Justin's
The food was good with no surprises
We had the barbecue shrimp as appetizers
We had the cat fish main course
A few drinks, then out the front door like Main Source
We stepped out into the big city
She said, "the Times Square lights are so pretty"
We caught a cab, back to the lab
Stopped kissing long enough to pay the tab
She said, "I think we got a nice future"
That night learned all about the Kama Sutra, my Masala
Can we walk and talk, share our worlds
I'm feeling you a whole lot more than most girls
If you give me the number I'll holler
I wanna see you again Brooklyn Masala
B to the (B to the) K to the (K to the)

Think I'm starting to feel you, just wanna let you know
One day you'll be mine and I just won't let you go
You feeling me, I'm feeling you
You feeling me, I'm feeling you
Might be falling in love but I'm tryna take it slow (my Masala)

Thank you madame for this fascinating lesson in our cultural differences4Embed
Yo, this joint right here is dedicated to all them grimy cats

Lurkin and waitin to see who's car was parked
It ain't your chick so why you care for?
Why you stop and stare for, what you there for?
Do you need to know every single, thing about my life?
It's not enough that I rap and sing about my life?
Even when I'm sleep, you got nothin else to do
But call up your man who's a bitch nigga just like you
Talkin 'bout my business like it ain't nothin
Y'all have a two hour discussion on who I might be fuckin
Cats with these feminine ways and traits
Just one example of the type of niggas I hate, c'mon

Come around here actin all fake
These are the type of niggas we hate

I hate them niggas who just kiss ass
So they can move up in the game like quick fast and they get gassed
Now they walkin 'round like they so down
Cause they workin up at Motown, but slow down nigga
Y'all motherfuckers is the worst kind
And I know you're probably hearin this here for the first time
But I'mma say that shit other rappers just won't say
Think about it, feel it inside but just don't say
Keep them fake hugs when you come in the place
And when I see you I'mma say this directly into your face
Y'all some fake niggas, except now you got a name
And this applies to half of these niggas up in this game
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I had to get a pen and just write this shit down, c'mon
You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do

These are the type of niggas we hate
They smile in your face you think they are friends
They flip and they never be the same again
Come around here actin all fake
These are the type of niggas we hate

I hate bitches that be frontin like they got your back
But when the jump off crack you see its not like that
Certain chicks put the "S" in snake
Try to give a bitch a break, wanna test your weight
Let 'em stay in your crib, even take your whip
Might even babysit while they playin the strip
Kinda chick want to smile up and call you sis'
Can't even bring your man around shorty (tsk, tsk)
Call your moms mom, even wear your clothes
Thats why I gotta give it up to them honest hoes
You know what they about from the gate
Stay in there place, here's another type of broad I hate (What type?)
Type to put all of your business in the street (uh-huh)
That's why I only got a handful of peeps
Closely analyze all the new ones I meet
2001 bitches I ain't too beat
There you have it
Just a few of examples
And if you can't relate to this shit right here
Chances are you're the type of motherfuckers we're talkin about
Ya heard?

You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you
Never seem to get the shit straight

They smile in your face you think they are friends

Check it out yo, 'ey yo
They call me Big Noyd, the one that smack the taste out
Your fucking mouth, I keep it gutter that's what I be about
That's what I breathe, what I eat, that's what I shitted out
I'm from the streets and I'm a G and I know nothing else
Like when there's beef I grap a Tec from the fucking shelve
Stuff it in my jeans step on the scene, ruin your health
Snitches run their mouth, that's why I do it myself
No need to co, there's noone ratting me out
Just to find the guy, I keep it gully nigga ride out
Before my thuns come and air out your hide out
Matter fact say no more, your raw to grap your four
Your scared to call your dog, nigga let's get it on

Winking to your front door, who you know as raw as me
A skinny nigga, but up on the streets I'm a beast, motherfucker

Yeah, yeah, this is how we do it man
We busting them chrome nines and running from one time
This is how we do it man

Hope I don't get shot today
Cause I heard some niggas letting off rounds, like a block away
It's like walking through Vietnam
Sorrounded by americans dressed like the Viet Cong
See that kid, 16, try to cop a gat
Ever since he was a brat he been a copy-cat
And he ain't scared to pull it blood
So I better watch my step or I might catch a bullet slug
See there's all kinds of rival stuff
We all in the line of fire nigga, and survival's tough
Send my son to the store, cause there's mold on the bread
They might send him home with a hole in the head
And just like 'Windex Cleaner'
It's clear that niggas settle problems with their index finger
And my moms has yet to strove
Cause she know that folks catches strays like pet control
These are dangerous times, the life's on the line
A nigga might get it by the knife or the nine
I gotta stay awake when I hold the cake
Cause the grim reaper looking for a soul to take
And the next cat may be him
So I look over my shoulder, when I'm standing at the ATM
Ya can go 'head and worry 'bout the crackers, fine
But that nigga with the nine, skin is black as mine
This is how they do it man
Sawed-off shot, screaming give me what you got, nigga
This is how they do it man
Straight off blunt spillers and natural born killers
This is how they do it man
Chrome play the nine, put your life on the line, woaw
This is how they do it man
Holding down the block, the plot just won't stop, no1Embed
Send this one out to everybody, trying to make ends meet
Yeah
I'm on the grind
Still got my money on my mind
And I, feel like I'm walking on the line
When it, seems like I'm running out of time
That's when I'm going on the grind

Ay yo, I'm trying to make my dollars double
I done found a place to fit in
For niggas trying to get into this power struggle
I work hard on the job like immigrants
And always try to get my first half in advance
It sounds strange but the rap game is not a game
You could make a lot of money gain a lot of fame
But don't get it twisted
You could get addicted
Buy a mansion in the Hamptons, and get evicted
Now if you call me and I'm not around
I'm probably putting my grind down
Doing shows out of town
I be the manager, road manager, and call handler
Booking agent, choreographer and tour planner
I be the V.P. of marketing and promotions
Producer and arranger, with a range of emotions
And after it all, I still gotta perform
At three o'clock in the morn', when half the fans are gone
But it's fine
Been on the grind since like '88 or '89
The game is foul like a plate of swine
Now is there anybody kind like me?
Is anybody out there on the grind like me?
For everybody working nine to five
For everybody trying to rise with they eyes on the prize
I'm with 'cha, we all going through it
But yo, deep down inside I know we still gon' do it
Oh

Yeah
I really feel I'm blessed cause I was born with a talent to rhyme
But the stress got me this close to quitting sometimes
On the crowded A train every morning
I can't wait for the day
My hustle game don't got to start this way
Niggas think it's all good when they see me and hear my CD
And think I'm jumping in the 745 with TVs
They don't know I miss tours and shows
To go to work and pay bills and keep dough on my clothes
In the shadow of a legend so
They expect me to spit and sound like him
But y'all need to let it go
Everyday I face the crossroad of rap or drugs
Album cuts and singles and crack heads and clappin' thugs
When I'm broke my moms won't even give me a hug
But on payday I'm her baby then she call it love
I keep making my moves cause one day I'm a prove
I got what it take and I will not lose
Yeah

'New York, Big City of Dreams'
To get by, cats doing plenty of things
It's a honest hustle, but you gotta have some kind of muscle
Either it's that or you sign with Russell
Cause nowadays an average cat can flow decent
So in your spare time you can go to the precinct
Let me introduce you to some cats who won't shoot you
Everyday they spend in the pen is so crucial
They got kids to feed, wives to hug
Their jobs are so strange, their lives are bug
Look, my nigga Al had a store in his trunk
And the place under the dash where he store his pump
He had them white and white 'Air Force Ones' for 40 ($)
And them iddy-biddy-kiddy ones for shorty
He was just trying to survive the recession
Now he's locked up for stolen goods and gun possession
My nigga Neek had them furs for cheap
He bought a two family home, an Excursion Jeep
But word got around he was doing it big
Cops ran up in his crib, now he's doing a bid
Now Jose was making money hand over fist
He had a legitimate job with a little bit of a twist
Besides me and my man, I've known people
He sold stuff too, out of the back of Home Depot
Everything from new tools to kitchen sinks
And he was just trying to get rich it stinks
Cause now he lost his job and his mortgage due
And he can't afford a lawyer, man dog is through, oooh
We were lying on schemes and scams
Just so we could realize our dreams and plans, man
This ain't America is it?
It don't take much for the cops to come pay you a visit
But do what you gotta do, fuck them laws
Life is a test you better up them scores
Listen, I ain't trying to survive, I'm trying to live
And here is some advise I been dying to give
They don't care if you sell it to inner section
Republicans run for office and win election
Who's in the inner section, see my pen erecting
This for my cats that just been effecting
From Brownsville and Watts, it's down steal the spots
It won't stop until we're down killing cops
It's a revolution, you believe in god, or evolution
Either way dog, we need a resolution like Aaliyah
A man got sentenced to a year
And when he get out, it's another street career
It's a vicious cycle
For every kid who ball in the park and wish he Michael
Listen the world don't like you, but
You better keep it moving, you better keep improving
You love my voice, ain't it deep and soothing
I'm saying fuck fame, I'm having a no-name
Platinum and gold chain, and saying
I'mma beat 'em at their own gameYou might also likeEmbed
Woke up this morning hearing shots below my project window
The TV's on from playing all night on Nintendo
Jump out of bed, tryna to see what's up with all the noise and
I see somebody else has caught a case of lead poisonin'
This type of shit around my way's a regular occurrence
Because the same shit just happened to my nigga Terrence
A week later now, somebody else is laying dying
Surrounded by a crowd of people and his momma crying
The way he's laying there, it looks to me like duke's a goner
I seen the cats who just did it run around the corner
I start to wonder who it is and why they had to wet him
I bet I knew him, or at least, I bet I probably met him
I can't pretend that I'm shocked like electrocution
'Cause any night, there could be an execution
My momma told me that that thug shit'll get you buried
The next day, there's your name in the obituary
I asked her, "Why we gotta live in this environment?"
She said, "Your grandfather drank up his retirement
Plus when I fucked around and had you, I was just a baby
Just maybe, if I wasn't being miss lady
Things could've been a little bit better"
Threw on my jeans and my double knit sweater
I hit the block tryna find out who got done in
Who had the gun and who that was I seen running

Another body on the ground, cold; and
Another day, another lost soul; and
Same shit in every zip code
No matter where you go
Its just another block episode
Another story on the street told; and
Another turn down the wrong road; and
Sit back and watch it unfold
Yo, I'll let you know
Just another block episode
Yo, I roam the streets with my peeps and a gun by my crotch
I got beef with this cat that resides on my block
He getting popped - I swear, when I see him, it's on
He'll just be a tattoo on his best friend's arm
My friends screaming, "Punch, be calm"; y'all can save it
He borrowed five Gs two months ago, still ain't pay it
This girl hit me on the cell about his location
I grabbed my gun, jumped in the hoopty, then I started racing
Turned out the lights a block away so he don't peep the caper
I see him and a bunch of cats by the bodega
Don't wanna kill him, I just wanna teach this cat a lesson
Stepped on the gas, grabbed the gun, cocked back the weapon
Shot up the whole corner, but hit him in the kneecap
That's cool, 'cause dead niggas can't pay your cash back
I'm nuttin' to laugh at, I keep a bad temper
I hit him, a bystander, and one of his crewmembers
(gunshot)
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Last thing I heard was a blast, car circling past
I wasn't nervous, thought they might be searching for gas
Soon as Rob came out dispersing the trash
Car sped, and lead went through his windows, curtains and glass
Dove in the dirt and the grass
I look - bullet struck my right arm
Glass in my left palm, I lost my neck charm
I knew it was Punch, 'cause Rob owed him money
But never had it, always got new kicks and gear to match it
I'm in the ambulance, I thought that beef was squashed
That's why when he seen Punch he crossed the street and dodged
See Rob's records with the DA is forfeit
My records 4.0 GPA, going to Harvard
Athlete's a hundred miles and running, he's a convict
Other hand, my high school football team, I lead in yardage
Boys, regardless - blood pressure drop, artery vessel clogs
Cardiac arrest, next my chest was shocked, IV
Oxygen mask, bleeding heavily
We need to get to the hospital fast; I'm doing 70!
Why I gotta be a causality of war? Did good most my life
My career was growing gradually and more
Hearing, "Hold on, you'll be alright, you're gonna make it"
Sirens up ahead, construction on the pavement
Slowed down - from this moment, I didn't have a chance
Seein' hazards flash, can't believe I died in a traffic jam
(*ambulance siren*)6Embed
I'm startin' to think that my skill is a waste
Still in the race with an ice grill on my face
Mad at the world, mad at you, mad at my girl
Mad at my friends and anybody drivin' a Benz
I really hate this nigga that delivers my mail
But if I hit him they gonna send me up the river to jail
I hate my neighbors, they always askin' for late night favors
Hate indie labels, especially hate majors
I don't give a fuck no more, fuck this tour
Fuck these shows and these groupies, they all ho's
Hate these rude people stayin' all in my face
And hate the fact that Visa always callin' my place
So all you mean creditors and magazine editors
Same ones that debted us and put niggas ahead of us
I'm a mad dog who sits in the dark
I'm fixin' the bark watchin' 106 And Park
What a mess, I guess I'm sorta stressed
Turn on the radio and I get more depressed
No wonder I'm kinda bitter
Strick told me I should quit player hating, but fuck that I'm not a quitter
Had a few cats betray me, try to play me
Bail and try to blame me, fuck you pay me
If y'all could, y'all would finish me
That's why this finger here is for everybody in the industry

I'm talkin' to you, and I'm talking to you, and I'm talking to you nigga

Yo I'm simply trying to eat 'til my belly is fat
And I rest in the Midwest where R. Kelly and Nelly be at
Where my name ring bells like "Who's celly is that?"
And "Yo Strick you about to blow!" yo stop telling me that
Cuz at the end of the day I'm still just a nobody
Cuz nobody knows me no record label chose me
But Tommy Boy did and look where that got me
A bad attitude and a reason not to be cocky
A huge debt, three lawyers, and two managers
A bullshit advance that didn't recoup the damages
A couple of singles that wasn't really chartin'
Yo Ace I got a Cherokee! "Bow Wow got an Aston Martin"
That motherfucker got a mansion with a swimming pool
A rec room with many games and plenty women too
He prolly got his own chef and a fuckin' hot tub
I got a truck with four rims but yo they not dubs
Speakin' of nots yo, I'm not a happy camper
Not gettin' no younger, feeling like a grandpa
Yo I got low self esteem
Just like a nigga running in place tryin' to chase his own selfish dream
And fuck my girl, soon I'll be startin' to creep
She's a slob and don't care if her carpet is neat
She got a slick mouth and always gets smart when she speak
And can't cook a lick and the bitch fart in her sleep
I got a dog that don't bark and cat that don't meow
Everybody else is rich and I don't fuckin' see how
Sometimes I wonder why even bother waking up
Should just end it and give back the spot I'm takin' up

Uhh... Beatnuts! Masta Ace

Y'all rap dudes are funny, I don't feud with dummies
I don't need no problems, I need food and money
I recall when we used to fool with honeys
That was cute as bunnies with the smoothest tummies
Now we like Brink's tryin to move this money
Run with cast to Ak-man, rude and crummy
It's the chairman of the board and I'm carryin a sword
I look heavy in a Chevy and I'm scary in a Ford
F-150, you should just run swiftly
Unless you nice, you like it you can just come get me
Y'all dudes sweet like cakes and pies
I go together with rap like shakes and fries
And I hate them guys with hate in their eyes
Hopin we fall, can't wait to rise
Yeah, I'm all natural like a case of Snapple
And don't talk shit cause the Ace'll slap you
And don't try to run cause I'll chase and catch you
Put a sharp blade to your face and scratch you (ouch)
What'chu wan' fuck with a ninja for?
I'm like a cornered rat with a injured paw
And I'll bend your jaw and end your tour

Head twitchin, like an epileptic
You'll get dropped (like what) like elephant shit
I'm from the home of the Yankees
You not feelin that then yank these, I'm sittin on twankies
You goin nowhere fast like a treadmill
Don't make me have to roll up to your crib and meet your parents
Like Ben Still' - you'll get killed
For tryin to be a funny ass (like who) like Ben Hill (ha ha)
I don't, wanna have to run up in your label
And put a hole in ya head like a bagel (blaow!)
From here to Milwaukee
I do it for the kids like Bill Cosby (hey hey hey!)

It's Big Ju the family favorite
You should just place the name on your forehead and staple it
I'm here y'all, I finally made it
Then I can be really cool to talk to when I'm medicated
One of the game's most underrated
I'm makin a hit, then everybody wanna recreate it
Every due that come through I paid it
So now if you bite this, I'm leavin you decapitated
Came to show you niggas I got soul
Me and the music man together bust out of control
It's a feelin that's hard to hold
Look, even if you pregnant it makes you wanna work that pole
Now tell me y'all, what's really good?
Cause everything I'm hearin on the radio is hillbilly hood
It's evident that I clearly should
Put a fuckin foot up your ass to make the shit understood

They got broke people, poor people, my people, your people
(Wherever I go) Listen
And they won't change, ever change, can't change, don't change
(And everyone knows)

As I travel through various towns and strange places
I see the same scowls and frowns on the same faces
The game races and cats try to catch it
Before they know it they know death on a first name basis
Whether it's slangin' or banging, drinking or smokin'
There's bound to be one cat thinkin' of loccin'
The hood's like a sitcom
Leave ya bike outside, come back outside, I guarantee your shit gone
Young cats be sellin' the rock
Money busting out they sock mama tellin' them stop
But desperate times call for desperate means
It all seems so simple when you're just a teen
Only take one bad apple to poison the good
This for the girls on the block, the boys in the hood
And wherever I go it's the same as home

Listen, they got wild and rough blocks where it's hard to trust cops
Get shot on your way to school at the bus stop, damn
That kid was a fine scholar
Hear his mama whine and holler he died for nine dollars
Young mothers trying to learn the ropes
And them one dollar lotto games turn their hopes
They keep hoping that they number coming
They dreamin' about getting rich driving in they hummer dummin'
Old ladies keep they purse in the front
Cuz them fiends on the prowl it's the first of the month
And you still feel good when you there, yup
And you know you in the hood when you there
They got one in every spot on the planet
And if you wasn't raised there you prolly cannot stand it
Some call it the hood I'm calling it home
And there's love feel it all in my poem...what they got?

H dot O dot O dot D
Should I turn my back on the hood? No not me
Whether P.R., D.R., or the West Indies
Or fifty other spots that are just like these
Chicago know what I mean, Philly as well
Shit I hear nowadays sounds silly as hell
Whether in Miami or in Houston, Texas
Where some so broke they're not used to breakfast
Oakland know what I mean, L.A. too
D.C. feel me, I can tell they do
When will it change? Never I know
And I see the same things wherever I go

I'm keepin' 'em locked and the beat knockin'
Hear me comin' with this song that I brung in
Daddy-O told me this when I was still a young'un
"Ain't nothin' like hip hop music
That's why we choose it and the world just can't refuse it"
This shit is underground like a gopher
Show a little love 'fore it's over
You might also like
Give me some of that good ol' love
Ohhhh, let me make you, you
Give me some of that good ol' love
Whoa, ohhh

Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on, let me make you sing
"Gimme that good ol' love"
Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on, let me make you sing

Let me put y'all on like a bulb in the socket
In the club niggas knock it wit' a dub in the pocket
They walk in the store, I love when they cop it
Make you other rappers struggle to top it
But this man flow with the greatest ease
Never did care about the haters, please
He done paid his dues, paid his fees
He done stayed overseas, made his G's
But now I got a wife and she bad as Halle
Her moms is a militant, dad is rowdy
The fans kind of act like they glad I'm outtie
But they prolly sittin' at home sad and pouty
You show me some love, I'mma show it right back
I know a tight track so I throw it like that
My limo driver's white, my attorney black
"Show me some love" like I'm Bernie Mac
Give me some of that good ol' love
Ohhhh, let me make you, you
Give me some of that good ol' love
Whoa, ohhh

Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on, let me make you sing
"Gimme that good ol' love"
Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on, let me make you sing

This is for my Shaolin shooters and my Brooklyn teens
Uptown Bronx and them crooks in Queens
I work like a maid when she cooks and cleans
Cuz it's about to be a wrap from the looks of things
The game is changed, the game is strange
The game is lame and it ain't the same
But that's how it is, you can ask Giz
You can ask Biz, we did it for the kids
Listen here, this is different here
If you got an eye for detail and efficient ear
I won't disappear, I'mma keep on givin'
I'mma keep on livin', I'mma keep bein' driven
I'm down to earth and I'm close to ground
And spit shit better than most around
This how hip hop is supposed to sound
Tear them other cats' posters down now
Give me some of that good ol' love
Ohhhh, let me make you, you
Give me some of that good ol' love
Whoa, ohhh

Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on, let me make you sing
"Gimme that good ol' love"
Got to be the real thing
Something you feel thing
Come on, let me make you sing

Give me some of that good ol' love
Ohhhh, let me make you, you
Give me some of that good ol' love
Whoa, ohhh

Listen
A life in rap's like a knife in the back
This life attracts some of the trifest cats
Niggas getting deals with pipes and bats
If that don't work then they strike with gats
I know a few dudes got label deals
Cause they crew pack steel like Navy S.E.A.L.S
And I ain't too smooth or too cool to mention
I done ran up in the label with cruel intentions
Listen, a label guy's like a bitch in disguise
He just trying to stay alive, see the twitch in his eyes?
A punch and a slap put his lunch in his lap
And a kick to the gut'll put a hunch in his back
No teeth and gummy and now he talk funny
But he set to sign off on that tour support money (that's right)
This nation's built on violent intimidations
Turn cats to hospital patients they more gracious
No promotion? Make 'em float in the ocean
Your album about to flop and he ain't showing emotion
He having a good time with a bunch of his friends
Let him find his dog dead in the trunk of his Benz
And he ignored your memo and the issues on it
Give his ass a bullet with his initials on it
You want a big advance? Don't tell him twice
Hang his ass out the window like Vanilla Ice
See cats get the message when they life on the line
But when you call from the crib with they wife on the line
This country of ours was built on violence
If your ass got in the way you was killed in silence
And these been the ways since back in the days
Just ask the Indians or the African slaves
So before you pick a logo, and choose a name
First you gotta learn the ways of the music game
Yup
You might also like"I need to talk to you right now about my royalties"...
... "My office hours are from 9 to 5"
"Fuck your office hours. I need to talk to you right now motherfucker!"...
... "What are you doing man?"

These are the ways, the ways, the ways, the ways
This is how you got to get down these days
You want to get paid just remember the phrase
These are the ways, the ways, the ways, the ways
("The ways" scratched repeatedly)
These are the ways, the ways, the ways, the ways
Now if you think what I'm saying is a bunch of bull
Run up to the label now and punch a fool
And watch niggas panic and start to run frantic
This goes for Warner, Electra, and Atlantic
And any other major on the map
Or A&R cat who turned his back after he made you want to rap
See if you can find out a face and name
So you know when you roll who to place the blame
But Keith Murray ain't need investigators
He fuck niggas up, ask questions later
And Diddy had a problem with Stevie Stout
Got a Cristal bottle, knocked Stevie out
Damn, he even whip a nigga ass in style
When Suge hears this record man he has to smile
And Def Jam reps wearing vests to work
Cause they don't want they ribs and they chests to hurt
If I worked for them dudes man you won't see me
When Rocafella fall out with O.D.B. (nope)
That be a day that I'm a call out sick
Cause niggas cool first then they fall out quick (that's right)
Keep on thinking that it's only rap
You'll be a broke-ass nigga and a lonely cat
So before you get played out and lose your fame
First you got to learn the ways of the music game
Yes
"What the hell you talking about?"...
... "I'm talking about the cars and the clothes
And I got an even longer list of expenses:
Studio time, promotions, your expense account..."
"You trying to muscle me?"...

Take a look at my eyes
Take a look at my eyes, and tell me what you see
When you look at me, wutuwankno now

I'mma speak to the fans now and answer questions
So there's no room for errors, no chance for guessing
That's the reason why on this track I choose to rap
It's to make sure that none of yall confuse the facts
'Cause no I never moved to Cali
I just had a bitch in Compton and a few in the valley
And "Born to Roll" never went gold or so I'm told
I never did find out how much the shit sold
And no I ain't sore at Marley
Though I rarely ever see him and I call him hardly
And no I never lived in the bridge
But Craig and Shante, did as kids
Straight from the ville had to catch the train
No I never picked a pocket or snatched a chain
I was way too deep in the music
God gave me a gift, I decided to keep it and use it
And no I wasn't dissing Ghost
Before you try to spread beef, you should listen close
I gotta watch what I'm yelling fella
'Cause some fans dumb like Hellen Keller
Nah, label ain't off the ground
But we bound to get y'all niggas open off the sound
Now we ain't got are office yet
But we got big plans like a architect
Take a look

When you look at me, wutuwankno now
Take a look at my life, and tell me what you see
When you look at me, please I gotta go now

What's up M.A
I see the look of concern and fate, it's ya turn to wait
I play the judge, and the jury and adjourn late
See, that tend to happen when you learn hate
Edo left out good, but returned great
And now I'm about to face the city
Plus I got a case with Diddy
For jacking my classic
"I Got to Have It" beat that's so gritty, I'm so witty
And y'all niggas is so pretty
Outside of Boston, people ask me about Benzino
Are we cool, do we got beef, or is we peoples
We could debate on that, but I guess y'all got to wait on that
Now hate on that nigga, and stop stirring up beef
You turning up grief, when you doubt your beliefs
Stay out of grown folk business
We young entrepreneurs that own our own business
I answer questions like a witness
To chop your crew down, with no forgiveness
Take a look in his eyes
He's an angel on the outside, but a crook in disguise
Now take a look

Look here, I gotta go, be fair, I got a show
You here, you kind of slow, oh yeah, you got to know
Well, I do got a lot to tell
And a book 'bout my life got a shot to sell
Yea, them raps 'bout them rise, I was one of the first
But them facts niggas hide like a gun in a purse
Yea I made you put them chromey things on your cars
And yea, I used to hang with some porno stars
Strip clubs on a weekly basis
You used to, see these faces in some freaky places
But all that's behind me, it's not the same
When you reach a certain age, life is not a game
I was in the fast lane, I was out for speed
But now I got more than one mouth to feed
Yea, it used to be all about a hump and a rub
But I ain't tryin' be that old nigga up in the club

Yo

This girl Delilah, struck my nut like Gold Schlager
In Amsterdam my blunts are rolled proper
Bahamas I get platinum pussy but only sold double copper
They Wanna Have Fun like Cyndi Lauper

Wendy Barker
Chick was a friendly stalker
Met her in India in a Fendi parka
Switched the plan, never got to sniff the plant
Cause her dad came home he had a pistol man
So I jumped out the window like a bitch and ran

Switzerland
Suzanne that was with the band
We had sex under the stands where they sit the fans
Unzipped her pants
Rubbed the clit with my hands
Jerked me off 'till her wrists twisted and jammed
I can't wait to get my dick french-kissed in France

Cristol-Ann
Met her in Bristol man
Had a show with Shauwny-T and Mr. Jam
Listen fam, she had a big rack of lamb
And they caused mad problems like math exams
Ask my man, her tits caused traffic jams

Yo, in India
I got an Indian chick named Dirty Red
When I cum I just aim for the dot on the forehead
Legs spread, got this girl Benet in France nice
Won't hit it cause the bitch too big like Kelly Price
Got head in the bathroom before my next flight

Vanessa White
No drawers, dress was tight
And she said she was a dike 'till I sexed her right
Switched her ov', fell for the Masta plan
Touched my balls, swerved and I crashed the van
Had to jump on the train, cost me half a grand
Damn
Amsterdam
Holding a handicam
A tramp named Pam had cramps so she cancelled plans
Hotel Abyss
Next night bedside stripping
Blew her back out had her legs starts twitching
Fucked 'till I caused a blackout in the red light district

Check the next visit
I'm in New Orleans with Bridget
Twisted, I make the pussy fart when I hit it
My L.A. girl is here, drunk off the liquor
She slides down my pole like a Miami stripper
I got mad broads because I'm that nigga


Uh, yo, yo
I got Nina in Vienna
Tina in Sierra
Even Phoebe in Atlanta
Trish and Trina in Savannah
Dede, Kiki, Cece and Tameka in Havannah
Sabrina, Alexandra, Hannah, three in Indiana
Athena and Samantha from Tahiti and they dancers
Genie who was squeezy, did graffiti and a Cancer
While leaving Louisiana gave a CD as a sampler
Was me and me and Tamber
Drove to meet me with her grandma
She's from Alabama
Freaky and be easy in a camper
But I squeeze her
Had a threesome in her Mitsubishi LancerEmbed
At times I don't know who I be
And when I look in the mirror it's like I don't know who I see
Am I even moving at all?
Cause I swear I can't tell if my life is improving at all
Every time I got a pen in my hand
I forget every time before that one has been in my hand
And I write for the moment, get it tight how I want it
Get the right lawyer on it cuz I might wanna own it
I tussle and I fight, I hustle and I write
I struggle every night with every muscle in my mic
I'm in this rap race trying to eat the cheese
But y'all don't know my name like Alicia Keys
My face ain't familiar, neither is my music
If shit don't soon change I be the one to lose it
I drink a little liquor tryin' to heal my nerves
Cause y'all don't listen here and feel my words
But something's wrong with y'all, ain't nuttin' wrong with me
And happy in my life is what I long to be
And happy in my life is what I'm gonna be
What you see in me is what I was born to be
From the day that my moms first birthed a child
She didn't need the world to make it worth the while
So I don't need no magazine to reach the pinnacle
Screw a review and you can eat the interview
Cause that's what y'all seem to tend to do
Them cats you cover all seem identical
Through it all I weave like the Parker's Hair
And shine underground cause it's darkest there

Y'all industry niggas should be feeling ashamed
Y'all like "he ain't still in the game, we stealing the name"
Oh wait just a sec that's straight disrespect
If you take shit and get and don't be late with the check
I'm on the underground trying to scrape and scrounge
And sure it feel good to take a break and lounge
All these ups and downs like a roller coaster
Life is a bitch I'm trying to hold her closer
I'm killin' every nigga in sight
The bigger the dog, the bigger the fight
If you really say you know me then you'd figured I might
Try to use my anger as a trigger to write
I put it down simple on the paper or pad
Try to take a stab at what is making me mad
I jump on the track and I ride it through
And do it for the people that are tried and true
But y'all so fickle y'all love me today
And tomorrow love another cat and shove me away
But most ain't committed to do it how I did it
In the way that I did it, in the way that I spit it
It's like my burst of truth and it might hurt the booth
But first the proof, it gave birth to youth
Rap's like trying to take a piss in the wind
I'm just glad to know that some of y'all are listenin' in
Keep movin' along, keep bringin' it on, and keep singin' the song

Keep movin' along, keep bringin' it on, and keep singin' the song

Let's get wild
Yeah, Master Ace in the house
The whole Action Posse's in the house
Ice-U-Rock's in the house, DJ Marley Marl's in the house
Steady Pace is in the house, and we gonna do it like this

So many New Jacks and Jills on the hill
But only one bucket, so fuck it, they get the dills
Cause you no frills, that means your name ain't household
Now watch that little mouse fold
You can't take the pressure from the cooker
Stood there looking soft, so I started hooking off
And took her, I know she used to be yours
Now she's riding on the bus with us and doing tours
Along with some other little runts
We call her a fall girl, she does so many stunts
And then she got liver, she did it with the guy that drives the bus
Now she's a screw driver
Master Ace is flipping
Your grip is slipping, it's time I start stripping
Young ladies and the titles that hold 'em
I treat 'em like a pretzel: bend, stretch, and fold 'em
And I can do the same damage on stage
Black, white, or beige, you're gonna feel the rage
The same way the sluts with the big butts felt it
I'm not a dealer but I dealt it
So if you plan on riffing when I spank ya
Be prepared to grab your ankles because

For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for all of those
Who lost out, cause I was at the polls
And I saw the results as they came in
So many wild-ass ones that need taming
But I hold a whip and a chair
And I don't play fair, so you'd better stay there
Until I say "Jump through the fire"
But I won't get burned, I learned to admire
From way across the room first
And after I study, buddy, that's when I kick a verse
That's high powered, you got devoured
By the jaws of death, you little coward
Scared to step in this arena
Where the grass is greener, you're looking meaner and meaner
But your look ain't scaring me away
So I just stay and say words to make your head sway
Capital A-C-E, boy
Serving the masses, you'd better take some classes
If you want to hang with this here
And if you get near, I'll eat you like a pear (Crunch)
But I don't really eat a lot of fruit
So say "ahh" (Mmmmmmph!) Now don't you look cute?
(Ace is wild!) Nah, no I'm not
(Ace is wild!) I just like to bug a lot
(Ace is wild!) Leave me alone
(Ace is wild!) Turn up the microphone
(Ace is wild!) Yeah...

Mr. Gangster, who you trying to kid?
Fake, flam, and fess and dress the way you did
This is a microphone war
You say you're well-known, but what are you known for?
A porno flick and a hard dick
And always bragging about the girls you stick
Title for king? Yo I don't compete for that
Paid your dues? Let me see a reciept for that
Somebody put you on yesterday
And you fess today, and that's just the way
A sucker is supposed to operate
Just turn on my mic and I'm straight
Now you fronting like you got a million G's
Just because you sold a couple of LP's
Now you walking around thinking you're the man
Cause you bought a little suit from Dapper Dan
But so what? You still ain't dapper
Holding the mic makes you look like a rapper
But you're just a sloppy copy cat
Front on me and I'm a hit you with a bat
Bottom of the ninth, two out, and I'm at the plate
And smack! Over the left field gate
That's where your head goes, you're Rudolph the Red Nosed
And you can't join in, you shouldn't have said those
Rhymes that sound so merrily merrily
Since you're soft like pound cake from Sarah Lee
I might cut a slice, then say "What a nice
Sucker to gobble up with beans and rice"
You fat little rat from the sewer
I eat you like a meal, pass you like manure
Put you in the garden where my flower grows
Then where's your power? Tell me where your power goes
Somebody does your dirty work for you
Throw up your hands like a man so I can floor you
And oh, if you pull a jammy
You can run from Brooklyn to Miami
From Miami to Nevada
You'd better have a lotta, I mean a whole knot of
Payola, cause I'm about to roll a
Mic like a cess joint, so brother here's a bowl of
Pride, now eat it up
'Cause I get kind of wild when I heat it up
(Ace is wild!) Nah, not really
(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly
(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling
(Ace is wild!) Yo yo yo, stop illing
(Ace is wild!) No, I'm not
(Ace is wild!) I feel kinda hot
(Ace is wild!) But I'm not acting wild
(Ace is wild!) You know that ain't my style
(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just cooling
(Ace is wild!) And also I'm ruling
(Ace is wild!) I ain't messing with nobody
(Ace is wild!) I just wanna have a party
(Ace is wild!) No, no

(Ace is wild!) And I'm the Music Man, y'allEmbed
Just sittin' here in the studio, you know
Thinking about the old days
And reminiscin about how things used to be
I can remember back then real well
( *knocking* )
Come in
Oh, what up, yo
Ice U Rock in the house
What's up y'all?
(What's up)
Yo, I was here in the studio, you know
Reminiscin about the past and how things used to be
(Word)
You know
Big man Uneek is here, my man Master Ice, you know
Ehm..
Yo Ice, won't you, you know
Talk a little bit about the old days from what you can remember

As I reminisce back growin up around my way
I can't help but think about the games we used to play
We used to play games that would make parents mutter
Like Tag, Spider, and Hot Peas and Butter
We rode our bikes through Prospect Park
Did jumps over hills and came back before dark
We even rode skateboards downtown and back
In fact, we were scared, so razorblades we would pack
Played basketball ( ? ), and we
Played Chinese handball at a park called 
And he who lost was forced to play the wall
And then got hit in the butt with the ball
And after we worked up a sweat and got loose
We bought a Hero and a 50 cent juice
You might also likeWord yo
Uneek, Uneek, remember back in the day?
Yo, let's Ice finish..

Just think about when your moms used to dress you it hurts
Church shoes and real loud shirts
Feelin dumb, so yourself you redeem
You buy some mocknecks and some tailor-made garbadines
Remember those pants with the pockets on the side
You wore with your Pumas and strutted with every stride?
The winter months appeared to be frenzies
You sported snow boots, leather bomber, then sheepskins
Then when you felt the spring breeze
You bought a name buckle to wear with your Lee's
Campus shorts and shirts in the heat
With a nylon do rag, Adidas on your feet
With real thick laces (Ha!) Am I lying? Shoot
Don't even front, you even had a Hawaiian suit
Haha..
Crazy, I never had a Hawaiian suit, man
Yo Uneek, go 'head

The nineties are here, times are going fast
And it's the perfect time to reminisce about the past
When I think about it, I get a pang
And hear people back then talk with they slang
I hear it now, it sounds corny
When 'give me a pound' was 'lay some skin on me'?!
People wore afros and called it their natural
And if you were soft back then, it meant that you
Were a sucker boy who used to irk me
You never was really down, a jive-time turkey
Most other kids used to joke and diss
It was called a breaking session and it'd sound like this
(That's why you got rejects) then the next guy would say
(But my rejects are new and yours are old, okay?)
Word
Now we sayin Big Uneek

As I reminisce I'll always remember
1984, the month was September
My first year of high school and every fool knows
You had to dress fresh and look hype in your school clothes
I had the clothes with something added
A gold name plate when a few people had it
Now that was trouble, cause you would get robbed
On the bus goin home, by a crazy large mob
They'd sneak on the back of the bus and they looked
For somethin they wanted, what they found was what they took
One day they found me, standin in the lane
They didn't hesitate to say, "Shorty, run your chain"
Before I could fight someone snatched it and jetted
Everyone was a victim and I'll never forget it
Word, man
Them times were kinda rough, man
Yo Ace, you remember times like that, man?

Yeah, I can remember like back then, son
You didn't have to worry about a knife or a gun
You balled up your fist like a man and fought your fight
And kept your left up if your brother taught you right
(Word) Back then, a fist was your best weapon
So you threw up your hands instead of just steppin
And if you lost, you lived to fight another day
I heard a brother say now there's no other way
To win a fight except to use a bullet
"The trigger makes me feel bigger when I pull it"
He said, I just shook my head at this
And that's what made me wanna reminisce
( *knocking* )
Yo come in
Oh yo, it's my dancers, the Big Steps in the house
My man Shawn, S Boogie
My man Glaze in the house
(Always chillin, yo
What's up y'all, how y'all doin man, y'all coolin?)

Strike up the band and hear the plan
Of the Master man as I stand and cast a
Shadow on MC's, you're small like fleas
Can't get with these rhymes, so please
Step back, no need to act
Retarded, cause once I get started the impact
Is thorough, Brooklyn is the borough
Find a fly cutie and squeeze all over her, oh
Snap, she tried slappin', then guess what happened
Jumped all on it when she saw me rappin'
And rockin', G's I'm clockin', knees I'm knockin'
Ease, freeze, put a sock in
Your rap, cause you ain't crap
Talkin' 'bout you're dap
Yellin' and swellin' when you really need a slap
To the grill, yo, you better chill
Rhymes start to pour, you don't need a refill
Will, you ever sweeten up your skill?
Your rhymes are sour like dill
Ill, take em back to the drawing board
Cause they're wack
I place your rhymes in the sack
I slept and I slept and you kept tryin' to mack?
But you ain't nimble, Jack
Tried to jump the candle but you can't handle
The flame, you got burned and learned that the name
Master Ace turns heads to his heart
Anyone tries to flam gets barred
Or get scarred, yo, it's odd
Believin' that you're even? (Ha!) Now which card
Did I pull, I keep rhymin' till you're full
Then I wear you out just like a wool
Sweater, itchier than dead of winter
You can't prevent the go-getter from scorin'
Suckers I'm floorin', cities I'm tourin'
No, I'm not a pimp but I still got em whorin'
(Amazin') to any occasion I'm a riser
I'mma surprise a crowd like a geyser
And gush, take your wack rhymes and flush

Yo, drip-drop the spatula, zip up your lip
And things, kings, I never knew one
But one never knows, do one?
Get into one, rhyme at a time
That's cause I'm ready to climb
To the top, I never stop
Then go like a slow-movin' object
Provin' I kept no rep
I simply take a step
All of those that slept are in jep'
And, this here bumrush is planned
Action Posse in effect, understand?
Mister, for your tongue here's a twister
I came with a girl but dissed her
Bad, she made me mad
Into ever fad, and style in the pile, so I had
To treat her, like a child and seat her
Had to Baker like my name was Anita
Damn (What?) Guess what, the girl tried to flam
(Word?) So I made her feel like gram
Cracked her stale and dry
But I didn't smack her, I winked my eye
And said, "Yo peace, geese, hit the road
Hop along, Cassidy, make like a toad
And croak," yo, the girl broke
Pulled out a shank and then tried to poke
(Nah...) That's when she went too far
She tried to go all out like a star
And shine, I went for mine
This kid was on a trip, so in line
Is where I put her, then I told her to hush
Cause yo, you can't stop the bumrush
Yeah, here it comes
(Here it come, here it come)
Yeah, here it comes
(Here it come, here it come)
Yeah, here it comes
(Here it kiddy-come-come)
The bumrush
( *DJ Action cuts up* )
(Here it come, here it come, here it kiddy-come-come)

Fly girls I adore, others I ignore
When it comes to joints it's points I like to score
Layin' down the law, just like a judge in court
You got a grudge, you got taught
A lesson, never half-step in this profession
Especially if it's somethin' that you're fresh in
Stop messin', you're playin' games like the Reds
Money I'm earnin' as I'm turnin' your heads
Bring on your crew, I ride em like sleds
Then I play em out just like they was Keds
So go get your Freds, your Barneys too, and then soon
Every cartoon in your crew'll be a goner
Cause once I get upon a
Brother, I smother, yet you front like you wanna
Come, you young bum, you little crumb
You're from the slum, come, you must be dumb
If you ever thought you were clever, I say never
Your rap floored, standin' on the trap door
I'mma pull a lever to my dungeon
You're fallin' you're callin', you're small and
Deep into the hole I watch you plunge in
Poor child, I grin, then I smile
While you're bein' eaten by a crocodile
You lost, you're done, it cost ya, son
Eatin' mush, cause you can't stop the bumrush
Yeah, here it comes
(Here it come, here it come)
Yeah, here it comes
(Here it come, here it come)
Yeah, here it comes
(Here it kiddy-come-come)
Bumrush

I'm malicious, vicious when it come to a duel
And any titty who gets witty, I pity the fool
Cause you get smacked up, if you act up
You get traction, Action's got me backed up
I'm kinda slim, but never hear the ladies complain
I'm slinky trim, I'm wicked but I never inflicted any pain
Cause I'm chill, I do with ease
In fact, the only ones I hurt was the ones that like to flirt and tease
Please, that's for strippers
(Cinderella...) take off the glass slippers
And the gown, please don't frown or make a sound
(Lay down) on the bed or on the ground
I like the bed and I like the arms bound by the head
And now it's time to pound
Fill my mouth with the big juicy rounds
Flesh yes and put my hand across her mound
Her curly hair, yeah, now you hound like a pound
I use the pillow, so the screams can be drowned
Then you smile cause you came to my town
Master Ace was the one that you found
To make your face red, like Steady Pace said
(Yo, her face look flushed)
I said yo, she can't stop the bumrushEmbed

I got to avoid surrounding myself with too many materialistic things
But I got to live the life enjoyed by the law-abiding black kings

Then I got to use my knowledge of the English language to write songs that teach

I want to say peace to DJ Mister Cee, Steady Pace
The whole Action Posse, the whole Action Posse
The whole Action to the third power movement
And everybody that believes in Master AceEmbed
"Ready to rock this at the drop of a dime, baby"
"Master Ace!"

Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off them, I'm a come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
And the blow that I deliver is a crisp one
Give that style back, Jack, and try this one
If you're gonna pick up the microphone when the beat is moving swift
You'd better say something I can get with
Suckers I mold in my hand just like Silly Putty
You tried to shank me, Spanky, but my name's not McGillicuddy
Yes yes, let's test the water
You're skinny dipping in a slaughter
Hope you wore your water proof hightop certified
'Cause I taught you I've got the murder ride
And you don't have to buy a ticket
You can afford to get aboard and watch me as I stick it
In the face of my foes 'cause it goes to show that I flow like a bloody nose
Raps are sweet just like donuts from Dunkin'
The Action Posse's at the door, and they won't let a punk in
So you'd better try the back door
Before you get a cracked jaw
And I don't need a black had to be a villain
The posse is Action and the label is Cold Chillin'
The question is how hype will you get?
When you heard this beat you was familiar with
A jam you heard before, this is a summary
A voice surrounds you, but there's only one of me
Lyrics of dialect come from all angles
The cordless mic in my hand still strangles
They try rather well, but none are parallel
The words are spinning in your head like a carousel
And out of all the brothers I spoke to
None of them broke through, they sound like a joke too
Their rhymes are very soft, just like terry cloth
The kid's that standing on stage oughta hurry off
'Cause that ain't hip-hop, you little drip-drop
Trying to tip-toe but can't touch the tip-top
'Cause you ain't tall enough
To try to brawl and scuff and a style that you call it tough
Is about as tough as a flower
Beware of the posse raise to the third power
'Cause we ain't caring, don't mind tearing a
Cocaine-pushing, Dapper Dan wearing
Walking around with a neck full of cables
My DJ laughs when you touch the turntables
Wannabe hard rock when you roll 10 deep
They told you my name but you act like you been 'sleep
Get back, sit back and chill you no thrill MC's
Slim see, but still I show skill
Words can brutalize without no mercy
Enemies wasting their last breath to curse me
I ain't Shaft with a hat and a Cadillac
MC's lash out, but should I battle back?
Nah, I remain calm and collected
The stage was empty the last time I checked it
But now there's movement there in the spotlight
I can't make out who it is, nah, not quite
A flash of gold from a shiny medallion
A stride of pride on stage like a stallion
Oh, another one of those who try to get close to
But can't 'cause a man's supposed to
Rip the mic 'til the crowd is perplexed, but
With this jam here, there won't be no next up
So peace to Craig G, Kane, G. Rap, and Marley Marl
From the Music Man, y'all

Allow me to begin, once again my friend
Yo, it's Ace in Action, here to send
Any and all MC's into a frenzy
'Cause I'll take a rapper out just like a Benzi
Yeah, this ain't the same old, lame old
Bragging and nagging, yo all that became old
Years ago, and yo, here's a pro-
Fession that I'm am fresh in, and so...
I am going on and on like an adventure
Some of y'all in awe from that cause I sent ya
Hmmm, this move is forward, or would
You like it if I pause, yeah you sure would
But I ain't pausing, no stop, just like a freeway
Rappers, you play me too close, I need some leeway
'Cause it's about time for the party to get a
Little bit hyper and yo, this is a letter to the better
So go check the mail for yours, I unveil the jaws
Then I dog ya, get down on all fours
So we can brawl, the capital A's, the dream
Rhymes are fierce, pierce your ears like a laser beam
Reach, and I'll teach you each the speech
Spectrum, even if you add bleach
It won't fade or run, cause it's made of one-
Hundred percent knowledge to weigh a ton
Listen bud, yo the rhyme's a dud
Pencil or pen and I'll draw
Blood I'll take a strong stance, strictly long pants
No short-taking, when you hear my song, dance!
'Cause you can't keep still, so dance 'til
You drop or the hip-hop stop, but it never will
Yeah, now if you're better, then here's the move
Ace in Action, I'm here to show and prove
Plain and simple, pretend my rhyme's a pimple
Now bust it, and watch it ache your temple
You need Buffrin, you're suffering, can you cope?
Nah, nope, cause it's dope, and you hope
I might slip or trip, stall or fall
But all hope is lost, you've been stalled
You're drugged and youd've been bugged if I'd said a
Another line, end this verse, of my letter to the better
You might also likeI'm flowing, so in fact, kind of rivery
Are you a dope MC? Special delivery
There's no time, here's a rhyme, go ahead open it
This is a letter to the better, I know you're hoping it
Might be some claim on my greatness
But once I state this, watch the crabs rate this
You wear a crown, you don't deserve one
You need a meal for the mind and I'll serve one
Like a chef so def, I'm gonna rip up
Rhymes they gonna rip up those that turn a lip up
One page at a time, you keep reading
Each stage of the rhyme, where's it leading?
You want to know where a path leads, you follow it
I feed you your pride and make you swallow it
Used to be an innocent bystander and the
Lotta years filled my ears with slander
Why should I choose to get used to the way you burn?
When will you learn that every rapper has a turn?
And when the spotlight shines on you, you ought to glow
And show, the next man how to grow
And so, enough said about yourself
The central wealth of our people is mental health
And good things come in due time
And through rhyme, watch as a few climb
Non stop, straight to the top just to get a
Great big piece of the pie, this is a letter to the betterEmbed
Some rappers pick up the mic and like to dabble
But I'm gonna flow with the show and never babble
Take your hand, make your stand
To my left, Jeff, you're a pest and you fessed and
I think you'd better find a new profession
You think that you wanna be a rapper? Well I think you're guessin'
No time for fessin' or fakin', messin' or makin'
Mistakes, 'cause it takes heavyweights to stakes
Or high, so why would you ever want to front?
And try such a stunt, now the Ace is gonna hunt
Ya down, you clown, 'cause the sound that you're hearin' is dope
You can't cope slowpoke, so pick up the soap
And catch a bad one, you wanted a chance and you had one
You lost it course you sad one
You can't get with the style you hit with
In this rhyme, so maybe next time

Uptown, downtown, crosstown, no matter where you're from
Get on the floor and get dumb
'Cause the Master, capital A-C-E is about to kick it wicked
Here's the title, in your face I'm gonna stick it
But yo don't reach, leash the speech that you use
Needs a little more spice, ice, you're nice
The style that I heard was third nerd, you gotta be sweet, Pete
You can't make money sayin' rhymes on the street
So yo get back, Jack, a smack is what you might just get
To the grill, Bill, so chill, or I might just swing, King
Crown, you're down you're like a wingless plane, Wayne
'Cause you ain't fly, in fact you try and I'm a rain
Right on your head so shed hats and coats
The votes are in friend, I win hands down, clown
You tried biting, but biting is a crime
So maybe next time

I like to cruise around the city, find me a witty
Seditty, sexy young lady that is pretty
(Meow meow meow) Says the kitty
The hotel room I got's a buck fifty
Booties in miniskirts, cuties and plenty Certs
To make sure my breath is up to par and
I introduce myself as the capital A-C-E
And say "Hello" and "Bonjour" if she's foreign
And if she's a little bit older I'll put her head on my shoulder
And I hold her, 'cause nobody told her
That the Master Ace, could move so many hips
Just by the sounds from my lips
Well um dinner was a winner, the movie was groovy
The park was dark as we walked and talked
Stayed and played, chased and raced
Sat and chat, shared and stared, into each other's eyes and lies
Spilled from your mouth right then
'Cause as we kissed you insisted, you had no boyfriend
But I know you cousin and your cousin dropped dime
Oh well, maybe next time

MC's actin' wild better get calm
Or you'll get laughed at like like a sitcom
I spell my name A with the C-E
Not an "LF" folks, and I'm displayin' "Different Strokes"
Huh, I'm "Head of the Class" fast and furious
Rhymes as you get "M*A*S*H-ed" as I have "Good Times"
And "Happy Days" I'm slick like a hummer
And smooth and kick my rhymes like a punter
"One Day at a Time" is how I live life
So no I'm not "Married With Children" and no I do not have a wife
Instead I would prefer to have a girl and
Experience "Growing Pains" 'cause it's a "Different World" and
Rappers try to play me, just like a sport
Try to bite my rhymes at "Night" but get "Court"
"Give Me A Break" catch a "Taxi" and leave town
You might be a "Star" but I'll "Trek" you down
Rapping, it's a living and it's been one for years
"Jeffersons" in my wallet, champagne in my glass, I say "Cheers"
You wish you could be slick with the rhymes, don't you?
But maybe next timeEmbed
To get ahead, in life
I must avoid the rain, and the pain, and the strife
I have to keep (people) striving
I want to be among the young that are surviving
So I go and get a job and
Work amongst the jerks that I used to be robbing
My boss' name is Rick
The kind I used to vic on the ave with a stick
Now I'm taking orders
Dreaming about the days when I went to Latin Quarters
Me and my batallion
Scheming on the kid with the link and medallion
Rolling with the rush
Anyone that stepped in the way got crushed
But that was then, this is now
And I don't want to join my best friend
Cause he bit the dust
Went one-on-one with the kid and got bust
I can still see the blood
Pouring outta his head, red like a flood
I stayed up til dawn
Cause I knew, that it was time to move on
"Keep moving, keep moving on" "Moving oooooooooon" (Repeat 4x)
You might also likeHot summer night
Rolling on the deuce just looking for a fight
Take a few flicks
As they walked past we harassed a few chicks
I snatch her by the arm
Her man's up the block so she screams in alarm
But we don't give a fuck
He's wearing pennyloafers so we know he's a duck
Try to play hero
And catch a bad one you nerd-looking zero
Pockets are bare
Stetsasonic and Dougie are up at Union Square
Let's take a ride
Even though that we know that we can't get inside
Standing out front
On the prowl, on the hunt
Who's it gonna be?
Some kid rolls up in a 300 E
Uh oh, time to wreck
Diamonds on his wrist, his fingers, and his neck
Sweat on my brow
I wish I knew then what I know right now
Cause now I'm reborn
And I know, that it's time to move on
"Keep moving, keep moving on" "Moving oooooooooon" (Repeat 4x)
Here's the break
This is the break
My man Dre waves his fist
To the crew that means no assist
So he stepped
The kid was at the phone booth, yeah he slept
It was simple
Dre just hit him with a blow to the temple
Then he fell
The girls that were standing in line start to yell
The kid's out cold
Dre's kinda bold, he's putting on the gold
Then another yell
The crowd starts running and I wonder, "What the hell?"
The kid on the floor (Watch your back!)
Came to now it's his turn to score
He had a gun
Pulled the trigger before Dre could run
Then he jumped in the Benz
And he jetted off, we had no wins
These days I think
As I hold the cup of success, Dre would never get a drink
Cause that night a very clear picture was drawn
It was was tiiiime to move on
"Keep moving, keep moving on" "Moving oooooooooon" (Repeat 4x)Embed
Mmm...yeah, that sound kinda ill...word...yeah... Master Ace in the
Studio with my man Marley Marl, y'know... Got DJ Clash in the
House...and my DJ, Steady Pace on the cut, right? 
Right, so I'm about to get into somethin' here...

I'm Master Ace, from a place
Or should I say borough
Where they like the bass to be thorough
With the kick of a mule
And the click of a tool with no bullets
In the clip, it's the trick of a fool
Cuz he who fronts gets blunts you can't smoke
To pull such stunts is no joke
You better know where you are first
Try to be rude and get chewed like a Starburst
Now how much juice you got?
You couldn't hang if I made a noose and knot
Now try that on for size
Too much baseball, too many apple pies
Click your heels three times, kid
And now you can see what my rhymes did
Suckers and nerds come in herds just like cattle
First I brand them, then I hand them a rattle
So they can make a little noise in protest
Those that fussed got bust wearin' no vest
I told that MC to go West
Let's see who can put on a show best
The creep that tried to sleep got no rest
I got a rap that can trap a slow pest
Where's your girl? She's out on a ho quest
Fingernail tips, red lips, summer stroll dressed
In a camisole she's a pro blessed
With a great big backside but no breasts
Welcome to the fire pit
I know some kids that wish you'd worn some flyer shit
Cuz as soon as you stepped off the train
They woulda put a big nine to your brain
Be on the lookout, and yo, keep lookin'
Cuz there's a battle goin' on in Brooklyn
You might also like
Just like the water in a river flows, I'm fluid
And as I do it, I deliver blows
So MCs, you better keep your left up
Try to fight and you might just get F'd up
Cuz I'll terminate, as you learn a great lesson
Don't ever try messin' or you'll earn a fate
Worse than death cuz I'm here to give it to ya
You got a life, but don't know how to live it do ya?
I live on a day-to-day basis
Doin' my shows in all kinds of places
You sit home with a frowned-up grill
Talkin' 'bout who ya gonna kill
Well listen up psychopath
Put down the Uzi, stop tryin' to play Shaft
Cuz life ain't a TV screen
Bullets can puncture the skin, rupture the spleen
And the stuff that flows out your veins ain't ketchup
Sit back, relax as I sketch up
The scene on a Brooklyn street on a late night
It was a great fight to me
I was just an innocent bystander
Let me try and, uh, explain why I'd hand a
Brother a big fat stick
Well it was that, or get his black ass kicked
See, it was five against one
But this brother was too proud to run
So he stood in like a trooper
Fightin' against all odds against a group of
Brothers that looked the same way he looked, friend
It was a battle in BrooklynEmbed
The music man (Repeat 4x)
I am the man, but I'm not the one with the can in his hand
I'm down with a different kind of street band
And I appear from place to place as the Music Man, AKA Master Ace
Stacks of flyers are pressed up
All the party people are home gettin' dressed up
Just to hear the sound of the underground
Fusion, and the bass like thunder pound
And so they pack the show just to see
He who claims to be the Music Man
The music man (Repeat 4x)
It's about time for the music man to rip
First I take a sip, then a light grip
The crowd tight into my hand with a loud
Intro, then throw lyrics from a cloud like Zeus
I'm the one to get the ladies loose
Baby, you just got seduced and juiced
By the Master Ace, I'm not a villain from a place
In the West, that was just the way I was dressed
And so, looking for lust I stand
I got girls, but I would never bring sand to the beach
Each and every person give a hand
And sway with the capital A, the Music Man
You might also likeThe music man (Repeat 3x)
I bet you thought that the Music Man would take a short
I fought tooth and nail to prevail in this sport
So lend me your ears, my peers because here's
A brother who doesn't fear another because fear's
In the mind, so don't try to scare because you might find
A chair thrust upon your back with the wack
So there, I put you in your place with haste
Now flee, cause now you can't be Master Ace, the Music Man
The music man (Repeat 8x)
I'm here to reach the youth
The only way that I can do that is to teach the truth, so I do
Some used to diss and dismiss this
But then many of those small minds grew
To understand the mission of the Music Man
I know the time, plus I clock dough so I'm grand
But I'm not a father, no I'm more like the sun
Shining down on every single one
So run, run and tell m all
Yell it from a wall, the Music Man will never fall
Or fail, raps tip the scale to get you hot and
I wear cotton, I don't bail
Or pick, but I like to kick
Raps, haps— you have none, so quick
Gather round, hear the sound of the man
'Cause I can, yes you know I can, yes I can, can
Satisfy with the fly display, this may dismay
But I am, the Music Man
Yeah I'm the Music Man
The music man (Repeat 4x)2Embed
Take a look around
Take a look around, take a look around and ask yourself: Why?
See all those people on the other side of town, livin large and postin high?
Take a look around, see that bum rush to this liquor store?
He's all out of Thunderbird, but I got to say more
Take a look around as the wealthy and rich
Go to plush parties and do-si-do together, ain't that a bitch?
Cause they're movin on while most of us sit back complainin
Bout, "Ain't nuff opportunities for our people", like it's always rainin
But take a look around, cause I see plenty of sunshine in the sky
Maybe next time, instead of complainin, you go out and get a piece of the pie
Take a look around
Take a look around
Take a look around as more young people take their eyes off the prize
See my man Simon talkin bout he's gonna put a kit
And a rag-top on that 560 S-E-C he buys?
Take a look around at the music man on the corner playin his sax
Fillin the air with jazz
He's a one-man symphony, see that 2 dollars in change in his hat?
Yo, that's all that brother has
This is just a little letter about the situations we live in
Take a look around and realize: to succeed we just can't give in

Hey brother, take a look around

Now money made is not necesserally money earned
But those who earn money seem to have a lot less
And not very often are those tables ever turned
But then again, money's not a measure of success
The power of 3, you see, is ever present
Slide and ride this groove, to get the meanin
Only a true king can call someone a peasant
You hold a microphone, but for a throne I find you fiendin
Pursuit of happiness and money are not the same
There is some overlap, but they're still separate goals
Because it's possible to have one without the other, a shame
Some don't realize it, so they sell away their souls
Take a look around
Take a look around
As I walk through Grand Central I see so very many
Brothers and sisters that are down on their luck
Is there really pie, and they just aren't gettin any?
Or is it cause they're lazy and they just don't give a fuck?
Walkin through the park I see Bam-Bam playin cee-lo
4-5-6, Bam just lost 3 g's and a kilo
Who says they only play for kicks?
Take a look around
Take a look around
I remember Jackie, when Jackie was a hottie
Jeans used to fit her like the skin upon a grape
Me and every other brother fiended for her body
But she's smokin, so now look at her shape
Now Mrs Green goes to church like every single Sunday
And she had three sons, Ron, Mike and Dale
Maybe if she'd done a little bit more than just pray
Ron wouldn't be dead, and the other two, they wouldn't be in jail
I remember Mr. Tee, he used to walk with a limp
He had a wooden leg, y'know, cause he lost it in the war
Maybe if this country had made some attempt
To take care of their veterans, Mr. Tee, he wouldn'ta have to die poor
Take a look around

Ace in Action
Steady Pace by my side
The name of this one here is Together
This is goin out to all those who some day reach that fork in the road, you know?
Cause we all have the potential to get there together
Listen up
I got a problem, the Ace is bubblin
Physically I'm fit as a fiddle, but somethin's troublin
My mind, I'm in search of the find
A style that's designed just for this kind
Of a raid, it's a must to get paid
Or fade into the wack parade
And so you can't wade
Through this groove, it's as deep as a diver goes
As I proceed, the liver it grows
Then it reaches your ear, teaches you where
You are and where it should be, to each his share
Unadultared, dope, I made it to cope
With any that hope that I faded - nope
I'm still on the scene, kill all the mean
Stares, who cares, they hurtin nothin, when will you fiend
For somethin attainable, somethin more gainable
I build and I'm filled with knowledge undrainable
It's overflowin, before long you're goin
To find out, you kept your mind out of growin
The way you did it, was you didn't admit it was
Somethin that applied to you, you should bit it, cuz
But you chose to ignore, I suppose you explore
Only things with wings and a halo - sure
You're not a saint, but you try to paint
A picture that'll get you respect, don't you know it ain't
How large you're livin, or what you're drivin
But what your goals are, so keep on strivin
And gainin, maintainin
Keep your brain intact, this is mental trainin
For the minds that have given up
Other are livin up, if you want a sip, then go get a cup
And we'll take a drink from the fountain
Of success, yo, let's all climb the mountain
Together
You might also like
We're gonna get there
Oh yeah, we're gonna get there
Together (3x)
We got to, got to, got to
Get there together
Who's with me now, raise your hand
Need inspiration? The capital A's your man
I'll inspire you to strive a little higher
You won't tire, and not even barbwire
Will obstruct your progress, I guess
You wanna succeed? Determination is what you need
Face your fears and place your tears aside
Raise your peers to the top, here's a guide
For you to follow by, try and swallow my
Food for thought, and you're short of an alibi
There's no excuses, the rhyme just spruces
And juices up a small mind, so call mine the loosest
Cause I get looser than mice in a basement
I grab the mic, and that's when the place went
Wild, Steady smiled, I didn't crack one
Not that I'm mean or that I lack fun
But the topic is serious, listeners are curious
Rappers are lerious, the Ace and I'm furious
It's not the kinda rage that makes me wanna rant and rave
Across the stage like a beast in a cage, I save
All the screamin and shoutin for the next man
The look on my face is the proof that I'm vexed, and
I don't yell, I don't swell, I tell facts
And simply stated I made it, sell tracks
But I want respect from those who chose to
Flap your rat traps, cause heaven knows you
Made a mistake when you chose to oppose
You tried to step on toes, now you're dissed - case closed
Cause like it or not, Action is gettin there
So keep on sittin there, riffin and splittin hair
And critizisin, I got my eyes in
An upward glance, and I see us all risin
Together

Listen up
Who says a brother can't get his with his
Eyes on the prize, realize that it is
Highly probable that someday he will
Believe and therefore achieve, but we will
Keep an eye out, cause he might try out
A quicker way to payday, but I doubt
The brother knows: the harder the wind blows
The faster the quick cash goes, and I suppose
Gettin paid everyday means improvement
Bust the movement on the floor as the groove went
(Together) as the bass kicked, the Ace picked
The mic up, and now I'm gonna strike up a taste licked
By a licker and bitten by a biter
Sucked by a sucker, I fought like a fighter
To get the meal rarely barely shared by
A brother of color, but I'm not scared, I
Don't wanna stop, to the top it's a rat race
Or should I say rap race, I wanna get that taste
My mouth is waterin, who's that orderin?
The Ace'll slow a pace, I'm almost borderin
On breakin, cause it's there for the takin
And I'm not fakin, yo, I want the bacon
But I'm not hurryin or worryin, there's time for
Me to get mine, but I made a rhyme for
To use, so you score, it's more like food for
Empty spaces, now the Ace is in the mood for
Seein the black with a tack with a feather
Cause we don't need a 2x4 just to get there together
Yeah, yeah stopEmbed
How do you do?
I'm from the other side of town
The place where the only skin you see is the color brown
The sun never shines in this place where I live
And it's hard to do right when you feel negative
I have no compassion
I only know aggression
And there is nothing great about this oppression
People I see on TV, in there towns live the good life
But I live out of bounds
Where nobody comes unless they're forced to come
In school, they call me the bum from the slum
But they don't know
My sista has no food to eat
And her hand-me-down shoes are too tight for her feet
The way I see things, life isn't fair
So I never learned how to share or to care
But to hope - and hope
Instead of feeling down
And that's how it is
On the other side of town
You might also likeI live on the other side of town

Pardon me, brotha
As you stand in your glory
I hope you don't mind as I tell the whole story
Some people livin' life like fun in the sun
But yo, others are givin' strife, and that's all they know
I feel no comfort in talks from the President
So put back on Cosby
A shack is my residence
I think if I ever die, it might be a blessin'
Some say I never try, but why are they stressin'
I'll never get ahead; my raps have a better chance
I'm livin' on Wonder Bread with holes in my leather pants
I'm not on the drug scene; they call me a crack head
I just had a bugged dream that I was a black man
Workin' in the hospital
Then in came in a half-dead rich bitch
Yo, they must be insane
You think I would save her?
Yo, she wouldn't save me
I asked for a quarter once, and guess what she gave me
A fuckin' penny
Her coat costs half a mill
If it's up to me, yo, she's pushin' up daffodils
In a casket
Payback's a female dog
Yo, send her ass to the morgue
Then I woke up, and I sat with a frown
Damn, I woke up
But on the other side of town
The other side of town

My teacher's a fat man
Yo, how can they tempt me so
Fuck geometry, my stomach is empty, yo
Can't you teach me to win this crazy game?
You and I are in so many ways the same
People tell me, but I don't believe that shit
Why do you sell me a dream, then leave me spit?
The truth is bare, and so is my cupboards, too
I wonder what could even L. Ron Hubbard do
Because my mind right now is on the brink of breakin'
Yo, look how I think
I think I'll stick up the store with the Arab guy
I'm sick of him anyway; his prices are too high
Or maybe I'll start sellin' Avon door-to-door
Then pull a jammy, and make a bigger score
Nah, maybe I'll start sellin' dope for my cuz
Then I could drive the same car he does
The life of a poor man
Consider me desperate
I sleep in a cold room
And wish I could just get
A piece of the pie
Is that asking too much?
I can't even reach what others have in their clutch
I wish I could go on, but I have to end this
And get back to livin' a life that is winless
There's no use swimmin', so I might as well drown
In my sorrows
'Cause tomorrow's the other side of town
The other side of town
The other side of townEmbed
Are you ready?

Hell yeah, I'm ready. My bags is packed
Let's get out of here

Jesus, what's with the clothes?

Man, fuck you, you don't know nothing about this
'95, '96? This was the shit! You crazy?

Well, my boy, in case nobody told you, it's 2001
Here, give my brother another call when you get home
He owns a bunch of stores in the five boroughs
They sell all that FUBA, Sean Jean, Prat Farm
You know, all that stuff you people wear

Man, fuck you, "You people"
'Talkin that shit, man

So tell us, Ace

They grade you on how good the beat soundsEmbed
After Graduating from the Institute of Disposable Arts
And recieving his degree, Ace went back to Brooklyn
And made a better life for himself
He started his own label
And artist management company a year later
Eventually he moved out of the projects
And bought a small modest house
In a quiet section of Brooklyn
A month after he went away
His ex-girlfriend Lisa became pregnant for the third time
This time by a baller from New Jersey
She still lives in the PJs with her three kids
And she occasionally does hair for extra cash
Her ex-man before Ace, Tyreque
The one who tried to have her car jacked
Is currently serving a 25 to life sentence in Virginia, for murder

Now I know you're probably wondering
What I was doing in that hotel room with Fats Belvedere
Sorrounded by bags of cash and credit cards
And counterfeit cashier's checks
I can't front, I'm asking myself that same shit right now
Well it all started a few months earlier
It was the first day of summer
In the borough of BrooklynEmbed
The name's Fats Belvedere
And if you live in my hood, and you got big credit
Now I'm the man you come to see
Mastercard, Visa, whatever it is, I either have it, or I'll get it
Now I've known Ace for most of my life
And I was always telling this guy it was crazy
To be going out there, breaking his ass
Making phonecalls, sending emails
Running in and out of town for a few grand here
For a few grand there
But he had a passion for it
Ya'know he didn't care
And honestly, I had to respect him for thatYou might also likeEmbed

Nah man, I don't fuck with poppies yo
Little young cats always in the front of that store
Shootin' and acting up, ya'know what I mean
I go up the hill to habeeb's
It's a little longer walk but it ain't no problem

Yo here's the deal, Ace
I know you got this little tour coming up, right?
I was thinking since ya'll ain't doing the

So we hit the road, did shows every night
And he would do his hustle thing on the side
He was loving the road too
The parties, the limelight, especially the chicksEmbed
Do you ever song a little song like this
When you get up in the morning?

Dear diary, (Yo) what a day it’s been (Now I hope you ain’t releasin’ another album)
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream (Let me ask you something)

Ayo Ace, don't tell me you thinkin' about a return
I'm kind of concerned, when will you old cats ever learn?
It's time to hang it up when you stand on your last leg
When you don't write on the reg and your future is past dead
I'ma tell you ‘cause none of these cats will
You can't still try to rely on your rap skill
You ain't got nothin’ behind you and believe me
Not a label out that gon’ find you and want to sign you
Write your rhymes in the shower, you’re washed up
If there was a law against wack shit, you'd be locked up
These cats in the game pretend that they your friend
But as soon as you walk away, they talkin’ ‘bout you again
Half your old group don't like you and want to fight you
And even made songs about you to try to spite you
Big Beat dropped you and said that you can't sell
And they ain't had a hit since before Pac was in jail
It's like the shit’s up under your nose and you can't smell
Hell, you probably older than Blu Cantrell
You can't tell? It's over, capital O-V-E-R
And that's just in case you can't spell, c'mon

For goodness’ sake, what's happening to me? (Oh you prayin’ now?)

Yeah I heard all of your prayers but I doubt that God got 'em
So break out the suits and ties and the hard bottoms
And get yourself a job with a desk in a nice office
And learn to enjoy all of the garbage that life offers
And don't ever again show your face on a stage
Or write the name Masta Ace on a page, kid ya done
Whoever let you back in the door should get a smack in the jaw
‘Cause you sure shouldn't be rappin’ no more
You already proved that at the Lyricist Lounge affair
Tryin’ to battle with rhymes you wrote on the way there
Maybe next time you'll know not to play fair
Say your best written shit and school 'em like daycare
But through the sad mess and all of the bad press
I can't recall a time in the past when you had less
Ain't nobody out there gon' keep it realer than me
We one in the same, sincerely, your diary

Dear diary, (Stupid, man) what a day it’s been (What’s wrong with you?)
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream (Psh, let these cats gas you up)
Woke up too late, (Thinkin’ you could put another record out) wasn't where I should have been
For goodness’ sake, (Sad, man) what's happening to me? (Start a family and move somewhere, get a job or something)
Dear diary, what a day it’s been
Dear diary, (Probably checkin’ for your ass) it's been just like a dream
Woke up too late, (You gon’ waste all these people’s money) wasn't where I should have been (You ain’t gettin’ no video)

Microphone check'a one two
Microphone check'a one two
Microphone check'a one two
Tell 'em what I'm gonna do:

On and on and on is how the beat goes
So sell the British Walkers and cut the afros
And dance 'til the feeling is gone in your toes
I wear shorts in the summer, Timberlands when it snows
Sometimes I like to chill, sometimes I like to mingle
Sometimes I get the fever for the flavor of a single
Sexy young slimmy, but not too young, though
That's because Jimmy might end up on death row
Now this here jam is like a special kind of song
It's not too short, but then again it’s not too long
I brought somebody with me, someone you might know
He's bound to wreck your body from the tip of your toe
All the way up to your last hair follicle
You might also like
Hey hey hey, it’s me the diabolical
Yes, y’all and, it’s time for me to fall in
To a funky beat to make you have a ball and like
Jump, make you move your rump on the floor and like pump
C’mon don’t be a chump, I see four and maybe five
Live party people but the rest did not survive
(Why?)
They had a cardiac arrest
Now, rocking microphones is something I do daily and
Making people dance like if I was Alvin Ailey, and
People just love it when the Biz starts to play
With my  and by the way
Skeezing with a girl is something I get tricky
And I’m the sneaky type to like slip a girl a mickey
And I live the type of life that’s far from affordable
Standing on the corner calling cuties on the portable
Me and master ace is funky (word to miz)
Yo, who is it Ace? (it’s me and the Biz)

It’s me and the Biz (repeat 4x)

Yo Ace, I got an, um, question
Excuse me brother, but can you spare a dime?
Naw, but if you want, I can kick a funky rhyme
All I need is a groove that’s as smooth like a harp and
I’m ready to talk ‘nough shit like Al Sharpton
I take the stage and engage in a page and
My name is Master Ace and 22 is the age

Yo, I'm the B-I-Z-M and, like a lot of women
Bought a new car because the first one was a lemon
Gucci, Louis, Fendi. Me and sexy Cindy
Riding around the block as if I was in the Indy.
Everybody pointing cause I am the joint and
They know it's me, because I'm the B-I-Z
Sometimes I lie in bed all day and think about my life
Should I just kick rap and settle down with kids and a wife?
And get a regular job where I'm working 9 to 5
Shit, I'm the Biz and it's great to be alive

I'm making crazy hits, a winner never quits
So those that used to diss me in the past are having fits
But I just sit back and kick my feet up on the table
'Cause I'm able to rock a crowd without a cable
Or a Cuban link and (yo, Lincoln wasn't Cuban!)
So I still produce Def Jams like my name was Ricky Rubin
M-A-S-T-E-R and this ain't store bought hip-hop from a jar and
It sure ain't Stephanie Mills playing Dorothy in the wiz 
It's me and the Biz

I'm a 100% proof and rag on the roof and
Pulling crazy cuties without a gold tooth and
Wilding, styling, this land is my land
(you're a) prisoner to my music like you was on Rikers Island
A slim, soft-spoken brother from the ghetto
My name is Master Ace and I thought that you should know
You run your rhymes like a horse and force and
Extra booty lyrics on the crowd like you’re the boss and
I think you’d better keep them to yourself
Do it for yourself, put your lyrics back up on the shelf
Now I’m going to pass it to the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E
'Cause I know you want to see him

Ah one two, one two, this is what I’m gonna do
Keep the place jumping, get it wild like a zoo
If anyone can do it, the B-I-Z can
Peace to Marley Marl, Tragedy, and MC Shan
And my cousin Cool V and, TJ Swan E and
The Jungle Brothers swinging from a tree and
EPMD and, Nice and Smooth B and
MC Craig G and, Just I-C-E and
The list goes on and on and on and on
I go to Dapper Dan or Benetton
Hey hey, I got some shoutouts, I know you all bought my new album
I know everybody in Brooklyn bought it
Everybody in Jersey bought it
Everybody in Uptown bought it
Everybody in Philadelphia and California and Florida bought my new album
I’m Biz Markie, I’m down with my cousin Cool V, TJ Swan, Marley Marl...2Embed

Here we go, we're on the late night tip
Master Ace with a tight grip
Tight enough to hold the crowd, control the loud
People, they gather to hear a rather proud
Brother, originator of the third power
Action the posse grows just like a flower
Check it out, here's the scene
The nightclub, you know what I mean
The dancefloor - nuff heads
Gucci girls, a few tuff dreads
Homeboys dipped in silky
Leather seats in the Benzes often milky
Cuban link, a lotta Moet to drink
Cash spent as fast as you blink
And all you hear is (go, go, go)
None of these folks are livin' low
They're livin' on the (high)
(High)
You're postin' high

Yo, look at slim (word) she's soft as satin
Livin' on the upper west side of Manhattan
She's paid, I mean bucks
She's got a maid and her butler wears a tux
And look, look at the car that she's drivin'
Before we leave here tonight, watch me get live, and
Swing it, rope it up and string it
Open up and sting it... (yeah right, K)
O-oh, what's up, you think I'm jokin'?
Just because I'm broke and I came here by a token?
Yeah aight, sleep and keep snoozin'
Give me a week, in her Benz you'll see me cruisin'
I'll be like, "yeah, what up, yo?"
(Yo) "want a lift to the 3 train?" (yeah, man...) No
Call a cab to come and get'cha
'Cause I'm too damn fly to be seen wit'cha

Is that a diamond in your gold front?
Cute - so is that custom-made Gucci suit
Cost a lot? Damn, that's kinda steep
Oh yo, I think you got a beep
The pay phone is right - oh, you got a car phone?
Go right ahead, I be at the bar alone
Hurry back, okay? Hurry back
'Cause as I look around, these other girls are very wack
( *humming to the music* )
Damn, ay yo, what's takin' her so long?
I wanted us to dance, they just put on my song
(Yo Ace, there she is) Ay yo, who's that she's with?

Oh, it's like that? Well, go head, miss fly
I see how you're livin', you're livin' on the high
Post
(High)
Yo, she's postin' high
Alright, alright, maybe you are right
I need to stay down off the post, because the hype
Might make me light in the head, so instead
I stay down on the ground where they frown, 'cause they're fed
Because they wanna live a life with glamor
They hope and hope and hope, but like a hammer
Reality shatters every single hope
So what they do, is simply try to cope
But who can be happy livin' in the state of poverty
Watchin' the next man live greater?
All he ever does is wish for a chance
Wishin' he could buy the suits and the silk pants
And all she ever does is pray
That one day she'll have a full-link mink, but hey
They want somethin' for nothin'
You gotta work, jerk, it's not that tough, and
Wise up, rise up, and then you can size up to the fly
And wear the clothes of those that post high
(High)
Postin high
Post high - but keep a level mind
Post high - but never live blind
Post high - but never make that
The most important whisker on your cat
Post high - but never put the next man down
Post high - but keep your feet on the ground
Post high - but don't forget your friends
While you're doin' laps in your Benz
Postin' high
DJ Steady Pace - is postin' high
Mr. Cee - is postin' high
Craig G - is postin' high
King Asiatic - is postin' high
Biz Mark and Cool V - are postin' high

Ayo, you came up in the spot 'cause you heard that it was hot
Even though, a week ago, somebody was shot
They said the cops came and swarmed the whole block
And shut the club down but, nope, they did not
'Cause the spot so packed you can barely even walk
The music so loud, it's impossible to talk
Y'all just point where you want to go, glass held above
The crowd, you don't spill a drop, ladies showin' love
You got three in the V.I.P., waiting patiently
It's gon' be a crazy night, just you wait and see
You got chicken wings, champagne, fruit on the platter
Spendin' all this money like the loot don't matter but it does
Y'all know what it is, y'all know what it was
Y'all ain't got the riches, y'all just stuntin' for the bitches
Y'all ain't having fun, y'all just frontin' for the bitches
It's funny how your whole style switches up in the spot

Brooklyn, New York, we in the spot
Everywhere we go we in the spot
All the way down south we in the spot

But you are, got the tits pushed all up in that bra
You and your friends looking all up in that car
You're gonna need a telescope to really see a star
Cause that ain't who you thinking is
A lot of drinking is the absolute plan
This is not the spot to find a man
And you're looking for a prince, are you dense?
Want a man with dollars but this ain't making sense
Baby girl, you striking out, swinging for the fence
Alcohol strong, you can barely even talk
Heels so high, you can barely even walk
Blue drink, green drink, yellow drink, red
Colors of the rainbow, settlin' on your head in the spot

So I can go to Egypt see the Spinx like Leon
Come back to the states, send a 100 G on

'Cause they bought some new wears, but really, who cares?
Half these cats is fruit, like two pears and one apple

Where I hang like a tassel, looking for some girls to wrestle
Got spice like Dijon my legion from the Brooklyn region
I'ma preach on
And baby if you ninteen like Keyshawn
I'ma go deep on it so don't sleep on it
If you got my pager number, put a beep on it
But don't forget your code though, on the low though
Niggas rock Rolex watches with no doe
Living in the PJ's with they DJ's
Your whole album is nothing but cliches
Why you wanna say what another MC says huh?

A lot of shows, a whole lot of groupies, a lot of hoes
A lot of cars, a lot of wild nights at a lot of bars
Met a lot of fans and met a lot of so-called stars
Mad music, if you can name it I've been through it
Name a club, any big city, I've been to it
I probably did a show at it, dropped a flow at it
Made a lot of doe at it, met a ho at it
In nine-five sat on chrome and still sitting
In two-thou', still M.A. and still hitting
Still shitting, still got styles that still bitten
Ain't nothing changed really this rap game is silly
Rocking the cream Timbs in a green Benz with clean rims
Running with three of your mean friends
Hoping that your team wins
But that's when your dream ends
Soon as I come out I make 'em dumb out

Ayo, ayo, when I'm on the mic I splash
Uh huh, uh huh, yo I got that shit that splash

Yeah, BK, Uptown, Boogie Down, Queens
It's beautiful

Listen, I got a lot to say
Usually my smile stay locked away
But not today, I have to laugh on the real
The aftermath's kind of ill like I'm Dr. Dre
Sometimes I run to the club and get faded
This game make you get jaded, I just hate it (just hate it)
But this song gives a different kind of feeling
It's a new kind of dealing, it's a special kind of healing (uh huh)
And I can show what it is
Best flow in the biz? You know what it is
Positive over negative, see the Ace a Masta
Even when I face disaster (that's right)
I rise up above
See, people still showing me love
Got the respect without dropping a check
This hip hop thing might stop in a sec
So this brand new hit, you can pop in the deck
It's beautiful

So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful

Yeah, this is brand new Uptowns still in the box

This is Boca Raton on a catamaran (that's right)
With the sun beaming down where you at in the sand
I feel like I'm more than a cat with a plan
This feels like it's more than a flash in the pan
This is milk in the cup and cash in your hand
This is a warm coat on the coldest night
That's why I stole this mic, y'all don't hold this right (nope)
First in a class of many
This is a bottle of Jack, no a glass of Henny (that's right)
Now drink it up 'til there ain't nothing left in it
I'm repping it, BK, that's a definite
Just more of these amazing rhymes
A song like this in these days and times is beautiful

So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful

(I'm wishing on a, on a, on...) the most beautifullest thing ever
And it's here to bring terror to the bling era (yeah)
You can feel it in your inner
It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving dinner
It's like a day in the park
Or at night when you get the ball and you play in the dark (swish)
It's that street corner music
Where most cats when they pull that heat gon' use it
I see a black man aiming his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claiming his son
You know the sound is pretty
Even when you got to get down and gritty
This is money in the bank like you down with Diddy
This a helicopter ride around the city
And we love it cause it brought us here
It's a young mother braiding her daughter's hair
It's beautiful
So look inside yourself
Something you never felt
Feeling like nothing else
What's inside goes beyond your mind, it's beautiful14Embed

I'm about to have your whole team wishing
That you never got this shit started
You about to be dearly departed
You gotta be nearly retarded
To let me hear my name mentioned, tryna gain attention
Now I'm running through this game lynching
And I heard a few cats tryna take shots on the low
These XFL rappers tryna fuck with a real pro
One thing; who named y'all the High and the Mighty
To me, y'all just sound like a couple of high whities
You had to be on mad coke and ecstasy
To think for a second, you can stand next to me
Look don't ever again mention my name in your freestyles
Or I'll cut off your transmission faster than Lee Myles
And I heard your album, this must be something you're new at
Cause I'd rather hear a Lil' Wayne/Lil' Zane duet
My cellphone stay ringing like a slap in the ear
So I hope y'all don't plan on making rap a career
Cause ever since Heav' was in Vernon I been burning
Next year, y'all be up in Rawkus, interning
And I should've let it known what your government names are
To make sure you Take It Personal like Gang Starr, motherfuckers

I took a minute, I gave your single a fast listen
Tell me this, with no pot to piss in, how you dissing
Your group homes are about to be reporting you missing
And I don't know what was worse, the track or the verse
I'ma get to your producer, but I'm smacking you first
See I couldn't even find one nigga that heard of you
I did find a few cats that wanted to murder you
But I told 'em chill, I let 'em know you was my son
And I promise I can pay support til' you twenty-one
Consider me the clothes on your back and a warm meal
Who knows, this might just get you a deal
And the day that your album go on sale for the first hour
Just remember like Nas nigga, I Gave You Power
I figured I give ya some help, cause you need lots
I make your producer change his name to Speed Nottz
Tell him I say fuck him for doing the tracks
Matter of fact, fuck Fat Beats, for doing the wax
I'ma diss you via e-mail and then through a fax
I'ma diss you by two-way, I ain't gon' never relax
I'ma diss you over fast, slow track or no track
If your shit wasn't so whack, I'd diss you to your track
You that little fish that I catch and I throw back
And by the way, give 50 Cent his flow back
You that cat in the club that get hit with a bottle
Fuckin' with me, you better off tryin' to hit lotto
And don't answer back, this is hard shit to follow

I'm a leader and, you a follower
Your goal hollow and your ho was a swallower
She put it down like a report
But her box smell like South Street Seaport
What a odor black, in fact
When I got her in the sack jack boy I couldn't hold her back
'Cause her bottom is, thick like a hippopotamus
Tramp stamp on her lower back
See I know the facts, the hoe filled me in
Her best friend is a twin named Lillian
I'm going really in, I'm really going in
Foul, I bust on that towel that you throwing in

Big up Ace, I'm glad I had a chance to flow with him
Just last summer me and my mans did a show with him
In Montreux, hit the stage, I'm like "Go get 'em"
Even had the soulless folks rocking with no rhythm
Marco Polo was on the wheels and on point
They did Jeep Ass Niguh, I'm like "That's the joint"
Some old school heads remember who was who
Brooklyn was in the house, even the newbies knew
Before the Masta left the stage from doing the do
Blew off the roof with a tribute to Guru
First time I met the brother felt like I knew him forever
Too clever, album dedicated to his mother
I thought of mine at the same time, we growing up
I know they proud of they baby boys, we blowing up
Only got one, won't ever forget her
Make sure you let her know you love her when you with her, kiss her

Sand in Havana, ran to Indiana
Then came back for the green like Bruce Banner
Used to rock a bandana
And dream of driving in a car same color as a ban-ana
But now I'm smarter than a fifth grader
Which hater wanna try to rub it in like hand sani-
-tizer, realize that I'm a lot wiser
But I won't blow my top like a hot geyser
So put away the damn camera
I don't smoke coco, po po on the damn scanner
Hoping they can apprehend, African-
American men in a planned manner
But I ain't fallin' for the okey-doke
So back away, and turn yourself around like the hokey poke
Is this a racist nation or is it just my imagination
Like the song that Smokey wrote

Tonight on this very mic you about to hear, I swear, the best darn artist of the year
So so cheerio yell scream bravo, also, if you didn't know, this is called Da' Pro
