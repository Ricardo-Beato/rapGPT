It's 50 Cent and S-N double O-P
You don't want no snoop and you don't want it with me

Everytime I come around they like "Oh No"
I get to trippin; slap the clip up in my 44
Shit I been thru in my hood made my heart cold
I get to poppin off that thang like I'm loco
No sense in coppin pleas when you see my knife out (knife out)
Motherfucker its light out (light out)
Here come snoop, uh (oh shit) (Oh No)
Sup nigga, sup now huh? (Oh No)

Ricky Ticky Timble, C's is the symbol
Courdoroy khakis, stacies & brimmed up
Straight razors just keep you trimmed up
1-8-7, oh yeah, now you remember
He's electrifyin & original
So gangster, Snoop Dogg the criminal
The one you hate to love, in the club, in the cut
Hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga I don't give a shit
You betta check dat ho, that's what wreckin G
Now step your game down, cuz ain't no checkin me
You'll be respecting me until I leave this room
Or my gat'll go boom, bullets go zoom
Now your name is on a tomb
They pourin out liquor with no room to consume, ya silly bafoon
I pop niggas like balloons, I ain't feelin em
Walkin in my big blue chucks cuz I'm killin em
You might also like
 Hey what up cuz, it's 50 Cent;
What's happin nigga?

Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin (yea)
Hundred miles an hour pulse flyin wit my eye... an
He who fears fate lives like coward
You go against me, you'll be devoured
That nina get to poppin you'll have change of heart
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc usin donors, dead niggas wit spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snitch, and the heart of dead narc
Niggas never see the light till spark
Then they bleed, it get cold , then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push me, a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin
Your services are no longer needed; rock-a-bye baby
My bitch will do it to you with a lil 380 (yea)


I'm bailin thru the door again
Let momo pour again
Me and my ho again
Yea she got the four up in this motherfucker
And I'mma bust it if you try to rush us or touch us or sucka ducka us
It'll crack off, now back off -real slow
An if you don't know , I never hesitate to shoot a ho
Yea that's my reputation - you test my patience &
You & your fam - bam - gon hear the blam, blam
Goddammit I'm at it again
They done let bitch niggas up outta the pen
And now he lookin for me - what the heck - my game is built on respect
Now I'm breathin down your motherfuckin neck
I dumps till my clip is empty
I'm headin down willshire to send the scent
And when I get there don't ask who sent me
Just take dem shots and drop it like it hot
Bitch nigga

Ha-ha-ha
Yea nigga
Just when you though I was gone
Slide back up on you like the wind nigga
