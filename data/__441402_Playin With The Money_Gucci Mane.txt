9 ContributorsPlayin With The Money Lyrics
I feel like Eazy with these locs on
Lookin for some dusty shit to smoke on
She's so fine, need a bad bitch to poke on
I love trap bitches, this a grown folk song
Put yo hands up if your money real long
Put yo lighter up if you smoking real strong
Got this strong pack here like Incredible Hulk
Red diamonds on my wrist matched these red chucks
And if a duck weren't up to be a dead duck
They call me Guwap cause I got my bread up
I put a dude up and I do up in a red cup
These niggas playin games, now they got me fed up

Playin with the money, playin with the money
Havin money nigga, I ain't havin paper problems
Playin with the money, playin with the money
I'm havin paper nigga, I ain't havin paper problems
If I was going broke nigga I'll rob ya
If I was going broke nigga I'll rob ya
If you need some work fool nigga I'll front ya
If you need some work fool nigga I'll front ya

It's Gucci Mane the playa, feel like Nino at the cop
Only difference bout it, I'm the East Atlanta jug
Used to get the work and the pills came from Florida
And you my protégé but I can never ride a Mazda
Hoppin doors with your main hoes, calamari pasta
In the Ferrari California, sittin on Forgiatos
And your girlfriend said she pregnant but you know you not the father
If my plug would have been a pussy, then I would have robbed him
Got them green and white Air Max 95's cause I just came from Boston
Try to follow me on I85, well fuck ya I done last ya
Amigo say don't like to fuck with blunts cause all these niggas didn't cross school
I cross the trash, ran up the set
These hoes say that I'm awesome
