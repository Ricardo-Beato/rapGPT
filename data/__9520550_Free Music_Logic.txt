4 ContributorsFree Music Lyrics
One take, yeah, yeah

I'm bringing free music back with this
Leaving no one intact with this
Spill my guts on the track with this
Tracklist looking miraculous
Hairline looking like Dracula's, out for blood is a fact I'm is
I ain't no bullshit activist, active I'm is no cap in this
Rappin' this from my mental on young Kenny's instrumental
This shit right here my credential, essential to my potential
Girl, pass the brain with no dental, my lyricism sequential
The meaning is confidential, poetically exponential, hold up (Ahh!)
I'm bringing free music back with this
Leaving no one intact with this
Spill my guts on the track with this
Tracklist looking miraculous
Hairline looking like Dracula's, out for blood is a fact I'm is
I ain't no bullshit activist, active I'm is no cap in this
Rappin' this from my mental on young Kenny's instrumental
This shit right here my credential, essential to my potential
Girl, pass the brain with no dental, my lyricism sequential
The meaning is confidential, poetically exponential
So influential, the rest is not essential, hold up (Hah!)

I killed it, yeah, lemme go back in
A milli' what I made in '15, I dreamed of that shit at 15
In '18 I made like thirty, but after taxes that's fifteen
I paint the picture like Sistene but I don't think that y'all heard me in the first place
Nah, they ain't heard me, listen
A milli' what I made in '15, I dreamed of that shit at 15
In '18 I made like thirty, but after taxes that's fifteen
I paint the picture like Sistene, created way back in '15
Hunnid twelve, deep in my mind you delve
Full of codes like Da Vinci
Don't pinch me, I don't wanna wake up cause' that dream done came to fruition
I ain't rapping for the commission, I do this for the community
Built an immunity to this lunacy that ruins me
Built a DeLorean and went back to the ruins of me
I could have made millions off of this shit if I put these flows over original instrumentals, but I did not
I did it for the love, I did it for the freedom
I take a beat and then beat 'em, beat 'em, ahEmbed
