20 ContributorsLong Money Lyrics
Hello. This is the Exec Banker 6050 Money Counter
It can tell you the value of the bills counted as well as the piece count
All you have to do is tell it what denomination you’re counting and it gives you both value and piece count
Ok, I’m gonna turn the machine on by pressing the button in the rear
By the way, this machine can be 220 volts or 110, so if you need it with European power please let us know
As you can see after it comes on a nice big video screen lights up…

Jacuzzi on the roof, ugly hoes don't get the time of day
Chiefin' on sativa, smell the reefer from a mile away
Pistol in my coupe, try my troops, you'll get blown away
Gucci Mane got long money, bitch, that's all I got to say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
I ain't even gotta talk, my money conversate

We been stunting
Got a money tree, I drown the bitch with money
Ferrari with them bumble-bee, Forgiato sitting up under it
(How many carats in that bracelet, baby?)
I think about 200
Plus I hit the club with 50K, let's keep this shit 100
Got a couple houses, several spouses
In my penthouse, smoking ounces
Came up selling keys and ounces
Half a pound, white, gold, and brown
My pants sag, grands weigh 'em down
Used to catch the train to go downtown
Just to walk around and window shop
Now I shut the mall down every time
Every time that I hit the scene
Fresher than I wanna be
Cover of the magazine
Back of the limousine
Stacks in my denim jeans, hoes gon' remember me
458 ship to me from Italy
612 sitting outside the facilities
9-1-1, Gucci ice game killin' me
Came a long way from drug dealing
Waking up rich is a great feeling
Couple million stashed for my grandchildren
Just hand count a mill', coupe half million
Up on 'em, pull up on 'em
Like a bird, drop low and shit on 'em
Piss on 'em , spit on 'em
Tell them haters, Gucci got rich on 'em
It's Gucci

Gucci Mane got long money, bitch, that's all I got to say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
I ain't even gotta talk, my money conversate

Every city, I make magic, I make money disappear
'Cause it’s a tragedy how clear these diamonds blingin' in my ear
It's so many wanna marry me, I'm married to the game
Cocaine put me in position, swagger brought me all the fame
I need accountants to help me count it, Rolls-Royce, I mount it
Corvette painted candy, drop the top and bitches crowd it
Houses in Zone 6, all my niggas hustlers and robbers
Don't fuck with us, you'd be better off fucking off with angel dust
I'm racked up like a pool table
Stay draped up and purple label
Drank purple drank, smoke purple weed
Got a purple car and long paper
Every day thank the Lord that I wake
Every day living like my last day
Shine so bright rock stupid ice
More carats in my chain than a carrot cake
Money short, he runnin' out
I'm bussin' out, can't close the vault
Ain't my fault, It's yo' fault
Nobody stays here, this my money's house
Stash house, stocked up
Try to fuck shit, get chopped up
I'm rocked up, stay blocked up
I ain't locked up, but I'm guaped up
It's Gucci
Jacuzzi on the roof, ugly hoes don't get the time of day
Chiefin' on sativa, smell the reefer from a mile away
Pistol in my coupe, try my troops, you'll get blown away
Gucci Mane got long money, bitch, that's all I got to say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
I ain't even gotta talk, my money conversate

All you have to do, it’s ready to go, is take your bills in flat and drop them in flat like you would on a tabletop
Very easy to use, it counts through and it says, “25”
Now if I take these bills and put them in again, it starts over at zero again and says, “25” again
However, if I push the add button, now, if I drop them in it’s gonna start where it left off and continue
Now, it says, “50”, drop them in again, it’s going to say “75…”

Jacuzzi on the roof, ugly hoes don't get the time of day
Chiefin' on sativa, smell the reefer from a mile away
Pistol in my coupe, try my troops, you'll get blown away
Gucci Mane got long money, bitch, that's all I got to say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say
I ain't even gotta talk, my money conversate7Embed
