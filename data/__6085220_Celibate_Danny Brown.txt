41 ContributorsCelibate Lyrics
(A-A-Ah)

If I knew you, I would send you to the store
Pulled up in a Porsche playing Kenny Lattimore
It's The Matador of Metaphor, you wrong like the letter four
But trying to sell that, stepped on Macklemore (Macklemore, macklemore)
Jesus Shuttlesworth with butterworth
Used to call me Mr. Get What Your Money Worth (Your money worth, your money worth)
She suck it in like potbelly
Ain't really got a ass, but she top-heavy (Top-heavy)
In a Chevy looking like somebody told mе something
Talking to your big homies like thеy owe me something
I ain't got time, bitch, I'm Rollie hunting (Time bitch, time bitch)
Had the big head, spinning small face hunnids (Hunnids, hunnids)
Hoes treat me like wormholes
Mouth like I preordered it, I download (I download, I download)
Clown knows that brown nose
If you ain't getting money, what the fuck is you around for? (Around for?)

I used to sell a bit (Sell a bit)
But I don't fuck around no more, I'm celibate
Had me trapped in that cell a bit
Locked up with some pimps, told me "Sell a bitch" (Mmm)
I used to sell a bit (Sell a bit)
But I don't fuck around no more, I'm celibate
Had me trapped in that cell a bit
Locked up with some pimps, told me "Sell a bitch" (Oh)
You might also like
Neglected with them sentences
Fighting for better bars like reforms in prison
Keep on the mission, higher than tuition
Intuition tellin' me you're fuckin' with me, you're wishin' (You're fuckin' with me, you're fuckin' with me)
Out of place, like carpet in the kitchen
I'm in something, ain't got no ignition (No ignition, no ignition)
Get attention like two hoes kissin' (Two hoes kissin', two hoes kissin')
Wit' their lips poked out like "Whatcha talkin' 'bout Willis?" (Oh)
No ill feelings, eight ball look like Krillin (Krillin, krillin)
Feelin' down for the killing if you play me for my shillings
It's a trillion different ways, I can shorten your days (Different ways, different ways)
Fly shit you never found like airports in the maze
Long way up but a short trip down (Long way up, long way up)
I'ma let you get your turn, but not right now
It's a long way up and a short trip down
I'ma let you get your turn, but not right now (Not right now, not right now)

I used to sell a bit (Sell a bit)
But I don't fuck around no more, I'm celibate
Had me trapped in that cell a bit
Locked up with some pimps, told me "Sell a bitch" (Mmm)
I used to sell a bit (Sell a bit)
But I don't fuck around no more, I'm celibate
Had me trapped in that cell a bit
Locked up with some pimps, told me "Sell a bitch" (Oh)
Uhh, you used the stellar shit
It's a difference from the truth and how they telling it
There's some 'za go for high, but I could sell a bit
If you spook, and neither God know where the cell is
Sometimes you settle with the price to build the etiquette
I got a better grip on life, my peoples delicate
I went through deserts when the ice to find the messages
I had to pull a blessing out the sky at my emptiest
Why all his blessings in disguise keep finessing him?
I hope the lessons thick
I'm giving pressure to them guys, niggas gelatin
I keep the premises alive
And believe the sentences I scribe
Niggas fed this shit
We gon' need to check these niggas lines, niggas sentiments
When we talking Benji's and the vibe
Feeling separate, I got something heavy on my mind
Where the dreadies sit, how did niggas left me out for dry
Feeling envious, cause I draw affection through the slime
Now my belly big, lost a couple bredrins to the grind
I could never quit, I just be adventurous with mines
Need the pennies quick, niggas still invested in the bribe and the friendliness
Only ones to question me was God and the federate
I be saying less like I forgot, fuck your regiment
I won't take a rest so niggas pop, there's no resemblance
Cause niggas play pretend for different sides
I used to sell a bit
But I don't fuck around no more, I'm celibate
Had me trapped in that cell a bit
Locked up with some pimps, told me "Sell a bitch"1Embed
