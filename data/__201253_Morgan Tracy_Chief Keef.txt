(Zaytoven)
Woo, woo

She shakin' ass, but that shit, it don't amaze me (Woo, woo)
I'm off the Act', this shit got me feelin' lazy (I'm leanin', bitch)
I was born in the '90s, fuck the '80s (I'm a '90s guy)
'Cause I got lots of guap, why these niggas hate me (Nah, for real)
Big shouts out to mama, she the one who made me (Ayy, Lolo)
Big shouts out to grandmama, she the one who raised me (Louise)
Them people made a star named Sosa Baby (Almighty)
I spend lots of guap, then get more again, Tracy (Beep, beep)

I'm smokin' on this dope, this shit, it got me high as fuck (That dope)
You disrespect the Glo, you know we gotta light you up (Bang, bang)
And all you hear is ambulances and them fire trucks (Woo-woo)
Thirties choppin' cars, screwin' shit like Wranglers (Bang, bang)
Coolin' with the stars, I ain't talkin' famous (Nah)
I'ma break down this cigar, puff, puff, no passin' (Nah)
They say I'm gettin' fat, bitch, that's what them bands did (Ffft, beep, beep)
They ain't see me, they see my car, and they say I'm handsome (Skrrt, huh? huh?)
I got too much guap fallin' out my pants (Ffft, beep, beep)
These bitches in my hair, I'm too rich for some dandruff (Chief So)
I don't do the dash, bitch, I do the damn drift (Skrrt-skrrt)
These boys don't want no smoke, they don't want no cancer (Nah, bang, bang)
Get 'em by the loads when I get them bands in (Ffft, beep)
No, I ain't no Brick, but I'm money dancin' (Let's get it)
I like dirty Sprites and dirty Fantas (True, true)
Get shot with this llama, I ain't talkin' Kendrick (Woo, woo)

I'm off the Act', this shit got me feelin' lazy (I'm leanin', bitch)

Big shouts out to grandmama, she the one who raised me (Louise)
Them people made a star named Sosa Baby (Almighty)
I spend lots of guap, then get more again, Tracy (Beep, beep)16Embed
