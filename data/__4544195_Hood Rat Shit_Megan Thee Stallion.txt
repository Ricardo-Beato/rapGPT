15 ContributorsHood Rat Shit Lyrics
I want to do it 'cause it's fun
It's fun to do bad things
(Hood rat shit)
Drive into a car (Ahh)
Did you know you could perhaps kill somebody? (Mwah)
Yes, but I wanted to do hood rat stuff with my friends
Ayy, ayy, yeah

Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy)
Everywhere we go (Ayy) we be drinking Hen (Ayy)
Shake that ass, shake that ass, bitch, bounce that shit (Ayy, yeah)
Hood rat shit (Huh) with my hood rat friends (Ayy, yeah)

I'm from South Park, I be in Dead End (Hey)
I move to the 'burbs and put my friends on some licks
They wanna know 'bout me, they say, "Tell me your story"
Only thing you need to know is I'm in love with the money
Out here and I'm getting it, ayy
Young rich bitch, I'm pretty, ayy
Little bitty waist, big titties
Whole lotta hot shit, hot shit, hot shit
Four 5-0 can't stop shit, ayy
All my niggas gon' pop shit, ayy
Big ol', big ol', big ol' ass, all my bitches gonna pop shit

At the strip eating chicken wings with a thick bitch
Make it clap
She be dancing just like the diamonds up in my necklace
