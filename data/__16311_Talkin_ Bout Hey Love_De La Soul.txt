16 ContributorsTalkinâ€™ Bout Hey Love Lyrics(The radio is so clear in here.)
(Hey)
POS AND ANN ROBERTS:
Hey Love
Talkin' bout Hey Love
Wanna be your push and shove
Pop, popcorn up above
Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love
Discover all the football teams
Mack and eat jelly beans
Run in the cold with no jeans
Get yourself sick till we're seen
Catch the flu and make tea
How Dan Stuckie life will be
It's all about you and me
Cause you're my Hey Love
(Hey)
Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love
(Hey)

POS: Talk about what?
TESHA: Don't play stupid with me, you know what we gotta talk about
POS: What?
TESHA: About you becoming fully dedicated
POS: So we're about to go through these line-runs again, huh?
TESHA: You're damn right. I wanna know whatever you do for me has anything to do with love
POS: Look, I come all the way from L.I. to the Bronx to see you, isn't that showing you love?
TESHA: You see that's just it Pos, I don't wanna be just your Bronx
Love, I wanna be your Hey Love
POS: You wanna be my what?
TESHA: I said I wanna be your Hey Love. I mean it's just not the mood being one of the many girls on your list, and you wouldn't be dissing me like this if I was your Hey Love
POS: Look, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose
TESHA: Yeah but you even give better treatment to that girl named Selena from uptown like a Daisy. You even
Gave her some of your special donuts for free
POS: So this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts
TESHA: No, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about Hey Love
POS: Look I don't understand why you're dissing me, it's not like I'm Paul, I don't have two kids in every state
TESHA: But you probably got two girls in every state. If you're not
Going to go about it the way I want you to, then just leave, cause I can't be so bothered
POS: Yeah. (mumbled)
(I can't be your lover)
(Where's that voice coming from? From... from nowhere?)1Embed
