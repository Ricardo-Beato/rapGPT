Yo, (Wu) one two (Tang) one two (Wu-Tang)
It's the Wu (Wu-Tang) creepin in the shadows (Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
Sir I, Excalibur  (Wu-Tang...)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
Yeah

My rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar raysâ€™ll burn through shades
Rhyme grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb, keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors stem from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Fly sistas flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high, leave styes in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, poly like Cochran, and Sharpton
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a British Bulldog, observe the stats

Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelming the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's that these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome might tend to squeeze off
And spray, an array of shots
That travel downwind, just respect my prolific pen
As I ascend, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power Eiffel tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our cream
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned
(Oh baby, for heaven's sake)
(Oh baby, for heaven's sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)

Yo, yo, this is Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Darts blend aim take fire pure destruction
Disappear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranded with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverend, put the best work in

(Oh baby, for heaven's sake)
