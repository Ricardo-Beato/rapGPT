14 ContributorsMaxine Lyrics
You got your hands on Mooney shit?
Say word
We gon' get high
I don't give a fuck about that nigga
He a bird anyway
Baby taking his packages
He a snitch, too (Ayo)

In Pam's house there was money missing
She was too dumb, had her nose numb, sniffin' blow in the kitchen
Her kids never ate, BCW's involved with her
Kids that she never seen, shipped two to Florida
Maxine, dark skinneded, bald headed bitch, mean
Pam's right hand, together they're the coldest fiends
Aw, shit, guess who arrived at the door
It's Mooney the supplier, "Shh, don't open the door!"
"Bitch, open the door!" "Maxine, he gon' kill me!"
"Chill, I got a friend cop," "Girl, you don't know his beef"
Three long kicks, the hinges flew off
Kids screaming, the heavy face slap blew Maxine head off
It's on in the crib, "You wrong for what you did
You gon' pay, Pam, fuck that, boo, kiss your kids
Y'all get the fuck in the room", "Fuck you, you ain't our real daddy"
"Next time you see my Caddy, don't fucking flag me"
This is where he fucks up at, peep his movements
Maxine's in the kitchen crying, grits is boiling on the side
She had a cup of lye, somebody gotta die
"Uh-huh, y'all bitches fucked up, smoked out my packages
Y'all had Mackie's shit and Pappy's shit
Word to Aunt May I want mine"

Pulled out the nine, get in the tub
He seen the hot iron, pulled the plug out
He steamed Pam brought it back to Penny on Good Times
Back in the dollar bill, he sniffed like six lines
He put his gat down, why he do that?
Creeping through the crib was Maxine, pot holder down with the grits
Pam sucking his dick, Maxine Al Greened him
Screaming, slipped in piss, he ran in the seed's room
Grits down cryin' aight with his balls out
He stepped on Clarence, Biggie Smalls album
"Boobie get that nigga!" Pam yelling, "Rip that nigga!"
Mookie went and got the dye out the kitchen
James jumped on Moon, poked him with a screwdriver
Broke the TV, niggas watching Knight Rider

This is Pam Jerkins mother house
The same shit go on at her brother house
You know Mooney's only a buck-o-five wet
He only had two hundred dollars worth of shit
And the kids tore his ass up

The seeds had a huddle up, I felt sorry for him
The funny shit when bowlegged Keke hopped on him
Jumped on him, pigeon toed Mookie, poured lye on him
You should've seen this motherfucker's face frying
Half dying, they stuck a fork through his nuts
The little girl was happy, she picked her brother up
"Quick, pick the window up," Mooney overheard
Right before they threw him out, the nigga said, "Word?"
On the count of three
He landed right in front of the first floor balcony
Blood, brains is splattered
He was dead
And the cops never came
That's Stapleton

All, all, all in together now
We getting fresh, getting right for the weather now
And if we fall in the game, yo, that's never now
Come to my projects and we'll air you out2Embed
