10 ContributorsDrop Coupes Lyrics
Niggas be nervous on the mic
I’m real comfortable
Look

Count my dough and smoke up
I’m from California
Mean my weed is potent, all my bitches go up
Where you from? So what?
Ah, y'all niggas so tough?
All you niggas so broke
All my niggas so up
California sown up, and I’m still a owner
And I’m on my shit, smellin' my aroma
Fuck you niggas, watch this
Roley with no toc tic
Oops, I mean no tic toc
Never took no pit stop
Every time my shit drop
Victory for hip-hop
Never mind my title, I’m the up and coming Michael
All I got is ice on, skinny as a rifle
Still my pockets fat, nigga, bitches need some lipos

Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from them mixtapes, shut down retail
Switchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin' dues
You might also like
Built my foundation strong, now I live like a boss
Even good niggas hate you, but fuck you, I'll kill you all
Sippin' that lean, huh? But niggas not trill at all
Niggas is playin' with me, like sushi ain’t really raw
Like guns don’t really kill, and bullets ain’t really hot
Like I ain't a fuckin' fool, 2000-and-20 Pac
He said hit 'em up, X said shut 'em down
I been going hard, ain’t no stopping now

Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from them mixtapes, shut down retail
Switchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin' dues

I can’t see the ceiling, y'all can’t see the reason
I keep killin' niggas, but I can’t leave em breathin'
Bro said do it to 'em, I’m gon' do it to 'em
See these brick walls? I keep on going through 'em
They can't stop it, nigga, this my profit, nigga
It’s my real sweat, y'all ain’t killed shit
But if you a real nigga, had to do real shit
Come from a real struggle, hustle and deal shit
Promise you feel this, know that you fearless
All of my real Bloods, all of my real Crips
Doing her thang for you, shout out that real bitch
Hop on them planes, nigga, taking them field trips
Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from them mixtapes, shut down retail
Switchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin' dues

Ain’t no excuse for my failures
My success, no apologies
All that I own
Absolute honesty
Keep it 100
But that’s what they all say

Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from them mixtapes, shutdown retail
Switchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin' dues6Embed
