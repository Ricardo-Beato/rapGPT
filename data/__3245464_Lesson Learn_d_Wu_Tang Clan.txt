Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Wu-Tang niggas don't play
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Def Squad niggas don't play
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Jersey niggas don't play
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Staten Island niggas don't play

I said one, two, three and to the fo'
I glide like there's simply no traction on the flo'
10304, live action from the door
Shawty dime, let the whole team smash her on the tour
I splash bravado, fast cash aficionado
Savage vandal, I'm a legend of tomorrow
Painting the truth, here's proof, ain't it the truth
So ill a nigga spit with a containment suit
Slayin' the booth, aim, shoot, bang! Cave in the roof
Hater, wouldn't last a day in my shoes
You know very well, bet he swell, you can tell he jeal'
My price hiking like the pills Martin Shkreli sell
Mathematics tracks, I craft havoc
Fact, I black on it, black, I'm back at it
Mathematics tracks, I craft havoc
Fact, I blacked on it, black, I'm back at it

Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Wu-Tang niggas don't play
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Def Squad niggas don't play
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Jersey niggas don't play
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Staten Island niggas don't play

Yo, I'm on top of the world, mama, lookey here
I'm a boy beastin' in my car, Paul Revere
Horsepower, never fell off, look in the mirror
When I drop something, you like Martin, all ears
Late Night Letterman, I light it like Edison
Fire through the wire, I wrote it out in Maryland
Arrogant? Yes. Tune in, my Hot 9 Flex
Cut the check and your boy digress
At my age it's all about bread
Tryna be nice at 40, you can have it all shawty
I'm tryna make history, and history say
Fuck rap, I divorced her, the bitch bore me
Throw your hands up, let's tear the bar up
So much bud I started sweating cigar guts
And these white folks love me like a Starbucks
Fuck with one dude, you gotta fuck with all us
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Wu-Tang niggas don't play
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Def Squad niggas don't play
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Jersey niggas don't play
Niggas in the streets gon' learn
Them Staten Island niggas don't play
