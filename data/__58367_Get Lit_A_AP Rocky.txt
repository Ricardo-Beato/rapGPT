1 Contributor8 Figures Lyrics
I ain't really tryna brag but
I-I got eight figures in the bank, get your shit up
Money comin' in from different ways, it's a set up (Yuh)
Bad chick wanna talk for the come up (Bow)
She ain't want me back when I was broke then she switch up
New piece shining like it's in glitter (Ayy)
If you tryna' snatch it I'ma have to call a hittah
Eight figures in the bank, get your shit up (Yuh)
Tryna' surf the wave but you be strugglin' to keep up

Copped a AP that's a wristwatch (Ayy)
Buss it down it so icy it drippin' on my socks
I just hit a two-piece rocking flip flops (Brr)
Biddies they all up on me
They want me 'cause I'm hot (Ayy)
They don't-They don't phase me
Shawty don't amaze me (Nah)
Got em' on a regular (Bow)
I get em' on the daily
Pull up to the function and they throw it back, back
She want me to hit it and she got a phat jat

I-I got eight figures in the bank, get your shit up
Money comin' in from different ways, it's a set up (Yuh)
Bad chick wanna talk for the come up (Bow)
She ain't want me back when I was broke then she switch up
New piece shining like it's in glitter (Ayy)
If you tryna' snatch it I'ma have to call a hittah
Eight figures in the bank, get your shit up (Yuh)
Tryna' surf the wave but you be strugglin' to keep up
You might also like
I need a bad chick
Shawty I could chill with (Bad)
Hit it from the back, she gon' let me kill it (Ayy)
Fly her out from Miami then we get lit (Yeah)
Then another from New York just to play with (Brr)
I-I got all the drip and I got all the bag
She said she want me, she want all the cash
C-Can I wife her? Only hit it from the back
She on my meat told that bih take it back

I-I got eight figures in the bank, get your shit up
Money comin' in from different ways, it's a set up
Bad chick wanna talk for the come up
She ain't want me back when I was broke then she switch up
New piece shining like it's in glitter
If you tryna' snatch it I'ma have to call a hittah
Eight figures in the bank, get your shit up
Tryna' surf the wave but you be strugglin' to keep upEmbed
