10 ContributorsSaigon Velour Lyrics
Okay, yeah, yo yo
Son I walk down the block like it's '76
Pimp robe, fur hat just to match my kicks
And my chain's like 80 pounds of frozen ice
I got four bitches with me, no need to look twice
Throw rice at my feet, rose petals, Malaysian salt
I smoked two Cuban cigars and a Newport
An ounce of the blueberry, big bottle of Tito's
Count the plaques on the wall, like I sang for The Beatles
Went from label to label, changed my name to Clark Gabel
Tony Starkaroni probably fucked your aunt Mabel
In the stash house owned by El Patr√≥n
Big friends in high places, always flyin' outta zones
Big banks in Sweden, vaults in Morocco
But my all time favorite is a Columbian taco

If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street
If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street
You might also like
Original, a lot of style, boom-pow
Blowin' on the pound, puh-puh-puh-puh-pow
Way up in the cloud
Misbehave the flav', now let me show you how
To maintain and sustain as I crush game
Smooth as silk with a little bit of Kush, mane
Plush game, lavish livin'
Bust on the pigs with bad intentions
Smoke dope, go for broke, young loc
The homie said 9-1-1 is a joke (Fuck tha police!)
And I believe that so I protect and serve
Every nigga on the block, that's my word
Cadillac drivin', stackin', providin'
Listen to the sounds of the sirens
I'm a O.G. nigga on a mission
Beans don't burn in the kitchen
I'm twistin' while dippin' and crippin'

If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street
If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street
Guard at the gate, live in a mansion
Rap career longer than an extension
Still hold it in court
Got my wine in the World Report
Or should I say the duPont REGISTRY?
If it ain't now, it will be
Grew up on purple, went from humble
Be bumpin' a bubble truck full of rumble
In a major way, E-40 cookin' out the double
Pot in the kitchen at all times
I'm a boss, still write my own rhymes
Been there, done it, been factor, trapper 'fore rapper
Been 100 from day one, quick thinker, fast reactor
Been a fixture, I don't think it's many left
Been the shit like your baby mama breath
Been in it for a while, benefittin'
Custom houses and cars is how I'm livin'

If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street
If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the streetEmbed
