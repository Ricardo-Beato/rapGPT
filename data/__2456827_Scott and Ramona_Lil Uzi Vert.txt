Baby, you are not alone (Yeah)
You call my phone, I pick it up
She p— She pick it up then drop it slow
Ke— Keep it on the low
From what I hear she got a man at home
I go deep, but got tired of waitin'
Got a situation
Live my double life amazin'

I can't go a day if I don't talk to my baby
I went to my hood, all my friends think I made it
I talk to my fam, man, my mama think I'm famous
Yeah (Yeah), yeah-yeah my mama think I'm famous

Hundred dollar bills in the way (Yeah)
Yeah, it feels good to be great (Yeah)
Now she gonna do what I say (Yeah)
Now she gonna do what I say
I count my dough, I make it stack
I spend on her, I make it back
What you told me, can't take that back
What I told you, can't take that back

I can't go a day if I don't talk to my baby
I went to my hood, all my friends think I made it
I talk to my fam, man, my mama think I'm famous
Yeah (Yeah), yeah-yeah my mama think I'm famous (Yeah)

Rule number one, gotta get all your paper (Ayy)
I'm in a zone, I can't see none of you lames
When I'm not around, I don't know what she sayin'
Say she single, but she know she really taken
I don't care though (Skrrt)
Rule number one (Yeah, yeah, ayy), never trust no ho (Ayy)
Ride around L.A. in a Range Rove' (Ayy, skrrt, skrrt)
Radio blasting (Ayy, ayy), listening to Dej Loaf, yeah

Hundred dollar bills in the way (Yeah)

Now she gonna do what I say (Yeah)
Now she gonna do what I say
I count my dough, I make it stack

Rule number one, never trust no ho
Ride around L.A. in a Range Rove'
Radio blastin', listenin' to Dej Loaf
