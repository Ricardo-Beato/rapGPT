4 ContributorsMakin It Look Easy Lyrics
Good God almighty
Goodness gracious (AYE!), it's like everybody got it
My flow's contagious (Daaaaamn!)
Just one problem, you ain't Jeezy (nope)
Gotta love him tho, he make it look so easy (HA HAAAA)
Young fly nigga, but he talk so greasy
If this was b-ball, I'd be just like Mike
If my bitch outta line, I'll be just like Ike
(Yeeeeeeah)
Take a pause for the cause
Been trappin' three days
I ain't even change draws (Daaaaaamn)
It's like I own a dealership that way I switch them cars
On the grind in G.A. like Field Mob and Chris
Frostbite, somebody help my wrist (HA HAAAAAA)
Pissy drunk, you can smell it through my pores
V.I.P. get hot, then I start sweatin' 'Cris (Daaaaamn)
Club get crunk when they start playin' this (Let's get it!)
Real street nigga, I got a hell of a swag
In '02 I had a hell of a Jag (Wassup!)
Nowadays it's the flyin' spur
Fo' do' coupe got me ridin' her (AYE!)
Ay, Now she ridin' me
On top where she sposed to be (HA HAAAAA)
Lemme see you do the rodeoooo
Bend over to the front, and touch ya toes
I'm in the club, Jewels and 'Cris
Run the Black Card like Juelz and Chris (HA HAAAA)You might also likeEmbed
