My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain, mane?
Reach for it if you want, I'll shoot you in ya brain, mane
We icy as a polar bear, cold as the winter air
If you disrespect the clique, we put you in a wheelchair
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain, mane?
Reach for it if you want, I'll shoot you in ya brain, mane
We icy as a polar bear, cold as the winter air
If you disrespect the clique, we put you in a wheelchair

Call the coroners 'cause the boy smelling bad (yuh)
I'm a thug ass nigga, I let my pants sag (flocka)
I bought swag, I don't trust shit, nigga (bow)
Say, "Fuck Gucci", I'm dumping off the rip, nigga (flocka)
I'll be damned if we let a nigga stop our check (yuh)
They want beef? Load it up, shawty, that's a bet (what?)
No fucking flex, I'm so good (flocka)
Just Google mе, it'll tell you that I'm hood (okay)
Not Cali, nigga, (what?) but out in Cali, nigga (what else?)
I know Cali niggas, su woo, rowdy niggas
Thеy would geek a nigga up like suspenders (flocka)
I see life clearer through these Cartier lenses (flocka)

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain, mane?
Reach for it if you want, I'll shoot you in ya brain, mane
We icy as a polar bear, cold as the winter air
If you disrespect the clique, we put you in a wheelchair
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain, mane?
Reach for it if you want, I'll shoot you in ya brain, mane
We icy as a polar bear, cold as the winter air
If you disrespect the clique, we put you in a wheelchair
You might also like
My ring, my chain, don't you like my chain, man?
If you reach for it, then I'll shoot you in your brain, man
I'm icy as a polar bear, chain locked down like chain gang
Young Juiceman and my diamonds on gangbang
Disrespect this clique, then we'll put you in a wheelchair
Hydra-Shok tip have you rolling in a wheelchair
Think that I'm a rapper, but I will take it there
Then I'm cooler than a fan, but my attitude a grizzly bear

My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain, mane?
Reach for it if you want, I'll shoot you in the brain, mane
We icy as a polar bear, cold as the winter air
If you disrespect the clique, we put you in a wheelchair
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain, mane?
Reach for it if you want, I'll shoot you in the brain, mane
We icy as a polar bear, cold as the winter air
If you disrespect the clique, we put you in a wheelchair

I go hard like Lebron with my superhero bracelet
Check out my arm, I know what to play with
My chain, my chain
Don't you like my chain, mane?
Reach for it if you want, I'll shoot you in your brain, mane
Click clack bang bang, I ain't in the cell
But my bars ill as hell, so just call us the chain gang
See me in the trap with a double-pump shotgun, nigga, I live it
I talked about it, I did it, get it
Pussy niggas better come wit' it
Niggas got dead diamonds, they need air for oxygen
My team icy, you put dummy rocks on your partner nem
Icy like a popsicle, your diamonds need surgery
I might just bring them doctors through, they operate like doctors do
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain, mane?
Reach for it if you want, I'll shoot you in the brain, mane
We icy as a polar bear, cold as the winter air
If you disrespect the clique, we put you in a wheelchair
My chain, my chain, don't you like my chain, mane?
Reach for it if you want, I'll shoot you in the brain, mane
We icy as a polar bear, cold as the winter air
If you disrespect the clique, we put you in a wheelchairEmbed
