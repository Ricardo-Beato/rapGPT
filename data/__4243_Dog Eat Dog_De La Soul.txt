It's a dog eat dog competition (No doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (And I'm out)
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog-eat-dog competition (No doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (And I'm out)
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition (No doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (And I'm out)
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition (No doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (And I'm out)
'Cause I ain't got time for hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love in all the wrong places

Extra, extra, what's that all about?
I'm wishin' the position of my loving's sorted out
I shed a tear 'cause I'm hearin' nothing new or particular
Status once parallel, now it's perpendicular
And everything is just as clear as day
Realistically explicit in the things you say
I guess a "bitch" in the batter's gonna make the flavor fatter
But you gots to keep it for real
Forget about your jewels and gems
You won't be needin none of them
The tool'll fix the era
My mellow used to wear a namebuckle, now he chuckle
'Cause he earn a dime quicker
Talkin bout a burner, sippin' on some malt liquor
And all these kiddies wishin' they were supa emcees
But to earn my "S", I had to learn some mess
About a crime'll make million, a dime'll make a call
I'd rather hop on the line and drop a rhyme to Prince Paul
You might also like
'Cause It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (and I'm out)
'Cause I ain't got time
For hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love
In all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (and I'm out)
'Cause I ain't got time
For hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love
In all the wrong places

Hey kid, what's the word?
Man, it's all about mind
Keeping focused on them self-mechanisms of rhyme
So no longer stand erect 'cause your thoughts are drained
Walkin' round, manifesting attributes of shame
Used to squabble for the mic but now accordingly
We act unless a club can't afford the fee
We act so name that any best man to put us under
Created from the ground yet know nothing 'bout the under
Take a glimpse at them pimps playing record exec
Adding up all your OHs so's to cut you a check
Saying why the blunder wonder could've G'd today
So you can put up some swings for your seed to play
But a swing ain't that important when the park's around the corner
Filled with life causing death, greeting victims for the morning
It was the moment I feared
Nah, the moment I steered upon the right path
To know the right math to overstand
It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (and I'm out)
'Cause I ain't got time
For hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love
In all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (and I'm out)
'Cause I ain't got time
For hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love
In all the wrong places
It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt)
I'll be gone like you're wishin' (and I'm out)
'Cause I ain't got time
For hangin' around
When you're fuckin' my love
In all the wrong places1Embed
