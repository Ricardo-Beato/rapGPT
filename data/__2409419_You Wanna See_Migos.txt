32 ContributorsYou Wanna See Lyrics
Your ho wanna fuck, I don’t want her (aye)
Popped a perky, I’m geeked in Aroma (perky)
You rented it, I’m the owner (aye)
Took your hoe cause she gave me a boner (your hoe)
Look at my dab persona (dab)
In the trap I serve a stoner (trap)
My niggas came from the corner
I got the birds, they sing like the Jonas (brrr)
Eating up rappers, they boneless
I’m finna pull up right on ‘em (pull up)
I’m finna pull up right on ‘em (what else?)
Spraying at all my opponents (graah)
Birds they sing like the Jonas (brrr)
Feeling like Don Corleone-in’ (Don)
We hear that you plotting, we on it (we is)
I call my niggas to dump him (aye)

Trapping, wrapping up the fungus (trappin', wrappin')
My niggas came from nothing (nothing)

I’m having bricks in all of my houses (I'm havin' bricks)
I make a public announcement
I’m getting money while you niggas lousy (money)
Shoot a nigga with a rocket like Lowry
Wipe a nigga’s nose like I use Bounty
Quicker picker upper, you a sucker
Cut his body up then drop it in the bowl (cut it)
I got a white ho speaking Russian (white)
Sad to say you niggas drinking ‘Tussin
Give me my dab, I’m taking custody (dab)
Hop out the Lam and start bustin’ (baow)
You want your ho back but she stuck to me (aye)
RIP Mike and then Pistol Pete (RIP)
New to you, but it’s old to me (old to me)
Walking in flames, I can’t see my feet (no)
All of you niggas want to be like me (be like me)
The radio sounding like mini-me’s
Take a knee, you need to honor me (take a knee)

Skating on ice but I’m not with the Mighty Ducks (ice)
When I pour they say I pour too much (Act')
Who the fuck said they get high as us? (who?)

These niggas drinking on Robitus’
Give ‘em the bubble guts, serving detention bus
I put that bitch on the perk, she can’t get enough
Got these bitches playing double dutch (aye)
Put that dick in her mouth, tell her pucker up
Catch you biting the dab, you get sucker punched (baow)
After I fuck that bitch once, then punt
Ain’t no going out for lunch (nah)
I told these niggas ‘bout flipping and whipping the chickens
They say I ain’t give ‘em none (who?)
I gave these niggas the flow that they using
And niggas they act like I owe ‘em some
My plug he just touched down in Lebanon
He teach me the game like he Farrakhan
When you see 12 you supposed to run (12)
Ain’t no James Bond, got the golden gun (graow)
Tonight we gon’ fuck up Aroma (what else?)
Leave that and walk into Mansion
Go grab a chicken, plate from Cheetah's (Cheetah)
Or fuck it, I might just hit Magic (Magic)
Big booty thot, she was a pornstar (booty)
Rose gold collection for the rose bar (rose gold)
Now I might black out and talking ‘bout really
My double cup filled with that bar (Actavis)
Your ho wanna fuck, I don’t want her (aye)
Popped a perky, I’m geeked in Aroma (perky)
