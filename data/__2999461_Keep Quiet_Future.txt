From the club to the telly, on the floor
You better not wake the neighbors
You better not wake them neighbors, girl

Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
Don't tell nobody
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
'Cause you gon' start a riot
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
Don't tell nobody
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
'Cause you gon' start a riot

Fell in love, she done got attached
Let her tell it, we a perfect match
Go to Paris, do the dashboard
See the wheel on the right side
Got her driving on the wrong side
Thought we was driving on the wrong side
Out the country for a couple months
I gotta keep the goons all in line
Hotel lobby like a club, got me drinkin' on raw wine
Steaks and shrimps on your plate, baby
We can chop it up, but I ain't wine and dine
Rude girl, you the right sign
You the right kind, this the right time
We can kick it off and go to Iceland
You see they bitin' like Tyson
VVS' wasn't given to me
And them skirts, I'ma give 'em to you
No confessions, you can book the suite
I might even let you book the villa
Po' me up and let me get right
Chains swinging, this a pair of ice
Maintain, go to paradise
I'ma send for you, book the last flight
You might also like
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
Don't tell nobody
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
'Cause you gon' start a riot
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
Don't tell nobody
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
'Cause you gon' start a riot

Braless swag is complementary
Audemars is confidential
Credit card, expensive dinners
Let you cruise the double M
Like you signed to Maybach dem
If you run across my BM, better not throw no bloodshed
Better not cut no fuss at them
Better look the other way, I know you fuckin' him
You gotta let me have my way, that's why I trust in you
Presidential suite, baby
You gon' be there for me, yeah yeah
Your girlfriends always hatin'
You richer than them, that's real facts
I keep you fly, that's real facts
I get you high and a little upset
These niggas, they small talkin'
I bet they never cut a real check
Stay in the mall, flossin'
You ain't never been late on a bill yet
My name come with all these benefits
If you fuck a nigga who famous, you better
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
Don't tell nobody
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
'Cause you gon' start a riot
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
Don't tell nobody
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
'Cause you gon' start a riot

From the club to the telly, on the floor, on the table
You better not wake them neighbors
You better not wake them neighbors, girl
Keep quiet 'cause you gon' start a riot
Keep quiet 'cause you gon' start a riot2Embed
