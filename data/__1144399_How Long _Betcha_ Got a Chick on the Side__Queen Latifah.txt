1 ContributorHow Long (Betchaâ€™ Got a Chick on the Side) LyricsBetcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you want us both and I know the reason why
I can give you so much lovin
But presents, she can buy you
Last night youre in my arms
Tonight Im all alone

How long will this game go on? How long?
Oh, oh how long?
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side
And its plain, plain enough to see that
Youre not the man for me
I can't keep playin games that keep my heart in pain
I want to turn and walk away but its harder to do
Than it is to say

It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure
Ill get over you, yes Ill find someone new
Each time I open up my heart
It seems to just get torn apart
You might also like
I saw you, dont you try to hide
Dont hide it from me, no, no. no

You thought you would hide it, hide it
Hide it from me

Yeah, check you out
I bet you thought I didn't know a daggone thing
I bet you thought you had me fooled, didn't you?
I know you got a chick on the side
My sisters saw you with her
So did my cousin
She sent a picture to my cellphone
I saw the video on YouTube
My other sister saw you too!
My niece even saw you with her!Embed
