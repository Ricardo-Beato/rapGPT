Lord, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, oh, lift me up
Lord, lift me up, I've had enough
I've had too much
Too much, I don't seem to do much
Too much, I don't seem to do nothin'
Lord, lift me up, oh, lift me up
Lift me up, oh, lift me up
Lord, lift me up, lift me up
Oh, lift me up, lift me, lift me up

I pray what you wanted to be
Just takin' whatever You wanted from me
It turns out I want it to me
I'll take You wherever You wanted to be
The burden is all on to me
You're givin' them just what they wanted to see
They wanna see the family feud
But I can't let the family lose
They strugglin', like back and forth, like me and you

Oh, Lord, I call on You to
Lift me up, oh, lift me up, oh, lift me up
Oh, Lord, I call on You to
You might also like
No strings attached, that's Bluetooth
That's you, too, sorry, sorry, true6Embed
