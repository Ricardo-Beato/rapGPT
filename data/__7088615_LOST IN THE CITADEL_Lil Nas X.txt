Tell me, are you feeling down?
Are you happy, do your dreams still seem inbound?
Tell me, are we finished now?
'Cause every time you leave, you find a way to come back around

I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more

My God, you're an angel
I only see you in your halo
I was hopin' we could stay close
But we no longer sing the same notes

I rеmember when I mеt you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you were someone I could vent to
So I hit your line, what you getting into?

I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more
You might also like
Why I thought it was forever?
I only see you, maybe, never
Why I thought we'd be together?
When you treat it like whatever? Yeah, yeah, yeah
My love for falling down
Playing the victim when all my envisionings
Come slowly tumblin' down
Putting me back on the ground

I remember when I met you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you were someone I could vent to
So I hit your line, what you getting into?

I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more

Tell me, are you feeling down?
Are you happy, do your dreams still seem inbound?
Tell me, are we finished now?
'Cause every time you leave, you find a way to come back around21Embed
