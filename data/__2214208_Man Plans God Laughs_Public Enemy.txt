God damn, damn man
Man laughs at Godâ€™s plan
God laughs at man's trash
Man plans, God laughs

Let it be, what it is
Fight the power for the kids
Who don't know, you may ask yourself
Figured out
Bad news is bad news
The damn plan got you confused
Hood news, no good news
Ghettoburbs, see em as views

Am I a radical?
Am I a radical?
Am I a radical?
Am I a radical?
Am I a radical?
Am I a radical?
Am I a radical?
Am I a radical?
Am I a radical?
Am I a pacifist?
Am I scared to fight?
I ain't askin' you
Am I grown?
Do I stand up?
Am I owned?
You might also like
Let it be, speaking words
But no wisdom, make em dumb
Damn the plan that man made
Threw the monkey wrench
Praise their faves, what they gave
Get attention nowadays
It's the way they get paid
To get saved, pray to a stage

Do it for the culture, do it for the youth
Do it for the culture, do it for the youth
Do it for the culture, do it for the youth
Do it for the culture, do it for the youth

Am I a radical?
Am I a pacifist?
Am I scared to fight?
I ain't askin' you
Am I grown?
Do I stand up?
Am I owned?

Be the change you wanna see
And wanna be, let it be
Revolution, what it is
Bring the noise
'89 another summer
We to me, we to me
'89 another summer
We to me, we to me
Do it for the youth
Do it for the youth
Do it for the youth
Do it for the youth
Do it for the youth1Embed
