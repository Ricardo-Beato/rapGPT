206 ContributorsI. Crawl Lyrics
Say it (Hit 'em), goddamn!
(Hit 'em) Goddamn! (Hit 'em) Goddamn!
Say it, Lord (Hit 'em), goddamn! Yeah
(Hit 'em) Goddamn! (Watch it, hit 'em)

Where, where, where, where
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone

(Who am I?)
Rec League, I ain't paying to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah, I murder some, murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah, what you saying to it?
Old money look, no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ie
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her booty) What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke niggas when they Black and mild
So we act it out—okay, cool
You might also like
Where, where, where, where
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Blue dream by the bouquet
'Til I'm blue-faced on a Tuesday-day-day-day-day
Can I have some? #NiggasBeLike
Put a +18 on an e-vite
And I said what I felt, no re-write
Nah, nah, they can't hold me
June, July—drop something
I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers
I scorch winters, I burn autumns
Gut niggas, so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
Too true like it's 2 Chainz
Blue blood like he both gangs
Where, where, where
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, where, where

Fire! Fire! (Hit 'em) Goddamn
(Hit 'em) Goddamn! (Hit 'em) Goddamn!
Where, where, where, where
Fire! (Hit 'em) Goddamn!
(Give it to 'em) Goddamn! (Watch it)
Where, where, where, where

Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
