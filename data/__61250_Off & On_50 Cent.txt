10 ContributorsOff & On Lyrics
Sprinkle a little 2Pac on it (It ain't easy bein' me)
I'm legendary I'm necessary
They call me Ferrari they call me 50
Call me big homie
Hah

I got a bad bitch over the crib, I'm finna pop her off
Nigga call me in 30 I beat her and dropped her off
It's a quickie the ass and the lips are super soft
And to top it off, she topped me off
Niggas trynna front on my swag, knock it off
Put the strap to the back of your knot and knock it off
Homicide they have to come through, block it off
That's what they do after that choppa get to choppin' off (It ain't easy bein' me)
They say a nigga off, and think a nigga off
I'm on the runway one way takin' off
I tell a chick, pay a pimp, bitch, break it off
I smack a ho, that ain't shit bitch, shake it off (It ain't easy bein' me)

Off and on, these niggas be off and on
And it go (On and on and on)
And it go (On and on and on)
Off and on, me, I'm never off, I'm on
And it go (On and on and on)
And it go (On and on and on)
(It ain't easy bein' me)

Go 'head and ask about 50's Ferrari, I never take a loss
I'm a boss, tell niggas to let it off, set it off
Diamond cloth, flush lawn, it's floss at all costs
God damnit it all costs, get it now, half off (It ain't easy bein' me)
Diamond stud show off, nigga's swag is so off
They stunt till I go off, the 6 hour blow off
My wahi mahi-mahi teriyaki I'm so cocky
Who the fuck out here to stop me, nigga haters sit and watch me
And it seem like it is but it's not the same man niggas ain't got what I got my man
Got a flow so pure like brick cocaine nigga bitch wanna be my secret man
Freaky thing you eat that thing, every now and then I beat that man
She tell a nigga not to say a thing, but I can't keep a secret man (It ain't easy bein' me)

Off and on, these niggas be off and on
And it go (On and on and on)
And it go (On and on and on)
Off and on, me, I'm never off, I'm on
And it go (On and on and on)
And it go (On and on and on)
(It ain't easy bein' me)3Embed
