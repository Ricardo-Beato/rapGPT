8 ContributorsPreachinâ€™ to the Quiet Lyrics
The preacher has came to teach a new lesson
Preachment against the pregnancy
A new slammer.. and there's new vision often trys to capture
This rough and tough in this ghetto.. a lot of fruads stuff going down

Public Enemy...
We are.. gathering.. here.. today..
I'd like.. I'd like to introduce..
The incredible.. master beat..
D, the Enemy.. the hard rhymer

Celebrity, the new drug in America got to have it
Got to be it, so the young ones can see it
Watch out now! - look at here now!
In this 'Rich or Die Trying' times
Y'all see the greed I see?
Got these cats whipped by TV
Three generations of fatherless women
We're drowning instead of swimming
This ain't what y'all asked for
That's what they locked your ass up for
And they closed the door (COME ON!!)
Beyond these streets, these kids; they be always watching
See, it ain't been the same (DAMN!!)
Since teens summit left the game
Off the air, who cares?
Now, kids get progammed, ask their peoples
Who buy them almost everything the stars wear
People see, people do, y'all see the new pied pipers
They got to hold on you; back to the Boogaloo
Get a shot so you don't catch the flu
Don't get shot, and get a hole in you
Uhh.. (*Gunshot*)

Can I get a hittman?
Maybe I'm.. preaching to the quiet..

You see, I'm talking advanced but going back at the same time
Rewind.. so what? - some of this song don't rhyme
Like I said most of us get ghetto at the wrong time
Fear.. so leave a little room for God up in here
Back in the day, even real pimps, hustlers, players
Told young cats; COME ON!! get you lives on track
These raps you hear today, is a bad ass act
I'm here to tell it like it ought to be
It ain't no kids fault to me
35 years old acting sixteen, you know what I mean?
You don't work, mean you don't eat
You need more than a ball and some bomb ass beats
New kicks on your feet, you need your mind in this time to compete
Uhh.. make your world complete
Sweet not sour (Aiyyo, let me tell you the..)
That's why I call it Fighting the Power

YEAH!! YEAH!! YEAH!! YEAH!! Y'all!!

Yeah, look it here!!
And maybe I'm.. preaching to the quiet..
Hip-Hop ---------] Big Daddy Kane
Now, here it is, no fable, I put it all on the table
Spending my time identifying.. who's behind some of these labels
Who profit off the spit, some of the same way same cats
That owned them ships, yes, it's a business
But slavery was too prison industrial complex
New slavery looking up to own you
Owning the labels, stations, jails and cemeteries
Thug Life, turning Hip-Hop into a one Stop-Shop
Somebody behind making up your own damn mind
Signed, sealed, delivered in a nigga package so dumb
You can't hear the ignorace, protected by the backpacker
Who co-signed to say so, claiming they dug the flow
Filled with Jim Crow, return of the old Negro
How you going to say No To Drugs if you don't say No To Thugs?
See, the government sweep it deeper under the rug
Sweep it deeper under the rug, yeah, uhh..

Yo, COME ON!!
Yo, COME ON!!
Yo, COME ON!!
Yo, COME ON!!

Maybe.. I'm preaching to the quiet
Maybe I'm.. Maybe I'm.. preaching to the quiet
Uhh.. look it here..
I hear you talking, I hear you talking
Talk your talk, walk your walk
Talk your talk, walk your walk
Look it here.. I'm preaching to the quiet
Yeah, GET IT NOW!! GET IT!! GET IT!!
GET IT NOW!! YO!!
UHH!! COME ON!! WHAT!!
GET IT NOW!! GET IT!!
RIOT!! IS GOING DOWN!!
YEAH!! LOOK OUT!!
