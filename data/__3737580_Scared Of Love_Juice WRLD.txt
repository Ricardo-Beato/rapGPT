Ooh, ooh, woah
I never been scared
I tell you that I don't care
Really, I do care
I hope that you care (Yuh hear mi now, Mitch Mula?)
I never been scared to love (Drop dat bomboclaat)

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not gettin' enough
You're way too much, still not gettin' enough

You're way too much, too, too much
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
So I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked up
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder, if I can pick my heart out my chest (Out my chest)
Lately I been feelin' the worst (Feelin' the worst)
So I gotta dress like the best (So I gotta dress like the best)
Moncler all on my chest (All on my chest)
VVS all on my neck (All on my neck)
Ballin' like a fucking upset (Upset)
They're beyond stressed (Stressed)
I been hurt but I'm beyond that
You might also like
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not gettin' enough
You're way too much, still not gettin' enough

We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell? (Tell)
As far as I can tell, you're the only heaven here
I'm runnin' out of Xans, runnin' out of options
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay
I know I been dead for a minute now
Ain't wanna be alive, no way (Mula tell 'em fall through)

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not gettin' enough
You're way too much, still not gettin' enough (No, I'm not gettin' enough)45Embed
