Yeah!
Don Corleone, Mad Cheetah!
They can't fuck with that!
When I come through niggas be like "Is that God?!"

I parked a Wraith on the sidewalk - did it for Brooklyn!
That AR getting let off - did it for Brooklyn!
Givenchy off of gift cards - did it for Brooklyn!
In any city I rep hard - did it for Brooklyn!

Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for BK!
Did it for Kings County
All of the PJ's!
Did it for Brooklyn

Did it for Gates Ave
Did it for Nostrand
How about the white Lam?
Leave it on Fulton
Shout out to Fort Greene
What up to Crown Heights
My bitch went to Barney's
Killed it with one swipe
Shout out to Lafayette Gardens
I did it for Marcy and Tompkins
Shit'll get real if you in the Ville
 Killing and robbing
Pulled up on Patchen in a new Aston
Parked it in front of the store
Jumped out with one of the Braxtons
Hustle for dear life
Niggas that's like us
Get money and get fly
Blow it in Club Lust
Balling I can't help it
Wheelie with no helmet
All of my niggas felt it
Came for the crown and held it

Treat the Maybach like a Honda coupe - did it for Brooklyn!
Throwing hundreds up out the roof - did it for Brooklyn!
Birkin bag like a hundred large - did it for Brooklyn!
In any city I rep hard - did it for Brooklyn!

Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for BK!
Did it for Kings County!
All of the PJ's!
Did it for Brooklyn!

Bitch so bad motherfuckers wanna clone me
That shit cray
Pussy so good motherfuckers wanna own me
And that shit cray
I can see the hate through the Dita frames
And that shit shady
I know stand-up niggas in a wheelchair
Shout out my nigga A (A!)
Kim come through in that pink mink, pink pussy, pink hair
He said my ass like a five-star, restaurant he wanna eat there
First bitch in that GT, I did it for Brooklyn
Big named me Queen Bee, he did it for Brooklyn
I show love, I don't hate bitches
Make shoes out you snake bitches
Dress the same but we taste different
Protein, shake bitches
Blue Wraith up in the pink houses
These yellow diamonds ain't never cloudy
K.O.B. I keep kings around me
Only queen in the King's County
I parked a Wraith on the sidewalk - did it for Brooklyn!
That AR getting let off - did it for Brooklyn!
Birkin bag like a hundred large - did it for Brooklyn!
In any city I rep hard - did it for Brooklyn!

Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for Brooklyn (did it for Brooklyn)
Did it for BK!
Did it for Kings County!
All of the PJ's!
Did it for Brooklyn!
All of the PJ's!
