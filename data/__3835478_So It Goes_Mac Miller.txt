*Dog barking*
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, um
(What?) Yeah
('Sup?) Well

You could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em, "Red light, stop it"
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics

There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot of dreamin'
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even
Hmm, I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall
The grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
But somebody gotta do it (It gets so exhausting)
Often with the bullshit, and, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up
Yeah
You might also like
Okay, well, you could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
So it goes
It's like, in every conversation, we the topic
This narcissism, more like narcotics
So it goes

Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standin', sit down
Whoa-oh
And I know I been out (And I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (But now I'm back in town), so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes (Ya! So it goes)
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes
Well, this is a special delivery, comin' to you live with the
Endless artillery, always down to ride
My eyes on the enterprise
Nine lives, never die, fuck a Heaven, I'm still gettin' high
Never mind, did I mention I'm fine?
'Cause her pussy gettin' wetter when the weather dry
Clementine, peelin' off and everyone get left behind
I'm only 5'7'' 'cept I'm feelin' like I'm 7'5"
Damn it, cross planets, interstellar
Never land, not a Jackson, packed with action
So what's happenin', my man?
No relaxin', kickin' back, this ain't exactly in the plan
I can't get no satisfaction, goddamn
They sayin' I been gone too long
I could just tell 'em, "Fuck you," but that come on too strong
My God, it go on and on
Just like a circle, I go back where I'm from
Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standin', sit down
Whoa-oh
And I know I been out (And I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (But now I'm back in town), so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes (Ya! So it goes)
La-da-da-da, da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, da-da-da
So it goes
