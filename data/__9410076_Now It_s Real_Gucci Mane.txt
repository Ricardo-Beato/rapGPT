10 ContributorsNow Itâ€™s Real Lyrics
Uh-huh

I could've been in prison with a hundred years
Yet I woke up in a mansion with two hundred mill' (Huh)
Had to let go of the lean and get off the pills (The lean)
Cut a couple niggas off 'cause they didn't keep it real (Fuck 'em)
My life is beautiful like Snoop Dogg and Pharrell (Pharrell)
Used to dream of livin' like that, but now it's real (It's real)
Remember I was sellin' Ps like that rip, for real (For real)
Now I play this shit right, I retire with a bill' (A bill)

My car, it cost two million, my watch cost a ticket (What the fuck?)
Worth a quarter billion now, and now I'm talkin' liquid (You lyin')
I'm hurtin' these haters feelings, mama said I'm gifted (My mama)
They say my label cursed, I guess the curse lifted (It's lifted)
My coupe an immigrant, it ain't even shipped (It's shipped)
I wired half a milli' when it first was built (This shit built)
I never been a snitch, that's not how I was built (Nah)
On a mission in a hotbox with the column peeled (Peeled)
Cut from a different cloth, this a whole 'nother quilt
I got so many whips, could start a dealership (A dealership)
They all delusional, I never needed them (Fuck 'em)
I'm like the Godfather, help the needy ones (The needy ones)
These niggas got no motion 'cause they greedy bums (They bums)
A Sun Valley alum', product of the slums (The 6)
They treat me like the Don 'cause I'm one of the ones (The one)
You niggas don't shoot guns, y'all just bumpin' your gums
You might also like
I could've been in prison with a hundred years
Yet I woke up in a mansion with two hundred mill' (Huh)
Had to let go of the lean and get off the pills (The lean)
Cut a couple niggas off 'cause they didn't keep it real (Fuck 'em)
My life is beautiful like Snoop Dogg and Pharrell (Pharrell)
Used to dream of livin' like that, but now it's real (It's real)
Remember I was sellin' Ps like that rip, for real (For real)
Now I play this shit right, I retire with a bill' (Go)

Everyone obsessed with drillin', I don't wanna drill (Yeah)
Young nigga, take it from me, that ain't how to live (Live)
Used to have to make a sale just to pay the bills (Damn)
I don't like to even reminisce, it give me chills (Brr)
My car look like a fish out of land without the gills (Woah)
My roof so tall, my lil' boy damn near can't fit in the wheels (Ice)
Used to have to bring the cash, now I cut the check (Check)
Used to wake up in a cell, now I'm on a jet (Jet)
Used to have to pay the plate with nowhere to stay (Nowhere to stay)
Nigga keep lookin' for Ray, he done took the yay (Pioom)
I done stacked so many Ms, I had to move away (I'm gone)
R.I.P. my daddy, he wouldn't put the booze away (R.I.P. my daddy)
I know we all gon' make mistakes, this shit make or break (Or break)
I spent a million dollars on it, but still lost the case (What the fuck?)
I got a loyal fanbase, they won't go away (My fans)
These folks still listen to me, each and every single day (It's Gucci)
I could've been in prison with a hundred years
Yet I woke up in a mansion with two hundred mill' (Huh)
Had to let go of the lean and get off the pills (The lean)
Cut a couple niggas off 'cause they didn't keep it real (Fuck 'em)
My life is beautiful like Snoop Dogg and Pharrell (Pharrell)
Used to dream of livin' like that, but now it's real (It's real)
Remember I was sellin' Ps like that rip, for real (For real)
Now I play this shit right, I retire with a bill'Embed
