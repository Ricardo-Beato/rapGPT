5 ContributorsNever Gonna Give it Up Lyrics
Man, we love you man, you hear me?
This is coming from the General man, Nas man
Bravehearts love you man, this is to all of ya niggas
Who been using my name from day one to make yourselves famous
Whether you shouting me out on your records
Whether you try to come at me on your records, or whether you just you know...?
You know... you know how you dick riding man? This goes out to ya
Cause we love you man, I've done made a lot of niggas famous man
But I'm gon' make you...I make you make the papers, this one's for you
Ayo, word up
It been a lot of times when a nigga ain't wanna fuck with this rap shit no more
Fuck this shit, but you know...? Through the year I started to see shit, you knowamsayin?
Nigga see niggas driving around with fancy cars, diamonds, all that shit
Niggas thinking a nigga chilling
Got to go through a whole bunch of big shit, all that bullshit
But you know what? Fuck that shit, you know how I feel? Yo

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's the life baby, you gots to understand it's life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's the life baby, you gots to understand it's life baby
You might also like
I got the mansion and the nice ride
Platinum chain, and an ice watch
All this fame in my life's hard
I entertain in so many places
See so many different faces
They look the same from the stages
After the concert, hours of long work
Home sick from the road, smoking my lungs hurt
Even though now I'm recording songs
It's better than, when I was peddling, doing wrong
I brought the crew along, we thugging
Fucking married bitches; they go to their husbands
Bitches ain't shit, we laughing with them
Can't even role the streets now, without the heat
I bust the nigga off impost, that shit is weak
On trial, what I'ma tell the judge
He don't give me no smile, he don't give me no love, nor the jury
That's when I need celeb status and the blackness
This motherfucker's hate rappers, what a life

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
My girl hate when I'm with my boys
Think I'm cheating, every morning knocking at my door
State policeman, give him a reason, but I don't give it to him
They said they heard a disturbance, and I just listen to him
See, I cooperate until they push me
Cops hate when you know the law, you ain't pussy
You not fake, can't explain how much I miss the block
When we was slinging with my niggas, screaming "Fuck the cops!"
Now when I'm dreaming I can see my dead friends smile
Wake up, I get some air, hit the mall for a while - pick up some gear
I'm going to the studio; my engineer put the track up from "out west"
And he told me spit it clear
Another hit just made, another album
So ones again we getting paid, and now we wilding
Get hype to shoot the video, all in the city yo
I'm hoping that a nigga blow, but ya don't hear me though

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
The haters say I ain't shit
Hope I fall, but I can't slip
Got to ball, got to bank chips
Old ladies hate my moms cause their kids ain't amount to nothing
Catch my moms on the bench fronting
I got to stay awake, got to pray today
Glad I'm still alive, fuck what them haters say
So many times I ain't wanna rhyme
Wanted a normal life where I ain't Nas all the time
So many problems too, do what I got to do
As long as my moms say, "Boy, I'm proud of you"
I keep laying hits, winners never quits
Plus if I stop, how would I stay legit?

I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's my life baby, you gots to understand my life babyEmbed
