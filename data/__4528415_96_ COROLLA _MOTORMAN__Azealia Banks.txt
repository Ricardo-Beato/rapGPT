9 Contributors96’ COROLLA (MOTORMAN) LyricsAre you ready for me to destroy you?
I don't think you’re ready for this danger
Hey girl, hey skinny modern alien
You tripped on a needle and found you a motorman
He's got a space suit, rocket to the space coup...
Shift it in gear then out through the stratosphere!
He's gonna cage you, try to re-create you, he’s re-p-til-lian
I don't think you understand!
I tried to save you, now I must erase you....
Spatial race, a rocket to erasure
Another billion
I'll cut your throat again
(He'll) Cage you, rape you
I'll eviscerate you...You might also likeEmbed
