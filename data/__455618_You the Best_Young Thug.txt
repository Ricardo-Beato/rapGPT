14 ContributorsYou the Best Lyrics
I'm swaggin', nigga
, what up, bro, you know?
I got them folks, I got you, nigga

You the best, you the best, yeah
Tell 'em you don't want a baby
Foreign clothes at Lennox, you own all the ladies
Real gold got me swaggin' like I’m in the '80s
Oh my God, oh my God, you the best, yeah
Tell 'em you don't want a baby
Foreign clothes at Lennox, you own all the ladies
Real gold got me lookin' like I’m from the '80s
Oh my God, oh my God

That butt sit out like a broken thumb
Got Tums, got sons, we can go meet moms
My swag worth a milli', I'ma blood, I want a billi'
These hoes tear me down, they wanna sue my businesses
I'ma be right to , these naked pics to my iPhone
I nut on you, you nut on me, let bygones be bygones
What you tryna be? What you tryna see?
Young Thugger packing that python
And my phone off, I'm at home
Keep  up for the clones
No, that girl got Georgia Dome
Bone, you know she in for some
And every time I see her I wish my old lady could be her
And ain’t no kin to Wayne but she is my mamacita
You might also like
You the best, you the best, yeah
Tell 'em you don't want a baby
Foreign clothes at Lennox, you own all the ladies
Real gold got me swaggin' like I’m in the '80s
Oh my God, oh my God, you the best, yeah
Tell 'em you don't want a baby
Foreign clothes at Lennox, you own all the ladies
Real gold got me lookin' like I’m from the '80s
Oh my God, oh my God
