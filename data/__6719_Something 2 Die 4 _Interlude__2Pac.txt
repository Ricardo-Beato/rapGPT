(laughter echoes)
I' changed?...
You motherfuckers kill me....
I've changed
It ain't that I've changed
But it's strange how you motherfuckers rearrange
When I found fame
Point ya finger at the bad guy!
You know what my momma used to tell me
If ya can't find something to live for...
...then you BEST, find something to die for
(Curtis Mayfield: "If there's hell below, we're all gonna go!")
(*repeat the above throughout*)
Deep deep
La'tasha Harlins, remember that name...
'Cause a bottle of juice... it's not something to die for
Young Quaid, remember that name...
'Cause all you motherfuckers
That go to your grave with that name on your brain
'Cause jealousy and recklessness is NOT, something to die for

Look how the cracker crumbles
When I say 'all you niggas' (All you niggas)
Unite
One nigga, teach two niggas
Four niggas teach more niggas
All the poor niggas
The pen' niggas
The rich niggas
The strong niggas
UNITE
There's more of us than there is of them
Look around...
Check your strip
Deep deep
That's something to die for
Black
That's something to live for
