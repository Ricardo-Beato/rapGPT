I'm feelin so Gucci, got back on my old Gucci
You know that stove music, trap boys sellin' wholes to it
Don't get exposed to it, might make you put your nose to it
Might kick your door and make you strip same way them hoes do it
I'm feelin so Gucci got work yeah its so Gucci
You know that stove music, trap boys sellin wholes to it
Don't get exposed to it, might make you put your nose to it
Might kick your door and make you strip same way them hoes do it

(BRICK SQUAD!)
.223 hanging with the 50 clip
51 and 50 mama don't know u fuckin wit
Whole clique strapped up I ain't never bump like this before say fuck Gucci and I'm kickin down yo mama door
The step child of hip hop
U can call me gangsta-hop
Whole clique gangsta out
They prayin' that to gangsta Flock
Soowoo to my bloods and bump this shout out to the west
Money over bitches so i put on my chest
North side Jamaica queens you can call that shit my stompin' grounds
Get yo ass stomped out pistol whipped or beat down
Pass that white sheet now bet that boy sleep now
Gucci Mane and Flocka you call that shit the A town
You might also like
I'm feelin so Gucci, got back on my old gucci
You know that stove music, trap boys sellin' wholes to it
Don't get exposed to it, might make you put your nose to it
Might kick your door and make you strip same way them hoes do it
I'm feelin so Gucci got work yeah its so Gucci
You know that stove music, trap boys sellin wholes to it
Don't get exposed to it, might make you put your nose to it
Might kick your door and make you strip same way them hoes do it

Rap game in a suplex, trappin' outta duplex
Workin' with the work ain't talkin bout bo-flex
Fishscale flake, iced out my rolex
Call me a landlord cause this my complex
Standin' by the pot right there where it go at
3 months, still ain't bought no clothes yet
No sofa, no bed or hoe yet
Everyday all day standin' where the dope at
Talkin' to the plug like homie where the blow at
Georgia where the Sun, East Atlanta where the snow at
100 to the lawyer, ain't even been to court yet
Dope like enough ain't even hit it with the fork yet
Stove work good, but the A/C bullshit
Dread head young boys waitin' on the door kick
Six thou' Zone 6 smokin' on a good shit
Gucci Mane out and he back on some kush shit
Junkie at the door and he really dont want shit
Feds tappin' lines who you talkin' on the phone with
Still' cookin' up early 5 in the morning
Workable pay fee nigga like Shoney's
Price go up, blow up in the drought
Green comin' in soft white going out
Trapping my style ain’t never going out
Work stocked up we ain’t never runnin’ out
I'm feelin so Gucci, got back on my old gucci
You know that stove music, trap boys sellin' wholes to it
Don't get exposed to it, might make you put your nose to it
Might kick your door and make you strip same way them hoes do it
I'm feelin so Gucci got work yeah its so Gucci
You know that stove music, trap boys sellin wholes to it
Don't get exposed to it, might make you put your nose to it
Might kick your door and make you strip same way them hoes do it

Stove music homie, don’t you confuse it
Lames gone cop it these boys gone abuse it
Niggas seen me hustle, niggas know I robbed
Niggas know I fucked with Gucci n them Bricksquad
Say I’m chopper dumb, still I’m street smart
Say I’m fool bout the money, sprayin’, retard
My chain like the yellow bus, that bitch cheesy
That boy might need some thuraflu
His ice game got him sneezin'
Soft like tissue, its expensive
Whole thang cost you 20 grand
Hot like an Audi hundred rounds let em know that I ain’t playin'
Back on my old shit, back with my old bitch
Cocaine crazy, back on my stove shit
I'm feelin so Gucci, got back on my old gucci
You know that stove music, trap boys sellin' wholes to it
Don't get exposed to it, might make you put your nose to it
Might kick your door and make you strip same way them hoes do it
I'm feelin so Gucci got work yeah its so Gucci
You know that stove music, trap boys sellin wholes to it
Don't get exposed to it, might make you put your nose to it
Might kick your door and make you strip same way them hoes do it1Embed
