21 ContributorsDrive Itself Lyrics
All white crib with the money counter sittin' on the white counter baby, yeah
DY Krazy
All foreign whips, all foreign bitches sittin' in the driveway, yeah

You pretend like you ain't that nigga when you that nigga
Try and pretend like my Maybach ain't bigger
Paid the extra ten just to get the Porsche delivered, yeah
Abide pains, now I gotta hold it down for my niggas, yeah
I do Paris fashion, front row only drug dealers, yeah
I'd be glad to pass that lil' ho off to my niggas, yeah
This Paris fashion, front row, when I dress, I ain't never left
I got the newest, latest Maybach, this bitch can drive itself

You a real rider, you a rider, shoot the chopper with your left
There some solid guys on the other side tryna get us there
Got her naked dancin', hide the Draco, she ain't playin' fair
She got two personalities, I got two Percs on me
I'm bumpin' 500 Degreez, this what work on me
Too many problems with these freaks, can't let it work on me
I seen it first hand before it's holdin' you back
I let the first ho I fell in love with play with these sacks
Started going crazy off of that pot, drinkin' that Act'
Start to have a whole lot stacks on me, servin' that crack
I done seen a whole lot of niggas make it, they ain't get jack for it
I done had the same mentality, every sentence, I trap for it
You might also like
You pretend like you ain't that nigga when you that nigga
Try and pretend like my Maybach ain't bigger
Paid the extra ten just to get the Porsche delivered, yeah
Abide pains, now I gotta hold it down for my niggas, yeah
I do Paris fashion, front row only drug dealers, yeah
I'd be glad to pass that lil' ho off to my niggas, yeah
This Paris fashion, front row, when I dress, I ain't never left
I got the newest, latest Maybach, this bitch can drive itself

We pretend we ain't some killers but them killers know
We laughin' at your funeral but you don't get the joke
She actin' like she beautiful, she need an actin' coach
You niggas actin' like some dicks but y'all some camel toes, bump, bump
My new car drive itself but my lil' homie drove
I let these bitches drive they self and down a lonely road
I got 'em playin' with they self when I be on the road
It's that Cali weed, I smell, you hit it on the nose
She take D and not the L, yeah, that's some smarter hoes
HNDRXX on her audio, do cardio to Carter IV
Yeah, th-that new car drive itself, I'm gettin' head in traffic, uh
Voice activated navi', I just say the addy, gone
I'ma ball out, she pay for her own season tickets, oh, yeah
The car drive itself and pay for its own speedin' tickets, goddamn
I do Tampa with the street skaters, only street niggas
And me, I'm self-motivated and self-centered and self-driven, that's power steerin' it
You pretend like you ain't that nigga when you that nigga
Try and pretend like my Maybach ain't bigger
Paid the extra ten just to get the Porsche delivered, yeah
Abide pains, now I gotta hold it down for my niggas, yeah
I do Paris fashion, front row only drug dealers, yeah
I'd be glad to pass that lil' ho off to my niggas, yeah
This Paris fashion, front row, when I dress, I ain't never left
I got the newest, latest Maybach, this bitch can drive itself

Started goin' crazy off of that pot, drinkin' that Act'
Start to have a whole lot stacks on me, servin' that crack
I done seen a whole lotta niggas make it, they ain't get jack for it
I done had the same mentality, every sentence, I trap for it5Embed
