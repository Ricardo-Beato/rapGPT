1 Contributor.Wav(y) Lyrics
Didn't fuck with me then but its like they feeling me lately
(Feeling me lately)
Think I stacked all this change just to put a couple rocks on AP?
(No way)
The season of favors is over, got me like fuck you pay me
(Fuck you)
Right now the season of flavours and the whole gang looking wavy (Yeah)
 From head to creps a man's wavy (Waves)
Man I catch waves not feelings (uh) ain't a girl in this world that can play me (No way)
 Everybody inside get Wavy (Yeah)
Ride the wave till I'm sea sick, even the doctor couldn't save me
(Nah nah)

I might come in with the crew (Hey hey hey ey ey)
Like pirates running to the loot (Ey)
Come like curry with the hoops (Yeah)
We can rock boy or my block boys can pull up on you with the shoot (Look alive boy)
Round here they let guns clap (Boop boop boop)
So don't talk the talk if you don't does that (Don't talk that talk)
Get caught caught lacking they'll stick you up like a thumbtack
(Hah)
So I roll around with a pack of lions call me Mustafa like I'm young Raj (Mustafa)
I be prepared for the heat wave (Yeah yeah)
So I ain't got time for the he says she says (No time)
Everybody's switching sides I don't know who to fuck with these days (I don't)
Cos homies are phony like Bak Chor Mee at BK (Ahaha)

When I stand with the squad can't pepper what I got man's seasoned (Man's seasoned)
Keep pushing your luck boy I beg you give man a reason
(Give man a reason)
I can't be scared of no fuckboi my whole city like Yishun (Woo)
Man a London boy we ain't fucking about (Fucking about)
Didn't rate back then but they loving us now (Loving us now)
When we step in the place bet they fuck with the sound

All these fake friends know that I'm cutting them out
(Cutting them out)
Man say fuck the olders standard (Standard)
Cos we all young and reckless (Reckless)
Guess them man there can't stand us (Stand us)
When I step in the spot it's a madness (Yeah)
With the art that I make go hard in the paint till I leave my mark on canvas

Didn't fuck with me then but its like they feeling me lately

Think I stacked all this change just to put a couple rocks on AP?
