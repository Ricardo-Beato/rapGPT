Mama, I'm in love with a hot girl, and they just don't get it
They just don't get it
Temperature's risin', her body yearnin', yeah, we on that R. Kelly
And then she tell me

Let's start a fire, you'll be my lighter
Baby, I'll be your gasoline (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire, watch the entire
World, as it opens up in flames (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire (Yeah, Mickey and Mallory)
Let's start a fire (Yeah, Bonnie and Clyde, Thelma and Lil Weezy)
Let's start a fire
Let's start a fire-ire-ire

I'm like goodness gracious, great wall of China
All we do is fuck all day, all ma√±ana
It's a cold world, I stay warm inside her
Make her perspire, sweat, blood, and crying
Goodness gracious, great God almighty
She fuck me like a king, Stephen, Martin, Rodney
We break all of monotony, baby, we high commodity
And they just don't get it
You might also like
Let's start a fire, you'll be my lighter
Baby, I'll be your gasoline (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire, watch the entire
World, as it opens up in flames (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire (Me and you)
Let's start a fire (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire
Let's start a fire-ire-ire

Mama, I'm in love with a hot girl, and they just don't get it
They just don't get it
Temperature's risin', her body yearnin', yeah, we on that R. Kelly
And then she tell me (Let's start a fire)

Like goodness gracious, great balls of fire
She ridin' me like a street car named Desire
Stop, drop, roll, and shake what her mama gave her
Clap that ass like the choir
Oh, I ran into my old thing
I say, "Bitch, you broke my heart, but that's just growin' pains"
But trust me, she ain't nothing but an old flame
And I threw water on that old flame, no more flames
I'm so glad I'm out the dope game
'Cause now I got more time to burn in that pussy like some propane
Now that pussy is my domain
And I know they just don't get it, they just don't get it, yeah
Let's start a fire, you'll be my lighter
Baby, I'll be your gasoline
Let's start a fire, watch the entire
World, as it opens up in flames (And they just don't get it)
Let's start a fire (Fuck 'em, fuck it, they just don't get it, see we already, we already lit it)
Let's start a fire (And now we on fire, we on fire, yeah, it's me and you)
Let's start a fire (Just don't get it, we already, we already did it)
Let's start a fire-ire-ire (And now we on fire, we on fire, yeah)

Let's start a fire
Mama I'm in love with a hot girl, and they just don't get it
They just don't get it
Baby, I'll be your gasoline
Fuck it, 'cause Mama, I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it
Let's start a fire, watch the entire
World, as it opens up in flames
Fuck em', 'cause Mama, I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it
