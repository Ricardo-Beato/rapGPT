Sweet thing
You moved to Southern California, sweet thing
You do just what your parents told you, sweet thing
You're watching Parks and Rec alone, sweet thing
You sweet thing
Sweet thing
You'll end up being someone better, sweet thing
But I can only be myself, sweet thing
You'll still believe in fairytales, sweet thing
You sweet thing

You take me to the fair
But I don't really care
You wouldn't change a hair
Sometimes I wonder why you love me
But you love me
I always make you cry
No matter how I try
Sometimes I wonder why
Why would you ever want to love me?
Must you love me? Oh

Sweet thing
You made me chicken, rice, and beans, sweet thing
You're just as sweet as you can be, sweet thing (Oh, yeah)
If you wanna be happy, don't look at my phone, sweet thing
My sweet thing (Sweet thing)
Sweet thing
Your friend is always acting stank, sweet thing
You wanna hold me, but you can't, sweet thing
You always eating off my food, sweet thing
My sweet thing
You might also like
Ain't got no pictures on my feed
Gucci jacket smell like weed, ooh
Rubbing my head while we're both sleeping
Feel like I'm cheating on myself
But it feels so good
I wanna tell you something
Something I've never said before
I just wanna say

Thank you (Oh, yeah)
'Cause I love you, mmh, mmh
I wanna say thank you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I love you, ooh, yeah
I said thank you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I really love you, yeah (Thank you), ah
I said thank you
Thank you for showing me what love can be (I love you)
Thank you
Your love is a mountain
I admire
I admire, I admire
Oh, I said thank you
And I love you, yes, I do
And I love you, yes, I do
I said thank you (Woo)
Thank you for children
Thank you for your love
I said thank you
I admire, I admire
I just wanna say it, I had mine sad (Thank you)
I cannot find, I cannot find, losin' my mind
Losin' my mind14Embed
