2 ContributorsWe Do Lyrics
Hit em with this

I'm a bad muhfucka  not me
Fast with  you ain't seen it
Splash, get the money and dash
I pull through thoroughly where most men'll fail to
Then derail you
I'm on my own genetalia
No need crossing fingers
Done deal, it's a win
Like  I get's it in
I'ma pop my shot
Lean back on the block
I got two blue  and a badass ride
When the scene get hot
I'ma sling my shot
Always keep your shit hot
What you see in here now 

This is how we do
What we do
Where we do
What we do
We came to fuck shit up
This is how we do
What we do
Where we do
What we do
We came to fuck shit up


This is how we do
What we do
Where we do
What we do
We came to fuck shit up
This is how we do
What we do
Where we do
What we do
We came to fuck shit up
