Shawnna!
I think I got some problems, I can't even sidewalk
All I wanna do is listen to that Gucci 
Or that Gucci mixtape, put it in and hit play
Then get in my ride, in my ride, in my ride
Ain't nobody like me
We all be so icey
AKA gorillas we them killers in them white tees
You don't want no bullshit, we be on that bullshit
Like  we be on that bullshit
Put me in my 
And we gettin' money
I'm a Gucci zombie, he say I'm a junkie
Say I'm a junkie I'm a Gucci zombie
Cause my little nephew he wear Gucci on his onesie
Gucci on my bedsheets, Gucci on my car seats
Gucci on my carpet, I like Gucci on my perfume
Gucci in my bathroom, Gucci on my cat too
So in love with Gucci, I got Gucci on my tattoo

I got Gucci on my tiptoes
Gucci on my ringtone
I'm living so icey, I think Gucci is my theme song
Gucci on my duffle bag, and it hold a couple racks
Ask yourself a question, be like, "Can I "
Catch me at the Gucci store, 'bout to cop a Gucci coat
Top it with some Gucci shades, and rock it to the Gucci show
Don't you know I'm stupid though?
Jewelry got me 
So if you wanna know
We "that's so icey gang" that's 
 when it comes to rappin' shit
We be the original, and you are just a copy, bitch
It's obvious, bitches want to copy this
Thinkin' you the shit but when you 
Shawty  can not be this
Never be a Gucci girl
I envy on top of it
Welcome to my Gucci world
Bitch I go out shopping 
All I get is Gucci now
Cause doctor ain't no stopping it
I'm under a Gucci spell
Hell yeah where that Gucci?
Let me hear that Gucci
Please play that Gucci
Hell yeah where that Gucci?
Please play that Gucci
Let me hear that Gucci
Hell yeah where that Gucci?
Let me hear that Gucci
Please play that Gucci
Hell yeah where that Gucci

Gucci Mane he crazy, but that boy still my favorite
Got so much flavit, swag so persuasive
Club going mayhem, so icey fan mail
Gucci Mane outta jail, flexing in a yellow Lamb
Gucci ma move it (Gucci)
No she not a groupie
Stupid crazy booty
Gucci, Loui, boujie
She in love with who? Me
Gucci yours truly

She a Gucci zombie
Yeah a Gucci junkie
Magic City Monday
Me, her, throwing money
Gucci Mane her favorite
That boy drive her crazy

Swear no one replacin'
