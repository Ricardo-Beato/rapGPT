5 ContributorsGet it Anyway Lyrics
I'mma do my thing. let me tell you right now
'Cause I don't know any other way of living my life now
Some of you know the struggle, some of you live in a bubble
Some like you hustlin', some of you just looking for trouble
I don't follow or lead, tommorow's a dream
Pray to God to intervene on all the sorrow I've seen
You want out of here, you can leave when you wanna
Nothing can stop you, if that's your type of persona
Life is shorter now, don't make me say it ten times
I keep going for mine, even in the end times
I can beat the system, come on and say it with me
Show me some optimism, we can take over the city

This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway
You might also like(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway

There comes a time in your life you gotta go for yours
Staying paid is like the battle of forever more
I stay pedal to the metal, foot on the floor
Earn my keep on the streets, knocking down your doors
I'm by the dollar like everybody oughta be
Don't burn nobody and make the money honestly
Open your home with the internet technology
I get it anyway despite of the economy
See I ain't coughin' unless it makes a profit
I'm dropping this so hot shit like every day gossip
Regardless of the climate, I'm gonna get it everyday
Even if the bullets spray, I'm gonna get it anyway

This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway
(Sing) La la la la la
(You know we blazin up that) La la la la la
(All around the world) La la la la la
(My peoples getting money) La la la la la
(Let me hear you sing)
So let 'em hear us holla or we'll guide us by the collar
Making it harder for you, don't wanna make an honest dollar
You wanna sip a little to make your pain numb
Tippin' that bottle, got you forgettin' where you came from
But I'm the same one, where you think my name's from
I'mma keep it moving and never stop till the game's done
Forever we live it, forever we spit it
Remember the minute you witnessed the realest that ever did it
(Quit it)
Still I'm committed no matter what I hear from the critic
People can see through a gimmick, I'm putting on a clinic
We in troubled times, swerving through the double lines
You run ahead on collision course, now you served your time

This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma get it anyway
(Sing) La la la la la
(You know we blazin' up that) La la la la la

(Let me hear you sing) La la la la la
(You know we blazin' up that) La la la la la
