5 ContributorsPositive Space Lyrics
I must've fell off the face of the planet
Before I noticed you designated a space to drop the anchor
I never intended to take you for granted
I found the patterns in your fabric I just wanted to understand you
You put a collar on a dog named Bandit
You're following a dollar with your hands like a basket
And honestly it doesn't bother me I hope you catch it
'Cause I'm here to fix your congratulatory sandwich
You look frustrated and famished
Allocate some assets to evaluate the damages
Establish with your manager to ask if you can ask for a
Few vacation days to get your balancing act back together
But the journey is the bobber
It goes up and down like the mercury in the thermometer
Now maybe that was an iota too soon
But I love you all the way from Minnesota to the moon
Make party and inflate the balloon
You bent me up into the shape of a spoon
I'm from a gutter full of ordinary litter
Where we figured that the storm will come and push us towards the river
You might also likeThis ain't the underground this the compost
Stand and deliver call me Edward James Almost
Always appreciate the quintessentials
You rock over your vocals, I roll with these instrumentals
If you got a lot of voices in your vegetable
Avoid the noise that tries to poison your receptacles
I won't pretend to know how you define successful
But I still wish you all of the success though
And when I'm dead, I'm gonna haunt the stereo
Temporary resident extraterrestrial
Check with me later for my specialty flavors
On your turntables and your record players
