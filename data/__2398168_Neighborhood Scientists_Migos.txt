10 ContributorsNeighborhood Scientists Lyrics
No Limit soldier like Master P, all of my niggas they bout it
Molly, the percocets, xan, if you geekin we call that bitch Scotty
Experiment with all the drugs, I'm your neighborhood scientist
Experiment with all the drugs, I am your neighborhood scientist

Might pull up, a Maybach or Audi
My diamonds fighting Ronda Rousey
I'm sipping, I'm drinking, I'm drowsy (Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, drank)
I'm your neighborhood scientist, free my niggas in confinement, independent never signing(QC!)
Look at my dab that's a fool, 2k15 are my shoes
Bad bitches by the double, I just want one of the two
And I got propane in the booth, I spit that flame when I shoot
And I used to juug off the IPhones, and I used to trap off the boost
I used to kick in them doors for nothing, now all the hoes they want me for something
I got the formula whip it up, whip it up like I'm Professor Klump
My niggas? Got em out the slums
Pass a hundred to the bums
Living life like Donald Trump
Gave 100,000 to my mom

No Limit soldier like Master P, all of my niggas they bout it
Molly, the percocets, xan, if you geekin we call that bitch Scotty
Experiment with all the drugs, I'm your neighborhood scientist
Experiment with all the drugs, I am your neighborhood scientist
You might also like
Experimenting with the nonsense, I am your neighborhood scientist
 You might get slapped with the pistol, now I'm on the run they can't find me
Sent the shocker, junkies testing my dope, then get operated by the doctor
You need to stop flexing, I see right through you like a glass, I know that you's a impostor
Creep up in a helicopter with the chopper, he turning the block and wait for him then pop him
Plug said a extra hundred if I drop him, you know what that mean, they gone talk cuz I offed him
No Limit soldier like Master P, my niggas bout it, they taking em all for no bounty
(Aye, aye) Pull up in a Bentley with the windows tinted, smoking cookies on top of the mountain (Gas!)
I am your neighborhood drug dealer, ain't talking soap when I say I got Dove nigga
You the type of nigga drinking liquor, and I rather sip lean, I'm a mud sipper
 I won't budge nigga, since my first fund I could spend on drugs nigga
I finessed Aladdin for a rug nigga, since I met the socket I been the plug nigga (Naw Forreal)

No Limit soldier like Master P, all of my niggas they bout it
Molly, the percocets, xan, if you geekin we call that bitch Scotty
Experiment with all the drugs, I'm your neighborhood scientist
Experiment with all the drugs, I am your neighborhood scientist2Embed
