I don't even know what's goin' on no more
I don't even know what's happenin' man
Ain't no answers
I'ma figure some shit out though, Hit
You know? Yeah, yeah
Just tryna get my weight up
Tryna get all my watches in order
Get my safe up, get great

I'm twenty-one years past the 27 Club
It's like I went back into my past and then I sped it up
Robert Johnson, Winehouse and Morrison found where Heaven was
Heaven on Earth, this shit is magic with no fairy dust
Home of the gully, gangsta, the gruesome, and thе scary stuff
I told my brother Jung', "Fuck 'em, they gon' go through Hеll with us
They don't have the history in the streets that compare with us"
Hood niggas, they wanna be us, thugs in the St. Regis
Only thing undefeated is time
The second is the internet, number three is this rhyme
Before security, my dawg had to sneak in the nine
God must be on my side
I had to eat and provide, my winning streak is divine
I told thun, "Leave the street shit behind
Don't let 'em hype you, a slow run beats cheatin' the grind"
Dawg, I'm tellin' it like it is, you gotta deal with the consequence
When you run in a nigga's crib, nigga, you better be ready to sit

Dope dealers, street hustlers, popped cases
Throw dice, on pavement, cop chases
Big gamblers, skullies, hide faces
Gang wars, hot spots, police raid it
Left 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)
Left 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)

Pick a down on his luck rapper, bet he broker
The arrogance of a crackhead mad at a weed smoker
Or a pill taker who hate a distilled wine drinker
A killer who use a gun to hate on a knife swinger
Aight, I get it, it's who the littest, we in competition
Y'all did it first'll be the death, I got a proposition
You and your brothers stop plottin' on each other, plot on millions
Educate yourself, find ten different areas of interest
Spread your bets out
Double down on what's working then you double up
Hands on your paper, they sending hate no matter what you touch
Honestly, I'm speechless
Fly to Greece, twenty pointers on the chain, I freaked it
Lawn chair in the hood, sittin' comfortably
I must be insane givin' you bars runnin' companies
I'm done with the redundancies, checking on my history
Making content for Viacom, license music to Tiffany's
I come from
Dope dealers, street hustlers, popped cases
Throw dice, on pavement, cop chases
Big gamblers, skullies, hide faces
Gang wars, hot spots, police raid it
Left 'em speechless (Speechless)
Just like when the judge read the sentence
Threw your life away in minutes
Left 'em speechless (Speechless)
The bounce back, the greatest feeling
When they thought that you was finished
Leave 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)
Speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)8Embed
