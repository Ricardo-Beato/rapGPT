Ayy, yo
Ayy, ayy
Oh

Finding myself
Showing myself
Finding a way to stay outta the way
Holding me back
Supposed to come right back
Guardin' myself while I'm all on display
I know you know all about it
I know, deep down, you feel the same
I know you know how I feel
I know you know how I feel
How do I, how do I feel? How do I feel?
How do you say to my face, "Time heals"?
Then go and leave me again, unreal
I see us fadin' away
I'm still holdin' my breath for the day that you will
See that the effort I make is too real
How can you say that you know how I feel?
Ayy, whee
How can you say you know what I'm feeling? Wait
Know what I'm feeling, wait
You don't feel nothing, wait
Nothing is healing, wait
Time is just killing, wait
How can you say? Wait
You know what I'm feeling, wait
Know what I'm feeling, wait
You don't feel nothing, wait
Time isn't healing, wait
Time is revealing, wait
How are you feeling? Wait
You don't feel nothing

Me
Me

Just like I expected, falling back on me
Falling with I, falling back on me
Falling back on me, falling back on me
Falling back on mе, falling back on me
Falling back on me, falling back on me
Falling back on mе, falling back on me
Falling back on me, falling back on me
Falling back on me
Falling back on me, falling back on me
Falling back on me, falling back on me
Falling back on me, falling back on me
Falling back on me, falling back on me
What would you do without me?
What would you do without me?
I think you would lose everything
Fallin' back on me
