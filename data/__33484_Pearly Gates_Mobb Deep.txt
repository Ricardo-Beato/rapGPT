32 ContributorsPearly Gates Lyrics
Is it true what the good book say
Concerning the Judgement Day?
If I don't kneel down and pray
Will I be a sinner forâ€”

Yeah, homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good
Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood

Now if you followed my footsteps and walked in my shoes
You wouldn't go against me cause you know you would lose
It's been a long time coming, I done paid my dues
Now every time I turn around, it's like I'm back in the news
I know a lotta niggas want me wearing cement shoes
And Uncle Tom niggas wanna see me locked up too
Around the same time KRS was writing Black Cop
I was busy tryna pump cracks in the back blocks
Popping shit to my homies about how my gat pop
Got rid of that chrome thing and got a black Glock
P-90 held ten but I had six shots
I used to walk around with it and risk gettin' knocked
I bought a fresh box of bullets from Old Man Sam
Wanted to shoot a nigga so bad, it was itching my hand
Some shot it out with me, and some of 'em ran
And some of the gats worked good and some of 'em jammed
You might also like
Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good
Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood
Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood

Now if you take a good look and look into my face
A nigga wouldn't even dare to violate my space
Son, I did so much dirt, I'm tryna clean my slate
And ate so many niggas' food and now they want mines ate
The dogs bark when I walk and sense the souls I took
Moms pray for me with her right hand on the good book
Saw shots fly by me, know I should've been dripping
The pulp fiction musta been God's divine intervention
Wouldn't thought then from that I've learned my lesson
And clean my act up and go straight to confession
Uncle Lyle got knocked, the Feds hit him with seven
And left me with the 50 cal. and a MAC-11
Stuck everything from everything, from heads to the workers
And had half the hood damn near wanting to murk us
Found myself asking God, "What the fuck is my purpose?"
You go to heaven, know I'm foul but put a good word in
Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good
Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood
Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood

Now homie if I go to hell and you make it to the pearly gates
Tell (the boss man) we got beef
And tell (his only son) I'ma see him when I see him
And when I see him, I'ma (beat him like the movie)
For leaving us out to dry in straight poverty
For not showing me no signs they watching over me
Look, we a new breed in 2006
We don't give a fuck about that (religious bullshit)
Nigga show me where the cash at, the nice whips
With the three car garage to fit them shits
Man my life is painful, you pray to angels
I'm praying to myself hoping I ain't gotta spank you
My bullets'll shank you
And when my gun start cutting, ain't nobody gon' save you
In the Bible times, they ain't had to deal with the shit
We been dealing with, these survival times
Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good
Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood
Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood2Embed
