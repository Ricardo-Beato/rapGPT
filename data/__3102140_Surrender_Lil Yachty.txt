20 ContributorsSurrender Lyrics
I will surrender to you, babe
I will surrender to love, ayy, ayy
I will surrender to you, babe
I will surrender to love, ayy
My hair blonde, your shit red like a cherry
We both un-ordinary, this shit real, they synthetic
You get they how you want it, found your lady then gon' run it
'Bout that green, I'mma want it, now you know how I'm on it
You the only that make me surrender, yeah
You the only that make me surrender, yeah
You the only that make me surrender, yeah
You the only that make me surrender, yeah

Girl, you know you really changed my life
Girl, you know you really changed my life
You're my wife
I remember those nights, we stayed up all night
Yeah, we fucked and we fight, but we know we would be alright
Oh, oh, that's why you're my type
Oh, oh, that's why you're my type
Oh, oh, oh, that's why you're my type
Oh, oh, that's why you're my type

That's why you're my type (And that's why you're my type)
That's why you're my type (And that's why you're...)
