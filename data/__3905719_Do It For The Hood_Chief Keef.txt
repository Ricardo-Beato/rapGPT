7 ContributorsDo It For The Hood Lyrics
I do it for the hood
Yeah I do it for the hood
I do it for the hood
Yeah I said I do it for the hood
There's nothing better
Yeah I said There's nothing better
There's nothing better
And who else could do it better?

I live my life normal but my shit ain't regular
I do it for the hood, who else?
There's nothing better
I live my life normal but my shit ain't regular
I do it for the hood, who else?
There's nothing better
I do it for the hood
Yeah I do it for the hood
I do it for the hood
Yeah I do it for the hood

I do it for the hood, yeah them niggas out there stupid
Gettin all that money all my niggas out there movin'
Trappin' or ballin' whatever you should call it
Them niggas who have my back whenever I should call em'
I see 'em in a daze, me and Keef we gettin' paid
Smokin' on that loud, you can smell it a block away
Hit the strip all day, all strapped all day
And you know I gotta get it with the guys so I admit it
To tell you what it is, but this is what it isn't
I do it for the hood and the guys up in the system
Some real niggas gone, but you know I really miss em'
So stayin on my feet, for these niggas I ain't slippin
They trippin'
You might also like

Let's kick it, but I ain't talkin' parties
I'm in the air right now and I ain't talkin' where them stars be
I'm talkin' bout that good shit, that loud shit, no mouth shit
Ballin' like the Mavericks, want cash to come and see me
These haters, I can't see 'em, I can't see 'em like they Stevie
Standin' on my shit, in the hole like Michael Beasley
Trappin' in the hood with them guys what I'm good at
Never sweat with racks, so I never even look back
When the hood is up, the police they tear it down
But I freeze and tell them hoes that they be thirsty when I post up
Bands is gettin' off and these bitches gettin' lost
Cuz bands is gettin' off and these bitches gettin' lost, Ah!
