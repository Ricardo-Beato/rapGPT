I’m on that next shit
I’m on that next shit
You on that old shit

I got a figure eight figure, lick it more bigger
Never booty shots, ass look thicker, ask jack tripper
I dance like stripper, been hot since Billy Dee was drinking malt liquor
I rock a beat like wooh, other chicks kboo like they at the apollo
I get it crazy for you baby, been rapping since y’all was lil' babies
You better respect moi, voulez-vous coucher, yes moi
No I can’t be stopped, might see me down the street in a brand new car
Now if y’all ain’t on this new shit right now
Now ya’ll gon have to find a new beat, new beat?
Now if all y’all on this new shit right here, take your clothes off in the vip

Take clothes off, take clothes off
Oh  I take my clothes off, I take my clothes off, let’s go
To the flo’, take it off, to the flo’, take it off
To the flo’, take it off, to the flo’, take it off

Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name Miss
Rocking like no one else,  I don’t need ya’ll cause I’m feeling myself
Haters y'all just be worried to death
Like a throw back, to the flow back
Return of the Mac, go ‘head take my Kodak
I’m all that, ya ain’t know that
You can’t keep track if you had a low jack
Yeap, must of thought I was over
Been hot before Michael Jackson wore loafers  (say what?)
Ya' was youngin, I was much older
Been rich before you even knew about Oprah
Before you knew about Oprah
Been rich before you knew about Oprah, haha  get it
Been rich before you even knew about Oprah
You might also like
Take clothes off, take clothes off
Oh  I take my clothes off, I take my clothes off, let’s go
To the flo’, take it off, to the flo’, take it off
To the flo’, take it off, to the flo’, take it offEmbed
