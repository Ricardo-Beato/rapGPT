3 ContributorsFamily Vacation Lyrics
Yeah (Yeah)

Ever since sixth grade, all the other kids say
That I'm such a bitch-made, wannabe, renaissance man (Uh)
But my shit bangs, all I do is spit flames on 'em
Like get it, hot damn, yo, that kid is not playin' (Not playin')
I dream about a place where the lights dim down (Dim down)
And when they all treat me like a white Chris Brown (Chris Brown)
They wasn't big on me, but I might fit now (Fit now)
I grew up just a little and they like my style (Yeah they do)
But I think that that's a ways away
It's gonna be a little while 'fore I make it rain
I came to play, but I'm still all business
And I ain't tryna slow down and wait until y'all get it (Y'all get it)
I'm on my grizz like Tony Allen
And I'm the shizz from Sactown to Coney Island
Make 'em open eyelids, 'cause they know I'm wildin'
And even when it gets tense, I ain't showin' violence

Tell me why this life's so swell
And this beat's got the vibe of a nice hotel (Nice hotel)
I'm in a lobby sippin' hot chocolate
People watchin' while I'm sittin' there just not talkin'
It's November in Michigan and this family vacation feels more like imprisonment
But I know it's all gonna be nostalgia soon
And when I look back, I can say I called it, too
You might also like
We're usually at the Marriott, but this is just a little better (Yeah, nice)
Makes me want to find a fireplace and a Christmas sweater (Christmas sweater)
So cozy that I'm yellin', "F a water park!" (F it!)
I'm not the type to play, unless I got the part
LOL, that's a joke I came up with
Shouts out to the bros I came up with (My bros!)
Imaginary friends like bros I came up with
If you ever meet me, man, you know I can't function (Can't function)
And I ain't blowin' that substance (No!)
Sweet not sour, though you know it stays puffin'
Memories with all the homies that I've ate lunch with
Chicken nuggets on my tray, I know I've ate hundreds (Hundreds)
I wanna live the eight hundred
Infatuated with the woman I can make love with
If you ain't with it, please don't say nothin' (Yes)
You can dislike it, but you know you can't touch this

Tell me why this life's so swell
And this beat's got the vibe of a nice hotel
I'm in a lobby sippin' hot chocolate
People watchin' while I'm sittin' there just not talkin'
It's November in Michigan and this family vacation feels more like imprisonment
But I know it's all gonna be nostalgia soon
And when I look back, I can say I called it, too
Really wishin' that this town was larger (Yeah)
I'm feelin' 'bout as independent as the Founding Fathers (Ben Franklin)
But my father tryna find his son
'Cause my phones dead and I still haven't found my charger (Sorry, man)
Couple dollars, and plenty of change
I'ma walk down the hall to the vending machine
And eat enough fat food to put me into my grave (Damn)
My cash runnin' low, like the end of my name (My name)
But I ain't even stoppin' there
In the mood for some Rally's, so I ask the concierge ("Hey, yo, uh...")
If he knows where one's at or if they've even got it here
He said, "There's a couple in town, but really, not one near
But there's a Long John Silver's down the block
About five minutes away, if you wanna make the walk"
Oh really? Thanks a lot, asshole (I'm not eatin' Long John Silver's)

Tell me why this life's so swell
And this beat's got the vibe of a nice hotel
I'm in a lobby sippin' hot chocolate
People watchin' while I'm sittin' there just not talkin'
It's November in Michigan and this family vacation feels more like imprisonment
But I know it's all gonna be nostalgia soon
And when I look back, I can say I called it, too
Tell me why this life's so swell
And this beat's got the vibe of a nice hotel
I'm in a lobby sippin' hot chocolate
People watchin' while I'm sittin' there just not talkin'
It's November in Michigan and this family vacation feels more like imprisonment
But I know it's all gonna be nostalgia soon
And when I look back, I can say I called it, tooEmbed
