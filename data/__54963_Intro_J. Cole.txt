Still at it
Villematic
What a life we chose
I'm sending this out to those
Who fell down, but then rose
I'm hot, I'm hellbound
With these flows, Cole
And when my story's told
Let it be know I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine
But me I glow
So, I'm coming for what I'm owed
