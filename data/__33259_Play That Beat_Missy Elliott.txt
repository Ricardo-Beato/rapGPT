I'ma beat y'all, play that beat
I'ma beat y'all, play that beat (This is a Missy Elliott exclusive)
I'ma beat y'all, play that beat
I'ma beat y'all, play that beat

When you wanna go around the world (I'm ready, uh)
And if you want me to fight your ex-girl for you (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you need me to cook you meals (I'm ready, yeah)
And if you want me to come and chill with you, boy (Sugar, I'm ready, uh, come on, uh)

You don't know how you got me (No)
I never been this open, not me (No, no, no)
I'm the one who's known not to be (Come on, no)
Givin' up the— easy (So easy)
Something you do reminds me (Uh-huh, something you do, babe)
Friends been tryin' to stop me (Come on, no, no, no)
They can't believe you got me (Uh-huh)
Givin' up the— easy

When you need a back rub from working all day (I'm ready, uh)
When you need a chick to come over right away (I'm ready, uh-uh, like this)
When you need me to wash your clothes, boy (I'm ready, yeah)
When you need me on the phone to curse out the hoes (Sugar, I'm ready, I'm ready)
