I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you
Oh, baby, I should buy you another round
'Cause you care, and I swear that I'm here, but I'm there
It's gettin' harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place with a lake, such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it, I break it
That might just break me down

And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember, I've been keepin' it together, but I'm feelin' strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...

You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs

Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down

Yeah, well, I'm just being honest, my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time, the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turnin' 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie, though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make-believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walkin', droppin' change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity, um, I move carelessly, that's why I'm always trippin'
I guess it's like electrolytes, you help me go the distance
Not too efficient, but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...

You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down61Embed
