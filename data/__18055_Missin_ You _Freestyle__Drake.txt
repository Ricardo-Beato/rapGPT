13 ContributorsMissinâ€™ You (Freestyle) Lyrics
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars, I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would've cared more
That's my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
'Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a missus
You might also like
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out? Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you outta my mind

And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
Missin' everything you say
Missin' all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby '07 supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
'Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
I can't stop, missing you
I can't stop, missing you
(I don't wanna stop) I can't stop missing you
(Baby) I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop, missin' you2Embed
