14 ContributorsMomma Lyrics
Damn, this is for all my women
That been going through the struggle
On welfare, living the rough life
It's gonna be alright
Yes it yes uh
This is how we gonna do it
I want you to explain your story
Then I'ma tell you mines
Tell 'em
Hustling, striving, struggling surviving (momma, momma)
Never realizing, that you were a diamond (momma, momma)
Through the sun or the rain, through the pain I'ma hold you down (hold you down)
Through the good or the bad times (I got love for you)
Through the stress and the heart aches (so much love for you)

It's not ya momma's fault, it's ya father's fault
It's your father's fault your mother is an alcoholic
Confusing the brain from the booze and the pain
And plus he cheated on her, beated on her, smack-dab in the rain
She Lost her first child in 74
And that lead to nervous breakdowns
Bacardi dark she downing it raw
She can't take it she constantly crying falling down on her knees
Like "help me Lord please I'm ready to leave"
All she needed was somebody to rub her feet
Give her a nice hug and rescue her from off these streets, come on

Hustling, striving, struggling surviving (momma, momma)
Never realizing, that you were a diamond (momma, momma)
Through the sun or the rain, through the pain I'ma hold you down (hold you down)
Through the good or the bad times (I got love for you)
Through the stress and the heart aches (so much love for you)

I been sent by an angel to snatch you up
Take you way above the clouds and back you up
At night you can lay in my arms feel the heart beating
Don status in the sheets I'm keeping you warm
Ain't no nigga gon' do what I do
I'ma take care of you and ya kids
Take the bent and go handle ya biz
The bills is paid, the cable's back on
I quote you know the seeds want they Nickelodeon on
I'm not ashamed to support you
Floss you or gloss you out
Fat, skinny out of shape I'll dior you out

Hustling, striving, struggling surviving (momma, momma)
Never realizing, that you were a diamond (momma, momma)
Through the sun or the rain, through the pain I'ma hold you down (hold you down)
Through the good or the bad times (I got love for you)
Through the stress and the heart aches (so much love for you)
In the hood there's a struggle, my girl is in trouble
She's lacking guidance in the mind she's blinded and puzzled
Her pops never showed her the ropes
Her moms raised mad kids on her own
She never had a strong man in her home

Nothing in this life, sun don't always shine
But it can't rain all the time (everything's gonna be alright)
Somebody sees your pain, you will never hurt again
I see you momma, I see you momma
You can cry yours eyes (cry your eyes)
It will be alright (it will be alright)

Hustling, striving, struggling surviving (momma, momma)
Never realizing, that you were a diamond (momma, momma)
Through the sun or the rain, through the pain I'ma hold you down (hold you down)
Through the good or the bad times (I got love for you)
Through the stress and the heart aches (so much love for you)1Embed
