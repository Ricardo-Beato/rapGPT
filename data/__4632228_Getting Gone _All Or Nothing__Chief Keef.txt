5 ContributorsGetting Gone (All Or Nothing) Lyrics
Yeah, you know, go
This for all my balling ass niggas man
They be in the hood, throwing up they sets man
All or nothing
L's bitch, eskettit
All my niggas getting it, 064 shawty
Lamron, my Wic City niggas throw it up

I'm 'bout that money all or nothing on you hoes
Wic City shawty always busting on you hoes
I gotta go, gotta get it before
Another nigga come around then I gotta switch the flow
Okay I'm gone, Mr. In another zone
And I'm down for whatever when my niggas get it on
064 shawty and my niggas in the wrong
And we rolling up the loud while my niggas getting dome

Guns up, with our sets in ya states
Up in my Camaro got some  on ya face
Wic City, the clique is getting long
Macho Man flexing got the clique getting strong
Fuck that, my niggas upping Rugers
You get yo ass burnt that's what them hollow tips will do ya
Off lean, outside trapping
Nigga got his ass capping he was outside capping
She saying woah 'cause I took her to my hood
Old people, 'lotta bitches and some niggas in my hood
Real gang bangers, my niggas get it in
I got a sneaky bitch and he think she can get it in
Chilling with the lam, we got them bitches screaming goddamn
'Cause I'm the man, this is who I am
And I'm all about them dollars tryna make a million
You might also like
I'm 'bout that money all or nothing on you hoes
Wic City shawty always busting on you hoes
I gotta go, gotta get it before
Another nigga come around then I gotta switch the flow
Okay I'm gone, Mr. In another zone
And I'm down for whatever when my niggas get it on
064 shawty and my niggas in the wrong
And we rolling up the loud while my niggas getting dome

Come in them gates, you get yo ass stomped
If he outside them gates then you get yo ass jumped
Hands in the air, this a fucking stick up
We some niggas from the hood tryna get our rich up
(?) popping bottles, Stevie rolling blunts
Big A I got you good then I ever ever stunt
There's a party in the Wic, the GD's can't come
In the party dropping rakes, the GD's ain't none
She see it before it happen, my bitch think she splashy
Don't get attitude, she ain't gone never like it
But ion give a fuck, gotta get to the dough
If I'm outside cracking then I'm getting to the dough
See that money look good, I fuck around and take it
And if its to be made then I'll fuck around and make it
Oh shit, what the fuck is this
And I can't get killed for no motherfucking bitch so
I'm 'bout that money all or nothing on you hoes
Wic City shawty always busting on you hoes
I gotta go, gotta get it before
Another nigga come around then I gotta switch the flow
Okay I'm gone, Mr. In another zone
And I'm down for whatever when my niggas get it on
064 shawty and my niggas in the wrong
And we rolling up the loud while my niggas getting dome

(?)
All or nothing
Still with the shit man Aon in this bitch
Shoutouts to all my niggas on that grind man
Hitting stangs, doing whatever we gotta do to get that money man
I salute youEmbed
