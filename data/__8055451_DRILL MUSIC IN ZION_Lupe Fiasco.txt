48 ContributorsDRILL MUSIC IN ZION Lyrics
Yeah

The August symphonic, power of a Blahnik
To heal steel, medical bill drill harmonics
Silver sonnets from the "bonne nuits" and bonnets
I leave a whole sleeve down in Condoleezza's comments
Copper ebonics, competent and gannet
Godzilla's economics rock gondolas 'til you vomit
Bigger than the tongue and write signatures with a Thomas
Great Wall of China climber and Bonnie Woo correspondent
Opera onyx, popular's for convicts
Stay below the doppler, turn Robotniks into Sonics
Positioned jostlers, monitor hegemonics
Robots make the robots that solder thе electronics
Nostradamus couldn't bother to keep a promisе
Logic's on the rocket, what profit defeats a conscience?
Somebody's daughter is contemplating the convent
But a man with a dollar is slobbering for her haunches
Mouth is just watering for some nonsense
And this might be the moment her modeling probably launches
Gobbling collard greens through the rumpus
Washing gasoline, watch hollering, replace a congress
Golden gossiping auditing through my content
Running out of water, just pondering where the pond went
World's hottest summer, we're wondering if they pawned it
Desperate for the credits to come tumbling through the conflict, yeah
You might also like
These episodes of the soul
Make me cold, pass the 'mote control
Can you make a hole for
All the drill music in Zion?
These episodes of the soul
Make me cold, pass the 'mote control
Can we make a hole for
All the drill music in Zion?

Now there are those that resoluted to wreck
Got caught, fought, lost, electrocuted to death
Came a little late for the rescue and the flesh
DNA exonerates posthumously whatever's left
No resurrection but reputation's correct
The revelation brings decorated regrets
All due respect, it's not really about fair
Collective sigh 'cause the real killer's still out there
Probably calling up police
Complaining 'bout his neighbours or just walking on the beach
Why should he have such views of the ocean?
And not be hanging from the gallows with his neck neatly broken?
I let it soak in, then I put the soap in
Then I put the boats in, then I play with both them
The hot tub's now lookin' like a yacht club
Makin' sure I get all of the shoes like a bot does
Neighbor is pissed
Tells the cops "if he wants to bathe like a sailor
Live on a container ship"
I party all night and the bangin' is intense
'Cause I know exactly what you did
And you gon' pay for it, you bitch
These episodes of the soul
Make me cold, pass the 'mote control
Can you make a hole for
All the drill music in Zion?
These episodes of the soul
Make me cold, pass the 'mote control
Can we make a hole for
All the drill music in Zion?

We'll end this shortly, story moral is the same
You either fly into the portal or pull the portal over the plane
Coralling mortals is nothing short of insane
Let's try and turn this quart of water to a quart of Bartles & Jaymes, haha

These episodes of the soul
Make me cold, pass the 'mote control
Can we make a hole for
All the drill music in Zion?
These episodes of the soul
Make me cold, pass the 'mote control
Can we make a hole for
All the drill music in Zion?9Embed
