21 ContributorsWhoa Lyrics
When I saw you last night I tripped out
'Cause last time I saw you, you was mad right
Now you smiling, yeah that's right
You were in love, and I was on drugs
I wasn't rich yet, I was a thug
Girl, you make me go whoa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoa

When I see you, I smile, my brothers like, "What's that?"
And I'm like, "When she leaves my mind she comes right back"
And they're like, "ooh baby, you're tripping in that stack"
'Cause I'm smiling and they know that we didn't have had sex
I'll ride with you in my passenger seat
I'll stop seeing women that I see every week
I'll put my guard down and we'll go out to eat
If this was all a dream, I'll see you in my sleep

When I saw you last night I tripped out
'Cause last time I saw you, you was mad right
Now you smiling, yeah that's right
You were in love, and I was on drugs
I wasn't rich yet, I was a thug
Girl, you make me go whoaaaaaaaa
You make me go whoaaaaaaaa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoaaaaaaaa

Let's grow old together
Baby, I'm gon' treat you better
I can be the sun in your rainy weather
Let's just get together
What do you eat? What's your favorite color?
Do you like D. Rose or do you like Butler?
So you don't smoke? Okay, that's fine
I'ma need 20 minutes of your time, cause you're a dime

When I saw you last night I tripped out
'Cause last time I saw you, you was mad right
Now you smiling, yeah that's right
You were in love, and I was on drugs
I wasn't rich yet, I was a thug
Girl, you make me go whoaaaaaaaa
You make me go whoaaaaaaaa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoa
You make me go whoaaaaaaaa4Embed
