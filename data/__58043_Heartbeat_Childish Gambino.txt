167 ContributorsHeartbeat Lyrics
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walkin' round naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over
When it's all over, no settlin' down
My text go to your screen, you know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sittin' at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinkin' that this song's comin' on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start callin'; you start crying
I come over; I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til it come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losin'
I'm a ghost, and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place, 'cause
You might also like
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

It's late-night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Hmm, well, two can play that game
So I'm chillin' with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing, and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want somethin' from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one-hunnid
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' 'em if she'd wanna play games
We the Super Smash Brothers, but none of 'em you
I miss the sex where you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the art of choking's
Only thing girls want when you in that smoke and light
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall, and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm goin' straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J. and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money; then you burn me (Bernie), then you made off (Madoff)
She ain't a killer, but she'd fuckin' blow your head off
I know he wonderin', "What the fuck you hidin'?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden; ayo, fuck this
Are we datin'? Are we fuckin'?
Are we best friends? Are we somethin'
In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that
But not really
You say the nastiest shit in bed, and it’s fuckin’ awesome312Embed
