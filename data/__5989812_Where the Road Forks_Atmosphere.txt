5 ContributorsWhere the Road Forks Lyrics
Considering all of the shit that you see
I don't see what you're seeing in me
Considering all of the shit that you see
I don't see what you're seeing in me

I kind of wish I was inside of somebody else dream
I'm trying to fish for some faith that this ain't what it seem
I mean I might have seen them clouds, even felt some rain
My eyes are open like a window that's surrounded by pain
I know sometimes I don't articulate myself right, right?
Maybe it coincides with how we hear ourselves right, right?
I won't tell you that you're supposed to help fight right
But I've got that shelf life if you wanna know what that hell like
The knife is open, you're holding it up to your throat
The taillight's broken, they don't know 'cause you're pulling a boat
Only take what you need, everything else gets left
But if we gotta die tonight, I might take a couple extra breaths
I never been a born loser, but time got no remorse
Watch over those storm troopers, they'll force you to use force
But you're still trying to hold the tears, poker face, show no fear
Lost in space, solar flare, don't really care if the coast is clear
I'm making motions, I hope it's enough to get home
This lake is frozen, cold as fuck if you sit on a throne
Only give what you can and try not to overextend
But if we gotta die tonight, I don't wanna make any more friends
This train is ours, we should be tagging and writing
This paint was power, now we got jobs in advertising
But you still trying to hold the torch, of course we took no shorts
With a hand-drawn map and some rose quartz
You can meet me at where the road forks
You might also like
Considering all of the shit that you see
I don't see what you're seeing in me
Considering all of the shit that you see
I don't see what you're seeing in me
Considering all of the shit that you see (Maybe I don't really wanna know what up)
I don't see what you're seeing in me (If ain't nowhere for us to go from here but up)
Considering all of the shit that you see
I don't see what4Embed
