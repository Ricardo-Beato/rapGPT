G'wop
No
Catch up
Bang 2
Catch up
Bang 2
Skrrt, skrrt

I be off the shits, can't shit upset me
I come through in my 'Rari, kickin' shit like Jet Li
Hop in my Bentley, please do not tempt me
Or come through in my Audi, choppin' shit like Jet Li
She see my neckpiece, now she wanna molest me
And I'ma let her do it, break a bitch like Jet Li
Jet Li, yeah bitch, Jet Li
If that bitch don't respect me, I kick that bitch like Jet Li (Bang)

My life a movie, Kung Fu movie
Bitch don't wanna do me, I kick that bitch like Bruce Lee
I'm with Chelsea, smoking on this QP
And If she don't do me, I kick that bitch like Bruce Lee
She gon' regret me, regret that she ain't let me
Kick that bitch to the curb, to the curb like Jet Li
She see my earpiece, my wristpiece, my neckpiece
Johnny Dang ice on, he choppin' shit like Jet Li
You might also like
I be off the shits, can't shit upset me
I come through in my 'Rari, kicking shit like Jet Li
Hop in my Bentley, please do not tempt me
Or come through in my Audi, choppin' shit like Jet Li
She see my neckpiece, now she wanna molest me
And I'ma let her do it, break a bitch like Jet Li
Jet Li, yeah bitch, Jet Li
If that bitch don't respect me, I kick that bitch like Jet Li

I'm in the club, QP of that Cali cookie
I'm known for doing stunts, bitches think I'm Bruce Willis
Black Bentley, bought it 'cause it match my Ken Griffeys
And even though I'm worth a milli', Gucci still pitchin'
East Atlanta finest, you can say the 6 in it
Bitches stand and applaud, how I talk, nigga
So many cars, can't fit all in my garage, nigga
This drop-top 'Rari make me think that I'm Chuck Norris, nigga

I be off the shits, can't shit upset me
I come through in my 'Rari, kicking shit like Jet Li
Hop in my Bentley, please do not tempt me
Or come through in my Audi, choppin' shit like Jet Li
She see my neckpiece, now she wanna molest me
And I'ma let her do it, break a bitch like Jet Li
Jet Li, yeah bitch, Jet Li
If that bitch don't respect me, I kick that bitch like Jet Li3Embed
