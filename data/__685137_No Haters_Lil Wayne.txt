50 ContributorsNo Haters Lyrics
London on da Track, bitch!

We catch a body and we laugh about it
I fucked her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Grinding, it's agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet
Ooh, I lost my mind, I'm like "Fuck everybody!"
Yeah, I lost my mind, but I got extra copies
Yeah, I fuck so long, it feel like exercising
I'll test a lion before testifying
All I got is hitters in my squad
I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
I want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Zero fucks given
I make her come to the condo butt naked 'cause, bitch, ain't no stealin'
She still come visit, she don't wan' leave
She compared it to me leaving a witness
I said, "I get it," I keep some cocaine on me for the bitches
And this AK is not for decoration
Fuckboys give me the heebie-jeebies
I got a hit list like the Yellow Pages
Hey, if she can suck a dick and snort a Quaalude
Then, ooh, baby, you got my full attention
Champagne expensive, it taste good or vintage
Open your nose, I'll put some sugar in it
I don't fuck around with them fuck-arounds
Uh, I might fuck around and catch a body
Yeah, I got some niggas that'll hunt you down
Yeah, and catch you slipping like you playing hockey
Woo! We catch a body and we laugh about it
Yeah, I fuck her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Uh, money and drugs, I'm talkin' math and science
Ooh, skinny tires, on a salad diet
Chopper leave you with a half a body
Make sure he dead, before we leave, my nigga, grab his wallet
Ooh, I got the hook up on them rocket launchers
I told Obama, "Fuck with me, you know I got it"
Slime, you need to fuck with me, you know I got it
I know somebody that know somebody
Look, traffic dying, we still trap-or-dying
It's agonizing but it's gratifying
Squad! I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
Want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Hold up, you ain't got no hitters in your squad
I could get you killed, that's my real day job
I'm a crime of passion, I'm a fucking hate crime
Spit like I ate bombs, Eminem on 8 Mile
I'm the motherfucking man, Scarface, Facemob
Pockets looking like The Blob, chips like Cape Cod
Bust your motherfucking egg 'til I see egg nog
My bougie bitch ratchet, my ratchet bitch a straight snob
Hold up, who know how to read gang signs?
Cause we gon' throw 'em up and we gon' give 'em hang time
I got white, I got brown, sell it at the same time
That's that James Brown, and that's that James Bond, ooh
We catch a body and we laugh about it
It's catastrophic but we glamorize it
It's agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet, ooh!
Chopper leave you with a half a body
No hesitation, no stall, like the bathroom crowded
Chopper so big, so tall, it could wrap around me
