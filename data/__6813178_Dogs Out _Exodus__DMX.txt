Yo Swizz, this what we doing?
Weezy, what up? (Ooh-wee, rrrrr)
Why must you insist on being so motherfuckin' much (Woo!)
Of a motherfuckin' (Woo!) pussy to a dog, bitch?
Hm-hm (Nah dog)
Come on!

Who let the dogs out? Who let the dogs out?
I stretch your jaw out, who next to call out?
Who left the call out? (Uh) You catch the fall out (Yeah)
You take the ball out, I get to ball out (Come on!)
None of my dawgs could say I left my dawgs out (Uh huh)
I never dog out my fellow bloodhound (Wow)
I left it all out, y'all letting it all out (Yeah)
Go extra hard out, y'all ask your dog 'bout me (Woo)
Lil Tunechi baddest dog up in the dog house (Uh)
Keep a bad bitch walk around with my bone out (Uh)
She swallow puppies, you know we got PETA on the phone now (Okay)
I make her pussy rain cats and dogs, ooh, it's pourin' down (Damn)
Gave my dog a pound 'causе he hit me with a couple pounds (Rrr)
Tеll your big dog I'll break him down to puppy chow (Oh!)
