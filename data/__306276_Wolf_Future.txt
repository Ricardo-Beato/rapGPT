23 ContributorsWolf Lyrics
I was raised up where them wolves at, slung dope where them killas hung
My auntie's house was a dope house and I slung dope in my longjohns
My grandma seen me bust a plate, put 30 stacks on 4 squares
C Dub doin' 15, got out, doin' another 25
Got the lean molly look in my eyes, got blood and sweat in my eyes
5D, my phone i, makin' lots of money on my own time
Hard times inspired me, concrete, that lion turf
45, my iron work, I'm a real nigga, that's after birth
Astronaut, and that's after Earth, Scientology, Tom and Kate
And I know I can whip a cake, and I seen niggas infiltrate
This fly shit they try to confiscate, as I sit back and I meditate
I'm top dog and I'm emperor, all dogs gon' go to heaven
Ridin' round with my mac-11, all these bitches swallowin'
Take a crew to the other side, bad bitch, she bisexual
A bad bitch with a bad bitch, gone off these Franklins
Gone off these Franklins, yeah gone off these Franklins

I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
I'm gone off these Franklins, gone off these Franklins
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
She gone off these Franklins, gone off these Franklins

Aye where the hook at, my nigga?
I used to cook up them cookies and I ain't look back my nigga
It's a crook in me, nigga
Lord I'm prayin' for my demons, MDA in my semen
I was talkin' to God the other day, swear I was leanin'
God forgive me, forgive me, Oh no I didn't do it
But just go right in the booth, and spit my heart and my anger
My closest friends givin' up, man they feelin' like strangers
I got my whole crib plush, with guns like a ranger
You gotta take me on a high speed chase before you catch me
You either live, you either die, that's the only way you'll get me
Aww man, aww man, I should have stayed at Columbia High
It was times that I thought "What I'm thinkin', like why
I am who I am?" and shit I can't cry
I was built for this lifestyle, damn, honestly
From the gutter travelin' to another country
All kings need to be crowned, that's my pedigree

I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
I'm gone off these Franklins, gone off these Franklins
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
She gone off these Franklins, gone off these Franklins9Embed
