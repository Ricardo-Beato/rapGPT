40 ContributorsInternal Bleeding Lyrics

Hmm, oh
Woah

I done tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can't stop this internal bleeding (Hmm)
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
Tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can't stop this internal bleeding (Hmm)
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
Tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can't stop this internal bleeding (Huh)
My heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
Tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can't stop this internal bleeding
My heart is leaking
And it hurts

Oh, uh
Cut me down, slice me deep, I dare you
Burn my crown, spit on my grave, I’ll make you
See my face, see my face, I’ll haunt you
Deep in the dark, behind your eyes, I’m on you
Salt of the Earth, bird of the Heavens, you hear them
All in the hell, the hollowest halls, don’t fear them
Here I am, the warrior man
Here I stand, the warrior man
You might also like
But I done tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can’t stop this internal bleeding (Hmm)
My heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
Tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can’t stop this internal bleeding (Hmm)
My heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
And it hurts me
