74 ContributorsIt’s Been Real (Outro) Lyrics
Thanks, it's been real, I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me
But before I go, you know I can't close the show
Without no closure, so before I leave
Yeah, I just want to take the time out to basically say
Rest In Peace to Deshaun Holton, that's my heart man
Dr. Dre, for giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me; to get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine, Interscope, Aftermath
Everybody in the whole Shady staff
Everybody who’s basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenberg, Tracy McNew
You know I love you guy, I couldn't do it all without you
D12, Ca$his
You're gonna be a beast when you get out there man
Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me
Who else am I forgetting? Oh yeah, Obie Trice
Bobby Creekwater, and basically, man, the whole city of Detroit
8 Mile Road for makin' what I am today
Which basically goes back to Proof and D12
I love you guys, man
Runyon Ave for holdin' me down when shit got thick
Oh, it wouldn't be complete, If I didn't thank my mom, bitch
Haha, so—
