12 ContributorsMaking of a Murderer Lyrics
This beat from Murda (Murda)

Started off a local dude, like, nah, I never heard of you (It's Gucci)
They wouldn't give me a shot, but now my money got a vertical (It's jumpin')
Started on the MARTA bus, but now I drive convertibles (Vert)
It's Gucci Mane and Murda Beatz, and niggas wanna murder you (Well damn)
The dope so clean, I cut it, they didn't know this shit was surgical (Woo)
Can't let the haters in no more, that's what I closed the curtain for
Started as a burglar, but turned into a murderer (Woo)
The story of me growin' up, the making of a murderer (It's Gucci)

Come ride with the BC, me, pre to Gucci
Yup, in my black tee (Yup), hand on my Uzi (Yup)
Trigger finger squeeze in the sun (Yup), like a Capri (Yup)
Try me, young boy (Yup), strapped to an IV (Bah)
'80 baby, crack spread just like poison ivy (Skrrt)
Without it, where would I be? Sun Valley with the ivory (Damn)
Ask how I survived it, real crazy and conniving (Crazy)
Guwop really grimy, I send a slug, he slimy
Wasn't born with diamonds, me and money wasn't Siamese
Killed that boy with kindness, delivery killers, Chinese
Let's have a moment for silence for anyone else try me

Started off a local dude, like, nah, I never heard of you (It's Gucci)
They wouldn't give me a shot, but now my money got a vertical (It's jumpin')
Started on the MARTA bus, but now I drive convertibles (Vert)
It's Gucci Mane and Murda Beatz, and niggas wanna murder you (Well damn)
The dope so clean, I cut it, they didn't know this shit was surgical (Woo)
Can't let the haters in no more, that's what I closed the curtain for
Started as a burglar, but turned into a murderer (Woo)
The story of me growin' up, the making of a murderer (It's Gucci)

Sun Valley rushes, everybody buckin' (Yeah)
Touch one man (One), now everybody touchin' (Touch)
Lump him like a pumpkin, everybody stompin' (Stomp)
One man jump in, now everybody jumpin' (Jump)
My hood is full of junkies, at night the walkin' zombies (Huh)
The neighbors sayin' nothin', it's vigilante justice (Shh)
They still can't find no suspect, detective screamin', "Fuck it" (Woo)
I re-up with your budget, I grab a brick and bust it (Woo)

Started off a local dude, like, nah, I never heard of you (It's Gucci)
They wouldn't give me a shot, but now my money got a vertical (It's jumpin')
Started on the MARTA bus, but now I drive convertibles (Vert)
It's Gucci Mane and Murda Beatz, and niggas wanna murder you (Well damn)
The dope so clean, I cut it, they didn't know this shit was surgical (Woo)
Can't let the haters in no more, that's what I closed the curtain for
Started as a burglar, but turned into a murderer (Woo)
The story of me growin' up, the making of a murderer (It's Gucci)1Embed
