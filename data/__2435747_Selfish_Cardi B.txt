15 ContributorsSelfish Lyrics
I gave you more than I give myself
So loyal to you that I betrayed myself
Well, I guess I'ma wither away
You a snake, and you chose to slither today
I gave my all; my love and my trust, but
I guess my all just wasn't enough, yeah
There's something about you; I can't help it
But I'ma do for myself, I'm being selfish

Babe, your melody is the voice I need
Makes me skip a beat, yeah
And baby, you know it, yeah
But it's hard to show it, yeah, yeah
See, the one I love used to be in clubs
Used to fuck with thugs, yeah
And I can't expose it, yeah
'Cause she already know it yeah, but

Why don't you ask me
Why is it so hard to fall in love
Why don't you ask me
Why can I never ever ever trust?
Why don't you ask me
Why everything is going in circles
Why don't you ask me (I guess you never know)
You might also like
I guess we never know
They say the one that you truly love
Hurts you the most
Now the one that I truly love
Hurt me the most
Now the one that you truly love
Is hurting you the most
I guess I'll never know
Why I got so cold, it's not your fault, girl

Be selfish, be selfish
Be selfish (I’m so cold, girl)
Be selfish, be selfish
Be selfish (It’s not your fault, girl)
Be selfish, be selfish
Be selfish (I’m so cold, girl)
Be selfish, be selfish
Be selfish (It’s not your fault, girl)

Withering away as I gaze at the sky. Looking at his face, and all the pain it caused me. I ask why. Didn't I love? Didn't I give you more than I ever gave myself? What do you wish, 'cause that part of me no longer exist? This time I'm first, I'm picking me, I finally learned to be selfish.Embed
