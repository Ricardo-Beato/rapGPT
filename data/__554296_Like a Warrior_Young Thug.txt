10 ContributorsLike a Warrior Lyrics
I live my life just like a warrior
And I'm a motherfucking warrior
I live my life just like a warrior
And I'm a motherfucking warrior
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent

And I'm a motherfucking warrior according to the score
The  in there, your ho in there, your bro in there
Africa, got a spot with so much weed, you gotta mow in there
We took 'em out, he had more in there
Kicked him up his ass with Jimmy Cha and Jimmy Cho in there
Bitches see me in that Honda Civic, want my digits
Want my ticket, they can't get it
They ain't get nothing but these kitties
It's impatient in the city got me frigid, but I'm getting it
It ain't on me, boy, it's in me
Spot just beatin just like Nitti
Get the bags out the trash can
See too much weed, I'm gon' spaz
Shotgun nino mash, YSL swag
Rock clad, I’m gon take his ass
One cap out no pass
We too bad, RIP to Spaz, free my nigga Nash, hey
You might also like
I live my life just like a warrior
And I'm a motherfucking warrior
I live my life just like a warrior
And I'm a motherfucking warrior
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent

I live my life just like a warrior, I know that nigga up to something
He standing in the cold with no coat, catch a dime bag with an O and wipe your nose
Stay cold cause that pole on his throat
Hit the jeweler, leave out froze, my diamond blacker than coal
Her pussy dripping, all my pimping
I'm a hippy, know she with it
Get on the plane fuck up your city
My diamond's bleeding, Wicced's pissing
We going in just like Christmas
She on the stage showing her kitty
Thug tattooed on her titty, I look like a ton of midgets
Speaking of midgets, got a night ticket, you want it, I'll go get it
Make one phone call to the bitches, they gon' pull up right here with it
We not worried 'bout no jacking, that's a ticket, no lieutenant
You know DK gonna squeeze until it's empty
I live my life just like a warrior
And I'm a motherfucking warrior
I live my life just like a warrior
And I'm a motherfucking warrior
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent

I live my life just like a warrior, my skin red like Seminoles
Speaking of red, my pen is sponsored by red bottoms
These bitches want everybody, my whole crew they got problems
They old man sitting back watching, they gon' kill that, we can’t stop them
We just looking like a profit in the club, they know we got it
Hit the club looking like Pac, we got muscles just like Rocky
Got all of these bitches bossin' for my bosses, plus your posse look like pasta
We gon' beat em, we gon' eat em, we gon' feed 'em to these divas
Yeah these divas run with heaters, señorita, hasta la vista
They two piece ya, then they leave, for your maker
No Anita, but I'm baking, lots of pizzas what I'm making
Them tortillas, I got acres sitting on acres, motherfucker

I live my life just like a warrior
And I'm a motherfucking warrior
I live my life just like a warrior
And I'm a motherfucking warrior
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent
I creep silent, I creep silent, I creep silent2Embed
