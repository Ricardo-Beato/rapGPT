6 ContributorsActions Is Everything Lyrics
(The Empire)
â€”Bark on these niggas, now they know
Niggas won't respect you 'til you empty out your clip
'Cause actions is everything and words mean shit
Look

I ain't got the patience to talk to these niggas 'cause they slow
Fuck around and bark on these niggas, now they know
Niggas won't respect you 'til you empty out your clip
'Cause actions is everything and words mean shit
I ain't got the patience to talk to these niggas 'cause they slow
Fuck around and bark on these niggas, now they know
Niggas won't respect you 'til you empty out your clip
'Cause actions is everything and words mean shit

That's why, that's why, that's why I'm still up in the hood
Burner on my lap, just to get it understood
Multi-million dollar deals, just sittin' on the table
On the dope block posted, .40 Glock by my navel, blah
Get the picture, nigga, I can take your life away
Plus a pimp nigga, I can take your wife away (Yeah)
Babies havin' babies, kids killin', yeah, that's life today
Better get a pistol, fuck praying for a brighter day
Crease up on my jeans, gold chain up on my white tee (Uh-huh)
I shine, that's why them dirty motherfuckers, they don't like me
I promise I, try to do the right thing like Spike Lee (Yeah)
Despite these efforts, niggas still got extras
So I'ma get it crackin', bust off and let y'all have it (Yeah)
I'm comin' from a hood where killin' niggas is a habit (Yeha)
Everybody did it, everybody done it (Uh)
Everybody with it (Uh), so tell me how you want it, blah

I ain't got the patience to talk to these niggas 'cause they slow
Fuck around and bark on these niggas, now they know
Niggas won't respect you 'til you empty out your clip
'Cause actions is everything and words mean shit
I ain't got the patience to talk to these niggas 'cause they slow
Fuck around and bark on these niggas, now they know
Niggas won't respect you 'til you empty out your clip
'Cause actions is everything and words mean shiEmbed
