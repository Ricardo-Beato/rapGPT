21 ContributorsDrowning Lyrics
A Dedication
Rest in peace Fredo Santana
Say that she used to be a lifeguard
Say that she  drown

Huh, huh, so much fake love, I've been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone, and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down, and I bet you gon' see diamonds
Huh, huh, so much fake love, I've been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone, and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down, and I bet you gon' see diamonds

Don't ask me for shit but this blunt or this dick
Fake love in the air, love bugs turn to ticks
That's more than enough, Pink Floyd in the cup
Brrrrrp, I always pick up, 'less she callin' my bluffs
Smell it, like it, buy it, light it, hit it
Mix it with some molly now we gettin' scientific
Bought another house just to put more pots to piss in
Bitches got they hands out
I shake it like we just did business, this just business, wait
Oh my God, I'm drowning in her kidneys, she like
(Oooooohhh) I just listen
And the higher notes she hit it, I know I sound like a grizzly
And the cocaine look like crystals, that's that white girl, call her Chrissy
Hol' up, listen, see, you fuck it all up, you put that wall up
You feelin' yourself, but I can't hate, 'cause you got that soft touch
Okay, you standin' in rain and driftin' it
You lookin' for change but penny pinch
You swallow your pride, I'm sippin' it
You drown in your tears, I swim in 'em, 6 shit
You might also like
Huh, huh, so much fake love, I've been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone, and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down, and I bet you gon' see diamonds
Huh, huh, so much fake love, I've been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone, and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down, and I bet you gon' see diamonds

I'm off the codeine refill my cup
Robotic coupe while I'm pullin' up
Was feelin' down so I spiked my cup
Was in need of you so I hit you up
Hollywood, I'm in a loft
Catchin' plays, Randy Moss
Bag 'em up, ship 'em off
Fuck the law, what's the cost?
Please don't be freaks on me, ooh get the snakes on me
Been "What's the cost?" Get 'em in, get 'em off
Pop a perc I take off
Got a bitch , then she claim she from Mars
That bitch a liar, though
Say she a rider, bro
Say that she also a model, bro
Say that she used to be a lifeguard, savin' you
You don't see me drownin' hoe
Marley don't shoot 'em, but I still keep a chopper on me
Trap in silence, if they want you know that I'm a-(ooh)
Niggas hatin', debatin', don't wanna see me prosper
My flow is ill as fuck, niggas better call a doctor
Over when the fat lady sing done sing like an opera
Back in the G, I was flippin', runnin' through the projects
In the backyard with Tune ballin' in a pair of Balmain's
Last time I bought my bitches, I swear I love 'em all, mane
I be high as fuck, I be fly as fuck
My bitches is nasty, fuckin' her from the back, she callin' me daddy
With two in Miami, all for the family, do it for granny
I go with my move, nothin' to prove
Droppin' Choos, wearin' jewels
Couple thou' on the shoes
Shawty wet like a pool
Bitches see me and they drool
We don't 
YM, never lose
It's my time, no snooze
It's my time, no snooze
YM, never lose, yeah

Huh, huh, so much fake love, I've been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone, and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down, and I bet you gon' see diamonds
Huh, huh, so much fake love, I've been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone, and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down, and I bet you gon' see diamonds
The craziest place I've ever seen a Lil Wayne tattoo on someone is... you ready? So, I'm 'bout to explain it, um... inside the lips of their pussy. Um, that's just the craziest place. So like, even when you see the pussy, she can show any man her pussy, he won't see it. She has to literally open her pussy up for you to see the name. Shout out- shout my homegirl, that's my homegirl, one time for her. I love you, girl. What's the craziest place I haven't seen a Lil Wayne tattoo is when people come up to me and say "You know I got your name on me, but, like, I can't show you right now 'cause I'm in work," or, "I can't show you right now 'cause," whatever. You ain't got my fuckin' name on you, shut the fuck up1Embed
