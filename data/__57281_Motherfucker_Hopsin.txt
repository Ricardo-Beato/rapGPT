Dad how come nobody likes me?
'Cause you're a motherfucker
Now am I really? yeah yeah
Now am I really? yeah yeah
Yo now am I really? yeah yeah
'Cause you're a motherfucker
Sing my song like, whoa whoa
Yo sing my song like, whoa whoa
Come on sing my song like, whoa, whoa

Yo I'm Hop, sin of my family, get it from daddy
When sippin' some alcohol, when he flips on my mammi
I'm just assuming that, I'm a stupid ass who gets a boom from rap
Fuck getting a regular job (shit I'm too cool for that)
I hope I'm gambling right with all this rap shit
'Cause if I failed then I just wasted half of my life
And I'm a dropout, so that just means I'd have to shoot dice
Up on the corner with they line, or just stab you tonight
The type of guy who gives a fuck about my ass only
Get my shit straight and bypass homies
Always talking bout buy that for me
Nigga buy your own shit life is so sick why?

('Cause you're a motherfucker)
How come I always gotta be the one to stand out
Offend a damn crowd when opening up my damn mouth
How come nobody takes me serious wherever I go? I gotta know
('Cause you're a motherfucker)
How come I gotta be the one that everybody hated
Be the one that all the girls moms saying not to date?
How come this shit is always happening to me
Man I'm just being me
('Cause you're a motherfucker)
You might also like
Teachers say I need to act my age
Bitch fuck you I'll smack your face
Until you have no taste buds to taste with
I can't budge so face it
I'm raw straight from the basement
My style stay ugly, most niggas can't touch me
I dedicated my life to this shit, faithfully
I act the way I wanna rap and rap the way I wanna act
And most of you niggas just don't do none of that
I'm setting up a trap for these niggas to stumble over
Who thinkin' they up with Hova, these niggas ain't fucking sober
They not in they mind, and my style boggles the mind
The hottest with rhymes, you not 'cause you not in your prime
I hopped in the ride, and rapid took off into the night
'Cause I have realized that none of you artist are tight
I'm making it mine, I'm sharp like the carve of the knife
Why you mad at me?

('Cause you're a motherfucker)
How come I always gotta be the one to stand out
Offend a damn crowd when opening up my damn mouth
How come nobody takes me serious wherever I go? I gotta know
('Cause you're a motherfucker)
How come I gotta be the one that everybody hated
Be the one that all the girls moms saying not to date?
How come this shit is always happening to me
Man I'm just being me
('Cause you're a motherfucker)
Like a nigga who fucks his mom, my flows much the bomb
Who wanna fuck with Hop baby
Not nobody that you would know, or no one I would know
Or no one we would know baby
I don't fit into big crowds 'cause I'm an innocent child
Can't understand what this shit is about
I'm always the one who getting cut off when trying to speak
At any fucking day, or time of the week, so I decided to be
A fucking asshole, retarded bastard
Why become something that I hardly mastered, it's all a disaster
But I'm gonna make it all go right
And I'm finna become that one nigga that y'all don't like
'Cause all those times y'all dissed me, laughed at me just to make your ass happy
I'm passed Stacy conceited mack daddy, is what I'm finna to become
It'll be funny so take a seat and relax, and sip some more hennessy son
I must have a malfunction 'cause I give a fuck about nothing
I'll give a fuck about giving a fuck about something
But still nobody wants to hang with me, and why's that?
'Cause you're a motherfucker

('Cause you're a motherfucker)
How come I always gotta be the one to stand out
Offend a damn crowd when opening up my damn mouth
How come nobody takes me serious wherever I go? I gotta know
('Cause you're a motherfucker)
How come I gotta be the one that everybody hated
Be the one that all the girls moms saying not to date?
How come this shit is always happening to me
Man I'm just being me
('Cause you're a motherfucker)
So get high (yeah, yeah)
So get high (yeah, yeah)
So get high (yeah, yeah)
('Cause you're a motherfucker)1Embed
