5 ContributorsGonna Get Mine LyricsGonna live my life, make it through the night
It's gon' be alright, cause I'm a get mine
When it comes that day, carry me away
It's gon' be OK, cause I done did mine
I extort niggas, so don't come up short
You cowards ain't got the heart to do shit but talk
Give a fuck who you know and who your mans is
It's just you and me here and he's gon' handle his
From semi to fully, bitch, I've always been a bully
Picked on niggas, couldn't do nothin' to me
So what, you a little older now, and what?
Still sittin' down to piss, stand up
Shit, I throw at 'em hard, go at 'em hard
I ain't gotta blow at 'em hard
Got 'em droppin' their guard
Cause niggas respect the dog in me
And the cat in you that I'm able to see
That's why I'm on the ground and you up in the tree
Who the fuck you think you talkin' to, nigga this is me
Come on, lil' man, don't be like that
What did daddy say, daddy said he'll be right back
Listen...

Gonna live my life, make it through the night
It's gon' be alright, cause I'm a get mine
When it comes that day, carry me away
It's gon' be OK, cause I done did mine
You might also likeI rob niggas that I hang with
You know X up to the same shit
EFL, I bang with
Pull out the thang quick, clear out the whole room
Step back, ch-ch, what, nigga boom!
Lift niggas off their feet for thinkin' it's sweet
My hands on the heat, your mans in the street
I ain't got a problem with poppin', we're all goin' to jail
My shit stay off safety, my aim as well
I get down like I used to
Y'all niggas think somethin' soft
We can get off cause dog, I get loose too
Denna denna dehhh, like the Juice Crew
When I cruise through, bitch, you gonna lose too
Blam blam, that's how a nigga gettin' at 'em
Blam blam, I stay spittin' somethin' at 'em
Whatever, vato, I know you're pussy, nigga, I can see through you
Whatchu expect me to do!?
Gonna live my life, make it through the night
It's gon' be alright, cause I'm a get mine
When it comes that day, carry me away
It's gon' be OK, cause I done did mine
Cats is sloppy, stoppin' me is outta the question
I'm always gon' be the best and that's a confession
I ain't talkin' shit, nig, I'm talkin' what's real
Dog with the grill, walk what I feel
Fuck you and them niggas you run with
Niggas get done quick over some dumb shit
I'm startin' to smell pussy 'round here
A little bit of fear, figured I'd throw that in the air
Now, walk with it
Gonna live my life, make it through the night
It's gon' be alright, cause I'm a get mine
When it comes that day, carry me away
It's gon' be OK, cause I done did mineEmbed
