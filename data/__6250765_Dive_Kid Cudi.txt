Hey

Seen nothing like that shorty with the fat back movin' to the vibes (Vibes)
Say, "I'm just up in my habitat, playin' little Ratatat, kickin' with my tribe" (Ride)
I'm sayin' it's a known fact, show 'em, nigga, no act, sucker, fall in line (Yeah)
I'm out to get mine, woah, woah, niggas seein' me shine (Ride)
Catch me baked outside, wonderin' daily, why, why?
Will she let me get behind? Baby, just close your eyes (Eyes)
You see we takin' off, leave the stress, no time (Bye)
This ain't televised, see I'm her surprise, I

Ooh-ooh, ooh, that vibe
Ooh-ooh, ooh, that vibe
Ooh-ooh, I need those fuckin' vibes
Doo-doo-doo-doo, and we ragin' 'til daylight
Things are gettin' gnarly, got my whiskey by my side
Soarin' through my world and I'm 'bout to take a dive
This is just the sadness in me, sad times
Just another evening and I'm leanin', oh (Let's get it)

Uh, ready, go, set, we won't hold you, neither (Uh)
Salute when you see that nigga (Yeah)
Tell him, "Go off," when you see him, greet him (Mm)
Talkin' shit, fuck ya, legend of the cold one, nice
This my life, all my nights
Walkin' like a disco ball, all this ice, aye
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (This the story)
Ayy, ayy, ayy (Woo), ayy (Of a man)
Ayy, ayy, ayy (Woo), ayy (And you know it)
Ayy, ayy, ayy (Move, move), ayy (Catch the show)
Slightly paranoid, can't believe 'em simply (Yeah)
Nah, bullshit, miss me (Nah, nah), ahh
Call it what it is then, lies
This my fantasy high, sayin' goodbye
I lay at night, it intensifiesYou might also like23Embed
