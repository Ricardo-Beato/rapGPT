2 ContributorsNew Money Lyrics
Hey, soon as I step out on the scene
Cameras flash, get my cash right
Livin' like I'm stuck in a dream, must be that new money
Large and on the turnpike, shootin' up the shine bright
Mama how I wish you could see this new money
When I hop up out the jet jet, new money
Out the friendly skies, hey, know it's new money
Never goin' broke, my bank got new money
Mama how I wish you could see this new money

I stack rubber band racks, all tax get evaded
My sort of way of saying 'Fuck the system that enslaved us'
We want it all but won't let it all change us
So we don't respect players that's playin' to say they played it
To confident fools, I choose not to say shit
The rocks in my jewels are viewed as my language
I've been the shit, so I don't take it to the brain
When these pretty flight attendants compliment me on my fragrance
Louis on the baggage claim, Pirellis on the pavement
Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier scent
A hundred thousand plus monthly, yeah, I make it
But kept it on some S-dome on top of six braids shit
They see me on TV and swear to God I'm changin'
But ask BET if I was backstage blazin'
This new money got these old niggas hatin'
You better know my aim is amazin'
Bow, nigga
You might also like
Hey, soon as I step out on the scene
Cameras flash, get my cash right
Livin' like I'm stuck in a dream, must be that new money
Large and on the turnpike, shootin' up the shine bright
Mama how I wish you could see this new money
When I hop up out the jet jet, new money
Out the friendly skies, hey, know it's new money
Never goin' broke, my bank got new money
Mama how I wish you could see this new money+Embed
