6 ContributorsNever Let Me Down (Cinematic) Lyrics
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Down, down, down, down, down


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Down, down, down, down, down


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Down, down, down, down, down


When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Down, down, down, down, down
