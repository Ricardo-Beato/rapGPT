36 ContributorsFuck Me Lyrics
Chief Keef
(Oh it's Holiday Season, nigga)
Sosa
Youngest rich nigga I know
Swerving down the highway
We don't give a fuck, nigga, wassup?
It's dope, Glo boy (Bang), (Glo Boyz, wassup?), I been with it since jump street
Right when we was sellin' D, (O'Block), right there on Front$treet (Baby), ayy
You drunk bitch, (300, turn this up!), why this bitch don't want me
I just had a six some, (Holiday), them hoes was actin' country

Glo boy, I been with it since jump street (Yoon)
Right when we was sellin' D, right there on Front$treet (Uh), ayy
You drunk bitch, what bitch don't want me? (Huh?)
I just had a six some, them hoes was acting country (Thot)
It's ugly 'cause that bitch say she love me
'Cause I don't like to text, I don't want no company
I dicked her down she like, "Sosa, you drugged me" (Bang, bang)
She told all her friends now them hoes wanna fuck me

Ayy, ayy, I'm bankroll, shawty
I got so much money, I bought a bitch to match my 'Rari, Sosa
I'm can't go, shawty
A nigga try to rob me, he'll be brains blown, shawty, on O
I got two Glocks .40's
They both got 30's in 'em, run up, you shot, shawty on O
And all I ride is 'Raris
But I just bought a Beamer truck, I'm sittin' it on some Forgis
I got the set with me, this shit ain't Aquafina but I got get-wet with me (Bang)
Bitch, I got what you need, is you gon' suck my dick? And if you're not you gotta leave
'Cause I'm a cash cow, bitch, I be high off the earth, she hit my weed, she passed out
I'ma laugh now, I know this bitch, I told you bitch, "Can't stand me, sit yo ass down"

Right when we was sellin' D, right there on Front$treet
You drunk bitch, what bitch don't want me? (Huh?)

It's ugly 'cause that bitch say she love me
'Cause I don't like to text, I don't want no company
I dicked her down she like, "Sosa, you drugged me" (Bang, bang)
She told all her friends now them hoes wanna fuck me5Embed
