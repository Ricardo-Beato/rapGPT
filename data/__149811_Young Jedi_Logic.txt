Real talk, just RattPack, besides that, nobody I trust

Back again like I never left, Young Sinatra, that’s to the death
We turnt up ’til we go deaf, rep RattPack ’til my last breath
I cut records like Kid Cudi, day and night, that’s all the time
From the underground to the mainstream, my same team get all the shine
They wanted beef but I never knew, I just keep the peace and get revenue
Stay true, they never do, cut all ties, I sever you
These rappers like women, that's off of their pill, we keeping it real but they flow is irregular
Grab the mic and I murder on the regular while these bitches hit me up on my cellular
I can’t take the time that I take to rhyme and just bullshit, man, that blow my mind
I’m 23 like MJ, that’s no rest like overtime
Writing rhymes on the tour bus, we stay real to the core of us
They talk shit ’bout RattPack but every day, man, there’s more of us
That money come and that money go, but this music shit, man, that’s all I know
I been broke and I got paid, like a Goodfella that got made
I’m draped up and I’m dripped out, went to school, got kicked out
Told my mama, she flipped out, said “fuck it all” and I dipped out
But I’m back though, whole time, fuck bitches, I just rhyme
Brand new state of mind, my lifestyle is so divine
'Cause I’ve lived and I’ve learned, now I hustle and earn
Cause once you in the limelight, everybody concerned
With your wellbeing, and if you feel okay
Bitch, you wasn’t here a year ago, why are you here today?
I got professor paper, your money need an extension
I’m selling success, save up and pay attention
Money can’t buy happiness, but that shit can support it
'Cause what’s a family of five if you can’t even afford it?

Feeling good, feeling great
Feeling like a XXL Freshman on your bitch ass, nigga
Try me

Creeping on the come-up with my nigga Logic, time to get it popping
Got your city watching, hit the stage, them titties popping
What it do? Bruh, I fuck witchu, don’t let these haters knock ya
(Keep it gangsta) Keep it, keep it G, don’t keep them lames around ya
(Fuck the world) Fuck the, fuck the world, y’all gon’ feel my passion
(Pass the blunt) I’ma create that shit that’s fuckin’ everlasting
I’m overboard with the tactics, walk out the house
And I ain’t even matching, but I’m stunting 'cause I’m the coolest and the youngest
I told ‘em I was a threat, they scared of what’s next
I’m Christoper Dorner in effect if you speakin’ down on my name (Pop pop pop pop)
Walking down this road, I’m the only one in my lane
And my fingers getting itchy, that’s that money coming to get me
Mr. Wright, Mr. Dizzy Wright, Vegas nigga shit (Making noise)
Wait a minute, ain’t them niggas on the list?
Making moves, making super moves, who the fuck is you?
Nigga what? Nigga, nigga, what? Them niggas the truth
It’s an honor to be a part of the heart of the young Sinatra (Wright)
You ain’t gotta smoke weed, we gon’ celebrate with this vodka (Uh)
Grinding for some time, and I’m hella straight with the dollars
So if you call me and you need me, then I got ya
Don’t talk about being the realest, niggas gon’ feel us regardless
We gotta keep on killing, I got the mind of a martian
I’m spaced out somewhere in a world that I never been
Living out my dreams and I’m still tryna settle in
See it’s amazing, studio sessions (Uh), beautiful blessings (Uh)
I’m faded, usually quiet (Uh), but I’ve got this message (Uh)
So I speak it like I know it
Got my shot, I took it and I didn’t fuckin’ blow it, now everything is in motion
Calling out my homies who understand what it means (Yeah)
To get off your ass, get on your grind and follow your dreams (Yeah)
Making it a fact (Uh) to be great at what you achieve (Yeah)
If I lead, would you follow with a ease? (Uh, uh, yeah)
Open your mind, elevate to the level of this rhyme
Keep it G to the dime, many seek, never find
Never knowing when I’m flowing, feeling heroic, never ask
Chilling with your bitch, I can’t help but grab up on that ass
Swerving at 120 while she’s rolling weed on the dash
Many never follow their dreams but follow the cash
And this is the reason the Reaper is coming for they ass
Top dollar, money, bitches, Impalas, fuck it all, let me holler
And show you how we do it where I come from
We getting money for the long term, not just no lump sum
Uh, how you feeling? Make a killing, bitches higher than the ceiling
I’m Goku, you fuckers is Krillin with the spirit bomb
Fuck around, throw your body on the lawn
Right in front of your mom, motherfuckers, I’m gone
RattPack
