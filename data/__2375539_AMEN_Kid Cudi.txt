I can see through you (See through)
I can see through you
Yeah, oh-oh

Yeah, oh-oh
Yeah, nah

Amen, yeah yeah, amen
I will slay them, I will save men (Ah)
The demons walk around with an appetite, I see 'em
Demons walk around in daylight, I see 'em
Amen, I will slay them (Yeah-eh)

Oh, beware of the manic man, uh, oh
A man can equal bandstand, oh
Rip faces up with my bare hands, uh, oh
You fake niggas and bitches (I see you ho! I see you)
Yeah, I know you're wearing a mask, da-ra
Yeah, I know you're wearing a mask, da-da-ra
Get out with your phony ass, da-da-ra
Keep your stories and your phony plans, dum-da-ra

Amen (Hol' up), amen
I will slay them, I will save men
Demons walk around with an appetite
Demons walk around in daylight
And I will slay them, I will save men
