4 ContributorsSculpting With Fire Lyrics
I think I've had enough to drink
Just gimme one more drink to guarantee that I stink
Smack me on the back of my head
Go tell my therapist it's time to take my ass to bed
It's all graffiti underneath the bridge
Like if it wasn't for my kids, I wouldn't need to exist
I'd probably live in the backseat of my taxi
Get my meter up to keep enough to buy myself some happy
The lonely fisherman rockin' with the sea change
Karaoking "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"
The dystopian Obi-Wan Kenobi
Fell asleep in the car outside an Ethiopian bar
I gotta keep my third eye on the first prizе
Ain't the type to break ground just to lеt the dirt fly
Trying to identify the shape of what's to come
Just wait until they drag those lakes for the guns

There ain't nowhere to run
It's on purpose on purpose
I try not to take it personal
And I don't know
And I don't know
And I don't know but I'm trying to know
I'm dying to know, know
You might also like
This could be the last song that I ever wrote
Only heaven knows I'm like whatever though
Everybody's gotta travel across it
When I go I hope I go from supernatural causes
But man, I'm exhausted
It's all about how you handle your losses
And whether or not you recognize that you're toxic
You're a product of putting the prophecy below the profit
The pirate treasure's always buried next to monsters
Or lava the promise of trauma
If I could quote a late-century philosopher
He said you can save the drama for your mama
That's why I'm focused on the fire the circumstance
You're not entitled to a second or a third chance
I think I can feel the universe expand
If I could do it all over again, I'd learn to dance

So many other realities exist simultaneously

(What did you say?)
She said it's just your imagination
There's no such thing as good or evil, it's just people
When I consider everything that we've lived through
I wish that I could find the strength to forgive you
But really though, I love you
Don't even know you but I need your affection
Appreciate your business and I cherish the connection
That enables my ability to visit this dimension
That's a whole lot of smoke, huh?
I hope that it was worth the resources you smoked up
Force the opening and stole some closure
It's a cold, cold world when you're alone in your corner
I still remember how to shoplift
Don't be astonished if my socks fit
Let's bring it back to the original topic
It's a graham cracker, marshmallow and some chocolateEmbed
