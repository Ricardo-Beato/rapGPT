13 ContributorsI Know Lyrics
Yeah, ayy, ayy
Buss a move, Young Thugga
'Bout to rock the 'Rari, ayy

I'm one step over you you try to knock me down I'ma shoot back
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
All these motherfuckers screaming behind me I can't help but look back
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know...

You wanna be right here with the Young Thug but you can't
And I'm black but I fuck with Asia
And if you blink, you'll get a shot
Or ten letters after A, you might get that K-shot
'Cause you're too tough, I'm too rough
No crew cut but I will give your crew cuts
He used to be buff, and now he's too snuff
I used to be broke, but now I'm too up
'Cause I do stuff like fuck on hoes
And I'll fuck his ho, then she'll fuck my ho
Then they are on gold 'til I don't want no more
And I don't want no more of your bitch's hours
Bring her to the loaf and get it right back sour
And we snort it like some whiff 'til she don't know vowels
We know her name but she don't know ours
But she fuck for hours, but she fuck for hours (Eat her alive)

I'm one step over you you try to knock me down I'ma shoot back
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
All these motherfuckers screaming behind me I can't help but look back
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know..

And I'ma purple syrup sipper, I get cash to my niggas and it ain't 'cause they some killers
Man I fuck with them niggas, they like y'all
No hunter, but I stay with them niggas them my dawgs
For real
If you not with us they'll get shot
Kidnap them niggas and go fuck on they wall
Big bruh just got a L so motherfuck the law
Cuz keep on talkin' shit like he forgettin' them flaws, ooh
Rent low means he got another one
Levi's they lookin' like Louis, I got the Tommy Gun
This is for the niggas with L's my brother got one
Got me wonderin' why this cracker die and he got shot one
Woah

I'm one step over you you try to knock me down I'ma shoot back
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
All these motherfuckers screaming behind me I can't help but look back
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know..2Embed
