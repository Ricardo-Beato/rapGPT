5 ContributorsSelfish Lyrics
Lately I been wondering what the fuck you keep doing
Got me running round in circles shit is fucking confusing
I can tell that you ain't happy you don't wanna go through this
I know you think that I don't love you
I been wanting to prove it, but uh
Lately my mind been on other things
And I want you but I want a few other things
Tell the truth there some girls that I want to bang
I ain't say I'm going to, but I don't wanna change
And I know I'm not giving you the attention you deserve
And I understand if you gotta kick me to the curb
But I know you don't wanna you just wish that this would work
We been going through it, but I guess you live it and you learn
Man this shit is so berserk
Things been bad but they getting kinda worse
We can end things now, before you leave town
But, if I hear something it's gon' hit me where it hurts cause

You say, you say, you say that
We should take a break, we should take a break
And just hope it helps cause
I can't, (I can't nah), I can't, (I can't do it), I can't
I don't wanna think, I don't wanna see
You with no one else
You might also like
Here I go thinking with my dick again
Here you go making me believe you wanna get with him
You ain't fucking with them fellas
But you love to make me jealous, I been seeming so indifferent
Guessing you ain't getting all the loving that you wish you did
Clearly we got issues you ain't bring to my attention
Yeah until you got fucked, but I'm the one that's fucked up
So don't think that I've been innocent
I know you saw this coming
I know being happy's really all you wanted
(And you know I, I wish I didn't, you know, fuck that shit up for you every time but uh)
I wish we could rewind things back
When you fell in love with a guy named Jack
I know lately I've been trying to have it my way but
Maybe I just really want what I can't have

You say, you say, you say that
We should take a break, we should take a break
And just hope it helps cause
I can't, (I can't nah), I can't, (I can't do it), I can't
I don't wanna think, I don't wanna see
You with no one else3Embed
