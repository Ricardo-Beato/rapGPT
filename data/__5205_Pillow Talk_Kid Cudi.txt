24 ContributorsPillow Talk Lyrics
Hm
Damn girl, where did you learn to do all that?
Ay, can I tell you something? Listen

Girl the sex was crazy, better yet amazing
Don't be sad, I ain't going nowhere, let's just lay and talk
Girl I know you feel it, this chemistry that we got
So don't be shy, I ain't going nowhere, I'm here for the night
So move closer, bring your body to mine, let me hold you right
Don't be mad, I ain't going nowhere, I'ma sleep here by your side

You probably think I'm shady, girl, I know, but I (Ain't gon' fuckin' bounce)
I'm feeling you, I wanna get to know you, so (Let's have pillow talk)
You probably think I'm shady, girl, I know, but I (Ain't gon' fuckin' bounce)
I'm feeling you, I wanna get to know you, so (Let's have pillow talk)

When I saw you after my show, your friends were acting like hoes
But you were different, you weren't impressed by all my money or fancy shit
Girl your skin is so smooth, and you smell good just like some new shoes (Just like my Bathing Apes)
I see you smiling, is that a sign that you feeling me too? Girl I hope so

You probably think I'm shady, girl, I know, but I (Ain't gon' fuckin' bounce)
I'm feeling you, I wanna get to know you, so (Let's have pillow talk)

So move closer bring your body to mine
Just like my Bathing Apes7Embed
