15 ContributorsThese Hoes Lyrics
Oh, Young Money, money so old
All these motherfuckin' M’s and all these motherfuckin' O's
I can give some to these hoes
But I got that dope dick, and all these hoes want is this dough
All these hoes come as they go (Yeah)
All these hoes want is snow, I'm a hundred below
All these hoes fuckin' for sure (Yeah)
All these hoes want is to say that they fuck with a GOAT

All of my bitches tote choppers (Yeah)
I walk around with an army, your bitches cadavеrs
I had to sit down and convo (Oh)
With Mother Earth and that bitch told me I was adopted (Oh)
I worе some Vans to a wedding (Oh)
It was at the House of Versace, me and Kanye was spotted (Oh)
He offered me some wings (Oh)
I told him, "Don't even bother, I'm already flyin'" (Woah)
You better not bleed on my carpet (No)
That type of shit get your pussy ass thrown to the lions
It feels like my throne is on fire
You tried to call it a day, but my phone was on silent (Hello?)
I'ma keep fuckin' these hoes (Woah)
I'ma keep guttin' these hoes, I ain't stuntin' these hoes (Woah)
I can't stop stuntin’ on these hoes (Woah)
Baby, I'm stuck in this mode, like gum on my sole (Fuck)
Lightin' up blunts I just rolled (Woah)
Got me high up on these hoes, slam dunkin' these hoes (Woah)
I done got enough of these hoes (Woah)
I ain't tryna get stuck with these hoes, I get stuck in these holes
I'ma keep fuckin' these hoes
I'ma keep lovin’ these hoes, then dumpin' these hoes
I don't even stop for these hoes
Can't stop stuntin' I ain't got no stop button for these hoes
I don't give a fuck who she knows
You know I fuck who she know, give a fuck if she know
I don't give a fuck 'bout these hoes
No ceilings, I ain't put a roof over none of these hoes
I ain’t even start on these hoes
I cum on these hoes, you know I ain't finna cum in these hoes (No)
I don't know what come with these hoes
I fuck every ho that come with these hoes, right in front of these hoes
You be doin' lunch with these hoes
Rollin' up blunts with these hoes, smokin' dubs with this ho
Nigga, I don't need a bunch of these hoes
I need to cover these hoes, I need to play some double-dutch with this rope
I'ma double cup on this ho
I'm over my bitch, layin' under his sofa
She bounce on my dick like a fucking '64
Gave me head like a marshmallow, then she dip low, go DJ
Pajama party on my PJ
I've been in Miami party, this is private
I got the banana clip in this machine gun
Extra machine gun, if this machine break (Brrr)
I'ma keep bussin', you better get lower than Donald be duckin'
You soft as some dough, and I'm hot as an oven
Your homie’s a s'more and your slime is a muffin
And I buss a lil' bitch, 'cause I like it, she love it
That bih gon' get busy in private, in public
I stuck it, I stick it, I strike it, I struck it
She suck it, she lick it, she bite, and I'm punchin'
I smack it up, flip it up, rub it down, whip it
Cookin' the coke, get the fuck out my kitchen
I'm whippin' the white girl, domestic violence
Nosy ass neighbors, stay the fuck out my business
Just business, I chop the boy up like some scissor (Yeah)
It ain't nothin' to get your throat cut like a ribbon (Yeah)
I aim at your nose and I buss when you sniffin'
Your brain's on the hoes and your blood on the bitches, uh
We are not on the same
Bum-bum-bum-bum and we're out of your lane
I'ma come through with so much ice on, lookin' like I don't wanna ever be a Hot Boy again

All these hoes want is snow, I'm a hundred below
All these hoes fuckin' for sure (Yeah)
All these hoes want is to say that they fuck with a GOAT

You can't put a ceiling on the greatest
So we took the fuckin' ceiling off3Embed
