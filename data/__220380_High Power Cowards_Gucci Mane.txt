High power, high power, high power
High power, high power, high power
Smoking gas, it's high power
Man you's a high power coward
(Verse)
I'm drinkin soda pop with purple whippin coke and bakin soda
I'm ridin in a old school with a rari motor
My neice earrings look like a sunny water
I gave my bitch a walking paper, you can marathon her
I smoking medical marijuana and I fish for squared roofer
I hook a nigga plug then I take his street corner
They call me Gucci Mane, I'm a murderer boo
I'm well known for breakins, I'm a burglarer too
I guess this brick is a squirter cuz it's taking water
I'd rather take yo shit than roll with you and work MacDonald's
I'm smoking Oreol cookie and beat em up on er
I got my own private harvest, this a kush garden
Guwop!

I'm good for that cookin dope but I'm not finna sniff it
I whip it, flip it and ship it and charge you extra for shipping
Gucci got a bitch, who put bricks in her building
Pussy wax Brazilian, I rush that go back to Sicily
Tell me how the mob feel you datin a mooly
This mouliani here, he got drug money boomin
If you fakin it the real gon recognize that, that's eminent
Big Guwop man the palm, say my face got unlimited
You's a rental bitch, rental car, rental dick
Want a nigga but can't keep a nigga cuz you full of it
I'm the type of nigga buy a cheatah to match my cheatah print
Want to come and call PETA because Gucci bout to kill some shit
