5 ContributorsFly Everything Lyrics
Let's go, baby, let's go
Yo

Big paper, skyscrapers
The black Jerry Buss, I can buy the Lakers
Fly everything
Stand on the Bentley and toast to stones in every ring
Forty helicopters with choppers, back to Medell√≠n
Undercover task force reveals they get chills when on the heels of a killa
Way iller with his mask off
Three stooge of these niggas, leave 'em in the dust on the crash course
I don't even ask for the pussy, wizzes pass off
Cinco de Mayo, I'm into the bayou, one hell of a bio
I live that life you can stuff in the vial
Black 590 Mossberg'll knock off your smile
Tony wrist game water like it was dipped in the Nile
Forty-inch cable is fatal (Uh-huh), I need a neck brace
The gold I wore'll weigh more than your table
Jameson bags of scotch, the red dot on the label
If Chi-Town is Chiraq, Staten Island is Beirut

All we want's the dead presidents, take measurements
You follow the old, we makin' new testaments
Supreme specimens, Wu-Tang regiments
Watch your mouth when you speakin' to excellence (Yo)

I probably left a couple scenes, but that's only through back exits
Mommy cryin', homie died, couldn't make it past eleven
Twenty-one, twenty gun salute, bring him back in seconds
Off that juice, hang 'em off the roof how niggas send a message
We be wildin', keep the toolie on us case you wanna check us
Off the line and get your homie clapped just for sending texts
Every spot Mr. JJ Watt, known to get them Texans
Quiet down, everybody now, God gon' send a message
In my country for what you worth, but you ain't life threatenin'
You ain't running, just drag your feet 'cause you ain't light stepping
Send 'em all to come dim your lights, you gon' need a light expection
Just give 'em a couple shots, we gon' give 'em light injections
I'm cleaning these niggas messes, but soon as I switched my groove
Got out and moved, these niggas became the death wish
Niggas became reckless, young, black and flexin'
Nigga (Young, black and flexin')

All we want's the dead presidents, take measurements
You follow the old, we makin' new testaments
Supreme specimens, Wu-Tang regiments
Watch your mouth when you speakin' to excellenceEmbed
