16 ContributorsWaterpark Lyrics
Yeah nigga I'm out here shining
You see me bitch, I don't see you though
Fake ass, fraud ass rap niggas
You on Twitter though, where you hiding at?
I'ma find you, little word of advice bitch nigga, don't sleep!

Heavy Duty shots out the Uzi into your momma house
Clip your momma on the couch
Now your momma running out the back door
Car-bomb strapped to her black Ford
Won't make it out the hospital tonight
You see I try to be a civil dude but bitches can get it too
Lying to the Johnny's like these rappers do in interviews
It's wavy in the beach, but nigga's crazy in the beach
It'd be smart to keep 380's where you sleep
I need a bitch like Brandy
We can make a baby in the Jeep
She's drove me crazy since "Moesha"
I'd really like to meet you
Niggas asking me for features
But nobody's talking monetary
Probably the reason why you never hear me

Tell all the girls clap your hands, you coming out of them pants
I don't ask or make demands, I'm the mothafuckin' man
Can somebody tell them broads, they coming out of them draws
I swear to God I love you all, where my round of applause at
We cashing all checks, don't call the laws yet
My niggas dogs, no need to get them involved
Cause them guns come out like the summertime sun
Yeah them guns come out like the summertime
You might also like
I'm taking niggas bitches like Bowser
I pound her, you hound her
I never been sympathetic for simping
These niggas act like the women they crying over
Invite her over, dig her out then kick her out
Raw dog her then dog her, don't call until them kids is out
See I take a different route with everything I do
Where some little shit to me could be like everything to you
You could give a wedding ring to a girl you'll never screw
And I apologize for that, it must suck to be a fool
I'm tactical, been cracking hoes since secondary school
We trapping hoes, selling 4 and 5's for the price of 2
I was taught that the life you live is the life you choose
I chose the path of a winner, now shake that ass for a nigga
