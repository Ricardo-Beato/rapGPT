26 ContributorsAddicted Lyrics
When I was on drugs so bad, you know, I talked different
I was drinking lean like crazy every day, I was out my mind

Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Fast cars, bad bitches, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling

Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Diamond chains, tennis chains, assault rifles, gambling
Sellin' dope and trickin' folks that run in my family
My daddy was an alcoholic, momma she's a junkie daughter
Cousin smokin' crack, I guess she forgot all my aunt done taught her
Plus I got two brothers that I don't know from a addicted father
And all the pain I caused my mother, bet she wish she had a daughter
Sellin' sets out my momma window, tryna' get a new starter
Treat Sun Valley like Decatur, mountain park like port Arthur
I know my family dysfunctional
So God please help these country folks
Tired and broke, in need of hope
Sheetrock, heroin, crack, and coke

Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling

Gucci Mane a local joker, man, that nigga regional (loco)
And people won't be happy til I'm confined to Georgia Regional
The third week out of rehab, man, he forget the shit they teachin' him
Like why you smokin' blunts and sippin' lean and you a millionaire
Wrecked my yellow lamb, high on drugs I didn't give a care
Smashed my black Ferrari two weeks later, now it need repair
Demons in my ear, got me seein' things wasn't even there
People in my circle say they care, but they don't really care
But I can't blame nobody but myself, it starts with myself
Cause rap can bring you wealth, but that wealth can destroy your health
Lookin' in the mirror at myself, had to catch my breath
And tell myself that "Gucci, you an addict!" That's the first step

Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling5Embed
