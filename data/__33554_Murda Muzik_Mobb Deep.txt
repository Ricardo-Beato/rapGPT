8 ContributorsMurda Muzik Lyrics
Record this right here
Man I want niggas to hear this shit right here
Knahmsayin? Cause these niggas be forgettin son
Knahmsayin? .. Can't blame niggas doe (we here son)
Y'know? Truth always reveal itself though
That's what we here for
But umm.. we gon' take this little intermission
To say what the fuck we got to say, y'know?
(Let me, let me here something then)
It's like this Dunn

Infamous 'til the name wear out, time and again without doubt
I take the murder one route, where clowns pulled out and copped out
Poppin they, little heads out they hole
Stickin they chest out, actin like they in control
But hold up, I've been doin' this since we was kids
And all you other niggas gotta ask if you could live
Your projects is on our dicks, you need to quit
And let us rep that for them, your raps ain't shit
Your background's incorrect, your song push no effect
On the people, don't try to play my part
Don't try to say my words that I lived and survived
Y'all niggas got some nerve, be careful at night
You might bump into a true to life nigga like P
Get beat over your head wit gun handles
Check the manual you went about it all wrong
We put you on the life, taught you how to drink right
And how to speak like a nigga livin' street life
How to chase down liquor wit more liquor
As a youth I was over proof, now I'm sober than your hoa
But still pound on a nigga 'til he throw up
Straighten up there's too much to lose
Get your head on right, we got the world to gain
And I'ma take mines while you sit around and complain
And I innovate raps while your song is playin'
Looks tastes and feels to me like no frills
Take that bullshit back to the two inch reel
Hit the studio hard, crash the track board like a smashed car
Then maybe next rhyme you could fuck with the God
P wit a capital "P"
And don't ever in your life try to rock with me
On no days there's no rap page I can't top
I, splash the half ass trash you dropped
You get chopped in half, your little raff ain't last long
My shit came out and you got escorted to the door
You just a fuckin' clown here to entertain us all
I bring the gravity Dunn you're gonna fall
Anytime y'all niggas wanna mic brawl
Don't forget to me it's Bloodsport bring your dogs
Nigga
(Yea nigga, it's like that y'all niggas, what)

It's no doubt, I hold my niggas cause they hold me too
Like if you show love for me then I'll show love for you
And if you in a situation, just be patient
Give me a minute and I'll be there with no hesitation
And all them bitches that you hittin we done ran through that
Plus dissed them, that's why they can't stand our raps
As for you couldn't give a fuck on how you feel
Never allowed, and break em up like a whack album
Go against to get punished, fuck you
Take it out on who run wit, then touch you
Ain't no room for the both of us you pop too much shit
I just handle shit and put a clamp, on them loose lips
I sink em like the Titanic, you be deep in some shit
I didn't stutter can't hear nigga read my lips
Who you runnin' with - shit you won't knock this click
You just frontin' with imaginary pies you flip
Aiyo P my mind and yours put together's like a pack wild piranhas
Carnivores it's me thirstin'
It only worsen, you cats'll get the closed curtain
While your catch me on your networking, you dick jerkin
Your future's uncertain - get a grip close your mouth
Cause you know them shits sink ships
It's foul - tryna go against the morale
Move the crowd do my thing leave your ears aroused

It's Murda Muzak, niggas on my block relate to it
Murda Muzak, my peoples on the cell block use it
Homicide Muzak, Dunn stand up on the count
Is you involved wit it or out, while I shoutEmbed
