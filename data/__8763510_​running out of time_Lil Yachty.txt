Watch it, girl, don't ever tell me lies
I said "Watch it," baby, you and I been runnin' out of time
What you may never know is more than you will see
And I can part the ocean, come and see it, uh-mm
If I told you all of my secrets, baby girl
Would you look in my eyes and feel deceived?
Well, I can't let you leave, I told you far too much
Now you gotta stick with me, yeah-mm

Run out, runnin' out of time
Run out, runnin' out of time with me

Stay up with me
Stay up and watch the sun
Baby, lay up with me
Stay up with me
You been on my mind
And livin' here like it ain't much time left
Run your lips into mine
Stronger when we unite, hoo (Ooh)

Run out, runnin' out of timе
Run out, runnin'  out of time with me
You might also like
Stay up with me
Stay up and watch thе sun
Baby, lay up with me
Stay up with me
You been on my mind
And livin' here like it ain't much time left
Run your lips into mine
Stronger when we unite, hoo

Run out, runnin' out of time
Run out, runnin' out of time with me
Run out, runnin' out of time
Run out, runnin' out of time with me7Embed
