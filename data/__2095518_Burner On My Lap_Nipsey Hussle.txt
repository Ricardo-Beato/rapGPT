5 ContributorsBurner On My Lap Lyrics
â€”My hood
DJ Skee, Westside exclusive
Yeah
Slauson boy
Ayy, check me out, look

I got my burner on my lap, homies in the back
I'm smokin' weed 'til my lips turn black
Now we pressin' through your turf and finna put in work, huh
We squeeze triggers 'til the triggers don't work
Click, extra clip for the Johnny, just in case they give a homie, homicide never for me
You get chip, yeah, nigga, that's a promise, if we can't get you today the homies get you tomorrow (What up, Nipsey?)
]
Homies in the hood keep dealin'
Did you hit a lick? Did you pass? What you sellin'?
Who you finna chip, we go to math, let's go get it
Next thing, I know they said the homies was snitchin', but goddamn
Mama said, "Never let your right hand see your left hands playin'
Your right hand might be workin' good to white men"
Damn, make a nigga think it's kind of hard for me to think, but, uh
I done seen niggas, that's what the bitch switch up
Killers on the streets catchin' cases, turn snitches (Damn)
So really as it is, homie, I'm my own nigga
I don't fuck with you niggas
Man, fuck y'all niggas
I got burners on my lap, I bust y'all niggas
And smash off in the lack with the North store in it (Yeah)
Yeah, nigga, it's fuck y'all niggas
I got burners on my lap and I bust y'all niggas
You might also like
I got my burner on my lap, homies in the back
I'm smokin' weed 'til my lips turn black
Now we pressin' through your turf and finna put in work, huh
We squeeze triggers 'til the triggers don't work
Click, extra clip for the Johnny, just in case they give a homie, homicide never for me
You get chip, yeah, nigga, that's a promise, if we can't get you today the homies get you tomorrow (Ayy, look)

Niggas talkin' 'bout they block, 
And I was right here with white squares like dominos, huh
I run the spot like Nina at the quarter
C.R.A.S.H. cops think they smart, we know that we smarter (Huh)
I bust up from a regal to a robber
Then I'm one about a ten, couple pounds 'cross the water
And when I came back, this bitch says she have my daughter
Had to smack the punk-ho just for crackin' out of order (Huh)
Niggas can't hold water, so my gun hold sloth
And when they mouth get to lickin', I don't show no love
I don't talk to police, I don't talk to the judge
And be them loud-mouth-niggas, I was talkin' 'bout 
I seen it all in the Crenshaw district
Niggas stuck at they line and 63rd got twisted
Niggas that couldn't fight, that thunder domes got issues
Beat up and proofed, homie, in back of the school, homie (Yeah)Embed
