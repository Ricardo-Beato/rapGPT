Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah

I ball on these hoes and I flex, did it on my own
I'm in the cut with a Tec, this ain't what he want
She just want the diamonds on my neck, she gon' catch a cold
I just fell in love with her neck, I can't let her go
I can't let her go
'Member when I met her in the trap, she was scrapin' bowls
Whippin' work, runnin' from the cops, she was hittin' curbs
In the car, singin' all my songs, she knew all the words

Then I lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her, just lost her
Yeah, I just lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her, just lost her
Yeah, I just lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her

Give me head in my joggers (Yah)
You thought these were Nikes? Sorry, these Balenciagas (Yah)
They thought I was the devil because I had all the Prada (Yah)
Keep the heavy metal in my skin, these like a rocker
999, fuck 'em all, that's the motto (Hey)
If he run up, I will fill him up with hollows (Ayy)
I sip Hennessy, won't catch me poppin' bottles (Ayy)
Up in VIP seducin' all the models, ayy

Don't blink, put the Raf Simons on to complement the Mink
There's a room full of hoes gettin' wet for me
But they only wanna fuck me for my Louis V (Yeah, ayy)
Told her don't blink, got the Raf Simon pants complement the Mink
There's a room full of hoes gettin' wet for me
But they only wanna fuck me for my Louis V
So I lost her

W-woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her, just lost her
Yeah, I just lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her, just lost her
I just lost her
Fucked her for the minute even though I didn't want her
I grew up with them niggas that was servin' on the corner
I was on my trap phone takin' all the orders
When I lost her (When I lost her)
Wo-woah, I just lost her (I just lost her)
Wo-woah, I just lost her (I just lost her)

I just lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
I was lookin' in the water9Embed
