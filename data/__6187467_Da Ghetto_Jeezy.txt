11 ContributorsDa Ghetto Lyrics
Oh, you gotta know when something related to this shit
Oh, you ain't did nothin' I ain't never did, nigga
Trust me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

The ghetto
That's where I learned my lessons, where I got my blessings (Yeah)
The ghetto
Seen my first ten thousand, nigga I ain't even flexin'
The ghetto
On fire, no lighter (No lighter), hood like Al-Qaeda (Damn)
The ghetto
Got money on my mind (On my mind), that's why I pull them all-nighters
In the ghetto

Old school with the pipes on it
Pull up on the block, shoot dice on it (Damn)
And we don't give a fuck about the polices (Nah)
Got court in the morning, pray to sweet Jesus
Granny cooking neck bones, throw some rice on it (On it)
I got a fifth of brown liquor, throw some ice on it
Gotta get your checks cashed at the liquor store (Store)
And I'm playing Cash 3 at the Texaco (Haha)
Apartment so hot, gave your boy a tan
Swear I just seen the homies on Gangland (Damn)
You either on parole or probation
The DA gonna send you on vacation (Yeah)
Turn the water back on with some grip pliers
All the telephone poles got club fliers (Yeah)
Ten-year sentence, modern-day grave
Where they still treat us like modern-day slaves
You might also like
The ghetto
That's where I learned my lessons, where I got my blessings (Yeah)
The ghetto
Seen my first ten thousand, nigga I ain't even flexin'
The ghetto
On fire, no lighter (No lighter), hood like Al-Qaeda (Damn)
The ghetto
Got money on my mind (On my mind), that's why I pull them all-nighters
In the ghetto

Hot dogs, and pork and beans (Comfort food)
Hot water cornbread and mustard greens (Soul foods)
Skid marks from the tires (Skee-skrrt)
Rims spinning like dryers (Aye)
Pullin' all-nighters
We use a dope fiend match if we ain't got a lighter
Spring, fall, winter, and summer
Always remember, a fiend never forget a phone number (Uh-uh)
In the ghetto, when your lips is black, you either smoke too much cigarettes or do too much crack (Damn)
We're tryna get out, and that's a fact
Finish college, co-mack-ulations on that (Congratulations)
My daughter, she datin' a dread bro
He activated, might get our wig split in half by the po-po (Twelve)
We can be our own enemy (Yeah, haterism)
Plus we dealing with white supremacy
The ghetto
That's where I learned my lessons, where I got my blessings (Yeah)
The ghetto
Seen my first ten thousand, nigga I ain't even flexin'
The ghetto
On fire, no lighter (No lighter), hood like Al-Qaeda (Damn)
The ghetto
Got money on my mind (On my mind), that's why I pull them all-nighters
In the ghettoEmbed
