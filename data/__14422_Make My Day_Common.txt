6 ContributorsMake My Day Lyrics
Yeah the sun is shining brighter
'Cause she really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh
Yeah, I think I like her
'Cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh

Seen her on the beach, she was wrapped in a towel
Her body's so endowed, seen her ass, cracked a smile
Enjoying the Nile, taking the breeze in
On some cat and mouse and she was, just cheesing
The sun eased in our conversation
California dreamin' 'bout Californication
Said she had some drinks in the cooler and I had an invitation
If I wanted I could brew up, this is just an indication
Of how cool she was
A couple chicks came up with their groupie love
They ain't want no pictures, only to be hugged
I'm thinkin' DAMN, damn, that's really cool because
Sometimes I wanna chill
Sometimes the best things in life are not in your plans
You came to the sand and got more than a tan
Baby girl, I'm a man and we can do this my way
Take a ride on the highway and pretend like it's Friday and it is
You might also like
Yeah the sun is shining brighter
'Cause she really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh
Yeah, I think I like her
'Cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh

She was at a barbecue
Pretty painted nails, she took off her shoes
She was 'show and tell' like it was grammar school
Sipping on some ale, I'm thinking, "Man, she cool!"
Sun smiling on her hair
Hey, they playing spades and we can be a pair
She had a spread on her, I can see it from her chair
I love it when it's sunny, girl, you could be my Cher
It's, Independence Day and free is in the air
We danced and danced away, yo
Showed her how to step, it's like a tango
From her body angle, I can tell she like me
She got me a flav, girl you're sweet as Icee
Spicy talk, the sauce drip from my lips
Take tricks and let's dip, we can do something hip
Take a trip around the world in a day, play Fiona A
Let your worries blow away like it's all okay, and it is!
Yeah the sun is shining brighter
'Cause she really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh
Yeah, I think I like her
'Cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh
Yeah the sun is shining brighter
'Cause she really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh
Yeah, I think I like her
'Cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh1Embed
