35 ContributorsWay I’m Ballin’ Lyrics
I got shotguns under my staircase
Rob yo ho ass bare face
Been had this bitch on lock, I’m bout to get this bitch a cellmate
All my life I been this cold
All my nights I spend with hoes
I keep change on me now
‘Cus this shit’s startin to take a toll
I just flew 2 hoes in, oh how time flies, clip its wings
Make you spit that safe combination, out like Listerine
And even though I’m not an artist this is where I draw the line
We don’t feel none of you niggas
Y'all some fuckin porcupines
I still got residue all on my dinner plates
Real niggas in my inner circle
None of my checks come late, I ain’t having that, I give em curfews
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress
Surprise yo ass like a baby… taking his first steps
I’m too good for just any bad bitch
Smoke like I’ve been kissing dragons
That milk carton show her missing panties
That pussy felt like a hidden valley
Thank God that I’m so gifted
I wouldn’t return a single gift
But all good things must come to an end
Like this blunt burning my fingertips
Lil' Tune
You might also like
This ain’t what you want
Put that gun to yo ho head
Make her tell me what you don’t
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that’s a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!
Neil Armstrong aw! Neil Armstrong
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong!
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that’s a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!

Stripper pole on the yacht
Stripper pole in my spot
I got yo girl in my condo
Bitch I’m ballin like Rondo
Flexin ranches up in Texas
I know it’s a blessing but I don’t know what’s a recession
If we talkin mew mew’s, Jimmy Choos and Giuseppe she got it
I star 6-7, my flights I fly private
I’m a walkin hedge fund
I copped a 62 for leg room
This bitch text saying her lights off
I bought her a new crib, it’s a tax write-off

It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Foreva
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Hold it
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Step up in this kitchen
Just step back take a look at me
Listen, that Ferrari unreleased
Stop being so defensive, I’m making real decisions
That’s the reason why we winning
We flying, we finished
Rich Gang, we drop feathers to vall
Rich Gang ball 'till you fall
We hit the block dippin cuz the block hot
Record sales, ship it from the Hard Knox
Live it like we live it twice
Ballin with them bright lights
Bad bitches stand tall
Bad bitches want em all
Hella choppas on the surface
Mansion on the beach, nigga that’s the purpose
Blow it cuz the swag is perfect
First class flights, nigga we done murked em

It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Foreva
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Hold it
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas
Step up in this kitchen
Just step back take a look at me
Listen, that Ferrari unreleased
Stop being so defensive, I’m making real decisions
That’s the reason why we winning
We flying, we finished5Embed
