5 Contributors2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted (Nu-Mixx) Lyrics
Turn the lights out from the motherfuckin' top
I’m with 2Pac in this bitch
Yeah
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta...")
Capital R shit, they all shit
("Ain’t nothin' but a gangsta")
Las Vegas, Crooked I, Tha Row mix, bitch
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Let 'em know...nigga

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the (S-N double-O-P, Dogg), my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hoes

And it goes, I got both heaters cocked and I’m ready to ride
Whoever’s ready for beef better be ready to hide
75 shots for whoever survive
Yeah, niggas leave the scene, but never alive
I'm in a cut-up with a slut up top
I got a come-up plot, don’t come up shot
What up, Pac?
You might also like
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shit's about to go down
Me and (Snoop) about to clown
I'm losin’ my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

Yeah, we livin' lavish, y'all, gettin' cabbage is a habit, y'all
Before it's over, I'ma have it all
Have a broad in a camisole with the cameras on
Count money while I ram it, dog
And they've been hating since the minute I blew
Let my enemies witness me in a new blue Infiniti Q
Sippin' Coke mixed with Hennessy too
Whoever ain't a friend of me in this industry is finna be through
Yeah, you...

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta...")
West Coast, Tha Row mix, nigga
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

Boss playa, boss playa, get the money and floss later
We off haters, scratch 'em out like a cross fader
I'm Darth Vader, strapped like a violator
Them Southern Cal streets is wild as Al-Qaeda
Better watch it if you in and bang
Ride first class here, leave under the plane
Listen mayne, you're better off trying to spread love
Brand new West, I'm the head of
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throwaway
Floatin' in the black Benz (Biatch), tryna do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryna get up on it
My nigga (Dogg) with me, eternally the most wanted

("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta...")
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta...")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party

Yeah, D. Vegas, Crooked I, Makaveli
Without them weak ass niggas
Capital R, niggas, yeah
Row in peaceEmbed
