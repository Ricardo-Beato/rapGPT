Uh, close your eyes

So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waster of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition 'bout these women and suspicion
Got me lookin' at shit different, how a man in my position
Can't start slippin' down these slopes 'cause it's all just downhill from there
As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware
When you a youngin', you just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits, so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes, I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is

Stay high
Go for what you know
Let it in your mental
And don't ever let it go
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (Ugh)
You might also like
And I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night, wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie, can't you see I'm chillin'? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah, my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep at Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, 'cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Better start now, 'cause we comin' for you anyways

Stay high
Go for what you know (Yeah)
Let it in your mental (Macadelic)
And don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
(No) Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Ugh, I told you it won't stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her
Wrap this much make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawnin', take up
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us, and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you

You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Fuck me
I want you to fuck me (I want you to fuck me)
I want you to fuck me (Oh yeah)
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Don't stop
