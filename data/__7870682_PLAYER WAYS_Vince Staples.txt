Ayy, I keep it funky with the bitches, I got player ways
Can't fall asleep after I hit, I gotta stay awake
I bust it down, she want the rounds, I gotta take a break
My conscience blinded, I be tryna fuck the pain away
I have no time to wine and dine, I gotta run the streets
Every woman I done fucked with been in love with me
She don't want nothin' but a little company
Until the sun is up, and that's enough for me

I knew that you would never be mine
I knew that you was just one call away from pressin' decline
I knew that time was of the еssence, no one еver rewinds
You know the press is full of lies, so why you pressin' your line?
I know it eat you up inside to have to tell me the truth
Ain't no way you think I think she love me better than you
I think that nigga you be talkin' to be doin' too much
You wipe your tears in front the mirror, now you thinkin' 'bout us
Please don't worry 'bout it baby girl, I'm not in a rush
He won't ever get too crazy, girl, that boy know what's up
You know who to trust, I'ma be dead long as I'm breathin'
And if I die I keep you smilin' from the sky

Ayy, I keep it funky with the bitches, I got player ways
Can't fall asleep after I hit, I gotta stay awake
I bust it down, she want the rounds, I gotta take a break
My conscience blinded, I be tryna fuck the pain away
I have no time to wind it down, I gotta run the streets
Every woman I done fucked with been in love with me
She don't want nothin' but a little company
Until the Sun is up, and that's enough for me
You might also like
I don't know that girl and if I do, it's not like that
And if I did, it was a while ago, before you took me back
You always focused on the past when I be all about that ass
When I be all up in them guts, you know you love to throw it back
You know I live for you, and me, I know sometimes it's hard to see
I know I complicated things, I know you scared to say the least
But c'est la vie, estaré aquí, namaste, not me
These hoes don't mean a thing

Ayy, I keep it funky with the bitches, I got player ways
Can't fall asleep after I hit, I gotta stay awake
I bust it down, she want the rounds, I gotta take a break
My conscience blinded, I be tryna fuck the pain away
I have no time to wind it down, I gotta run the streets
Every woman I done fucked with been in love with me
She don't want nothin' but a little company
Until the Sun is up, and that's enough for me

When I was like in sixth grade, I was ditching with gangster guys and I started dressing like that. Getting my tattoos, leaving home. He wanted money, I go "I'll go and get it for you." He's all like, "How you gon' get it?" That's how I got the money. I was like, so in love with him that anything he said, I did. He started giving me letters every day, and I would be like, "Oh, he loves me, he loves me," even though I knew, you know, he was lying.2Embed
