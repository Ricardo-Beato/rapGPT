(Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang)

Ride for my dawgs, lie for my dawgs, die for my dawgs
Ride for my dawgs, lie for my dawgs, die for my dawgs
Because it's— (Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang)
Because it's— (Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang, oh)

Home for the holidays
My friend pulled me to the side like, "Did you hear about Marcus?"
Our Marcus? "Yeah, our Marcus"
"A bunch of girls say he raped them in the back of some Target"
"They say he drove 'em back there in his car"
"And then he parked it and the rest is even darker"
Wait, which Marcus? 'Cause it can't be—
"Yes, our Marcus"
"The same Marcus we collected Pokémon cards with"
The one with perfect grades that has family in New Orleans?
"Yes, that Marcus, he's got seven rape charges"

Because it's— (Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang, gang, gang)

Because it's— (Gang, gang, gang)

Home for the holidays
My friend pulled me to the side like, "Did you hear about Kevin?"
Kevin who? "Our Kevin"
What happened? "He got arrested"
"They found a bunch of messages he sent to lil' kids"
"And apparently, he met up with this ten year old and the now the kid's sayin' he got molested"
Molested by who? "By Kevin"
Nah, it's gotta be a different Kevin
"Look, I'm tellin' you it's Kevin, that we've known since we were seven"
"The one whose dad's a reverend"
"The same Kevin we spend every weekend with and call brethren"

Ride for my dawgs, lie for my dawgs, die for my dawgs
Ride for my dawgs, lie for my dawgs, die for my dawgs
Because it's— (Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang)
Because it's— (Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang, gang, gang)
(Gang, oh)
Truthfully, it's family 'til it can't be, gang 'til it ain't
Twins, but it depends, brothers until somethin' is uncovered
Dawgs until the lifting of the fog
"I always got you," turns into "Well, I never thought you"
Years of camaraderie suddenly disappear
Almost like you never were here
Unconditional love becomes very conditioned when push comes to shove
And all that talk of takin' bullets suddenly feels foolish
Pictures with him turn to ad campaigns, you gotta pull it
Feet held to the fire
We hold accountable the ones we hold dear out of morals, but mainly fear
The choice becomes clear
And years of camaraderie suddenly disappear
Almost like you never were here

Almost like you never were here3Embed
