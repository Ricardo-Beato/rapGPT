Mike WiLL—Mike WiLL

I always wanted to stunt so hard (Yeah,) I always wanted to ride that whip (Always)
I always wanted to fuck that bitch (I always,) thank you, God, I fucked that bitch (God)
I always wanted to live this life (Life,) I always wanted to wear that ice (All this ice)
I always wanted paradise, I always wanted paradise, look

Now it don't take a lot to make you rich (To make you rich)
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit (I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit)
But I feel like money is the best drug (Best drug)
Sometimes hate can be the best love

Walkin' in like I got cameras on me, niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie, got a pretty young girl, look like Janet on me (Word)
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers ‘til we crash up the whole database (Word)
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base (Yeah,) closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes (Yeah)
What you think this life just landed on me? My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes (Yeah,) every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances, back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic, even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie, I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie, making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed, so fuck is my ransom, homie?

Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag (Yeah)
Money bag, money bag, money bag
Money bag, money bag, money bag (Yeah, yeah)

I always wanted to stunt so hard (Yeah,) I always wanted to ride that whip (Always)
I always wanted to fuck that bitch (I always,) thank you, God, I fucked that bitch (God)
I always wanted to live this life (Life,) I always wanted to wear that ice (All this ice)
I always wanted paradise, I always wanted paradise (Always wanted paradise)

Finally Famous, nigga (Yeah)
I always wanted paradise3Embed
