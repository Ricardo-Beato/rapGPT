6 ContributorsStill Here Lyrics
Up early in the morning
Waken by the sound of my cell phone
Donny hathaway singing on the ringtone
Was a homie that I went to school with
Tellin me life wasn't shit to fool with
These young niggas steady dyin' over dumb shit
Fast money for your soul
Now your done with
You hear the gun click (gunshot)
Blood stains on the walls and carpet
Pain and the hardships
Of a father identifyin' his child
From a photo of the plan
With his brains blown out now
Lets rewind to where it all took place
Started off in math class early that day
Hey! Its high school
And everybodys tryin to earn a rep
And he gone gun shot a homie to death
The impossible is happenin
Children are left to make decisions
Do ya let 'em die or kill them urself?

As I look at my life..
Remembering where ive been
I may not have been here
Cuda been in the gutter
Drowning in my tears
I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeahhhh)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot..
Oooooh
But I'm still here
I'm still here
You might also like
Another homie got murdered in the dope house
Ass pocket full of money
Chillin' gettin' smoked out
Two shots hit him in his face when he blast it
Frame pictured
And its closed casket
This is so tragic
I see death on every block I turn
Its just not my turn
Live the same lifestyle
Cash money to burn
Weed blowin' steady slippin' in the darkest term
When it feels like real life
Knowin' is next
Rep to take it
Be the last left
Humble yourself
In slow-mo you see your wholse life flashin'
That second from the beginning
Back to the end and that lesson
Is nothin short of what a nigga expect
Livin' life like this
This is duly respect
And I refuse to give debt
As I look at my life..
Remembering where ive been
I may not have been here
Cuda been in the gutter
Drowning in my tears
I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeahhhh)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot..
Oooooh
But I'm still here
I'm still here

Yeah I remember
We tatted are names on our arms for fun
Writin rest in piece for the dead and gone
Thats just me
And I ain't the one to stunt
But seems like im losing somebody every other month
Thats why I walk through the hood
Tryin' talk to the hood
But some niggas is lost in the hood
And we blind to that fact
That we actin' like they wanted us to act
White man versus black
Reason why I ain't vote for Barack is cause I love him
They gonna want him hanged after that
In god we trust
What? (what?)
Money or the life of a soldier
Sent to die in the war in a fight
That never should took place
Ameri-K-K-K
Used to be a great place (great place)
Now I guess we save face (save face)
John McCain hates niggas, (hates niggas)
On Martin Lutha King day. (hahahahaha)
Go Figure
As I look at my life..
Remembering where ive been
I may not have been here
Cuda been in the gutter
Drowning in my tears
I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeahhhh)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot..
Oooooh
But I'm still here
I'm still hereEmbed
