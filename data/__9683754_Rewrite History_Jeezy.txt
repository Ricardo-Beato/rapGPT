8 ContributorsRewrite History Lyrics
Yeah
Oh, that's a lot, man
Oh, Sony's a motherfucker, bro
Yeah
I like the way that sound right there
Yeah
Okay, I'm goin' in now
Uh

A bust down Rollie ain't shit to me
Still celebratin' my victory
Ain't lettin' none of these pussy niggas get to me
You niggas can't rewrite history
I don't know what you heard, but I won, nigga (Won, nigga)
I know them niggas told you I'm the one, nigga
Only nigga done it how I done it (How I done it)
Only nigga run it how I run it (Yeah)

Here we go again (Go again)
Real nigga for the win (For the win)
Niggas outside, I'm gettin' it in
When they see me, "Real nigga, where you been?" (Ayy)
Give me twenty of 'em now, they gon' bake (Gon' bake)
Over twenty million sold, that's on shake
'Fore it popped off, cosigned Drake (Damn)
Niggas mad I ain't fall for the bait (Nah)
Menace to society, oh, lord
Seen the same thing happen to O-Dog
Talkin' crazy 'bout me , I don't know dog
Any nigga duckin' smoke don't want fog (Nah)
I done lost more jewels than they wearin' (Than they wearin')
I done toted more tools than they carryin'
I done touched more blocks than they rappin' 'bout
At the Kenmore stove with the napkin out (Yeah)

A bust down Rollie ain't shit to me
Still celebratin' my victory
Ain't lettin' none of these pussy niggas get to me
You niggas can't rewrite history
I don't know what you heard, but I won, nigga (Won, nigga)
I know them niggas told you I'm the one, nigga
Only nigga done it how I done it (How I done it)
Only nigga run it how I run it (Yeah)

They givin' niggas flowers, I ain't got mine (Nah)
Five APs, I ain't got time (Nah)
I drop ninas off, I don't drop dimes
Sippin' on yak like it's white wine
Had to plug that, I'm a businessman
Don't believe nothin' about me from the witness, man
Oh man, he done took the stand
Got him raisin' up his right hand
Do you promise tell the whole truth, so help you, God?
You mad that I'm winnin' and you's the fraud
And every day, you out here tryna spill my name
'Cause you ain't havin' motion and you want some fame
Too much time on your hands
I'ma go on on with my plans
Big checks, can't count 'em with your hands
Shit's embarrassing, come and get your mans (Haha)
A bust down Rollie ain't shit to me
Still celebratin' my victory
Ain't lettin' none of these pussy niggas get to me
You niggas can't rewrite history
I don't know what you heard, but I won, nigga (Won, nigga)
I know them niggas told you I'm the one, nigga
Only nigga done it how I done it (How I done it)
Only nigga run it how I run it (Yeah)Embed
