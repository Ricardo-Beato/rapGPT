17 ContributorsBlue in the Face Lyrics
Yo, I surf an axiom kicked in a center fold by ugly tenements
Oh distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby developments
Today summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate
Tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it
There is a brain in the thicket tap circle
Cupping the port to accord it
Teeter thorn storm plunges more
But conformers the pouring's half the entry
Plated pearly gates a chanted axis
With high gentry hinging our binging on public picket fencing Squirming in terms in conditions of un-satisfact destiny magnet
Where the Ebenezer to Cratchit ratio tragic
Lose sight pseudo mavericks clash at futility pageants
I post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion
A leader's deception connection
Wiper with a barn responds his friend
With an eye socket full of needles
And a will to die for nothing
And that's glory
Abide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats
And the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath
All aboard that awful train through shames patch
Where I'd trade my window seat
For one pane of replacement stain glass
See I bow to the the gods of opacity
I don't mind y'all looking in
It's just watching Sin City steam slips under my skin
And I'm about half way to nausea
Half way to contentment
2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment
Build a pen around Mastodon
Patriarch close to four peters
Woke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious
Let's soak my feet in lake infinity
With a timebomb strapped to dignity
Symmetries vivid image still can't mimic the victory
Comfort is a drug and I'm numb as fuck
Yet some prefer the hum and
Others tend to suck the life out of the crux like
And I'm a tug dummy, hug the hungry
Pull the lever, push the button
Drink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest
Target everyone
Mechanized idols inhabit malleable colonies
'Till the fire ant dropped the sweet leaf, grief
Your dreams a needle in a needle stack
Claiming safety pin physics
Baby tin blizzards collide
While ole iron sides, trust the rivets
I’m sick of the pick of the litter soaking the spot lit
When I know they know they owe all thanks
To the end all Aesop Rock shit, watch this
Oh, build me a home
Build me a home of brick and wood and everything good
With a front porch where I can jar fire flies by night
And smoke stog's till the day meets twilight
Build me a home
Build me a home with a green grass hill with running water
In a backyard with a sandbox and a garden of foreign flowers
Build me a home
With a basement and an attic
Where I can store remnants of the day I once slept in
Build me a home
No skull is sacred in the races
Locked in a pagan doctrine
Watching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant
Ochre and sienna war paintings stain plague community
Harking as wrapped, it's overlooking out crops
Give you one life to laugh at catalog bliss
On the least common attachment
Ten seconds of blaring silence
Pilot is flight redefine stagnant
Most emotions host an entire lesson
Congressional, less one
Stone merely for the exceptional spectacle now
Listen the pause heed tall falls the voidance of the suit dispersed
Where the straight and narrow’s a perfect circle has-beens
Fastened to the flip side via migrating clusters
That's better than colony
My own father's son is the holy ghost, suck that theology
High king for a day or peasant for a pleasant life
Blood on the easel and my eagle eyelid spots runaway pirates
Look, I despise squatters with a, oh, cry me a river
A quarter how'd you afford that dog and sour dialogue
I put my hook in the pond
I put my worm in the hook
I put my trust in the worm
That he'd bring me something to cook
I felt a tug on my line and I lugged a trash can
On my pole with a note from the worm attached that
Read, "Thanks for nothing asshole!"
Simple parables of nature making character giddy
And riddle me a similar situation mid city
Quick, put your honor on the line
Doors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda serpents and
Report on powers of devil treatment church links
I'm a fence sitter
Lips torn by both polars and their working
I can only model throttle at the dream catching
Matching a patchy holist with a sovereignty
Harbored and charged by hate breed anonymity spigot
Spitting stitches to fix the bridges and the gaps
One night I broke in
Bridges give us traps and
Tried to walk to get stogs just like hop scotch between polar caps
And I'm, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath
Making that classic mockery of every step
Oh, build me a home
Build me a home, please, with a light in the window
And a red front door and a picket fence
And a fire place and a sturdy frame
And we can sit and I'll tell you my name, build me home...You might also likeEmbed
