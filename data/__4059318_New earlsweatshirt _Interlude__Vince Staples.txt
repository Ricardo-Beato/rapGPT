77 ContributorsNew earlsweatshirt (Interlude) Lyrics
N-n-new Earl Sweatshirt on Big Boy's neighborhood

By my mama crib, it's a lotta Crips (Crips)
I reported nothing, nigga, that's just how it is
You be on that tough shit, it ain't caught up with you yet
16 with that bald fade, Sean John on my chest (Chest)
16 with that bald fade, nigga
I said bye to Vince, went and lost fades on a island
Rest in peace to my pops and the boy Ryland (Rest in peace)
Gotta speak for the dead homies when they time endYou might also like14Embed
