38 ContributorsThe Triboro Lyrics
Phenomenon O.C
Big L, 139, baby
Diggin' In The Crates
Yeah, yeah, this is Joe the God, Terror Squad reppin'

Yo, yo, yo
I'm from a place where them niggas don't talk no shit
Where them wigs get split, where the guns forever click
Where the track stars come to warm up for a race
Blue and whites ride by and niggas yell, "Fuck them Jakes!"
So much respect, I can lay dough on the floor
Walk away and come back without cats runnin' off
I'm a model ho's wet dream, in her sleep
Performin' X-rated fuck scenes, me goin' deep
O.C. the Starchild, let your cameras record
I'm like a man bein' honored at the Grammy awards
I pitch lines like fastballs, mush-out, rap my ass off
Knuckle gaze crumblin' your glass jaw
Supreme figure, drink liquor, what team thicker?
The Big Picture be the motherfuckin' theme, nigga!
Flamboyant forever, this is how it goes
Pray we don't clap your way when the gats explode

Where Brooklyn at?!
Yo! B-K don't play!
Harlem World!
Where niggas get the money all day!
Boogie Down Bronx specialize in gunplay!
Triboro! So thorough! Always!
Where Brooklyn at?!
Yo! B-K don't play!
Harlem World!
Where niggas get the money all day!
Boogie Down Bronx specialize in gunplay!
Triboro! So thorough! Always!
You might also like
Where I'm from, dudes get sliced 'cause crews is trife
And you might lose your life for your jewels and ice
I'ma slide to the telly and abuse your wife
If I got one rubber, I'ma use it twice
I give young fools advice about the rules of heist
When I rock 'gators, hoes be like, "Them shoes is nice"
Dimes I'm willin' to hit, I stay drillin a chick
They all know I ain't shit, but they still on my dick
And I never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
'Cause all my jewels be Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
I blast the TEC at your dome and leave you restin' alone
Go home and puff a fat bag of sess 'til I'm gone
You got this nigga frontin' like he the main event
When his album ain't even last long, it came and went
I'm like Gotti to him, I throw the shotty to him
Niggas don't want it with L, they like, "Anybody but him!"

Where Brooklyn at?!
Yo! B-K don't play!
Harlem World!
Where niggas get the money all day!
Boogie Down Bronx specialize in gunplay!
Triboro! So thorough! Always!

Hoodied down with the MAC
Boogie Down where it's at
Fuck around, hear the sound of the gats
Wanna clown? We react
Fuck that! Do you know what you do when you fool with Joey Crack?
I'm coke on the streets, I'm open for beef
I'm hopin' you reach so we can go with the heat
I'm like a nigga that you just can't kill
Niggas spittin' that hot shit, but just ain't real
Uhh! It's like you muh'fuckers frontin' for me
Nuthin' to see, when I'm the one you wantin to be
Lovin' the stee', come through plush in the V
Got niggas mad 'cause they payin' while we fuckin' for free
Make Trizz a household, live what I told
I only speak that true shit that I know
Besides y'all don't want it with us
A hundred and plus killers that be lovin' to bust
What the fuck?!

Where Brooklyn at?!
Yo! B-K don't play!
Harlem World!
Where niggas get the money all day!
Boogie Down Bronx specialize in gunplay!
Triboro! So thorough! Always!

Yo, Remi so crazy, rhymes be blazin'
Styles just switch like hips on gay men
Trips to the Caymans, rich and famous
Rhymes so hot, my spit be flamin'
Benz be rimmed up, doo be pinned up
Bitch talk slick, whole crew get hemmed up
My shit drastic, all type of tactics
Rip shit, flip shit, spit shit backwards
Screw you, don't let the pretty face fool you
I kick shit like kung-fu, and I jam like guns do
You got one? I want two
Like water, I run through
Psycho, make you wanna change your whole mic flow
Floss it, givin' bitches lyrical abortions
Stay cautioned, my first shit was just a lil portion
I come back with more shit, playback some raw shit
You can't rock, so I'mma take your spot, make you forfeit

Where Brooklyn at?!
Yo! B-K don't play!
Harlem World!
Where niggas get the money all day!
Boogie Down Bronx specialize in gunplay!
Triboro! So thorough! Always!
Where Brooklyn at?!
Yo! B-K don't play!
Harlem World!
Where niggas get the money all day!
Boogie Down Bronx specialize in gunplay!
Triboro! So thorough! Always!9Embed
