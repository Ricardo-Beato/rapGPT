Can't stop it, nigga (Ugh)
Check, mm-mm, uh-huh
Can't stop that, ch-ch (Timbaland shit, huh)
Put your hands together (Jiggaman shit, huh)
Yeah, ugh
Brooklyn, Brook-Brooklyn, huh (That's right)
Put your motherfuckin' hands together, uh-huh
This that shit
Yo, ugh
Put your motherfuckin' hands together, can't stop it
Yo, yo

Show-closer, J-to-the-A-Y-Hova
Place-shutter-down, who the fuck'll fuck around?
Game-spitter, Range-sitter, Bentley-driver, nigga
Keep a full clip, I have to empty out on niggas
Ho-bagger, no-slacker
Get this shit jumpin' ike eight blacks, four crackers—
Get your ass jumped
Cris'-sipper, six-dipper, wrist glitter, nigga
Gat-buster, ass-toucher, clit-licker
Go against Jigga? Yo ass is dense
I'm about a dollar, what the fuck is fifty cents?
Hot shit, kick a nigga, turn these mics out
My jewelry so bright you can turn these lights out
Hova's like Noah: Keep two in the truck
I'm like U-Haul: Every bitch moving, I fuck
You move, slut, I gotta put two in your butt
I'm everything: the whens, whys, whos, and what
Nigga, what!

Hell, no, you can't stop it—when it's hot, it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama, Jigga pop—Jigga pop, pop
Hell no you can't stop it (Ugh)—when it's hot, it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch (Motherfuckin' hands together)
When there's drama, Jigga pop—Jigga pop, pop

Separate myself from the lame, no you can't see me
I'm six-oh-oh, you're three hundred C-E
Give my ladies dick, my young hoes pee-pee
Hits in a row like MJ ("Hee-hee!")
Since I was waist height, late night, bustin' in the clouds
Running wild, coming home late, cussin' out my mouth
Niggas said, "Bryan, leave your cousin in the house
Every time we play the Dozen, he's bugging out"
While y'all was playing yo-yo, I was sitting on low pros
Dippin' the po-po, gettin' that dough-dough
No, no, I ain't stupid—I take loot, kid
What's in the bank? Shoot it, lose it like I ain't do it
You wanna play Jigga, nigga? What you drank, fluid?
Got a full tank, now you wanna pull rank?
I clap steel, act ill, Jigga shoot thee
Give you chest pains, leg sprains—absolutely! What!
Hell, no, you can't stop it—when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop
Hell, no, you can't stop it—when it's hot, it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama, Jigga pop—Jigga pop, pop, pop

Thirty-eight revolve like a Sun 'round the Earth
Try to play hard get you found 'round the dirt
Six shell casings found 'round your shirt
(*Crying*) In surround sound from the Hearse
Jiggaman, trigger-man, hit your man up
Six shots, hit the pole, hit the van up
Kidnap grown folks, get them grands up
Timbaland, hot shit—get them hands up

Hell, no, you can't stop it—when it's hot, it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama, Jigga pop—Jigga pop, pop
Hell, no, you can't stop it (Ugh)—when it's hot, it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch (Motherfuckin' hands together)
When there's drama Jigga pop, Jigga pop, pop (Nigga, what!)
Hell, no, you can't stop it—when it's hot it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama Jigga pop—Jigga pop, pop
Hell, no, you can't stop it—when it's hot, it's hot
My grind, keep me jumpin' out of drop to drop
My shine, lose your sight tryna watch the watch
When there's drama, Jigga pop—Jigga pop, pop, pop12Embed
