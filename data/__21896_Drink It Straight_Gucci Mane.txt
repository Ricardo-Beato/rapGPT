6 ContributorsDrink It Straight Lyrics
Tell 'em what you drinkin'
Tell, tell, t-tell 'em what you drinkin'
Tell 'em what you drinkin'
Tell, tell, t-tell 'em what you drinkin'

I drink it straight, Hennessy, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, E&J, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, got Grey Goose, I drink it straight
Patron in my cup, don't mix that up
I drink it straight, Gran Marnier I drink it straight
I drink it straight, Absolute, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, Paul Masson, I drink it straight
Hennessy in my cup, don't mix that up, just drink it straight

Club night jumpin', baby roll somethin'
Later we humpin', honey that's nothin'
Somebody girlfriend in this party
Somebody stop me, the kid done got started
Somebody gonna get drunk this evenin'
Gucci got skreet thugs, more than Cleveland
Million on my ice, did it just to make a statement
Five hundred dollar tip, left it with the waitress
Shawty say she like me, really love my bracelet
Like my liquor white, so you know I ain't racist
The other night to shine, I bought the multicolor Jacob
I don't do the push up, but I do the cook up
Chinnin' on these niggas so I think I need a pull up
Blue diamonds blind you every time I dig a booger
Gucci Mane concert, everybody on front
Shawty got a short skirt, man I gotta hit that
You might also like
I drink it straight, Hennessy, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, E&J, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, got Grey Goose, I drink it straight
Patron in my cup, don't mix that up
I drink it straight, Gran Marnier I drink it straight
I drink it straight, Absolute, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, Paul Masson, I drink it straight
Hennessy in my cup, don't mix that up, just drink it straight

Gucci Mane, Trey Songz, haters sick of me
Like the last thang I ate, they ain't shit to me
Eat filet mignon and it stick to me
Your friendly neighbor flypaper, girls stick to me
Yeah niggas get rained on, bitches get rained on
So icy boy, everybody got a chain on
What it do nigga? I can't call it
I'm Gucci Mane, Laflare, I'm addicted to ballin'
Ballin' in the club, drunker than a sailor
Double shot of juice got me standin' on the table
Comin' too late, got me snappin' on the waiter
He fuckin' up the swag, he a motherfuckin' hater
Yeah, that's the business
Kush got me drowsy, pills got me lifted
Lean got me leanin', you can say I'm lousy
Gucci Mane, Laflare, and my stones never cloudy
I drink it straight, Hennessy, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, E&J, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, got Grey Goose, I drink it straight
Patron in my cup, don't mix that up
I drink it straight, Gran Marnier I drink it straight
I drink it straight, Absolute, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, Paul Masson, I drink it straight
Hennessy in my cup, don't mix that up, just drink it straight

Twenty thousand dollar frames and they custom made
Clear diamonds on them thangs so it's hard to say
Got a girl at the blaze, snort a ounce a day
She want a Amaretto cocktail but boy get straight
Baby say she want a party, I brought a cake
Told her clean the plate, she can't feel her face
In the club, you can spot us from a mile away
Diamonds in the rain look like Alize
Diamonds in my chain look like Ocean Spray
And the stones ain't cloudy, I make it rain
I got my girl comin' in on a private plane
Soon as she touch down, I make her do it again
In the club Gucci Mane doin' doin' the dance
G5 yeah bitch, that's a hell of a plan
Yeah, suicide doors so we killin' them bitch
Used to play the cards they dealt but now I'm dealin' the bitch
Lean to the left, now lean to the right
If it's in your cup and you feelin' alright
We gon' get fucked up, yup all night
Patron in my cup, go mix that up
Lean to the left, now lean to the right
If it's in your cup and you feelin' alright
We gon' get fucked up, yup all night
Patron in my cup, go mix that up

I drink it straight, Hennessy, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, E&J, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, got Grey Goose, I drink it straight
Patron in my cup, don't mix that up
I drink it straight, Gran Marnier I drink it straight
I drink it straight, Absolute, I drink it straight
I drink it straight, Paul Masson, I drink it straight
Hennessy in my cup, don't mix that up, just drink it straightEmbed
