Play ball
Yo, what up?
Yeah, Dodger Blue baby
Hey yo, Philly
How do you kill a bird with a bat? (haha)
We ain’t trippin' on no Cardinals, no Red Sox, no A's, no Tigers
It’s all about that World Series Ring
Don't mean a thing if you ain’t got that ring
Tell em y'all

Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here (you know)
Started from the bottom now we here (we here)
Started from the bottom now the whole team here
Play ball
Started from the bottom now we herе (Dodger blue)
Started from thе bottom now the whole team here
LA Dodgers now we here (Dodger blue)
LA Dodgers now the whole team here

Some say Dodgers, others say Doodgers
Win the World Series, baby show your hooters! (play ball)
This is for y’all that think I caught the vapors
No I’ve been down since Fernando Valenzuela
It's the young hog, Yasiel Puig
Come to the plate, give the city what it need
Tryin’ to make a scene at Chavez Ravine
One big swing to bring LA the ring
Bleed Dodger Blue, Tommy Lasorda
I think I saw an old man walking on water
Hey y’all I’m on Crenshaw with Clayton Kershaw
He got the Cy Young, who wanna play ball
It got tragic, I called up Magic
And everybody know that Magic flip the cabbage
Pop Bubbly with Vin Scully It's so lovely, to win in 2013

Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here
Started from the bottom now we here (Dodger blue)
Started from the bottom now the whole team here
LA Dodgers now we here (Dodger blue)
LA Dodgers now the whole team here

T Raww's on, with a dodgers cap
All blue snap bandana, where the mirror at?
Exit of the five, now Magic put the city on the map
Pitching like Ryu, I hit it like Matt
Ball so hard went pro (went pro)
You could find me at the last king storm
You can hate it or love it, Killa leave me alone (alone)
I’ll be the king so the thrill never gone, two on, killa

Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, (heavy hitter) yeah yeah yeah LA LA
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here
Started from the bottom now we here (Dodger blue)
Started from the bottom now the whole team here
LA Dodgers now we here (Dodger blue)
LA Dodgers now the whole team here
