9 ContributorsStill On It Lyrics
Yea! Hey, I'm back motherfuckaz, This sounds like one my nigga
I ain't trying to sell 10 million copies nigga, I'm tryin' to sell a million ten times nigga

I told you motherfuckas I'd be right back
Shooting dice in the hood musta lost eight stacks
Ain't nothin to a G hop back in my Maybach
But I'm only ridin' this cuz the Chevy's in the shop
502 with the chrome in the tape
I'm so excited, you damn right I can't wait
This my birthday I got big cake
Rubik's cube, you know we keep the white squares
Catch me in the E, a mill lookin for the bucks
They paying 24 I'm on my way with the ducks
26" make it sit up like a truck
I used to give a damn, but I never gave a fuck

I said that D boy bullshit, yea I'm still on it
Got a half a brick left, do anybody want it?
They goin for ten, you can get 'em for the eight
Just holla at cha boy when you tryin get straight
I said that D boy bullshit, yea I'm still on it
Think I got a nina left, do anybody want it?
They goin for the five, you can get 'em for the fo
We keep it round here, just let a nigga know
You might also like
I'm on the block all day with them blocks all day
Straight splurge up in Lennox, shit I shop all day
Shut down Champs, did the fool in Prada
Yea its just the white T, but the shoes is Prada
I got a bag full of stones and a pocket full of bills
Call me the the X man, keep a pocket full of pills
Image this, so much ice in the watch (How much?)
You woulda thought time froze
Welcome to my life yea the first episode
Never miss a beat I got a many time codes
Still count a quarter mill with my fuckin eyes closed
One hand behind my back and a fucking blindfold

I said that D boy bullshit, yea I'm still on it
Got a half a brick left, do anybody want it?
They goin for ten, you can get 'em for the eight
Just holla at cha boy when you tryin get straight
I said that D boy bullshit, yea I'm still on it
Think I got a nina left, do anybody want it?
They goin for the five, you can get 'em for the fo
We keep it round here, just let a nigga know

I'm so hot you lil niggas ain't cool
The boy gettin new paper, like the first day of school
Stay fresh like the first day of class
Two bricks and three choppaz all in one stash
Gonna cost you fourty grand and you gotta pay cash
They blunts burn slow but that paper come fast
The garbage man you fuck niggas so trash
I'm first place you fuck niggas so last
And I'm back to the future you fuck niggas so past
I know what you thinkin, that motherfucka so fast
Chef Boy R Jeezy, I'm supposed to cook
They say he gettin money nigga this how you supposed to look
I said that D boy bullshit, yea I'm still on it
Got a half a brick left, do anybody want it?
They goin for ten, you can get 'em for the eight
Just holla at cha boy when you tryin get straight
I said that D boy bullshit, yea I'm still on it
Think I got a nina left, do anybody want it?
They goin for the five, you can get 'em for the fo
We keep it round here, just let a nigga know1Embed
