Hahaha
I guess I'ma gon... Um...
Do what y'all came here for
Yahh
Yee-ah

Rasta, dem king of the jungle
Dreadlocks swing down mi back like Rapunzel
Mi bredren sling dem pack in a bundle
We-a take ya ting, sell it back to your uncle
And we-a make it rain 'til our dances to come true
We-a make it rain 'til ya better bring a swim suit
Alone when I cyame, but I'm leaving with dem two
Gyals give me brain, give me brain like Temple
And him got game, game sharp like a pencil
And if you want fromage, we can crash like a cymbal
Look pon me window, ah mi new sports coupe
Twelve horses in the hood, sitting on horseshoes
Come from the land dat Jesus walk through
Sacrifice me life, man, I bleed for mi own crew
Dem no wanna rum-rum with me, dem no want to
Murder dem and di family dem belong to
Gangsta, dem know I run the street like the car do
You can haffi leave me or dearly depart you
Hip hop is mine now, mine—what ya gyan do?
I can jump on any nigga song and make a Part Two
Playtime for me, 'cause see, to me, they are cartoons
How come every joint be on point like a harpoon?
How come every bar stand strong like a barstool?
How come every line so raw, you gon' snort two?
Murder dem, man, I murder dem
Fuck a competition, man, I murder dem
Man, I murder dem, man, I murder dem
Fuck a competition, man, I murder dem, ha!
