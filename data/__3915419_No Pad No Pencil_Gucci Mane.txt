No pad, no pencil, just instrumental!
So Icy Entertainment, I can't explain it!

The girl drived in so I'm shotgun
But in my lap is a shotgun
I popped two pills i'm not on one
But she on three, what you know bout we?
Shawty do powder, she be skeetin'
Yellow diamonds on me so I'm just 'peatin'
Red bracelet on so my wrist just bleedin'
They know me in Ohio, I'm good in Cleveland
Don't wanna talk to you i can't hear ya
So icy g dawg I out leer ya
Man it's Gucci
I'm so fresh like a newborn baby
The flow's obnoxious the boy goes crazy
Don't make me have you push up daisies
I'm ill like I am driving Miss Daisy
Shawty wild with me and she is caucasian
I wouldn't give a damn, 'cause the girl is blazin
I am hot dawg, I'm like a candle
Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm too hot to handle
Or cold to hold, I done stole your hoe
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, you know me bro!
Foo', cuz, vicelord or plug
I wouldn't give a damn, foot in the mud
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare never been a scrub
Heart shaped diamonds, bitches in love with me
Hood in love with me, hoes in love with me
Boy so icy chain so It's two n****s with me, skeet
I just farted
Gimmie two tickets, cause it's me and Bart, bitch
Now how that sound?
I'm 28 inches, above ground
I'm 20 inches, in front of the Vette
22  on the back ya bitch
It's gucci ya dig, I don't smoke no mid
I don't smoke no red, I just hold that cig
I just shoot this n***a in his got damn shit
Make him shit out his ass, make him shit when he piss
It's Gucci!
