I'm the arsenal, I got artillery, lyrics are ammo
Rounds of rhythm, then I'ma give 'em piano
Bring a bullet-proof vest, nothin' to ricochet
Ready, aim at the brain, now what the trigger say
Tempos trifle, felt like a rifle
Massage and melodies might go right through
Simultaneously like an Uzi, nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up, when lady say don't lose me
So reload quickly, and you better hit me
While I'm lettin' this fifi get with me
You steppin' with double oh seven, better make it snappy
No time to do your hair baby, brothers are bustin' at me
Beats and bullets pass me, none on target
They want the R hit, but watch the God get
Quicker, the tongue is the trigger, 'cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em, let 'em feel the blast
Penetrate at a crazy rate, this ain't no .38
Hit 'em at point blank range, and watch 'em radiate
Runnin' out of ammunition, I'm done with 'em
You ask me how I did 'em? I let the rhythm hit 'em

Let it hit 'em
You might also like
I push a power that's punishin' , prepare to be a prisoner
The hit man is the, brother with charisma
Showing you that I have, powerful paragraphs
Followers become leaders, but without a path
Ya mentally paralyzed, crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred, then it occurred that you heard I
Reduced the friction, with crucifixion
Let loose the mix then, boost the piston
Eric, hit 'em with some of that cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back, it won't be none of that
I'm untouchable, you see me in 3D
When I let the rhythm hit another emcee
Lyrics made of lead, enters your head
Then eruption of a mass production will spread
When music is louder, full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery, when I see a crowd of
Party people, pumpin' their fist like this
Ya hide in the back, thinkin' that I might miss
But the R is accurate, plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines that I have to hit
Whatever I aim at, I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain, that time is up
You been hit with somethin' different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate, nothing's equivalent
Nothin' can harm me, why tryin' bar me?
You couldn't fuck around the Ra with an army
You'll get wrecked by the architect, so respect him
I disconnect 'em, soon as I inject 'em, with radiation
Put 'em by the basement, bust his chest open
Bash his face in, let it split him
Since he brought his main man with him
He ask me how I did 'em? I let the rhythm hit 'em
Let it hit 'em

Dance floor's dangerous, packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme, beats with deep bass
Girls with tight pants, maybe they might dance
Tonight if the R's on the mic, there's a slight chance
The crowd is crucial, MC's grounds are neutral
Now that you're here, let me introduce you
Get ready, I'm hard to read like graffiti
But steady, science I drop is real heavy
Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail, on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour, now it's a habit
Ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention: follow directions, real close
Keep out of reach of children, beware of overdose
Too many milligram, no one made an iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts that kill a man
Ideas for the ear to fear, might split him
He'll never forget 'em, he'll rest in peace with 'em
At least when he left, he'll know what hit him
The last breath of the words of death, was the rhythm

Let it hit 'em
Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know, they'll blow the hell up
If I slow up they'll catch up, hell no
Wicked as I kicked it, don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it, reversed and switched it
To perform to perfection, section for section
Rhymes keep connectin', ya guessin' what's next and
Blood pressure rises, ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin', and woke up frostbit
'Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain, hit a vein, then remain
Let it radiate, vibes will vibrate, why did you violate?
Now I'ma have to let the style break
Moans now, the tone is ingrown
After this gets thrown, gimme another microphone
Before I get that, fifi I met
Whisper "I wanna reach her intellect"
Kiss her, 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let my light reflect
Hold her, mold her, make her feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure, whenever I'm with her
And you know how I did her, me and the rhythm hit her9Embed
