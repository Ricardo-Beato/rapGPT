48 ContributorsHot 16's Lyrics
See, the difference between me and you is
You think there's no difference between me and you, shit
Baby, Hopsin is in the building (I'm raw)
We gon' have one hell of a time (Right now)

Who am I? A snobby and deadly poet
So nigga, put down the pen 'cause I prolly already wrote it
I'm the nigga that Hollywood barely noticed
For pullin' cards, it's easy as sockin' on Gary Coleman
How did you get a deal without havin' no type of talent?
The shit you write is invalid, you gettin' your mic impounded
I'm livin' in a dump, you livin' life in a palace
Dinin' with Caesar salads, man, how do you guys allow it?
Yo, you weak niggas in the limelight trippin' (Yah)
But I won't let you slide like friction (Nah)
Not tryna be your buddy in this rap shit, I like dissin' (Ha)
So you can kiss my ass and watch them white eyes glisten (C'mon)
Ya'll nigga's be regulatin' the area
Hesitatin' to, scared of some defamation of character (You know)
I got it locked, no separatin' the barriers
Medicate your hysteria, heaven's waitin' to carry ya

My hot 16's be on that ill shi (Uh-huh)
Your hot 16's still with the children (Uh-huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building (You know)
We gon' have one hell of a time (Right now)
You might also like
I'm a pro but I kick it with the beginners
That what I whip up for dinner, it's been up on my agenda
I came and left, but now I'm finna re-enter
Shiver me timbers, how the fuck can a nigga be realer?
I don't know but my flow is so cold (Mr. Oh No!)
At your door, I'm ready fo' war
When you was flossin' on me, tryna swerve in your Hummer
I was plottin' way bigger, nigga, word to your mother
My verses are butter, I emerged from the gutter
To step up inside the booth and then work, motherfuckers
I'm hungry as all of the roaches that lurk in my cupboards
You should be duckin', runnin' to send the word to the others
I'm a fuckin' nightmare and your worst hell
And I'm leavin' niggas stuck behind the bars, they don't deserve bail
You see wackness doesn't sit on my nerves well
You couldn't bust with a dick full of sperm cells

My hot 16's be on that ill shi (Uh-huh)
Your hot 16's still with the children (Uh-huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building (You know)
We gon' have one hell of a time (Right now)

You see, I'm lyrically bashin' up on your feelings
I'm bad and I don't conceal it, this dragon is known for killin'
That's the reason I'm baggin' these hoes and grillin'
My madness is so appealin' and swagger is on a billion
Aside from all of the provocative hellishness
I'm somewhat underground but got the commercial elements
According to Ruthless Records, it wasn't evident
So I'mma 9/11 the label, bitches, to hell with it
I'm that crazy nigga, you can't be iller
I'll pick your fuckin' mom up in an 18-wheeler
Yeah, I'll hit it, but if she don't wanna pay me scrilla
I'll let a Rottweiler fuck her till the rabies kill her
My hobbies are rappin' vicious, slappin' bitches
Grabbin' digits, and I occasionally laugh at midgets
I'm hardly sane and half-horrific with a dab of mischief
Never rap no shit if I haven't lived it, it's that specific
My hot 16's be on that ill shi (Uh-huh)
Your hot 16's still with the children (Uh-huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building (You know)
We gon' have one hell of a time (Right now)
