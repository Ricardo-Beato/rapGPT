120 Contributors7AM Lyrics
Now, I don't think this is the drugs talking, but I really think this shit gon' work
What you think?
Um, I don't know, it might
Man, I'm tired as fuck
But anyways, um, did you see that video on Instagram?
Man, what video?
It had me dying, but yeah
Don't think I didn't see your Chanel shoes
Man, what is you talkin' about?
Hey, hey I think it'll work
Did you fall asleep? Uzi
Of course it's gon' work
And what a lovely morning
Uzi, wake your ass up

Ayy, I told that bitch I count my cake
Bitch, get out my face
.45 on my waist
Boy, get out my way
(DP on the beat)
Goyard on my waist (Waist)
Boy, you ain't got taste
Now I'm gettin' cake (Cake)
Now your bitch gon' let me
You might also like
Like, oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch
Like, oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all on my fronts

Like oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want (Yeah)
Oh goddamn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love

Like I lost a lot of friends, but who give a fuck?
I got the money, now that's all that I want (All that I want)
She ate me for lunch (Yeah), feel like 2Pac, I'm a thug (Oh yeah)

Made a million by myself, yeah, that be my song (Yeah)
Like, yeah, I rock designer when I'm in my zone (Yeah)
Yeah, I fucked your mama, I'm on my VLONE (Ayy)
Said I'm higher than a drone (Drone), boy, you is my clone (Skrt)
Your mama a crackhead, I sold that bitch some stones (Damn)
Now these bitches want me, I feel like I'm Mike Jones (Jones)
281 330 8004 (Lil Uzi, who?)
Catch me lean spilling while I'm lane switching
Drop the top, cocaine ceiling (Uh)
Backwood, propane pilling
Say my name in it, now your chain missing (Who, Lil Uzi)
Had a lot of friends and a lot of homies
Now I'm higher, now they all salty
Tell them niggas get the fuck up off me
Now I'm higher, now they all salty

Like, oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch
Like, oh goddamn, that's the bitch that I want
Oh goddamn, diamonds all on my fronts
Like 7 AM, I was fucking your love
11 AM, you took that bitch right to brunch, ayy60Embed
