17 ContributorsLike It Like That Lyrics
We was in the back of the joint cooling out
And I saw this girl, asked her if she like it like that (Ugh)
Nod her head yes, therefore I didn't stress
Let my beat keep knocking cause we rock it like that
Bust your ass slow, as if you didn't know
Put my mic inside your brain zone, don't dis, hold this
It's the rhyme, it's the beat that vibe all together
That makes the competitors sound like this
Rarely do I care yo, I let down my hair
When the music's up loud, man, I jones real bad
Lyric overload, in club, in the boat
In Jeep in America, Tribe goin' mad
Females ride when my niggas just ride
With the songs we creating and musically relating
Sex niggas talk, black bodies in chalk
Meanwhile they boot shaking on some punk shit, faking
Wait, I can't front, stick men
Who really gon' do what they say they come to do
What they say gonna do
Back at the ranch, there's no Carte Blanche
Everybody gonna move when we say move

Do you like it?
Say yeah if you like it like that (YEAH)
Do you like it?
Hell yeah if you like it like that (HELL YEAH)
Do you like it?
Tell me if you like it like that (YEAH)
Do you like it?
Verse two if you like it like that (COME ON)
You might also like
Who could be the one, rhyming ill, having fun
Blowing up, making musical memories and things
Elevate your thoughts on the vibe that we brought
While we climbing, we shine like a Super Bowl ring
You could do it too, I mean hop like we do
Interlock like we do and make your own mark
It's deeper than the song, hope you live your life long
When you win, how you start, kid you gotta have heart
Niggas in my shit, move! Give a nigga room
Back it up, it's a grown man making on time (Making on time)
Plus you damn similar to Newport's
Smoking ain't a new sport
Smoke you since the invent of rhyme
Gotta spread love, no matter where you are
Where you at, where you went, 'cause nobody want beef
Fountain is good, just flows like a river
Just go with a nigga, kid, my stay ain't brief
Put your heart in the day, in the night, family
Enemies but yo I, really don't wet that
We was in the back of the joint cooling out
And I saw this girl asked if her if she like it like that, yo

You like it that, you like it that
You like it that, you like it that
You like it that, you like it that
You like it that
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
What up, what up, what up, what up, what up
Gotta get out of here though
Let's ride out4Embed
