29 ContributorsWhat If I Kissed You Lyrics
What if I kissed you right now?
How would we explain it?
Trying to imagine how it might sound if I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now?
Would it bring us any closer?
Take the weight off of our shoulder
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to, that open with all these emotions

If we were a secret, how long could you keep it?
Keep it to yourself, don't tell nobody else
Something away, away
Something away, with you, you
And you just be mine (Just be mine)
And you just be mine, all mine
And you'd just be mine (Just, just be mine)
And you just be mine, all mine
What if I kissed you right now

Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off of our shoulder
Tell on me
I don't mind cause if they ask me about it, I won't lie
Admit that I'm yours
I don't really care who knows it
But can we afford to be that open with all of these emotions
You might also like
If we were a secret, tell me, could you keep it?
Keep it to yourself, don't tell nobody else
Never around, something away, away
Something away, with you, you
And you just be mine (Just be mine)
And you just be mine, all mine
And you just be mine (Just, just be mine)
And you'd just be mine, all mine
What if I kissed you right now?
What if I kissed you right now

Just be mine
And you just be mine, all mine
And you just be mine
And you just be mine, oh, yeah
Just be mine
And you just be mine, all mine
And you just be mine
And you just be mine, oh, yeah

If we were a secret, tell me, could you keep it?
Keep it to yourself, don't tell nobody else
Let them all think
'Bout somewhere I've been
But I've been only with you, you, you
And you just be mine (Just be mine)
And you just be mine, all mine
And you just be mine (Just, just be mine)
And you just be mine, all mine, yeah
What if I kissed you right now8Embed
