8 ContributorsHorror Flick Lyrics
We don’t make porno’s, we make horror flicks
The way I kill a bitch, that shit a scary movie
Lil’ momma choosin’ but she on that scary shit
She wanna go, but I think that she scared of Gucci

(It's Gucci!)
We don’t make porno’s, we make horror flicks
The way I kill a bitch, that shit a scary movie (yeah)
Lil’ momma choosin’ but she on that scary shit (huh?)
She wanna go, but I think that she scared of Gucci (it's Gucci!)
We don’t make porno’s, we make horror flicks
The way I kill a bitch, that shit a scary movie (yeah)
Lil’ momma choosin’ but she on that scary shit
She wanna go, but I think that she scared of Gucci (yeah)

I talk trash like every pay
My dope jump like Shawn Kemp
Need to hire Perry mason ‘cause I just caught an M
Cook my dope fast forward, sell lean in slow motion
4 am, still goin’
8 am, still smokin’
Caught a charge and beat it
Gucci Mane, I’m undefeated
Red bottom’s on all my hoes, all my bitches are so conceited
Front flip, I’m flippin’ bricks
Backflip, you hustle backwards
Your girlfriend is unattractive
Could’ve but I didn’t smash her
Call me 4 eyes with these Gucci glasses
Trap school; better take some classes
Algebra; I didn’t pass it, but a Mil’ got there the fastest
Rush hour; I’m stuck in traffic
Kush hour; I’m passin’ gasses
Ace of spades; straight out the bottle
Gucci Mane don’t do the glasses
You might also like
(It’s Gucci!)
We don’t make porno’s, we make horror flicks
The way I kill a bitch, that shit a scary movie (yeah)
Lil’ momma choosin’ but she on that scary shit (huh?)
She wanna go, but I think that she scared of Gucci (it's Gucci!)
We don’t make porno’s, we make horror flicks
The way I kill a bitch, that shit a scary movie (yeah)
Lil’ momma choosin’ but she on that scary shit
She wanna go, but I think that she scared of Gucci (yeah)

I, I, I, I killed the parking lot, I think I’m Michael Myers. (dead)
My rims so fat but I got these lil’ skinny tires
They locked me up and put me on probation, nigga. (true)
The way I chase that white girl, they think I’m Jason, nigga
I’m all in your dreams like I’m Freddy Krueger
But I’m not Freddy baby, call me Freddy Mueller
I need to go to rehab, I’m a drug abuser
I drink so much cough syrup, they think I got the flu
Smoked so much kush, I might need an organ donor
Another set of lungs ‘cause I’m a heavy smoker
Popped so many bottles, need another liver
And I don’t plan on stopping ‘cause I’m not a quitter (it's Gucci!)

(It's Gucci!)
We don’t make porno’s, we make horror flicks
The way I kill a bitch, that shit a scary movie (yeah)
Lil’ momma choosin’ but she on that scary shit (huh?)
She wanna go, but I think that she scared of Gucci (it's Gucci!)
We don’t make porno’s, we make horror flicks
The way I kill a bitch, that shit a scary movie (yeah)
Lil’ momma choosin’ but she on that scary shit
She wanna go, but I think that she scared of Gucci (yeah)Embed
