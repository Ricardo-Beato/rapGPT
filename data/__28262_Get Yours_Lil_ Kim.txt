8 ContributorsGet Yours Lyrics
Hey
Heeeeyyyy
Ay
Ok (Ok)
Ay, ay, ay, ay

Hey throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin yours (Hey)
If the rims on his ride ain't as big as yours
We gettin money what'chu hatin on my niggas for? (Ayyy)
Hey get your mind off of mine and (Get yours!) get to gettin yours
Throw your bottles (Ay) in the sky (Ay) if you're gettin yours (Ayyy)
If that other bitch's ass ain't as big as yours (Ayyy)
We gettin money what'chu hatin (Ay) on my bitches for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and (Get yours!) get to gettin yours

Boss lady pull up in the back of the Maybach
Chaffeur behind the wheel, feet up, leaned back
Readin the newspaper, honeygirl put a hurtin on 'em
Haters like a bad act, I just close the curtain on 'em
Play all day on the Siruis, radio
Satellite TV, who do it like me?
In designer outfits, while sellin the tag
Yves Saint Laurent boots, Yves Saint Laurent bag
Keep the Pokeman in case a big bitch think I'm ass
Eatin through her stomach like a gastric, bypass
Bitch you better buy a pass and you better have the cash
When you in my town you got to see me to buy a pass
Number one rule, think B.I.G
50 grand for the girl to sit in V.I.P
The spotlight is on me, I'm the one they wanna see
They give they money to Kim like I'm H.S.B.C

Hey throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin yours (Hey)
If the rims on his ride ain't as big as yours
We gettin money what'chu hatin on my niggas for? (Ayyy)
Hey get your mind off of mine and (Get yours!) get to gettin yours
Throw your bottles (Ay) in the sky (Ay) if you're gettin yours (Ayyy)
If that other bitch's ass ain't as big as yours (Ah ayyy)
We gettin money what'chu hatin (Ay) on my bitches for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and (Get yours!)  get to gettin yours

Yeah, well it's young Dash to all those who don't know
The boy who stay hot when his jewels is so cold
Killer screwface and he cockin that fo'-fo'
Wanna ice grill? Better holla at Paul Wall
Is all that called for? Whole crew do it up
Champagne, threw it up, 'til niggas threw it up
Cruisin up, tinted up, gotta be some star
Don't know what to call it, they say it's a truck car
You been with a chump pah; like Ashton
Was the first one to "Punk" y'all
Have yo' ass holy and resemblin Spongebob
Like an old album, you happen to come for us
You guys get dust off
It's the young boss, show you what the imp us for
Family and friends be the only ones missin boy
Sayin that you rich and all, tell me what'chu bitchin for
Maybe cause I'm gettin mine
Well is you gettin yours? (Ayy)
Hey throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin yours (Hey)
If the rims on his ride ain't as big as yours
We gettin money what'chu hatin on my niggas for? (Ayyy)
Hey get your mind off of mine and (Get yours!)  get to gettin yours
Throw your bottles (Ay) in the sky (Ay) if you're gettin yours (Ayyy)
If that other bitch's ass ain't as big as yours (Ayyy)
We gettin money what'chu hatin (Ay) on my bitches for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and (Get yours!)  get to gettin yours

You don't really want it with the nigga right in front of Tip
Have you duckin on the shit, wanna let the burner spit
Get bucked bitch, give a fuck who you run and get
King of the South, Pimp Squad Clique runnin shit
Bricks in the pipeline, sold in the nighttime
Take a lifetime to find a flow that's (Bankhead nigga!) quite like mine
40 cal's and 45 Glocks, I don't like nine
Mac-9 and automatic flatten niggas lifeline
I'm already rich, use the rappin as a past time
Grand Hustle bitch and I ain't settle for the last time
Other niggas settle down cause I don't bag mine
You see me pull it, I'mma blast, I don't flash mine
You niggas livin check to check but I don't cash mine
Deposit it and let it sit cause all the cash mine
Been goin easy on you rappers I'mma mash now
Niggas throw your bottles in the air, put the glass down
Hey throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin yours (Hey)
If the rims on his ride ain't as big as yours
We gettin money what'chu hatin on my niggas for? (Ayyy)
Hey get your mind off of mine and (Get yours!)  get to gettin yours
Throw your bottles (Ay) in the sky (Ay) if you're gettin yours (Ayyy)
If that other bitch's ass ain't as big as yours (Ayyy)
We gettin money what'chu hatin (Ay) on my bitches for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and (Get yours!)  get to gettin yours

Heyyy
