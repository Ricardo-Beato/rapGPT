3 ContributorsGo Hard Lyrics
Go hard or go home 

As I get comfy on the track
Rather fuck wit raw wouldn't comfy wit the crack
Yea, never clumsy wit the pack
That's prolly why a nigga so clumsy wit the stacks
Yea, so clumsy wit them racks
Though I aim anywhere so clumsy wit the straps
Half a life sentence a half on my lap
Plus I got half of the task on my back
They ain't got nuttin but time, the fuck is that
I'd rather be in jail then broke, this shit is wack
Jizzle only word for ya dog, this shit is crack
Use to hide em up in my crib, the real is back


Peel the top off the pot jus like a lobster
Off white substance side n it ain't pasta
Damn right he know what he doin look at his posture
Man we jus happy we back nigga I got ya
What u got in ya trunk sound like an opra
Way u stay stuntin on niggas deserves an Oscar
Yo I smoke all day jus like a rosta
You might also likeAnd u know its M.O.B. live like a mobster
Tell me how them project niggas live like the doctors
Studied them projects niggas we got our doctorates
Yea the streets write a book I be the author
Think I'll call it SLP stunt like my patnas


Dear lord heavenly father please forgive me
Can't turn back on em now these niggas feel me
Never dream of lettin em down that shit'll kill me
First year the money was dirty but now it's filthy
Dear heavenly father you know the real me
The use to hide it in the attic half a mill me
The use to get it in before the deal me
Now niggas actin like I owe em tell em bill me
Back up on our grind we put the worst behind us
No direct eye contact he might blind us
Risk it all everyday of the week so don't remind us
Street niggas we be in the streets that's where ya find us
