What it do? Coming at you live, it’s your boy big Snoop Dogg
Got my nephew Soulja Boy in this mothafucker
We need you to move like pronto, like expeditiously
Matter fact. Soulja Boy holla at 'em nephew - ya dig!

Pronto, you known' how we ball
She dancin’ on my drawls, with my back against the wall
S.O.D boys, got our money sittin’ tall
While your money sittin’ small
Let me make a phone ciz-allll! ciz-alllll
I’m callin up my boyz, they’re gonna bring the noise
When we hit the dance floor
My team hardcore, all the girls do adore
Bouta do the gang rock til my feet get sizzz-ore
Sizzz-ore

Step on the scene, make the haters say dammit
Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em hottest rapper on the planet
Ya’ girl love me and I know you can’t stand it
Goth-em city doors got ya boy Batmanin’
Ya’ girl go hard like Dikembe Mutombo
Soulja number one but I ain’t talkin bout the combo
S.O.D. boss  I’m the head hon-cho
Walk inside the club, I need V.I.P pronto
You might also like
Pronto, you known' how we ball
She dancin’ on my drawls, with my back against the wall
S.O.D boys, got our money sittin’ tall
While your money sittin’ small
Let me make a phone ciz-allll! ciz-alllll
I’m callin up my boyz, they’re gonna bring the noise
When we hit the dance floor
My team hardcore, all the girls do adore
Bouta do the gang rock til my feet get sizzz-ore
Sizzz-ore

Get it in, get it out, turn it up, turn it down
Big Snoop Dogg and Soulja Boy, told ya boy in your mouth
Make it bang, make it bounce, break it up, take it out
Nigga what you talking about? Snoop Dogg walk it out
Go to work, do the jerk, do it till your head hurt
We the west, just the turf, known throughout the universe
Superman and Kyptonite all on the same mic
Send us some bad bitches like

Pronto, pronto, you known' how we ball
She dancin’ on my drawls, with my back against the wall
S.O.D boys, got our money sittin’ tall
While your money sittin’ small
Let me make a phone ciz-allll! ciz-alllll
I’m callin up my boyz, they’re gonna bring the noise
When we hit the dance floor
My team hardcore, all the girls do adore
Bouta do the gang rock til my feet get sizzz-ore
Sizzz-ore
Mic check 0 1 2 3
I don’t freestyle cuz my style ain’t free!
Lyrical criminal most have battled for national, Soulja no limit
But im not talking bout Master P
I’m in my tour bus a lot and groupies in back of me
Every photoshoot, interview, video, shoot a magazine
My flow is so sick, the number one off of iTunes
My flow, quick, can lay you quicker than the fuckin’ swine flu

Pronto, pronto, you known' how we ball
She dancin’ on my drawls, with my back against the wall
S.O.D boys, got our money sittin’ tall
While your money sittin’ small
Let me make a phone ciz-allll! ciz-alllll
I’m callin up my boyz, they’re gonna bring the noise
When we hit the dance floor
My team hardcore, all the girls do adore
Bouta do the gang rock til my feet get sizzz-ore
Sizzz-ore

All black hooded up, nigga we can get it up
Ya, you can set it up cuz we will neva let it up
And I’ll do it till you get enough, and I beat you dead and red and stuff
What it do, what it is, I see you haven’t read enough
This is the life I chose for me and this is the way I chose to be
A lot of fools is hating me but that’s just the way it’s supposed to be
Never went, against the grain, always banging 20 gang
Stand for something dawg or you gonna fall for anything but later for that
Yeah, I got my swag back, I’m with the Soulja Boy, now nigga bag, back
For them GCs and TCs we in the VIP, blowin on some Laker purple trees
Jerkin knees, workin these cute bad bitches
I think they Vietnamese, we gonna get them for their cheese
Break it down, spread it round, fire a pound
Put it in the air, right now like pronto
Pronto, pronto, you known' how we ball
She dancin’ on my drawls, with my back against the wall
S.O.D boys, got our money sittin’ tall
While your money sittin’ small
Let me make a phone ciz-allll! ciz-alllll
I’m callin up my boyz, they’re gonna bring the noise
When we hit the dance floor
My team hardcore, all the girls do adore
Bouta do the gang rock til my feet get sizzz-ore
Sizzz-ore

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are now approaching 35,000 feet
Hope you’re enjoying your ride through Wonderland
I am your flight attendant Boss Lady
Turn your bottles upside down and your blunts in an upright position
And please remain seated until the flight has come to a complete stop
Thanks for flying the friendly skies with your friendly captain Snoop D-O-double-G aka The Homey”2Embed
