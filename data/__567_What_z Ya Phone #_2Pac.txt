59 ContributorsWhat’z Ya Phone # Lyrics
What's your phone number?

Now, I could make miracles to tempos
This instrumental's writin' for the nymphos: that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you wanna fuck me?
Just ‘cause I'm paid in the worst way? True
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on – still down?
Met you standin' at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

Oh, shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number? Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme, take time to rewind these ordinary words that I say
If you open your mind, bet in a minute you'll find
It's time, let the Outlawz play
What's ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
(What's ya phone number?)
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?
(What's ya phone number?)
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
(What's ya phone number?)
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

Hell yeah... ayy, you know what I wanna do though?
