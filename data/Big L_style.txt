Mm, check it, yo

Crooked, corrupt, criminal crime boss with cream
Cocaine hustler, blowin' out the brains of busters
Be in my mansion, chillin', inhalin' the ganja smoke
Counting mad cream, weighin' tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and Rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Niggas get plugged when my Glock hollers
Skunk smoker, Philly and Owl ripper
Cristal sipper, I've been a willy for a while, nigga
'Gruff got hoes, the man with all the nachos
Expensive hot clothes, drop top Rolls
East coast, West coast, fiends overdose
'Gruff get the cream with my team and I'm ghost

This money be temptin' me, to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since fourteen, I sold morphine for more green
Kept dope in a Nautica coat under the drawstring
And watched out for cops, squad cars, and Beemers
And laundry ninas, flee the country to Argentina
Laid back in the beach, yeah, coastin' with commuters
Smokin' the buddahs on the cruise line boat to Aruba
For a while, yo; pump the vowel so I can pile dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo and ship it out whenever I say so

Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast, you know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown, Downtown; you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We ain't splittin' this cream

Yo! I'ma run hysterically, 'til they bury me
Count numerically, hills of Beverly
More grands than Cherokee; president like Eric B. and Rakim
Drug game, I'm top ten; locked in, right now is not a option
And those who creep got the Mac and the heat
They got the five-inch screens in the back of the seat
And now they got this daddy braggin'
Last year had me saggin', wasn't ready
When Heavy was back and, tossed me in the paddywagon
But ain't nobody out here stoppin' love
'Cause we was twelve years old in the Cotton Club, poppin' bub'
So all the fame without the fortune; goddamn, you wrong
Killa kid Cam-e-ron surviving in the Amazon

Yo! I leave you dazed and froze with all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded, I counted while bathing with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me, I'm back to sea, sippin' daquiris
Coke factory, fiends baggin' up crack for me, from
Cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Nautica yachts, and knots busting outta my socks
Now that Bloods play the chubby
All the ladies love me, they hate who made me hubby
Behind my back they say my baby's ugly
Each night I sleep,with freaks with Lamborghini Jeeps
Neighbours be sneaking peeks
At how my semen leaks between the sheets
Mess up my loot, I cut your collars, Juan
Cause these is modern times
And the only thing I see is dollar signs
Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast, you know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown, Downtown; you pick the scene

Is every team's dream; Big L's a cream fiend
With more green than Springsteen
You know I'm crazy quick to smack a groupie
I'm known to mack a hoochie
Do I got stacks of lucci? (Absolutely!)
Harlem kids is known for felonies and sellin' keys
Pushin 300Z's, GS3's, and puffin' trees
These G's breeze while DTs be yellin, "Freeze!"
We stash cheese and keep a pocket full of centuries
Ayo, I'm set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat cause I had sex with his wife
I stuck my tool to his brain, said "Act a fool and get slain”
Nigga, yo' bitch chose me, you know the rules to the game

Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream

Yo, my crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J and Mike Boogie
And I'ma set it like this

A-yo! Folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin' this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash, or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules! I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go berserk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, 'cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley, I'm hotter than Cali
Wicked like Harry, and fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, 'cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87, I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers — you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas gotten props to swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff!
I'm on some murder stuff! And when I talk, every verb is rough!
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a body-bag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
A-yo, my rhymes are more funky than an African cab driver!
Step to this and get sliced with ease, ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?!) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out!
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from Hell, I'm the fuck up outta here!

Ayo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews 'cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood, I'm servin' brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
'Cause I'm a no maricón, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice — I'm mad nice
A-yo, I'm quick to lick the mag' twice and cold take a fag's life
My swellin' melon got niggas jealin'
A-yo, fuck bribes! I'm takin' niggas lives like a felon
Yo! I'm bustin' chumps like a Glock 10
When I drops in, the Top 10 is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme, I just kill your show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail, dig?
Yeah, and I'm nasty, too nasty to trash me, bash me
Ay-o, that's dead, so don't ask me!
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I got a pump that's sawed-off
But when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
For dissin', you'll come up missin' like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Fletch 'cause they sections say they slaughter, son
Talk about 9s and TEC's and never shot a water gun
But Killa Kam — I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease 'cause once I release
My crew from the East, we leavin' at least 20 police deceased
It's the beast on attack, so make tracks
I break backs, I jack with def gats and black MAC's
On Lenox Ave., ain't no light looks
You fight crooks, left and right hooks
If you front, get your life took!
I'm havin' nail-sharp pains in my brain like a Hellraiser
I'm blazin' trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the 9 with nothin' but lead?
Boom-bye-bye! Dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call 'em crack-more valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze, and I'm so confused
From seein' heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up to keep my head straight

I should never rhyme 'cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
'Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones
And sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin' to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I don't need a gun for you, none of you!
'Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their motherfuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice 'cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a MAC-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm 'bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, a-yo, 8 iz enuff!

True, true! And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginnin'
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Ma$e Murda and the B.B.O. Crew

I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew, my crew!

It's Flamboyant y'all
Yeah, yeah yeah, Corleone y'all

Me and my man was cruisin through the streets and everything was flowin nice
The corner's crowded, niggas must be rollin dice
I parked the ride so my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
And I'mma gamble until he come back - why not?
Click-clack, cock the gat back, gotta be strapped
The game was mad packed, mad cats pockets was fat
They playin cee-lo, my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin less than a G yo, you know my steelo
First I was losin then I started throwin headcrack
After headcrack, got my bread back, jumped in my red Ac'
I'm waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggas startin to plot, and I'm far from my block
Finally he walked out, told him, "Hop the fuck in"
On my face he saw the grin and said, "How much did you win?"
I estimated about, 45 maybe 50 G's
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey D's
Now I'm alone, headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggas trailin so I picked up the phone
Called Bones, I said, "Yo son, I'm on the run
Need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs, bring your big gun"
I don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it
Cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked
And then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut, what?
I'm cruisin fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from, and his grimy crimey
It's about to get real hasty
Grabbed the steel, took it off safety
Cause I refuse to let these niggas waste me
I started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too, leakin with a deep gash
I ain't panicked, I was quite calm
Couldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him, shook my head then started buckin my heat
It's over now, cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think I'm dyin, I'm feelin weak out on my feet
But before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first
To one-forty-first and Bradhurst
That's where Bones live, walked in the buildin, staggerin
Lookin tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye, he knew he would die
Started to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, "Why?"
Then he offered me, all of his cheese
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out
Into the streets covered with blood, about to pass out
The hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but
Damn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out
And started blowin they started blowin back I'm goin all out
I ain't holdin back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin back
I kept shootin, one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin real bad, and couldn't stop it
But still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets
The coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them, run for they share
And all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the Jakes
But it's too late, I'm knockin on the pearly gates

It's time to make power moves and get the chedda
And buy the real nice things that makes life better
No foolish acts, moves must be clever
I'm down for whatever
I gotta blow, son, it's now or never

I walk through the ruggedest blocks with jewels flooded with rocks
Hustlin' on hot corners that be smothered with cops
I must warn — my Harlem crew roll strong
Word bond, we leave mics torn
Y'all brothers slept too long, now it's on!
L Corleone will never flop, my records are forever hot
Front on me — you better not, I keep the Beretta cocked
This goes out to my peoples Uptown
Downtown, mid-town, across town and outta town
You see me flossin' often at all the club sites
At the bars, buyin' Cristals like they Bud Lights

Dime pieces get the digits, chicken heads get the wrong number

It's time to make power moves and get the chedda

Now I'm back, and all the ladies still cheer for L

We bust caps that go through vests
We only do what we do best
And that's cripplin' you brittle men
Since you wanna play rough, then say hello to my little friend

It's time to make power moves and get the chedda

Shorties hittin' me with eye winks as I buy drinks

I stand alone, Big L Corleone got it sewn
Sellin' weight in and outta state to generate cake
The one Jakes hate, got homicide runnin' outta yellow tape

("Everybody everywhere is scratching for what they can get
Did you think anybody in this town is any different?
They don't give a damn who gets killed
Just as long as the dice keep rollin
The hoes keep hoeing and the money keeps flowin")

My name is L, and I'm from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave. there's a big park
And if you're soft, don't go through it when it gets dark
'Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
They're sneakier than alley cats
That's why I carry gats
Yo, I'm a muthafuckin' fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city, shooting shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough 50/50
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave. and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because I'm all about ends and skins
When you got those, you don't need no muthafuckin' friends
If I catch you on a late night, black, you're getting stuck, jack
My moms told me to get a job, fuck that
Ayo, picture me getting a job
Taking orders from Bob, selling corn on the cob
Yo, how the hell I'mma make ends meet
Making about 120 dollars a week
Man, I'd rather do another hit
I want clean clothes, mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo, I admit, I'm a sucker
A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossin' connivin' muthafucka
Breaking in cribs with a crowbar
I wasn't poor, I was po' - I couldn't afford the 'o-r'
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip, I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja, dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds, then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene, took his brand new ring
'Cause sticking up's an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beat-up ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him, "Give up the dough, before you get smoked
Oh you're broke? *gunshots*
Now you're dead broke"
The Big L was called crazy
A top-notch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I don't care, I'll do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck, 'cause I don't give a fuck
Some say I'm ruthless, some say I'm grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
'Cause I was livin' the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous

Yo, y'all fellas like to stress them chicks, impress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks
I sex them chicks and send 'em home
Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone, I'm rubbered up in case that shit full blown
The other night around 8 P.M
Pockets crazy slim, jumped out the grey BM
Went to the ATM, took a thou' out
Then later on, I had to wild out
In the club, knocked some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin' which chick number I could dial out?
'Cause it's L, the Harlem pimp, baby, for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady, and that's ill
Playa haters be givin' me harsh looks
But I'm tryin' to sell records like Garth Brooks
So F 'em all, when it's cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Mega-ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal, boo, I guess it's Perignon
If the na-na's too tight, I throw some jelly on
Yo, try to tax and watch the 9 mill burst
I've been off the scene over three years and cats is still thirst
To hear Big L drop an ill verse
So all you unsigned cats that wanna battle — get a deal first!
I sport the bulletproof, fitted hat
That attitude — you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon' get it at
What?! I stay strapped, I go to sleep with my steel
Makin' figures while you broke cats is keepin' it real
L is rap most livest cat
I'm gettin' stacks while you askin' people "Do you want fries with that?"

And rob every last one of you niggas

I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone — why do a stupid thing like that?
Yo, I’m not in the mood, son, so don’t push me tonight

Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done, so no, there ain't no parts open
I’m not a sweet stud, I’m a street thug
That’s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug 'til he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week, bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain’t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse

It's time to make power moves and get the cheddar
And buy the real nice things that makes life better
No foolish acts, moves must be clever
I'm down for whatever

I walk through the ruggedest blocks with jewels flooded with rocks
Hustlin' on hot corners that be smothered with cops

Yo, pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down
Check it

My weed smoke is my lye, a key of coke is a pie
When I'm lifted I'm high, with new clothes on I'm fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips, movies is flicks
Also, cribs is homes, jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy, cigarettes is bones
Ugh, a radio is a box, a razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cops
And if you got robbed, you got stuck
If you got shot, you got bucked
And if you got double-crossed, you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke, a choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note, a con is an okey-doke
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff, a bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it

Angel dust is sherm, if you got AIDS you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease then you got burned
Max mean to relax, guns and pistols is gats
Condoms is hats, critters is cracks

The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin' poems to have them faggots
Diggin' hoes like Reverend Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps 'til they head splits
Then break 'em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin' TEC's, because I be stayin' vexed
Some nigga named Dex was in the projects layin' threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin'
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they start turnin' pale
Satan said I'm learnin' well, Big L's gonna burn in Hell
Front and get scarred 'cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a heathen squad, and none of us believe in God

(McGruff:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(Big L:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own
(Big L:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

I got styles you can't copy, bitch
It's the triple six in the mix, straight from H-E-double-hockey sticks
Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute, my style switches up
They said a real man won't hit a girl
Well, I ain't real, 'cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price
I'm the type to snap in Heaven with a MAC-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed, 'cause Hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit strictly
Little kids be wakin' up cryin'
Yellin', "Mommy, Big L is comin' to get me!"
(McGruff:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(Big L:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

I keep a cutie with a soft booty
Hoes be runnin' up, "Can I get your autograph, L?"
No, bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin' hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge, just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers, bitch – if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it 'cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold-slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Ayo, crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed
So I suggest you spread, pretzelhead
'Fore I turn your white sweatsuit red

If you broke, she's shady
You got cash? She's ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death, well dressed
In Chanel, Guess, nothing less
Body got more curves than an S
I smoke her boots like Sess
And I confess the sex was the best (yes)
Within a week she had keys to my res
And then later my man Squeezer gave her gees to invest
Then one day I overheard her talking to friends
Saying how she didn't like me, all she want is the ends
Yo honey was sheisty
Had me thinking she was wifey, tricking ridiculous
Given her dues that was icey
I said it's over
And what I gave you, you can have that
It wasn't even her - it was myself I was mad at
Letting that dame use me for my name and my fame
That's lame, but it's a shame how I fell for the game

A year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, "Monique"
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right - it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that? I wore a Lifestyle

Yeah 1, 2, 1, 2. I go by the name of the Big L. Know what I'm saying?
Rock this for Rock N. Wills. Hardpack tape
A'ight. Goes like this
Ay yo. I've got the gift of gab
To lift and grab
The mic and recite hype rhymes
That'll rip and rag
And drag a fag MC
Who likes to nag a lot
And brag a lot
Talking about the lyrics that he has are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle, troop
Rhymes I hook up
MCs I cook up
Like Campbell's soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you'll get bust
And dust
And crushed
Bum rushed
And all of that
Rhymes never sound wack
Cause I've got them down packed
For you the time is over
So give me your crown Jack
I get hype fast
And MCs might last
A minute with me
Because their rhymes are light as
A feather and mine are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick
When I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MCs that tried to get with me, hops
That's why they all got taken out like a pizza box
The crown is still mine
Cause I kick ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I'm smoother than Vaseline
And I'm a stone cold rapping fiend
A lot of new jacks are coming out, but that's cool
Cause I'm the principal of the new school
A'ight. Check this out another joint like this
A'ight. Check it out
I control the microphone like a robot
My lyrics are so hot
Props: I've got a whole lot
Cause with a pen and some paper this man made
Rhymes: they're so damn great
With flavor like pancakes
I'm kicking rhymes like a game of kickball
I'm rough like a brick wall
MCs take a big fall
For trying to get with this
I'm too swift for this
A microphone murderer form of magnificence
A def rapper and also a swell one
In a battle I cook MCs well done
My hits are consecutive
I'm a lyrical executive
Bite my rhymes and I won't let you live
So to be safe on the microphone homes
Recite your own po'ms
Or get your dome blown
Or put in a boot camp
L's the new champ
I'm not the kind to go out like a Food Stamp
I'm throwing rhymes like a pitcher throws a curveball
And I'm a serve all
Punks that try to brawl
So stop sleeping on me
Don't even dose hops
Or I'm a heat you up
And eat you up
Like Stove Top
Stuffing
I'm bum rushing
Shorts: I'm taking none
My rhymes weigh a ton
I'm not faking son
You're the one whose faking, trying to be a duplicate
Can't kick stupid shit
Tell you the truth: you should quit
Rapping
Start snappin
Cause all you is a joke
Battle L and get smoked
Yo. I over throw ya
And have you screaming like a rollercoaster
Guzzle you down like a small cup of Coca Cola
I'm going though MCs like a ransack
Stand back
As I cruise
Smooth
Like an Amtrack
Your rhymes are rusty G
You can't fuck with me
That's why you're hiding in protective custody
L's not the one an'
I keep MCs runnin'
I hurt them like bunions
Make them cry like onions
I'm a lyrical fighter
And I'm brighter
Than Einstein
Try to bite my lines
And get a size nine
Foot

In your ass for being a crook
Hit with a vital hook
And get your title took
Pass it to my man

I'm the microphone murderer
And I'm known for busting mad caps

You're trying to take your idol's

I like it rough and rugged
Your style is wick wack
And played out like Nugget
Bracelets
Face this
You can't erase this
Escape this
Break this
Take this
Cook or bake this
I get so loose
On beats that I produce
Niggas be fronting crazy hard and got no juice
They're softer than paper plates
The lyrics I make is great
A few sheets of loose leaf
And an eraser mate
Is all I need to write rhymes that are extra fly
Mics I wreck and fry
Rappers I petrify
Pack a four fifth with eight shots
With one you get popped
And now your locked in a box
Dead with no props
I'm not joking. There's no time for snapping
Niggas that be yapping
I'm putting caps in
So base up and sprayed up
From the waist up
You'll be found face up
Cops can't trace up
Fingerprints. Why? Because I leave no evidence

Yo, I'm mad vexed, give me your address
And I'll deliver, stand and watch you shiver
As the bullets travel through your liver
This nigga bloodshed is mad rough
Battling me is like jumping inside a river while you're handcuffed
My fist is more nastier than Travel Fox
My silhouette inside intensive care, because I like to shadowbox
My gat makes more noise then Roman candles
I stay in murder scandles, and dust the fingerprints of burner handles
And I left Jehovah slain, I don't cry over pain
Cause I puff fat dimes of novacaine
Murder astrologist, mad cases of manslaughter
I rape this man's daughter, then put the shit on cam corder
Put it for sale on 2-5th and 8th
Her pops tried to flex and bass, then the tech correct
And spit in his face, her brother dice tried to get shiest
So I took his life, with a knife, then asked him twice about his fucking son and wife
After that, I load the gat and let the lead start flying
That shit is death defying, now you need dental records to identify him
I had beef with this Priest his name was father Clyde
This how he died, I had seven put on his side, and fulled him with formaldehyde
I get more high then frequencies, no one gets ass deep as me
Your worst nightmare, don't sleep on me

"It ain't where you're form it's where you at" - Rakim

Cause I'm like Snider, living one day at a time
Harlem's a rough route, get snuffed out in a tough bout

I scrap them like a sculpture, living out my fucking culture
My crews a bunch of vultures with the .38s and holsters
And I quick to hurt a fool, cause money got that murder pull
And don't leave my house without the guns, mask and surgicals
Don't tell me how I act and sound, I pack a mack and pound
And strap them down to clap them clowns, I never seen a cap and gown
And I'm a basketcase, I'll bash your face, and blast your waist
In a casket trace, cause me and this bastard Mase, drop at a tragic place
Cause uptown it ain't nothing sweet, it's just guns a grief
Tons of beef, and little niggas run the streets
And pop the boots for lots of loot
Even sell a cop a deuce, on top of roofs
But be careful cause the Glocks is loose
And I'ma choke you like a capsule, niggas wanna scrap? Boat

After I skin him, And spit some venenom in him
Run with introduers, looters and sharpshooters
Who spark buddah and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
Beat niggas with lead pipes, leave trails of dead mics
Cause where I'm from niggas jewels get run like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided, crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules the thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts
So front and get a tech shoved down your throatEmbed

It's either that or I'ma squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone, ice spinnin', jigged out, white linen
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad 'cause yo' career's in the ninth innin'
It's over now, nigga, leave the game
I'm from the Danger Zone where emcees get slain
Where thugs'll never hesitate to squeeze the flame
Where niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey, 48 hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT, yo bitch wrote me
First day home I dived in it
Left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
Emcees I squash and disgrace, it's all about the Benjis
So why your bills got Washington's face?
A lot of cats be frontin'
Mad singles wit' a fifty on top
L tryin' to have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac 'cuz they really were hot
Rap game, heavy hitters, it's a shame they no longer wit' us
Niggas wanna be L, ladies wanna see L

Some hoes treated me like a bum nerve when I was unheard
Now I'm icey, I ain't gotta say one word, you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggas wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit, hate to be around that shit
You don't know me, just say whatsup, gimme a pound, that's it

No respect for them faggots who enforce the law
You got something to say? Cough it out
Cause niggas be wanting beef, but when you pull out the heat

Yo, where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
'Cause mad clowns be catchin' wreck with a Tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin' to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up with you in the long run
Brothers be on the corners, actin' stupid, gettin' lifted
Their life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got talent
But they'd rather sell cracks, and bust gats
And run the streets actin' violent
To them it's all about hittin' skins and makin' some easy green
'Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a (What?) 'cause they're street struck

'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

Before the rap contract, I was sellin' crack
Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into all of that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this, I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game selling 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go head and do your thang
But with the cash profit, make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
'Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that if you're dead or behind bars?
Ayo, it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up their careers
For some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers, or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Ayo, they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams, but gave 'em up, 'cause they're street struck

I still chill with my peeps in the streets
But most of the time I'm in the crib writin' rhymes to some dope beats
Or either callin' up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin' me, like the crack be callin' Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from, you can choke from the gun smoke
Stay off the corners, that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin' on a hospital bed from bein' street struck

Hah, in the streets and in jail
Yeah, yo it's your man Big L
One-three-nine, Danger Zone
I got my man Tommy Gibbs and Corleone with me
Check it out, uhh - bust it

Aiyyo I just left the studio, and it's about two in the morn'
Just finished doin a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
And there's a good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jump in the Jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep; my voice is hoarse, barely can speak
I called back on the cell - it's Corle', mad as hell
He told me to listen well as he started to yell
"I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room at the Holiday Inn"

"It's my wife, you sure?"
You might also like
"Yeah, I'm sure
I saw the whore soon as she walked through the door"

"Say no more, which one?"

"The one in Jersey son, right over the bridge"

"We goin' hurt those hoes"

"And hurt both of them kids"

Now I'm in the Range
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change
I can't wait to touch them lames and them fuckin dames
I reach the destination
Grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin up my reputation
I saw Corleone holdin the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cut
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up
"Yo, who that in the background?"
"It's Tommy Gibbs"

"Oh, I didn't recognize you with your hat down
Son you ready? We got this whole shit mapped out
I hope you ain't scared, there's no time to back out

We gon' take the back route
And pull the gats out and throw the mask on
We ain't leavin til everyone's dead, and all the cash gone

We gon' get our laugh on when we through
But right now we got a job to do"

"So let's do it!"

I stepped to the desk clerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her listen up before she get hurt
"They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got?" She paused and said "212"
I took the steps now I'm out of breath; I gotta stop smokin
Them cigarettes gon' be the cause of my death
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the Glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pace
I felt disgraced, I shoulda shot that bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in, each had a cannon
Ready to take care what we been plannin
These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate

We know they got stacks
Cause they don't fuck with nothin but weight
We got the cuffs and the duct tape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we'll be lettin 'em loose

And then I kicked Mike in his face to watch his head jerk back
"You wanna live then tell my nigga where you stash the work at"

He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 ki's in a stash
A hundred pounds of grass, and two million in cash
I was dumb glad, the shit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the T
I put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Corle' done popped them punks

"Aiyyo fuck it L, we might as well pop these cunts"

Now that's four bodies
Two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's, split the money three ways
Now we all laughin hard, gettin nice and weeded

Ayo, 5/3-0/7-4
A little bro was born with the mind of a psycho
They first knew I was a crazy nigga
When my mother came home and found out I killed the
Baby-sitter
I did more crime in due time
Started my life of crime
About nine going out for mine
I made every little kid from my hood run
I was just like that little bastard from The Good Son
And my mind was past bummed
Dropped the blow-dryer in the water while my moms was in the
Bathtub
Then I just saluted as she electrocuted
They got booted, 'cause that's another I executed
I was a child runnin' wild like a goose chase
Punish my dad, I put poison in his toothpaste
Then I pick my aunt or sister up, gave her a quick spank
Then dropped the little bitch in a fish tank
I invited company, murdered the four guests
Put a cap in each whore chest and ate their raw flesh
I tell the truth I ain't lyin' man (When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus)
And right now I got my cousin Brian' hand in a fryin' pan (When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus)

I ain't on that hatin' stuff
I was feelin' shorty, and the bitch told me she was datin' Puff
I'm a average nigga
And she said she was in a 6-month relationship wit' that nigga called Jigga
How I'mma compete wit' that? I'm a corner nigga sellin' crack
Guess I gotta be a ball-playin' nigga to bone Da Brat
One bitch ain't even wanna fuck
She runnin' around, all open off Kurupt
The hoe I thought was gon' be real easy
Told me she got a man, and he's some beat-makin' nigga named Stevie
What's wrong wit' these hoes? I'm a fly nigga
I don't wanna go flipmode on Rah Digga
Or Miss Lopez, bitch know Feds
She used to be in The Bronx, rockin' PRO-Keds
Wit' some Dominican 'dro heads
Ridin' topless on the back of mopeds, titties all out
What! What! What!

What up, miss?
Who you hidin' wit'? Who you slidin' wit'? Who you ridin' wit'?
We can jump in the SL, rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last 'cause I sex well
If your game rusty, around your dame never trust me
'Cause soon as you blink, I'mma slide her off and bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of niggas I know are takin' care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low — I'm freaky like that
I never get caught creepin' 'cause I'm sneaky like that, uhh!
It ain't my fault your girl be ho-hoppin'
And matter of fact, the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin'
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walkin' crooked and her throat hurts
I hate to wait, 'cause I'm not on a patient tip
Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship
And when you mention my name, it ring a bell
Ask any female, nobody do it like L
I met this chick Rhonda, who pushed the black Honda
Took her to the crib and bombed her wit' this big brown anaconda

What up, miss?
Who you hidin' wit'? Who you slidin' wit'? Who you ridin' wit'?
We can jump in the SL, rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last 'cause I sex well

I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic
Ayyo, one hot summer night after ballin hard
I went to the phone booth with my callin card
And called up Joel, yeah you know L
I told her come to the crib, yo mother fuck a hotel
She said she was gonna come at ten
The bitch came, but one problem, she brought a friend
You know I'm not a rude brother yo
But I let Joel in and slammed the door on that other ho
So we was sittin in the livin room kickin it
And all I thought about was stickin it
She was mean, cause you know I wouldn't fuck wit a sleazy ho
Yo we was coolin, watching some TV show
I was crackin sex jokes, tryin to get the puss'
And this bitch was kickin scripts beatin round the bush
Talkin bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
Cause my dick, is hard enough to cut diamonds
I said, "I hope you ain't tryin to dick tease
Ayyo, cause Big L's quick to tell a bitch leave."
Ayyo my game started fuckin wit her head soon
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
I caught a cab, on 139 & Lenox
Ayyo, I took it to the neighborhood clinic
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Yo, I'mma kill that bitch, the next time that I see her

I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic
One afternoon I was cruising on the Westside
Bumpin my system, lounging back in a fresh ride
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
So I put the system on max, and bumped my shit on the corner
I saw this girl walkin by who was hype as hell
She was mad point-blank, she was right for L
But she tried to play me like a statue black
I said, "Sweeheart whats your name?"
"I got a man," "I ain't ask you that."
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
You won't be able to switch, I said, "Fuck you bitch."
Another girl walked by, I called her
"Excuse me what's your name" "Lorraine, what's yours"
Ayyo, game I kicked well
I said honey my names Lamont, but I'm known as Big L
I was looking smooth with the jewelry
She said, "L's for Lamont, but what's the Big for?" "You'll see."
Ayyo, my pockets was extra thick
"So what you doin later, oh nothing, then lets catch a flick."
Yeah, I bagged that ho well
Took her to the triple M, movies, meal, and motel
And when it comes to this I'm a professor
I didn't molest her I caressed her, undressed her then sexed her
But I must be getting bolder
Cause I didn't put a helmet on my mother fucking soldier
I started stickin up quick
And the next time I took a leak
A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick

I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it

You know what I’m sayin’? Ayyo, these bitches’ll have a nigga, give a nigga’s balls a heat rash or somethin’ man
Okay…

Ayo, I'm serious, I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black, never seen in polka dots
No other write rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze, I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics are well-writ
You sayin', "L's this," and, "L's that"—get off L' dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325is
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican, I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up, give me two thumbs up

A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate, Big L practice Gun Fu
Cause I'm a MC assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's L
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
MC's be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
With Big L you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing, cause every hero got a theme song

Matter of fact, black, I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
Wassup cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride, I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last, I pulled out fast
He tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass (boom)
I make a lot of dough, I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate, she gotta go!
When I was young I played with guns, not a kiddy toy
Cause I'm a rough, rugged gangsta, not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody wanna be like Mike, but Mike wanna be like L

A-yo, L, you must be buggin', B

Oh yeah, we gotta say what's up to the hoes, man
Word up let's go see our P.O14Embed
Yo, I be that smooth cat you never seen rollin' with clowns
One of the few from Uptown that's holdin' it down
Bitches be on me like I'm welfare
Even rich whores that live in Bel Air
Is this Big L? Yeah, hell yeah
Word up, I use a chrome gat to push domes back
Watch how you talk when you call me, Feds got my phone tapped
This rap game, I put my life in it
Chain got mega ice in it
Push an Infinite, chrome rims, light-tinted
And you can see pal, it's all about me now
Twenty G's a show, bitch, three thou' just to freestyle
I made this cheese, it didn't grow on trees
Can you hold somethin'? Sure, you can hold on these
Yo I'm fat like a old Cray-on, smooth as Rayon
L is who the ladies stay on, baby play on
I stay jewel-ed up, pockets swelled up
From banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep, in the triple black, dark-tinted o' jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn'
On the block all alone
And put a Glock to his dome
Tell him: Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'mma let this four-fifth spit, and leave your shit split
Prick, it ain't nothin' decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junky, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
And mad niggas be frontin' a lot
Poppin' mad shit, tryin' to be somethin' they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancin'
Don't even look at me, I might break your jaw just for glancin'
I'm sick like Manson
In '97 Harlem kids is blowin'

Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick, mad chicks be on a brother tip
When ya sportin' jewels and drivin' in a groovy car
All the hoes gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets — that's what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich, then them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
'Cause if you broke, you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough, you get a hoe with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone, she's gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losin' all your bucks
Soon, you broke as a joke and outta luck
Then she takes off and breaks off, your hoe's gone
"So long, dear, I'm outta here", a good relationships been torn
'Cause when you on top, everything's okay
But when you broke, you gets no play

If you don't got endz, you won't be gettin' no skinz
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots

Girls in the '90s ain't nothin' but crooks

That's why you can't talk to just any whore

They want a drug dealer, not a scholar
Some girls barely speak, but always askin' for a dollar
And if you pushin' a fresh Benz, they'll be your best friends
Yeah! As long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours
But as soon as your dough go, your hoe go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papes sellin' jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum hoes
And you was takin' 'em to the movies every weekend
Now that you're dead broke, the girls stopped speakin'
'Cause nowadays, girls want you to trick
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big...
'Cause when you on top, everything's okay
But when you broke, you gets no play

If you don't got endz, you won't be gettin' no skinz
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots
If you don't got endz, you won't be gettin' no skinz
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots
I tell it how it is 'cause I'm a bold figure
And I hate a money-hungry girl A.K.A. gold digger
It ain't even funny!
Some girls don't even know me, askin' me can they get some money?
I'm lookin' nothin' like your poppa
I wouldn't give a chick ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl asked me for a ring, and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss, but now they wanna kiss
Yo, Showbiz, I'mma break it down like this

If you don't got endz, you won't be gettin' no skinz
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots
If you don't got endz, you won't be gettin' no skinz
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots

It's like that, y'all, and that's a fact, y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack, y'all
It's Big L, y'all, I'm livin' swell, y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells, y'all
If you don't got endz, girls be frontin'
If you don't got endz, they ain't givin' up nothin'
If you don't got endz, all the girls ignore you
If you don't got endz, they act like they never saw you
If you don't got endz, if you don't got endz, if you don't got endz...18Embed
Everybody stand up
Flush is the man so let the grams cut
One shot in ya butt, my guns never tucked
Don't want a slut, finessed by the art of the cut
Like Harlem World i'm doublin' up
Feds wanna challenge us
Off balance with silencers, locked up for calenders
Made men reversed my life, started again
Gone in the wind, respect niggas rhyming ten
Stuck on the grind, with two nines hugging ya spine
Addicted to crime, new car sitting on two dimes
With two dime, New York niggas, we love shine
Whether it's yours or mine by the night yours is mine
That's shilling week anyway, fuck it, it's more shine
I'm 24, your part time you ain't killing niggas
Walking round and grilling niggas
Acting like we ain't feeling niggas
Pop bottle, roll with gorillas and breed drug dealers
North, South, East to West ya'll gonna feel us

I got the gift of gab to lift and grab
The mic and recite hype rhymes that’ll rip and rag and drag
A fag MC who likes to nag a lot and brag a lot
Talkin’ about the lyrics that he have are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle, troop
Rhymes I hook up, MC's I cook up like Campbell’s Soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you’ll get bust and dust and crushed
Bum rushed and all of that
Rhymes never sound whack ‘cause I got ‘em down pat
Your rulin’ time is over, so gimme yo' crown, jack
I get hype fast and MC's might last
A minute with me, because their rhymes are light as a feather
And mines are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick when I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MC's that tried to get wit’ me, hops
That’s why they all got tooken out like a Bensi box
The crown is still mine ‘cause I kick ill rhymes
A lotta rappers talk that murder shit and couldn’t kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I’m smoother than Vaseline
And I’m a stone cold rappin’ fiend
A lot of new jacks are comin’ out, but that’s cool
‘Cause I’m the principal of the new school
You might also like
I recite hype rhymes that shine like rainbows
I pick up the microphone and play MC's like game shows
And suckas are coppin’ pleas while I’m clockin’ G's
Try stoppin’ these lyrics, nigga, please!
'Cause my rhymes are ill like a kid with a bad cold
Your style is mad old, you’re small as a tadpole
This is a giant here, an MC rap pioneer
Before you battle me, chief, go throw on your riot gear
I’m hardcore, comin’ outta wars just barely bruised
Makin’ MC's go on strike like the daily news
But there aren’t gonna be any comebacks
Sayin’ them bum raps, your lyrics are dumb whack
I wreck shows and explode like a landmine
‘Cause L kicks the deadliest shit known to mankind
Front on me, you’ll be history like last week
‘Cause rappers be frontin’ hard and booty like ass cheeks
I’m hotter than Florida, I gets raw with a mic
Slammin’ niggas like the Ultimate Warrior
The subject, the predicate, L kicks better shit
Couldn’t get passed me if your homeboy set a pick
Try to play me out like a cub scout
Better get the fuck out my face or get placed in a casket
It’ll be a tragic incident, what a coincidence
My rhymes are infinite
Like math, and I go to work in a suit, fool
‘Cause I’m the principal of the new school
The lyrics that I’m kickin’ are like lethal weapons
Every time that I pick up a mic, I see you steppin’
‘Cause you want no parts of the L
Hear the sound of my voice, ya start bitin’ your fingernails
‘Cause you’re petro, and my lyrics are death so
Could you win a battle against me? Heck, no!
I just cruise and get smooth on the rap tip
Go ahead, bite my lyrics and get a fat lip
Or a broken jaw, you’ll get more than a beatin’, troop
Fuck around, you’ll be eatin’ soup
‘Cause I’m a brother who likes to party hard
Nice with my hands so I don’t need a bodyguard
MC's be walkin’ the streets just cold frontin’
Step to this and get beat like you stole somethin’
‘Cause I’m not the man to be stepped to
I won’t let you ruin my repu-tation
Across the whole nation
Rappers that be basin’, I’m choppin’ like Jason
I kick so much flavor, you should call me the flavor man
Here, take my autograph ‘cause you’re a major fan
Of the L, ‘cause you like the way I’m kickin’ flavor
Hot as a oven, but cool as a refrigerator
MC's be bitin’ my lyrics like a stone thief
Believe me, chief, you want no beef
So give those lyrics back to the right owner
Or get beat until ya fall in a coma
And physical contact, you don’t want that
So gimme what’s mine and there’ll be no harm, jack
‘Cause where I’m from, we don’t like that thief shit
And I’m the last rapper who you wanna beef wit’
‘Cause chumps I overrule
I’m invincible and the principal of the new school4Embed
Ayyo folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin’ this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast when my Smith-Wes’ blast
So jus’ dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don’t get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smoke ‘cause these knuckles hurt
I’m from the alley not the valley
I’m hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I’d rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don’t hang with jive pals
Adiós, ghost, I’m five thous’

Flave it’s always easy for new bait
Taken here to groove quake
Make ya more addictin’ than tube steak
‘Cause when I work a line, nobody’s jerkin’ mine
So bring the noise an’ I’ll poison like turpentine
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass rubber, your rhymes left trash gutter
I’ll leave chumps done, don’t come with some junk son
‘Cause I’m makin’ flave niggas cool for consumption
I’m more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it’s too late for that lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow up
Sour luck, niggas got popped an’ swallowed nut
You might also like
On the mic, I rip the scene right
Terra just caught wreck, so I guess I got the green light
Niggas know about Herb McGruff
I’m on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
MCs are live but I’m mad liver
Ayyo my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this an’ get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice an’ peas
(Herb can you fight?) Yo I’m nice with these
Put up your dukes, then me an’ you cook raw
‘Cause I stand tall an’ kick ass like a football
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I’m the fuck up outta here

Ayyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I’ma melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews ‘cause I'm bad news
In a mad move I'm servin’ brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this an’ get your body blown
‘Cause I'm a no maricón for poems and slidin’ hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Ayyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin’ melon got niggas gellin’
Ayyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon
Yo I’m bustin’ chumps like a Glock ten, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill ya show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail kids get nailed and read Braille when they fail
Yeah and I’m nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, ayyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that’s sawed off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
For dissin’, you’ll come up missin’, like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like flesh ‘cause they sections say they slaughter son
Talk about nines an’ tecs an’ never shot a water gun
But Killa Kam I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease ‘cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin’ at least
Twenty police deceased, it’s the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats an’ black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain’t no light looks, you fight crooks
Left an’ right hooks, if you front, get your life took
I'm havin’ nail sharp pains in my brain like a hell raiser
I'm blazin’ trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin’ but lead
Boom bye-bye then find another batty boy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call ‘em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein’ heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up to keep my head straight

I should never rhyme ‘cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
‘Cause they know when I start droppin poems
That I be knockin’ domes, poppin’ bones and sendin’ niggas hoppin’ home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin’ to see me, nigga, bring a cast an’ crutches
And niggas, I don’t need a gun for you, none of you
‘Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my number two
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn they motherfuckin’ ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, ‘cause it's a fact friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a mac ten
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm ‘bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin’ it tough
Peace to Big L, ayyo, eight is enoughEmbed
Yes, indeed!
It's the mix king Ron G!
I got somethin' the world ain't ready for!
New York City, L.A., Chicago, Atlanta
D.C., Detroit, New Orleans
Y'all know the deal! Flavor!
Hahahahahaha!
Yeah, nigga
Yeah, that's right
Baby!
That's how we do it
Follow me, tell me if you feel me!
I think niggas is tryna kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied wit' keepin' steel
See, niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
They used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin' to be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world 'til I'm gone!
Bitches be warned — word is bond, you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on! Before I leave, picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches, and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it!
Niggas don't want it! You can get it! Bet it!
Make these jealous niggas mad, I said it!
This Thug Life, nigga! We don't cater to you hoes
Fuck wit' me — have a hunnid muthafuckaz at yo' do' wit' .44's!

The bomb sparker rapper/armed robber
While y'all be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin' the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that I'm in
Hot rhymin', diamonds shinin', autograph signin'
My lifestyle is far out
Every week — bring a different car out
I go to nightclubs and buy the bar out
Uh! ‘Cause I keep C.R.E.A.M., I'm large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics, you hear all the freaks scream

Yeah, yeah, Big L, Harlem's finest, yeah
That nigga who hold it down for Uptown
Hahahaha!
That's how we do it out here on this underground real shit, nigga
It's the heat, nigga!
Now, rewind this muthafucka — you know you can't help it
Deadly combination, bwoy!51Embed
It's the number one crew in the area!

The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense, gettin' men lynched
Too intense, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
'Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs, but who the fuck cares?!
I'm grabbin' brews, takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures, and harass them bitch-ass niggas!
After you, your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex, I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A TEC-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead, they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
'Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

Now, it's the dictator whose style's greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to Heaven fuckin' with me 'cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front, troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit, so protect your fuckin' neck, nigga!
Not a role model, I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap, I got skills out the ass, nigga!
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all you new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still jel' me without a motherfuckin' LP

That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip!
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four-fifth
Ah, fool! Ah, goodbye! No need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me, death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards, I'd be missin' a whole deck
Strap up a MAC — Clack! Clack!
Motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
'Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose?
From 25 consecutive 25-to-life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One-two, everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit, I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack, I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun
The way I rock, no way you could stop
I stop, pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone, better hold ya own
'Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake, rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A! Buckin' Jay! Ill with skill
So ladies, step up — I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic, skills are bionic
Bitches are screamin' like Onyx
Respect that I peel a punk's cap back and sign it
Creep through your block, fuck a Glock, I step
Through your neighborhood, armed with nothin' but a rep
I'm givin' these ladies somethin' they can feel 'cause I'm real
Ya man get outta line, and it's kill-kill-kill-kill!

So mess around, you'll be a dead man
I get hype, Tonight's Da Night like Redman
'Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy-check yourself 'cause I ain't workin' with a full deck
I'm lethal, eatin' people
Not Jeffrey Dahmer, I'm the sequel, head or gut like Illegal
So what'cha want? Yo, I'm strapped with the gats
Step up — plap, plap! I'm leavin' caps in your back, fool
I rip shop, wanna say peace to Hip-Hop
A nigga disagree? Bring it on and get dropped!
I get wreck, I'm Party Arty so hit the deck
The kid with the TEC smokin' niggas like cigarettes
Now some ask me how I'm gettin' jewels
I tell em' big up! Big up! It's a stick up! Stick up! I stick and move!
And that's how we do!
So I.U., grab the gat and let loose

Yo, rat-tat-tat! I got the gat cocked
Nigga be ghost, play the post?
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
I'm shootin' up like the West is, fuck suggestions
I'll blow out a nigga's intestines!
Better dip past quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin' for rep, get ill in a sec
.9 mill' on your neck, blood spillin' is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny, arsony
Niggas don't want no parts of me!
Never passed up a fast buck
Ask the last duck — his jewels was truck, he got his ass stuck!
So what the fuck is you sayin', hops?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Whoever's around when I be sprayin' drops!
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas, but I ain't tryin' to hear shit!
I'll burn you faggot niggas like toast
If you die and come back, I shoot your spirit

("Fuck who that I offend
Rappers, sit back, I'm 'bout to begin")
I drive up and down Harlem blocks, iced-out watch
Knots in my socks, cops think I'm selling rocks
Pulling me over to see if I'm drunk, but I'm sober
They wouldn't fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo, you're mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kind of names, try to hurt my pride
You're just mad 'cause I'm a young cat, pockets dumb fat
Talking 'bout, "Where the gun at?" I been there and done that
I'm through with that illegal life, I'm staying legit
I love to see cars come cruising by and playing my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pistol, my whole clique's wild
I'm rich, pal, no more sticks, I'm making hits now
I drink Cristal, I'm through breaking laws
I don't sell coke anymore, I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down, them Jakes will do whatever it takes
Word up, them Federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mousetrap, I doubt that

Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick

Ayo enough's enough, Federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus, they want a nigga's soul, but they know
Big Joey Crack can never rat a cat that he know
For sure, death before dishonor, I left the streets alone
Since Tone deceased, it almost killed his mama
So I'ma keep doing what I'm doing
Pursuing my dream 'til there's enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real, I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So where's your witnesses you claim to have
Saying that I'm taking half, extorting New York and not paying tax?
I'm laying back playing the role, playing the low
But it's the same old Joe so don't get KO'd
Hey yo, I'm gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid, why don't they just let a nigga live?

Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick

Watch out for games that these females play
'Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you not aware

I know this lady by the name of Katie
If you broke, she's shady
You got cash? She's ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death, well dressed in Chanel, Guess, nothin' less
Body got more curves than a S, I smoked the boots like cess
And I confess, the sex was the best (Yes)
Within a week, she had keys to my rest
I done made her my main squeeze and gave her G's to invest
Then one day, I overheard her talkin' to friends
Sayin' how she didn't like me, all she want is the ends
Yo, honey was sheisty, had me thinkin' she was wifey
Trickin' ridiculous, givin' her jewels that was icey
I said, "It's over, and what I gave you, you can have that"
It wasn't even her — it was myself I was mad at
Lettin' that dame use me for my name and my fame
That's lame, but it's a shame how I fell for the game

Puffed a bag of hydro, then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
When asked honey her name, she replied, "Monique"
Soft and sweet, from head to feet, hotter than heat
"Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin' to eat"
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin' to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah, right! It's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night, to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in, before you know it, we was doin' our thang
I drove her home, and said, "Tomorrow, give me a ring"
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus-ass story that was off the wall
Claimin' she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that? I wore a Lifestyle
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play

Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough
I'm known for yoking jacks
And beating them with smoking gats
Leaving token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit, step to the rear son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
Cause in a street brawl, I strike men like lightning
You see what happened in my last fight friend
Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes
I leave a trail of dead mic's
Where I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided
Crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts
For selling pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a TEC stuck down your throat
I'm telling you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon
And break a motherfucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hotty stare

It's the nigga with knotty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm know to roast

Props I own the most

Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed
And got a hot lead face lift
All through high school I had braids
I kept mad blades
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak
Cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper

I'm poppin Crystal, shooting game like missiles
As projected, all ho's affected by this style
I mack like Goldie, go back like the oldies
But the goody, pulling R&B bitches wearing hoodies
They don't be knowing the way I be flowing
When I be going
I be running the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things wit a swing and have em rocking like
You say never you run, if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm
I be producing like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
For greater understanding
I'm landing blows and
Knocking sense into those that oppose me, ha
Enticin when slicing through tracks
You're screaming, "Jesus Christ," he's back
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map
So give him his dap
And me, I just take mine
Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that, fuck that
You never see me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible
Even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
So you know, beatin me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow, I'm too thorough, nigga
I make moves, cause bowels to move
When I'm creeping through your hood with a thousand little dudes
Armed with the peace like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's trying to be the best
And even in dying, couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin
Ever since L said "Throw three Gs in"
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself
I get upEmbed
Some people was born in heaven
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven, which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them... and never will

I'm only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel, it's quite ill
Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, "How will I make it?"

It seems like my life's been cursed ever since I was a child
And how will I make it? I won't, that's how
I walk around with a frown, I got no reason to smile
And how will I make it, I won't, that's how
Aiyo times was rough, I had to grow up foul
And how will I make it, I won't, that's how
I always knew that I'd end up doing time on the Isle
And how will I make it, I won't, that's how

Five years passed by, now I'm at the age of 15
No more fun and games, it's time to get cream
Cause I'm about to burst, it's like my life was cursed
I went to church, prayed everyday and it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets late, robbing suckers for funds
Now everyday I creep with the heat, ain't nothing sweet
I rob for meat, If I don't steal I don't eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living Hell
Then I started to realize, I'm better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep, now I can eat
Can't hit skins, but I wasn't hitting skins when I was in the street
Aiyo, I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'How will I make it?'


Doing time was full of stress G
All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didn't find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease, I'm back on the streets again
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic cause I'm broke, get up naked
And can't get a job cause of my jail record
Before you know it, I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for their change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either I'ma go back to jail or get murdered, but do I deserve it?
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I can't get a fair shot
I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'How will I make it?'

Word up man, it's real rough out here man
In the ghetto, all you can wish for is a better tomorrow
It ain't getting no better, it's only getting worse, word up...9Embed
Ya whole block duckin'
Every bitch that I'm fuckin' with now is cock-suckin'
It's like I'm allergic to not fuckin'
Ya niggas is faggots like Rock Hudson and Boy George
I destroy frauds with one verse
Nigga, we could knuckle up
Or we could let the guns burst
L is the type to murder your son first
To get my point across
Since y'all wanna chit or chat with the coppers
Y'all might as well join The Force
Where I'm from, believe me
Snitches get killed
Niggas be hustlin' daily
Tryna fuck more bitches than Wilt
Takin pictures in silk, gator'd up
Passport: dated up, hair braided up
I fucked ya bitch
But I ain't rape the slut, she gave it up
I runnin' with Wop, you runnin' wit' me
We runnin' together
We get drunk and blunted together
But don't front, the guns is under the leather
Ready to ill
Ready to kill, ready to peel
Steppin to Corle', you better be real
'Cause none of my niggas be lettin' me chill
My crew be deliverin' hot lead
When gats are clenched rappers I clap and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way
I be killin' up shit in rap events
It's like soon as I pick up a mic and start flowin'
The people yell
I'm rugged as hell, brothers can tell
That none of y'all niggas is fuckin' with L
When I'm that nigga ya expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time

What's up boo, how you do?
I've been watching you and you don't have a clue and this ain't nothin new
Come to the crib, I got a beautiful view
And a heart-shaped water bed made for two
Uhuh, I do my thing when it's humping time
So all you cuties that wanna bump and grind, jump in line
Let me zoom in the boom like Wreckx
When I'm through your nets
Cos I'm a fiend when it comes to sex
Am I the man? (True that)
Of course you knew that
I'd give you the world, but trick my ends, I don't do that
I'm ready to get my flirt on
One honey with the skirt on
She got knees that I would love to put some dirt on
Come here shorty, let's drink a forty and get naughty
Go get your crew, I'll go get mine and let's make it an orgy
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it (why?)
It's just room to hit it

So all my ladies are you with me, where you at?
Let me hit it from the back and tell you if it's good or wack
When I'm all alone I call honey's on the phone
And Tell 'em come see me, but if we ain't gonna bone then keep your ass home
I used to mate with this honey Kate
The sex was great
Her shape would make a sweet playa turn straight
When you mention my name it rings a bell
Ask any female, nobody does it like L
That's why the ladies wanna meet me, discreetly
Cos I'm freaky and love to go deep sea
Fishing, I be caressing em', strickly sexing em'
You know my style, I'm Down with O.P.P. like Treach and em'
I get the woman loose quicker than gin and juice
Sometimes I wanna jiggy to sporting gators and linen suits
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it? (Why?)
It's just room to hit it


Around your girl you shouldn't trust me
Cos soon as you turn your back I'mma slide her off then bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of brothers I know are taking care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low, I'm freaky like that
I even hit my mans girl cos I'm sneaky like that (huh!)
It ain't my fault your girl me ho-hoppin'
And matter fact the last time you gave her loot to go shopping
She picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walking crooked and her throat hurts
I hait to wait cos I'm not on a patient tip
Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship
I practice safe-sex so I keep the latex
Looking through the Rolodex to see who I'mma slay next
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it? (Why?)
It's just room to hit it

Yo, once again, it's the Big L, that kid who got much props
From killin' corrupt cops with motherfuckin' buck shots
So don't step to this, 'cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big, but they make coffins yo' size, too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali — it's Harlem, nigga, we do walk-by's
No one can match me, tax me, or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps, G, just ask me
'Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me bein' a virgin? That's idiotic
'Cause if Big L got the AIDS, every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than Swiss cheese
(Thugs better scat when the gat goes click-clack!)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Thugs better scat when the gat goes click-clack!)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone, chief
Or catch a buck shot to your dome piece
I must warn — I got it goin' on, word is bond
Ducks be gettin' thrown off platforms like PM Dawn
I'm catchin' bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers — not just on niggas, but hoes too
So don't try to test me, 'cause I can't stand testers
Fuck around, I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal
But man, you've been rappin' for years now
And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come outta wars barely bruised
I'm puttin' motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the get-go

Yo, ever since I was young, I ripped mics and I killed beats
And I'm known to milk freaks and hit 'em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin' snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS, then I'ma start rapin' bitches
I'm all about makin' papes, kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole
So the next day, knocked on his door
And shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin' on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style, I'm wild
Comin' straight outta Harlem, pal

Yo, on the scene is the brother that's big, I'm not a little kid
I'm a nig who don't dig a muthafuckin pig
Cause to me they ain't nothin but harassers
That misuse they badges to whip niggas' asses
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the .38s cocked, 2 deep, up to no good
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
Threw me my back and stuck a gat to my fuckin cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
But if a man woulda took the cop life, he woulda got life
And never again see the street lights, and that's trife
Around my way they shot many teens
And them cops better stop, or I'mma stop em, by any means
The Big L won't hesitate to cold diss em
And if you ask me, muthafuck the whole system
There are too many young black brothers doin life bids
Cause justice means 'just us white kids'
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
I'm about to flip, cause I'm fed up with that bullshit

I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)

Bad enough they got .38s, now them clowns gettin nine Glocks
I'm not only fed up with the cops
I'm also fed up with them punk-ass cab drivers who don't stop
They don't care if it's snowin
First they slow down, then they see your skin is brown, then they keep goin
Cause I wasn't white, the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe

Stealing runs rampant in Harlem, gambling runs rampant in Harlem—all types of evils and vices that tear apart our community run rampant in Harlem

The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin' poems to have them faggots
Diggin' hoes like Reverend Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps 'til they head splits
Then break 'em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin' TEC's, because I be stayin' vexed
Some nigga named Dex was in the projects layin' threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin'
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they start turnin' pale
Satan said I'm learnin' well, Big L's gonna burn in Hell
Front and get scarred 'cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a thieving squad, and none of us believe in God

They said a real man won't hit a girl
Well, I ain't real, 'cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price
I'm the type to snap in Heaven with a MAC-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed, 'cause Hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit strictly

I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers, bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it
A beef with me, you better prevent it 'cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented

There are too many MC's who are overrated!
You ask me, they wasn't even supposed to make it
In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is
So give it up, become a actor or a actress
Or a producer, 'cause you fail to use the
Mic right, so take flight 'fore I bruise ya
For sayin' those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract
A-yo, I'm serious! Big L ain't playin' games
I should get foul and buckwild, and start sayin' names
But deep down inside, you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin' platinum, and don't have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice, and don't even go gold
I don't like the way it's goin' down
Because it should be the other way around

I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)

MC's — what's goin on?!
I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform
One minute, you're hardcore and raw
That's what you was known for, but not no more
You changed, you rearranged, you're not the same
Your raps are plain, that explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop, now you no longer gain props
Whose fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black
Used to make phat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack
So MC's, don't ever step out your range
Remain the same, and only change with the time
Or else, you'll get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like I'm goin' for mine
But if you're rough, stay rough!
If you're dap, stay dapper!
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper!
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin' beads?

I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted
This is how it should be done!
I'm not the one, and my raps are strong like rum
But some MC's grab the mic and sound dumb, plus slum
(How come?) Rap skills — they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail, and false like fairy tales
Your technique and everythin' you speak's weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, black
Step to this and get ran over like a train track
Your raps are poor to wack, and you went on tour with that crap
Don't understand it, 'cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs, givin' MC's nightmares
Rappers be frontin' hard, and rhymes — they don't write theirs
But still call themselves MC's?
Please! How could that be?

Tight broads watchin
The Guru, the great 'Dat X, and Big L
Flamboyant for life

Check it, a year ago, I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro, then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, Monique
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get something to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dying to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right, it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it, we was doing our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claiming she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that, I wore a Lifestyle

And it's a good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jumped in the Jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep; my voice is hoarse, barely can speak
I called back on the cell - it's Corle', mad as hell
Told me to listen well as he started to yell
"I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room at the Holiday Inn"
"It's my wife, you sure?" "Yeah I'm sure
I saw the whore soon as she walked through the door"
"Say no more, which one?"
"The one in Jersey son, right over the bridge"
"We goin' hurt those hoes" "AND hurt both of them kids"
Now I'm in the Range
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change
I can't wait to buck them lames and them fuckin dames
I reach the destination
Grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin up my reputation
I saw Coleone holdin the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cut
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up
"Yo, who that in the background?" "It's Tommy Gibbs"
"Oh, I didn't recognize you with your hat down
Son you ready? We got this whole shit mapped out
I hope you ain't scared, there's no time to back out
We gon' take the backroute
Pull the gats out, throw the mask on
We ain't leavin til everyone's dead, and all the cash gone
We gon' get our laugh on when we through
But right now we got a job to do" "So let's do it!"
I stepped to the deskclerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her listen up before she get hurt
"They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got?" She paused and said "212"
I took the steps now I'm out of breath; I gotta stop smokin
Them cigarettes gon' be the cause of my death
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the Glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pace
I felt disgraced, I shoulda shot that bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in, each had a cannon
Ready to take care what we been plannin
These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate
We know they got stacks
Cause they don't fuck with nothin but weight
We got the cuffs and the duct tape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we'll be lettin 'em loose
And then I kicked Mike in his face to watch his head jerk back
"You wanna live then tell my nigga where you stash the work at"
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 keys in a stash
A hundred pounds of grass, and two million in cash
I was dumb glad, the shit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth
Then put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Corle' done popped them punks
"Aiyyo fuck it L, we might as well pop these studs"
Now that's four bodies
Two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's, split the money threeways
Now we all laughin hard, gettin nice and weeded

Yo, the spotlight is mine, it ain't his no more

And I'm straight, keep a Harlem World mind-state
I never lounge where you find Jake
Surprise niggas like a blind date, L rhyme great
And I'mma increase the crime rate for old time's sake
Run with me and I'mma make you a star
When me and my crew hit the clubs, we go straight to the bar
Leave 'em empty, I cruise through Harlem in a M3
Never pay for parties, say my name and I'm in free
I'm on some 100-G car shit, superstar shit
Sellin' niggas that wet shit right out the jar shit
I'm dumb hot, I'll wreck you and your young flock
Keep the gun cocked, represent one block

However you want it is how I'm gonna give it to you, Big L style
They brought it back to the streets ‘cause that shit sell now
So pal, back up a bit, give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World, not Melrose Place
So I'mma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop frontin' ‘cause I might get vexed
And I'mma run up on y'all and slice yours necks

So I know ya ain't think I was comin' with some fruitcake shit
Y'all know me better than that

Ayo, I shoulda been out, I'm deadly when I pull the pen out
Keep frontin', I'ma try yo' chin out
I knocked a lot of men out, I left 'em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
It's either that or I'ma squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone, ice spinnin', jigged out, white linen
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad 'cause yo' career's in the ninth innin'
It's over now, nigga, leave the game
I'm from the Danger Zone where emcees get slain
Where thugs'll never hesitate to squeeze the flame
Where niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey, 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT, yo bitch wrote me
First day home I dived in it, left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
Emcees I squash and disgrace, it's all about the Benjis
So why your bills got Washington's face?
A lot of cats be frontin', mad singles wit' a fifty on top
L tryin' to have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac 'cause they really were hot
Rap game, heavy hitters, it's a shame they no longer with us
Niggas wanna be L, ladies wanna see L
If I go to jail you'll wear a shirt sayin' "Free L!"
What?! Word up man, them niggas is hungry
They ready to bite a nigga arm off

Because they sick of all this drag queen shit
Your wife's missin', I'm the nigga she was last seen wit'
Me and Ron hit it up on some tag team shit
A bunch of niggas got smoked for the cash
Used to ride Greyhounds wit' dime hoes who stuff the coke in their ass
Crazy beef's got provoked in the past, lot of wigs got split
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World be the place of my birth, believe me son
We breed the smoothest niggas on the face of the Earth
Mics I steadily smoke, rhymes cleverly wrote
As long as I can rock a crowd I'ma never be broke
Some hoes treated me like a bum nerd when I was unheard
Now I'm icey, I ain't gotta say one word, you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggas wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit, hate to be around that shit
You don't know me, just say what's up, give me a pound, that's it
When I was at the steak house, pullin' cake out
You was at some cheap Chinese shit gettin' take out
How you make out, you took the fake route, you oughta break out
You couldn't get a bitch before you put your tape out
What?! Yeah, fuckin' punks
Niggas like you will get robbed everyday

Hit the bar spend cash like Monopoly ends
Plushed out, rock gators and exotical skins
Come in the hood, flippin the chicken and broccoli Timbs
Niggas come in the game, block they shot at the rim
That ain't in you - the fuck you gon' possibly win
I do it, "Booty Calls" on the BlackSTREET Teddy tip
Keep a steady grip, make cream just like Reddi-Wip
Heavy with, styles that's the deadliest
Cats on that petty shit watch how much lead he get
You tryin to go places, chasin Oasis
About nothin gettin low wages
Drink Hennessy with no chasers
Right hook is like Joe Frazier's, I'm the bodacious
Body parts are big and like Schwarzenegger's
Smokin' Garcia Vega tryin to get the larger paper
If you, block the cash, we lockin ass
I'ma put it in your chest like a Stockton pass
Only out to earn figures like we please
But I don't mind to burn niggas like CDs
Now - exhibit, styles I kick with it
 Pardon me, but I'm fucking sick with it

Walk away and come back without cats runnin' off
I'm a model ho's wet dream, in her sleep
Performin' X-rated fuck scenes, me goin' deep
O.C. the Starchild, let your cameras record
I'm like a man bein' honored at the Grammy awards
I pitch lines like fastballs, mush-out, rap my ass off
Knuckle gaze crumblin' your glass jaw
Supreme figure, drink liquor, what team thicker?
The Big Picture be the motherfuckin' theme, nigga!

Ay yo, hookie, is a game that a fool plays
I'm sitting here reminiscing about my school days
Ay yo I used to go mad fresh
Scoop the chick, stupid prick, get the digits and the address
Yo they was jocking, cause I was clockin fast cash
I slid a chick everyday after last class
Strictly a sex thang, let me explain
I hit 'em up, get 'em up, and put 'em on the next train
My trademark was black glasses, I cut the whack classes
Then slide off with some cutie pies with fat (hey)
Yo all the fellas was amazed
By the way I was macking females in my school days

Yes yes, y'all (here we go, here we go)

Ay yo the school I went to, a whole bunch rhymed
That's why it was battles everyday at lunch time
A brother battled me once it was plain whack
I played him so bad he left school and never came back
And in the lunchroom it was a Big L thing
I made so much noise that you couldn't hear the bell ring
One of us froze then dozed, to the top I rose
And got props when I rocked the school talent shows
My opponents got scarred fast
That's why when they see me they do the hundred yard dash
I left emcees and they whole crew phased
Yea, that's how I did it in my school days
You might also like

When I first got inside high school, I wasn't known
I roamed alone but I held my own
I was a freshman, in other words, a new jack
When you mentioned Big L, brothers was like "Who's that?!"
Then I made the master plan, now I got a batch of fans
So when you mention my name now, "Oh, that's my man"
You see how, it's all about me now
All the girls scream "Ow" whenever I freestyle
When I roll the whole crews on the scenery
So those who envy me can't do a thing to me
I used to move alone, now my crew's fat
I went from a new jack to a new mack, that's true black
I'm cutting rappers like soufflés, I came off like toupées
Yea, that's how I did it in my school days
