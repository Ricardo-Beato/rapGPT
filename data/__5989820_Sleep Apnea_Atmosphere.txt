If I could commit to you, I won't
Something tell me that I probably don't
If I could commit to you, I won't
Something tell me that I probably don't (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

I saw you from the other side of the scene
You wanted us to notice you was kind of extreme
None of my business, I kept my distance
But still I wish y'all the best of interests
The cocaine covered up the whole city
Got 'em fucking around in circles just to keep 'em so busy
Now we fighting a war for what's inside of your brain
We might even die from trying to quiet the pain
Thе price tag grew an arm and a leg
Put thе pharmaceuticals and the parmesan in the bag
You're trying to force that corpse in a box
The water's turned off, but the door still locks

If I could commit to you, I won't
Something tell me that I probably don't
If I could commit to you, I won't
Something tell me that I probably don't (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

We built this cemetery out of sandpaper
Won't ever let 'em tell me that they can't save you
You're not the only one that's wondering if you're the only one
That's not running like the chicken head got amputated
We built this whole prison out of stacked pennies
We used to go swimming in them half-empties
Southsider since the day my father first started
Dropping agriculture in the back of a Chevy
And I don't even know if I'm supposed to be alive
All I know is that I love it when I open up my eyes
And I'm surrounded by these people I would give up my life for
This is why we get high for

If I could commit to you, I won't
Something tell me that I probably don't
If I could commit to you, I won't
Something tell me that I probably don't
If I could commit to you, I won't
Something tell me that I probably don't5Embed
