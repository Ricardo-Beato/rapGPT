7 ContributorsStraight Drop Lyrics
Nard & B
Let me see you drop
Drop

Straight drop, straight drop
Straight drop, straight drop
I like it when you be on the top, straight drop
Drop that thing just like you're in the pot, straight drop
Straight drop, straight drop
Straight drop, straight drop
Baby girl you know you got that drop, straight drop
She come clean, she never come rerocked

Straight drop, whippin', whippin' water (Water)
I cook the dope way different than my father (My father)
In the kitchen cookin' like my mama (My mama)
Straight drop, tryna run on me a comma (Comma)
Remember when I only had a quarter (Damn)
Rude boy tryna watch out for the informer, former (Ooh, ooh)
But now I break down all my bales in Ferragamo ('Gamo)
Hugo Boss, jumper 'cause I just Donald Trump you (Trump you)
Michael Kors sweater with cocaine on the garmet (Skrrt-skrrt)
Woke up in mansion but I grew up in apartment ('Partment)
They used to say Sun Valley boys just like to start shit
Got eighty-five thou' on me now, right now, in hundreds, wow
You might also like
Straight drop, straight drop
Straight drop, straight drop
I like it when you be on the top, straight drop
Drop that thing just like you're in the pot, straight drop
Straight drop, straight drop
Straight drop, straight drop
Baby girl you know you got that drop, straight drop
She come clean, she never come rerocked

I like it when you be in the top (Top)
All I do is make a lot of top (Top)
Baby, drop it like you in the pot (Pot)
Baby girl, drop it just like it hot, hot
I'ma fuck you with that pussy wet or not, ho, ho, ho
Don't try run right now, I want that twat, ho, ho, ho
I'm the type to beat you all day, ho, day, ho
Gucci from the block, so I don't play, ho, play, ho
Drag a bitch to my house like a caveman (Caveman)
Be my sex slave for the day, who wanna trade, man? (Trade, man)
Ain't ashamed to say, grew up in Section 8, man (8, man)
If you ever been there like me, then say, "Amen" (Amen)

Straight drop, straight drop
Straight drop, straight drop
I like it when you be on the top, straight drop
Drop that thing just like you're in the pot, straight drop
Straight drop, straight drop
Straight drop, straight drop
Baby girl you know you got that drop, straight drop
She come clean, she never come rerockedEmbed
