So how can I be anything I wanna be
If I die in my dreams?
Uh
Heard you talkin' on my name

It's gon' be a manslaughter or homicide
If you fuckin' with me or one of mines (R.I.P. to the legend Smoke, uh)
It's gon' be a manslaughter (Biggest) or homicide (May your name live forever, baby)
If you fuckin' with me or one of mines (I felt you, yes)

(M-M-M-M-Ma)
So many problems I can kill with just a text
Not many barbers put a razor to my neck
So many fathers raised us heartless in the 'jects
So when it come to opps, murder I еxpect
Pop Smoke gunshot, focused on onе spot
White glove, dice game, Wilt Chamberlain on the block
The rain man, my stocks is one to watch
Carry a casket, a nigga carry some shots
Bomboclaat niggas in drop tops
I deserve to shine, labels turn to shrines
Still keepin' it real, every word and line
Can I freeze the watch? You niggas burnin' time
You might also like
It's gon' be a manslaughter (Biggest) or homicide (R.I.P. to the real)
If you fuckin' with me (May your name live forever, you hear me?) or one of mines (Lord)
It's gon' be a manslaughter (Huh) or homicide
If you fuckin' with me or one of mines

Four-door, hitters in the back
Big body and it's tinted black
Politickin', we ain't into that
Smokin' opps 'til the clip end
Forty carats on my wrist, yeah
Me and Dread into liftin'
Me and Dread into liftin'
Four-door, hitters in the back
Big body and it's tinted black
Politickin', we ain't into that
Smoking opps 'til the clip end
Forty carats on my wrist, yeah
Me and Dread into liftin'
Me and Dread into liftin'

It's gon' be a manslaughter or homicide
If you fuckin' with me or one of mines
It's gon' be a manslaughter or homicide
If you fuckin' with me or one of mines
To my niggas, make sure your debts is paid
To my children make sure your bed get made
And to my girl, I'm missin' you these days
I'm missin' you these days
To my niggas, make sure your debts is paid
To my children make sure your bed get made
And to my girl, I'm missin' you these days
I'm missin' you these days
Funny how the worst shit, happens to the best of them
Ooh, na, na-na, na, na-na
Crazy how the best shit happen to the rest of them
Ooh, na, na-na, na, na-na
So how can I be anything (How can I be anything?)
I wanna be (I just wanna be me)
If I die (I just wanna be free)
In my dreams? (Oh, oh, oh-woah, ooh woah)

Hey
Just wanna fly free
I just want to be me
I just want to live out all my dreams
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-woah
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah4Embed
