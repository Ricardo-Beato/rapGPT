26 ContributorsMiss Camaraderie Lyrics
It’s the sound, the hip and hip and now
When I hip you, hip you hound
Get down or get tied up and twound
Let me twist you, twist you pal…
Ya shyer, sh-shy how can I get you, get you out?
Lets have a listen in, -Rottweil(er)
Let me hit you... Hit you owww
A flight, a tryst, -night owl, when I whistle, whistle -howl
Pick up when I get Into town, tell me if you’ll

-Be around, to ride with miss camaraderie
A sight to see, a sound, what up-what iz you with Rottweil lemme get you…

Ayo hound
Be mild oh listen, lord I mean
I might've seen I swore
I saw ya looking, looking all at me
Admiring Amor-
Be idol in my heart
Oh be inspiring and more...
What kind of wizard- ?
What-what a dream!
A night a scene a town
A ride with Miss Camaraderie
An odyssey, oh, wow
Say what-what is you with ?
Rottweil, ima let you
In my house, Politer High Society,
Attire, tea, a style
Look how ya looking looking now!
Let me see you...see you smile
A smiler's sweetest smile
Oh mister, wider! - me oh wow...
Look how ya looking looking now

It’s the sound
The hip and hip and now
When I hip you…
Hip you hound, get down or get tied up and twound..
Who’s the hip new, bitch you found?
Politer sis- I’m bout it…
A pistol, pistol pow
Let's have a listen in papa
Let me witch you.. Witch you out
I ride I rip I rile at the ritu-ritual
What up what iz you with Rottweil
Tell me if you’ll
Be around.. To ride with miss camaraderie
An odyssey a sound…
What kind of wizard? …. What what what what what what……

I’ve been looking for someone sir, I'd've sworn you
Were on a journey searching for, my amour too

It's the sound, the hip and hip and now
Let me hip you, hip you hound
Get down and get tied up in twine
Let me twist you, twist you pal…
Ya shyer, sh-shy how can I get you, get you out?
Le'ts have a listen in, Rottweil(er)
