19 ContributorsRAIN Lyrics
I know you tried cryin'
It didn't help nothin', funny how the time flies
Middle school classmates in the Crime Times
These some tryin' times
My girl summertime fine, wintertime cold, too
Everybody won't accept nothin' but the old you
Giving you advice like I'm not gon' hold you
I wish you had 'cause you don't know what I go through
They don't know what you⁠—

They don't know what you go through
You keep it on the low, too
They tell me that they feel me
They tell me that its soulful
Type of shit that make the people tell you that it's so true
Right after you say it, 'cause they just feel like they know you
They just feel like they know you
But they don't know you
But they don't know you
But they don't⁠—

I know you tried cryin'
It didn't help nothin', funny how the time flies
Middle school classmates in the Crime Times
These some tryin' times
My girl summertime fine, wintertime cold, too
Everybody won't accept nothin' but the old you
Giving you advice like I'm not gon' hold you
I wish you had 'cause you don't know what I go through
You don't know what I⁠—
You might also likeI know you tried cryin'
It didn't help nothin', funny how the time flies
Middle school classmates in the Crime Times
These some tryin' times
My girl summertime fine, wintertime cold, too
Everybody won't accept nothin' but the old you
Giving you advice like I'm not gon' hold you
I wish you had 'cause you don't know what I go through
They don't know what you⁠—

They don't know what you dealin' with
They don't know ‘bout the empty spot you got and what you fill it with
You chasin' death for the thrill of it
The skeletons is comin' out the grave like the Thriller vid
I know you wish that you were still a kid
Woke up from a dream wishin' I was in the Ville again
I can see my pops silhouette in everything I do, but I don't see him anymore
It makes me wonder what I even do it for if I don't see him anymore
Will I be happy with the things that I achieve? And what's more
I don't even want to think what's in store for me (Store for me)
I wrote a note and I'ma leave it on the door
I hope you see it while you're leavin' 'cause I need for you to read it
Know you gave me little space, I think I need a little more
I wrote this for you 'cause you mean a little more to me to me
I know you tried cryin'
It didn't help nothin', funny how the time flies
Middle school classmates in the Crime Times
These some tryin' times
My girl summertime fine, wintertime cold, too
Everybody won't accept nothin' but the old you
Giving you advice like I'm not gon' hold you
I wish you had 'cause you don't know what I go through
They don't know what you⁠—Embed
