Yea Yea, uh
It's Carolina, nigga
Yeah
Ay
Fayettenam
Yeah!

Listen, alive and still kickin nigga
I survived the 'Ville
But a lot will not, so they wield Glocks and Bonnevilles
Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill
Money hungry, tryna find a meal
Can't stay inside and chill
Little niggas thinking "fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal"
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas
Lying like they on the pill
Preachers say we blessed
But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal
If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will
Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel gates
My mind is still racing, I'm tryna kill snakes
'Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so
Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build
It's kinda ill how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dawg, you gotta drill
It's kinda ill how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dawg, you gotta drill
Yeah

Yo, Coming home, y'all
Listen
At any given time, got the city on my mind
The city on my mind
The city on my mind
I'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
At any given time, Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Said "I feel ya pain nigga, but I'm tryna go for mine,"
I'm tryna go for mine
I'm tryna go for mine

Hey
Ay, fuck them hoes, let them bunnies be
Perfect vision I'm 20/20 for this money, G
See it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show
'Cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose
Money goes, the money come
Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things
Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks
The Carolina way
If you in college then you know the crime won't pay
Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say
'Cause in Carolina, we thorough
My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G-boro
And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?
The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'
Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo
Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl
So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte
No matter the city, man, Carolina shine, regardless!
Yeah
Yo, coming home nigga!
Riding big in an ol' school Chevy
With the windows down when I'm rolling through my city, like
Ooh!
On my way to meet up with a freak and my nigga drunk beating
She can hear me down the street, she like 'Ooh!'
Blew game and I do my thing
Ain't tryna settle down, I ain't shopping for no ring
Oh no!
Riding with my niggas for the weekend
Carolina sounds pumping out the speakers, like
Ooh!3Embed
