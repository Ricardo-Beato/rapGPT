4 ContributorsIâ€™m a G Lyrics
Two choppas and the extra clips
You know we keep them Glock 40s with them hollow tips (BOW!)
FYI you better wear yo vest
You now rockin' with the muhfuckin' best
Ride the track like my Cadillac, I Eslcalade
Niggas in my hood call me "Mr. Microwave" (Ha HAAAAA)
Shoulda worked at KFC I cook chickens all day
Ain't na'an nigga greater, I shoulda been a cater. (Daaaaamn)
17-5 will get you one of these
Best believe I ain't talkin' car keys
A hunnit grand, will make ya wrist glow
Gone cost you half of that to get ya boy for a show (AYE!)
Niggas like "Damn, the nerve of this nigga
I used to flip birds with this nigga."
Now it's Rap City, Mr. 106
Young nigga with the scale, now it's TRL (HA HAAAAA!)
And MTV too
If I was you, I'd hate me too
Wassup
Ha HAAAAA (Ha HAAAA)
Ay! I'm laughin' at y'all
I'm laughin' at you nigga

You can't stop the young nigga they call "Slick"
Premature ejaculation, I spit quick (OK!)
And I ain't Maceo, but I do flip quick
Disrespect the shield, man, you gotta get hit (BOW!)
I'm a young boss, all I do is nod and shit
Have niggas come through with them revolvers and shit
Now they bussin' at ya frame out the black '88
We let the work through like Bush in '88
You can't flex on us, man, the clique heavyweights
Niggas barely nibblin', big dinner on our plates
And chilly pimp jewelry got me laughin' in ya face
It's CTE nigga, better stay in ya place
