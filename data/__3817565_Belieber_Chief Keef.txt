Shawty said she was a dreamer (A dreamer)
I turned they asses to a believer (A believer)
My other bitch like Justin Bieber (Justin Bieber)

I still remember my hoes (My hoes)
I bet they still remember my growth (My growth)
Wave a bitch off my crown (My crown)
You only want me 'cause my life glow (My life glow)
All these bitches chasing after D (After D)
Tell these bitches, “Chase after cheese” (After cheese)
I forgot I'm the fuckin' cheese (Cheese)
I ride a 'Rari around, spending Gs (Spending Gs)
Who raised me, my momma, granny (Granny)
No actor, but I need a Grammy (A Grammy)
Taxin' niggas Uncle Sammy (Uncle Sammy)
Girl you know I'm Sosa Sammy (Sosa Sammy)
I don't be off the molly (The molly)
I just be off a lot of weed (A lot of weed)
Pull up, crash the party (Crash the party)
Shots at everybody (At everybody)
Can't be chasin' these hoes (These hoes)
Gotta be chasin' these rolls (These rolls)
I was dreamin' until I woke (I woke)
I ain't a dreamchaser, bitch, I just glo (I glo)
Sosa, you be flexin', I know (I know)
Sosa, you keep weapons, I know (I know)
I ain't got a yacht, I got a boat (I got a boat)
And that bitch is big as my home (As my home)
I was locked up Divison 4 (Divison 4)
Reppin' my set 'cause niggas hoes (Them niggas hoes)
I remember back in '94 ('94)
Wait, I was born in '95 though ('95 though)
'Member trappin' just to get a coat (Get a coat)
'Member trapping just to get some clothes (Get some clothes)
Now I buy anything I want (Anything I want)
Anything I want in any mall (In any mall, mo'fucka)
I ain't never been to Mexico (Mexico)
But I'm smokin' on Texaco (Texaco)
'Member pilin' up Volvos (Volvos)
Now I get 90 for 4 show (for 4 show)
My jewelry, it cost 4 shows (4 shows)
I threw it in the water and let it float (And let it float)
It's icy, like the fucking North Pole (North Pole)
I don't need no stylist for my wardrobe (My wardrobe)
Look, lady, I got the fuckin' pack (Pack)
And I got the motherfuckin' sack (Sack)
It's a lot of snakes in the grass (The grass)
Watch out, they'll bite you in yo back (Back)You might also like7Embed
