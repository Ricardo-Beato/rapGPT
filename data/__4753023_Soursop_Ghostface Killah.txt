7 ContributorsSoursop Lyrics
When I was just
Give  me light, light, light the way
Light  the way, give me light, give me light
Give me light, light, light, light
Light, light, light, light
Light,  light, light
Can  you light?
Can you light? Light, light the way
Light  the way, give me light, give me light
Give me light, light, light, light
Light, light, light, light
Light, light, light
Can  you light?

Yeah, yo
Bloodclaat, bust my gun like a rude boy
No Love & Hip Hop, bad attitude, boy
Jamaican Clarks, sippin' Guinness on the hot sand
Sun splash, I'm on after Elephant Man
My posse paddle through the Cayman in a small canoe
Chewin' on chew sticks, blowin' on ganja root
Fonto leaf, Irish moss, soursop
Big nets catchin' monk fish, spice for the crockpot
The powder is wrapped, lookin' like baby roadies
Machine gun mask on, lookin' like a bunch of goalies
The half a foot dread, the whole land call him Toby
He got a team of red beam that'll lean the police
Christoper Coke, the pistol'll smoke gutters
We out in Kingston grooming the dirt for the butters
Sharpened machetes that slice through the trees for berries
Busting coconuts, Selassie legendary

When I was just
Give me light, light, light the way
Light the way, give me light, give me light
Give me light, light, light, light
Light, light, light, light
Light, light, light
Can you light?
Can you light? Light, light the way
Light the way, give me light, give me light
Give me light, light, light, light
Light, light, light, light
Light, light, light
Can you light?

Siddly, diddly, diddly, diddly, diddly, diddly, and truly (Right)
No search and fiddle (Right)
Diddly, diddly, diddly, and truly
First class (Brrt)
Cold blooded murderer (Right)
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em what them ah really require (Right)
Cold blooded murderer
Wu-Tang the definition of a soldier

Check the Tiger Bone, stole love don, I sip a megaton
On point, soldiers is armed and blow the best corn
Fly silks and wallies, women from Jamaica to Bali
Acknowledge me at the show and prove rowdy
I miss Allah Real still, I build with this peace of steel
They call the microphone chrome nickel-plated poems
Jamel Ireef and Iron Man Tone, respect shown
In Jamaica, there's a party, peace to all my natty
Eatin' swordfish and I keep sliced avocado
Rice and peas and items sweet like a mango
One hundred clip rifle blow, steady flow, rhythm, tempo
"More fire," the sample go, so
Peace to Fire House, Waltham, Havendale to Maverley
Jungle to Rema, Salt Lane to Tivoli
Gaza, Spanish Town, Trenchtown, back to Maxfield
'Nough respect due, everything real
When I was justEmbed
