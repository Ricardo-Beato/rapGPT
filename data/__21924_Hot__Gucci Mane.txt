7 ContributorsHot! Lyrics
I cut the stove on, and get the pie, hot
It's finna get hot
So put your mask on, and lick some shots, hot
It's finna get hot

Man oh it gon' be a cold summer
Ice on my belly so that means I got a cold stomach
(YEAHHH!) And my watch it cost a cool hundred
Charm cost me two hundred
Flexin' with this new money (BURR)
Got that don't know what to do money
28 Ashantis got my old school lookin too funny
Hahaha, and this paint job cost a cool twenty
Got it washed by 2 junkies
Burnin' on that good chronic
Huh? A flat 40 a red monkey
Try to CEO I leave you funky like a dead donkey
Geah, I hope you heard what I just said homie
Thought you were my dog 'til that nigga put the feds on me
So nigga go and tell on me
I'ma get this bread homie, I ain't never scared homie
Huh? Hope you heard what I just said homie
You can go and tell on me, I'ma get this bread homie

I cut the stove on, and get the pie, hot
It's finna get hot
So put your mask on, and lick some shots, hot
It's finna get hot

In the club on that good barney
Shawty smokin' weed but it smellin' like that wood burnin'
Stop! In Magic City on a good Monday
Got it rainin' good money, hoes make it good for me
Go go go, I told lil' momma what she could juug for me
Shawty kept it hood, lil' momma out here catchin' juugs for me
I told my plug he need to send somethin'
Shawty she a rider she said she down to do 10 for me
Uhh, and I let her get it in for me
Comin' through the upper right now strapped down with them things for me
Uhh, and the girl know how to spend money
Baby want that real money, show you how to lay in money
(Yeahhh!) I told her all I do is cash hundreds
Lookin' like that cash money, I be makin' fast money
Uhh, but nigga if you trick your last money
If you trick your last money, nigga you a damn dummy

I cut the stove on, and get the pie, hot
It's finna get hot
So put your mask on, and lick some shots, hot
It's finna get hot
I hit the club, gon' leave my car runnin
Why you leave your car runnin' ? I'm just gon' be five minutes
(Zoom) Man, I pull me about 9 women
It did take me 9 minutes, but I needed 9 jimmies
(Yeahhh!) Make these girls grant all my 9 wishes
All you player haters need to get the fuck out my bid'ness
Uhh, man I think I got 'bout 9 Hemmes
9 millimeter on me and he got the 9 for me

I cut the stove on, and get the pie, hot
It's finna get hot
So put your mask on, and lick some shots, hot
It's finna get hot
I cut the stove on, and get the pie, hot
It's finna get hot
So put your mask on, and lick some shots, hot
It's finna get hot1Embed
