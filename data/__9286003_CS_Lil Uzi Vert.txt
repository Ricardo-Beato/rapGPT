When the roads all merge into one
You're forced to drive, ah
Woah

Wake up
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up
Why'd you leave the keys up on the table?
Here you go, create another fable (You wanted to)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup (You wanted to)
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up (You wanted to)
Why'd you leave the keys up on thе table? (You wanted to)

I don't think you trust in my (My)
Self-rightеous suicide
And I cry (And I cry) when angels
When angels deserve to die

Wake up
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up
Why'd you leave the keys up on the table?
Here you go, create another fable (You wanted to)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup (You wanted to)
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up (You wanted to)
Why'd you leave the keys up on the table? (You wanted to)
You might also like
I don't think you trust in my (Trust in my)
Self-righteous suicide
And I cry (And I cry) when angels
When angels deserve to die

Now I'm on edge, standing on this ledge
Ain't wanna ask me how I feel
Too late (I wanted to)
