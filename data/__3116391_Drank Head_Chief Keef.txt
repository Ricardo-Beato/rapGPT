16 ContributorsDrank Head Lyrics
What?
I said I wanna see you
I'll pay for my own flight out there, I just wanna see you
You said what?
I said I wanna see you
I'll pay for my own flight out there, I just wanna see you
Okay Kool-aid
When?

I'm a real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Remember when Tech used to come in a coffin
Remember Actavis came with a double seal
And I had just poured me a 12 of Wock
You can keep the Qualitest all to yourself
Cause nigga I'm a real drank head, real drank head
You ain't sipping drank, that shit hit
Hoes in my car, asking me for a cup, that's his bitch
I should've known she ain't sip drink when she said Qualitest was better than Actavis
I called cuban for 12 pints of Wock, any other nigga better know that he's taxing shit

It's payday every day
You ain't tryna fuck, bitch, skate
Can't come through, ball and no chain
Adios, knock 'em back to 5th grade
And what I'm sippin' on a milkshake
I'm sharper than a switchblade
All hundreds on me, but I'm on a rampage
My ice kicking ass, no MMA
Yeah, I'm sippin' Hardt
I just poured a 12, you be pouring 4's
You be sipping yellow, you be sipping green
That shit deadly, you need to stick to weed
I got 20 pints up in my closet
They gon' be down for the week up
This bitch got up in my car
Told the bitch put on a seatbelt
She steady asking how to lift the seat up
Had the nerve to ask me for a lean cup
Where your ass was at for the re-up?
The drank just hit with me a prenup
Bang, bang

I'm a real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Remember when Tech used to come in a coffin
Remember Actavis came with a double seal
And I had just poured me a 12 of Wock
You can keep the Qualitest all to yourself
Cause nigga I'm a real drank head, real drank head
You ain't sipping drank, that shit hit
Hoes in my car, asking me for a cup, that's his bitch
I should've known she ain't sip drink when she said Qualitest was better than Actavis
I called cuban for 12 pints of Wock, any other nigga better know that he's taxing shit

I'm up in Houston where this shit came from
Didn't know about bank accounts, I went and made one
You got red in here, get away from my dope
This bitch too damn playful, spilled drank on my clothes
Love no thotties, I don't
Hopped out of a Rhino
Your life fugazi, you need to undo
Backspace, typeover
Drank made me go, "I need you" (need you)
If it ain't purple then I can't see you (see you)
Bitch just text me saying "I'm gon' freak you when I see you"
I'm a well known nigga, you a Dr. Doolittle
I'm sipping on beetlejuice
Call a camera man, it's a photoshoot
Me and 20 pints, I pour 'em by the 2
Bang, bang
I'm a real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Real drank head, real drank head, real drank head
Remember when Tech used to come in a car
Remember Actavis came with a double seal
And I had just poured me a 12 of Wock
You can keep the Qualitest all to yourself
Cause nigga I'm a real drank head, real drank head
You ain't sipping drank, that shit hit
Hoes in my car, asking me for a cup, that's his bitch
I should've known she ain't sip drink when she said Qualitest was better than Actavis
I called cuban for 12 pints of Wock, any other nigga better know that he's taxing shit1Embed
