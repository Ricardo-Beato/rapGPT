Migos, what
Chains on my motherfucking neck
Bitch I'ma die by my respect

Chains on my motherfucking neck
Bitch I'ma die by my respect
Came in the door with that Tec
Came in the door just for the check
Chains on my motherfucking neck
Bitch I'ma die by my respect
Came in the door with that Tec
Came in the door just for the check

4 chains on my neck all cost a fifty checks
That's 50 plus 50 plus 50 plus 50
Doggin out your hoe, cause I'm having all this dab
Had a Uber pick her up, that's the modern day taxi cab
Came from the north nigga
Bando with a fork nigga
Shmoney gang, Migos gang, shooters up north nigga
Riding 'round town with a cutie of the cookies
Some of you rappers is pussy
Flexing in front of the footage (flex)
Keep a Cuban, no Gooding
But my niggas got the good en (gas)
Look at your bitch told her get in
I'm getting my young Tiger Wood in
All this work a nigga put in
Salute me when you see me then
Free my niggas in the pen
That's how a nigga came in
You might also like
Chains on my motherfucking neck
Bitch I'ma die by my respect
Came in the door with that Tec
Came in the door just for the check
Chains on my motherfucking neck
Bitch I'ma die by my respect
Came in the door with that Tec
Came in the door just for the check

Came in that door for the check and shit
Invisible set diamond necklace
Pay my due to and walked my shoes
Young rich nigga, respect this shit
Mama said that I'm intelligent
I'm dabbing on niggas, go excellent
Plug sent me a bird it was heaven sent
If you ain't Migo gang then you irrevelent
Came in the game, I stayed and changed the game, a nigga talk slang
Rather be  rich fuck the fame
But some of you niggas change up on some change
I'm blowing shit up like Hussein
Any nigga wanna pull up with me, tell 'em pull up and just say their name
The chopper is 'bout to decapitate brains
All I wanted was the check
Diamonds on my wrist and neck
Making money, niggas calling me Mitch
Rick James, I'm rich
A lot of niggas start dabbing
A lot of niggas said they haven't
That's a lot of hoes in my kitchen
Kim Kardashian's with no panties
Chains on my motherfucking neck
Bitch I'ma die by my respect
Came in the door with that Tec
Came in the door just for the check
Chains on my motherfucking neck
Bitch I'ma die by my respect
Came in the door with that Tec
Came in the door just for the check1Embed
