8 ContributorsLIFE Lyrics
Just let it talk to the heart
Just let me talk to it
Yeah

Blessed with a mind, to help me shine to the throne
Didn't have any supporter, had to grind on my own
And where I’m from, you get sprayed, like the finest cologne
So if they shoot, you better duck, else you'll be dying alone
Consider yourself lucky when you listen to this
I told y'all I was the greatest, I predicted this shit
It’s funny cuz the same girls, sucking and licking the dick
Will go home and just start kissing their kids
And they always back for more, like why they bother us
I told you I'll call back, just soon as my father does
And when they doubt themselves, it start to build up a lot of lust
I do it all to make them proud, but that's still not enough
But fuck it, that's just the art of anticipation
She fucked the judge and the litigation
And why them niggas hating
Cuz I be flowing like irrigation and perennation
Had to rush and drop the tape, because the man was patient
No pun intended, I'm at the doctors, I'm ill as fuck
I'm healing up, they not feeling you, you not real enough
And to be honest dawg, you really suck
Find another hobby ASAP, please give it up
But fuck it
I'm recording a tape up in my mama’s basement
And when it would start to get late man, she would fucking hate it
I told her "I’ll take care of payments when I fucking make it"
So I'm at home grinding, while y’all get fucking wasted
But mom told me this rap shit is a waste of time
Like nigga why you doing this, you haven't made a dime
Won't even listen to my song, like what's your favorite line
But to cop my next album, y’all gon' wait in lines
For real and parents said that we gon' make it soon
We better nigga, I'm hungry like where's my plate of food
Remember when you dropped Training Day and they hated you
If I made it, you made it too, we gonna make it fool
I swear, I fucking love it when they envy me
So shout out to my haters, you the real MVP
And easily, the nicest coming out the DMV

I can't seem to find my toothbrush, so I'll pick one up when I go out today. Other than that, I'm in good shape. 1Embed
