5 ContributorsCase Closed Lyrics
Motherfucker with one little single
Three or four Caimans under your belt
One good game gonna put you in the Hall of Fame motherfucker, nahmean?
Got one hit think you an all star baby
Ha, you sure got somethin to learn, rookie ass nigga
It's the big hill baby, stand strong motherfucker, what

Don't trip when you hit the lunatic, transmit ah shit
Break it down for the bitches and don't slip
You wish, get a grip you talkin with loose lips
Runnin your mouth, give you a tip, eat a dick
Huffin and puffin now you the man, understand this
Dumb motherfuckers explode up in the push persist
Keep movin with no lyrics, your spirit's broke
Sounds like you got a dick caught in your throat
Huh, hit wood-a takin you under a down low
Shitting on your one single and carry O's
Hold up; let me slow down the catch up
Before you open up your mouth for the kick to the gut
Pure breed, raw killer, rhyme thriller
Spit fire like Godzilla, the mad willer
Swingin over the beat, you ready, hold steady
You come across, biting the bullet and be the boss
Hard, sit-cars, you wanna floss guitars quick
You rapping like you wrapping your lips around my dick
Nobody told me to stop until I bust in your face
Got your rhyme Puffy, sprayin the mace, the case closed
Expose the whack nigga who chose to pose high
Figure burial, up in the hills, the gravedigger, nigga
