7 ContributorsGrindmode (The Marathon) Lyrics
Fly, fly, fly...
Fly, fly, fly...
Fly, fly, fly...
Fly, fly, fly...

The best position in my life, my future's looking bright
Them Gucci's on my face but I'm not blinded by the light
I'm out here in grind mode
I'm out here in grind mode
The best position in my life, my future's looking bright
Them Gucci's on my face but I'm not blinded by the light
I'm out here in grind mode
I'm out here in grind mode

Ain't have no pot to piss in
Now I'm on yachts with bitches
My flow is not the sickest?
You niggas common-sense-less
We at the round table pa-pa-pa politicking
Like F-A-B we R.I.P. our competition
No opposition, just a flock of bitches
The roof crack, trunk open they saw my vision
Them bright lights had her eyes itching
But she not tripping cuz she just wanna take flight witcha
You might also like
Clear up off my runway
I'm bout to catch flight
Clouds on my freeway
I'ma coast my kite
Fly fly fly
So tell em that I came for the game, and I took it
Fly fly fly
There's weather in these skies, it never shook me
Fly fly fly
The captain of my plane, so I gotta dip it
Fly fly fly
You see my eyes tell me if you see my vision on my
Fly fly fly
My nigga doing life, my brother's in the grave
Fly fly fly
I feel like it's my duty my nigga to spread my wings
Fly fly fly
And all I do is fly, and fly away
One day I hope you all, gon' fly away nigga

The best position in my life, my future's looking bright
Them Gucci's on my face but I'm not blinded by the light
I'm out here in grind mode
I'm out here in grind mode
The best position in my life, my future's looking bright
Them Gucci's on my face but I'm not blinded by the light
I'm out here in grind mode
I'm out here in grind mode
Perrier sipping, Benz drop dipping
Real fly cripping nigga
All money business nigga
Cross country tripping nigga
First class sitting nigga
When I touch down it's like a 5 grand interest nigga
You know what I'm into nigga
Money and expensive bitches
Fuck em on expensive linen
Then put on expensive denim
Five stacks in each pocket
What you niggas know about it?
I stay on that shit that make your bitch act a ho around me

Clear up off my runway
I'm bout to catch flight
Clouds on my freeway
I'ma coast my kite
Fly fly fly
So tell em that I came for the game, and I took it
Fly fly fly
There's weather in these skies, it never shook me
Fly fly fly
The captain of my plane, so I gotta dip it
Fly fly fly
You see my eyes tell me if you see my vision on my
Fly fly fly
My nigga doing life, my brother's in the grave
Fly fly fly
I feel like it's my duty my nigga to spread my wings
Fly fly fly
And all I do is fly, and fly away
One day I hope you all, gon' fly away niggaEmbed
