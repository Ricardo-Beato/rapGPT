83 ContributorsBenz Friendz (Whatchutola) Lyrics
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
I told that bitch, I told that bitch (Yeah)
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
This for the niggas with Benzes and the niggas without 'em
Scram, ho! (Ehh)

I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
And I don't want no bitch who need to have that kind of friendship
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho (Yeah)
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga—scram, ho

These cars don't mean shit (Uh-uh)
These hoes don't mean shit (Uh-uh)
These clothes don't mean shit (Uh-uh)
These shows don't mean shit, ho-oh
Whatchutola, what, whatchutola (Ho-oh)
Whatchutola, what, whatchutola
These cars don't mean shit (Uh-uh)
These hoes don't mean shit (Uh-uh)
These clothes don't mean shit (Uh-uh)
These shows don't mean shit, ho-oh
Whatchutola, what, whatchutola (Ho-oh)
Whatchutola, what, whatchutola (Yeah-yeah)
You might also like
Graduated from the fabricated sabotages
Conversated with a lady goin' Lambo crazy
Bitch, you better cut it, shawty, I'm 'bout to cut you off
Oh, you greedy in Tahiti, I can seen your flaw
Ayy, tell that girl you 'bout to sell the work 'cause you tired of it
And see how she react when you're no longer in your Bimmer
Then she find out that the Bentley wasn't really rented
Can you sell a kilo? Help a nigga move a kilo?
Oh, you want the private jet to take a flight to Rio?
Can't no Maybach prevent a nigga from making mula
Oh, you gold-diggin', diggin', graveyard loser
Ain't none of my cars American, King of Zamunda (Hey)
Let's have a heart-to-heart, drink wine, make art (Whoa-oh)
Backseat of the Benzo, the AMG (Ayy)
Can you love a thug, is all make-believe
Pure fantasy, I see through it easily (Ehh)

I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
And I don't want no bitch who need to have that kind of friendship
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga—scram, ho
I told the girl I'm 'bout to sell the Porsche, I'm tired of it
She go and told these folks I'm goin' broke, a smile poured
From my lips, 'cause if I'm broke, it's only hearted
Broken records from broken English, that's all it
Hol' up, and if I were, why?
Would you throw a party? (Can't have it)
Affection is so convenient when ballin'
Correction: These hoes don't mean it when fallin'
I guess that's why Lois can't be with Clark Kent
Fly on a nigga back while he Superman
But if I'm in a wheelchair, you still there?
Stop searchin' for words, I feel stupid, man
The shit is the Pittsburgh, I still care
White button downs and Emory scrubs
Had to write her birthday down because my memory sucks
But this shit comes back up like some acid reflux
Or a Michael Jackson jacket with some plastic zippers
I was zipping through the city and I'on't give a fuck
1994 Toyota Land Cruiser because
That bitch ain't never broke down on me
Why would I do that to her?
Simple-ism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it
'Cause if I buy one, they gon' sell ten, and what I'm left with?
Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk (Hey)
'Til then, I will ride my fuckin' bike, or walk—eh
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
And I don't want no bitch who need to have that kind of friendship
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga, scram, ho

I told that girl, I told that girl tell the truth
Say she the realest bitch I ever met, then show me some proof
These girls be droppin' these lies, these girls be makin' shit up
She don't wanna stand in my line, she tryna come to the front
Yeah-uh, she love her country but hate American cars
For the shape of them, he'll have you know all of them bitches is foreign
If yellow seems to be the color in fashion
What happens to all of this good Black pussy he keep ignoring?
The world told him didn't shit rhyme with "orange"
The girl is only with him because he's touring
Well, go on, angel, I don't blame you, don't hang your head
I know it's survival for you, get it like a IOU
She's so materialistic
I'm just enjoying life, I'm living life, you know?
That worldwide pussy, yeah, worldwide pussy, yeah
Pull up at this girl crib bumping Lil' Boosie, yeah

I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
And I don't want no bitch who need to have that kind of friendship
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga—scram, ho

These cars don't mean shit (Uh-uh)
These hoes don't mean shit (Uh-uh)
These clothes don't mean shit (Uh-uh)
These shows don't mean shit, ho-oh
Whatchutola, what, whatchutola (Ho-oh)
Whatchutola, what, whatchutola

We drive these cars on the regular
This life that I live is incredible
We gon' be fly whenever, we gettin' richer forever
Without these foreign vehicles, can we still be together? Tell me83Embed
