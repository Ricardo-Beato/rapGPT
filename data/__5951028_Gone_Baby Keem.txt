7 ContributorsGone Lyrics
I feel like I need a fan, want a fan and again
Know I got it on my wrist then I hit it, then I go
When I go, when I'm gone, and I'm gone
And I'm gone and I'm vibing in the function
'Member I was damned in a car with a group full of niggas that had nothing to say
I'm one hundred chill and I wanna live my life baby
I wanna be good, i wanna be okay
I feel like I need a fan, want a fan and again
Know I got it on my wrist then I hit it, then I go
When I go, when I'm gone, and I'm gone
And I'm gone and I'm vibing in the function
'Member I was damned in a car with a group full of niggas that had nothing to say
I'm one hundred chill and I wanna live my life baby
I wanna be good, i wanna be okay

Young niggas can hate on the kid and y'all want to
I'ma keep balling, keep it crazy like I front to
I'ma look out for my niggas, I won't front you
She look independеnt, like a very long front to
If they see you high, your namе, I shoot you
Hands in the sky, your name, I shoot you
I'm a good kid, baby, I just wanna do you
I'm a good kid, baby, I just wanna 'stroy you, whoa
You might also like
I feel like I need a fan, want a fan and again
Know I got it on my wrist then I hit it, then I go
When I go, when I'm gone, and I'm gone
And I'm gone and I'm vibing in the function
'Member I was damned in a car with a group full of niggas that had nothing to say
I'm one hundred chill and I wanna live my life baby
I wanna be good, i wanna be okay
I feel like I need a fan, want a fan and again
Know I got it on my wrist then I hit it, then I go
When I go, when I'm gone, and I'm gone
And I'm gone and I'm vibing in the function
'Member I was damned in a car with a group full of niggas that had nothing to say
I'm one hundred chill and I wanna live my life baby
I wanna be good, i wanna be okay

Alone in the room by myself
Ask if I ever wanna fall in love again
Bitches wanna follow me and make feel loved then all of a sudden hit the switch
I'ma play a role and then hit the switch
I'ma turn a light on and then hit the switch
I'ma have a life up and then get too rich
I'ma have nice well and then hit the switch, woah

I feel like I need a fan, want a fan and again
Know I got it on my wrist then I hit it, then I go
When I go, when I'm gone, and I'm gone
And I'm gone and I'm vibing in the function
'Member I was damned in a car with a group full of niggas that had nothing to say
I'm one hundred chill and I wanna live my life baby
I wanna be good, i wanna be okay
I feel like I need a fan, want a fan and again
Know I got it on my wrist then I hit it, then I go
When I go, when I'm gone, and I'm gone
And I'm gone and I'm vibing in the function
'Member I was damned in a car with a group full of niggas that had nothing to sayEmbed
