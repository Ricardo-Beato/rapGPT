Hold up
You know what I'm sayin'? Kesha and them back there
Yeah, Kesha
You know what I'm sayin'? Got motherfuckin' Redd in this bitch, you know what I'm sayin'?
Know what I'm sayin'? Real player shit
Me and my bitch, nigga
Yeah, me and my ho, nigga (Yeah)
We do this shit with my bitch, nigga (Yeah)
You know what I'm sayin'? We do this shit for my bitch, nigga, Tony
Walk in that shit, take over that bitch

I'm in a hood where niggas don't bother me (Check it out)
Thirty-five hundred my cardigan (Check it out)
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me (Check it out)
Shawty gon' get on top of me (What? What? What? What?)
All of this ice in the summertime
Ain't no boy fucking with Carti, nah

I'm in this bitch with Yung Carti (Carti)
Riding 'round with the top down (What?)
All these bitches so naughty (What?)
They tryna fuck on us right now (Uh)
If Carti with it, then I'm ridin' (Yeah)
Got a hundred on the neck (What?)
Ain't no stoppin', bitch, I'm poppin'
You see this Rollie and this chain
Bitch, I'm so icy, I'm cocky
Just dropped a fifty on my jeweler
And told him make sure it's shiny
It's Coldhearted and she got a stick
Right beside me, I'ma let it hit
I ain't really with the sucker shit
These niggas around me, you know they with it, yeah
These niggas around me you know they with it, yeah
They toting them Glocks and them dirty sticks, yeah
About Coldhearted, they gon' pull up quick, yeah
They ready for war, yeah, you know they with it, yeah
You might also like
Yeah, me and my ho, nigga (Yeah)
We do this shit with my bitch, nigga (Yeah)
You know what I'm sayin'? I can't really complain 'bout shit, man
Everything good, you know what I'm sayin'?
Walk in that shit, take over that bitch
Fuck nigga don't want no problem

I'm in a hood where niggas don't bother me (Check it out)
Thirty-five hundred my cardigan (Check it out)
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me (Check it out)
Shawty gon' get on top of me (What? What? What? What?)
All of this ice in the summertime
Ain't no boy fucking with Carti, nah

I'm in a hood where niggas don't bother me
Thirty-five hundred my cardigan (Cardigan)
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me
Shawty gon' get on top of me
I'm in a hood where niggas don't bother me
Thirty-five hundred my cardigan (Cardigan)

Shawty gon' get on top of me
I'm in a hood where niggas don't bother me
Thirty-five hundred my cardigan (Cardigan)
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me
Shawty gon' get on top of me (Top of me)10Embed
