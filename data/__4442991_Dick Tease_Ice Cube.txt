2 ContributorsDick Tease Lyrics
(Let's go!)
All the freaks in this muthafucka, turn around
Drop it like it's hot, take it to the ground
Jack it like a '4, girl, up and down
Do the dick tease, I'ma tell you how

Stick your ass out, hands on your knees (Go shorty)
Move your body, girl, do the dick tease
Stick your ass out, hands on your knees (Go shorty)
Act like you're 'bout to do a strip tease

(Y'all know me) I hit the spot with a knot full of hot shit
Andn keep it gangsta like a nigga ain't got shit
Y'all know I got it, bitches ain't gotta spot it
Hit the dance floor, women get so erotic
Sweat drippin' off, nigga wanna Crip walk
But I stay close, jump on these huevos (Let's go!)
Shake it, mami mami, let me see you get loose
Back a nigga up, make me call Jesus
Don't fall, grab them hips like handlebars
After this, baby, we got to handle ours
Got nerve, don't trip, let's swerve
'Til this hit the curb, high heel and Converse
Didn't say word, just backed a nigga down
I looked around with a shitty ass frown (Oh!)
Put my hands up, nigga, West Coast style (Oh!)
To drive a nigga wild, here's what you do now
You might also like
Stick your ass out, hands on your knees (Go shorty)
Move your body, girl, do the dick tease
Stick your ass out, hands on your knees (Go shorty)
Act like you're 'bout to do a strip tease
Stick your ass out, hands on the ground (Go shorty)
Up and down, let a nigga get up under it
Ass out, hands on the ground (Go shorty)
Up and down, show a nigga what you're workin' wit'

I'm comin' through but I'm always late
Fuckin' wit' hoes tryin' to play Elimidate (Y'all know me)
Don't be dancin' with that nigga that'll hate (Uh-uh)
I'm irate when that booty gyrate (Come here)
I'ma have your ass pop out a cake
And show my niggas that California quake (Let's go!)
Harlem Shake them country pancakes
I see your titties, girl, I know your back aches
I know your thighs sore (What!), from the dance floor (What!)
But don't stop 'cause a nigga need an encore
You see me lookin' at ya, I know you're lookin' back
Tap my nigga like, "Damn, nigga, look at that"
You need a road map to find that pussycat
Ass so fat, you got to show that
Please turn around, please look back
I wanna look in your face when you put that
Ass out, hands on your knees (Go shorty)
Move your body, girl, do the dick tease
Stick your ass out, hands on your knees (Go shorty)
Act like you're 'bout to do a strip tease
Stick your ass out, hands on the ground (Take it to the floor)
Up and down, let a nigga get up under it
Ass out, hands on the ground (Take it to the floor)
Up and down, show a nigga what you're workin' wit'

All the freaks in this muthafucka, turn around
Drop it like it's hot, take it to the ground
Jack it like a '4, girl, up and down
Do the dick tease, I'ma tell you how

To everybody in the house gettin' fucked up
Who don't give a shit, put your cups up (Cups up!)
Don't talk to the bitch if she's stuck up (Stuck up!)
Just let her keep rollin' with her ass on her shoulders
Keep it movin' - girl, you got shit on your collar
What the fuck can a nigga get for a dollar?
I'ma holla at the freak with no problem (Get it!)
With a young nigga comin' straight from the bottom
And I got 'em, doin' that shit mama taught 'em
On her way to the floor, everybody spot 'em
Dance floor too packed, hit a gold room
So I could step back, nigga, see the boom boom
So I could step up real close to the womb
If it feel warm, baby might feel the boom
If I talk the right shit, baby might get a room
Might fuck all night, might check out at noon
Stick your ass out (What!), hands on your knees (And do what?)
Move your body, girl, do the dick tease
Stick your ass out (What!), hands on your knees (And do what?)
Act like you're 'bout to do a strip tease

All the freaks in this muthafucka, turn around
Drop it like it's hot, take it to the ground
Jack it like a '4, girl, up and down
Do the dick tease, I'ma tell you how
All the freaks in this muthafucka, turn around (Turn around)
Drop it like it's hot, take it to the ground (To the floor)
Jack it like a '4, girl, up and down
Do the dick tease, I'ma tell you how (Y'all know me)

Let me put my hands on your ass like that
Let me put my hands on your ass like that
Let me put my hands on your ass like that
Let me put my hands on your ass like that
Let me put my hands on your ass like that
Let me put my hands on your ass like that
Let me put my hands on your ass like that
Let me put my hands on your ass like thatEmbed
