Is it real like niggas claimin', "stay to this"
Let me answer that question while I'm aiming this
Hear them one good time, is he faking kid?
Not bleeding like that, he gonna need a shit bag
Lay the fuck up, suck it through from a tube
A million dollars won't even put my feet in his shoes (check it out)
Niggas lose they life, hey that's nature
And niggas die when they try gangsta, niggas
Straight pussy, I can smell that shit
There's only one way that I can duse that shit
Slugs comin' through, better move that shit
He was gangsta but he died tryin' ta prove that shit
Them QB niggas, too grimey for y'all
We stick together, fuck what you heard in the song
The 41st Side, and that love go long
Niggas screamin' out, "dunn"
And we put y'all on...

So fuck y'all niggas
Buck y'all niggas
Ain't no way you can touch my niggas
Try my nigga
Die my nigga
All y'all niggas...my gats spittin'
So fuck y'all niggas
Buck y'all niggas
Ain't no way you can touch my niggas
Try my nigga
Die my nigga
All y'all niggas...my gats spittin'

Aiyo
You feel my niggas when we come through, thuggin' it
You lovin' it, the way we at ball like the government
I'm 1/3 President, the AB, the medicine, we OD heavenly
You fuckin' with veterans who's better than us
The In-fa-mous
We crush crab niggas to dust and sweep-o-mop
When the heat raise up
Ain't no ifs, ands, or buts
The most scandalous, make your blood rush
Through your body like it ain't never did before
We the mall, and we guarantee the realist of all
My spirit is torn
My guns is long
My team is strong
We king kong niggas when the heat is on
And no matter if I'm wrong or right
Believe me, I'm right
If anything else, nigga prepare to fight
Like, nuckle up, get your face bowl up
Or, buckle up and get shot the fuck down
Cause we got 4 pounds that don't make no sounds
Real creepy, so be careful when you see me, breathe easy
Believe me, it's far from what you see on tv
It's real life drama, you wouldn't want to be me...
So fuck y'all niggas
Buck y'all niggas
Ain't no way you can touch my niggas
Try my nigga
Die my nigga
All y'all niggas...my gats spittin'
So fuck y'all niggas
Buck y'all niggas
Ain't no way you can touch my niggas
Try my nigga
Die my nigga
All y'all niggas...my gats spittin'

Aiyo
There ain't no niggas on the face of the map, fuckin' with this
Infamous, y'all, that dominant mall
Just park your attention on my dogs, it's us
We the ones with that dope shit
That cold crush
We burn 'em up, turn it up, it's on
We gonna do it 'til it death us, fuck yo' thoughts
Niggas be plottin' to dead us, they move in veine
Get they head bust open, it's not a thing
So rap fo' these niggas
My team is tough
It's not a game, motherfucka
We cleanin' up
Gettin' that money, motherfucka
You king or what
We use your head, dunn, it's right there
Get you some
You lack strength, motherfucka
Better get you some
For's me, I'm more than a family, dunn
And we handles our business
And continue to bang
And chump niggas
Grow and get bigger, flow and get richer
So fuck y'all niggas
Buck y'all niggas
Ain't no way you can touch my niggas
Try my nigga
Die my nigga
All y'all niggas...my gats spittin'
So fuck y'all niggas
Buck y'all niggas
Ain't no way you can touch my niggas
Try my nigga
Die my nigga
All y'all niggas...my gats spittin'1Embed
