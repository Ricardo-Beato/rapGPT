You dig what I'm saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast, yeah
Wanted money, I couldn't enjoy a class
I'm a big old player, I got it from my dad, hey
Lil' mama dig what I'm sayin'
Keep it funky like an egg and you will never land
All my niggas they don't play, they all want it bad
My son a boss, he a lil bitty motherfucking man
I go crazy, I go brazy for these fucking bands
Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands
He so crazy, I'm not lazy, I want fucking bands yo

I'm a boss, fuck that bitch out on the balcony
I might take a picture and tell 'em to caption this
When I'm done fingering, I need a napkin and shit
Ocho Cinco, yes sir I'm catching it
Catch it, catch catch it, catch it catch it catch it
I'll take your necklace, I'll leave you neckless
I might not be cussin' but I ain't bluffin'
Niggas want problems, it's not nothing
I'm screaming bring it on like Gabrielle
I'm a real big dog, I don't kiss and tell, hell
First you want it, then second, you pale, yeah
Don't think he quick, he pulled up like a snail, oh
Water in his eyes, I let that sucker go
And I forgot to tell her that you were po
I'm not doing a twenty year sentence about you, you a ho
You might also like
But do you dig what I'm saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast, yeah
Wanted money, I couldn't enjoy a class
I'm a big old player, I got it from my dad, hey
Lil' mama dig what I'm sayin'
Keep it funky like an egg and you will never land
All my niggas they don't play, they all want it bad
My son a boss, he a lil bitty motherfucking man
I go crazy, I go brazy for these fucking bands
Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands
He so crazy, I'm not lazy, I want fucking bands, yo

Yes sir, baby, yes sir
Take her nigga, flex her
I burn her while you turning her up
And I got on Chucks but Young Thugger not stuck
Swear, swear, swear, I swear on slime nigga
You break a rule on him or her, you get fined, nigga
These niggas know I run it up so they donâ€™t try, nigga
I might screw you bitch with my broke pliers, nigga
Hell, yeah, all my cars they go fish tail
Hell, yeah, I'm YSL 'til I'm dead and pale
Kickin you niggas, getting money slow just like a snail
I told her the mail is how they send them bales
I can never be him, but you can wish me well
I came a long way from shopping at clearance sales
She let me cum in her hair just like some gel
I'm a real Blood, I know you smell
You dig what I'm saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast, yeah
Wanted money, I couldn't enjoy a class
I'm a big old player, I got it from my dad, hey
Lil' mama dig what I'm sayin'
Keep it funky like an egg and you will never land
All my niggas they don't play, they all want it bad
My son a boss, he a lil bitty motherfucking man
I go crazy, I go brazy for these fucking bands
Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands
He so crazy, I'm not lazy, I want fucking bands yo20Embed
