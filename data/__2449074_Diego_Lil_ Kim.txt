We all in Margielas
They treat me just like Griselda, nigga
These bitches is jealous
They just can't understand a bitch, no
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know

We moving that Blanco, that Blanco
They wanna be Blanco, I'm Blanco (I'm Blanco)
I got all this work like I'm El Chapo
Just made a million, I need 8 mo'

They call me Blanco
They treat me just like Griselda, nigga
Just call of the plug
And tell him that I'ma be at him, nigga
I'm whipping the Wraith
I feel like I'm in space from the roof
I trap out the coupe

They call me Blanco
I get that work from El Poncho
Driving it back from California
Like Juice in the Bronco
Quarter mill get you cinco
That's wholesale, lil' nigga
Oh, your girl got you locked down
Need to post bail, lil' nigga
Stand still, this ain't a treadmill
This a belt scale, lil' nigga
Upscale type of bitch
Money making like mitch
Got a million dollar pitch
I feel like Randy Johnson
Cook a bitch like Action Bronson
And leave the foreign parked right on Tompkins
You might also like
They call me Blanco
'Cause I like them Tony Montana niggas
Birds in the Phantom
And drop the shit off in Atlanta, nigga
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know

We moving that Blanco, that Blanco (that Blanco)
They wanna be Blanco, I'm Blanco (I'm Blanco)
Baby on my hip, nuevo
Just made a million I need 8 mo'

They call me Blanco
They treat me just like Griselda, nigga
Just call of the plug
Aand tell him that I'ma be at him, nigga
I'm whipping the Wraith
I feel like I'm in space from the roof
I trap out the coupe

Gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gangEmbed
