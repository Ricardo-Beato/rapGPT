3 ContributorsHolding My Breath Lyrics
I kinda feel like a stowaway (Okay)
I'm positive that it's a negative connection
I've got a cup full of Novocaine (Okay)
Stairway to Heaven, hope my name's on the guest list (Go away)
My stress gets trapped between the shoulder blades
Searching for some benefits for perfect attendance
Keep attention span attentive like we dance around an open flame
I'll trade a couple silver linings for some golden days
I confess I'm still trying to impress papa
I guess that I'm expecting I'll see him again, haha
Laughing on a cloud in some wings and a toga
And he's asking why I never left Minnesota
Keep in mind previously thought impossible to find
All of these pieces that were needed to complete the design
I'm on the final lap, then I go back to give my wife a spinal tap
Still writing rhymes like somebody got the time for that

The temperature's rising, but it's colder than Hell
I never feel alone when I'm alone by myself
I try to sing along, but I don't know what you said
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
The temperature's rising, but it's colder than Hell
I never feel alone when I'm alone by myself
I try to sing along, but I don't know what you said
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
You might also like
Tell me, do you ever feel like an accident?
Have you ever felt trapped beneath an avalanche?
Do you ever ask if this experience is seriously happening?
Me neither, I can't imagine it
We gotta pick up the pieces and keep traveling
Or maybe you can handle a hammer and build a ladder and
Explore the storm to find the source of the hunger and the pain
I stole a horse so I could run towards the thunder
And the reins broke and now this beast is my bestie
We used to chain smoke and now we drinking our veggies
We tell the same jokes and pretend that it's okay
Already know what Hell felt like when it's frozen over
Snow-covered roller coaster stuck in the alleyway
Dreaming about the day my poster's up in a gallery
Feel the cold breeze brought me back to reality
I gotta get these groceries back to my family

The temperature's rising, but it's colder than Hell
I never feel alone when I'm alone by myself
I try to sing along, but I don't know what you said
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
The temperature's rising, but it's colder than Hell
I never feel alone when I'm alone by myself
I try to sing along, but I don't know what you said
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath (Okay)
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
And I'm not suffocating, I'm just holding my breath
And I'm not suffocating, I'm justâ€”1Embed
