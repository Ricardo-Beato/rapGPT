44 ContributorsThe Highs & The Lows Lyrics
The highs and the lows
The highs, the lows

I'm an emotional rollercoaster (Ah)
With highs so high, could put Bol Bol on a poster (Mm)
But when the bread get low like four loaves in a toaster
Oh the shoulders can get cold as ten toes in Nova Scotia
Some days I hold a grudge, some days I Holy Ghost her
Some days I just ghost her, some days I'm supposed to
The crib feel like a gunfight, but them strollers, that's the holster (Huh)
We can make amends over old memes and mimosas
My mama know I ain't make my bed, but I'ma lay in it
Whеther it's sandpaper, suedе linen
Whether I'm alone or Creole lady marmalade-ing it
The same pajamas I was afraid in, I boogeyman slayed
My blankets concealed my blade in it, emotional seesaw
With two fat motherfuckers with strong knees in free fall (Huh)
It's cloudy with a chance of meatballs, I checked the weather
I gave all my vices a call, let's get together

To talk about the highs and lows, the ups and downs
The friends that I had to hide to come around
They told me that I knew you'd always come around
Come around, come around, come around, come around
To work out the highs and lows, the ups and downs
No need to hide disguises comin' down
Go and get high, I promise you're comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
You might also like
When it's hard to keep your eyes on the road (Eyes on the road)
And you feel your back's on the ropes (With your backs against the ropes)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (The highs with the lows)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (Yeah, yeah)
You're lost and you're runnin' out of hope (You're runnin' out of hope)
Lookin' for the best way to cope (For the best ways to cope)
Just know we all been there before (We all been there)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (Badmon)

I was feelin' lifeless, I had to cut my vices (I had to)
Now the feelin' that I feel is priceless
In the spirit, want me to be righteous
But I know I might just relapse, get sucked in these devices
Got so used to feedback, I couldn't tell what mines is (Word)
Sometimes all the outside noise just really blinds us
Beware (Facts), believe none of what you see and half of what you hear (Right)
The best things in life on the opposite side of fear
I swear I see it clear, like after the storm
Still, you can't stop the rain like the Loose Ends' song
My word is bond like James, yo, I couldn't complain (Nah)
'Cause even when I did, niggas really couldn't feel my pain (Uh)
That's the type of shit to drive a nigga insane
Wanna be numb, now your thumb back flickin' the flame
Back to square one, tryna overcome what you became
Like they was right, I guess you're never gon' change, I guess you never gon'
When it's hard to keep your eyes on the road (Your eyes on the road)
You start to feel your back on the ropes (Your back 'gainst the ropes)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (The highs with the lows)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (The highs with the lows)
You're lost and you're runnin' out of hope (And you're runnin' out of hope)
And you lookin' for the best way to cope (The best way to cope)
Just know we all been there before (We all been there)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (The highs with the lows)

To talk about the highs and lows, the ups and downs
The friends that I had to hide to come around
They told me that I knew you'd always come around
Come around, come around, come around, come around
To work out the highs and lows, the ups and downs (The ups and downs)
No need to hide disguises comin' down (Comin' down)
Go and get high, I promise you're comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down, comin' down

Buck, buck, buck, brr, Chano
