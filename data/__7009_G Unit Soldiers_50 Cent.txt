17 ContributorsG Unit Soldiers Lyrics
Yea... Yea...Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
Niggas salute me
Uh huh
We takin over this shit
Yo
G Unit!
(Chorus: 50 Cent, Tony Yayo & Both)
G Unit soldiers
Ride out
Whatcha say whatcha say?
G Unit soliders
Ride out

Yea...Yea...
I'm from the hood where the drop-outs is bangin' for the feelin
For houses wit' Tvs hangin' from the ceiling (Lloyd Banks)
We gamble on ball courts
Keep the paint peelin'
You either play ball or rap if you ain't dealin'
I'm stuck in the past
Shit changed since the 80s What!
I know ladies, that got babies wit babies
Out here it's basketball and speedbags
And guns that'll stiffen you up like freeze tag
You might also like
You can talk tough to them cowards that you pick on and beat up
And walk around town wit your whole fuckin re-up (Yayo)
Flashin singles, wit the 20s on top
While I'm ridin on 20s in the chunky drop top
So never show love wit ya left hand
You'll lose 5 liters of blood a thug's a dead man (Come on!)
(Chorus: 50 Cent, Tony Yayo & Both)
G Unit soldiers
Ride out
G Unit soldiers
Ride out
Home of the new right here
G Unit soliders
Ride out
G Unit soliders
Ride out

Nigga...Nigga
Niggas know I'm hot
But my ice cold enough to freeze whole towns (uhh)
Still follow the code Gs up hoes down (come on)
I see you ballin and ya rocks is chilly
Now my G Unit niggas dont ride bikes
Dont pop-a-wheelie (blaaadt)
I ain't straight I'm livin where its hot and sandy
And the Benz's complexion is cotton candy
I bounced up, that's the best part
You niggas don't know what pain is
The only scar on ya body's a stretch mark (stretch mark)
Keep ya mouth shut, and keep ya ears open
Cause it's liver than P-89s when we approachin (what else)
Listen homie
We got AKs and Remingtons
For niggas in the hood playin cowboys and Indians
Ladies and gentleman, we was born to ball
So if you see me in the club I'm in the bathroom stall
Gettin' oral sex she bless the huey all night
She got a gorgeous neck the way she toss this dick
(Chorus: 50 Cent, Tony Yayo & Both)
G Unit soldiers
Ride out
G Unit soldiers
Ride out
50 whatcha sayin??
G Unit soliders
Ride out
G Unit soliders
Ride out
(Outro: Bang Em Smurf)
