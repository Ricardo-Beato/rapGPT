4 ContributorsSecrets Lyrics (Battlecat)
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah
I got to snoop, so cold
Big Snoop (Battlecat, Snoop Dogg)

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep

When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep
I'mma get you before you get me
Them niggas that you hang with are so weak
You're talking shit about me
Turn around and you're the homie
Man that shit is phoney
Tried to set me up bro
But you were singing to my ho


From a nigga to a dub
From a g to a scrub
I'm a vet on the set
I'mma show you what it was
Y'all flipping out, trippin' out
Cause I took a different route
6-2 rag, hell yeah come dippin' out
Beach city rider, 85'er, eastsider
Ain't none of y'all niggas live-er
I hear the bad shit that y'all talk
You want to catch me out of pocket but I can't get caught
I'mma show you what a bitch thought, a bitch taught
A nigga got played out and layed out in chalk
It's a cold game
It's like a rap riddle
Nine times out of ten a bitch was in the middle
Most neighborhoods started off cool
In the eighties it was Long Beach fool
With no seperation
Here's a toast to the real shit, the foundation
You know my game is amazing
I keep blazing
Eastside niggas is the craziest and the shadiest
Yeah dawg, tell 'em again
What you talking 'bout loc?
I got hell of a ends

Hell boss
Hoping that her smiling exes fall (ego hustling loopholes)
I'd always thought that you would've never have stabbed me everywhere

More rumors, more lies
More money, more time
I don't really give a fuck cause you all gon' shine
So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine
I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes
So jealous, so envious
What a drag
Real talk loc, you ain't acting like a man
Your message is how blessed you is
I guess you is
Look at the mess you in


When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep
I'mma get you before you get me
Them niggas that you hang with are so weak
