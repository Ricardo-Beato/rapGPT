Yeah, yeah

Pray out loud, as I pray out loud, sitting (Yeah, yeah)
Days are long and my nights are spent wishing (Hmm, hmm)
So it seems I'm complete, doubt that (Hmm, hmm)
Silent suffering, baby
(Yeah, yeah) Thoughts spin 'round, yeah, these thoughts spin 'round my head
(Yeah, yeah) Thinkin' 'bout all the special things you said
When I sleep, you're what I see, can't shake it
Silent suffering, baby

And they say that I'll heal in time
Maybe so, maybe not
Take it slow and you'll soon be fine
Maybe so, maybe not
And they say that I'll heal in time
Maybe so, maybe not
Take it slow and you'll soon bе fine
Maybe so, maybe not

Sunday aftеrnoon
And I'm dreamin' of you
Please don't go throw your love away
I'm missin' you
You might also like

And they say that I'll heal in time
Maybe so, maybe not
Take it slow and you'll soon be fine
Maybe so, maybe not
And they say that I'll heal in time
Maybe so, maybe not
Take it slow and you'll soon be fine
Maybe so, maybe not3Embed
