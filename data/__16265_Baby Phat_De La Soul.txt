8 ContributorsBaby Phat Lyrics
Fat, fat
Uh
Ain't nothing wrong with big broads
Fat, fat

It's a sure bet
When I stare into your dark browns, I get
Overwhelmed, overjoyed, overstep
My bounds on your touchy subject
Your weight, your shape's not what I date
It's you, my crew don't mind it thick (Uh-uh)
Every woman ain't a video chick (Nah)
Or runway model anorexic
I love what I can hold and grab on
So if you burn it off, then keep the flab on
We gonna stay gettin' our collab on (Ow)
Girl, we gonna stay gettin' our collab on (Ooh, ooh)
We gonna stay gettin' our collab on

Don't get stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryin' to get with you anyway 'cause I know you're a nasty girl
We ain't never gon' discriminate, so let me compliment your size
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You might also like
Yeah, it's nothin' but a little baby fat, fat
It's nothin' but a little baby fat, fat
It's nothin' but a little baby fat, fat
It's nothin' but a little baby fat, fat
Yeah, it's nothin' but a little baby fat, fat

Claim you out of shape, you not out of place (Uh-uh)
You keep it natural with no powdered face
Without exercise, you got the eye
Starin' you down, make me wonder why
You women wanna frown at them stick figures
On them little-ass girls, when a clique of niggas
Run up and try to hurl game for real
Your frame holds appeal in the everyday
World, and conceal is not the way
To go, I'm tellin' you, I had to let
You know, you need to let it all hang

Don't be scared to show a little of that thing-thing
No matter how you weigh it, girl, it's feminine
Kind of body everybody wanna know (Yeah, yeah)
Be the private dancer in my Luke show (Come on, girl)
Skip a salad, girl, bring us both a menu
Eat the whole box of chocolates I send you (Heh)
See, girl, you're more than just an apple in my
Eye, confess I wanna get up in your
Thighs, the rest'll tell you all the things
Don't get stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryin' to get with you anyway 'cause I know you're a nasty girl
We ain't never gon' discriminate, so let me compliment your size
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Fat, fat

I love it when y'all broads wear it skintight (Skintight)
Make the big panties look like little panties
Tryin' to lose that bottom, girl, you been right
I saw who makes your cookies, I should go and thank your granny (Uh-huh)
Don't mind you being conscious of your calories
If gettin pape' was fat, man, you'd be salaries
You ain't in this alone, I got a tummy too
Just let me watch the weight, don't let it trouble you (Come here, girl)
Nine-ten specimen up in your jeans, you buy the size seven and just make it fit
SlimFast, lipo, and body creams, I pray you won't endorse, I got a candle lit

Don't get stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryin' to get with you anyway 'cause I know you're a nasty girl
We ain't never gon' discriminate, so let me compliment your size
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ain't nothin' wrong with big drawers, come here)
Don't get stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryin' to get with you anyway 'cause I know you're a nasty girl
We ain't never gon' discriminate, so let me compliment your size
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, it's nothin' but a little baby fat, fat
It's nothin' but a little baby fat, fat
It's nothin' but a little baby fat, fat
It's nothin' but a little baby fat, fat
Yeah, it's nothin' but a little baby fat, fatEmbed
