26 ContributorsClass President Lyrics
Why thank you, Jerome, that was a very good speech
Next up we have our last candidate for the 2010 Allderdice High School presidential campaign
We have Mac Miller!

Haha, look
Comin' with the flows of a veteran, Mac for class president
All black Letterman, recognize a gentleman
Know anything but formal, take you out the normal
It's time travel here, step into my portal
Never seem to be another ordinary college fellow
Still keep a bunch of action figures, Donatello's
I used to wet my pants, leave the carpet yellow
Now I'm playin' games with hoes, turn they heart to jello
L's rolled from my wrist to my elbow
Hella smoke got my eyes red like Elmo
Music that I make got me buzzin' like a cellphone
Stickin' to my word, I'm Velcro, hell no
I ain't gon' stop one minute
Better than I ever been, before was just a scrimmage
Now the boy playin' for the cup, this the championship
See the wordplay dance from his lips
All my ladies put ya hands on ya hips, here some candy to lick
Come and holla if ya man is a bitch, haha
Every party that I roll to they demand me to spit
Treat me like I'm Peyton Manning in this
Playa, I don't got no time for the slow grind here in '09
Blow minds with these dope rhymes, call 'em coke lines
Snort it, get distorted, I'm takin' you out of orbit
Plus we poppin' champagne, see the cork twist
Purple piff got me higher than a forklift
Hungry, feedin' like my mother got four tits
I'm livin' in this music, you a tourist
Rocky and Bulwinkle, you just Boris
Boy spit still way sharper than a swordfish
Your whole style just dead like a morgue is
I'm a senior but I stay fresh, man
Class president, never woulda guessed, man
Bitches on me that I ain't never met, man
The only thing that's on ya dick is ya left hand
Wolverine nails signin' on the X, man
They don't hear me up in Def Jam

Quite impressive, Mac Miller3Embed
