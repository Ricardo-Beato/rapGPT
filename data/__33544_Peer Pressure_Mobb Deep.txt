18 ContributorsPeer Pressure Lyrics
The pressure... (You gotta find a way to deal with)
You're dealin' with the peer pressure

As a young black teen, everyday I, deal
With the pressure, and mixed up is how I feel
I walk the streets with a 'Fuck you!' attitude
And when it comes to my peoples, you ain't half as rude
Follow the crowd or be a leader, take your pick
Now I'm smokin' buddha Philly blunt style
A frustrated and confused young juvenile
King of the project blues, so I choose
To take a piece of the action
But my sober state of mind won't let it happen
The 24/7 is the number one stresser
Dealin' with the peer pressure


Most don't understand how it is in the world of today
Growin' up as a young black teen
I used to dream, of bein' a architect
Easier said than done, believe me, it's hard to get
Outta the projects, without forgettin' where you came from
My parents told me from day one:
Finish school and avoid all obstacles
But my environment makes it so impossible
For instance, build a strong social life
Without messin' up, still tryin' to live right
Like in junior high, I used to wonder why
Certain females went out with certain guys
You might also like
Then one day, it all dawned on me, yo
You gotta be down, and have it goin' on, see?
I wasn't down with the mainstream, or should I say their team?
Ha! Now I'm gettin' steamed
Gotta find a way to get accepted by my peers
So now I'm sippin' on beers
Buyin' new gear, nuthin' but the best
Forget Levi's, strictly Polo and Guess
But how would I make the cash?
It gotta be easy and it gotta be fast
Thinkin' to myself "Does that make me lesser?"
Just, dealin' with the peer pressure


Around my way, there's a kid that most don't understand
How he lives; is it negative or positive?
He has a grade A average
But when he's on the streets with his friends, he's a savage
A freshman of high school, daily attendant
He never got in trouble, never did he get suspended
Good little Kenny, who would believe?
He dropped out of school and started to smoke weed
I saw the signs, but I didn't pay attention
Because he got offended every time that I would mention
The drinkin', the smokin', the low school grades
And sleepin' in class, laid back with his black shades
Nowadays, you catch Kenny hangin' in the hallways
With his crew, findin' more ways
To break outta school, and hit the block and get buckwild
Stay out of the way of a mad child
'Cause he's a product of hell
Kenny never fell, but he's gonna fall overall
So let's take a trip to the ghetto
Where Kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man, so
He pulled the trigger and the suicide note read:
"I'm glad it's finally over and I'm finally dead
And no more do I have to feel lesser
Or deal with the peer pressure"
