Ha, man, ha, hahaha
(Funkmaster Flex)
Dark
This what we gon' do
When I say go, we gon' go
Huh (Yeah), go

Ready to kick it, give a fuck about a bitch
Was with 'em for a decade, now we off without a hitch
I don't give a fuck if your shit went platinum
You can't fathom how in the fuck I'ma combat 'em
We independent, pick up the mic and I'ma vent it
If I said it, I meant it
Came from the bottom and I sent it
Now I think I'm a good father figure 'cause I was sonnin' rappers before I was a father, go figure
My cryptocurrency is in the seven figures
If you talkin' shit I roll up on you with like elevеn my niggas, ready to come and get us
Fuck with us, it's mе and all my hitters
Made a couple pop songs, made a hundred million, gross
Made a life for myself, for every night I need a toast
I was doing the most, said fuck rap, watch me ghost
I been raising my son, blazing for fun, baskin' in the rays of the sun on my face
Took a step back, damn, I think I finally found my happy place
They say it's not a sprint, I say, "It's not a race"
Comin' up in rap ten years ago, I felt so out of place
Shit was different, if you had beef, you did it face-to-face
Check the pace, yeah, it's fly like drum and bass
I been whippin' that Bronco, bumpin' that "Murder was the Case"
Now I'm givin' it up for the real motherfuckers that love rap, no cap
Retired for a minute, now I'm back, it's Logic

Oh-ha-ha

Ha, now back to that part, that other part, Logic
That part, right here, right here2Embed
