78 ContributorsKush Coma Lyrics
Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down in an elevator at 90 miles an hour
And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
Said, my forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't going make it
Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm tripping, I'm slipping, feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
Said, I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smelling like rose petals
Zoning out, two-three, like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation, kush coma

Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

Get high, my niggas smoke kush
Get fly, my niggas, dope looks
So many numbers in my phone book
I could start a mothafuckin' phone book
Know all the fly bitches gonna look
Like I'm on something, tell 'em roll something
I'm that one nigga bumping 2Pac
Be like three hoes, that's a foursome
Fuck niggas always want to hold something
Young hot nigga done froze on 'em
Went cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em
And clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?
Only fear God, never sold on Him
Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him
Life's a bitch, but she chose on him
Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em
In big shades, fuck the hypocrites, stop
Time let the tats, for the tick, tock
Clocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch
Pause, let it stop, hope we get by
Bye when I zoom, let it vroom
'bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it fuse
A hundred miles an hour on the booth, finna let it loose
A hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms
That's real rap, I'm stating facts
Contradictions, can't take it back
Lil mommy's stripping, make it clap
In a kush coma, finna take a nap (I'm out)
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

Half asleep with that cotton mouth, weed grow house on plantation
Nuggets the size of Rakim rings, got my head looking like a fatality screen
Got my mind dripping, gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way
Knowing goddamn well when the high go away
Same shit gon' be still in my way
I'm a slave to the sticky icky, so nigga roll something with me
Been smoking blunts since high school
Now look at all the bullshit I been through
Wanna pass out, but we stayin up, nigga gotta keep one eye open
Cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn
Nigga roll up, then we starting smoking
I'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos
Sipping on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo
Dipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley
Tell your baby momma sorry, that was one night and please don't call me
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation

Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma39Embed
