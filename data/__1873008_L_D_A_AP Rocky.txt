"Bankroll!" (Go!)

Dope Spot, Sold Out
Water Boiling, Four Pots, Stove Top
Three Rings, Four Chains, Earrings, Blue Watch, Jackpot
Hit the dealer, with my Nigga, Unzip the Zipper
What's that with you?
Hundreds Nigga!
Want a Benz, Want a Beamer, Want a Masi
Want a Rrari, Want a Fisker
Drop-Head, Ranking Stead?, Maybach, Louder Led, Rover Red
9-11, Q7, AA, New Challenger, Coupe Damager
Black Charger, Black Chevelle, Black on Black
Brand New ZL1 as well
New Dually, Super Dually, Diesel Fueling
Shitted on these hoes excuse me
Young Nigga, Never had it, Just Imagined
I'm going to let these Bitches have it
Get it back
Stack it, Add it, Flip it, Match it
Get it with your way the fastest
Need to wrap it, had to have it, Mathematics
Tossit Tratit?, Want a Mansion
Rockstar, Marilyn Manson, Diamonds Dancing
Ballinnn on these Bitches Mannn...

Fucking money up
Couple hundred bucks
Crib a Milli plus
Furniture from Huff's
Man this shit plush
Flat Screen... Touch
Elevated Up
Silver sueded up
Camel cabled up
Counting paper up
Paper counting, got me counting paper cuts
Big Garage, It could fit a fucking bus
Bankroll ballin, he's going to fuck it up
Glass ceiling top peeling, what the fuck
Fuck is up
Mutha Fuck
Duel Master, it's a buck?
Hit the lot, pick a truck
AP glittered up, crystal'd up
Bezeled out, Filled it up, (Filled E'm up)
From the ground, Momma's house, build it up
Magazine, Filled it up
Pusssy Nigga play K, Rip your guts
Nigga What...
Street money
Keep money
Jeep running
Summer Time, skeet something
Two Hoes, and me something
Three Something (Threesome)
Bitch I'm cumming
Peace something...

Ohh He, the one with the racks on right now
Who me
