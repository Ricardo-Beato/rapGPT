I ain't mad at all
Bought a fat jam to make you flip the script
Don't want to sleep and misbehave
I ain't from around here
Understand what I'm saying
I'm all about makin some fat louies
So I can buy my kids
Motorcycles, candybars, Peter Paul
Flavor Flav, he ain't mad at all
Boy
Poppa's got a brand new flav so once
Again here we go
I ain't mad at all
Poppa's got a brand new flav so once
Again here we go
I ain't mad at all
Poppa's got a brand new flav so once
Again here we go
What you know?
Poppa's got a brand new flav so once
Again here we go

What you know bout that, boy?
Noodles, neon noodles
On a fifth chillin with a toy
He's chillin
Thought he had a pit bull
Eating brussel sprouts but he had a big bite
He tried to bite me
He tried to get me
I turned around and I
Hit him with my bike
They picked me up
Put me in a wagon
The bottom fell out and my ass start draggin
Who put the cuffs on Flava
Why you gonna go and do that
He's the Flavor mack
I ain't mad at all
Who put the cuffs on Flava
Why you gonna go and do that
He's the Flavor mack
Yo check out my honey ho's
Sing that shit gee
There's a Flavor Flav
So what your girlie
Before she wanna sneak out early
Cause on the di
Flavor snatched her up
First there was superfly
But Flavor's got more style
And you can't tell because your crackin up
Let me hear you say...
Kick it, Kick it
I ain't mad at all (xg)
I got the feeling I got to tell ya
You be a star
And the man try to jail ya'
I don't pollute
So why should I give a hoot
You ask
Why you livin foul
Na na na na na na
Why they wanna keep me down?
Cause you got Flavor workin day and night
Why you wanna play me
Like fried ice cream
Give me nightmares
Can't never have a nice dream
I feel like bustin' loose
Bustin' loose
Give me a break y'all
You can try to cop my style
But Flavor Flav got too much on file
Boyee
I don't wanna go but I can't stay here no more
I ain't mad at all
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You flatlini'n, you flatlinin' you know what I'm sayin'
Get the cars, kick it
Who put the cuffs Flava
Why you gonna go and do that
Who put the cuffs Flava
I ain't mad at all
Who put the cuffs Flavor Flav
I ain't mad at all... (repeat)1Embed
