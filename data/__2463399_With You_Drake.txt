(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, oh woah
You, woah

Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it (uh)

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, woah
You, woah
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you, woah
You, woah
You might also like
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, woah
You, woah
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, woah
I'm with you, woah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
