Hey, hey, hey
(9th Wonder) Hi, hey, hey, hey
92 'til infinity and beyond (Hey)
And on (I hear it's like—), and on (I hear it's kinda like—)
And on (I hear it's kinda like—), and on (I hear it—)

Hey, I heard they got nice cars up in Heaven
Free liquor out the bar and the brightest fuckin' stars up in Heaven
Heard that you can chill, not worry 'bout the police
Not worry 'bout someone fightin' 'cause everything just at peace
Heard the streets paved with gold, the women all gorgeous
You just float, can't even feel where the floor is
I heard Heaven got a brand new venue
Next to that restaurant, you love their menu
And everything free, so everyone cool
Look out any window, it's an incredible view
Everyone you speak to always tellin' you the truth
And it's only good shit when you gettin' all your news
Ooh, I imagine that
Just a place that we can kick it, be happy at
Satisfaction or maybe I'm dreamin'
Tell you what it's like when I see it

If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go
If you hear what Heaven's like, could you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go
You might also like
I heard ain't nobody famous up in Heaven, everybody the same
Just kick it up there in Heaven 'cause nobody goin' change
Nobody can complain, the parties are all insane
The people all know your name, shit, you entertain
See everybody you want, always keepin' in touch
And go and chill by yourself when everything get too much
Never a fuckin' rush, you there for a million plus
You probably got a Mercedes, but always could take the bus
So fuck, that's what Heaven's like, I guess I think it is
But come to think of it, I've been drinkin' shit, I don't know the truth
This is what I imagined when I was standin' in the booth, haha

If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go
If you hear what Heaven's like, could you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go

Fuck you4Embed
