Act like y'all ain't based your whole shit your whole lifestyle off this nigga Pusha T. Everything is Pusha T. Pyrex vision, that's Pusha T. Fear of God, that's Pusha T. This nigga the heart of the muthafuckin culture, for you culture vultures. This the only nigga spittin that wild muthafuckin hip hop shit, right now. That's why I stand next to this nigga. I don't give a fuck about none of these corporations, none of these fucking sellouts. This is muthafucking Pusha T
This is what the fuck we make. We make good music. We make good music. We don't give a fuck about how much god damn money you make. We make good music. I'm a little ... off that Goose right now. I might get loose right now
We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck! Nigga this is that culture. This is that culture. For everybody stealin the culture. For all the niggas tryna do they camo prints at Magic. This muthafuckin Pusha T. All the niggas tryna extend they t-shirts, tryna throw numbers on the back. This muthafuckin Pusha T
... and I got numbers on the back of my shit - FUCK YOU! This DONDA. This Matt Williams. This Virgil Abloh. This Ferris Bueller. This muthafuckin Pusha TYou might also like15Embed
