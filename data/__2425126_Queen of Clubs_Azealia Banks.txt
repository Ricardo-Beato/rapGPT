21 ContributorsQueen of Clubs Lyrics
Come on DJ, spin for me
You play that beat, I'll rock my body
I can freak the dance floor
I can work that thing all over shawty
I'll leave you my number
If you want me, baby, you can call me
Turn the fuckin' heat up
DJ play that beat, I wanna party

She was dealt the queen of clubs
So tell the fuckin' DJ to play my favorite song
I don't need the champagne, B, I'm blazin' up
Wanna put my hands up in the air
Yo come on
You know this was the life I was born to live
Queen of the club
Can't you see that the nighttime belongs to me
Up every night and every day

Come on DJ, spin for me
You play that beat, I'll rock my body
I can freak the dance floor
I can work that thing all over shawty
I'll leave you my number
If you want me, baby, you can call me
Turn the fuckin' heat up
DJ play that beat, I wanna party
You might also like
Every time I step in the club, it's a problem, it's crazy
Everything on deck, I got Ace, I got Spades, I got drugs
I don't fuck with jokers, you bitch niggas never could play me
I just rock my heart on my pendant, the diamonds is froze
Chuckin' up the deuces, the bitches, they knew that I'm shady
They don't like me either, but fuck it, them bitches is bust
All my suits designer, Prada, Proenza, Versace
Give me that Givenchy, I'm thuggin' it up

She was dealt the queen of clubs
So tell the fuckin' DJ to play my favorite song
I don't need the champagne, B, I'm blazin' up
Wanna put my hands up in the air
Yo come on
You know this was the life I was born to live
Queen of the club
Can't you see that the nighttime belongs to me
Up every night and every day

Come on DJ, spin for me
You play that beat, I'll rock my body
I can freak the dance floor
I can work that thing all over shawty
I'll leave you my number
If you want me, baby, you can call me
Turn the fuckin' heat up
DJ play that beat, I wanna party
Every time I step in the club, it's a problem, it's crazy
Everything on deck, I got Ace, I got Spades, I got drugs
I don't fuck with jokers, you bitch niggas never could play me
I just rock my heart on my pendant, the diamonds is froze
Chuckin' up the deuces, the bitches, they knew that I'm shady
They don't like me either, but fuck it, them bitches is bust
All my shoes designer, Prada, Proenza, Versace
Give me that Givenchy, I'm thuggin' it up

She was dealt the queen of clubs
So tell the fuckin' DJ to play my favorite song
I don't need the champagne, B, I'm blazin' up
Wanna put my hands up in the air
Yo come on
You know this was the life I was born to live
Queen of the club
Can't you see that the nighttime belongs to me
Up every night and every day7Embed
