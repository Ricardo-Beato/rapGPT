30 ContributorsHustle Harder Lyrics
Black and blue outside her soul
Carries a heart of gold
Her misconception 'bout what love is, she passes on
The child she brings in to the world don't know
Right from wrong
Her soul is sore, she deserves more

Red lipstick bo', French press col'
You know she queen bee by the way she wear her gold
Honey gettin' money the ass is stupid
She far from a dummy funny I thought she came from money how she makin' money
At the club going hard like liquor
Shots of Ciroc she can out drink a nigga
Niggas dig her think they can take her to the crib and break her mover her shake her you can't fake her
She knows time is paper
Glaciers on her neck-uh
Pleasures on her finger
Gucci purse carry notes like a singer uh uh
Go to the steam room and she carry a steamer
Beamer, Benz, she got friends in high ends
She know trend she know when
She go in like an investor
Yes sir, never getting gassed like a Tesla
Ain't about all that extra
Destiny brought her to where niggas bought her, a lot of shit
She ain't caught up bitches taught her to hustle
Hustle harder than a nigga

(Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (True)
She hustle harder than a nigga (Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)

She bad, uh uh, she bad
Don't complain about it but she let you know when she on that rag
Swag like Angelina or more like Angela Bassett
Many aspects emphasis sophisticated and ratchet
She fasted for a week that's stronger than most
If she had kids she could mother father them both
Prominent host throw a party and she know everybody
Devil in a tight dress something that is golly
She know what niggas want she know how to make 'em hunt
Hotel suite at the Trump
The way she walk in them pumps
Talkin' 'bout takin' over the world while holding a blunt
She hold her man down when her man get locked up
Prada keep movin' she movin' and shake it like Parkinson's
Used to seel hot purses and network marketing
Eye shadow darker than them dudes she like
An actress her life is so movie like
She hustle harder than a nigga
(Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (True)
She hustle harder than a nigga (Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)

Uh, Dreezy
Look
I be livin' like I need a Lamborghini
I make it happen I would never need a genie
Went and got zucchini
Threw away that fettuccine
I been going to the gym I'm tryna get in that bikini
I'ma, smart chick but I never went to Harvard
I'm like a Nina got designer for my armor
Lookin' for a presidential nigga like Barbara
I'm harder, at these niggas heads like a Barber
This is for my ladies whose single but got a baby
Who Probably driving a Honda but saving for that Mercedes
This is for my pretty women that know that they independent
You say that her shit is rented she probably get offended, man
The new kid like a transfer
I'm known to set trends let them copy like the answers
I could be a lady in the streets but in the booth I pull triggers
Shots fired I got harder than a, nigga
Afternoon, breezy afternoon too, the winds out west at fourteenth gusting at 22 O'Hare
High today 62, maybe some rain tonight, a low of 40 degrees
60 at O'Hare midway 61, the lakefront at 60 and Wheeling sunny at 606Embed
