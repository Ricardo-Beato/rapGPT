77 ContributorsKing Nas Lyrics
Ghetto, uh, uh
Ghetto, ghetto (yeah)
Ghetto (uh) ghetto

Ghetto mythologies colonize my mind constantly
To shine sonically in the Chi, Divine Comedy
I vibe consciously to override suicide inside
Honestly 'cause they don't wanna honor me and honesty
Black king poetic with Nat King's aesthetic
Half-dream, half-machine where the black queens get naked
For a dollar from a scholar like me
Not at all bothered with what a sodomite see, flippant
A thousand grams get dissolved in the kitchen
Heart wrenchin', part played, took away from my ascension
Crooked ways brought from car lookaways from tooken Js
But it's too late for your prevention 'cause I'm playin' my position

I'm the man now
I'm the man, now
I'm the man, now
If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now
Not the man then keep your motherfuckin' hands down
Man now
I'm the man, now
You might also like
Uh, killer friends, dope dealers concealing sins
Sin and swim in my trunk like jumps in deeper ends
We the gems, your daughter, we'll teach her hymns
From the annals of crime channels that dismantle her wants for weaker men
Send 'em back, a livin', I'm feelin' trapped
We no religion but brimmin' with brilliant facts
So we map cast distorted role of a lady
With no control, let her go whole on a baby
I wanna see it all, never half asleep some niggas can't see the walls
'Cause of the masterpiece my data breach like hacker leaks
Delete the McAfees and slam the backdoors in back of me
Social engineer, peers stare at it, give a chat to me happily
Actually activated off accolades of my apogee
And act yakkity then deeply speak it back to me
Then move it further, we can have a junta or a jerga
I smurf it and spoof the server, reboot and produce a cursor

I'm a man now
I'm the man, now
I'm the man, now
If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now
Not the man then keep your motherfuckin' hands down
Man now (ghetto, ghetto)
I'm the man, now
Deny the service and a little blue from the boycott
Advertise rum, space available on my toy box
But no sleepin' on me, dig deeper than reachin' shorties
Scheme for giant green, getting CREAM sweeter than bein' corny
Know the difference between bein' in love and bein' horny
Bein' hated, bein' human, bein' a teen but bein' forty
They like to get 'em young like I'm Brigham's son
Be more man and my attitude' no lad, I'd rather have a youth
Flag the OGs pullin' Benzos out
They make 'em put they pussies out like Fred Flintstone's house
Heart blacker than the back of Fred Flintstone mouth
Or maybe more like Baba Kwesi, take the TEMBO route
To be

A man now
I'm the man, now
I'm the man, now
If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now
Not the man then keep your motherfuckin' hands down
Man now (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
I'm the man, now

From the ghetto, ohh
Qul a'uudhi bi rabbin naas
Malikin naas, Ilaahin naas
Min sharril wawaasil khannas
Alladhee yuwaswisu fee suduurin naas
Minal Jinnati wa naas
Ghetto
From the ghetto
Ghetto (ghetto, ghetto)
From the ghetto
Ghetto (ghetto, ghetto)
Not goin' down to the ghetto, the ghetto
When we gon' bring back God to the ghetto?
You're the man, now, yeah, yeah
You're the man, now
You are, the man now
You the man
You're the man, now (now, now)
Huh, whatcha lookin' at?
Huh, whatchu lookin at?
Huh, whatchu lookin at?3Embed
