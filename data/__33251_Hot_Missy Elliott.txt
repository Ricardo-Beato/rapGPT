6 ContributorsHot Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh (Yeah), huh
(Uh) This is (Uh) an old school (Uh) Missy exclusive (Huh)
Look

I ain't on no ra-ra shit (Uh)
You don't wanna test how far Miss get (Ooh)
Me and Timothy cars got kits
But we don't drive around tryna prove you shit (Uh)
Everyone tryna be that bitch
But there can only be one bitch make hits (Oh)
I know I must make y'all sick
'Cause after I spit, you beg to quit (Ooh)
I used to drive a six
And then I bought a Murci√©lago to sit (Ooh)
On the plush leather seats, forget
Am I on my own clit? Yes, I must admit (Yeah)
M-I-S is it
Misdemeanor, have you seen her?  I'm the best it get (Come on)
And those who try to test this chick (Uh)
Where they at right now? In peace, resting in (Uh)

If you broke, just say you broke
'Cause all you blowin' up, your ass is some smoke (Uh-huh)
'Cause rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum, broke nigga, that's for sure (Uh-huh)
I know you broke, just say you broke (Ooh)
'Cause all you blowin' up, your ass is some smoke (Uh)
'Cause rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum, broke liar, that's for sure (For sure)
You might also like
Yeah, boo, you know you a joke
Wear a fake Rolex, call it a Ro (Ooh)
Act like you're down with so and so
You're whack on wax, 'bows I came to throw (Uh)
I might just let you mop my floor
For my autograph, take this flick to go, cheese
Miss don't say no more
'Cause you know what I do and you know what I know (Oh)
And I don't think so
You don't wanna lose a arm or elbow (Ooh)
If you're broke, then just say so
'Cause the Bentley that you're rentin', yo, it's got to go (Ah)
Back to the Black man store
Along with your weave, cop a new afro (Uh)
Why you wanna make Miss stoop so low?
But if you try to test me, I just check you slow (Come on)

If you broke, just say you broke
'Cause all you blowin' up, your ass is some smoke (Uh-huh)
'Cause rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum, broke nigga, that's for sure (Uh-huh)
I know you broke, just say you broke (Ooh)
'Cause all you blowin' up, your ass is some smoke (Uh)
'Cause rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum, broke liar, that's for sure (For sure)
In old school, we used to call out names (Ooh)
But I ain't tryna give you no fame (Uh)
My credit card gon' bring ya pain (Yeah)
To know your account just hold change (Ooh)
No need to wreck your brains (Oh)
Tryna see who Missy gon' slain (Uh)
I roll solo, not with a gang (Uh)
I don't carry guns, kick ass with a chain (Yeah)
Don't let me say it again
I don't carry guns, kick ass with a chain (What's up?)
Like a Chinese man (Reverse it, ti esrever)
Know what I'm saying? (Ooh)

If you broke, just say you broke
'Cause all you blowin' up, your ass is some smoke (Uh-huh)
'Cause rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum, broke nigga, that's for sure (Uh-huh)
I know you broke, just say you broke (Ooh)
'Cause all you blowin' up, your ass is some smoke (Uh)
'Cause rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum, broke liar, that's for sure (For sure)

Dear Lord Almighty, I know when it's our time to go, it's our time to go
But when You come to carry us home, do we not be entertainers anymore?
Do we just rest in peace or do we go back to see our family's pain?
Do we not remember Hell on Earth'll come back as a new person again?
I ask these questions, will Aaliyah, Lisa, Tupac, Big Pun be our newest generation?
Because if so, like a Michael Jackson release, the whole world is anticipatin'
To see these fallen soldiers come back and get the crown they deserve
For givin' us great music and great music that will always be heard
We love youEmbed
