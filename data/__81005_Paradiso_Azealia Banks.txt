21 ContributorsParadiso Lyrics
You can sun if you want to
Fun if you want to
Stay in the shade all day if you kunt too
Villa with shore view, 'punzle I adore you
Bitches rock whatever she say they can afford too
What'chu know about going out key west?
Relax, recess, all up on the beach, yes
Feet sandy, look at little bambi in the two piece set looking like a banjee
Can we kick it in the Hamptons?
Residing where it's fancy
Quart of Pino or the champagne
She a leader and a champion
Coco dream things, aqua green scenes
Palm trees caribbean queen
A paradise with me is so amazing
So elevating, sit up on the beat and singYou might also like5Embed
