11 ContributorsSolar Midnite Lyrics
Simplified love-sick, taking no prisoners
Sunny day, cold heart, listen up listeners
Dark side love affair out of time and in the rush
You can't hold it until the sun rise settin up
Let's levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes
Everything you're hiding
I can see the truth in you
Even when you're lying, even through the darkness
I can see you shining

When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you

Blood, By, Sun, Light (Blood, By, Sun)

A played out love song playing in the background
Seems to describe every part of where were at now
Every feeling that we ever had for each other
Every karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered
Now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin' but some trouble
Now some couple trouble makers making mayhem on the double
Tryna figure out the meaning and break apart the puzzles
Why they love you when I hate you when they hate the way I love you, solar
You might also like
When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you
When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you

Blood, By, Sun, Light
Blood, By, Sun, Light (Come on!)
Blood, By, Sun, Light

A complicated heartbreak losing its direction
Cold day, warm heart--object of affection
My dark side love affair come to my protection
Midnight's on the way I'm losing my connection
Levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes, I know that you?re hiding
I can see the truth in you even I know that you're lying
Throw away the darkness, I wanna see you shining

When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you
When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you
When it's midnight and it's colder (Blood, By)
Pull you closer I can see you through (Sun, Light)
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you
When it's midnight and it's colder (Blood, By)
Pull you closer I can see you through (Sun, Light)
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and youEmbed
