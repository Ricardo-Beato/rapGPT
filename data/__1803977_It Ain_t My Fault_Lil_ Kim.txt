3 ContributorsIt Ainâ€™t My Fault Lyrics
Lil Kim that's more than a lil bit
Tell a nigga quit
Go 'head wit' ya lil dick
Wit' ya lil money, lil ice, and ya lil whip
You already know I'm in love with that big shit
You an imitation, I'm that real shit
Y'all just playin the greatest like Will Smith
I kill 'em with kindness, blow a lil kiss
Look like you gotta weak bladder, you a lil pissed
Uh, but it ain't my fault, the queen never left
I don't know what y'all thought
Right back to ballin'
Gettin' money is sport
And i always tell the truth even when I'm in court
New York, it ain't New York
Go on show off, drop the top on that Porsche
If everyday ya hustlin' like Rick Ross
Then you get it like a boss
No matter what it cost
Lil Kim that's more than a lil bit
Tell a nigga quit
Go 'head wit' ya lil dick
Wit' ya lil money, lil ice, and ya lil whip
You already know I'm in love with that big shit
But it ain't my fault, the queen never left
I don't know what y'all thought
Right back to ballin'
Gettin' money is sport
And i always tell the truth even when I'm in court
You might also likeA lot of rappers act big with they lil hit
They overdoin' it more than a lil bit
Impress me, take more than a lil chips
Big things poppin' go 'head with that lil shit
Uh, I'm throwin' money in the crowd
The way I make it rain
Make ya fuck around and drown
Now them leaches ain't around
I'm better off alone
Got rid of the dead weight, like Star Jones
Sleepin on Kim
Y'all better wake up
I'm shinin' on y'all like I just opened the drapes up
Wishin' on a star but ya never get lucky
Me and Sha Money gotta rap like a mummy

ShaMoney gets more than a lil dome
Quick to tell a bitch go and kick it like a field goal
Even though you got the kind of body niggas kill for
As I think about it, damn i hate to see you go
I tell you from the start you gotta know your part
You can't miss me at night, I glow in the dark
Look baby, I'm a rockstar, no guitar
Young, fly nigga shades on like Bret Hart
ShaMoney gets more than a lil dome
Quick to tell a bitch go and kick it like a field goal
I don't need a super woman, I just need a lil more
Lil cris, lil haze, and a lil dro
And I'm cooler than an A/C breeze
Still stomp a nigga out in my ACGs
Still run up in ya crib through that ADT
ASAP where that money at
If I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'ma go and get that duffle bag
I ain't never ran from a nigga, I ain't a runnin' back
Mike Vick ya dog, ya better muzzle that
Dang nigga, you soak a nigga like a bubble bath
You don't want none of that
We be on that bullshit
Still gettin' money man I'm good like I'm hood rich
Walk around on that "wish a nigga would" shit
Me and Queen Bee need more than a lil bit
Lil Kim that's more than a lil bit
Tell a nigga quit
Go 'head wit' ya lil dick
Wit' ya lil money, lil ice, and ya lil whip
You already know I'm in love with that big shit
But it ain't my fault, the queen never left
I don't know what y'all thought
Right back to ballin'
Gettin' money is sport
And i always tell the truth even when I'm in court

ShaMoney gets more than a lil dome
Quick to tell a bitch go and kick it like a field goal
Even though you got the kind of body niggas kill for
As I think about it, damn i hate to see you go
I tell you from the start you gotta know your part
You can't miss me at night, I glow in the dark
Look baby, I'm a rockstar, no guitar
Young, fly nigga shades on like Bret HartEmbed
