5 ContributorsSnapple Lyrics
Whoo!
Some niggas want to kill me I don't care if y'all feel me I'm a motherfuckin rider
A hundred teeth bites to your 23 strikes Ima mothafuckin tiger
I used to grip hammers now I carry Nick Cannons like I wanna fuck Mariah
Your talkin bout bands but your hoppin out the van yous a motherfuckin liar
Trappin on the block with a choppa in the car but I never got caught
You heard all about me couple niggas try to out me but they never got far
Shares to the dre's couple shots to the face and the rest is all yours
Don't smile at my face with your drills at your face like a nigga Paul Walsh
Got shooters and them niggas all talk
Jail posed with a cellphone and my niggas all call
Few problems that I'm never gon solve
Couple bad bitches with some kids so I never go raw swear to God that I never go hard
Drunk sex on a rollercoaster bitch you better hold on and my Cadillac really so soft
Shit Ima die in the booth till the heavens gon call

Who the fuck you think you fuckin with I'm Joyner?
Trappin inna corner gettin high but I ain't have no marijuana
Make a nigga wanna die from paranoia
Take your body dig a hole big enough to put a tractor on you, nigga drownin and ain't gettin out the water
Double sided penny flippin dimes time to get a half a quarter
I don't even think you need to have a lawyer
Order in the court I'm the judge bitch you gettin outta order
Motherfucka!

And I ain't finna show you where the drugs at, fuck rap
I ain't give a fuck about a crush back, trust that
Pull my dick out and just make her suck that, bust that
Hoes that who see me give you a nut bath, scrub that
Feel like I'm ready to go above cats, up that
Over your rims and under your hubcaps, puff that
Smokin some shit that get you a come bat' scumbag
Imma submit em sick of them dumb rats
Yeah I'm finna show you where the loves at, fuck rap
I ain't give a fuck about a dumb stack, trust that
Gucci and Fendi and where the sun's at, bust that
Shit that you speakin and give you a bloodbath, scrub that
I'm more than ready to go above cats, up that
Over your head and under your suncaps, puff that
Spit at and kick you niggas and punt that like, like *spit*
Don't your hear the drums hittin on the 808
I used to get a couple bitches that'd pay to play
Never really had shit but I mad a way- and all I gave em was some hard dick and some gatorade
Pussy young and I'm doin what I had to do
Back when I was just a nigga with an attitude
Grandma told me rap music ain't an avenue so I went hard and now I'm flyin like a parachute
Joyner Lucas give a million with the man ho
Workin so hard I forgot to change clothes
Kickas hella soft rappers with the same flow, and all there fuckin heads cotton candy and some rainbows
Hold up, who you think you is?
Imma go hard no matter who you say you is
I ain't for the small talk big can put the strap and I'm to busy for distractions don't be asking me no questions nigga mind yo fuckin business
They askin me questions, like
Are you Joyner? From paranoia?
Put a tractor, nih (Oh Shit)
Niggas drownin and ain't gettin out the water tryna, tryna get to have a quarter
I don't even think you really have a lawyer
Order in the court I'm the judge bitch you gettin out of order

Who the fuck you think you fuckin with I'm Joyner?
Trappin in the corner gettin high but I ain't have no marijuana
Make a nigga wanna die from paranoia
Take your body dig a hole big enough to put a tractor on you
Nigga drownin and ain't gettin out the water
Double sided penny flippin dimes time to get a half a quarter
I don't even think you need to have a lawyer
Order in the court I'm the judge bitch you gettin out of order Motherfucka!Embed
