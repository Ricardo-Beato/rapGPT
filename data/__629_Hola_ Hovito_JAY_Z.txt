83 ContributorsHola’ Hovito Lyrics
J (Uh), A (Uh-uh), Y (Uh-uh-uh)
This that hop I'm talkin' 'bout right here, Timbo
I can't be stopped when it hop like this, family, uh
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

They say, "Hola, Hovito"
That's what they sayin' when I roll up with my people
My music bangin' like vatos locos, got rap in a chokehold
And I won't surrender it with beats by Timbaland
Cállate la boca, my baby
All I want to do is stroke you all crazy
My dick game is vicious, insane at bitches
Mami keep comin' back 'cause mami came vicious
Catch Hov in the drop, nasty thang, lane switchin'
Once you turn your neck for a sec, your dame's missin'
Bujando, bujando, the cops is comin'
Got that rap patrol behind, yo, get to runnin'
I'm unstoppable Hov, untoppable flows
I'm the compadre, the Sinatra of my day
Ol' Blue Eyes, my nigga, I did it my way
Y'all not rollin' with Hov, then hit the highway

Hola, Hovito (Yeah, yeah)
Hola, Hovito
Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Put it down for my people
Hola, Hovito
Hola, Hovito
Yeah, yeah, that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Put it down for my people
You might also like
Yeah, yeah
Naw, I don't fuck around, stay on my J-O
Hov been about that dough since I was a day old
Oh, push perico if I need to for the root of evil
Was born in the belly, that's the way the streets breed you
One life to live, notice you get no sequel
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
Six, ooh-wee, jewels drippin', big tooly
I ball for real, y'all niggas is Sam Bowie
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick
MJ, him Jay, fadeaway perfect
I rhyme sicker than every rhyme spitter
Every crime nigga that rhyme or touch a mic, because my mind's quicker
I'm a '88er, nine-six a reasonable doubt
Temper short, don't take much to squeeze you out
Yeah, you shinin', but the only thing you're leavin' out
You're a candle in the sun, that shit don't even out

Hola, Hovito (Yeah, yeah)
Hola, Hovito (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Put it down for my people
Hola, Hovito
Hola, Hovito
Yeah, that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Put it down for my people
Hold up, naw, motherfuckers
Y'all motherfuckers better run to the post office and get a job, motherfuckers
Or starve, motherfuckers
'Cause Jay's been the only one eatin' thus far, subpar motherfuckers
Naw, even though y'all hate, I love y'all motherfuckers
Friend or foe, y'all all my motherfuckers
If you haven't heard, I'm Michael, Magic, and Bird
All rolled in one
'Cause none got more flows than Young
Plus got more flows to come
And if I ain't better than Big, I'm the closest one
So move over, hoes, choose Hova
My food for thought so hot, it give you dudes ulcers
Rovers, roasters, hoes is
Gettin' it in with me, livin' like they supposed to
Watches, chain, front row at the game
Sold-out arena, all screamin' my name, c'mon

Hola, Hovito (Yeah, yeah)
Hola, Hovito
Yeah, that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Put it down for my people
Hola, Hovito
Hola, Hovito
Yeah, yeah, that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Put it down for my people19Embed
