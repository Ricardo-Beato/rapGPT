10 ContributorsHurry Lyrics
I know y'all been waiting on the album
Lotta mixtapes
Ya know, lotta thangs
BURR!

Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci
Gucci got a warrant, how the fuck I get subpoenaed?
Objection! What's the objection?
Your honor, I'm a genius
13 years old, got my Jordan's in the cleaners
Like Lil Scrappy rockin FILAs
In the club, Sho Nuff like Tela (Gucci!)
Black and white chain in the Libra like a zebra
This is not your everyday ordinary fucking Beemer
This is no part of the seven, it's a moss, it cost a mean one
Got my top back for my grandma, got my beater for Aaliyah
It's me and my money and my diamonds, we a trio
And no disrespect to Ne-Yo but it's Gucci Mane I'm Sosa
And my albino Testarossa bout the color of the ocean
It's Gucci Mane La Flare and my bank account is rollin
Is you rollin?

Pounds came Thursday
Two days early
Plug showin' love, so my niggas count lovely
12 don't discourage me, robbers don't worry me
My plug showing love, so it's gone in a hurry
Yeah, it's gone in a hurry
Push the white powder, same color as my jewelry (well damn)
Yeah, it's gone in a hurry
Plug showin' love, man, 12 don't discourage me
You might also like
911 emergency, Gucci making currency
Somebody call an ambulance, I think my flow's been burglary
District has been murderin'
Who you calling murderer
The only thing I'm killing is yo motherfuckin' girl's jaw
Smoking on that fruity dro
Girl, you look like Keyshia Cole
I know you a dick pulla
But can't fuck you Blood Raw
Damn, I like them kinky flows
28, I'm young bitch
All white diamonds, VVS white diamond bricks
Get back boy, ole national
Two unrational hood hoez
Two deuces with two koolist
It's gucci gucci gucci stupid
285 I hu-la hoop it
'08 coupe without the roof
Told the dealer he can keep it
He can keep it, I don't need it

Pounds came Thursday
Two days early
Plug showin' love, so my niggas count lovely
12 don't discourage me, robbers don't worry me
My plug showing love, so it's gone in a hurry
Yeah, it's gone in a hurry
Push the white powder, same color as my jewelry (well damn)
Yeah, it's gone in a hurry
Plug showin' love, man, 12's don't discourage me
Back like I never left
Left like I never slept
Check out the stupid check
, gimme that
Yeah, I so so def to that
Trap niggas, they gimme that
You ain't got no money cat
So Icey, the millionaires
I feel like a trillionaire
Drink some bleach and kill ya self
We got kush and purp to spare
Crazy, crazy, crazy, rims
Sat my 'vette on stupid shit
Sat my Hummer, 30 inch
Dually truck, paint burgundy
Cell phone cost 100 now
I get so much money now
I make so much money now
Still the junkies wipe me down
Cell phone cost 100 now
I get so much money now
I make so much money now
Still the junkies wipe me down
Pounds came Thursday
Two days early
Plug showin' love, so my niggas count lovely
12 don't discourage me, robbers don't worry me
My plug showing love, so it's gone in a hurry
Yeah, it's gone in a hurry
Push the white powder, same color as my jewelry (well damn)
Yeah, it's gone in a hurry
Plug showin' love, man, 12's don't discourage me2Embed
