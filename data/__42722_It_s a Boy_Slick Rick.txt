4 ContributorsIt’s a Boy Lyrics
It's me at last, the Rickster, Def Jam's where I be at
And most agree it’s kinda amazing folks are born from where we pee at
Though I definitely fiend it, baby no way, chills, clever mean it being
Got to be careful (…be told), commercial ever seen it?
Want a few hot ropes, some ask am I cheatin’, do I? Nope
Not a dope, love the mother, also loves me too I hope
So I dig her a lot and although shorty honey break a nigga
How you figure? Bein’ a big rap money makin’ nigga
Cute as a button, he tell ’bout the time we picked for cotton
So it ain’t forgotten, hope I don’t spoil the nigga rotten
Also, don’t discriminate white, he’ll be quite bright, if taught him right
If not he like ask heavenly father, help me raise my shorty right
So when I come home with the coil, I say “yo shorty run to royal”
Seein’ as I’m loyal and livin’ on soil, it’s best when you have someone to spoil
So any toy, he wants he gets, yo kids ain’t worth it midst the toys
That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it’s a boy

Picture friends, milk and cookies, when you’re done with the boy’s game
Toy plane, Ricky Jr. being the bundle of joy’s name
And furthermore teach birds and bees
So won’t be a nerd and burst herds of, second and thirds of
And “Dada” better be the first words of
Just kiddin’, son’ll be  a one man girl, spend a lot on what I be wearin’
Best of care, best that money can buy is what he’ll be wearin’
With these weathers around, protect him, they’ll say in a cage I kept him
Though wage you kindergarten probably be another major step and
Lo and behold a star holdin’, ‘cause yo be loadin’ trips and sowin’
Ya knowin’? Throw in a fancy home for him to grow in
“He’s kinda pleasin’ to raise"… so baby say. No thank you… ease in
Sneezin’, now what do I do when he cry for no reason?
Though any toy, he want he get, yo kids it ain’t worth it, midst the toys
That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it’s a boy, yo

Baby mom, under wing, though if dress up, could string
Line of cuties, though cling, don’t wanna mess up a good thing
You know how it is when guys that pay girls seem to hog us
Fiend and dog us, scheme for more guts
Goin' into labor date, 18 of August
It’s that time tellin’ friends, congratulate’s yellin’
Gonna be six weeks premature, but thanks to God, he’s doin’ well
And givin’ credit where it is due, while rap’s achievin’ let it
As for bills forget it, ’cause the way I rap, don’t even sweat it
My own when me and my hon son, don’t fuss, agree
Though son, I still kinda wish I coulda been there when he was born at 3:01
Bygone be gone, there’s nowhere wrong and all
Your son’s about and since I didn’t and this being the first
You know I had to write a rap about the incident
And the rose is for the squeeze, I would’ve sent a few no women with the kin in it
Wish us luck, world, as we enter a new beginning
And like I said, any toy, I’m tryin’ to tell ya that midst the toys
That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it’s a boyEmbed
