Uh-uh, dude
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Lights flicker for the mighty rager nigga (I like)
When the girlies lookin', please don't ask for pictures (It's a)
Mission every day, just livin' out some scriptures (We here)
We forever (Know that), I won't miss you (Uh-uh)
Turn it loud, it don't matter when and how (It's cool)
I feel I graduated, time I take a bow (Salute)
New adventures, we escapin' with the crew (As we do)
Get all in it (Aha), no more slackin' (Be a beast)

(Mmm-hmm)
This life goes on and on, yeah (Mmm-hmm)
Livin' my truth is all I know, yeah (Mmm-hmm)
In this life, it goes on and on, yeah (Mmm-hmm)
Livin' my truth, livin' with— (Love)

True story is the chapter of the chosen (We are)
Hands high, feelin' right, I'm Rosie golden (We off)
To new experiences, memories I'm holdin' (Feel like)
I'm a winner (Uh-huh), never losin' (Nah-uh)
I remember like my mama used to tell me (You can)
Do anythin', no matter what they tell me (Papa)
He'd be proud, he'd be smilin' from the clouds (No doubt)
Got my angels (And God), on my job (To the moon)
You might also like
(Mmm-hmm)
This life goes on and on, yeah (Mmm-hmm)
Livin' my truth is all I know, yeah (Mmm-hmm)
In this life, it goes on and on, yeah (Mmm-hmm)
Livin' my truth, livin' with— (Love)Embed
