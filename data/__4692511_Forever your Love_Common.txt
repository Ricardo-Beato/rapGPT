9 ContributorsForever your Love Lyrics
When the day breaks, I display grace
Through infinite takes, and heartbreaks
The ground shakes, talks around race
Through birth quakes, I keep my crown straight
And bow face to you, it's salutations
I hold you high, you brought me in creation
You were patient with me dribblin' in the basement
And said, "Where's your common sense, boo? Don't waste it"
The pain that you had, it was hard to place it
For my dad, I couldn't be a replacement
I yearn for plates with catfish and collard greens
You got me into school, off of Mama schemes
I know I can lean, on you for anything
Ain't have to want for nothing, you my everything
They say we don't get to choose our mothers
Somehow I know our souls chose each other

Saint something, please protect this family
Give cover, from the world's insanities
I know you got a lot on your plate
The stress is on a lot of your faith
And no matter what's coming
I will be there, I will be there
You might also like
Jesus walked across my lawn
And told me you the mom I'm supposed to have
Nobody in my life is as close as that
If I'ma write you a song ain't no holdin' back
Now, I wasn't raised in no cul-de-sac
You said, "Stay in school," 'cause you ain't know I rap
Teachin' me in moments I ain't know was class
That's why every girl I go home with be showin' class
When I show my ass, you gave me a whippin'
The paradigm shifted and parentin' is different
Black woman strength in search of vulnerability
You did everything you could and did it willingly
Instilled in me values of what a child do
To say you my Ma, I'm ever so proud to
You wrote me letters to get myself better
I still cherish when we pray together
That's a time I really feel the Lord
I thank you for the your declarations and your vision board
It hit a chord, when they rolled you into surgery
Mama, you the sky and earth to me

Saint something, please protect this family
Give cover, from the world's insanities
I know you got a lot on your plate
The stress is on a lot of your faith
And no matter what's coming
I will be there, I will be there
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Oh-oh)
Ah, ah, oh, oh, ah, ah (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
