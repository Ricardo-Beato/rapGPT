14 ContributorsCan I Be Lyrics
Yeah, Yeah Yeah, E..

I'm often often, sittin' in my world in the coffin, coughin off the herb of the curb
Money, money, money is what they concur
Do they Agree? what they might see, could be
Not exactly what they thought
The car the rap star allgededly bought is probly the same car that the rap star rented
Front end in tennis, supreme in the snowfish
Tailin' the whip, parkin lot a double piece, parked then
My mom swore that I'd be the next come up
Them otha niggas far from it
Can't stand how these dick rock bandits even get granted the access
All up in the mix
Wanna be a Kanye
Wanna be a Skateboard P, but nigga
All the BBC cannot put you, in the same place or give you the same face
Find you first and you couldn't raise the stakes, higher
Not talkin shit just fire, please muthafucka
All this BAPE shit I rock is none otha
Who the best MC's in the Cleve?
Cas, Chip, da Cudder, triple da illness
And Ohio gotta feel this
Took a decade just to say I'm paid
Took a took a decade just to get girls to lay down, spread eagle, pop dat pussy ho'
Need the love below I'm the champ that needs a gold medal
Styles of flow homeboy, I got plenty
I payed for my noodle, the digital vortex. Textin' a freak
Digital phone sex
She wanna suck a dong 'cus my songs got me digital checks
Gigabytes decide the words that I write, I get gone nigga day and night
Unh. Take it literally
