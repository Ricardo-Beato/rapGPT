15 ContributorsSoulmates & Strippers (Wait For It) Lyrics
Tryna find soul in a soulmate
Lookin' at the clocks like Coldplay
Ain't Barbie but still wanna roleplay
Black dress, blonde hair and a doll face (Like yeah)

She don't even wanna slide
Tell me, what is on your mind?
Baby girl, keep it aside
Baby girl, we never lie
Baby girl, just pick a side (Yeah)
I still remember your love
And your laugh at the shots of Patron (Yeah, yeah)
Buy you the bag, now you go get the bag
And you shop on your own (Ah)
Provided before you could buy it
But now you be walking alone (Yeah, yeah)
You sleepin', you left me in pieces
That's why I been blocking your phone
Let's be honest, girl, I'm never honest
I'mma pop a bottle till the pain away
Break every promise that I'd ever promise you
That's a promise that I'll never break
2Pac on my CD bumping
Looking for a better day
My girl is worried 'bout me dying on the road
Man, some things will never change (Argh)
Now they put me for the cover
Now I'm looking at my brother
Now I'm grinding like no other
It's my life, I fucking love it
Feel like we stuck on the same page
Baby, we ain't on the same book
Feel like I struggled to make change
Baby, don't give me that same look
Went from a couple of G's to half-pounds
In a glasshouse passed in a couple of weeks
And these days, though, I struggle to breathe
Because I don't get nothin' for free, so let my brother be free, ah
You can't harm me, five racks in a Giorgio Armani
Classy, ride 'round in a Class C (Skrrt)
Medusa's head like Versace
Party, bullshit, I don't need half of the bullshit
I drive through with the drive-through (Ching)
And now I laugh at your bullshit like
Don't look back and regret, still not catching my breath
And my actions reflect the heartbreak
I had the neglect to block that, the cash and the cheque
And I drown my pain in the money and smoke
Chase my pays and my brothers ain't broke
Raised like that so my brothers don't show
All the pain like that, so my brothers don't know
You might also like
Tryna find soul in a soulmate
Lookin' at the clocks like Coldplay
Ain't Barbie but still wanna roleplay
Black dress, blonde hair and a doll face (Argh)

Heavy with the flow
I ain't really ever check a message on my phone
Tryna get the cheddar from my seven-figure quote
But I'm thinking it'd be better if we get it on our own
I just threw a party over at Versace
Tell them get the bar full of Henny and Patron
Now I'm in the car seat, telling her the password
Giving me a second 'cause I better be alone
Heartbeat, I don't really know if it's the devil or the coke
Why they wanna start me? Why they wanna harm me?
I don't give a fuck, brah, I'm never gonna know
You just gotta ask me, I've been going hard, G
I'mma get the cheddar just to get a better home
Yeah, I said it, I'm the GOAT, I said it, I'm the GOAT
Like fuck me, ladies, rack on rack in a Rangie
KD, my Achilles strong
The streets peak and my heat is on, I go AC (Ching)
With ya milli, we rock a dope AP
Roll with the X, I watch your bro rate me
Rolex, Saint Laurent, we so HD
Yeah, but I want ya, dog, you don't phase me (Argh)
I be sticking to the facts (Argh)
I got shivers in a pack (Argh)
She got some chron and they want it
No problem, 'cause I got scissors in my dacks (Argh)
Pretty women on my lap (Argh)
I learned that there's more to life
Now all of these labels fall to the table (Hahaha)
What they want for recording rights?
I tell 'em I got signed with a pen
Tellin' all my brothers we can ride to the end
I be on a pathway till I see my last day
Me and all my brothers, we can ride to the death
Marijuana halfway, Ariana Grande's
Looking like a model having lines on her chest
Baby, if you can't pay, use a credit card, babe
Louis Vuitton, I'm gonna buy (Haha, fuck off)
I got a whole reefer to slang
Kickin' a goal, see me go bang
Homie, if you ain't be comin' with money and kush we can roll
Homie, don't hang
I got a whole reefer to slang
Kickin' a goal, see me go bang
Homie, if you ain't be comin' with money and kush I can
Kush I can, kush I can

Homeboy said he got good smoke
But the OGs went through the herb in a hour
Homeboy said he got good coke
Then he shows me a bag of detergent and powder
Chopped it up, then robbed the cunt
We gave head to his best friend's girl in the shower
And people swear we only smoke diesel
It's lethal, it's probably why the herb's all sour
(Switch it up) See ya later, beast creator
Freak of nature, weed and vapours
Sweet in flavour, chopped up when I block past
Like I move E for the credit, forget it
We don't keep the razor, treat inhaler
Cruise like Tom on a top gun when I rock one
Catch air with a deep inhale, go (Ching)
Everybody needs a favour, not me
Joey Johns ounce, get half back (Yep)
I got lit from the fumes on the road (Ah)
Yeah, I been 'round from the start, like (Yep)
I'm the origin, Blues and Maroons
Females on a lorry like Daley
I'm going crazy in a room with the blow
With a Q and a O and a doob and a smoke
And the hotel staff too stupid to know
You got some, then I got one
Mark Waugh, last ball, we do not run
Drop one, Shane Warne when he got spun
Flip him one, I bounce to the ball, I was off stump
Now Chill's out, better chill out
Get a off-cut from the field now
Blue hairs on the bud like Milhouse
Welcome to The Octagon, we go argh1Embed
