1 ContributorSo Be It LyricsAnd if you don’t like this thing, let’s get ready to change it!

It got the summer written all over it
It is time, time for it to happen
What the fuck is it? (Get it!)
Some still can’t deal with it
Kill fast until they kill it
DJ Lord, Public Enemy, they be killin’ it
Still don’t get it confused
Shit I be killin’ it dude
Elevated
It ain’t the shoes
It is what it is
So be it
Ain’t just pointin’ to my fitted
It’s what’s inside it (Get it, get it, get it)
It’s happenin’
It’s got feeling, it’s got groove
Power to the people
It’s got nothing to lose
You can bob it, weave it
Some love it some leave it
Knowledge is power but
Some keep it a secret
Some really need it
Some say it from the rooftops
It’s doorstops and stoops
Till it’s livin’ and breathin’

Yo one two
So bet it and let it be

Y’all know it
So be it
Then be it so
So it be
Revolution
Then let it be known
C-H-A-N-G-E-I-T
So be it and let it be
Y’all know it
So be it
Then be it so
So it be
Revolution
Then let it be known
C-H-A-N-G-E-I-T
So be it and let it be

It can be whatever you believe in
It can’t stop, won’t stop
Not a one size fit
Whatever you want in the world
Start by being it
I’ll never star it, spangle it, banner it
Some voted it
It is what it is
Hope got choked out didn’t it (Get it!)
Press secretaries in suits that just don’t fit
Chuck I got it, can’t stop it
Or cock block it
Ignore these false prophets
Blinded by fake profit
It is a damn shame
It is the same game
It is too late to complain
Can’t stand it (Get it!)
Loud and proud, too strong to ignore it
Either you against it, huh yeah, or you for it
Lie for it, die for it, do your damn best
At the test, come on uh, yeah try for it
Political landscape morbid
Seen my ancestors forbid it
Jahi and Marcus wrote it
(Wooo-eee!)

Y’all know it
So be it
Then be it so
So it be
Revolution
Then let it be known
C-H-A-N-G-E-I-T
So be it and let it be
Y’all know it
So be it
Then be it so
So it be
Revolution
Then let it be known
C-H-A-N-G-E-I-T
So be it and let it be

But you can quote it if I spoke it
I spray words on the target
Hold my pen the same way they hold an AK
Cause you can still lose your life for it
Some belief in me is all that I need
I know it, so be it, it be so, so it be
I never ask for it, that’s just me being me
State of the free it
As I see it through world eyes
Not on the demise
Global people on the rise
Don’t sit!
You pick up the pieces I’ll bring the glue
So be it for me, so you can be you
You pick up the pieces I’ll bring the glue
So be it for me, so you can be you
You pick up the pieces I’ll bring the glue
So be it for me, so you can be you
One two
One two
So be it and let it be

Y’all know it
So be it
Then be it so
So it be
Revolution
Then let it be known (Come on!)
C-H-A-N-G-E-I-T
So be it and let it be
Y’all know it
So be it
Then be it so
So it be
Revolution
Then let it be known
C-H-A-N-G-E-I-T
So be it and let it be

Get up, it’s the moment they fear
Can’t stop won’t stop
Be the change you wanna be
Be the change you wanna see
Get up, it’s the moment they fear
Get up, it’s the moment they fear
C-H-A-N-G-E-I-T
So be it and let it beEmbed
