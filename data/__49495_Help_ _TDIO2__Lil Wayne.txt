Help! Help!
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help! Help!
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help! Help!

So sick, need a doc, yes
A creature, monster like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the toc, when I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock, "Give me a sec"
In the middle of the war where my enemy at
I'm running this shit like Eric Bieniemy back
Cause every time I hit a track, I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out, "Where the sympathy at?"
I attack before you begin to react
I'm from the dirt where the Beatles and John Lennon be at
And now these niggas looking yellow like a penalty flag
It's Weezy baby with this hustle 'til infinity, yeah
Like somebody let the dog out the kennel and ran
Whoever did it was a very smart women or man
Cause I'm coming like the stomp of every marching band
I need y'all to arch your hands and pray for me
I need
You might also like
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help! Help!
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help! Help!2Embed
