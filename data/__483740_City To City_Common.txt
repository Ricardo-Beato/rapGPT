4 ContributorsCity To City Lyrics
The city it blow deep, I know them cold streets
Motif is no peace, can't trust the police
My mama stay out East, hope that she good though
She from Inglewood so she know the hood though
Corners we stood on, that's what I stand for
Justice for hustlers I rap and I chant for
Cousin just got off that thang on his ankle
He seeing that corner from a new angle
Same old to same old, some days are painful
They say be careful, Grandma be stay prayerful
My bros move words with their eyes on sparrow
You in the ghetto where we never settle

The breath of the city, no rest for the weary
No stress it can't hear me, a fist full of fury
No dollars no jewelry, a Chicago story
Place that can kill me is one that can cure me
Hard to ignore me 'cuz we livin' loud now
Fire inside me and things that go "Bow Bow"
Label me wild child, my old man on trial now
Yeah I'm the future but live for the now now
Make my mama proud now, we come from that dirt
I put in that work until my back hurt, uhYou might also like2Embed
