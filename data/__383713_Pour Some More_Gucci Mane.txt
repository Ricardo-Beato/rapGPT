19 ContributorsPour Some More Lyrics
I'm rocking retros with the cargos
I sell so many bricks, I need a barcode
All the vatos in the hood they call me Pablo
Cause I can cook a half a kilo with my eyes closed
I'm in a Lambo' Murcielago
But what's ironic to me is the fact I drive slow
I try to put my dick so deep it touched her tonsils
I'm just an OG in the hood just like your uncle
And I'm shittin' on these niggas like a portable potty
And a brand new Bugatti, mixing Sprite in narcotics
Young nigga super cocky and my verse is melodic
Crazy paint on the Bentley it look like Henn' & Hpnotiq

The bitches on the stage I'mma keep tipping
The pints on deck I'mma keep sipping
Roll up, roll up, hold up, hold up
I'm so froze up, I might throw up
Crack a seal and pour a four up
Kill that cup and pour some more
The bitches on the stage I'mma keep tipping
The pints on deck I'mma keep sipping
Roll up, roll up, hold up, hold up
I'm so froze up, I might throw up
Crack a seal and pour a four up
Kill that cup and pour some more

Cooking dope at Trestle Tree yeah I got the recipe
East Atlanta nigga so I never let you handle me
Hotter than a candle be, straight A, new Jeep Cherokee
My new girlfriend is blackanese, and I run with a bunch of thieves
Your baby momma seen me in Lenox and tried to tackle me
I done got so famous, I can't even eat at Applebee's
I don't give a damn 'bout no nigga say he out rapping me
50 pints of drank in the trap, I want a stack a piece
Three naked hoes in the room, they want a stack a piece
It's twenty thousand just so my goons can sip some Ace with me
Two Ferraris parked at my house, who wanna race with me?
Pick a ticket, let's see who wins to have a date with me
It's Gucci

The bitches on the stage I'mma keep tipping
The pints on deck I'mma keep sipping
Roll up, roll up, hold up, hold up
I'm so froze up, I might throw up
Crack a seal and pour a four up
Kill that cup and pour some more
The bitches on the stage I'mma keep tipping
The pints on deck I'mma keep sipping
Roll up, roll up, hold up, hold up
I'm so froze up, I might throw up
Crack a seal and pour a four up
Kill that cup and pour some more3Embed
