10 Contributors4 My People Lyrics
Yo, this is for my motherf— club heads, you feel me? (Yeah)
Ow!
People, gangsters and pimps and people
Smokin' that lethal reefer
Up in the club with speakers
Hi hats, some base and tweeters
DJ is jockin' needles
Sweat 'til I catch a fever
Call me the illest diva
Yo, I'm on fire
People, go 'head and drink up
Get in the club, get fucked up
See me, you got get lucked up
Someone to touch and rub up
Show me some love, strip off your clothes
And take off your socks

The party's jumpin', I see something fine
Boy, I wanna kiss you, but I'm just too shy
Let me dance with you, let me wear you out
Here's a glass of orange juice, let's go X it out
The music's bangin' way down in my soul
When you dance behind me, I lose all control
Make me grind my hips, make me move my waist
Yo, when the music come on, you take my breath away
You might also like
This is for my people, my party people
And this is for my people, my mother— people
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)
This is for my people (Say what?), my party people
And this is for my people (Huh?), my ecstasy people
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)

I'm at the bar now and I'm buying drinks
And I got this feeling and it's all over me
I wanna dance with you and lick your face
Take me on the dance floor to feel some ecstasy
The vibe is right now and I'm 'bout to score
Mr. DJ, can you play this joint once more?
'Cause I see the man I want, I want him right away
I look him right in his face and say, "Dance with me"

This is for my people, my party people
And this is for my people, my mother— people
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down, get on down)
This is for my people (Say what?), my party people
And this is for my people (Huh?), my ecstasy people
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get down)
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)
Freak that, come here, baby, grab me from the back
Baby, you the mack and you know that
Put the needle on the track, skip that, flip that, bring the beat back
Oh, freak that, come here, baby, grab me from the back
Baby, you the mack and you know that
Put the needle on the track, skip that, flip that, bring the beat back
Uno (Uno), dos (Dos), tres (Tres)
Uno (Uno), dos (Dos), tres (Tres)
Uno (Uno), dos (Dos), tres (Tres)
Uno (Uno), dos (Dos), tres (Tres)

Can't stand when a nigga fuckin up my plans
All night ducking him while I'm tryna dance
Drunk and his breath stink, freaky with his hands
Cocky with his mouthpiece like he got a fan
Can't stand when a bitch all on my side
I don't even know her and she all up in my light
Givin' me the side eye like she wanna fight
Philly known for boxing, bitch, better get it right
Can't stand when a DJ fuckin' up the song
Know I'm tryin to shake my ass all night long
Cuttin' up the same shit all night long
High 'fore I got there, now my shit is blown
Can't stand when it ain't jumpin' like I want
Bouncer try stop my fun, take away my blunt
I don't give a fuck, he ain't gon' take away my fun
See him when this shit is over, make a nigga run, uh
This is for my people, my party people
And this is for my people, my mother— people
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down, down)
This is for my people (Say what?), my party people
And this is for my people (Huh?), my ecstasy people
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)2Embed
