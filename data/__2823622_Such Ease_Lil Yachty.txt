24 ContributorsSuch Ease Lyrics
We no longer live the same life no more
I remember nights we slept on the floor
Now we can buy 'bout anything when we please
We survived through the breeze with such ease
We no longer live the same life no more
I remember nights we slept on the floor
Now we can buy 'bout anything when we please
We survived through the breeze with such ease
Such ease
We survived through the breeze
Such ease
We survived through the breeze

That's my brother, could've been my own mother's son
Told my brother just keep working, we gon' leave 'em all stunned
Look at us now
Lil Boat, Lil Perry are on the prowl
Got the crowd goin' wild
Niggas been stealin' our style, I'll take it as compliments
Lil Boat the king of the teens, I need me a monument
Our niggas been puttin' in work, I know you see evidence
All of my bitches be heaven sent, all of my bitches be oh
I know we make it look easy
I know we make it look cool
But niggas can't do what we do
But niggas can't do what we do
You might also like
We no longer live the same life no more
I remember nights we slept on the floor
Now we can buy 'bout anything when we please
We survived through the breeze with such ease
We no longer live the same life no more
I remember nights we slept on the floor
Now we can buy 'bout anything when we please
We survived through the breeze with such ease
Such ease
We survived through the breeze
Such ease
We survived through the breeze

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
We gon' survive, yeah
Ain't no nine to five, no
We do or we die, woah
Yeah, with our hands to the sky
For my brothers I'll ride
'til my life say goodbye
'til my life say goodbye

We no longer live the same life no more
I remember nights we slept on the floor
Now we can buy 'bout anything when we please
We survived through the breeze with such ease
We no longer live the same life no more
I remember nights we slept on the floor
Now we can buy 'bout anything when we please
We survived through the breeze with such ease
Such ease
We survived through the breeze
Such ease
We survived through the breeze
Through the breeze
Such ease
We survived through the breeze
Ain't no nine to five
Ain't no nine to five
Woah2Embed
