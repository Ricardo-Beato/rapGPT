66 ContributorsBloody Mary Lyrics
(I'ma be alright because Dizzy here wildin')

Okay, time to make my mark, I gave 'em a head start (Yeah)
Now I'm on my Nicki shit, I don't need no frauds (Nah)
Time to raise the bar, rappin' like I passed the bar (Yeah)
You would think I ride bikes, boy, the way I handle bars (Yeah)
Real niggas in charge (Yeah), we back for what's ours (Ours)
Poppin' all these blues, I might turn into an Avatar
They ain't wanna see me back, he's back
Human crack in the flesh, sorry, I had to relapse (Sorry)
These niggas weak, whack, I twist 'em like weed wraps
Still on my Nino Brown, still getting G money on G-packs (Woo)
No Stunna Man, bustin' like Duh Duh Man, it's evident
These hoes love me, they say my dick is they medicine
Cosby, spikin' gelatin, still pushin' and pedalin'
Settling never, I'm like DiCaprio in The Revenant
Still whippin' and stretchin' it, two pots, ambidextrous
I'm a beast, a dog, I see that money, I'm fetchin' it
Your ho throwin' it at me, I'm catchin' it
Don't check me, go check your bitch
You don't want to get me out of my element
From a tenant in the tenements to owning my residence (One)
Phone still clicking, I feel like the receptionist
Out of this world, yes, he is, extraterrestrian (Woo)
My life's a fucking movie, boy, don't get yourself edited (Out)
I'm like Steph at the free throw, that piece blow, I never miss
Taught your girl how to whip the girl, now she a lesbian (Yeah)
You can level up, still won't be on my level then, it's level ten
These niggas hot, I must be kettlin'
They don't want the steam, but I know you want the tea
That's your bitch? Why she only fuck with me? 'Cause I'm ballin', MSG (Ballin')
Roof missin' on this whip and I need two kitchens (Two)
Your bitch say I'm number two, yeah, too different (True)
Weakest get bagged, start singing, yeah, loose lippin' (Loose)
Tell the DA I ain't never been no stool pigeon (Never)
Won't catch me in no club unless my tool get in (Ever)
Be smart, 'cause Bounce, he a fool with it
It's on, say it's on, I'm 7-Eleven with it
That's twenty-four seven with it, wherever, whatever with it, yeah (Wherever)
Your mama gon' need a church with a reverend in it
Just pray it's a heaven in it, and hope that they let you in it, yeah
Boy, I expose the truth in lies (Yup)
Cross me and get crucified, no shootin' five
War's on, that bazooka rise, get neutralized
Shoot five times five, watch you divide
In a sheet like the sheik ridin' through Dubai (Yup)
Game back in a chokehold, the noose was tied (Ayy)

Suicide, it's a suicide
Tell 'em seek and you will find 'cause I'ma lose my mind
Kick a nigga ass, then give him my shoes to shine
It's do or die, I come from where we used to crime
The Uzi 9 more important than school supplies, the pools is dry
My niggas and the food is fried, the news is lies
The pigeons is too spooked to fly, the rules denied
All the toughest goons is mine, that's Tunechi's slimes
They kill you and go do the time, we unified
Young Money revolutionized the new design
We had to leave the flukes behind and supersize
The numbers through the roof and sky
Don't look too surprised, look through the lines
We makin' moves and strides, grooves and vibes
I'm too alive, these hoes need to be supervised
They put on a cute disguise, you grooms is blind
She get dick and an Uber ride, number two with fries, I'm pimpin'
Now, who am I? I'm who and why
I'm rude and kind, my cars are computerized
I'm cruisin' by, smokin' blunts Ruben size
You fools can try, these tools getting utilized, you euthanized
Brrt, skrrt, shoot, then drive
Now, who survived? We comin' back to rewind
I'm usually high, sippin' on the Houston wine
Feel humanized, I want my throne to recline
Jackie red, Julie blonde, they Cuban fine
I bruise they spine, I leave and they snooze 'til nine
Superglued to the grind, my crew my tribe
These bitches try to divide, we too divine
Got the drugs to provide the coolest highs
The greenest green and the white with the bluest eyes
The syrup and the juice collide, the two combine like suits and ties
Magic, poof, goodbye
Smoke good weed
It's bloody mary if you fuck with me
Yeah, them boys back around
Bitch, we ride, then fire
It's do or die
Smoke good weed
It's bloody mary if you fuck with me
Yeah, them boys back around
Bitch, we ride, then fire
It's do or die
Smoke good weed11Embed
