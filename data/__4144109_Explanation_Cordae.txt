6 ContributorsExplanation Lyrics
Yeah, uh

Coming out of McDonalds, I ordered a Quarter Pounder
Outside, they surround us, and dope, they finally found us
Out of his waste deep cooler, and justifying the toolies
Not understanding and demanding the reason for bullshit
These niggas I was cool with, and naturally went to school with
My methods, very foolish, my mouth's foaming, I'm drooling
Anticipation, waiting, your life could end any day, man
Who and when we jam us, we another plot by Raymond
To understand the present, you must first learn the past
It musta been last Thursday, was his girl's birthday
See I was there, cuz me and Raymond was close friends
And there I say, is when the story begins
See, this girl was always flirting, I was sure that she want me
And honestly, I wanted her back
And while he was there, there was nothing to that
Plus I was never a snake, but soon got carried away
We met the very next day
And honestly it was worth it cuz his girl was so perfect
And anything he decided to do, man I deserved it
Fast forward, he screamed, "Do you want to be a clown now"
He musta found out what I'm doing, so I bowed down

Yeah
You punk ass know who you are
Lost
Step inside

It was a plan
After me, Jimmy was his closest man
We should ride this nigga after school
Take his wallet and his shoes
Find a ride to McDonalds, you know he like Quarter Pounders
Throw his ass in the trashes, and keep him quiet and surround him
"Hey Jimmy, I don't think you heard the story before
I was cooling last Thursday, found out she a hoe"
And said, "You're a liar. I was trying hard to fuck if I can
Why you going smacking my girl and saying you my mans"
But fuck it
Back to the story, he know that he ain't got the glory
After robbing this nigga, I just might get back with Tory
And the adrenaline rush, send me shaking my hand
And I fired a couple shots, no mercy up in my mans
For real, I don't think he gon' live to see a deal
We drinking while popping pills
I'm stretching to make this kill
Uh, he start to panic, prolly thinking bout his will
I take the mask off, and told him that you know I'm Raymond still
