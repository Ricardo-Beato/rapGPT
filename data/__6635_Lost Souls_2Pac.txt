'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time (lost soul)
How it start, how it start?

Started off with runnin' from coppers
Duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us?
Livin' the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' 25 to life if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF state Feds, scandalous bitches
How was it promised to us, was it bitter or sweet?
See, if a nigga don't hustle, then the nigga don't eat
On these streets, livin' do or die, circle complete
Repetitive motions of felons in a rush for G's
Please understand my history, a man of many hats
Lived a Thug Life, (Thug Life Baby) Comin' equipped with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, in the cracks, but blind
Even though we have hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time, huh
Stranded in the County in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my 21 birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost souls… lost souls, nigga
For my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a lost soul
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time, huh

My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with a three-five
When he get out, will I be dead or alive?
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to bust and keep my fuckin' trap shut
My mom dukes got a little bit of thug in her
The devil loves sinners, crackheads and drug dealers
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin' over
Never stayin' sober, the brain over and over
Backtrack, my steps that I used to take down New
One love to my crew, ay yo, this one's for you

R.I.P. … rest in peace to Mu grandmother
Know what we gotta do, baby, one-time

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time, huh
Yeah roll wit' a nigga (Where my niggas at?) Roll wit' a nigga
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine (Sunshine)
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time, huh!
One-time! One-time! One-time
I was born 22 years ago yesterday (Happy birthday nigga happy birthday)
But see, I saw no reason for me to celebrate
Let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein' consumed, already predictin' my doom
Soon to be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done, tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin' the time of day
Grind for pay, I'm on my way
But don't know where I'ma end up
I swear to God, this just a set-up
And these are the words from the mind of a lost soul

Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Yeah, the ballad of the lost souls
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Ballad of the lost souls you know how it is (Ride with me)
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
(I feel that shit) Can you feel me nigga? Can you feel me?
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
How bout we do one for all the niggas in the pen?
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life (Walkin' in the sunshine)
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
One for Mutulu, one for Geronimo (That's right One love)
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life (Walkin' in the sunshine)
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
(Killa) All the niggas gettin' beat up by the dogs... (Thug Life)
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life (Walkin' in the sunshine)
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
(One time nigga one time nigga)
All them niggas gettin' arrested and ain't did shit
Just wait until the rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
All of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell
For all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Throw your hands up!
Throw your hands up! (Outlaw)
Throw your hands up!
Throw your hands up! (Outlaw)
It's for all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourselfEmbed
