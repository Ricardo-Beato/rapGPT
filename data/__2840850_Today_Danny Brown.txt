Watch who you 'round, gotta watch they mouth
When them guns come out and them shots ring out, you know what they about
Watch what they say, watch what they do
When a hook come around, them kids come down, they'll tell on you
It's snakes in the grass gettin' trapped by rodents
Potent we smoking'll leave you choking
Hoping you focused, so dog, take notice
'Fore a flash of light run you off like roaches
Hopping off porches with chrome for focus
Nose long as song made by Mike Bolton
Lightning bolts rip through your torso
Raining blood after that thunder
Mama crying, children wonder
But this is the life that we all succumb to
Make a nigga wanna go and cut his phone off
Cops kill a nigga every day like protocol
Watch the TV, turn on the news
Make a nigga feel like he listened to blues
In the hood with that Arm & Hammer
Gettin' them Pampers for baby mama
Hood flicked us, we in the slammer
Now your baby raised by another man, bruh
Cure for cancer, cure for A.I.D.S. 
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Everywhere you go, gotta keep that tool
'Cause you don't want it end up happen to you
So everywhere you go, gotta keep that tool
'Cause you don't want it end up happen to you

Gotta watch these niggas
Better watch these niggas
For a little bit of crumbs, when you trapped in the slums, they'll pop you, nigga
Watch where you go, watch where you at
'Cause goons on attack and that's a fact, you don't want it like that
Niggas get bodied like every day
Nigga masked up like masquerade
Bruiser Brigade, nigga, take this fade
Or get marked out like crossword game
For a little name, nigga pop your chain
Playing no games, evict arcade
Trade in your life for a new pair of J's
A-OK with them AK's
Broad daylight, make you do a relay
Duck behind cars when you hear the tool spray
You don't want beef, get simmered, soufflé
Sittin' in the Bimmer with your lightskin bae
Fuck all that tough shit, I'm tryna get paid
You ain't 'bout money, nigga, you the same way
End of the day, nigga, jail the new slave
Trust, my nigga, you don't wanna go that way
