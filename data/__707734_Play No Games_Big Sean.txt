Girl, it's true
You do, you do, you do
It's true (Oh)
It's waitin' for you (Uh-huh)
Girl, it's true

Okay, I won't deny it
Half the time you send a text (Brr), yep, you know I'm not replyin'
Just to let you know, I'm not one of them niggas you be dodgin'
I'm the one that you dodge with (Swerve, swerve, swerve)
I'm the one that you gon' take that dress you savin' out the closet (Woah)
I'm the one you need alone
I'm the one that when you 'round your friends that you gotta put on speakerphone
Just so you can let them know what we be on, like he the one, yeah, yeah
I know I'm young, but you respect me like a father figure
Young mobbish nigga, prolly make you father figures
Sean Don Perrier out in Paris with a pair of Yays goin'
Well, I would tell you, but I gotta paraphrase
And even when you trippin', we trippin', I pay for ya
Gourmet for ya, chauffeur arranged for ya
I'll take that flight alone earlier in the day for ya
Just to beat you there and prepare, let you know I'm waitin' for ya
Finally Famous
You might also like
I ain't like them other niggas (Other niggas)
And I ain't 'bout to play no games with you (Play no games)
You know what your problem is? (Oh)
You don't ever see the big picture
Oh-wee, I want you to take me serious
Oh, baby, I want you to take me serious
Aw, yeah, yeah (Waitin' for you)

Wait, wait, waitin' for ya
I be wait, wait, waitin' for ya (Girl, it's true)
You got a young boss nigga like me waitin' for ya
You got that bomb ass, pussy, I'll be waitin' for ya (Yeah)
Who ya love? (Tell me)
Tell me who you fuckin' love (Tell me)
Tell me who you wanna fuck and love
I left that sexy dress out on the bed with a note there layin' for ya
With directions where I'm waitin' with dinner and waiter for ya (For ya)
I'm that nigga (Nigga), she tell me I'm that nigga
I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga (Uh)
That you make love with, but right before, take drugs with
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds
Then you back that ass up on me like it's '99 (Woah)
Wine fine like a bottle from the '99 (Uh-huh)
Hit you with the ninety-nine like it's fuckin' primetime (Time)
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times (Woo)
Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya (There for ya)
I'm all ears, in other words here for ya (Here for ya)
I'd probably rob a fuckin' bank and go to jail for ya (Uh-huh)
As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya
Finally Famous (Famous)
I ain't like them other niggas (Other niggas)
And I ain't 'bout to play no games with you (Play no games)
You know what your problem is? (Oh)
You don't ever see the big picture
Oh-wee, I want you to take me serious
Oh, baby, I want you to take me serious
Aw, yeah, yeah (Waitin' for you)
I've been waitin' on that ass all night though
Girl, don't keep me waiting no more
Yeah, yeah
It's true
Got some things I wanna do to you, baby, oh
Ooh, yeah

I ain't like them other niggas (Other niggas)
And I ain't 'bout to play no games with you (Play no games)
You know what your problem is? (Oh)
You don't ever see the big picture
Oh-wee, I want you to take me serious
Oh, baby, I want you to take me serious
Aw, yeah, yeah (Waitin' for you)136Embed
