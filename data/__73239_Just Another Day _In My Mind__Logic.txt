54 ContributorsJust Another Day (In My Mind) Lyrics
Yeah

Will I make it? I don't know
From the bottom of my heart I swear to God I gotta blow
This for every time the world told me no
If I don't make it in this game I ain't got nowhere else to go
From the drama to the hoes, from the records to the shows
I gotta make it, and if they don't give me what I deserve
Then I'ma take it, I've been underrated, underestimated and hated
But I can't wait to look back and say that I made it
'Cause nowadays everyone's a rapper and I hate it

Y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh
Said y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh

I had to face my demons and embrace all of my fears
While you was out partying, chilling and sipping on some beers
I was sacrificing adolescent years
Blood, sweat, and tears to find out what music really is
And now I'm feeling, I'm feeling like the moment has arrived
Where Bobby is no longer living and Logic has revived
From his ashes, music, money, liquor, I'm fucking passed this
Lyricism that's driven from a master, you bastards
You might also like
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)

All I ever wanted was some financial security
And now I fuck with bitches just to mask my insecurities
'Cause pussy ain't nuttin', but my heart is sure full of something
Now I'm, colder than ever, pushing through any weather
High score flow, ain't none of y'all close to my level
Mental state of a winner in the shoes of a beginner
Visualizing my horizon through the eyes of a sinner
Noticing how the line between me and fame is getting thinner

Y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh
Said y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh

Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)
You know my steelo, busting shots like free throws
The young bandido, cutting records like they was kilos, ha
Is it a blessing that I'm messing with girls
That wanna undress in the back of my car, or is it just 'cause I'm a star?
Or is it just 'cause I'm a star?
Five-foot-seven, look like she fell from heaven
With an ass hotter than the devil, please call a reverend
She was black and asian, part Hispanic and part amazing
Women they feen' us, merely because we are the keenest
My heart only has one love like Serena and Venus
You know I am the meanest genius with the biggest (hey!)
See, baby girl, I know you got some problems
Just know I'm here to solve 'em, revolve 'em, cock 'em back and dissolve 'em
I swear I take care of all em' but you gotta trust it
Love it, open your heart before you lust it, now bust it, what

Just another day living in the hood
Just another day living in the hood
Just a—Just another—Just another—Just another day
Lovely (I feel lovely) Sunny Norway
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)
Just another day living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feeling good today (I feel good, yeah)
Feeling lovely (I feel lovely)11Embed
