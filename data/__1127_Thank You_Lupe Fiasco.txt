Aw
You don't get it

I'm just a wolf inside a lion's suit
A shark shirt, a panther's pants, piranha hat and tiger shoes
I got a lion's den inside the booth
That right there is point-blank
This here is from where the snipers shoot
Might take a long time to get it, by the time I hit it
I done ran Bubble Tape around them Chiclets—poof!
I ain't the bomb, I'm the company that got the contract
To rebuild during the aftermath—have a blast
Going green only using half the gas
The calming comes through after disasters have
But this calm has the same fury that disasters have
I should have a class
I'm the son of the South Pole, plus Alaska's dad
Got niggas like, "Dag!"
Flow is like crazy, gone mad
And villains gone bad
Punk-ass niggas—don't be so daft
Baby, why you hanging with them Busters, like Babs?
They are such a drag—you should move 'em to the "Trash"
Feel like I'm walking 'round upon Cassius calves
Quite a beautiful script, and such a gift of gab
A big Bay shout-out to Mistah F.A.B
Young Frankenstein reporting live from the lab
I bought the bars out—put it on my tab
If you came here to box, you'll leave in a bag
I run the game: Bilderberg Group
In the lead with The Flash
Usain Bolt ain't even even this fast
Why you take offense with your defensive ass?
Never Hussein in the hole—not even in the half
'Cause, nigga, I ain't hiding
I'm the whole world; nigga, you're an island
And the seas rising; if I keep shining—
You going have to take submarines to the drive-in, now
You might also like
Great
Enemy of the State
Go, go, go, goEmbed
