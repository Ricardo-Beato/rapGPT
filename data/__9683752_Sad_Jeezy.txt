7 ContributorsSad Lyrics
ATL Jacob he a fuckin' Millionaire
808 Mafia

One thing about it, bitch, I came in for
The math (Math)
Two things about it, bitch, I came in for
The cash (Yeah)
Ain't no question, bitch, I'm leavin' with
The bag (Aye)
Three things for certain, these niggas
Goin' out sad
One thing about it, bitch, I came in for
The math (Math)
Two things about iit, bitch, I came in for
The cash
Ain't no question, bitch, I'm leavin' with
The bag (Bag)
Three things for certain, these niggas
Goin' out sad

White Rarri, it's a drop top (Drop top)
Better watch these niggas 'cause they
Flip flop (Flip flop)
Royal Oak AP, it don't tick tock (Nah)
One place you'll never see me, that's on
TikTok (Yeah)
Hood Trap Cafe, it ain't TIP's spot
Them bank accounts ini good shape, I'm
Talkin tip top
Them chatty patty ass niggas need they
Lips locked (Locked)
Any niggas hatin' on me can suck a big
(Whoa, whoa)
You might also like
One thing about it, bitch, I came in for
The math (Math)
Two things about it, bitch, I came in for
The cash (Yeah)
Ain't no question, bitch, I'm leavin' with
The bag (Aye)
Three things for certain, these niggas
Goin' out sad
One thing about it, bitch, I came in for
The math (Math)
Two things about it, bitch, I came in for

Question is, where the real niggas?
Where the real niggas?
Once upon a time we was drug dealers
I'm like, what's up with the hate? Shit I
Love niggas (Love niggas)
Even put niggas on , shit I plugged niggas
(Yeah)
They out here chasin'  clout, and I'm out
Here chasin' zeros
Ask about me in the hood, I'm a
Neighborhood hero (Hero)
It ain't no question, yeah, he been a
Street nigga
The only difference is, he a really discrete
Nigga (Yeah)
Party at the feds and I didn't get invited
(Nah)
I'm thinkin' that's the reason that I didn't
Get indicted
A nigga made it out, and I'm thinkin' they
Don't like it (Nah)
I seen this shit comin', I ain't even need
A psychic
One thing about it, bitch, I came in for
The math (Math)
Two things about it, bitch, I came in for
The cash (Yeah)
Ain't no question, bitch, I'm leavin' with
The bag (Aye)
Three things for certain, these niggas
Goin' out sad
One thing about it, bitch, I came in for
The math (Math)
Two things about iit, bitch, I came in for
The cash
Ain't no question, bitch, I'm leavin' with
The bag (Bag)
Three things for certain, these niggas
Goin' out sadEmbed
