First I wake up, wake up, thinking of a plan to get my cake up, cake up
Cause I can't pay the rent with school papers
I need two acres and more
I know how it feel walking out the door pockets out of dough
Out it doe, be on the flow
We smoking indo, but we out though, adios
My audio getting me that Audi dough or the range rov
Mahogany colored clothing, my hog in the road
Drive slow, cruising down memory lane before I hit the streets
Have my melody playing, creators choose flight with my melancholy saying
Head between clouds, I think I'm married to Jane
I remember the days when I'd forever complain
That's way before they started paying, I was in pain
Sick in the brain like I never met a physicist yet
Only lyricist on my metaphysics intellect

Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
And time's not rewinding, yeah

Round two bout, half of this loud through
Don't let them hounds snoop and get soundproofed
High frequency sounds too
Has statik spot over serious statik shots
Scrap vinyls over them statik pops
Im a fanatic fly but a sporadic guy
Never chat a lot, just pass the Lye and guide the youth
Stand with the truth, Nigga nothin' less
When the playbutton pressed
Killswitches feel it hit ya chest
And meet your death, if im caught on the fence know hell hit ya
Yes true vets keeps it real whichya
Ill wit ya, show you the real picture
Only keep the ones around that suffer for meals whichya
Cuz when them suckas, see ya supper
And your cake getting richer and your pockets getting thicker
Thats when they want you to remember a nigga
But when I handed you the tape you couldn't remember to listen
You might also like
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
And time's not rewinding, yeah

Been on my grind, I keep it 50-50
Thats 100 on the real, no balance scales, still trippy
Where I live it's either you know talents well and sell records
Or no talent, well we still sell for the record
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the trap game
In fact is the exact same, and these tracks is my crack caine
And if you listening then you a fiend
Our music is the cure like some vaccines
Exotic to the core so stop asking
Got the blueprints to the game, but I read it as king
There's 47 ways to get this green
One is being an enslaved being, the other dreams
Red pill or blue bean, I can't sit still I'm too lean, nigga
Brush my bill on on new beams
Niggas on my tail now that I blew green

Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
And time's not rewinding, yeah
Sweet dreams stuck in the 90's nigga
Stuck in the 90's nigga
We just some stuck in the 90's niggas30Embed
