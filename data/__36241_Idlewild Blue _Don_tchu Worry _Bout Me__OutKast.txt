Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do

People don't you worry bout me
Evil gon get buried by me
Well, I'm gonna shoot you out of this lil town and
Soon as I do it I'mma get down
Come on
Ah, ah, ah come on

Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do

Mama don't you worry bout me
Papa don't you worry bout me
Well, I live a life but it just ain't mine
I know I'm your son won't you let me shine
Come on
Ah, ah, ah come on

Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do

Sally don't you worry bout me
Sally don't you worry bout me
Don't worry bout me I'll be fine
Well, that's what I tell 'em, baby, but I'm lying
Come on, all people come on

Y'all know bout the blues don't you?
Everybody get the blues
Even babies get the blues

Some call it baby blue
Some call it midnight blue
Some call it navy blue
Whatever hue is what we gonna do
We gon' play until you feel happy
Till there ain't no more blues

Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do

Idlewild
