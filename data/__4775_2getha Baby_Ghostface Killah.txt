26 Contributors2getha Baby Lyrics
"Together baby.. together baby"
"Baby just you and me (just you and me) whoahhh"

Yo, yo
Aiyyo it's Tone, crispy like a pair of headphones
Used to play the 280 party rec rooms
Now I play the big spots all in the city
Spread champagne, scopin out bitties
Pick one, thick one son with small titties
It really doesn't matter as long as she's pretty
Come here mami, dancin right beside me
Tommy Hilfiger cut, skin like Halle
She looked like she get it from her momma (momma)
That's right Michelle, I'm Obama (bama)
Or maybe she get it from Madonna (donna)
+Material Girl+ I still don ya (don ya)
Je-wels is for the girl if she do well
Knew she was dangerous, she rolled me up two L's
Her jelly roll shakin like she into the well
She wanna put my name on her new nails
 - repeat 2X

Yo, yo
Aiyyo I roll on bitches, like a skateboard
Got a few friends that give they cake to whores
Me that's a no-no, Starks take control of a chick
Then I go deep like Tony Romo
Kick 'em right out and the day starts over
Where I don't stop drinkin and I can't stand sober
In the morning when I wake up I get up just to ill
TD Bank is what I do with the mills
Bracelets, Cuban neck is on chill
Polar bear ice, I stay dressed to kill
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
Hittin the haze, now I'm on stilts
I'm too high, stuggle like Precious (Precious)
Love doctor niggas get the message
When it comes to baggin a chick, don't be impressive
I get girls, y'all fellas is desperate
You might also like - repeat 2X

Yeah
Yeah, yo
Yo son tap that girl, excuse me miss
You gangster~! Far from a bougie chick
Love the way you talk, your jeans fit nice
Still a lil' hood in you, you just my type
Go 'head swallow that Nuvo, no disrespect
You front on me tonight I'mma bag me a new ho
Spank that ass like a real papichulo
That Jimmy Neutron will sit you right on your culo
 - repeat 2X

That's right sexy lady
Come and have a seat baby
Come get a taste of this Patron and Nuvo
This that Jimmy Neutron baby
Your lipstick lookin all good put your lips on this baby
Come sip on this, aight?
