Woo-uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, come on

What's good? (Come on)
Young Decatur, comin' straight out the hood (That's right)
I'm just tryna put the spirit in your Yeezy Boosts (Yeezy Boosts)
Get your cup, it runneth over once I got the juice
Every day is Sunday mornin', woo, you hella late (You hella late)
See the colors of my father when I meditate
I'ma give it to you, mama, I can't even lie
Amber-colored lotus flowers when I touch the sky
I ain't even high, uh

There is love in every moment
Under the sun, boy
I did what I wanted to
There is love in every moment
Under the sun, boy
You do what you wanna do

Ooh, my beard long, damn, I look like Jesus (Uh)
And my shirt is off, ooh, I feel like Fela (Uh)
On my mama, boy, you silly, tryna please a hater
Do you feel me? (Nah, nah) Ya'll don't hear me (Nah, nah)
Said I feel good, (Feel good) look good (Look good)
East Atlanta, (Gresham Park) Hollywood (Hollywood)
Never said it even though I prolly should (Woah)
I said I love me, l said I love me, ah, yeah

There is love in every moment
Under the sun, girl
I did what I wanted to
Ooh, ooh
There is love in every moment
Under the sun, girl
You do what you wanna do
Uh-huh

When you looking at the devil
But you lookin' in the mirror
What you gon' say? (Wait a minute)
Uh, uh, when your money getting long
But you know you're doin' wrong
What you gon' say? (Wait a minute)
Uh, uh, when you know your mama dyin'
And you runnin' out of time
What you gonna say? (Wait a minute)
Uh, when you feel alone
Know you are not alone (Wait a minute)
Ah, yeah

There is love in every moment
Under the sun, boy
I did what I wanted to, yeah, yeah
Now I just power forward
Under the sun, in every moment
I did what I wanted to
Everything that you're feeling right now (Ooh)
Let it out, let it out (Ooh, ayy)
