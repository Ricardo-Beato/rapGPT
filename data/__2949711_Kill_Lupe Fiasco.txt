Saturday night for niggas
Astronauts and alcohol
We're like satellites for strippers
I'm talkin' 187, make that mothafucka pop
Runnin' 'round and 'round we go
Saturday night for niggas
Astronauts and alcohol
We're like satellites for strippers
Runnin' 'round and 'round she go
We got dollar bills to kill

My nigga, if these poles could talk
If the stage grew another pole, got up and walked
Gotta kill these dollars, it can't be an assault
Need your real love, mama, you can't be in my thoughts
Oh no, I knew a ten down in Houston
So I wonder if you can do it slow-mo
Then speed it up, heat it up, drop it down, beat it up
Take it off, make it talk, shake it all, make it fall
ATL, ATM, mama love to take it all

Saturday night for niggas
Astronauts and alcohol
We're like satellites for strippers

Just another Saturday night
Showtime, I deserve these lights
'Cause I work hard for what I get
Just so I can give my ten percent
You better pay up, pay up or get out
I'm not into how you get down
Hope you love me in the moment, but I know where I'm goin'
And I'm just tryna get through this

Saturday night for niggas

Man, girl, I made a killin' off these drunk ass niggas tonight
Ayy, bruh, that shit was goin' up, man
But damn, they ain't had my pole clean today? I'm sick of this shit
This bitch spilled her mothafuckin' drink on my goddamn shoes
You dirtier than a mothafucka, dawg
Next time they better have my shit clean
'Cause I can't go up in this strip club
Ayy, it's cool though (you already know)
I'll get some new ones tomorrow, fuck it
You know the other spot poppin'? (yeah)
No more doin' that shit and tryna go to church in the morning
Let's go to the other spot
Now it's Sunday mornin' for sinners
Preacher's daughter, holy water
Be reborn, beginner
'Round and 'round we know
It's like dollar bills to save
Make it rain on that collection plate
Need a dollar bill to save
Make it rain on that collection plate
And your dollar bills can save
Make it rain on that collection plate
You made it clap, now take it back (Pray)
You made it clap, now take it back (Pray)
You made it clap, now take it back (Pray)
You made it clap, now take it back (Woo)
Watch it all wash away (Hmm)
Watch it all wash away (Yeah, pray)
Watch it all wash away4Embed
