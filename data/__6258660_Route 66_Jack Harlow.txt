Right here, mmm

Bitch I'm from Kentucky but this ain't no fuckin' Dixie Chicks
This is not Route 66
She step out, take like fifty flicks
I'm way too selective with the folks that I get mixy with
She said, "That's a lie, boy"
You a thot, thot, thot
Just left out the city, it was hot, hot, hot
Think they fuckin' with me but they not, not, not
I just cannot stop
I'm 'bout to buy my bro a drop
She came to kick it with her friends
They takin' shots, shots, shots

I'm a hot shot (Ayy)
Met her at the club and I took her to the casa (casa)
Get bread nonstop
Know my name, ring a bell like Raja
From the city like Rondo, Rajon
But I'm from the white side like Hassan
Way too fly but I'm not trying
Had y'all's fun but it's my time
Chain go bling
I ain't talking 'bout hotline
Young and I got time
But I finally got one, it's about time
Make the whole city shine every time that I shine
Let me know now if you not down
'Cause you left and you not 'round
Need a Julep and a hot brown
Go 'head, let that top down
You might also like
Bitch I'm from Kentucky but this ain't no fuckin' Dixie Chicks
This is not Route 66
She step out, take like fifty flicks
I'm way too selective with the folks that I get mixy with
She said, "That's a lie, boy"
You a thot, thot, thot
Just left out the city, it was hot, hot, hot
Think they fuckin' with me but they not, not, not
I just cannot stop
I'm 'bout to buy my bro a drop
She came to kick it with her friends
They takin' shots, shots, shots

Yeah, white gold over my Chrome Hearts
Ten bands sloppy, I ain't got no card
I don't feel nothing for the most part
Fat boy drive this bitch like a go-kart
Slide through the opp blocks shooting out blow darts
I been rich before I signed
Shirt cost five, wear it one time
She don't slurp, get out my ride
Run my city, you can ask my opps
Love my thots with mouths like mops
Shirt off, chains on in a drop
I spent twenty G's for a clock
Put a Bentley GT in my mouth
We don't sell CD's out this house
Still got (*bark bark*) in now
Like what's a drought, drought, drought?
Bitch I'm from Kentucky but this ain't no fuckin' Dixie Chicks
This is not Route 66
She step out, take like fifty flicks
I'm way too selective with the folks that I get mixy with
She said, "That's a lie, boy"
You a thot, thot, thot
Just left out the city, it was hot, hot, hot
Think they fuckin' with me but they not, not, not
I just cannot stop
I'm 'bout to buy my bro a drop
She came to kick it with her friends
They takin' shots, shots, shots6Embed
