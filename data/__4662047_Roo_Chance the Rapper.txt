56 ContributorsRoo Lyrics
Roosters calling in the distance

It was all us crammed in the house
Back when my dad was the man of the house
A lot of dads left, they abandoned the house
My dad Joe Jack, start a band in the house
He said one friend, one friend in the house
Only one friend in the whole wide world
One day will come when you only have each other
Never give it up for a boy or a girl
We come in peace but we don't come in pieces
We on some tag-team WWE shit
We look just alike, the prestige is so prestigious
The splitting image of Lupita standing on them beaches
Don't tweak and don't be facetious
Those shells'll shred you to pieces
These niggas faking like demons
But I'ma send 'em to Jesus (It's just me and my bro)
Versus all of you heathens
They think I'm reading Ephesians
I have all these niggas hiding, avoiding meetings like vegans
I got the keys like I'm Keegan
I'll line the trunk with the bleach
And I'll leave you inside the freezer and let you chill for the weekend
But forget over the weekend and come back inside a month
And I throw you inside the trunk but it's plastic so it ain't leakin'
But we can be cool
We can be cool
Me and my brother
We can be cruel
Find your ass
Line your ass up
Go to work on 'em
You might also like
Roosters calling in the distance

It's a lot more crammed in the house
Back when Chance was the man of the house
Baseball bats if they ran in the house
We from out south like birds in the clouds
When I was eleven, heard my homie dad died
This shit deeper than music, I got PTS for life
So if you do production just make sure the drums right
The independent Bennetts will never need your advice
Our image won't diminish 'cause Charlie and Marley right
Me and Chano like Peschi and Robin's life
A made man, we just makin' the songs right
You just makin' the song hype
I really snapped, the last time I rapped I was movin' packs
In adolescence, seen ambulances, learned other lessons
Catchin' blessings, overstretchin' from first-hand impressions
Chano called my phone voicemail, hope he don't get a message
Heard that I exit from my axis off that intersection
So if you say somethin' 'bout big bro, bitch, I'ma smack you reckless
We from down south, we bogus twice and we are not from Texas
One more rep, can't run around strapped, so I walk around like pedestrian
Chi-town summer lookin' like my numbers, and you know how I'm bomin', ain't checkin' it
Called big bro, now we run it up, set it up, get it up, nigga, now let's begin
OTF, free Durk and them
We was inside with a curfew then
What's fire without earth and wind?
And what's a fight when it's worth the win? Yeah6Embed
