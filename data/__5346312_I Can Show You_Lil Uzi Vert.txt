63 ContributorsI Can Show You Lyrics
Uh (I'm working on dying)
Yeah, let me know
Yeah, let it go (Yeah)

I might move like a cobra
But I'm far from a snake (Snake)
Said I live in the moment (Moment)
Got an expensive taste
She tried to lie for the money, uh
Know that girl want my cake, ooh (Yeah)
My chain straight from the ocean, uh
Your chain straight from the lake, yeah
Slam on her, O'Neal (Yeah)
I do not care how you feel (Woo)
And all my diamonds, they teal
White gold, but your chain steel (Woo)
Boy, you so broke, that's real (Yeah)
Armstrong on the money like Neil
Red stripes when I lift my shoe (Woo)
Red bottom on the bottom of her heel (Heel)

Um, yeah, we take the top off the foreigns
Take the top off, now she snorin' (Skrrt)
Um, yeah, took my redbone on vacay'
Now she woke up and she orange (Vroom)
Um, yeah, I can tell them niggas fake
But I don't know what he on (Ayy, ayy)
Um, yeah, he known to just make it rain
But I'm known to just make it storm (Woah, woah)
Um, yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
None of these bitches I chase, uh
Bitch, I'm addicted to Chase, ayy (Woah)
Money stack up in my safe, ayy
Racks bustin' out so it ain't safe, ayy (Woah)
She wanna hit my weed but I told this girl, "This a face" (Ayy)
I swear y'all niggas, y'all late
Y'all turnin' that Human Made right into BAPE, ayy
Uh, your pockets are weight
You try to keep up and them shits, they deflate, yeah
Okay, I got me a 'Gatti, uh
Just in case you try to race (Ayy)
Okay, I know 'bout some bodies
But I put my hand on my face (Shh)
You might also like
I might move like a cobra
But I'm far from a snake (Snake)
Said I live in the moment (Moment)
Got an expensive taste
She tried to lie for the money, uh
Know that girl want my cake, ooh (Yeah)
My chain straight from the ocean, uh
Your chain straight from the lake, yeah
Slam on her, O'Neal (Yeah)
I do not care how you feel (Woo)
And all my diamonds, they teal
White gold, but your chain steel (Woo)
Boy, you so broke, that's real (Yeah)
Armstrong on the money like Neil
Red stripes when I lift my shoe (Woo)
Red bottom on the bottom of her heel (Heel)
