Crabs in a bucket

Crabs in a bucket
Wanna see you at the bottom, don't you love it?
When they're hatin' so you hit 'em with the encore
Sendin' shots, but you at the top floor
Let 'em pop shit, gimme some drums to go pop with
Need white women at the shows unconscious
If not that, then topless, earned all this
Get with that or get in the mosh pit
Where's your moxie? Ain't you from Poppy?
Young man, you not actin' too cocky
Prolly 'cause I'm feelin' like the world gon' crash
Read a hundred somethin' on the E-class dash
If I'm feelin' funny, guaranteed gon' flash
Cock back, blast, put 'em in a bag
Prolly gon' regret it in the retrospect
Got a lot of problems I ain't let go yet

Spend a lot of money on the CDG
Ain't I lookin' lovely on the TV screen?
Battle with the white man day by day
Feds takin' pictures doin' play by play
They donâ€™t ever want to see the Black man eat
Nails in the Black man's hands and feet
Put him on a cross, so we put him on a chain
Lying to me, sayin' he don't look like me
Rollcage on the GT3
How a show on stage like a DVD?
Put me in the MoMA when it's over with
I used to look up to the sky, now I'm over shit
You might also like
Remember that I still got you
I still got you here
It's rare they'd come across you?
I kept you hidden in my head
Drowning in my own ocean
I forgot to care
And you can drop anchor, baby
I know what's under there
It never really crossed my mind to think
Maybe you'd avert your glance at me?
Ever really cross your mind
Ever really cross your mind
I ain't never had no chance to breathe14Embed
