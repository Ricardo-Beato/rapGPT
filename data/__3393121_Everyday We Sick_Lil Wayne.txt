38 ContributorsEveryday We Sick Lyrics
Everything was meant, everything was meant
I took a L, what comes after L? My nigga â€” Ms
That AK with the twins, that's Mary Kate and sis
My shooters, they don't miss; fade away, then swish
Dedication 6, and every day we sick
Treatin' medication scrips like some Revelation scripts
I thought yesterday we quit
But you know, every day we spent
Then we celebrate the win like we'll never play again
Lord I just talked to my hitman, he say that he made a list
Nigga always breakin' in, and he never leave a print
And I never shaved a brick, OK, now I'm talkin' shit
Where that bakin' soda mix? Raise my Arm & Hammer fist
And my yellowbone, she thick, and her belly don't exist
And she never saw the gym, she stay healthy 'cause she strip
Doin' very late events, and I never paid a cent
Pussy never leave a scent, Toni Braxton, breathe again
Every day, all week, we lit, you know every day we sip
And we having steak and shrimp with some naked waitresses
Told that bitch to bring a friend, you know that we make 'em kiss
She know if it's goin' down, I keep a elevator lit
Now where the elevator music? Yeah, they better play the hits
I can serenade a bitch, you interrogate a bitch
If we interrogate that bitch, we be like "Where that safe at, bitch?"
Put that barrel to her tits, and if she hesitate, that's it
I need that combination bitch, 'cause I ain't got no patience bitch
I hate to do it, but the line between love and hate is thin
You know every day we win, you know second place ain't shit
You know that we take the kids, just like Freddy, Jason, IT
You know that we spray and dip, one-eight-seven, eighty-six
While you eatin' bacon grits again while police takin' tips
You know every day we drip, drippin' wet Mercedes-Benz
Drippin' wet and glazy clit, you know every day she drenched
This that Dedication 6, you know every day we sick
Give me wet, a life, a gift, catch a body like the Lyft
This that Dedication 6, if she starstruck, make a wish
I tell her pussy "Take your lick", I'm big-headed, make it fit
You know every day we sick

That's some sick shit, yeah
Shoutout Young Money!
You know every day we sick
That's some sick shit, oh
My nigga Mack Maine
And that's that Dedication 6
You know every day we sick
And you are just a patient, bitch
It's that Dedication 6
You know every day we sick
And that's some sick shit, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
That's some sick shit, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
That's some sick shit, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You know every day we sick6Embed
