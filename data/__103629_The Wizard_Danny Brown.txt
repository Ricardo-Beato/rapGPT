15 ContributorsThe Wizard Lyrics

It ain't even a question will I pop off
Hot like the chicken of the grease with some hot sauce
Used to play the block with the Carhartt
For breakfast it was blunts, bout to get a couple Pop Tarts
Used to ride around with the heckler
Lil' nigga on his grind, Ryan Sheckler
Stash in the dresser
So fuck a school lecture
From professors
Like a teacher I test ya
Never smoke regular haze in a swisher
Runnin' through snow like blades in the winter
Now I treat beats like crack on broke mirrors
Slow like a gem star, nothings been delivered
And now you're all high
So you can thank I
Fuckin' with Brown cause I keep a good supply
I know a lot of fiends that say they can't cry
Cause they sniff so much that it dried out their eyes
And that's real shit

"They makin' money yo that shit is a waste"
"While you lames tryin' to stay in the game we playin' to win" - Phat Kat 'Get It Started'
"Major players gettin' paper by the layers" - Kool G Rap 'Fast Life'
"Sinnin' at the club in Detroit"
"Now that's game, now I hope y'all listen cause" - Hot Rod 'Be Easy'
"Signed or unsigned, MC's get dealt with" - Planet Asia 'Pure Coke'
"I've been too nice, too long"

You ain't gotta answer, "Am I real nigga?"
I was sellin' crack back when it was Tommy Hilfiger
Used to keep revolvers in the Nautica
Now I just send a text, niggas come through, offin' ya
Niggas blowin' horns at your burial
Choir singin' loud and in stereo
Your spirit's gone aerial
Your family will miss you
When we hit you
Real nigga saw the bitch in you
Different individual, not what you're used to
One Danny Brown equal the whole Juice Crew
Nigga you doo doo
We all can smell it
Chronic I smoke, I bail it then inhale it
Pint of gram brew got a nigga on loose
Shawty got a bubble and she said she comin' through
Bitches on my dick cause a nigga so fly
And I fuck so much when I nut my dick cry
And that's real shit

"They makin' money yo that shit is a waste"
"While you lames tryin' to stay in the game we playin' to win"
"Major players gettin' paper by the layers"
"Sinnin' at the club in Detroit"
"Now that's game, now I hope y'all listen cause"
"Signed or unsigned, MC's get dealt with"
"I've been too nice, too long"Embed
