9 ContributorsHeart of the City (Ain’t No Love) (MTV Unplugged) Lyrics
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov'
What's up? Cats all fed up cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young cats gettin' at me, young rappers spittin' at me
My homie Big predicted this thing exactly
"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"- gotta move carefully
Cause cat hate when you getting money like athletes
Young'ns ice-grilling me, ohh - you not feeling me?
Fine; it cost you nothing - pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for fronting
Sensitive thugs, they all need hugs
Damn little man I'm just trying do me
If the record's two mil you know I'm trying move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, yo I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waiting in the wing but I'm doing my thing
Where's the love?

(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
I said where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
You might also like
And then the Fugees gonna break up, now everyday I wake up
Somebody got something to say
What's all the fussing for? Because I'm grubbing more
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
They pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball
Now I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound boy
Look scrapper I got nephews to look after
I'm not looking at you dudes, I'm looking past ya
I thought I told you cats I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in '96
That I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz
I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham but the only thing running is numbers fam
Jigga held you down 6 summers; damn, where's the love?

(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
Ok I feel you ma, I said where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
Everybody let's take em to church
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city
Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
Then Richard Pryor gon' and burn up and Ike and Tina
Turner
Break up then I wake up to more bullsh
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this sh
Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talking to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
What you mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?
Nigga respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me sh - where's the love?

(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
I said where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no love in the heart of town)
Ain't no
I like that start again
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no ain't no ain't no love)
(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
(Ain't no)
Ain't no
Uh huh
Ain't no
(Ain't no love)
Everybody give it up for Jagwar Wright come on
That's all you baby that's all you
That's all Jay
Yeah rightEmbed
