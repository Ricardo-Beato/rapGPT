Hey, we made our own money
We made our own money
We made our own money
We made our own money
Fuck these niggas they ain't ballin'
We made our own money
Fuck these bitches they ain’t call
We made our own money
We made our own money
We made our own money

I print my own money, I get so much I can't be touched
I take that loud pack and then I stuff it in the dutch
Guess I'm a hood rat, me and my niggas moving up
My fingertips green from all these racks I’m countin' up
I'm on that Charlie Sheen, I got to win, I got to win
I'm ballin' like Kareem, I'm livin' in this life of sin
I sip a bunch of lean, I love it like it's juice and gin
Man fuck yo attitude, you 'bout to make me fuck your friend
I should've been ashamed, bitches fucking bitches too
I'm on a money train, I can't slow down, I just regroup
I had to make a change, it’s fuck Obama I'm the truth
Consider me a lion and they done let me out the zoo - whoo!

Hey, we made our own money
We made our own money
We made our own money
We made our own money
Fuck these niggas they ain't ballin'
We made our own money
Fuck these bitches they ain’t call
We made our own money
We made our own money
We made our own money

I push one button, the roof gon' go into the trunk
I'm John Gotti paid, now I'm going Donald Trump
I'm on a rampage, I had to climb up out a slump
I'm on like 5 geeks, and I'm talking to my 'migo
I told 'em I retired, I wanna thank them for the kilos
I can't never forget, what I went through for me to be here
On my metro, I was working, I was serving
I go cutthroat, when I'm down and I'm hurting
This a special moment, and we taking full advantage
100 dollar Future, I'll pass them out to all my family
I got this one bitch, I'll put her in the red bottoms
When you dumb rich, and you came from the bottom
Hey, we made our own money
We made our own money
We made our own money
We made our own money
Fuck these niggas they ain't ballin'
We made our own money
Fuck these bitches they ain’t call
We made our own money
We made our own money
We made our own money

Tell me the combination, I'm 'bout to fill it up with racks
I don’t take no vacations, I ain't got no time to relax
I'm flying up the Doja, 9-1-1, them the horses is inside the motor
When the money come, hater come and you keep some soldiers
They gonna knock a nigga off for you
Just to say they told you
I'mma get the office in the building to make my quota
I can't never have no feelings for bitches, they so rogue-ish
Trying to come to the club with a nigga to get exposure
I'mma buy shawty a bag, I feel sad for her
She can't come around a rich nigga rocking a Coach
I done beat a couple cases and did'n show up at court
Everything Versace, Medusa including my locs
(Outro)
Chiefin' on some good herb
Let’s go and fire up
Black Woodstock!2Embed
