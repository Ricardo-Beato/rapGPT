13 ContributorsAinâ€™t Even Know Lyrics
Phone going dumb
Bitches going bonkers
Going dumb
I pulled up with the thonkers

Phone going dumb (Yeah)
Bitches going bonkers (Yeah)
Baby I come from the sun (Yeah)
That's why I'm always Glo-ing (Yeah)
I pull up, these niggas run (Skrrt skrrt)
'Cause I'm always fucking blowing (Gang gang)
You know these niggas be my sons (Yeah)
How you know and I ain't even know it?

Ooh, I gets lots of ooh
I don't beef with you
I beef with no fool
Counting a lot of cool
Hundreds and they blue
White on my shoes
Fuck whatever you want to do
You get pussy, cool, you get money, cool
Pull them blue hundreds out my pocket
I pulled them up out the blue
Jumped up in the pool, your bitch in my room
She can't come to the pool, it's only for Glo
I got weed, I got aim, I got bills, I got drank
Where you from? Where you bang?
What you claim? Where you hang?
You wifed that bitch like she ain't fucking
But that bitch out here thoting like it ain't nothing
You might also like
Phone going dumb (Yeah)
Bitches going bonkers (Yeah)
Baby I come from the sun (Yeah)
That's why I'm always Glo-ing (Yeah)
I pull up, these niggas run (Skrrt skrrt)
'Cause I'm always fucking blowing (Gang gang)
You know these niggas be my sons (Yeah)
How you know and I ain't even know it?

Pull up, skrrt-skrrt, hop out, duh-duh
Ride a really-duh, really-duh
Shoot at foot-foot, medulla-dulla-duh
What I'm smoking, uh, what I'm sipping, uh, what I'm ridin', uh
Got your bitch last night, she hit me and said she riding, uh
She just want to waste all of my time and I ain't got enough
All I wanna do is count my money and get high as fuck
She gon' suck me up, then I pull up
Then she gotta go what I told her
Baby girl, I know I'm bipolar
I remember when I dreamed of riding Rovers
Now I'm shining from my wrist to my shoulders
Looking for your bitch, we be up in my mansion fucking

Phone going dumb (Yeah)
Bitches, going bonkers (Yeah)
Baby I come from the sun (Yeah)
That's why I'm always Glo-ing (Yeah)
I pull up, these niggas run (Skrrt skrrt)
'Cause I'm always fucking blowing (Gang gang)
You know these niggas be my sons (Yeah)
How you know and I ain't even know it? (How you know? Oh)1Embed
