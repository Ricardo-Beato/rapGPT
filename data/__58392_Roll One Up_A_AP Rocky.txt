1 ContributorTen Toes LyricsYeah
I stay down 10 toes
I stay down 10 toes
Yeah you know I stay down 10 toes
For all my bro’s that need me
All verified clothes now
I’m livin' my life in HD
And you know I
I be up I be up I be up
Roll one up for the ones that we lost
Yeah you know I stay down 10 toes
For all my bro’s that need me
All verified clothes now
I’m livin' my life in HD
And you know I
I be up I be up I be up
Roll one up for the ones that we lost
I swear I done lost so many brothers to this lifestyle
Bitches over brothers, that’s a rule that I can’t allow
Smell the gas when we walk through the room
We smokin' on that loud
Tell your boyfriend put the mic down
I’m comin for the crown
Fuck with me and imma make yo head rock
Pussy boy' no there ain’t goin' be no deadlock
I remember days when you said shit
Well that’s fine
'Cause now G sendin' 2 shooters to yo block
Simon says, fuck that' this a G song
Bullets make you dance
Like a boy was playin' hopscotch
Women and liquor
Yeah you know I can criss-cross
Auedemars or AP, yeah I want a big watch
You might also likeDo I want her
Or do I want the drink
Do I want her
Or is this all a dream
Man I swear I can’t even tell you
Hours on hours couped up in that stu
Workin' on my craft, searchin' things on youtube
Now I don’t give a fuck 'cause my money long
And I’m 'bout to go up with all my bro’s
'Bout to stay down 10 toes
Pushin' for the fame I suppose
Waitin' on them flights to the coast
I don’t care
'Bout what you doin' or what you say
You know my pockets growin' everyday
Fuck off, get that lame shit out my face
Yeah you know I stay down 10 toes
For all my bro’s that need me
All verified clothes now
I’m livin' my life in HD
And you know I
I be up I be up I be up
Roll one up for the ones that we lost
Yeah you know I stay down 10 toes
For all my bro’s that need me
All verified clothes now
I’m livin' my life in HD
And you know I
I be up I be up I be up
Roll one up for the ones that we lostEmbed
