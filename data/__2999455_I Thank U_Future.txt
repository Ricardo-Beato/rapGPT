33 ContributorsI Thank U Lyrics
Pluto
I can see it written all over your face
You doubted me from the first day
And it never went away
So I say this...

Girl I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I wanna thank you, I need to thank you
'Cause you made me a hustler

You not a part of my destiny, I tell ya
I was just servin' that fishscale in lobbies, yeah
This money comes faster than a mothafucka and it's obvious
Pour some more syrup on me
Throw some more dirt on me
But I'ma never give up
Top down in the wintertime, fuck the temperature
They got it heated, now we undefeated
Comin' so conceited, but I really need it
Eight figures, big tippers
Yacht party, a hundred strippers
Can't record it, it's confidential
Presidential, shout out Allen Temple
Fundamentals, keep it really simple
Richard Mille, I did for OGD
Save it up and send it OT
Makin' mills tryna OD
I'm in the Hills tryna find peace
These Bel Air neighbors so nosy
Black Draco, got me cozy
It was perfect timing like a Rollie

Girl I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I thank you, I thank you
'Cause you made me hustle
I wanna thank you, I need to thank you
You made me a hustler3Embed
