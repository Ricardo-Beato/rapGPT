I ain't playing no way, I got bands (hell you talking about)
No Shawty lo I'm the man (hell you talking about)
Them bricks right here wrapped in saran (hell you talking about)
Hundred bands my motherfucking pants (hell you talking about)
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout

You ain't talking about nothing, got a whole lot of birds
He ain't got that thing, he a mahfucking nerd
He a mahfuckin toilet, i’m a mahfuckin turd?
I'ma cash out on your bitch and she'll mahfucking slurp
Put my dick inside your drawers I'm all on
I'm a kush rushing working dog
Let my  tear down her wall
I'm a goddamn motherfucking boss
I got goddamn motherfucking sauce
She ain't not goddamn motherfucking shark
But she got goddamn motherfucking jaws
Alphabetical order, I got hoes in alphabetical order
I ain't scream but I got to slaughter her
And if the bitch bad I might daughter her, you dig
You might also like
I ain't playing no way, I got bands (hell you talking about)
No Shawty lo I'm the man (hell you talking about)
Them bricks right here wrapped in saran (hell you talking about)
Hundred bands my motherfucking pants (hell you talking about)
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout

OG gas bag I'm loaded down in cash
TIP trying to whip some forgis got them showing my ass
Two hundred on my dash I smash
Baby say she want cash for this
You ain't talking about nothing baby Longway'll pass
I'm the man in my town biting down like I'm Bobby Brown
I'm Molly Santana Brown, forty pointers in my rollie
Like Patrick Swayze there's a round
Tip toes I'll stay down
I ain't fucking around with your ass
Two guns I'm doubled down put the F&N on your ass
If you still talking about friendship I ain't fucking around
All that useless shit you a rooster now the hen around
No I don't want to hit that I smoking out the pound
Nah girl I don't want to hit that you a nat-nat now
I ain't playing no way, I got bands (hell you talking about)
No Shawty lo I'm the man (hell you talking about)
Them bricks right here wrapped in saran (hell you talking about)
Hundred bands my motherfucking pants (hell you talking about)
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout

Talking about pounds and bricks, Huh I speak no English
Talking about cooking and wrapping and flipping them chickens my nigga you trippin'
Nigga we all know you snitching
Thinking you gon' catch me slipping
I post on the block I'm selling the rock
I see the feds I'm jumping the fences
Back to the trap thinking like damn what the fuck these niggas plotting
I feel the trap spot is hot I look out the window I knew these niggas plotting
Helicopter's on top, SWATs around my house
No Young Joc but it’s going down

I ain't playing no way, I got bands (hell you talking about)
No Shawty lo I'm the man (hell you talking about)
Them bricks right here wrapped in saran (hell you talking about)
Hundred bands my motherfucking pants (hell you talking about)
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout, hell you talking bout
Hell you talking bout2Embed
