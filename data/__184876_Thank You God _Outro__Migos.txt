Runnin' through hoes and counting them M's
Living life high like Invader Zim (Yeah)
Live for today and pray for the next
I only see money, G's on my specs
I sin everyday just to get this success

The difference between us it's clear as it gets

So everyday I wake and thank him (Thank you)
From kickin' dem doors sellin' them babies
To walkin' through Jeff for a price of a baby (Yes)
I swear it's a blessing I never regret it (Yes)
This shit gets so hectic a nigga start stressing
The kush ain't helpin' (Gas)
Lookin' at my Smith & Wesson (Bow)
Looking for them vegetarians (Where)
I'm taking yo lettuce and celery (Cash)
