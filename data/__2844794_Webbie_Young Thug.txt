They don't wanna see you win
Nah, they want you always to lose (L, L, L)
They gon' always want you be stuck with them
They'll never wish you good luck on them
And they'll never wish bad luck either
And I don't know what the fuck to think either
Got a foreign car like a white beatle
Tcch, actin' like she like people
Knowin' they don't give two fucks if they're still here

My lil' niggas been tryna trap out of the vacant, yeah (Aw yeah)
Patek Phillipe, they got my wrist and they don't play with that (Patek Phillipe)
She been suckin' dick way before a nigga made it, yeah, yeah

Got off my ass and I got tired of waitin' (Tired of waitin')
Mama said, "You gonna make it, you gotta be patient" (Mama said, "You gonna make it")
Came out the hood, trap out the spot where they vacant (Trap out the spot)
Now we flyin' different places, fuckin' bitches, all different races
I did this shit that they thought I wouldn't do and I made it (Made it)
I was so down bad and so fucked up, couldn't make over eighty (For real)
I lost some friends, that was so fucked up
And I know that they hate me (Fuck, fuck)
Thugger, he gave me a chance and I had to take it (Gimme that)
(But I) used to trap on the block with the 380
Now when I pull up, they gotta pay me (Skrrt)
I came from nothing, born in the eighties (I came from nothing)
These niggas actors like Patrick Swayze
I gotta get it, I can't be lazy (I gotta get it)
Didn't have a dime so my mama crazy (Didn't have a dime)
Ran up a sack with Thugger, baby
Man, this shit so amazing
Yeah, new Patek Phillipe
Cost a hundred bands, man
Clear, with nothing' on it
Then I went and seen Elliott and iced that motherfucker out, you dig?
That's on Big Duck, that's on all 6, know I'm sayin'?
I got like a hundred-seventy, hundred-eighty thousand dollar watch, bro
And it glow up, um, gleen— green at night
And when the sun hit it on the plane
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I used to do this shit to maintain
'Til my—'til I started usin' fourteen percent of my brain
And that left me with five stars worth of stains, you dig?
