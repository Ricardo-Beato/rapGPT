3 ContributorsWTF?! Lyrics
Where the Flav? WTF
Payback music
Who the hell they be tellin' you?
What the F they be sellin' you?
Why the hell do you believe when you go where you leave?
W-T-F, W-T-F
W-T-F
What the fuck!?

I occupy this state of mind
Like I'm born a second time
The masses ask the question why
Them asses spend a life behind
On the M.I.C, the P.I.C
I'm against this prison industry
Where most of them look like me
Motherfuck the what, the Tea Party
They made you pay for education
And got no money, and got you waitin'
And tricks to keep the people fooled
And something in the food, my dude
About your future, and where you rank
And who you think, and who you thank
Behind the banks, and all those tanks
The New Whirl Odor is on the brink
A revolution stops the Feds
And count the homeless underfed
Sue the pharmaceutical off the meds
Leavin' people left for dead
Lookin' back 80 years instead
Simply blamed it on the reds
Pay close attention to what is said
But while you listen, you watch your head
You chase the money, you chase the fame
The human race is what they're playing
A game of life is what I'm sayin'
You split them up, you call 'em names
And at my age, if I can't teach
I shouldn't even open my mouth to speak
And talkin' loud and sayin' nothing
And frontin' like they doing somethin'
Feel the people, heal the people
Power goes out to the people
18 and 35 is grown
Can't afford to leave the home
Can't afford to buy a home
Can't afford to keep a home
Boarded up, foreclosed cribs
Based on what ya bank did
Yet see these guys advertise to poor for clothes
The doors are closed
They slam the doors on your nose
Who the hell is telling you?
What the hell they selling you?
And why the hell do you believe?
And where we headed when we leave?
W-T, What the f-?
You might also like
What the f-
What the f-
What the f-
What the fu- (uh)
What the fu- (yeah)
What the fuck (uh, what)
(Yeah) What the fuck!

From Barack Obama to Flavor Flav
We will both be a first 'til we get to our grave
I'm the first hype man in music, he's the first black President
He's the first black resident to ever become President
Free your mind, your ass will follow
Flavor Flav all the way to the Apollo
Freeport LI to LA
Throw a Frito Lay off the dock to the bay
You wanna know why a kid goes to school
And in his book-bag he carries a tool?
Because he's trying to be like his idols in the streets
Gang warfare to the raw fare
Don't even try to go up there
Penalties that you can't bear
You lose your sight, your ass can't hear
It weighs so much, it'll crush your life
Don't play with God, He gave you life
The last man standing, he holds to behold
His weight in stature, his weight in gold
What goes in your wash comes out in your rinse
Back down so tight that you call it condensed
Can't stand the pressure, can't stand the pain
My life is so dry, I wish it would rain
Just like The Temptations, not just the singing group
I'm here to tell you now so don't ignore the scoop
I've been in this rap game for 25 years
If we made the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
We deserve our cheers
To what we fought the power, to Who Stole the Soul?
Brothers Gonna Work It Out from the ground we hold
God says to man, "I'ma let you live"
God says to man, "I'ma let you live"
God says to man, "I'ma give you power
Not for the intent to misuse your power"
If you wanna dance, you gotta play the band
People die by other hands
The innocent, the Ku Klux Klan
Iraq, and Iran, and Afghanistan
They go to war, they don't come back
The note comes home, "Killed In Attack"
All the medals from Fort Bragg
Collected by a widow along with the flag
41-Gun salute, 4 jets in the air
Now that's going out of style
Your contribution was fear
What you reap is what you sow
A man got killed for what he know
If you wanna be an asshole and get a good wife
Stay the fuck offa Skype and don't believe the hype
