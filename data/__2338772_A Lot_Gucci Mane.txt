6 ContributorsA Lot Lyrics
Shoutout to  !
Shout to V12
Trendsetter Six! (Gangsta!)
Shoutout to Willie the Kid!
DJ Drama fuck these niggas up!

My time piece custom
Tennis shoes custom
90 bricks just passed customs
I ain't even touched 'em, may not even bust 'em
Any rapper challenge me, verbal race dust 'em
I guess you not accustomed
You got on a costume, acting like a ba-boon
Slap you with a barstool, like 4-Set rush him
Everybody jumped him
Gucci Mane so bossed up don't make me get to hush him
God can only judge me, Lord can only judge him
He don't have a pulse so guess somebody stuck him
Gucci got a fly mouth, somebody punch 'em
Last nigga tried that head look like a pumpkin
I don't give a fuck if you fucks don't give a fuck
You might also like
How many cars do you got? (A lot)
How many times have you popped ya Glock? (A lot)
How many times have you cruised the block? (A lot)
How many haters do you think I got? (A lot)
How many times am I talked about? (A lot)
How much money do you think I got? (A lot)
How many more men might get shot? (A lot)
How many more men might get shot? (A lot)

Gucci got an arsenal
Heard he ride with carbon-15s with grenade launchers on 'em
Tech nine with the cool it on it
If you wanna take it off me, I'll put all my jewelry on it
Take it, Fuck, Replace it, Ain't no need to put insurance on it
Homie got an eye problem, momma need insurance on him
Like my nigga Waka Flocka, don't wanna bag of money
Sniper rifle shoot yo pussy ass from around the corner
I be riding in my Lamborghini ('Ghini) sexing women
Thinking back, when I was in cutlass with no air condition
This track is a car collision
Think I got a heart condition
Clique got so much jewelry on, leave yo ass with blurry vision
Honestly, I pay so much money I can't wear True Religion
Y'all niggas be truly snitching
Stop asking 'bout Uncle Russel
You niggas no competition
It's Gucci, it's Gucci

Gucci Mane phenomenon
Napkins with three numbers on 'em
Fucking with a rubber on
Yellow lamb, yellow blunt
Me and Monnie got a blunt
You and rats don't get along
No you cannot have a loan right now 'cause I'm never home
Pictures on my camera phone, make a nigga wanna rap
Wanna be like Gucci Mane, Wanna live off in the trap
No this ain't the life until you think before you enter
Hungry ass a nigga had the singles out in Libra
Make you a believer when you see me with the eagle
Street sweeper shootin' people 'cause they think they deeper
Deeper then this rap shit dead people can't type
Blind mind can't see Gucci knock your head off out
