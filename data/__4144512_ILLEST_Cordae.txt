7 ContributorsILLEST Lyrics
Yo, yo, yo
Haha
It's due time
I'm the illest so there's that, haha
Yeah

New rap phenomenon
Hungry like it's Ramadan
Blowing up, atomic bombs
And Columbine could not respond
Always got a lot of rhymes
Make it cuz I gotta grind
While my team is always fucking winning like we got LeBron
Killing in this rap game
Most of y'all are whack, lame
Won't stop rapping, until I fucking crack fame
Man, I've been passing
Winning is my last name
Snakes in the grass, cuz all the fucking rats came
Coming for my jack cheddar
Where I'm from, they jack cheddar
Hating cuz I rap better
Ski mask, black sweaters
Coming for your father, though
All down, dominos
Vamanos, mama knows
In the room, not a soul
Shower's blowing, gotta go
Feeling like it's '94
Kicking door on shawties, blow
All the sounds your bouta know
Shit, I hear every day
Niggas pushing heavy weight
Grandma on that section eight
She praying for better days
Was another optional, synopsis, I'm the hottest, no
Rappers is a problem, oh
It's till I'm dead, I got it so
Tell me how you gon' stop this motherfucker
Weight of the world on my shoulders but I squat that motherfucker
You might also like
Let me show them how to do this
And listen to this music
Hip Hop at its truest
Leaving rappers clueless
I'm the illest motherfucker alive, so let me tell them
I'm the illest motherfucker alive, so let me tell them
Let me show them how to do this
And listen to this music
Hip Hop at its truest
Leaving rappers clueless
I'm the illest motherfucker alive, so let me show them
I'm the illest motherfucker alive, so let me tell them that

It's that boom bap, who's that
New cat, bringing back that true rap
Who's at, foot action, when you get your shoes snatched
And tops come off, like it's loose caps
So wonder why niggas pop pills and the blue caps
So that's old rap. so whack
No rules, feel the black load
Leaving like fat souls, asshole
That's me, great like Gatsby
Get cheddar, stack cheese
All about that green
What we live for and die for
Why mamas cry for
Teams on that trifold
Dad don't know why though
This is who I do this for
Fifteen with a funeral
In a struggle, losing hope
Not knowing where you can go
Two options, choose wisely, dead or in jail
Or as Heaven to hell
But I better excel cuz I'm clever as hell
And you never can tell
The illest motherfucker and forever prevail
Let me show them how to do this
And listen to this music
Hip Hop at its truest
Leaving rappers clueless
I'm the illest motherfucker alive, so let me tell them
I'm the illest motherfucker alive, so let me tell them
Let me show them how to do this
And listen to this music
Hip Hop at its truest
Leaving rappers clueless
I'm the illest motherfucker alive, so let me show them
I'm the illest motherfucker alive, so let me tell them that1Embed
