If you want to get with a grown man
You can holla at Young Weezy
If he doesn't answer his cell phone I ain't there

So if you wanna get with a grown man
All you gotta do is holla at these
Flyest niggas at the party
Checking out six in the morning
I say six in the morning
I said six in the morning
A six in the morning
Six in the checking out
Six in the morning
Six in the

Now we can't do the hotel nor the motel
Nor the Holiday Inn
Plus if that clerk gon tell my wife
Oh well, then she'll tell her friends
