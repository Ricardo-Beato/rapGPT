9 ContributorsTriple Threat Lyrics
(Yeah)
I'ma make you dance, you dance, I'm a triple threat
I'ma make you boun-boun-bounce, so hard until you break your neck
I'ma keep it crunk, and crunk, I'm a space cadet
Ba-bass, hit-hit-hit so hard-hard that you feel it in your chest
Mi-mi-Missy and I, and I, we we music's best
Ten years later watch the dynamic d-du-du' reconnect
A hundred and twenty million sold, sold, and them niggas back
I'd like to see how many niggas out there-there that can do-do that
I say...

Missy and I throw it up, keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up, keep a liter in our cup
Keep a liter in our cup, we keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up, we keep a liter in our cup
Keep a liter in our cup, we keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up, we keep a liter in our cup
Keep a liter in, we keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up

I got that one liter, two liter, in my cup, margarita
Roll up in my two-seater, I'm a pretty diva, call me se√±orita
Have you seen a new Medina I don't do grass but I'm a misdemeanour
I'm so fresh out front the cleaners
Triple threat: rap, dance, and I'm a singer
Get the finger, middle finger, me and Timbaland the new Ike and Tina
Tag team ya, right up in ya, hits like Venus and Serena
Timby and I throw it up, whatever we do it will blow up
He so hot so popular, I told ya'll, ya'll can't mess with us
You might also like
Missy and I throw it up, keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up, keep a liter in our cup
Keep a liter in our cup, we keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up, we keep a liter in our cup
Keep a liter in our cup, we keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up, we keep a liter in our cup
Keep a liter in, we keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up

(Let's go!)
Guess who back, yep I'm the best
I'm that chick, 'cause I'm a triple threat
Two fifty mill and who can top that
I slap who ever said I'm irrelevant
Got them pissed and mad and upset
Music dead we make it resurrect
Watch our step you better come correct
If you go in such you're gonna lose your bet
Up the bet and tell me who's next
Nasty flow, call it triple X
Got my drink I'm sipping on that
Ya'll faker than some fake Rolex
Timby and I throw it up, whatever we drink sho' to blow up
See this liter in our cup
We VIP when we roll up
Missy and I throw it up, keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up, keep a liter in our cup
Keep a liter in our cup, we keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up, we keep a liter in our cup
Keep a liter in our cup, we keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it up, we keep a liter in our cup
Keep a liter in, we keep a liter in our cup
Missy and I throw it upEmbed
