God
Come in, God
God, come in, God
Damn, you're a girl? Wow
I guess the reason I'm talkin' to you tonight is
Because I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' and
And I consider myself a pretty cool guy
And I've never cheated on any of my girlfriends
Well, well, except that one little time in Japan, but
That was just some head, and head don't count, right?
Ah, thanks God, I knew you'd understand
Well, I just feel like
Well, to be honest with you
God, I just need a sweet bitch
You know somebody not too
Not too fast, but not too slow
'Cause I don't have it all my damn self
And life ain't easy
You know, you just want somebody by your side
To help smooth that thang out, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
And at this point, I mean, I'm not bein' picky
She doesn't even have to have a big ol' ass, you know?
Just something well proportioned to her body
You know, a nice little tail, you know?
What? You say you, you say you found somebody?
Is she cute? So when do I get to meet her?
Oh God, you're the greatest
Well, I guess I'll talk to you later
Amen
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
