What you thought it was nigga I'm the man 'round here
Hands down man down by my grandma crib
On the east
Riding 'round don’t be slipping
Don’t Blood me cuz whole Long Beach Cripping
No cease
Firing I’m fired up tripping
In A NY fleece wasn't playing no Biggie
WC and Trey D keep shit crippy
No boot camp clicking we was food stamp flipping
Tryna eat
1st of the month re'd up 15th
Quarter punch ice cream trucks police
Stay tryna lock niggas up
Foes wacking out the set then we shot niggas up
No peace
No love not not clicking up
Swapmeet whites and a Glock in the trunk
OG's tryna tell a nigga bout the game
But it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same on me

Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong

Well I was born by the river not baptized in it
Loose lips sink ships who capsize quicker
Not we
Stay low-key no snitching
Since soul glo dripping and the sherm stick dipping
Tread light
Snakes gone bite on sight
Niggas battle with the judge like the gavel got a grudge
Face life
Still fight never been a punk
Chase dough hoe never get enough lemme tell you bout the flocks
Looking for the tents mama gotta pay the rent
Kicking in the back door tell me where it is
Come up out the safe or its coming out the clip
And I don't hesitate washing money like the sins
Attention getters hit detention centers
Before I break the bank, boy ill break and enter
Both ears to the streets listen in a drought
Cause when money coming niggas get to showing out

When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong7Embed
