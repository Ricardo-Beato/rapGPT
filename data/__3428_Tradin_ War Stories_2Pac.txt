A military mind, nigga (Yeah, the homies just sittin' around)
A military mind mean money (You knahmean? Talkin' that shit)
A criminal grind, nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know

We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin' hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin' up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
And fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines, my father figure
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Henceforth, we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of my niggas strapped sippin' on 'Gnac
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin' 'til I die, these streets got me cravin' thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
Fat as that ass that honey shakin'

My niggas tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories

I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin' and shit
But I was just a younger nigga, gettin' older and lovin' this shit
But what was I doin' in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin' termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all
These playa hatin' niggas position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat, people, I'm tryna tell you

Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin' greenery
Considered a BG, but I'm off in this game something deeply
My eyes only see G's, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And wide open, to ridin' and smokin'
Collide with foes in the worst place
Y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us, in the first place
Y'all real OGs, droppin' game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk 'cause
Y'all be the next in the long line of war stories
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

I breaks them off with this gangster war story tale
Stacking loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
When I slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumping insane
Call me Bo Loc Major Pain, gun-slang and moving 'caine
I be the nigga that pulling a trigger and dumping the hot ones up in your brain
More bigger balls than RuPaul, Thug Life fade 'em all
We bucks that ass up against the wall, up against a son of a man call
We bucks them down on the way to the ground, ain't nothin' but the hog in me
Plus, stompin' steel toed, killin' up ho's and keep mobbin' G
It ain't no calling the funk off, now dumping out bucks with a sawed off
Blast they dirty-ass drawers off and have them bitch niggas hauled off

We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories
My whole family been raised on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothin' on this Earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscin', and catchin' flashbacks when niggas ran up in my house and I was too young to try to blast back
What happened then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they livin' somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad since ways back
And now I'm sittin', holdin' in anger because my parents missin'
Thuggin' immortal, went got some war stories for you

Now look at me, straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck 'cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
'Cause the murderous tendencies in my mind can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would you try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got you on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin' to God as your life goes back and forth
