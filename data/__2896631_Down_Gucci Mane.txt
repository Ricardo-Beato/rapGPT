6 ContributorsDown Lyrics
It was the week before Christmas and all through the traps
Real street niggas was tired of hearing all them bullshit raps

Every time I drop my top (21), bitches on my cock
Yeah I'm from the block, bitch I keep a Glock
Shoot at your top, Free the Wop (21)
Your bitch fuck the gang, and I know that you hating (I know that you hating Bow!)
Rolex flooded diamonds stainless
Red bottoms on my lady (21 21 21 21)
Now she wanna have my babies (My babies)
Slaughter king, I'm the slaughter king (Slaughter you know that)
All I do is slaughter things
High carrots in my pinky ring (21)
Glock 40 in my new Jeans, bitch I bang for the red team (21)
Her pussy bad but the head mean

Drop my top at any time cause I can't let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae
Drop my top at any time cause I can't let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae
Drop my top at any time this button here let it down bae
Drop my top at any time that boy gon' let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae
Drop my top at any time cause I can't let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae
You might also like
Drop my top at any time, anytime, any state, any place, anyway
Any kinda car you got I got, any type of bitch you pull up on
Any type of bitch you got I fuck
Gucci Mane, I love to ball
Closet hanging like a shopping mall
Tell the truth baby I don't need no top at all
I told her get lil man to get that bitch to chop it off
Drop it off, drop it off

Drop my top at any time cause I can't let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae
Drop my top at any time cause I can't let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae
Drop my top at any time this button here let it down bae
Drop my top at any time that boy gon' let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae
Drop my top at any time cause I can't let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae

Drop my top in the summer time
Say you  but not mines
Heels go for the 23, call it Jumpman make it jump line
How you pussies riding round with straps
And you lil niggas ain't pop shit
Turn the roof to convertible off I top shit
Roof off, and I drop shit
Savage Life with 21  21
Had 50 bags when I was 21
Got a foreign bitch she  only 21
All black bitch, Bruce Wayne
Street nigga like Gucci Mane
With a  Like Pootie Tang
The game choose me I ain't choose the game
Say my  Yellow Tesla
These diamonds same color
She talking money I got a lot
She drop her panties when I drop the top
Drop my top at any time cause I can't let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae
Drop my top at any time cause I can't let you down
Drop my top at any time this button here let it down bae
Drop my top at any time this button here let it down bae
Drop my top at any time that boy gon' let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down bae
Drop my top at any time cause I can't let you down
Drop my top at any time this button let it down baeEmbed
