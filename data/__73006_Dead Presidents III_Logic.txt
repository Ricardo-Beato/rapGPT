("Dead Presidents III," not to be confused with "Growing Pains III")
"Logic this," "Logic that,"
"Logic sick," "Logic wack"
Logic just don't give a fuck
RattPack

So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it, just cease
Got it, capiche? This is my house, you fuckers just lease
Waitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest
Black and white like a nun
These up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn
So follow your father like an apostle
Paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil
Never knowing what's gon' follow
However we never wallow in our sorrow
Just pray for tomorrow
At times my heart could be hollow
Emotions forced to be swallowed
While neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo
This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you
So I'm trying to find her
One moment she'll love you then swallow
You whole like an anaconda
The bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky
I'ma dominate the world like my name is Brain
Spit flame like propane
Bitches I overcame you know the name
Ink in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page
To numb the pain like Novocaine, motherfucker

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

Allow me to kill it off the brake like no traffic
Murderin' every demographic
Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic
Grip the mic to set the example
While all these muh-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples
Constant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die
Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I
But we persevere force feed enemies truth serum
We want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased
In your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest
Bustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it
I get from point A to point B by keeping it G
Ain't no killer but don't push me
If you grab the heat, you a pussy
Knuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel
I have not a single enemy
Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, in they mind
'Cause I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
And when it comes to dames I catch planes
They catch feelings
Haters keep my name in they mouth like fillings
High as the ceiling
Y'all really don't know who your dealing with now
Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
Thankful for every breath I'm givin'
Fuck social division
On the road to success and there ain't no time for collision
People ask "how you get your flow so amazing"
To which I reply "I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions"
Haters takin' shots but they never graze him
Now if pro is the opposite of con
What's the opposite of progress?
I love my country but that shit a mess
Grew up on section 8, I can attest
And now they wonder why I claim that I'm the fucking best
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Now if I don't believe it y'all won't perceive it
Now run it back and retrieve it
Till you receive it in your motherfuckin' mind
Only 22 but I feel like I'm 99
Back in 1999, that's when I began to rhyme
Surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine
Daddy was smoking crack, I was raised by a single mom
Fasting every night I ain't talking bout no Ramadan
I was poor as fuck me and my mama, we didn't have a dime
At 16, the school system dismissed him and wished him well
But my mama never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?
So I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own
I left home at 17
Shortly after my mama got stabbed by fucking around in the streets
But she still breathin' which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving
So many rappers biting me you would think they was teething
And now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story52Embed
