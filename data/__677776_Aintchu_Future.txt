(Zaytoven)
Yeah, huh?
Huh, huh

You the lil' one got that whole thing, ain't you?
You got them boys around the corner runnin' wild on that molly, ain't you?
You pourin' up, your cup dirty, ain't you?
You got that mud inside your syrup, you 'bout to pour right up now, ain't you?
I bet a thousand on a thousand, ain't you?
You sippin' mud, on that dirty, ain't you?
You ready to ride on these niggas, ain't you?
You put designer on your eyes, ain't you?
You take the nine out them pies, ain't you?

You had that screen door swinging open, you was servin' all them dimes, ain't you?
You loaded up, you got that iron, ain't you? (Ain't you?)
You snappin' chats, you on that Vine, ain't you? (Ain't you?)
You tryna fuck her 'cause she fine, ain't you? (Ain't you?)
You pull up West, in LA buckin' at boy
You can't get caught, you tryna sell the wrong kind, ain't you? (Finesse)
You sell that yay, you 'bout to go and serve your uncle, ain't you? (Ain't you?)
Done seen that ghetto turn a nigga to a beast, yeah (Yeah)
We on that kush, yeah, poured up on some drank, yeah

You put designer on your eyes, ain't you? (I fuck with you, huh?)
You take the nine out them pies, ain't you? (Rich Gang)

You that little nigga do the murders, ain't you?
You double cuppin' 'cause you want us to know you be sippin' syrup, ain't you?
You in them streets and you ain't scared, ain't you?
Your family straight if you get killed in the city, 'cause you insured, ain't you?

Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand, that ain't nothin'

All that, you know what I'm sayin'?12Embed
