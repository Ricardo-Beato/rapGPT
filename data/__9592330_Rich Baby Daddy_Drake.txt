Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (Ho)
Hands on your knees (Ho), hands on your knees (Ow)
Shake that ass for Drake (Yup), now, shake that ass for me
Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake (Yeah), now, shake that ass for me

Ayy, I still got some love deep inside of me
No need to lie to me, I know you got a guy
He's not a guy to me
Just say goodbye to him, then take the ride to mе, ride to me
I still got some lovе deep inside of me
Please drag it out of me
You just might
Just might get that G-Wagon out of me
Please drag it out of me, please drag it out
Rollie gang, patty gang, rich baby daddy gang
I'm with Red like I'm at a Cincinnati game
Hood bitch, tat her gang 'fore she tat her name
Real bitch, held me down 'fore I had a name
Heard there's money on my head, what is that to me?
I put a hundred bands on him, he put a rack on me
We from two different worlds, but it's a match to me
The bend it over only time she turn her back on me (For real)

Your man so good and you deserve that in your suffering
I need a dick and conversation, can you cover me?
I had a feeling this is more than what we both say
I had a feeling this is more than a feeling
I can't let you get away
Feels good, but it can't be love
Ain't a damn thing that I do
Ain't a damn thing, oh

Bend that ass over (Ooh), let that coochie breathe (Ooh)
Shake that ass, bitch (Ooh), hands on your knees (Ooh)
Hands on your knees (All been there), hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake (Uh), now, shake that ass for me
Bend that ass over (Yeah), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch (Yeah), hands on your knees (Hands on your)
Hands on your knees (Hands on your), hands on your knees (Yeah)
Shake that ass for Drake, now, shake that ass for me (Shake, shake, shake)
You like my voice, I turn you on
Red weave, it match my thong
He heard about me, know my song
I drive him crazy, can't leave me 'lone
Foreign trucks, I pull up
Thirty inches to my butt
Nails done, I'm fine as fuck
Niggas tryna see what's up

I'm lucky
I'm lucky
I'm lucky
I'm lucky

Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (Ho)
Hands on your knees (Ho), hands on your knees (Ow)

Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake (Yeah), now, shake that ass for me

You know the root of it
You know the lies and you know the truth of it
I see the future and I can see you in it
Girl, I'm not stupid, so don't play no stupid shit
I swear, poppin' my shit come with consequences
Post nut clarity, I came to my senses
I knew it was love when it started as a friendship
Askin' 'bout a baby, we should probably get a Frenchie
And take care of the dog
Take care of the dog
Until the dog days are over
The dog days are done
And you know I'm the one, I'm the one
The dog days are over, dog days are done
And you know I'm—

We was fuckin' night after night, I'll change your life
You ain't even know how to suck it right, I taught you right
You ain't even heard of Grace Bay 'til I bought the flight
You ain't even know how cold you was 'til I bought you ice
You can't even look at him the same, we a different type
You just text me trippin', I reply, "Have a safe flight"
Wanna stick around for the ride, baby, hol' on tight5Embed
