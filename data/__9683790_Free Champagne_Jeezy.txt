J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
Uh-huh (Uh-huh)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
Yeah (Yeah)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
(Free champagne tomorrow)

I done balled with the best, nigga, and shot at the rest
I been prayin' and studyin', so I'm up for the best
Escapin' the luxury, that's how I deal with the stress
Who better than you? Them niggas know you the best
Take a look in the mirror, now you know what you facin'
Yeah, you fightin' the world, no more procrastination
You got beef with your hood? Well, I got beef with the nation
And they ain't comin' to save us, so why the fuck is you patient?
This the unapologetic real mе
I'm just sayin' what you feel, I know you niggas feel me
You a whole ass man, you love thеm niggas to pieces
They gon' suck all your blood before you find out they leeches
Put a knife in your back, then put a slug in your front
Put your focus on focus, shit change your life in a month
You might also like
Change the channel, time to change the program
You can have a hundred Rollies, time waits for no man, yeah

Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
Uh-huh (Uh-huh)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
Yeah (Yeah)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
(Free champagne tomorrow)

Niggas actin' like they got all the time in the world
How you gon' explain that to your lil' girl?
Daddy was on bullshit, he wasn't about his grip
Lived his whole life and he didn't leave her shit
Sad thing about it, his daddy did the same thing
When you ain't got shit, nigga, what's to maintain?
As I chill, nigga, you better go out here and get it
One life to live, you better go out here and live it
Fuck the opposition, better ball on them bitches
You know them niggas watchin', better smile in them pictures
Time to press pause, better stall on them bitches
That Jeff Bezos shit, we need all of them riches
The man in the mirror, the one that's holdin' you back
This entrepreneur shit, it's bigger than trap
Change the channel, time to change the program
You can have a hundred Rollies, time waits for no man, yeah

Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
Uh-huh (Uh-huh)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
Yeah (Yeah)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
(Free champagne tomorrow)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
Uh-huh (Uh-huh)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
Yeah (Yeah)
Free champagne tomorrow ('Morrow)
(Free champagne tomorrow)Embed
