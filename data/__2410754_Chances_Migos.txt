24 ContributorsChances Lyrics
Chances
I done took a whole lotta chances
Romantic
I fuck her, I ain't tryna be romantic
Dancing
I just left the jeweler diamonds dancing
Damage
Try to take it my chopper do damage
Panic
Hold that dope down lil bitch bae don't panic
Fancy
I ain't got no time if you fancy
Frantic
I used to have J's going frantic
Outstanding
Looking at my life right now, this shit outstanding

I took a whole lot of chances
Reminiscing in my mansion
Thinking back then in the bando I put the dope in her panties
Remember back then on the nawf side
Fifty bands in the suitcase
Free my big brother Kobe
That's the only nigga that threw me the 10k
We were so hot we could sizzle
Now I'm so cold like a blizzard
You think my life was a riddle
Till I send my niggas go and get them
I do this shit for my dawgs
We used to kick doors and all
Now we fuck hoes and ball
Now we fuck hoes and ball
You don't understand it
I took all these chances
That's why I move all my niggas to my fucking mansion
We came up from nothing, jugg a cutie, smoke a onion
We came a long way from the bando smelling like funyuns

Advancement
Money keep coming on in, I'ma buy me an Aston
Outstanding
Look at my diamonds, they dancing
Give me compliments on my fashion
Cum on her face, on her lashes
Kick that bitch out of my mansion
Them choppers come then it get drastic
Eat out your gut then we turn you to ashes
I'm getting money, my kids gotta eat
Spend fifty thou' on my watch, it ain't cheap
You couldn't walk a mile in my motherfucking feet
Wanna get out so I took the damn plea
I took a chance
You told on your man
Got a bitch up in France
Call my phone when she land
She in love with my cash
Treat that bitch like a nat
Send my shooters attack
I can't never go back
Act a fool with the gat
Christian Louboutin don't match
Grab the forty, blow your hat
But don’t nobody know bout that
(Hold that down)

Outstanding
Looking at my life right now, this shit outstanding

Take a look at my life, you spazzing
I’m the one that told them 'bout the fashion
Dabbin', cup nasty, that plastic, you can’t have it
Block on fire like a dragon
No question when police be asking
Not having, nigga you fasting
I do this rap shit with passion
Young nigga taking them chances
Running with plays like I’m calling Madden
Remember when I wasn't havin'
Like I got it, I call that shit below average
Now I make a movie Great Gatsby
Remember they didn’t want to call me Takeoff
Like instead of Ali they say Cassius
Now look at them, got 'em embarrassed
Chances, only got one shot, gotta get to the top
And niggas can’t stand it
These bitches gone still drop they panties
All the advances when you get chances
Panic, my pinky ring it do damage
Smell like a pound while on campus
They hated us so they banned us
Chances
I done took a whole lotta chances
Romantic
I fuck her, I ain't tryna be romantic
Dancing
I just left the jeweler diamonds dancing
Damage
Try to take it my chopper do damage
Panic
Hold that dope down lil bitch bae don't panic
