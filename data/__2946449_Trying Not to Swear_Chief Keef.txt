13 ContributorsTrying Not to Swear Lyrics
Man I miss standin' on the block
Totin' on the Glocks
Slidin' on the opps
Screamin' free the guys
In general pop
Bitch, I move fast
She gave me good top
Told that bitch stop
You want smoke, what's up?
Get your ass scuffed
I'm countin' green bucks
Boy, you smokin' huff
Where is the bus?
I need to get some stuff
The life I'm livin' rough
I'm tryin' not to cuss

Stackin' the mula, to hit my jeweler
You a unlicensed mover
You still can't move us
Got all of my ice on
They say it's too much
What's under this Hermes?
It's a slick the ruler
You gotta show us
You do not know us
Niggas is snitchin'
They paper showed us
Thew me in rehab
Well I'm still not sober
What is your goals?
You do not know
I'm sippin' drank 'til it put me to sleep
Countin' all this money, killed the thief in me
Ain't shit changed, still got beef in me
I can fuck all of the women that were teachin' me
You might also like
Man I miss standin' on the block
Totin' on the Glocks
Slidin' on the opps
Screamin' free the guys
In general pop
Bitch, I move fast
She gave me good top
Told that bitch stop
You want smoke, what's up?
Get your ass scuffed
I'm countin' green bucks
Boy, you smokin' huff
Where is the bus?
I need to get some stuff
The life I'm livin' rough
I'm tryin' not to cuss

Bitch, I'm a dog, they can't tame me
The life that I live probably changed me
Up for ten days 'cause I can't sleep
A whole bunch of real niggas trained me
Your own dogs will cross you man, it can't be
The diamonds in my ear givin' me brain freeze
We don't count the same cash or smoke the same weed
Standin' on this foreign, I bleed like Rick James bleed
I'm stuck in the cheese, it's gettin' real steep
The diamonds on my neck, remind me of my jeep
My waist is LV, double Gs on my jeans
Cream, get the money, dollar dollar ching ching
Man I miss standin' on the block
Totin' on the Glocks
Slidin' on the opps
Screamin' free the guys
In general pop
Bitch, I move fast
She gave me good top
Told that bitch stop
You want smoke, what's up?
Get your ass scuffed
I'm countin' green bucks
Boy, you smokin' huff
Where is the bus?
I need to get some stuff
The life I'm livin' rough
I'm tryin' not to cussEmbed
