29 ContributorsI Be U Lyrics
Thinkin' how you would be thinkin', I'm feeling you close
I'm dreamin' how you would be dreamin' and hoping you over
I give what you give and I never back out of decisions
I feel what you feel and I'm hoping and prayin' and willing
I'm nervous, you nervous
You drinkin', I'm drinkin'; we rockin'
I'm talkin', you talkin'
I'm in it, you in it; no stopping
I'm quiet, you quiet
We sit here, we looking in silence

I'll be there I'll be there I'll be
I'll be there I'll be there I'll be
I be you baby
I be you baby
I be you baby
And I might can't do, what you do
But I'll be, I said I'll be there

You workin,' I'm workin'
I get that coffin and kill that pussy in Venice
Yeah, You sweatin', I'm sweatin'
We overdoing the mollys, won't let us finish
Yeah, I need it, you need it
And we both fiendin', I guess that's our agreement
I'm naked, you naked
And neither one of us tryna look for a blanket
Got questions on questions about what answers, I know
Because when we're drinkin'
Your spirit, my spirit illuminates through our bodies
I feel we whole
Eye contact exchanging favors, I guess it's better you know me

[I'll be there I'll be there I'll be
I'll be there I'll be there I'll be]
[I be you baby
[I be you baby
[I be you baby
[And I might can't do, what you do
But I'll be, I said I'll be there]

I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
I be you baby, I see you baby
I see you in the morning, I see you in the evening
I see you in the nighttime when I thought I was creepin'
I see you baby
I'll be you baby
And I was sittin' at home lonely wishing you was here
Now I'm thinkin' to myself "Why I ain't already leave yet?"
I see you baby
I'll be you baby
I see you in the morning, I see you in the evening
I see you in the nighttime when I thought I was creepin'
I see you baby15Embed
