10 ContributorsLovely Lyrics
I love myself I love what I am I love who I is I love Weezy
Lil girl your man your damn kids love Weezy
You gotta love the nigga just because other nigga
And I don't love other niggas But I love other niggas bitches
I love 20-inches on everything I sit in
I love my nappy hair I love the shit I wear
You gotta love the squad-ad girl
If she ain't giving love to the whole squad-ad get outta here
You people love the shit I pop in your ear
You gon love the shit I do to hip-hop this year
You gonna love when I bring it back to the block this year
I represent the Biggie and 'Pac era; you gotta love me
That I know ma love me just cause I got a lot of money
But I love that girl too, but I love that girl too
I let y'all know me and I would love to know you now come on

Everything that I love in this world
Has gotta be the greatest thing in this world if I love it cause, I love this, I love that, I love y'all because
Everything in this world is just love

You love to live that big dog life
You love to live just like a young'n Weezy by here
And I love to see you do so I love my Coupe blow on them deuce-o's
I love a cute ho and you probably love her all right, girl
He probably love you all your life I love you all night, girl I love an all white pearls
Six with the two pipes barrel kit I love to get it cracking in your girl lips
I love to sip from bill I love to go hard purp-pill
You love that I'm a star and got that work still
Don't get it fucked because I love to work still
And you won't love how the hurt feel
How getting murked feel And I love how getting hurt feel I know you love I got some of it on your shirt ee-yew I need to treat you
As a matter fact I love to cheat you
Don't call me cool Hey, you love me and I love to love you
