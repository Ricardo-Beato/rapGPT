4 ContributorsGeorgia Lyrics
This is what's happenin'

Them pretty things got me across the border (Uh)
Before they go in Bentleys on the way to Georgia
Got my Migo gang and that comes with the charger
He said it's sixty-five, that's only 'cause it's Georgia (Gangsta Grillz, shoutout to Russell Raw)
She want to pick the bridge, they on their way to Georgia
And I'ma sell them shits in East Atlanta Georgia (Seven Valley, it's Gucci)
That's if the plug don't get behind that truck and trade (It's Gucci, baby, it's So Icy time)
Lord please, let me and Ye get back to Georgia (It's Gangsta Grillz)

Ten bands on triple, these niggas want to triple
Go watch yellow triple, go whine (Huh)
Polo, Polo, slippers on me
And my mama keep trippin' cause I'm selling cocaine (Huh)
Came in the game with an ounce of game
But I lost three times trying to work the flame
I part the thing, then I worked the train
Jumped off the train, then sold the 'caine
I did the thing, I can't complain
But sometimes things seem kinda strange
Summer lost her grandma too, sometimes I gained that Aa-ni-ya
And hit the water, then across the border
Then the cross-cross floor on the clear to Georgia
Had a hundred broads, three flipped the order
You hoes scrap, I work the boiler
You might also like
Shoutout to my Moolin Half niggas (Gangsta)
Pressure Park niggas
Eastside All-Stars, what's happenin'?
Quick, what up? (Gangsta Grillz)
Mack and Jay, what up?

Them pretty things got me across the border
Before they go in Bentleys on the way to Georgia
Got my Migo gang and that comes with the charger
He said it's sixty-five, that's only 'cause it's Georgia (DJ Drama)
She want to pick the bridge, they on their way to Georgia
And I'ma sell them shits in East Atlanta Georgia
That's if the plug don't get behind that truck and trade
Lord please, let me and Ye get back to Georgia

Just fucked twenty grand up, peace, I'll make another million (Go)
Get 'em back to Georgia, break 'em down and make a killing (Yeah)
Check the speed on Damana, thank god it's sixty-five
Drop a quarter in the country, I'ma charge 'em sixty-five (Go)
All the flies in my stomach, can I feel 'em finna fuck me?
'Cause I just called Georgia borders and the state patrol watching shit (They watching)
Shit, I got 'em in the trunk of a Cevi so I don't look so suspicious
Growing up in East Atlanta, I know Gucci doing dishes
Where'd he go? New'll lick him when it hit us
Say you coming back to town, about a thousand pounds a minute
I'm doing digits, two mil a year in a week, what's a million dollar trap?
And I did a lot of debit before I ever wrote a rap (Let's go)
Them pretty things got me across the border
Before they go in Bentleys on the way to Georgia
Got my Migo gang and that comes with the charger
He said it's sixty-five, that's only 'cause it's Georgia
She want to pick the bridge, they on their way to Georgia
And I'ma sell them shits in East Atlanta Georgia (It's Gucci, man)
That's if the plug don't get behind that truck and trade (East Atlanta, stand up, man, what's happenin'?)
Lord please, let me and Ye get back to Georgia

I got this Mac N Cheese for naked men, she take that dick, she baking it (Huh?)
That's how she be scraping it, her sick nigga let her take the shit (Skrrt)
I cuffed and bust her, baby, baby, damn near by my razor (Yeah)
Help me count these faces, shawty, help me, make me crazy rich
My white girl down in the middle of Georgia, bringing me caucasian bricks
And East wouldn't let him, learned his lesson, Boozoo to a mexican
Them bands again show all his friends to this young black American
He from lil shawty, bought that RZA, and he ain't even shot his son (Gangsta Grillz)

Now, me, myself
I'm originally from PA
Named my name in GA
See, I hustled this music all over Georgia
Now they want the product worldwide
It's nothing like itEmbed
