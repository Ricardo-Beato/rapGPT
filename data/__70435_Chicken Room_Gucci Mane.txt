11 ContributorsChicken Room Lyrics
Go! If it’s a coke drought, then why's your wifey coked out?
Butt-naked, snortin’ lines in the dope house
I’m too far, smoking cigars in the dining room
Got birds everywhere, that’s why it’s called the dining room
300 pounds wrapped tight, I need every room
And move the clothes, I put the money in the closet, fool
I'm not a handyman, but Gucci keeps a lot of tools
I teach niggas how to cut it, like it’s barber's school
Wait a minute, just be patient, I may take a minute
I’m in a dark and tinted Mercedes, it cost a pretty penny
I’m in the kitchen and I’m water-whippin
I hit it for the freak, ‘cause homey bought a half a chicken

Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room

I'm in my Phantom with my madam and a fat blunt
I dump the ashes in an empty cup of grape fruitpunch
I'm having fun, prima donna
Sellin’ pills and chron’
I need it by the ton
I want it wit a grape one
Me and Rock from the block, that’s a great bond
I'm in the Zone 6, I'm coolin' with my black gun
True religion, .50 is my true religion
And there ain’t no robbin’ me
.50 in my robbin’ jeans
Ain't no "I" in team
You want 1017
You know my regime
Got money, all means
I bring it to you clean, I bring it to you raw
I got a 100 things, I'm tryin’ to numb your jaw
You might also like
Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room

Hey, R-O-C the Don, I'm flyer than an owl
Who that say they got new falcons? I’m passing out right now
I quote my mouth when I talk. These niggas scary
Repeat whatever they hear, these niggas parrots
Eyes of despair, I can’t spare it
Has to get my coach
That’s why I ?rode the vultures
D.E.E
I’m a pescetarian, I don’t eat beef
Go google that word
My favorite food is birds
They tryin’ to get the formula
But I’m on to them
They know I got them 5 birds, and they wantin’ them
The Pontiacs, where the fuck I'mma put this money at?
Look, now I got 30 from ?sealings this year, 100 mill
Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken roomEmbed
