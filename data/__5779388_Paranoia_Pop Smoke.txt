Yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Paranoia, I'm havin' thoughts in my head
I'm 'bout to party in Cartier, yeah
Walk in the club with two straps
When I "Woo," "Woo" back
Don't ask who I am, shoot that in my Dior, ooh

I told her back off 'fore I'm 'bout to catch a body
Bitch, this puller ain't no fuckin' Miley Cyrus, Kawasaki (Ooh, skrrt)
She gon' ride it like a Harley, niggas hardly gettin' money right now
I told this bitch, "I can't keep up, most of my thoughts in the clouds" (Ah, ah, ah, yeah)
Paranoid, I know some niggas wanna see me gone
Just made twenty mil', I'm tryna fuckin' enjoy
'Fore you kick my door down and shoot, that's my lil' boy (Yeah)
Keep a tool, loose screws, baby (Loose screws)
When you "Woo," I'ma "Woo" back (Yeah, woo, woo)
Aim at his head (Why?), put half a mil' on a case and go to bed, slatt, slatt (Yeah), yeah, yeah

Paranoia (Slatt), I'm havin' thoughts in my head (Yeah)
I'm 'bout to party in Cartier, yeah
Walk in the club with two straps
When I "Woo," "Woo" back
Don't ask who I am, shoot that (Yeah) in my Dior

Mmm, I gotta be paranoid
Grippin' that FN, you know the streets at war
Let in no one and make sure you lock the door
They hate and love blind, then you gotta watch your dog (Watch your dog)
I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry (Sorry)
Cops pulled me over 'cause I'm in a 'Rari (A 'Rari)
Got top off, but lil' mama ridin' shotty (Shotty)
Me and Woo gon' shake the room, might catch a body (Body)
Real niggas, we love to party like every day
I bought that bitch a Masi', we to the grave
Baby Boy and Taraji, I took some molly
Float like I'm Ali, tryna stay sane (Yeah)

Paranoia, I'm havin' thoughts in my head
I'm 'bout to party in Cartier, yeah
Walk in the club with two straps
When I "Woo," "Woo" back
Don't ask who I am, shoot that in my Dior

I just did six days in London, paranoia
Shoot for the stars, aim for the moon
Thoughts in my head, know that I'm Woo
When you see me, you know that I'm Woo
When you see me, you know that I'm Woo
I said paranoia, I got some thoughts in my head
I'm 'bout to party in Cartier, yeah
Walk in the club with two straps
When I "Woo," "Woo" back
Don't ask who I am, shoot that in my Dior

That's the paranoia, oh, paranoia
I said I'm paranoid, paranoia9Embed
