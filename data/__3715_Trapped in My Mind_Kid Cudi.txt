You see I'm trapped in my mind, oh I'm, goin trippy
Oh I don't think I'll ever go
You see the walls are so high that I, couldn't climb them
So I don't know which way to roll
I feel I'm stuck in rewind, though I'm, lookin forward
Damn, I wish I knew what went wrong
Am I sick, am I ill? Man, my mental got me
Oh Lord, please help me pull through
Oh baby

Oh why, oh why, ooh
Oh why, oh
Oh why, oh why, ooh
Oh why, oh

You see the sun seems to shine, when I, am not looking
Oh, it seems to trick every time
Things do get out of hand once awhile, inside my mental
Hey, I took one hell of a ride
When I see what is so, I know, I am not lucky
Yeah I like to pat my own back
It's a gift and a curse, since my birth I'm in a prison
Though I'm happy right where I'm at
You might also like
You see I'm trapped in my mind, and I, know it's crazy
Hey it's not that bad at all
When you think of the world, I know it's crazy
Hey I'm not that bad at all
I'm trapped in mind, and I, know it's crazy
Hey it's not that bad at all
When you think of the world, I know it's crazy
Hey I'm not that bad at all
Oh baby

Oh why, oh why, ooh
Oh why, oh
Oh why, oh why, ooh
Oh why, oh

You see I'm trapped in my mind, and I, know it's crazy
Hey it's not that bad at all
When you think of the world, I know it's crazy
Hey I'm not that bad at all
I'm trapped in mind, and I, know it's crazy
Hey it's not that bad at all
When you think of the world, I know it's crazy
Hey I'm not that bad at all
Oh baby
Hey I'm trapped in my mind baby
I don't think I'll ever get out
Ohh I'm trapped in my mind baby
I don't think I'll ever get out, yeah
Oh, I'm trapped in my mind, baby
I don't think I'll ever get out
I don't think I'll ever get out33Embed
