Another day another dolla
For the top dogg with the gold flea colla
Nigga make the whole dogg world wanna holla
The way they do my life and I'm steady tryin' to do more right
So trife your life could disappear
And if you ain't careful who you fuckin' wit nigga
Now reappear come here come near so you can hear what I spit
So sick and tired of niggas standin on that "G" shit
And just because you on starz wit some khakis
And think your rap style can out rap me and now jack me
Come here nigga slap yo self
Thats probably why yo shit still sittin' on the motherfuckin shelf
And mine sold out ever since it came out
Blue carpet roll out, #1 no doubt, mo' clout, down south, mixin' it up
With dem niggas that don't never hesitate to bust
What you niggas tappin' on my front door for?
Hmm, oh you lookin' for yo ho? (you heard)
We in the hotel room doin' the zoom
And let me let you know nigga my heat goes boom

And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

I'm back on the scene, chopping green, captain on the team Call me commissioner nigga so just listen up
Look like you bored and our boy's bridges
He hangin' wit dem niggas but dem niggas straight bitches
Left a nigga hangin' at the club when it was scrap time
Then a week later gave him a shout out in a rap line
Now they in a New York rap time
Rapper turned snitch, now you livin' on a main line
Money's too tight to mention but let me mention
When dem niggas in da kitchen find out he's snitchin'
They gon' get him, and when his homies find out he's snitchin
9 times out of 10 dat nigga gon be bitchin
(you know what) you know what? Transformin' is switchin'
And oh yeah informin is snitchin
But I ain't one to tell you ain't heard from me
I'm just an MC tryin to stay sucker free

And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Look here fool, I know this game in and out
And quit tryin to tell me bout dem niggas down south
Don't try to slide with that west side love shit
That dove shit, eat a dick bitch
I can read you from the giddy
I read you, I took you to my home and I fed you
And led you upstairs to a room with 37 niggas
That was strapped up hatin', waitin' on you
Nigga, you the victim
We don't don't pick 'em, we just stick 'em and when once we get 'em, we got 'em
We try to rid the streets of creeps and freaks like you
For all y'all snitches and bitches we gonna do the world a big favor
Cuz niggas like y'all be fuckin' up the gangsta flavor
And oh yeah it ain't no west coast thang
Cuz niggas out of town got birds that sing

And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Breakdown (breakdown)
