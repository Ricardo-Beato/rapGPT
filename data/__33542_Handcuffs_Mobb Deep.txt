6 ContributorsHandcuffs Lyrics(Havoc)
Girl I know you love a thug be wildin'
Smack flames out a nigga and I got you smilin'
The way I cut a nigga every which way but loose
A blood stained Gucci suit will be the proof
Laid back cat but I love to chill
Love a freak in a thong with a freak full of yarn
Said you went to catholic school and that's cool
Let me see you throw the suit on
With no interruptions, ma turn the cell off
Start for the touchin'
And I'm sick with the candle
A fatty, ain't nothin' that a nigga can't handle
I been through it
It's a first time for everything, settin you free
And I feel you your man ain't lettin' you breathe
You a dime from your face to your navel
Your man better wake the fuck up and let you out of that stable
Used to think like that until I thought
Man, the shoe on the other foot and I got thoughts
Stay home, cook and clean like she the boss
Hell no nigga, not while I'm up in New York
She gonna do what she want, flirt when she want, fuck who she want
Then nigga It's a wrap
You like 'No she won't', but yes she will
Chick might as well have Big comin' out of jail
You might also like(Chorus) X4
I got them keys to those handcuffs (handcuffs)
Wanna be free throw your hands up (wanna be free)
(Havoc)
My niggas in NY know the game
Bitch front, she gettin' out on the shoulder lane
It's 3 in the mornin', why you think you came
Should've stayed where you was, I don't play those games
Ring on the finger, fatty off the meter
There's only one thing that this shit could lead to
The reaction, your mind'll crack
And put my mans on if it's poppin'
Bitch you laughin'?
Everything that I spit is real
And everything on your inside you scared to tell
The word creep, "no" ring a bell
Girl I know the situation all too well
I'mma keep it gangsta, rep the 'bout
Lady caught on, so I had to bounce
With bleach in the crib, all my clothes got doused
That's when a nigga knew I had to get out
Know what you're goin' through, been there before
Relationships now, it's like they got these laws
Girl all you wanna do is just be free
And that's why a nigga like me got these keys
(Chorus)X42Embed
