Umm, so I, I would be able to leave you a message just like this
Just like this, just like this
Just like, right now, like this, and
Or would I, or would I have to call you
And like literally leave a message on your voicemail box?
And also what, what is the general tone of the other people?
Who are, like, are they, are they all like leavin' you voice messages and stuff?
Is that the kind of the nature of all the skits?
Likе, everyone's just callin' you and lеaving a voice message?
I, I ask because if I, if I do what I wanna
I wanna be, I wanna be consist—, I wanna contribute to the consistency of your album
If I do involve myself in it, I wanna make sure
You know I'm a stickler about consistency
I don't wanna be the one guy who's doin' the one different
But I, I wanna understand the concept as good as I can understand it
So that I can function within the rubric of your artistic vision properly
I wanna, I wanna, if, if I'm thee
If I'm on your record, it's not for my ego
I'm on your record, it's gonna be there to serve
I'm there to serve the vision that you have
I'm there to serve the vision, so, uhh
Just let me know what the answer to those questions areYou might also likeEmbed
