Huh
You gotta cherish every day, man
The present is a gift, the future's a mystery and the past is history
I'm a blizzard, an Eskimo, a polar bear, cold

Now she say she miss me (Now she say she miss me)
But every time I'm gone then she try to diss me (Then she try to diss me)
But then I let her kiss it, then she say she miss me (Now, I got her kissin' on it)
But if you miss it then fuck me, baby, fuck me like a mistress (Fuck me like a mistress, baby)
And I'ma fuck you like the first day out the penitentiary

Guwop got that dumb check (Yeah)
Yeah, he got that dome chick (Huh?)
Every time she see me, baby suck me like we just met (Yeah)
Brown, pretty, plump breasts (Yeah)
Mouth, pussy wet-wet (Woo)
Diamonds on her chest, it's like a wet t-shirt contest (Shh)
They were sayin' ehh (Ehh), now they sayin' ooh (Ooh)
And my bitch look so good these bitches wanna fuck her, too (What?)
I drop my top on College Ave, where is my missing roof? (Where?)
Until I'm old and saggin', too, suck like you're snaggle-toothed

Now she say she miss me (Now she say she miss me)
But every time I'm gone then she try to diss me (Then she try to diss me)
But then I let her kiss it, then she say she miss me (Now, I got her kissin' on it)
But if you miss it then fuck me, baby, fuck me like a mistress (Fuck me like a mistress, baby)
And I'ma fuck you like the first day out the penitentiary (Rich)
You might also like
I fucked her good, but she can't tell nobody (Nobody)
New Lamb' robotic (Skrrt)
Pull out the Wraith when we go shoppin' (What?)
Cash out, no stoppin'
I tell her, "Miss me" (Miss me)
"When I'm gone, don't try to diss me" (Huh?)
I done fucked on all her friends, they against me (Rich)
Whip with a fryin' pan (Whip)
Gave that bitch like nine bands
Ooh, pussy so damn good, she got her bag again (Her bag again)
Ayy, fuck her in her Benz, she can't drive again (Skrrt)
Ooh, she fancy 'cause she cashin' in

Now she say she miss me (Now she say she miss me)
But every time I'm gone then she try to diss me (Then she try to diss me)
But then I let her kiss it, then she say she miss me (Now, I got her kissin' on it)
But if you miss it then fuck me, baby, fuck me like a mistress (Fuck me like a mistress, baby)
And I'ma fuck you like the first day out the penitentiary

And I'ma fuck you like the first day out the penitentiary
And I'ma fuck you like the first day out the penitentiaryEmbed
