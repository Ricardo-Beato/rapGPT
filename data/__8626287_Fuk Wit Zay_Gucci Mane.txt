5 ContributorsFuk Wit Zay Lyrics
(Zaytoven)
Yeah, I fuck with Zay
You fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
Yeah, I fuck with Gwop

You fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
If you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
There ain't nothing else to say
I say you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
If you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
There ain't nothing else to say
I say you fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
You fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
There ain't nothing else to prove
Yeah, you fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
You fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
There really ain't nothing to prove, yeah

Yеah, I'm talkin' big, what up to my niece
What up to my ho, get it out thе door
Did it with the flow, I just left the stove
I just left the stove, I just left the stove
'Bout to raise the bar, hope you got a fur
Blue Goyard roller bag lookin' like a Smurf
I am on my wave again, I'll sell you a boat
And I'm so clean, bitch, I'll sell you the soap
Slide into homes, yeah, my money safe
Known to buy a Wraith if I have a bad day
Yeah, I fuck with Zay, yeah, I fuck with Wop
Wifey tip-toein' on marble floors in Gucci socks
What up, what you thought? What up, what you say?
Bought them five ladies, stole a joint out the tray
Moving through the Tray, no S-R-T-A
Ziggy on the beat, ain't nobody safe
You might also like
I say you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
If you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
There ain't nothing else to say
I say you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
If you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
There ain't nothing else to say
I say you fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
You fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
There ain't nothing else to prove
Yeah, you fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
You fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
There really ain't nothing to prove, yeah

I fuck with Zay, I fuck with Deuce
On Bouldercrest, just me and Juice
Zay was selling beats to me
I was selling three for two
Trap house ain't got nothing to do
You play with me I cock and shoot
I get lots and lots of loot
My mind is polluted too
My shooters got shooters too
Play with Zay, send shooters through
Gucci Mane, I'm on the loose
I just bought another Coup
On stage in designer suits
Nothing to lose and stupid jewels
I got plenty ye to move
Ice on me, come take a cruise
You fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
If you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
There ain't nothing else to say
I say you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
If you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
There ain't nothing else to say
I say you fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
You fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
There ain't nothing else to prove
Yeah, you fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
You fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
There really ain't nothing to prove, yeah

If you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
Ain't nothing else to say
If you fuck with Deuce, I fuck with Deuce
Ain't nothing else to say
You fuck with Gwop, I fuck with Gwop
Ain't nothing else to say
If you fuck with Zay, I fuck with Zay
Ain't nothing else to say, hahEmbed
