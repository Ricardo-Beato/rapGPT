Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back

Uh, I used to rock a double XL
Now the ladies all say I dress well
With a nice pair of jeans, LRG or Evisu
Crew neck sweatshirt, hat and some clean shoes
Pockets stayed equipped with some paper and some gold piff
Pack of gum, squares, Blackberry and a phone clip (Goddamn)
Got Most dope clique, bunch of mothafuckers lookin' fresh
Crooks and castle dress, sloppy sloppy haters shouldn't mess
Walkin' by your lady and I'm sorry if I took her breath
You was just baby, cryin' 'til you end up shook to death (Bitch)
Fade away like an Etch A Sketch
Don't second guess, ain't nobody better dressed (Uh-uh)
Text hoes wearin' less clothes than her mama like
Church girl, always go to school, she the honest type (Haha)
But when it comes to boys, she like 'em bad
So holla at the kid, I got swag
You might also like
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back

Knick-knack, paddy-whack, give that boy some clothes
Imitate the kid, you may get yourself some hoes (Haha)
Snap back, flat cap, abstract swagger (Uh-huh)
Kid come correct, never messin' up the pattern
Y'all jigsaw puzzle, mismatch mess (Mess)
Got my J's on with some jeans, lookin' fresh
Yes, my colors match
And ain't no other cats lookin' like the kid
Yeah, none of y'all fuck with Mac (Ha)
You rockin' somethin' that lookin' like a lumberjack
How you wearin' three different t-shirts under that?
Teach you how to dress real stylish, I'm the wildest
Nothin' on me lookin' childish (Haha)
Fire talk, I am hot
And y'all is just some mild sauce
Got my clothes tailored, fit so nicely
Soon you'll see these mothafuckers dressin' just like me
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back1Embed
