B-b-baby girl I think that you a vampire (vampire)
I can’t even look you in the eye (eye)
You rarely see miss lady in the day time (day time)
Baby she’s a creature of the night (yeah)
I met my girlfriend in the graveyard (graveyard shift)
She could never work a 9 to 5 (huh?)
She closed the curtains and she turned the blinds down (down, down)
'Cause baby girl a creature of the night

Zone 6 stunner, long dope runner
Big Guwop, Brick Squad, stand tall
My diamonds got insomnia, my bitch is nocturnal
She a sophomore, just start suckin' dick, but she’s a fast learner
Candy paint on all my jewelry, you can call me Willy Wonka
MAC 11 in my MCM bag, clip an anaconda
Got the twenty two like Emmitt Smith
So nigga know you gonna fumble
4 cars, red million dollars, Gucci Mane summer (catch up!)

Baby girl I think that you a vampire (vampire)
I can’t even look you in the eye (eye)
You rarely see miss lady in the day time (day time)
Baby she’s a creature of the night (yeah)
I met my girlfriend in the graveyard (graveyard shift)
She could never work a 9 to 5 (huh?)
She closed the curtains and she turned the blinds down (down, down)
'Cause baby girl a creature of the night
You might also like
Gucci got straps like Al-Qaeda
Got a vampire bitch, she a rider
Black nails, black lips, black eyeliner
Black hair to her butt, Elvira
Bling man, white teeth, white powder
Black car, gold teeth, switched style up
White 'wop bands, brick squad wilder
Get 5 heartbeats high, Eddy King Junior
Gucci

Baby girl I think that you a vampire (vampire)
I can’t even look you in the eye (eye)
You rarely see miss lady in the day time (day time)
Baby she’s a creature of the night (yeah)
I met my girlfriend in the graveyard (graveyard shift)
She could never work a 9 to 5 (huh?)
She closed the curtains and she turned the blinds down (down, down)
'Cause baby girl a creature of the night
Baby girl I think that you a vampire (vampire)
I can’t even look you in the eye (eye)
You rarely see miss lady in the day time (day time)
Baby she’s a creature of the night (yeah)
I met my girlfriend in the graveyard (graveyard shift)
She could never work a 9 to 5 (huh?)
She closed the curtains and she turned the blinds down (down, down)
