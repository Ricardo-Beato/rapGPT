4 ContributorsRemind Me of My D Lyrics
You remind me of my D, I wanna grind
Tell me hit the spot, it ain't hard to find
And if left up to me, I'll provide
I'll be on your team if you'll be on mine
And with you by my side, we'll touch the sky
'Cause you the only way we could multiply
So don't ever believe if I say goodbye
'Cause if I turn my back, I'ma change my mind
Change my mind

Them hard times, leave them days behind
I'm gettin' big cake, Bill Gates frame of mind
That's why I'm stuck with my bitch, can't change my mind
'Cause she was right there with me through my slangin' and crime
Through the pain and the lies, she made the sacrifice
She ain't the act up type when I ain't actin' right
Just around the way girl, but that's my bitch
Stay down for me, she could have my kids
Half of my bread, have the keys to my crib
I'ma treat you like the woman you is, that's on my mama
Just around the way girl, but how I in love wit'cha?
Guess it's the hoodster and the overall thug in ya
Probably the way you talk back when I'm fuckin' ya
Tell me you believe in my dream while I'm up in ya
And after climax, smoke a dime sack
Then sip Andre Mimosa and get closer
You might also like
You remind me of my D, I wanna grind
Tell me hit the spot, it ain't hard to find
And if left up to me, I'll provide
I'll be on your team if you'll be on mine
And with you by my side, we'll touch the sky
'Cause you the only way we could multiply
So don't ever believe if I say goodbye
'Cause if I turn my back, I'ma change my mind
Change my mind

Just livin' life one day at a time
The hustle had you wrapped up before I said one rhyme
The hustle had my state of mind on a constant grind
With no room in my thought process for lies
With no, room in them jeans, I'm thought, "Damn, them thighs"
Just sprinkle a little brown sugar in your devilish smile
I could see you was a rebellious child
So we relate on more levels than the evident, it's deeper than time
Would you let your defense down? She told me, "Seek and I'll find"
Let's get away for the weekend, hit the freeway and fly
Now, I let you cry, dig deep in my mind
My mama seen the route chosen and she said goodbye
I was a boy in man clothing, how could I survive?
I met you, baked a cake, then divided the pie
You're special, even with all the ornaments off you
Going back and forth to court to support you often
That's why, when you was pregnant and you made that choice
I wiped your eye, don't cry, you shouldn't rush the course
Take your time, in life, you'll be up, fa sho
The sunshine comes after the storm (And that's fa sho)
And it's somethin' 'bout you, baby, that, I just can't resist
In deep thought while I'm giving you dick
And then you, in my crib, my emotions provoke
Basically, baby girl, you're dope
You remind me of my D, I wanna grind
Tell me hit the spot, it ain't hard to find
And if left up to me, I'll provide
I'll be on your team if you'll be on mine
And with you by my side, we'll touch the sky
'Cause you the only way we could multiply
So don't ever believe if I say goodbye
'Cause if I turn my back, I'ma change my mind
Change my mindEmbed
