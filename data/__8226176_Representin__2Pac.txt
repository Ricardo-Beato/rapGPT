4 ContributorsRepresentin’ Lyrics
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
Money, Money, Money by the ton
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
Money, Money, Money by the ton
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it

Roll up and get swoll' up, hold up
How ya gonna play me like a sunkin' dunkin' donut?
I done came a long way to get checks
So give me respect when I get wreck
Or get your motherfuckin' chin checked
Once again, it's your friend outta Oakland
Hoping I can rock the shit to get ya open
Say you're looking for some real shit then catch
A funkified batch, likе that!!
Oakland's on the map
2Pac is on the big screen strivin'
Gotta love a nigga for survivin'
I wеar a lot of old school jewels
Look how the fools drool, ooohh
Stop lookin at me hard 'cause you're buffer
My nine is buckin' bigger motherfuckers
Turnin' men to suckers
Niggas wanna spark a little ruckus
Better duck 'cause I'll be poppin' them motherfuckers
They wanna throw their hands up, that's tight
Hit em wit' my ain't never had shit left, right
Then hit em wit' the uppercut, duck quick
Shit outta luck, fuckin' stuck with that rough shit
Fuck a pop song, fuck a video, fuck Arsenio
Fuck the radio Do you hear me though?
Give a holla to my niggas in the pen
And my murderous partners wit their Mac 10s
I represent the real 'cause I'm ill, G
Glock cocked 'till the day they kill me
I'm representin'
