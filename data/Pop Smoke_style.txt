The crown is only for the king, they tryna place it on a clown
I declare war, nickname, 'He Sell Raw'
Different city, same ghetto, bring the Woos on tour
Push start, drop top, 812, two-door
Baby Rover, Benz, coupe, bitch, you gotta choose yours
How can I not? Woo, how can I not?
When a brick is thirty-six, bitch, how could I stop?

Faith
To believe in something as though it already existed
Bashar means "bringer of good news" (This is a Melo beat)
When you saw the word "Faith" on this cover, I'm sure you thought this was a gospel album
The word gospel means "the good news"
So in a sense, Bashar is bringing the good news, telling you to believe in yourself
He believed in himself with an understanding that greatness was his to manifest
He had a vision, a plan, and he made it work
Good news, faith, hope, and understanding
