11 ContributorsGeekin Lyrics
Hear me now, hear me now massive crew
Call MCV to put the flame in your speakers
Yeah, man
Geekin' for the week, you can call me Screech (Call me Screech)
I can't hear my phone when I'm gone, ho, quit callin' me (Callin' me)
I don't ever trip, guess that make these niggas fall for me
Bitch, I mind my business, I ain't in it, ho, don't come for me (Yeah, yeah)

I'm going hard all week, yeah, fucked up I can't see, damn
Don't be scared for me, no, this shit what I need, ayy
Big ole, big ole, big ole butt (Big, big butt)
This is sexy, sloppy drunk (Sloppy drunk)
Downed a bottle in the club (Ayy, ayy), now I'm in here goin' nuts
I don't get hungover (Over), drink Henn' like it's soda
And my man move that, work that, knock the head right off your shoulder
Shake that ass on your friend and let her friend join in (Come here)
And if they really 'bout it, bring 'em both home to your man (Ah)
Don't fuck with me if you're scary (Yeah), 'cause this shit get hectic
Tryna get my booty rubbed after the club, who gon' text me?

Geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin', geekin', geekin' for the week
Geekin' for the week, geekin' geekin'
You might also like
My best friend a stripper, big ole booty, walk, it jiggle
And when we ride together, ho, you better grab your nigga (Get him)
Her boyfriend a dealer (Yeah), he always on duty (Always on duty)
We geekin' in the traphouse, pourin' 40's on her booty
Henny on them titties, and Patron on that pussy (Yeah)
You can stay your ass at home if you gon' party like a rookie

Bitch, I'm geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin', geekin', geekin' for the week
Geekin' for the week, geekin' geekin'

Buck on that dick like a bull (Like a bull)
I'm goin' to work on your tool (Baow, baow)
I hang round your neck like a bib (Like a bib)
I'm catchin' all of your drool (Ah)
My sex appeal on a mil (On a mil)
He call me "Megan the meal" (Megan the meal)
He tellin' you what he won't (What?)
But he get with me and he will
Windin', grindin', all on your lap
When I look back, know I control that
Goin' left to right, while he holdin' on that
If I move it slow, I bet he won't last
Geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin', geekin', geekin' for the week
Geekin' for the week, geekin' geekin'

Overdo it, watch a real bitch come kill shit
Rock lil' ass shirts 'cause my tits big (Yeah)
Turn a grown ass man to a big kid
Pop that, pop that (Yeah)
Give him eye contact when I look back
Make his ass lock up like a contract
Talk to him like Mike, nigga, who bad? (Who?)
Work some (Work some), twerk some (Twerk some)
See you lookin' at me, nigga, like you want some (Like you want some)
Got the big boy bottle, let me pour some (Let me pour some)
Bad bitches, line up if you want some

Geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin', geekin', geekin' for the week
Geekin' for the week, geekin' geekin'

Me and my bitch ain't sweatin' no list
Come through the back because they insist
That I, the hottest out now
Come to the stash, turn it to my boudoir
Niggas "Ooh-ah" when they see me
Young Tina Snow, H-Town hottie (H-Town Hottie)
Long ass legs like I'm Naomi
He reachin' for my pussy, tryna Donald Trump me
I hang on your chin like a damn goatee (Like a damn goatee)
I make him go to sleep like I'm Lei Ali (Like I'm Lei Ali)
Your whole damn clique couldn't make one of me (No)
And none of y'all hoes can't hang where I be, bitch
Geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin' for the week (Geekin')
Geekin', geekin', geekin' for the week
Geekin' for the week, geekin' geekin'

Geekin' for the week, you can call me Screech (Call me Screech)
I can't hear my phone when I'm gone, ho, quit callin' me (Callin' me)
I don't ever trip, guess that make these niggas fall for me
Bitch, I mind my business, I ain't in it, ho, don't come for me
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)1Embed
