You got a Rolex but can't tell the time 'cause you stupid as fuck (Let that boy breathe)

Uh, hit up my homie T-Money, he supply the weed for the blunt
Yeah, hit up my homie T-Money, he supply the weed for the month (Ayy)
I do it all, do what I want and I go where I want, but can't go to the mall (But can't go to the mall)
'Cause if I did, they'd shut that bitch down like

Logic hit my line, he said
"Netsil, rehtorb ym, hguoht tenretni eht kaerb em pleh"
I said "Say no more" (Say no more)
So gather 'round, but let me just say this before
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment y'all been waiting for (Waiting for)
Gerald and Bobby, the clash of the titans, go tell somebody (Go tell somebody)
The world has been waiting, the world has been watching, you finally got it (Finally got it)
They always compare us, they pit us against us, yeah, but that's not it (Yeah, but that's not it)
So get the fuck off me, my brother, he said he don't fuck with nobody
I'm feelin' godly, wearin' all white
Rewritin' history, did it tonight
My OG told me we did it right
E-40 told me we did it right
Middle school dreams, stay coming true, we doing well (We doing well)
Yeah, walk in bodegas, buying my cover of double XL (Double XL)
Yeah, fell in love with music, but I know this shit's a business now
Back to basics, like it's Lasik's, got the vision now
Been had drive, but I swear this shit's just different now (Different now)
Two Ferraris later, everything is clicking now (Let that boy breathe)
Make it pop (Ayy)

Make it drop (Ayy)
Don't stop (Ayy)
