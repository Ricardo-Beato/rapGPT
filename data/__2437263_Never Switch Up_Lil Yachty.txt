Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh, oh

Never switch up
Never switch up on my gang, no
Never switch up
Never switch up with the fame, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up, no
Never switch up
Never switch up, switching lanes, woah
Never switch up
Won't let it get to my brain, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up, no

I stayed the same
I stayed the same when I got to the fame
Didn't change a thing
Only thing changed was a young nigga name
They call me Lil Boat
Hollywood chilling, but I don't do coke
I stayed afloat
Didn't give a fuck what a young nigga thought, no
You might also like
I never cared what a nigga thought 'bout me
No, I never cared
And I think that's why they fuck with me
'Cause I stayed down and I kept my originality, woah

Never switch up
Never switch up on my gang, no
Never switch up
Never switch up with the fame, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up, no
Never switch up
Never switch up, switching lanes, woah
Never switch up
Won't let it get to my brain, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up, no3Embed
