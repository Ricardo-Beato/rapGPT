60 ContributorsInk Blot Lyrics
We are, we are, we are, we are
I’m just tryna live my life
I’m just tryna do what’s right
I’m just tryna gain insight
I’m not tryna sleep all through the day and get up at night
I’m tryna do it right
Can somebody show me the light?
I’m just tryna live my life
I’m just tryna do what’s right
I’m just tryna gain insight
I’m not tryna sleep all through the day and get up at night
I’m just tryna do it right
Can somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Can somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Can somebody
Let’s do this shit, that was lit
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
Yeah

Everybody know the real me
Something in your mind to feel free
So hot they all wanna kill me
Been forever but I’m still me
I’ma be real, I’m the man
I’ma be real I’m the rapper
I’ma be real I’m that mothafucka makin' millions
Now I ain’t no trapper
All of this shit is a facade
All of this shit is a fallacy
I ain’t me, I’m who you want me to be
Uh, fuck that
Grip the 45 and buck back
I been chillin' on the tuck back, I been chillin' on the tuck
Uh, yeah
Yup, I been way back in the cut
Homie, I don’t give a fuck
I’ma keep rapping about all of this shit that don’t matter and makin' a buck
I’ma keep, I’ma keep, uh
I’ma keep rapping about all of this shit that don’t matter and makin' a buck, listen up
I’ma keep rapping about all of this shit that don’t matter and makin' a buck

Let’s get this mothafuckin' money, man

Stupid, fake ass niggas out here man

Getting extorted and shit
You know what I’m sayin'?
Fuck y’all niggas, man
Perpetratin' ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man
All on the 'Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
And tell yo' bitch I said slob on my knob

Yo, I’ma keep all this shit for the album
Oh they gon' love that, they gon' be like, "Aw fuck"29Embed
