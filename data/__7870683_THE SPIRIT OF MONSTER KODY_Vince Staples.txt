First, what they want to know
Did you really write this book?
How can the uneducated, motherfucker drop out the sixth grade?
Go to prison, we have set you up for failure, period
You do not breathe, period
You gon' go to prison, juvenile hall, camp
Youth authority, prison
You gon' join a prison gang
You gonna either get stabbed or you're  gonna stab people
You're gonna spend the rest of your fuckin' life in solitary confinement
You are finished, Kody Scott
And I said, "Nah, fuck no
Hell nah, I ain't finished, yo"
I got a spirit of a thug in me
And not just no regular ordinary thug
I wanna know like Stan Q
Motherfuckers rebellin' against the system, and that's thug shitYou might also like1Embed
