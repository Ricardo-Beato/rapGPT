25 ContributorsConcrete Boys Lyrics
30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga

Back against the wall, concrete boys up, uh
I enter the void, I be goin' up
I shamed myself tryna fuck that bitch
Real estate, both houses on my wrist, yeah
Criss-cross my realm, Chrome Heart on my Timbs
Ten carat my earrings, them uncut gems
Jim Carrey that mask, it go up then
If'n it go up, then it's stuck then (Slatt)

Oh, let me be
Trust me with the scope, it help me see (Help you see)
If she ain't fuck bro then she fuck me (That's a fact)
If she ain't fuck me then she fuck bros (On my mom)
I just woke up, dreamin' 'bout the rose (Oh my God)
They had niggas 'round me who don't stand on toes (Hell nah)
Barely ever do I think about my foes
How much longer will I live? Only God knows

Back against the wall, concrete boys up (Yeah)
I enter the void, I be goin' up (Woo)
I shamed myself tryna fuck that bitch
Real estate, both houses on my wrist, yeah
Criss-cross my realm, come right out my DMs
Ten carat my earrings, them uncut gems (Whew)
Jim Carrey that mask, it go up then (Ayy)
If'n it go up, then it's stuck then (Uh)

Real, real, real, real
I just fucked up on a bitch from Puerto Rico (Mwah)
Put that bitch on ice, yeah, play that Mac DeMarco
Had that babysitter, she was off a narco
And I'm by my dolo like Donnie Darko (Mwah)
Splurgin' on that kitty cat, I'm such a sicko (Yeah)
Double-C, my bookbag hold a little pistol
Get them birdies out that nest 'fore I call up Mitchell

Back against the wall, concrete boys up (Yeah)
I enter the void, I be goin' up (Woo)
I shamed myself tryna fuck that bitch
Real estate, both houses on my wrist, yeah
Criss-cross my realm, come right out my DMs
Ten carat my earrings, them uncut gems (Whew)
Jim Carrey that mask, it go up then (Ayy)
If'n it go up, then it's stuck then (Up)

These bitches for everyone
Can't give the game to everyone, no
I can't lose myself tryna save them
I done took so many L's, I ain't goin' back2Embed
