All the time, all the time, all time
All the time, all the time, all time
Aight, you ready?

What do you believe in? (What's that?) Die to have respect
I believe that the world got black neglect
Living broke, liquor stores where we cashing checks
Flipping dope, pimping hoes just to make ends meet
County blues, counting days till you get set free (Dead homies)
Broke the rules so they shoot now we R.I.P
Live and learn what you earn when you cross them streets
Caught a case 'cause he wouldn't catch a fade
Living pedal to the metal 'cause he couldn't catch a break
Couldn't see the stakes, couldn't see the trouble come his way (Know that)
I'm still waiting for the day that we black and we proud
Till then we'll be shooting niggas down to the ground
Sing it loud

All the time, all the time, all time (All the time)
All the time, all the time, all time, boy
45 sit inside when I ride
If I ride for it, then I'll die for it
All the time, all the time, all time (All the time)
All the time, all the time, all time, boy
45 sit inside when I ride
If I ride for it (Kill cuz), then I'll die for it

Fuck the world shit lately, black 380
Ready for wherever God gon' take me
On my momma, I been out here since a young nigga
World tours and prison letters in my bunk, shit, this life ain't yours
See, we fighting a chore; rather kill a nigga quick
Fuck the other side, show them niggas that you with the shit
Fucking homicide, let 'em see my ass upstate
Know they love to see me rattled, sitting in that cage
'Cause when some drugs get in the battle bet you lose all faith (Faded, nigga)
I was born with a heart that the streets can't break
Never poured one shot, never rolled one J
'Cause I don't need that, shawty, point me to that bank (Nah, nah, nah)
I ain't never had no money, nigga
Young and bummy, so I had to be the funny nigga
Got a gun and started wilding like a dummy, nigga
I don't care about no murder, just another nigga (Fuck that nigga)
Pull the fucking trigger

All the time, all the time, all time (All the time)
All the time, all the time, all time, boy (Kill that nigga)
45 sitting side when I ride
If I ride for it, then I'll die for it
All the time, all the time, all time (All the time)
All the time, all the time, all time, boy (Kill that nigga)
45 sitting side when I ride
If I ride for it, then I'll die for it7Embed
