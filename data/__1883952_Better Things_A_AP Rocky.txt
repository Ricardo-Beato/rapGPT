2 ContributorsKnocked Off! Lyrics
(Uh)
Watch out, watch out 'fore you get popped off, yeah
They know we be drippin' like some hot sauce (Uh)
And lil' bitch, I'm tryna fuck, tryna get my rocks off
We know you pussy, boy, do not start (Yeah, yeah)

My niggas is ridin' with choppers, let's get it, you knocked off, uh
All of that cap for the 'Gram even though we know you not hard, uh (Yeah)
These niggas sweet like some candy, or maybe some Pop-Tarts, uh
Me and Lil Playah be livin' like we were some rockstars, uh (Uh)
AP bustdown, oh
For you I don't give a fuck now, oh
You done really lost my trust now, huh
Got so high, can't get the fuck down, oh (Yeah)

VVS diamonds, I need me a floatie
 her ride on my dick and that pussy so wet, got me feel like I'm boating
I popped a percocet today and I swear they be havin' me feel like I'm floating, uh
But I know it's bad for me, uh, I know it's sad to see, uh
These niggas mad at me, uh, I'm livin' lavishly, uh
I get a bag to speak, but I don't call it that casually
There is no nigga as rad as me, uh, stop it, you can't
Laugh at these niggas while I walk to the bank
Ahead of these niggas, on top of the rank
You might also like
My niggas is ridin' with choppers, let's get it, you knocked off, uh
All of that cap for the 'Gram even though we know you not hard, uh (Yeah)
These niggas sweet like some candy, or maybe some Pop-Tarts, uh
Me and Lil Playah be livin' like we were some rockstars, uh (Uh)
AP bustdown, oh
For you I don't give a fuck now, oh
You done really lost my trust now, huh
Got so high, can't get the fuck down, oh (Yeah)

(Yeah) Way back then, I used to be lonely
I picked up a mic, I got off my ass and now I got bitches all on me (Yeah)
They see that I'm up and not goin' down, yeah, they wanna be homies (Damn)
Isn't that sad to see? (Yeah)
I got them mad at me (Yeah)
Isn't it hard to believe? I'm on to better things (Yeah)
I lost 'em in the sauce, yeah, I know they envy me
Pockets on Rick Ross, I can't fit it in my jeans
Had to be my own boss, but you don't know what I mean

My niggas is ridin' with choppers, let's get it, you knocked off, uh
All of that cap for the 'Gram even though we know you not hard, uh (Yeah)
These niggas sweet like some candy, or maybe some Pop-Tarts, uh
Me and Lil Playah be livin' like we were some rockstars, uh (Uh)
AP bustdown, oh
For you I don't give a fuck now, oh
You done really lost my trust now, huh
Got so high, can't get the fuck down, ohEmbed
