Woah, woah
I don't know what planet I'm on (Ayy)
All we do is roll up that strong, boy I swear
Boy, I swear, I take a couple hits then I'm gone (Ayy)

Boy I swear, boy I swear
I'm the man, I'm the man
Boy I swear, boy I swear
I'm the man, I'm the man
Boy I swear, boy I swear
I'm the man, I'm the man

Boy I swear (Boy), I'm better than ever and I'ma be better forever
Boy I swear (Boy), she fuckin' whoever whenever, I fuck her whenever
Boy I swear (I swear), just keep it together, the money I get it forever
Boy I swear (I swear), forever, forever, fucking forever, forever
Boy I swear, I'm laced up, caked up with this ecstasy (I'm laced up)
I treat these drugs like my women, I keep 'em next to me, ayy (I need 'em)
I got more green than that spinach, I need my veggies (Yah, yah)
Breathing heavy but steady, this X, it keep me from stressin'
I'm gone, ayy, ayy (Boy I swear that I'm gone)
I don't know what planet I'm on (I don't know what planet I'm on)
All we do is roll up that strong (All we do is roll up that strong, ayy, ayy)
Take a couple hits then I'm gone, and we gone (Take a couple hits then I'm gone, ayy)
