6 ContributorsDetox Lyrics
Airplane mode for the evening
Detox lemme go and breathe in
Exhale changing with the seasons
And I heard you say you didn't need friends
I see ya' apathetic and I get it
People don't just do that for no reason
But tell the truth, I think that shit pathetic
Wait until we fall right off the deep end
And I might have to turn this shit around
They don't wanna see you build, they gonna burn it to the ground
Every time that I get high, I think I’m flirting with the clouds
Only time I feel inspired when I'm swervin’ through my town
Airplane mode for the evening
Detox lemme go and breathe in
Exhale changing with the seasons
And I heard you say you didn't need friends
I see ya' apathetic and I get it
People don't just do that for no reason
But tell the truth, I think that shit pathetic
Wait until we fall right off the deep end
And I might have to turn this shit around
They don't wanna see you build, they gonna burn it to the ground
Every time that I get high, I think I’m flirting with the clouds
Only time I feel inspired when I'm swervin’ through my town
Airplane mode for the evening
Detox lemme go and breathe in
Exhale changing with the seasons
And I heard you say you didn't need friends
I see ya' apathetic and I get it
People don't just do that for no reason
But tell the truth, I think that shit pathetic
Wait until we fall right off the deep end
And I might have to turn this shit around
They don't wanna see you build, they gonna burn it to the ground
Every time that I get high, I think I’m flirting with the clouds
Only time I feel inspired when I'm swervin’ through my town
Airplane mode for the evening
Detox lemme go and breathe in
Exhale changing with the seasons
And I heard you say you didn't need friends
I see ya' apathetic and I get it
People don't just do that for no reason
But tell the truth, I think that shit pathetic
Wait until we fall right off the deep end
And I might have to turn this shit around
They don't wanna see you build, they gonna burn it to the ground
Every time that I get high, I think I’m flirting with the clouds
Only time I feel inspired when I'm swervin’ through my townYou might also like1Embed
