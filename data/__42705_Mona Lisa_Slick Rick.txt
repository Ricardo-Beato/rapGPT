31 ContributorsMona Lisa Lyrics
Ladies, and gentlemen, and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure that we are here to present tonight
Slick Rick, the Ruler! And MC Ricky D!
Doing their smash hit, "Mona Lisa," you know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out to bow before his divine majesty
Oh, your majesty?
Hmm
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hmm
*Kisses*
Enough!
Come your highness, they await you

Well, it was one of those days, not much to do
I was chillin' downtown with my old school crew
I went into a store to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Monaâ€”what?
Mona Lisa (What?), Mona Lisa, so men named you
You know what I'm sayin'? So I said
"Excuse me, dear, my gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money, I'll buy that slice!"
She said, "Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you"
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (PING!) I almost blinded her
She said, "Great Scott! Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth"
Ha-ha, hah! Had to find that funny
So I said, "No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief? Please! Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet"
She almost got cut short -- you know, scissored
She tried to disrespect WHO?! The Grand Wizard
Me! "Well what's your name, son?"
"MC Ricky D," but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
"I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uhh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past"
She said, "Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin"
A virgin?! Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin -- with her yay wide gap
I said, "It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky:
R - ravishing
I - impress
C - courageous or careless
K - for the Kangols which I've got
That I wear everyday and Y -- Why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm..
Quite polite like Walter Cronkite"
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, "Hey Rick, don't you know playing with these snakes is a sin?!?"
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, "I don't want to see you playing with these lowlifes no more!
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of our friends"
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!
And as we were leaving and driving along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song
You might also likeIf you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by, foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye
You walked on by8Embed
