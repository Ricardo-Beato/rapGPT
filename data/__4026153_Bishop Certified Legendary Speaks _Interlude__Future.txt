5 ContributorsBishop Certified Legendary Speaks (Interlude) Lyrics
Speaking for a million, this is bishop
Official Certified Legendary signee, no mercy
No mercy is death before dishonor
No mercy is taken from the oppressed
Unmercifully keeping them hungry
No mercy is the judge chambers
Trying our children as adults
No mercy is facing two life sentences, plus forty
Which is psychological breakdown to the base
And causes a slow death or suffocation, and to steal your faith
No mercy is the systematical system programmed agenda at all costs
By any means necessary to kill, steal, and destroy you
No mercy is the system allowing our babies to die
Or so-called "justified slaughters" by the agents of oppressors
No mercy was, and still is Nat Turner, Jared Jackson, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby SealeYou might also likeEmbed
