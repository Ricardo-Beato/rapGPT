28 ContributorsBaba Says Cool for Thought Lyrics
They thought it was cool to burn crosses in your front lawn as they hung you from trees in your backyard
They thought it was cool to leave you thirsty and stranded, Katrina
He thought it was cool to carry a gun in his classroom and open fire, Virginia Tech, Columbine, stop the violence
They thought it was cool to tear down the projects and put up million dollar condos, gentrification
They think it's cool to stand on the block hiding product in their socks making quick dime bag dollars
They think it's cool to ride down on you in blue and white and unmarked cars, busting you upside your head
Freeze
'Cause the problem is we think it's cool too
Check your ingredients before you overdose on The Cool6Embed
