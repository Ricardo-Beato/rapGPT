12 ContributorsFeets Lyrics
808 Mafia

A nigga just front me 10 keys
I’mma run up on a nigga on feet
Gotta get back on my feet
Choppa knock a nigga off of his feet
Jump a nigga, stomp his ass with my feet
Red bottoms on the bottom of my cleats
The only nigga in a Phantom on feets
Touch me and you’ll be 6 feet deep
Feet!

Bougie ass club, they let a crook in this bitch
Take a deuce to a fo', I put my foot in this shit!
They say that Gucci Mane be flexin' unbelievable price
And I know that life is priceless, but I pay for your life
I think I’m Dirty Harry, nigga, when I got that .45
And I can never respect a man that can’t look me in my eyes
Just as stupid as these rappers if you believe the lies
You bring a knife to a gunfight, yo' ass wanna die!
I’m not a rapper, I’m a trapper in a rapper disguise
I put the feets on ya, leave a Reebok print on ya eye
I put the feets on the plug, cause his price is too high
I’m showin' my feet, Louis flip flops, I’m way in Dubai (it’s Gucci)

A nigga just front me 10 keys
I’mma run up on a nigga on feet
Gotta get back on my feet
Choppa knock a nigga off of his feet
Jump a nigga, stomp his ass with my feet
Red bottoms on the bottom of my cleats
The only nigga in a Phantom on feets
Touch me and you’ll be 6 feet deep
Feet!

Apply pressure, got they neck, I got my foot on it
(I got my foot on it)
V12 car, got my foot on it
Gucci cleats, on my feet
(On ya feet!)
Gooc and me, we run the streets
(We run the streets!)
Walk it like I talk it, play it how I got it
Ain’t a phony bone on me homie, bitch you can X-ray my toes
Good in e'er hood, we run the town
A Thousand niggas throwin' up B’s, 10 toes down
I ain’t jump off the porch, I leaped in the streets
Real street cats always land on they feet
Born a standup guy, that’s all I ever knew
You can tell a rich nigga just look at his shoes!
Tarantino!
A nigga just front me 10 keys
I’mma run up on a nigga on feet
Gotta get back on my feet
Choppa knock a nigga off of his feet
Jump a nigga, stomp his ass with my feet
Red bottoms on the bottom of my cleats
The only nigga in a Phantom on feets
Touch me and you’ll be 6 feet deep
Feet!Embed
