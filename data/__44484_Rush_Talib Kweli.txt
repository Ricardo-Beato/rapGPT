28 ContributorsRush Lyrics
Feel the rush (Yeah), feel the rush
Feel the rush (You get Chuck D-ed), feel the rush (I do this shit for real)
Feel the rush (Shut the fuck down), feel the rush (Ain't no games bein' played)
Feel the rush (Never that, never that), feel the rush (It might be the career)
Feel the rush (Yeah), feel the rush (It might be on the stage)
Feel the rush (Yeah), feel the rush (It might be in the street)
Feel the rush (Yeah), feel the rush (But the people come to me)
Feel the rush, (Why?) feel the rush

They come to me for the lyrical, spiritual, raw shit I spit at you
Original, and I see collective, not individual
Visual, on the mic I'm un-fuck-with-able
Invincible, official nigga who they come to
For the hardcore, art of war, rhymes that I got in store
Triple-W-Nkiru-Center-dot-org
For education and culture, heads is waitin' for Mos to
Do the album with Kweli, we do it like we suppose to
Nobody come close to my crew, we wild nice
You ain't tight, your rhymes is like what a child writes
When he can't spell, you chase crumbs and get ate like Hansel
Can't hold your mic, like your liquor, your style like an Amstel
Smack a nigga 'til my motherfuckin hands swell
You ain't fly and you prolly got canceled
Y'all niggas shaky like handheld, amateur camera work
In walking this planet of earth
I'm the illest emcee and a man of my word
When I came out, niggas didn't understand it at first
I'm known to roll up my sleeves and put my hands in the dirt
We at war and I got a battle plan that can work
With the proper execution, so I'm killin' the mic
You get hit like a deer standin' still in the light
I'm spillin' it like I ain't never had a meal in my life
Feed my family with my pen, it's so real what I write
You might also like
We fight, fuck, get buck wild
Kill, chill, make love, have child
Freestyle, b-boy, hit the block
Build, destroy, get it hot, yo

I make the place go apeshit (C'mon)
Ain't no other way to say it, ain't nothin' to play with
I'm Langston Hughes' "Dreams Deferred" seen and heard in the flesh
'Cause so many people believe the word even when it seems absurd
With keen observation, I peep the game
And got blood on his hands, I can see the stains
My street slang spray like shots when heat bang out (Baow)
Niggas keep my name in they mouth, I put they flame out
Where I'm from, action is first and talk is second
I'm sharp like the blade in the logo of Rawkus Records
New York's infected, niggas beefin' on the mixtape
Got nickel bag niggas thinkin' they can fuck with big weight
Hell no, give it up, it's enough
We about to live it up, with ten of us
We ride and get in with us
Pick it up, party people, you about to get in touch
Give it up, everybody, you about to get a rush
You can find Kweli in the cut
With a Cohiba lit up, 'bout to split a Dutch
Get it up, everybody, you about to get in touch
Give it up, everybody, you about to get a rush (Woo)
Yeah
Yeah, quality material
Yo, check this out
Yeah, you heard it, Kweli
You don't know how to say it by now, fuck you
Broadcastin' live from Brooklyn, New York City
Yeah, turn this shit up
It's quality music
You know how we use it
Feel the rush

You 'bout to feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush
Feel the rush, feel the rush1Embed
