We were born in sin, We die in sin
Lord have mercy
I did a lot in this life
So I fight and survive, Lord have mercy
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Lord have mercy
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Mercy, mercy, Lord have mercy

Now, standin' at the crossroads
Starin' at the cosmos
I'm a product of this gang bang
How we end up, only God knows
I'ma do about the self hate
I'm just tryna get myself straight
I'm so caught up in this wealth race
Cause I know how takin' L's taste
Look, set flame to your soul with us
When in wrong do what's wrong with us
Pops wasn't in the home with us
So we follow suit, look up to these old niggas
I can tell you how it go nigga
Light the fire with the flame, explode nigga
Nah, you gotta be a cold nigga
With the yellow brick road, brimstone nigga
You might also like
We were born in sin, We die in sin
Lord have mercy
I did a lot in this life
So I fight and survive, Lord have mercy
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Lord have mercy
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Mercy, mercy, Lord have mercy

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
