Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
I'm playing with them
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers... squad

Shot fired, man down, 100 drone, boy, rocks a don
My young niggas, they wretched, bout to snatch a plug, kidnap it
With them choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers
Yeah we wet ya block up, block up, block up, block up, block up yeah
It's just me, Guwop, and Waka, riding around with them choppers
Broad day we sparkling, we strapped up desperado
I'm just cruising through the streets, me and Road Runner
4 choppers, too deep, me and Road Runner
Leave big holes in you like doughnuts
Leave the icing on your bitch face like doughnuts
Choppers leave you chopped like cold cuts
Young mob, bricksquad, bitch get your choppers
You might also like
I heard your man, he done passed on, he didn't last long
I'm a drop them bands on, they gone sing a sad song
Killed your granddaddy, fuck nigga, and your grandson
Filled a nigga full of holes, throw his ass a tampon
Catch the tuly with the cooly, tech with the breathing holes
Got a couple O's but half of them ain't breathing though
Got O's that'll kill your ass they don't need no reason for
I'm a buy some reefer smoke and send you to your reefer ho
Knock on your door, it's nice to meet you
Street sweeper, it's nice to bleach you
Thousand t-shirt, I bring my blamer cause i ain't got no trust for people
Hood ass Gucci got me, all I need is important people
Told a goon so I'm a leave em, set it off like Queen Latifah

Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
I'm playing with them
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers... squad
Aks and 223s carve these extended clips
Got hundred round drums, they shoot down bricks
Million dollars worth of licks, i hit his own 6
Bricksquad niggas know for taking niggas' shit
Scooter and Waka Flocka, OG and Gucci Mane
We shoot head shots, bullets bust your brain
Check your mailbox, I sent you 4 things
You don't cash out, hit you for playing games
Where the young niggas at, I'm talkin' bout shootin' choppers
A green light your nine, next notch off your pocket
When you playin' with the Rockets, gotta keep it solid
Thousands rounds at your ass, your whole hood dying

Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
I'm playing with them
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers
Play with them choppers, choppers... squad
I pay 200 dollars for my first chopper
All I want for Christmas is a motherfucking chopper
On my knees, saying my prayers with my fucking chopper
Too in love with the streets, I never had a ho problem
I leave it for them suckers
Them bitches say he's cool, but he's a dirty motherfucker
I ain't got time for it, ain't no need me lying to her
I would rather go buy half a pound, get on my click and blow it
A 100 in the chopper, 100 hell rocking
Everything over here 100, that's why they can't stop us
Real street niggas go fuck up the whole profit
20 bands worth of guns sitting in one closet1Embed
