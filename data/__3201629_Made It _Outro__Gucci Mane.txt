35 ContributorsMade It (Outro) Lyrics
Huh, Ziggy (Ziggy)
Zay, Gucci
Zaytoven

I'm the definition of a rich trap nigga
Ex-Con, drug don, certified killa
Young nigga trapping for them new Lebrons nigga
I was trafficking and passing bricks like I'm Lebron nigga
Steph Curry pound of kush under my armor nigga
Arm and hammer Gucci cook it right in front of niggas
Everybody bosses really they just runners nigga
On YSL designer down I drip like gunna nigga
Have you been so broke you had to serve a pregnant lady
Feeding crack rock to a baby and you really just a baby
The shit I seen in Sun Valley drive a nigga crazy
I drunk so many pints I damn near drove my mama crazy

This shit crazy
I'm crazy
Life crazy
They say my wife crazy
I'm marrying a killer
This ain't rock bottom
Can't go anywhere but up
It's Gucci, ha
I walk in the bank they say
"Hey, Mr. Davis, how may I assist you?" (Huh?)
It's Gucci, yeah
It's Wizop (Go)

I act like I forgot but I was once a mental patient
Sittin' still in a cell while my career deteriorated
Now everyday I wake up I feel invigorated
Got Rihanna on IG talking about Gucci's transformation
Minor setback for a major compilation
Meant to say comeback but I might drop a compilation
Sometimes I post a pic just so I can block all the haters
A lot of niggas sending threats I don't know what the wait is
They actin' like they tough but don't want no confrontation
These sucka's ain't even man enough to say congratulations
2018 20 year my high school graduation
I might go in my bag and send them on a paid vacation
You never sold a brick I understand the fascination
You think he a D boy but really he's a scammer baby
I'm from East Atlanta by way of Alabama baby
Took so many bricks to 'bama my pic should be laminated

I know my aunt looking down on me like
"I'm glad you made it"
I know my uncle looking down on me like
"I'm glad you made it"
I know Slim Dunk', Bankroll, Shawty Lo, Lonnie, East Atlanta Beasley, looking down on me like
"I'm glad you made it"Embed
