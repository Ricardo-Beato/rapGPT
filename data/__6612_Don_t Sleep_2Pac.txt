10 ContributorsDonâ€™t Sleep Lyrics
Ahhh shit hahaha
When I enter the first zone, worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up, evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy, manifestin' military styles
Casual tragedy when niggas battle me
My prophecized prediction, switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch, and watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin', still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'; Hell or prison
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world me and the mob gettin' married
It seems horrifying screams pierce the dark
Just as suspected, a trick bitch where is your heart
You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til it's no one left
Don't sleep

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
You might also like
Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random, rapidly
Wit' accuracy, they shouldn't talk, bad to me
It had to be a motherfuckin' murder, I'm glad to be
A nigga that did the murder, so sad to see
Another motherfucker floatin' In plastic reef
Sleep wit' his head wide open (head smokin')
Rapid release, keep the police coastin'
Casualties warrant in deep east Oakland (doors wide open)
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt
Drove off to the hills, positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the Lex Ruger, death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullets fly, kill and execute 'em

I blast first 'til they body me
Like my guns in variety
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front
Doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hands on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine, movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples nigga, nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin'
Dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out, ain't no easy way outs for easy exits
Don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)

G's up
A-Town
When I hit the street, all I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tear, when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un- for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose, then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
What ever you do shawty you better think wisely
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap (Aye)
I use my thoughts and pen similar to a saran wrap
A lil' lame nigga I'll never be
Yeah I'ma keep it g I'm from the Three and Scrap will never sleep
Aye
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
Don't sleep
