5 ContributorsBack Again LyricsSee everday im on the block man
9 millimeter on the waist and the walkman
Your boy can't stop talking
Tried to leave the life and came back again
Trying to make a lil change but
Trouble seems to follow me everywhere i go man
Find myself doing the same things
If i dont change i'll be right back againYou might also likeEmbed
