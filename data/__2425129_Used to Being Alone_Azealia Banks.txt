23 ContributorsUsed to Being Alone Lyrics
How does it feel?
(Stuck in my mind)
How does it feel to..
How does it feel?
(Stuck in my mind)
To treat me the way..
How does it feel
To treat me the way you?
How does it feel
To treat me the way you do?

Stuck in my mind
Stuck
Stuck in my mind

Oh, it took so long to get over ya
How do I prepare?
When I swore I'd never see you again?
And now you're here
Looking as surreal as before
(Stuck, stuck in my mind)
Now that I am so used to being alone..
Oh, it took so long to get over ya
How do I prepare?
When I swore I'd never see you again?
And now you're here
Looking as surreal as before
(Stuck, stuck in my mind)
Now that I am so used to being alone..
You might also like
How does it feel?
How does it feel to..
How does it feel
To treat me the way?
How does it feel
To treat me the way you?
How does it feel
To treat me the way you...11Embed
