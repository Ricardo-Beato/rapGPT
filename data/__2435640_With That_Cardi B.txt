9 ContributorsWith That Lyrics
Hundred band, hundred band
I'm 'bout my bread I got to get this shmoney man
They fuck with my shmoney I'm sending them shots I watch them do the running man
I'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that
I'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that
He just want to splurge and its ok I'm so cool with that
5 thousand on a purse yeah baby boy I'm so cool with that
Fuck him so good he gonna want to go spend all that
Pussy got him on the jugg he gonna re-up and come right back

No I'm not cool, 'cause bitch I'm bool
And I'm been jacking that ever since school
So don't be a fool
Run up on me got mechanics with tools
And they ain't scared to lose
They had me on snooze
Now when I host it's is a zoo
When the host is a zoo
Got me a check I got a check
Feeling so blessed
Doing a lot more than what they expect
I'm in my prime everything in effect
And I'm so cool with that
This hustle not new to that
Sell out these spots got 'em thinking like who did that
This new bitch from the Bronx
The one that you slept on for so long so cool all that, cool all that

Hundred band, hundred band
I'm 'bout my bread I got to get this shmoney man
They fuck with my shmoney I'm sending them shots I watch them do the running man
I'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that
I'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that
He just want to splurge and its ok I'm so cool with that
5 thousand on a purse yeah baby boy I'm so cool with that
Fuck him so good he gonna want to go spend all that
Pussy got him on the juug he gon' re-up and come right back

He want to dab in this pussy but I don't think he get the picture
He ask me what I want I tell him, make me look like Sub-Zero sister
I'm talking that ice, just ignore the price or I might just dismiss ya
Don't do broke niggas, ain't no joke nigga 'cause the pussy delicious
Bitches mad at me cause I'm on my shit
I know they doubted me cause I used to strip
Blew on IG on some regular shit, then she to TV on some degular shit
When I pull up on that bitch for talking that shit amnesia kick in and I swear they forget
Then I think to myself they ain't fuck with my money then I keep it pushing watch out lil' bitch

Hundred band, hundred band
I'm 'bout my bread I got to get this shmoney man
They fuck with my shmoney I'm sending them shots I watch them do the running man
I'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that
I'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that
He just want to splurge and its ok I'm so cool with that
5 thousand on a purse yeah baby boy I'm so cool with that
Fuck him so good he gonna want to go spend all that
Pussy got him on the jugg he gon' re-up and come right backEmbed
