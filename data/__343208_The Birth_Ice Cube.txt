12 ContributorsThe Birth Lyrics
Dr. Bruce, telephone, please, Dr. Bruce, telephone, please

Come on, come on, honey, push a little harder, it's not all that bad

I see the head
Push, push

Come on

Come on, push

Come on, honey

Push

It's a boy

The black man and black woman have no further
No beginning and no ending
Before alpha and after omega
History and historians'll record
The black father and mother of morality, medicine, music and mathematics
The father and mother of all the nation of religion, philosophy, art, science and civilization
No further
All they can say about the black man
Is he was, he is, and he shall be
Before him there were none
And after him, there will be no more
Before we can make a way for the peace maker
We must kill, and get rid of the peace breakerYou might also like1Embed
