9 ContributorsCrazy Lyrics
I think I'm goin' crazy

I think I'm goin' crazy, losin' my mind
I see elephants all of the time, I'm goin' loco
I think I'm losin' my mind, goin' crazy (I'm goin' loco)
Feel like I'm flyin' on a spaceship (Smoke Acapulco)
Speech gone, elephants kinda got my tongue (I'm goin' loco)
We ain't goin' home 'til the motherfuckin' sun

Up all night on this road
Feels like my head is gonna explode
Vision all fucked up, man, I'm gone
Dead in the middle of the twilight zone
Losin' my mind, so high, no lie
Can't tell if I'm in a dream, my, oh my
If I die tonight, I'ma get high tonight
Not sure I'll survive the night
Now I sweat, can't see straight
Now I start to hallucinate
Still way so crazed, you know it now
If you come at me, better slow it down
I'm about to snap, don't come close
Got a strap on the lap, ratta-tat-tat
Po-Po's comin', I'm on the run
With sun on my back and my elephant lungs
If I see another one, grab my elephant gun
If you can't see, it's irrelevant, son
"He's so insane," that's what they say
"He hit that bong too hard one day"
You might also like
I think I'm losin' my mind, goin' crazy (I'm goin' loco)
Feel like I'm flyin' on a space ship
Speech gone, elephants kinda got my tongue
We ain't goin' home 'til the mother fuckin' sun
I think I'm losin' my mind, goin' crazy
Feel like I'm flyin' on a space ship
Speech is gone, elephant's kinda got my tongue
We ain't goin' home 'til the motherfuckin' sun

Burn my clutch, brain got stuck
Somethin' ain't right, I can feel it in my gut
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know
Where I came from or where's my home
If I seem uptight, you ain't wrong
I'm 'bout to start swingin' and droppin' bombs
Got that stare, you know which one
One that says, "I kill you for fun"
Nigga went nuts, what the f-
I really can't tell which way is up
'Bout to snap, don't come close
Strap on the lap, ratta-tat-tat

Think I'm goin' crazy, goin' crazy
Think I'm goin' crazy, goin' crazy (I'm goin' loco)
I think I'm losin' my mind, goin' crazy (I'm goin' loco)
Feel like I'm flyin' on a space ship
Speech gone, elephant's kinda got my tongue
We ain't goin' home 'til the motherfuckin' sun
I'm goin' loco
(I think I'm losing my mind, goin crazy)
(I feel like I'm flyin' on a space ship)
(Speech gone, elephant's kinda got my tongue)
(We ain't goin' home 'til the fuckin' break of dawn)Embed
