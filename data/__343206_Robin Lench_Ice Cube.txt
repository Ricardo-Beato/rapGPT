17 ContributorsRobin Lench Lyrics
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Robin Lench
And welcome to the "Lifestyles of the Poor and Unfortunate" (Man, fuck you)
Where you and your broad can win eight days and nine dangerous nights
At The Come On In Motel overviewing the Watts Tower
And for your transportation pleasures, you get to ride on what?
The "R.T.D.", the "Rough, Tough and Dangerous"
Where we provide you and your bitch round trip transfer
Straight down range (Ayo, nigga, get outta the car, nigga)
Where you get to meet, who? O.G. MudBone (Man, who the fuck you talkin' 'bout?)
Hello, O.G. MudBone, say hi (Nigga, fuck you, motherfucker, get outta here)
(Win these nuts, punk)
And for your gambling cravings
You can lose that trick-bitch that's with ya, almost, well
Basically anywhere (I'll give you twenty dollars for your bitch)
And for your nightlife entertainment, you get to visit
Our very own strawberry showgirls
Located where? On Figueroa (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, bitch, ayy, how much for head?
Until next time
Forty ounce dreams and watermelon wishes
I'm Robin Lench, peace
