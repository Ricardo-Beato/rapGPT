This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know
That this could be forever, baby
Open up your eyes and tell me what you thinking
Open up your mind, and tell me what you seeing inside of me
Why we fussing, fucking up this evening?
I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason
Up on the sea, where I see you fallin' in the deep end
Is it love? I would really love to know the meaning
What's the grudge that you're holdin'? Hold my hand
Let me take you to the land where the ocean and the sands are meetin'
Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom
Open up your heart
If we don't love, then we fall apart

This could be forever, baby
I never seen you wetter, baby
Than when the tears fall, soakin' up your sweater, baby
I didn't mean harmâ€”don't make me regret it, baby
'Cause if I never knew you, I could never do this to you
Hope you understand
They never taught me how to be a man, only how to be a shooter
I only need the time to prove it
'Cause this could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know
That this could be forever, baby

My teachers told me we was slaves
My mama told me we was kings
I don't know who to listen to
I guess we somewhere in between
My feelings told me love is real
But feelings known to get you killed
I feel as if I'm misconstrued
I spend my moments missing you
I'm searching for atonement
Do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid and people left alone
Pick up the phone
Don't leave me alone in this cruel, cruel worldYou might also like77Embed
