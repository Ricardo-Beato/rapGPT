40 ContributorsWon’t Stop Lyrics
We are so far away from here

Tell 'em run it back, this song is my shit
Told that DJ "Turn it up!", all we did was Bowflex (Woo)
It’s that Stone Mountain, DeKalb county
Fuck boys know shit 'bout me
Still real, no shit, cash gun, money clip
285 to 400 then I made a left (Yeah)
Man, we spend it up in Lenox, boy, we fresh to death
They be sleepin' when I left, now they heard of me
We get paid to get y’all hyped, that’s that turnip green
New kicks, street ball (Ayy)
Black top, asphalt
Tight dress, her ass fault, get face like bath salts
Airport atheist, only pray when there's turbulence
So why the fuck am I stressin’ over this nervous shit?

We are so far away from here
We are so far away from here

Burn, burn, burn
My new car (Yeah), my new clothes (Hoo)
Now that I’m on top, are you proud of me?
Burn, burn, burn (Yeah)
My new car (Yeah), my new clothes (Hoo)
Now that I won't stop, are you proud of me?

All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are ya proud of me, proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are ya proud of me, proud of me?
Are you proud of me?
Are you proud of me?

Na-na-no, shoulda known
