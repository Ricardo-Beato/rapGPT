3 ContributorsFly Away Lyrics
I got a hunna birds, and they all dirty
I tell em fly away, I tell em fly away
I got a hunna birds, and they go for 30
I tell em come and pay, I tell em come and pay
I got a hunna birds, and they all dirty
I tell em fly away, I tell em fly away
I got a hunna birds, and they go for 30
I tell em come and pay, I tell em come and pay

I'm on that money mission, don’t got to ask permission
I'm smokin', no permission, no pun intended
Some people gon’ be offended, I started independent
But now I'm handlin' business, two thousand dollar britches
I smear my Gods my witness, I put myself in position
But thanks for heavy whippin', it kept a new perscription
See I'm a 80's baby, know what the 80's made me
They made me proud and crazy, but I'm so far from lazy
I got them dirty birds, you know them eagles homie
I got them dirty birds, they got them dragons on em
I know your homie want em, tell him I got em for em
When ever that he need em, tell him I’ll pull up on em (It’s Gucci)

I got a hunna birds, and they all dirty
I tell em fly away, I tell em fly away
I got a hunna birds, and they go for 30
I tell em come and pay, I tell em come and pay
I got a hunna birds, and they all dirty
I tell em fly away, I tell em fly away
I got a hunna birds, and they go for 30
I tell em come and pay, I tell em come and pay

I got a hundred birds, I tell them fly away
Thanksgiving turkeys, 30's go right away
I keep them pigeons on your block, dirty every day
I got permission on your block, you got to work and pay
Don’t cross, any nigga in my clique, consequences deadly
I don't speak cause I ain't friendly, AK hunnid round in my clip
You spit birds, I split birds, you gon get some shit sturred
Brick Squad bangin', yeah I’m claiming, that's my wizard
Look at the toast I pack, I'm looking for the bowl
So you know the coke I snatch, throw a body in the water whatchu know bout that
Play a pirate, and I'll give you the one eye patch

I got a hunna birds, and they all dirty
I tell em fly away, I tell em fly away
I got a hunna birds, and they go for 30
I tell em come and pay, I tell em come and pay
I got a hunna birds, and they all dirty
I tell em fly away, I tell em fly away
I got a hunna birds, and they go for 30
I tell em come and pay, I tell em come and payEmbed
