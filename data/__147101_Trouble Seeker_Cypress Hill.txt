I'm on a rampage, rippin' up the damn stage
Full-time fate dealer, some say renegade
Part-time psycho, sippin' on lemonade
Don't want trouble but I'll give it to you anyway
Yes, I'm insane, put you in pain
My mind has been trained to live in the fast lane
Should I slow down? Fuckin' speed up
You better take a hit from my weed, you need some

Go hard, go hard, live hard, die hard
Rape one, cap one, fake one, slap one
Break one, jack one, save one, gat one
Rise up, rise up, take me higher

Got my hands on the wheel
And I'm never lookin' back in my rear view mirror
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
Can't eat or sleep, I need some
Medical attention, I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
You might also like
Outlaw on the chop', but I'm midnight stalker
The graveyard walker and I don't like coppers
The mic linebacker, always comin' at cha
Middle of the pig, wanna pay off disaster
Hide ya from Cypress! - All around hypin'
Songs like these keep bringing up my prices
Dog in the food in the Bob Marley hold out
Balls to the wall on a date with a student

Go hard, go hard, live hard, die hard
Rape one, cap one, fake one, slap one
Break one, jack one, save one, gat one
Rise up, rise up, take me higher

Got my hands on the wheel
And I'm never lookin' back in my rear view mirror
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
I don't care about them
And if you see me comin', actions are clear
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
They say I'm crazy, lately
I'm off the chains, don't touch me, baby
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
Can't eat or sleep, I need some
Medical attention, I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker (trouble)
I'm a trouble seeker (trouble)
I'm a trouble seeker (trouble)
I'm a trouble seeker (trouble)

Is that so? Listen in your headphones
Carvin' up your headstone, guessin' you was dead wrong
So up the heatwave! Betta learn to behave
These days we pass weed like a relay

Sorta like a hand off, then you really handle
It; you puff up a hit, then you're lit like a candle
We lead by example, you know that we are showin' proof
Gonna beat them whose are over you beat down overdue

Beat down overdue - Had to learn the hard way
Homie started flippin' and we left them in the hallway
Gonna puff all day - Shut 'em down late night
Motherfuckers wanna play, but you got stage fright

Go hard, go hard, live hard, die hard
Rape one, cap one, fake one, slap one
Break one, jack one, save one, gat one
Rise up, rise up, take me higher

Got my hands on the wheel
And I'm never lookin' back in my rear view mirror
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
I don't care about them
And if you see me comin', actions are clear
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
They say I'm crazy, lately
I'm off the chains, don't touch me, baby
(I'm a trouble seeker)
(I'm a trouble seeker)
Can't eat or sleep, I need some
Medical attention, I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seeker
I'm a trouble seekerEmbed
