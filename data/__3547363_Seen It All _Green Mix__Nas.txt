4 ContributorsSeen It All (Green Mix) Lyrics
So you know I seen it all before

I seen it all, did it all, I seen it all, did it all
Niggas talkin' it, but ain't livin' it
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all 'ill pop for a minute
Spit a sentence down the game to get rid of y'all
I seen it all, did it all, I seen it all, did it all
Niggas talkin' it, but ain't livin' it
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all 'ill pop for a minute
Spit a sentence down the game to get rid of y'all
Nas, Nas, Nas

Mets hat rocker, pretty bitch slobber
Ex-robber, heister, my own life biographer
Pants saggin', Bentley whippin', Summer Jam stopper
Ten truck, pineapple vodka, then I spray choppers
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me
 then paged me, boy  suits with Adam Stacy
Cigar like Dick Tracy, it's dark I get spacey
Alcohol and laced weed, that was part of my '80s
Them Cartier consigliere's,  me
Canary  in my pink 
Liz Taylor tried to  me
'cause I keep it green like the other side of Bill Bixby (Don't stop)
When he gets mean, think fast 'fore I blast hoes like Grassy Knoll
Went from scraggly old clothes
To the illest fashion of realest rappin'
Pablo, back on the scene, 
Strictly paper, cruising through the strip in Vegas
Two of New York's biggest, niggas, y'all you used to hate us
But now you love us, Nas and Green, power hustlers
Power hustlers, power power hustlers
Na-Na-Nas and Green, po-po-power hustlers
You might also like
I seen it all, did it all, I seen it all, did it all
Niggas talkin' it, but ain't livin' it
I seen it all, did it all
Most of y'all 'ill pop for a minute
Spit a sentence down the game to get rid of y'allEmbed
