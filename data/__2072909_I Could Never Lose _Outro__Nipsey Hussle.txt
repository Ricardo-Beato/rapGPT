7 ContributorsI Could Never Lose (Outro) Lyrics
Pride on the line
Back to the wall
Everything I got, I'm gon' give it all
Only one shot, so I'm going hard
Everything I got, I'm gon' give it all

Cause I can never I lose
I can I can never lose
I can never lose
I can I can never lose
I can never lose
I can I can never lose
I can never lose
I can I can never lose

Nah, nah
So if you want it then you gon' have it
If you believe it then it's gonna happen
And if you take it you ain't gotta ask it
Just if you do it, be the best at it (At it)
Just if you do it, be the best at it (At it)
Just if you do it, be the best at it (At it)
Just if you do it, be the best at it (At it)

She's been around and round the world
She ain't found nobody like me
Cause it ain't on me it's inside me
She's been around and round the world
She ain't found nobody like me
Cause it ain't on me it's inside me

What's the difference between me and you?
See me, I got to win so I could never lose
What's the difference between me and you?
I'm number one, one, one, one, one
What's the difference between me and you?
See me, I got to win so I could never lose
What's the difference between me and you?
I'm number one, one, one, one, one

Back to the wall

Everything I got, I'm gon' give it all

Cause I can never I lose
I can I can never lose
I can never lose
I can I can never lose
I can never lose
I can I can never lose
I can never lose
I can I can never lose

Nah, nah
So if you want it then you gon' have it
If you believe it then it's gon' happen
And if you take it you ain't gotta ask it
Just if you do it, be the best at it (At it)
Just if you do it, be the best at it (At it)
