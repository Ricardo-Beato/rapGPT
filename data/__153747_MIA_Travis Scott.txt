M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-I-M-I-M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-MI-M-I-M-I-A-MI

Lifted, I'm feelin' so gifted, trippin', I'm constantly fallin'
Channel view of the whole villa, plottin' while burnin' a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whippin' the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, and she's Lamb' fam
Whippin' trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway
For the line, listen, pimpin'
Your bitch just might physic my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up, crib look like the tele
Left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth
I copped it but now I don't miss it
Whoever found it, teeth probably glistenin'
In fact that nigga prolly missin'
You might also like
These choppers and these planes
They all doin' the same, they take me overseas
M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-I-M-I-M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-MI-M-I-M-I-A-MI
These choppers and these planes
They all doin' the same, they take me overseas
M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-MI-M-I-M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-MI-M-I-M-I-A-I-I
Speedin', and damn I'm leanin' on a Kawasaki
In the lobby, then we 'dro codeinin', out in Abu Dhabi
Chain beamin', man, I hope you ain't anemic
'Cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, it's just me and four women
And we all playin' hockey
Blowed, Scott La Flame, pimp with no cane
Rockin' a robe in your hood with no pass
Fuck up the flow, nothin' but fam 'cause niggas be hoes
You can have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ
When I stock it up and then rack it up and then go
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs
My nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho house
Spillin' booze where the Barbie at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga
Take a picture of somethin', where your Kodak at?
If Scottie ain't totin' or swimmin' in women
He writin', producin' and scorin' and filmin'
These choppers and these planes
They all doin' the same, they take me overseas
M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-I-M-I-M-I-A-I-M-I-A
M-I-A-MI-M-I-M-I-A-MI
These choppers and these planes
They all doin' the same, they take me overseas
M-I-A-I-M-I-A
