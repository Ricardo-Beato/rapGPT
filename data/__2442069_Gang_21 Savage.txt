Gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang

Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Bitch, you can't hang with the gang
I don't give a fuck 'bout no stain
Ran off with your money, you lame
And then I went bought me a chain
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
I pull up and fuck on your main
That Rollie that's on me, it's plain
My shooters, they cock it and aim
Then send a few shots at your brain

I pull up and fuck on your main, 21, nigga, the gang
I know a few niggas who changed, I could never ever ever change
Hit the cup and switch lanes
Hit the gas and switch lanes
I'm nothin' like these lames
I really sold cocaine
I run up a check and I fuck it up
I fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up
You play with the gang, we gon' fuck you up
You know that we strapped, nigga, buckle up
I cut on the stove and the water
Them diamonds, they on me, they water
I don't give a fuck 'bout your daughter
You play with the gang, you get slaughtered
That's 200 hunnid Thousand in cash
200 all over my dash, 12 get behind me, I smash
These niggas, they try to be friendly
You know that these bitches, they friendly
We not gon' show you no pity
Pull up and murder your bity
You might also like
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Bitch, you can't hang with the gang
I don't give a fuck 'bout no stain
Ran off with your money, you lame
And then I went bought me a chain
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
I pull up and fuck on your main
That Rollie that's on me, it's plain
My shooters, they cock it and aim
Then send a few shots at your brain

I don't give a fuck 'bout no mo'fuckin' stain
Ran off on my plug and I bought me a chain
A watch and a ring, a watch and a ring?
