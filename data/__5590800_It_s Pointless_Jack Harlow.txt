4 ContributorsIt’s Pointless Lyrics
Pat White

I used to know that I could rap, now I know I'm a prodigy
Lately I’ve been feeling, emotionless honestly
So I'm thinkin' with my head, ’cause I know where I gotta be
When I put my mind to it, man, no one is stoppin' me, but
I don't wanna talk about my aspirations
'Cause sometimes, I be havin' trouble havin' patience
I'm an aggravatin', masturbatin’, rap sensation with the swagger of a premature ejaculation
Uncontrollable, and I don’t know when to stop
As long as the beat's playin’, man, the flow doesn't stop
When I roll down the block, all the bros wanna talk
And tell me, how they're tryin' not to get exposed by the cops like
"I’m really getting sick of this place"
"I gotta blow up on that dro to help me get through the day"
"I can't trust the government because the system is fake"
"And if I have to break the law, well that's a risk Imma take"

Chillin' with the bros, I think we're 'bout to go somewhere but really I don't know
We're all about as flexible as acrobats, and I'm just waitin' on this girl to Snapchat me back
We're kinda friends, but at the same time we're not
'Cause I'm pretty sure she knows that I think she's hot
I try not to make it awkward at all, but, you know?
Just forget it, let's get on with the song
You might also like
I'm a sneaky young fella, but they never notice
I be stealing Wi-Fi if that network open
I be Edgar Poe'n, with them clever poems
She said my pale skin make me look like Edward Cullen
It's like Guinness when you talkin', record broken
They try to understand, but won't ever know it
So give it up one time for my side of town
Mean-muggin' other people when I ride around
Now it's the H-A-R-L-O dubs
Flow so tight it never felt so snug
Felt my cell-phone buzz over a elbow nudge
I be dishin' out that dope but don't sell no drugs
But I'm sneakin' 'round the city while I'm lurkin' in these alleyways
Everybody act the same, wishin' they was out of place
Proud to say I'm doing me, only me for what it's worth
Sick enough to buss a verse that make your fuckin' stomach hurt

Chillin' with the bros, I think we're 'bout to go somewhere but really I don't know
We're all about as flexible as acrobats, and I'm just waitin' on this girl to Snapchat me back
We're kinda friends, but at the same time we're not
'Cause I'm pretty sure she knows that I think she's hot
I try not to make it awkward at all, but, you know?
Just forget it, let's get on with the song
I'm just tryna give 'em lyrics that they could pass on
Perfectin' every line when I'm makin' rap songs
But perfection ain't perfect if it's takin' that long
Lazy with my retainer so my braces back on
But I look good, I feel nice, the weathers' amazing
I'm becomin' a man, I'm gettin' better at shavin'
I'm feelin' handsome at the moment, borderline sort of fly
Can't wait until my facial structure gets more defined
And I shed a little baby fat, ooh I think I'm Johnny Depp
Ask 'em when I'm finna make it, man I swear I'm probably next
I promise that you not as fresh
I'm going hard, you not a wreck
Stop a check, detail-oriented 'til it's all correct
I know that I suck  I know I'm appealing
Everybody sees me different, I'm a social chameleon
You might want an explanation for the things that you are seein'
Just know I'm a extraordinary human being

Chillin' with the bros, I think we're 'bout to go somewhere but really I don't know
We're all about as flexible as acrobats, and I'm just waitin' on this girl to Snapchat me back
We're kinda friends, but at the same time we're not
'Cause I'm pretty sure she knows that I think she's hot
I try not to make it awkward at all, but, you know?
Just forget it, let's get on with the songEmbed
