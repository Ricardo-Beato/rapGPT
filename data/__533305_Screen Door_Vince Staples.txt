What's the word, what's the word, what's the word, what's the word?
You are now about to witness the strength of narcotics

Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for
Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for

Bobby Johnson ain't my OG, this ain't no movie role
Pop's was off that O.E., trippin', gettin' his Tookie on
Thunderbird with Gold D's, a felon and parolee
McDonald's for the Double Cheese, pockets fit a couple C—
Notes up on the screen door saying to pack it up and leave
But we don’t read those
'Cause the money comin' faster than your bitch, nigga
All my life, I wanted to be a rich nigga
But homie, let me proceed
Pops was moving slowpoke, that's way before the codeine
Just methadone and powdered H to junkies with the sour faces
Knocking on the screen door, asking for their homie Nate
Ten to twenty each, 4 p.m. he leave, so don't be late
Mom up off of work asking me if anybody came
To kick it with my dad, or was he chilling in the alleyway?
"He was in the alleyway"—that's what he always had me say
Slangin' for them bills he had to pay—somebody at the door

Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for
Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for
Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for
Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for

Pots on top of the furnace, Glocks on top of the kitchen
Table-tables is turning, now my father is tripping
He shooting, sniffing, and sipping, pigs recruiting 'em snitches
'Cause testimonies from homies can lead to longer convictions
Police knocking at my door, pretending nobody hear 'em
Police knocking down my door with judicial system permission
Contraband in where we living, hope I don't get thrown away
In the prison, dogs are sniffing, backyard full of K's
Catch a case and knock it out, niggas fighting every day
Choppers circle 'cause a nigga chop hard on the blade
Got broads on the base, slanging rude, we banging too
Where you from? If they got that back, we clapping, coming through
Going dumb, forties, selling water, profit from the slums
Since we was young, money been the motive
Nigga, get you some guns and dope
Bruh, I love them guns and dope, find me slanging for the low
Come around, you getting domed, somebody at the door
Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for
Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for
Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for
Who's that peeking in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for

Hanh? Hello? (What's the word?)
Fuck is you doing, man? (Brrp-brrp!)
Qué pasa, Gotti? What's bracking? (Hanh?)
Got five muhfuckers down with that on-dizzy
You know? 'Cause we really out here trippin', my nigga, you know what I'm sayin'? (What's the word?)
Right here wildin', my G (Brrp-brrp!)
Whatever you need, I got it
Just come with them ends (Ayy!)
Or get socked on! Hanh? Ayy!
