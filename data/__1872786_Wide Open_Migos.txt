10 ContributorsWide Open Lyrics
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open

Wet just like an ocean, she gon' let me slide on it
Forgiato tires, I'mma let you ride on it
Tambourine with that ass, she gon' shake that ass on me
Feel like Juvenile, baby, back that ass on me
Pocket full of cheese, yeah, sloppy macaroni
I fucked her on a Tuesday, shout out Makonnen
Performin' on stage, no safety on the pistol
Lil' mama whispering niggas plottin' in the V.I.P
Pulled out, I gave her a hunnid just to tip her
Gotta know she real bad, I leave the club, I miss her
Bounce that ass ho, boing boing, pogo
Throw the profit on lil mama, cuz she make me more
She a trap girl she like blue strip hundos
She no fuckin' with if you broke oh no, no, no, no
Bounce that ass like a trampoline
Throw the money in the air like it got wings
You might also like
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open

Work, twerk, go berzerk in your vert
Skurt, skurt, pop it nasty in that mini skirt
Mr. Perfect, she perfect, I call her Mrs. Perfect
My neck lookin' like Mr. T, my hands is lookin' like James Worthy
Pop it, pop it, I gon' throw out the guala
Don't make it rain I make it thunder
I'm slappin' ass like E. Honda
My diamonds look like Willy Wonka
She got that body from her momma
She strippin and fuckin' the owner
She poppin', I'm throwin' some commas
She droppin' it just like it's hydraulics
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open1Embed
