4 ContributorsWeed Man Lyrics(*Inhale, exhale repeated throughout intro*)
(Intro: B-Real)
You know, there are times when, you run out of weed
There's no one you can call
But at last there is one person you can call - Weed Man
(B-Real)
I've had drop dates with no weed to smoke
No roaches, no nothin' when I need to toke
Damn, where can I find some shit to puff on
Damn I need the kye cause it's gettin' tough on me (me)
Cause I'm a lumberjack and tree's
Get chopped up and packed up and sold to D
Bolo's are free, did you hold one fee?
Herchers for the herbics no waterin' the seeds
Some of your friends just really see me
Cause sussin' this, losin' no GHC
The pigs always wanna PH me, my gush hits harder than some GHB
But some of these swine wanna hit off mine
I just sit back, recline, and never waste time
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man
Call me and all inhale- "The Weed Man"
(Chorus: Sen Dog)
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
You might also like(B-Real)
You can always call me all day, all light
Service with a smile, make you feel all right (yeah!)
From college-heads, co-ex and dreadlocks
Lawyers, teachers, doctors buy my stock
So many call on me for what I got
So many try to compete to take my spot
Caked out, how many dimes dropped?
How many times I lost one of my plots?
The competiton was to knock me out
The D.E.A. want to lock me out
Broke in my home tryin' to sock me out
But the true blue stoners never locked me out
I'm easy to find, call me whenever
You need some green and I'll make you feel better
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man
Call me and inhale - "The Weed Man"
(Chorus: Sen Dog)
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(B-Real)
I'm the most well-loved, bringin' the bud
Stickin' the club up, everybody ridin' my nuts
What? You say you want credit? You must be high
There's no free rides on my supply
Unless you're one of my friends you need no ends
Just sit back and wait for the joint to begin
But if you know someone in need of this weed leaf
You can take my number down and beep me
I'll hook you up if you look me up
Just don't give my number to a rookie huh!
Then I'll cut you off and brush you off
Never trust you and won't dicuss your loss
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man
Call me and inhale - "The Weed Man"
(Chorus: Sen Dog)
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!!
(Outro: B-Real)
There it is motherfuckers, you run out of weed
Call somebody like me and I'll hook you up
No stems, no seeds and things that you don't need
That's right! I'm the Weed Man
Don't trip I got gush, for a high price ho...Embed
