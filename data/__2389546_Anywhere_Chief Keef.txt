Pull that shit
They got all the fuckin' shit
Make it harder for that shit
Make it harder for that...
Make it harder for that shit
Make it harder for that...
Make it... I go anywhere, ayy
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, sk-sk-skrrt, skrrt, sk-skrrt, sk-sk-skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, ayy, ayy, ayy

I go anywhere for some fees (For some fees)
I go anywhere smoking trees (Smoking trees)
I go anywhere with my G's (With my G's)
G-L-O-G-A-N-G (G-L-O-G-A-N-G)
I go anywhere for some cheese (For some cheese)
I go anywhere we can meet (We can meet)
I go everywhere with my heat (With my heat)
I go everywhere with my piece (With my pieces)

Look at my pieces (Look at my pieces)
The diamonds turn to pieces (Diamonds turn to pieces)
It's all up in my necklace (All up in my necklace)
I feel like I'm neckless (I think that I'm neckless)
Bitch, I'm a genius (A genius)
I gotta thank Jesus (Jesus)
Jesus (Jesus)
When you getting money, they hate you (They hate you, hate)
I don't give a fuck (Give a mothafuck)
I still keep my pistol tucked (Mothafucking pistol tucked)
I still let my pistol blow (My pistol blow)
And I still hop in my truck (In my truck, hmm)

Go to sleep, I be dreaming (dreaming)
Of a hundred fucking bills (Bills)
Hundred fucking mills (Them M's)

Now that I get benjis (Benjis)
When I was broke (I was broke)
I swear I think that I was a joke (Swear that I think I was a joke)
