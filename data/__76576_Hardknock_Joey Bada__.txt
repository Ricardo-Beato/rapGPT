Check it, word, word
What's the word, word?
Yeah
Check

Just got word
From my mans on the island, he said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wylin', he look to God but can't find Him
So he demand silence from the glaring sirens
The sympathy symphony, only thing playin' is the banned violence
No lyin', niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn your molecules until you let go ions
Treat beef like they let go lions, so don't eye 'em
They get the wrong message, wrong methods put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure, God bless ya when the semi wet ya
They told me, "more dress-up", I'm giving too many lectures
And I'm puttin' in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like they gon' catch up, fuck what you must heard!
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listening to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressin' and shine, it's fine

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff (Check)
But I just can't live my life like this
You might also like
Got a collect call
From up top, my cousin called me and whatnot
The motto never changed, it’s still fuck cops
We went from having lunch in our lunchbox
Our lungs was hot whenever we'd puff pot
We'd touch blocks and end up havin' to duck shots
But fuck that, ain’t tryin' live that life no more
My mind corrupted, but my heart is still pure, gotta be brave, can’t be afraid
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
Trapped in a maze, and your faith is your only escape
Fuck a priest’s opinion, knock the hinges off of Heaven’s gates
Tryna share my cells with my mate, not share a cell with mates
Wreckin' shit with my recklessness
The L get lit, that’s when I start second-guessin' shit
Thinkin' 'bout Ty, and then I reminisce
What you thought? You niggas could’ve fuck me over? Never, nigga, guess again
I’m street, so cross me like pedestrians
And that’s gon' be the end of it, straight revokin' your membership

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna know what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this
Niggas wanna know
What I’m about; I’m 'bout blowin' loud
On the block sporty, Glock 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out commission with my composition
Who the kid spittin' behind the bars like a con position?
Gotta give ‘em time to listen, they’ll soon bump to it
They’ll like me, I kick it like Nike, they’ll soon adjust to it
But if you hate, I know you must do it
I ain’t mad at you, I keep my attitude on "screw it, a million bucks should do it"
I’m out for presidents to represent me
Yo' chick keep messagin' me, "Who the bestest MC?" They be mentionin' me
Too hot, I be molestin' the beat
Fuck math, teachers should teach us to get Smith & Wesson’s off of the street
So first-class be a lesson for me
Fuck what you teachin' for some regents, I'm flyin' over regions
Reachin' all-time highs where Jesus can’t reach us
Censor me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers, hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot, Glock cocked, watchin' out for cops
All about their cheddar, young guns know nothing that’s better
Like fuck a prison letter, those Beretta’s led us to the lettuce
Relish fetishes, menaces want the senator’s percentages
If you ain't prejudice, you still a nemesis
Smokin' on the Clematis, get open like a present is
Now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linkin' terrorists from the Stuy to Lincoln Terraces
Stay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead
Kids don’t play, they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slingin' some regs, poppin' some meds
Jakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds
I be backstage grippin' haze, breakin' my leg
My folks was makin' the best when they was naked in bed, motherfucker
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this115Embed
