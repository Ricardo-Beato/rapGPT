19 ContributorsVirgin Lyrics
(We got London on da Track)

See, my girlfriend is Italian and my car Italian too
Ferrari wagon with the stallion, I got on ten rose gold medallions
And plus Guwop eat racks for breakfast, bitch, you know I dine with champions (Champ)
Supercharge my old Camero, pull up and I'm smashing it (Woo)
Watch and chain and ring Lil Darryl, I got a retarded wrist
Them rings and bracelets Jackie Chan 'cause, man, they do karate kicks
All my hoes wear bodysuits and all my cars got body kits (Pull up)
And yeah I got it, ain't fucked up 'bout it, and I don't care none 'bout a bitch (No)
Catch you at the drive-thru, put that pistol on you, take your shit
He said, "I'm just a Black brother like you," what you try to kick some knowledge, nigga?
Matter fact, order a double decker, double stack with cheese, bitch (Don't forget the cheese, fuck nigga)
And if you pull a trick and blow my lick, then I'ma squeeze, bitch

Baby girl ain't no virgin (Burr)

Shoot a snitch leavin' court like Nino (Bah), Dolce and Gabbana tuxedo (Woah)
Garbage bag full of cheese, got a big bag of Cheetos
Hit him with that .50 cal two times, pair of free throws (Free throws)
Live from Castalia, in my trap with a pair of freak hoes (Woah)
These pistols right here, they for anybody, they some freak hoes (Stupid)
Thousand-dollar straps, nigga, I don't fuck with cheap hoes
Your bitch a freak for certain (Certain), me and my niggas workin' (We workin')
Never let a nigga fuck me out my money, I'm a virgin (Uh-huh)
Hood rich nigga, but I still eat Church's (Uh-huh)
That hoe ain't gettin' no money, don't need her around me 'cause she worthless (Hell nah)

Last verse, should've went first, hearse
Talkin' slick, get your fuckin' gums burst (Sheesh)
These bitches just turn into green just like fuckin' turf
These bitches, they give me massages like a fuckin' nurse
Huh? Ten-seven, that's that coca-yola
All my bitches smell like flowers, just like lotus (Woo)
Calm down, stand down, man down
Ambulance at the circus, dead clown (Blatt)
I'm a rich nigga, but my bitch booty big like burgers
I've been servin', so you know my strap ain't no virgin
I sneak the bitch a molly-olly, that's her main purpose
She got a twenty-five like Christmas inside of her purses
