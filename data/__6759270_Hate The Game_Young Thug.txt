I fucked her the first night and then I never called again
Next time lil' shawty seen me, I was ridin' with her friend
This alligator Kelly, not the Stacy, please
Do not hate me, hate the game, baby

Do not hate me, hate the game, baby
Do not hate me, hate the game, baby
Hopped out the Lamborghini and she ate me
All this water on my sleeve, I need a jet ski (Yes, sir)

Hopped off a Delta to a private jet (Hopped off)
Cocked that Beretta then I shot his neck (Grrah)
Green face AP, I'm 'bout to call it Shrek (Green, green)
Throw me a baddie and I caught the catch (Go)
How you don't hate the game and hate me? (Me)
Lot of flaw and misconceptions what it be (Yeah)
I done came back from the dust, wipe off the leaves (Yeah)
I don't want none of these sluts from off the streets

I fucked her the first night and then I never called again
Next time lil' shawty seen me, I was ridin' with her friend
This alligator Kelly, not the Stacy, please
Do not hate me, hate the game, baby

A nigga gettin' so big, I gotta get drove 'round by the law
Got tattoos up her sleeve, we on a shoppin' spree
Do not hate me, hate the game, baby

I just left the Cullinan up at Copper Cove (Skrrt-skrrt)
Rolls-Royce sittin' on my wrist, and, yes, it plain gold (Oh, oh)
I told that bitch, "Don't fall for that lil' chainsaw" (Oh, oh)
Turn it on from off and cut your name out (Yeah)
My watch and my rings and my chains cost (Oh, oh)
My boxers and my tank, they done came off (Oh, oh)
Fuck cops, 'til then I bang with my thang up (Yeah)
I drannk sauces, yeah-yeah, yeah (Oh, oh)
