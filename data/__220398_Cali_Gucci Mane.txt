12 ContributorsCali Lyrics
Mustard on the beat, ho

OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
Going back to Cali (I'm going, I'm going)
I am not a rapper (uhuh uhuh)
I got OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
Going back to Cali (I'm going, I'm going)
I am not a rapper (uhuh uhuh)
I got OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
I got OG bags from Cali, OG bags from Cali
Nigga OG bags from Cali, OG bags from Cali nigga
OG bags from Cali, OG bags from Cali
And I am not a rapper

Sun Valley to Cali, went from huaraches to Bally
Pop your pussy for papi, she put a break in the bust
Gave her three bricks of the heron and told her act like you're pregnant
I eat roxys for breakfast
Plug in Cali not Texas
I've got a girl that could tote it
Airport it, she float it
It's way less risk than the postal
She fake it, act like she blowed it
Got a connect on the open
More power than Oprah
I got 500 OG's in the game, task force don't even know it
Man I'm a wiz with the dope
I'm plug with the smoke
I'm tryna' lock down the city then I'mma lock down the coast
And I'm El Chapo with the choppas
Knock the meat out your taco
And I'm in Scooter durango
I got 20 rectangle
You might also like
OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
Going back to Cali (I'm going, I'm going)
I am not a rapper (uhuh uhuh)
I got OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
Going back to Cali (I'm going, I'm going)
I am not a rapper (uhuh uhuh)
I got OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
I got OG bags from Cali, OG bags from Cali
Nigga OG bags from Cali, OG bags from Cali nigga
OG bags from Cali, OG bags from Cali
And I am not a rapper

Money, walking in my Bally, smoking on a pound of Cali
OG kush that's all I smoke
That blue dream bullshit you can have it
Ran off on my plug from Cali
He was doing too much camping
 had to work my magic
Put 448 in every wrapper
Nigga that's what a pound weigh
Swag, bells and bricks of yay
10 inch blunts, we roll em up the long way
Yea, I'm smoking on that California
I got some gutter bitches, most of my bitches foreign
Yea, I wake up count my money every morning
Got a house full of gass but ain't no stoves homie
We got cheap cheap prices, jug house rolling
Racks stacked to the ceiling, banks came for it
OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
Going back to Cali (I'm going, I'm going)
I am not a rapper (uhuh uhuh)
I got OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
Going back to Cali (I'm going, I'm going)
I am not a rapper (uhuh uhuh)
I got OG bags from Cali (OG, OG)
I got OG bags from Cali, OG bags from Cali
Nigga OG bags from Cali, OG bags from Cali nigga
OG bags from Cali, OG bags from Cali
And I am not a rapperEmbed
