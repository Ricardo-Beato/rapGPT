Yo
We be blazin' (Uh)
So amazin' (Yeah)
Everybody get down
Everybody get down (Uh, yeah)
We be blazin' (Ug)
So amazin' (C'mon, uh)
Everybody get down
Everybody get down
Yeah

New year, new record, time to do bigger shit
Caught a plane to Cali linked with my nigga Quik
I figure with the combination we bomb the nation but stay calm and patient
As the world get hyped from hearin our musical conversation
This a beautiful situation right here
Givin' birth on the track 'cause the cypher stay pregnant with ideas
And we rockin it, rock, rock, rockin' it
Tell the hater players put a sock in it
Proper shit, that you got to get, 'cause we properly document
How cats look more like dicks than the Washington Monument
Validly try to challenge me, but who you racin wit'
It's amazing the lyrical lingerie I be lacin shit, we be blazin it
Put it in the air with the chronic
My lyrics like drugs, got you hooked on my phonics
From Brooklyn to Compton the lounge of Soundbombing
Still rockin' over "Balance & Options," now
You might also like
If you got a spliff then put it in the air
If you want a rift then put it in the air
If you shakin yo' ass, put it in the air
If you makin it last, put it in the air
If you leave the crib strapped then put it in the air
Take ya hand of your gat and put it in the air
Snook your bud in the club, put it in the air
Got nuttin but love, put it in the air

They say my rhymes is too heavy, I come thicker than the fog
You get it when I retire and battle my catalogue
Writin' rhymes in my captain's log, BlackStar date
MC's fake like Egyptian gods in Stargate
Lovin the hate, bubble all types of weight in they rap
I draw blood like mosquitos y'all annoy like gnats
Pop that around the wrong cat, get laid flat
Concrete adjust to the contours in your back
Quik, where you at?

Yo, I'm in the back room makin' a run
Ain't even touched during makin' her cum
And you can catch me out in Portland with Stoudamire
Everybody doin' shows but I'm the hottest flyin'
Bitches say honest, I swear to God
So how come then believin' her is so damn hard?
Could you really blame a nigga if I fucked and skate?
You ain't even pay, that's why you flunked the date
All you did was eat salad, talk shit about niggas and drink wine
And your answer kept changin' 'cause bitch, you keep lyin'
Talkin 'bout "He make me sick
"All he do is disrespect me, keep callin' me bitch"
"And he only wanna fuck me when he off of that dope"
What the fuck you think I'm here for? Not to love you, I hope
All I'm 'bout to do is listen for a minute while I get my drink in
And introduce you to my dog Kweli and go up in it
If you got a spliff then put it in the air
If you want a rift then put it in the air
If you shakin yo' ass, put it in the air
If you makin it last, put it in the air
If you leave the crib strapped then put it in the air
Take ya hand of your gat and put it in the air
Snook your bud in the club, put it in the air
Got nuttin but love, put it in the air

C'mon
We be blazin' (C'mon)
So amazin' (Yeah)
Everybody get down
Everybody get down (Yeah, c'mon, yeah)
We be blazin' (Uh)
So amazin' (C'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
Everybody get down
Everybody get down
Now let me tell you how I am

I'm mild-mannered at day but superhero at night
I got the special invite to make your spot look right
No ice, no rain, no bottles of champagne and
Half these motherfuckers can't pronounce my name
I'm so cool while you hyper than a coffee shop
Hype niggas make girls be like "Get off me, stop"
Real niggas like thirst so of course we rock
'Cause the game unorthordox, off top
You got cold feet like I pulled off your socks
Always goin' downtown pullin' all the stops
Your breath smellin' like fish from straight off the docks
That's how you lost your spot
You too hype
If you got a spliff then put it in the air
If you want a rift then put it in the air
If you shakin yo' ass, put it in the air
If you makin it last, put it in the air
If you leave the crib strapped then put it in the air
Take ya hand of your gat and put it in the air
Snook your bud in the club, put it in the air
Got nuttin but love, put it in the air

Yeah
We be blazin' (C'mon, uh)
So amazin' (Yeah, everybody c'mon)

Everybody get down (Yo, all the people in the house)
We be blazin' (C'mon, yeah)
