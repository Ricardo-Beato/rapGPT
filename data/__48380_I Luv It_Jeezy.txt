37 ContributorsI Luv It Lyrics
Ride 'til I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it (Yeah, yeah)
And I love it (Hey, let's go)

We count hundreds on the table (Table), twenty's on the floor (Floor)
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I love it (Yeah), and I love it (Love it)
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad bitches at my show (Show)
It's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I love it (Yeah), and love it (Love it)

Once again it's on
I'm back in the motherfuckin’ booth (Booth)
These niggas still lyin', I'm the motherfuckin’ truth (Yeah)
I don't believe I need some motherfuckin’ proof
I ain't want the four-door, I copped the motherfuckin’ coupe (Haha)
They tryin' be me, I'm just tryin' be G (G)
And everything comes to the light you'll see
These niggas in the dark, baby, I'll just shine (Shine)
I do it from the heart, homie, they just rhyme (Yeah)
Check your watch, nigga, it's my time (Ayy)
Mind made up, I was on my grind (That's right)
So pay attention, yeah, you on my time
In that case, time waits for no man (Nah)
Do it again, I done that before, man (Yeah)
M.O.E., he ain't part of the program (Huh?)
Or maybe you niggas ain't listening’
Open your eyes I'm a blessing in disguise
You might also like
We count hundreds on the table (Table), twenty's on the floor (Floor)

It's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I love it (Yeah), and love it (Love it)

Yeah, I blew up but they ain't like that (That)
They switched up on me, and I ain't like that (Nah)
Sold my first brick, yeah, I came right back
Fast forward the tape, nigga, look at me now
And I never turn back, so motherfuck— that (That)
Nikes is on the ground got my head to the sky (Sky)
Smoked all day, Lord knows I stay high (High)
I stay on top, Lord knows I'm gon' try (Try)
And live for the moment, Lord knows I'm gon' die (Yeah)
And when I get to hell, Lord knows I'm gon' fry (Haha)
Woke up this mornin’, so I'm still alive ('Live)
36 O's, I sold them all for five, let's go

Been around the world, it's the same ol' caine (Caine)
Been around the world, it's the same ol' thang (True)
All the real niggas either dead or in jail
And if you're lookin’ for me, homie, I'm in the A-T-L (Haha)
You gotta play it how it go, you can't cheat on life (Damn)
Ya better drink a Red Bull, you can't sleep all life (Yeah)
I ain't tryna do you, I'm tryin' do me
Last album did two, I'm just tryin' do three (Yeah)
Fresh out the pot, yeah, the work was hard (Hard)
Ride with the top down, so I'm closer to God
My P.O. tellin’ me I need a 9 to 5
But I already got a job, and that's stayin' alive

We count hundreds on the table (Table), twenty's on the floor (Floor)
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more

And I love it (Yeah), and love it (Love it)

Ride 'til I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it (Yeah, yeah)
And I love it (Hey)
Ride 'til I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it (Yeah, yeah)
And I love it (Hey)3Embed
