Give it up, we—

Somebody tooted in the student commons
The bell rang
He went home then argued in the comments
I watched the doppler move
I watched a child get introduced to violence
I beat you to the point
My noose is golden
True and livin'
Lonesome
Pugilistic moments
Riveting
Come get to know me at my innermost
My family business anguished, now I need atonement
I set the goals
Half my wings is broken
I spread the other for my brodie OD
Tiptoeing too much love
My sister showed in a rut
We getting over sinning up
Living in the moment, you been corrupt
Have some ginabut
Since a jit I figured what's the use in giving up
I can't give enough
Shilajit in my sippy cup
Healing cuts
But willingly I'm refilling the pump
No concealing it
Enemy up in arms bearing snubs
They just freakin' see the cub
My memory really leaking blood
It's congealing, stuck
Pieces in slums
One
Peaking in the dust, weaving
I remember woods
I remember endo when he wasn't remembering much
I remember love
Healing the ruptures
Feeling rushed, grew up quick
Trip around the sun, this my 25th, give it up
Gin and rum
We wasn't supposed to be alive, no funny shit

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
