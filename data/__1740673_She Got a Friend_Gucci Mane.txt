9 ContributorsShe Got a Friend Lyrics
She Gotta friend She Gotta friend
He ain't who he say he is he ain't who he say he is
I can be her friend I can be her friend
Ride in my mercedez benz you could be my lady friend
Babygirl get in babygirl get in
He ain't who he say he is he ain't who he say he is
I can be her friend I can be her friend
Ride in my mercedez benz you could be my lady friend

911 emergency drop top benz is burgany
Your girl have just been stolen from you call that shit a burglary
Her top lambo  drop to beemer later dogg
Chevy vet with stupid fruit got your wifey bucket suit
Stupid crew stupid B gucci mane that's how I live
So icey is where they at but he is not who he said he is
Think a minute baby I get money every single minute
Even when I'm sleepin money climin creepin makin entrance
Said she got a boyfriend but he ain't the kid tho
Neck cold wrist cold diamonds in my ear low
 for breakfast  for lunch
Crystal for dinner and patron for 30 blunts

She Gotta friend She Gotta friend
He ain't who he say he is he ain't who he say he is
I can be her friend I can be her friend
Ride in my mercedez benz you could be my lady friend

That's how I'm on it hatin I don't condunt it
I don't want to keep your girl I just borrow her for a moment
Bitch tell your man I bang him with this damn hammer
Fly soulja boy gucci bandana santana
I'm not attach to that you can have her back
But after this she probably don't want go back to that
Splashy flashy I'm ballin like a athlete
Belly phantom corvette that just get them all wet
All white flee of cars lookin so classy
Coming thru lookin like I just got marry
Black white all races I just like em nasty

Ride in my mercedez benz you could be my lady friend
Babygirl get in

One is in the freezer nigga, two is on deck
And when I say on deck, that means they're ready to have sex
 bottom dollar 
I give a chick a lotta hope, not a lotta dough
And if she got a partner,  treat them like domino's
Knock them down
My style 
 just to see me rock
When you see him, tell him I said, boy stop


She Gotta friend She Gotta friend
He ain't who he say he is he ain't who he say he is
I can be her friend I can be her friend
Ride in my mercedez benz you could be my lady friend
Babygirl get in babygirl get in
He ain't who he say he is he ain't who he say he is
I can be her friend I can be her friend
Ride in my mercedez benz you could be my lady friend
Babygirl get inEmbed
