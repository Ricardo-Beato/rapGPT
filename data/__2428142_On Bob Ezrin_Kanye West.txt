10 ContributorsOn Bob Ezrin LyricsHas anybody ever heard of Bob Ezrin???
What the fuck does he know about rap…
I’m tired of old people that have no connection with anything trying to comment on music!
Do something relevant… Please don’t speak on me bro ever again!!!
Your kids are ashamed of their dad…  Sorry for speaking about kids…  but could you imagine if you were Bob Ezrin’s kids…
I’m so sorry for them…   I will send them free Yeezys to make up for the embarrassment that you have caused your family!
Bro you said Macklemore was more important musically than me… no offense to Macklemore, he’s a nice human being!
Bob please never speak in public again… you are everything that is wrong with the old guard …
It’s guys like you that run companies and don’t invest in Ye even if I’m your kid’s idol!!!
Rock and Roll was stolen… Rap was exploited…
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn’t nominated for either and you know who has 2 albums of the year
Welcome to pop culture!!!
Ezrin I truly feel sorry for your friends and family that they have had to suffer an idiot like you for so many years…
