Grr
C'mon (Go)

Ain't no such thing as enough money, I want it all
A nigga showin' me how to go get it, that's somethin' I can't recall (What?)
How you never did nothing for me but tell me one for all?
"How the fuck you run up all them Ms without a Adderall?" (Uh)
That's what they ask me, came up from nothin' now I'm established (Made)
Reach for these karats and get your ears stretched, silly rabbit (Played)
I'm a dog, all bite, no bark (Grr), no fear in my heart
Lambo truck with the stars, I paid two hundred some' large
Money, bitches and chains (Ice), niggas jackin' the slang
Rose gold Rollie the only thing 'bout me plain (Pipin')
Rolls-Royce Cullinan today 'cause it might rain (C'mon)
That shit came with an umbrella, trap jumpin' like Coachella (Woo)
I'm sippin' on some clean, half my money still dirty (Woah)
They know I got a bitch, but these hoes still flirtin' (So?)
I'm in the field pissed, feel like Mike Vick, I'm quarter backin'
We be talkin' slick so charges don't stick, never lackin' (C'mon)

Money, money, money (Uh), bitches, bitches, bitches (What?)
All these fucking killers, but the jail's full of snitches (Snitches)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (Woo, c'mon)
Money, money, money (Money), bitches, bitches, bitches (Bitches)
All these fucking killers, but the jail's full of snitches (Raow)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (Woo)

When the dog get hungry, the dog gon' eat
That's when I slide my plate right under a nigga feet
Like the lines in the road, I get down in the street
Come through like "brrap," put them cats to sleep
Stay with the heat, cook niggas (Uh), shook niggas (Uh)
Me and mine come through, we nothing but crook niggas (Uh, uh)
We off the hook, nigga (What up?), everybody strip (Yeah)
Everybody get down 'cause my niggas flip (Raow)
On Jake niggas, fake niggas, snake niggas (Uh)
Make niggas rape niggas, I hate niggas (Uh)
Talking that riff-raff, get back (What?)
They call me "Extortion", nigga, I get half (Woo)

Money, money, money (Money), bitches, bitches, bitches (Bitches)
All these fucking killers, but the jail's full of snitches (Snitches)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (C'mon)
Money, money, money (Money), bitches, bitches, bitches (Bitches)
All these fucking killers (C'mon), but the jail's full of snitches (What?)
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is (Woo)2Embed
