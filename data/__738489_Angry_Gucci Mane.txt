TM, silent, it's Gucci
It's Guwop, living legend
Huh, huh, huh
Damn, huh, huh
It's Gucci

Turn me onto a big enough lick and I'ma learn to love you
Put that chopper in your name so I gotta fuck you
If you fuck my homeboy then I can never trust you
Give a shoutout to my new bitch, she a fucking hustler
I got a new bitch, I got a new bitch
Yeah I’m riding 'round the city with my new bitch
Got my old ho mad, she a broke bitch
And plus I got the kind of money that we both rich
Jump out the yacht bitch, we going shopping
I bought three cars, four she got options
I’m not popping, but she Gucci
She told me baby get them niggas, they pussy

I’m an arrogant son of a bitch
I’m a dirty son of a bitch
I can be good to you baby
I buy Roleys for the clique
I’m a neighborhood nigga
I’m a no good nigga
I fuck with Hollywood court but ain’t no Hollywood nigga
I’m  an arrogant son of a bitch
I’m a dirty son of a bitch
I can be good to you baby
I buy Roleys for the clique
I’m a neighborhood nigga
I’m a no good nigga
I fuck with Hollywood court but ain’t no Hollywood nigga
You might also like
Riding 'round LA with my new bitch
Counting blue face hundreds, hit a few licks
Hit the trap, bounce, whip a few bricks
Baby fall back, you know I does this
Think it’s all fun and games, just music
Till a nigga pull up, get to shooting
Fredo ain’t getting money, man that’s nonsense
On Front Street, got the trap jumping
I can front your work depending what you’re copping
If you run off then I’m sendin' a fucking goblin
Got Tec-9s, AKs in my closet
It’s just in case a nigga cross me on that opp shit

I’m an arrogant son of a bitch
I’m a dirty son of a bitch
I can be good to you baby
I buy Roleys for the clique
I’m a neighborhood nigga
I’m a no good nigga
I fuck with Hollywood court but ain’t no Hollywood nigga
I’m  an arrogant son of a bitch
I’m a dirty son of a bitch
I can be good to you baby
I buy Roleys for the clique
I’m a neighborhood nigga
I’m a no good nigga
I fuck with Hollywood court but ain’t no Hollywood nigga
Tell that nigga don’t ride past if he the opposite
I’m a neighborhood nigga, you an opp bitch
3 hunna, 64th, yeah we be dropping shit
She a neighborhood bitch, yeah she a block bitch
She been around the block, yeah that’s the block bitch
I spin around the block, I got my Glock and shit
Spin right back on your block, you better not be on it
Any nigga getting seen, yeah we on it
3hunna that’s the team, yeah we own it
Got killers, kill your dream, nigga we on that
It’s a hundred band jugg right there and we on that
3hunna that’s the team, yeah we own that

I’m an arrogant son of a bitch
I’m a dirty son of a bitch
I can be good to you baby
I buy Roleys for the clique
I’m a neighborhood nigga
I’m a no good nigga
I fuck with Hollywood court but ain’t no Hollywood nigga
I’m  an arrogant son of a bitch
I’m a dirty son of a bitch
I can be good to you baby
I buy Roleys for the clique
I’m a neighborhood nigga
I’m a no good nigga
I fuck with Hollywood court but ain’t no Hollywood nigga2Embed
