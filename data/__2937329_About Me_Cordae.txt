18 ContributorsAbout Me Lyrics
"Ooh, yeah, yeah"
Every time I see you
You make my heart say "Ooh yeah, yeah"
Nique Productions
"Ooh yeah, yeah"
"Ooh yeah, yeah"
"Ooh yeah, yeah"

I knew that life got its wonders I merely have to explore
You ever give someone your all and they still asking for more?
You ever witness all your dreams fucking crash through the door?
You ever have a open mind until it blast through the floor?
But I won't give my up hope, this shit is all that I got
Respect to ones who would love me whether I'm balling or not
'Cause when you fall from the top, dog, it's a hell of a crash
Ignore the haters and doubters with they irrelevant ass
Man, I just wanna make music, like fuck the cheddar and cash
'Cause it won't bring me to peace, and money never would last
I mean I'm better than that
I mean it shouldn't have changed
And I can't wait to break out and put my foot in the game
And tell them all about the song and won't mention your name, baby

I'm telling everyone I know this song is about you
And I'ma sing it all day, all night 'cause I want to
I want to tell the whole wide world 'bout your love
Your love, your love
It feels
You might also like
I heard the cage bird sing and it's a beautiful sound
But it'd be so much damn better, girl, if you was around
And I see you still got a man, but damn dude is a clown
I'm sorry that I had to look, I heard you flew through the town
But I'll settle for less, damn I'm never the best
'Cause the only thing that really lasts forever is death
Go and shoot a couple videos, wear sweaters and vest
Just to show them that I'm different and I'm clever as chess
But honestly I'm the greatest and I'll dare to admit it
But others disagree if talent don't compare with the the digits
But money don't mean shit if you can't share with your niggas
We all eat if I eat, that's something rare with these niggas
I mean why squeeze on the paper, you can't take it with you
And buying shit a stress reliver, I'm facing issues
You know you doing something right when the hate official
But please, baby, pay attention 'cause I cause pray they miss you

I'm telling everyone I know this song is about you
And I'ma sing it all day, all night 'cause I want to
I want to tell the whole wide world 'bout your love
Your love, your love
It feels

You see it's always sunshine after the rain
And it's always some crying, laughter and pain
And I don't know how to prepare for the disaster and fame
Who I go to for guidance 'cause the pastor the same
I hate the struggle and mostly just how shitty it feels
Momma car got stolen twice around Hickory Hill
And we was catching the bus, but never missing a meal
But I appreciate the times, it made a nigga for real
Moved to the burbs, necessary bettered the living
Was a wonderful choice, I don't regret the decision
Plus I made some great friends that I'm never forgetting
I got a love for the music but the pleasure is missing
Don't appreciate the art, they never treasure the vision
But I still beat the odds, I'm not dead or in prison
So I'm grateful for the days, I'm not in debt to the system
Play the song and just pledge to the rhythm
'Cause baby we going far
I'm telling everyone I know this song is about you
And I'ma sing it all day, all night 'cause I want to
I want to tell the whole wide world 'bout your love
Your love, your love
It feels good
I want to tell the whole wide world 'bout your love
Your love, your love, your love, baby2Embed
