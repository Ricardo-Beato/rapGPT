I mean really like, you know, it's kinda funny how this shit came together because, you know there was nothing behind the mixtape, it was like, I had to go, you know, do a show... it was Ludacris, Pitbull, Method Man, Redman, Keith Murray, a whole bunch of people that were gonna be there, and I had to throw something off the stage, you know what I mean? I'm tryna' get my name known, you know, so. And it was like a month before the show, my mentor hit me up and said "Yo, you gotta drop a mixtape" you know? And I said "ok". And we basically put everything together within 2-3 weeks and it was all from scratch except for about 3 songs so... that's the background story, I mean, I don't know for anybody that cares, I thought I would just tell you that so... enjoy
