22 ContributorsWhat I Claim Lyrics
Sosa
O'Block
All or nothing
Bang, bang, bang, bang bang

Smoke kush ain't comin' down, I'm wit the smoke at the top
Guns filled like cans bitch, them kind things we let it pop
Cdai got 22 shots plus Michael Jordan one through the top
It's 300, 600 shit, try that you get popped
Bullets hit your fucking chest, clips full like gas tanks
I'm on a block we call O'Block
Ride through we at your gas tanks
You don't believe that shit stank, that's when we make yo ass think
Catch up I'm too fast, that's why I'm in the fast lane
OTF that's Wiiic City
Young Money, no 5-1
Lamron, 46 shit, Sendin' shots a 051
I'm on it now wit Poo Poo and yes he will shoot you
Pop pills and shootin' niggas, swear I'm goin' coo-coo

All my niggas grimy, OTF behind me
If he don't mind me, you know where to find me
It's money over them dumb bitches, L's over them fuck niggas
In the back we go rabbit huntin'
I'ma Looney Toon better duck nigga
'Cause I'ma let this gun bang, this shit ain't for lames
It's F.T.O. in my radar, so I stay in my lane
Sosa that's my name, yo bitch screamin' my name
We can't fuck wit oppositions, nigga you can't claim what I claim
You might also like
Shoot a nigga arms off, pussy nigga can't catch now
Big clips for the set now, 89's and TEC-9's
Do it a hit on M.O.B for that that nigga Lil Steve
Pop pills and I'm movin' fast and you smell is that kush breezy
We ridin' past now bullets flyin', paralyze a nigga, make him feel me
Kill my lil bro man, yeah, y'all niggas one up
We march through yo fuckin' block, make a horror scene like monsters
Catch fam at Ace Tech, blam his ass with that nine TEC
I'm 300, I kill a nigga, yeah, I got my mindset
600 catch him at Carter, outta nowhere like the Parker
We don't turn off, we start up and every day I'm harder
A lotta niggas with a lotta guns, real niggas better follow

All my niggas grimy, OTF behind me
If he don't mind me, you know where to find me
It's money over them dumb bitches, L's over them fuck niggas
In the back we go rabbit huntin'
I'ma Looney Toon better duck nigga
'Cause I'ma let this gun bang, this shit ain't for lames
It's F.T.O. in my radar, so I stay in my lane
Sosa that's my name, yo bitch screamin' my name
We can't fuck wit oppositions, nigga you can't claim what I claim

Sosa, yeah
This shit ain't for lames
Nigga you can't claim what I claim
L's bitch, I'm insane
Yo hoe screamin' my name
Sosa that's my name
I'ma let this gun bang, so I stay in my lane
Yeah, 300, 600, I'm rockin' with y'all niggas man
Cdai, roll up nigga, bring that dope back, where the bitches at?
I'm the famous Chief Keef bitch, haha
Yeah, bang, bang, bangEmbed
