3 ContributorsToo Black Lyrics(Intro)
Do you think it is by accident that everytime
A black leader appears on the horizon
With any kind of cleverness, or charisma he's cut down?
Malcom, Martin, Leadkur, I want you to arm yourself
And I've asked Josh to be your bodyguard
All right Dason
It might be good for Joshua to seal, like he has somethin' to do
So detatched from us, these are only for you
(Snoop Dogg)
Damn, cool, good, so good, gotta do wrong
So cold should... gotta do wrong
(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
It seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
The world is filled with so much jealousy
You don't know who to trust cause you might get shot
(Snoop Dogg)
You might get got, and you might not
Make it to see a whole 'nother day, you better
Watch your hand and watch how you play
Cause you don't know how the system might get you twisted
If you don't pay attention, and you'll come up missin'
I'mma give it to you - live and direct
Cause I know, a million niggas doin' bad and they check
They game every day but they try to find a way
But somehow, some way, there ain't no pay (uh)
It's the same game, from my town to your town
From L.A. to Chi-Town, Baghdad (that's right)
To the rebel we deliver the true game
And niggas gettin' upset cause they can't maintain (player haters)
Don't get mad cause I was blessed with a gift
To give you people what you need and no more deep shit (that's right)
Lit up, get up, sit up, I write it
Then I, put you all in the mood, you invited
So come on down and party with the pound (come on)
You ain't never heard a nigga come around and put it down
Just like the Soopa-Doopa, with no Woopers
Guranteed to comin' through the party, see you visual cooper
Take her to my criz-zay, what you dizzy-in'
I ain't gonna discuss this, no more about to bust it
And when I do it, I'm gonna touch it, no discussion
It's Snoop Dogg, I got some languages aimin' for the Russians
And the overseas g's, please
Let me get you one of these with another ill beat (number two)
I gots to do ya, like ya never been done
It's Snoop Dogg representin' Funk-2-1
I'm about the gee-ist of 'em all
Can you name a rapper who can fade the dog - hell nah
And if you can - you're lyin' to yourself
And if you lyin', you're dryin' with your cover
And if you dyin, you fuckin' with your death
I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm the top rapper, at the top of the shelf
I leave these suckers in amazement, dazement
And Death Row is still the label that pays me
You might also like(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
This world is filled with so much jealousy
I don't know who to trust cause
If I trust hey I might, end up shot (end up shot, hmm)
(Snoop Dogg)
I turn to the left and I turn to the right
I see some motherfuckers 'bout to have a fight (whassup, whasssup?)
What should I do? (should I do) Should I watch, uh?
Or should I jump in? Or should I come with the Glock?
I knocks on the door, plus "Oh No"
I gots to avoid the drama and take the slow-mo
Type of approach - I'm the team and the coach
I hooks a left turn - no burn, for your concern, you gots to learn
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I'mma give you what you earned
And if you get it, watch me spit it
I'm commited to do it and I'm a still aquitted
Never ever did it, or forget it
This guranteed to keep the party hittin'
And I'mma give you people what you need
And I'mma smoke up on just like a bag of weed
And if you into the mixture and into the rapture
Just sit back and listen cause Snoop Dogg's about to catch ya
Snatch ya and adapt ya with the shit that I got (hmm-hmm)
I'm guranteed to rock the party non-stop (that's right)
You ain't never heard a rapper who can flip this script
Guranteed to make the ho's go ahead and get whipped
And when they stop rockin' - they won't
But if you fake the funk (youse a punk), then youse a punk (haha)
You gots to keep it real with yourself baby boy (boy)
Cause if you don't then you ain't labelled "The Real McCoy"
I'm Snoop Dogg, yes I'm true indeed
I'm guranteed to light it up and ride it up and side it up
I'm guarnteed to, do my thing
Everybody in the party if ya down to bang - sing
What'cha wanna do, what ya gots to
Cause this is somethin' to rock you
(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
Seems like I gotta do wrong before they notice me
This world is filled with so much jealousy
I don't know who to trust cause
If I trust either I might, end up shot or (end up shot, hmm)
Seems like, (seems like), seems like, (seems like)
I gotta do wrong
Seems like, (seems like, uh), I gotta do wrongEmbed
