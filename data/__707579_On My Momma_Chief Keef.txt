17 ContributorsOn My Momma Lyrics
I came, I saw, I conquered
Been jumped up off the porch on my momma
I ain't worried about these little bitty suckers
Cuz I'm a money getting muthafucka
Yeah, I come from the slums, yeah, I been getting money, yeah
I blow on my own, no, I don't need nobody, woo
When I pull up Glo, no, I don't see nobody
If I wasn't trappin', trappin', trappin', I swear, I won't be nobody

This nigga bitch just hit me up, she ask me what I'm doing
I say "getting to the bucks"
She told me that she wanna come through and fuck
I say "no, bitch, suck my nuts, you nuts"
What you want, what you want
You ain't talkin' money
Then you getting on me nerves, swerve, what a bird
You ain't a dog call you lil courage
Dumb muhfucker, cowardly dog
I come my cowboys shooting on purpose
You ain't  no shooter, what you shooting for Curry?
Eddy Curry, I'm eating on curry
With my granny, I got black eyed peas
Swear to god I don't need no Fergie
She say she wanna be Chief Keef wife I'm like swerve
Bitch lemme tell you what I heard
Heard that you's a motherfucking thot
You be block-to-block
Curb-to-curb
The bitch heard I got gwap
Now she wanna let me fuck, I heard I heard
Always gotta know popo my dear, tryna kick down the door
I knerr I knerr
You might also like
I came, I saw, I conquered
Been jumped up off the porch on my momma
I ain't worried about these little bitty suckers
Cuz I'm a money getting muthafucka
Yeah, I come from the slums, yeah, I been getting money, yeah
I blow on my own, no, I don't need nobody, woo
When I pull up Glo, no, I don't see nobody
If I wasn't trappin', trappin', trappin', I swear, I won't be nobody

I be getting gwap
If I was working I would fuck all my damn colleagues
Start by the nature to get my pistols
I swear they so naughty naughty
Rollin' Rollin' routin routin
You know you ain't about it Charlie
Gettin' money, spending money
You know you ain't about it dummy
I'ma come thru with the coolin' kits, ooh it's real cool
You was on that opp shit, then ooh it's kill you
I be on that loud shit, don't give a fuck who tell you
And I'm smoking on that loud shit
Don't give a fuck who smell cool
Your clique full of squares like a picture and a border
I can get some bricks and I can send em thru the border
I just got your bitch I was having fun but I got bored of her
Meet me at the border I'm at Chiraq, Drillinois
I came, I saw, I conquered
Been jumped up off the porch on my momma
I ain't worried about these little bitty suckers
Cuz I'm a money getting muthafucka
Yeah, I come from the slums, yeah, I been getting money, yeah
I blow on my own, no, I don't need nobody, woo
When I pull up Glo, no, I don't see nobody
If I wasn't trappin', trappin', trappin', I swear, I won't be nobody9Embed
