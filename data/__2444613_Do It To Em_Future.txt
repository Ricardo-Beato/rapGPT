5 ContributorsDo It To Em Lyrics
Stand over the motherfuckin' city and look down on you niggas

Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Put the VVS in my necklace had to do it to em
Don’t you see the way a nigga dress had to do it do em
Half a million ticket off finesse had to do it to em
Swaggin’ outta space I ain’t flexing I had to do it em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em

Hate I had to do it to em, but I did it to em
10 pounds of Keisha cole took it right to em
Shorted every one of them bitches like I ain’t knew em
5 extra bands hate I done ran through em
Vacuum and flipping the chickens do what I’m doing (freebandz)
50 carrots off of my wrist and see what I’m doing (freebandz)
Spending money wasting my time check my endurance
Been around the world with that girl we still tourin’
You might also like
Put the VVS in my necklace had to do it to em
Don’t you see the way a nigga dress had to do it do em
Half a million ticket off finesse had to do it to em
Swaggin’ outta space I ain’t flexing I had to do it em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em

Had to with purple label urban wear was boring
Louis my attire hate that Gucci wasn’t for me
Walk inside the club freebands got it storming
Gucci told me she a band you act like you performing
Gone park the old school its time to ride foreign
Turn it up times 10 go ahead record me
Hate I had to do it to em VVS bore me V cut flawless diamonds
Yeah these hoes adore me

Put the VVS in my necklace had to do it to em
Don’t you see the way a nigga dress had to do it do em
Half a million ticket off finesse had to do it to em
Swaggin’ outta space I ain’t flexing I had to do it em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em
Hate I Do It To Em,  Do It To Em1Embed
