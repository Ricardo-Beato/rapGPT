We here
We ain't going nowhere

Y'all motherfuckers don't know what beef is

Ha ha ha ha ha, check out this bizarre
Rapper style used by me, the B.I.G
I put my key you put your key in, money we'll be seeing
Will reach the fucking ceiling, check it
My Calico been cocked, this rap Alfred Hitchcock
Drop top notch playa hating won't stop
This instant, rappers too persistent
Quick to spit Biggie name on shit
Make my name taste like ass when you speak it
See me in the street your jewelry you can keep it
That'll be our little secret
See me B that is, I that is G whiz
Motherfuckers still in my biz
Hope they know my nigga Gutter fucking kidnap kids
Fuck em in the ass, throw em over the bridge
That's how it is, my shit is laid out
Fuck that beef shit, that shit is played out
Y'all got to go, all I make is one phone call
All y'all disapear by tomorrow
All your guns is borrowed, I don't feel sorrow
Actually your man passed the gat to me, now check this

What's beef, beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU
What's beef, beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU
Check it

I done clapped at the best of them
Been caused the death of them
These dudes don't want no more, shit is affecting them
Tops popped off, them niggas from the bridge
Just be, wildlin' on you line that red dot on you, (take that)
Don't know or warn you, catch them all hogged up
Sober that ass up with clips, the ratchet spit
Number one with the buddhaka, henny-sour diesel
Ain't no telling what I do to ya
It's obvious ma you ain't fucking keep it moving ma

Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow they shot 'em in their cars
I wish I was there, I would of shot back all em'
They fire return fire put it right back on em'
Sacrifice myself for you no problem, (no problem)
In the flames I burn for my niggas that's gone
And the niggas that took the hits on my niggas you been warned
P's not the one, Hav not the one
You try to run up on us, we already busting the guns

They'll be nothin but smooth sailing (talk to em)
When I spit shots, now your crew's bailing (y'all don't know what beef is)
All I got is heat and tough talk for you
Tie you up, cut your balls off just for you
Man this is straight torture, look what that slick shit bought ya (c'mon)
A first class ticket to Lucifer, real name Christopher (yea, Chris)
Watch me set it off like Vivica (c'mon that's right)
Here lies your demise, close your eyes (close your eyes)
Think good thoughts, die while your skin start to glisten
Pale blue hands get cold, your soul's risen (damn)
It's bad cause I just begun
What make the shit real bad I was having fun (hahaha)


Attention MCs........Attention MCs
Beef doesn't happen on records
Beef does not happen on records
You don't know what beef is, (you don't know what beef is)
You don't want no beef you fucking fake studio ass gangsta
Rapping motherfuckers!, (c'mon man)
Fuck outta here!, (fuck outta here)
Beef is B.I.G. not being here, (b.i.g. we miss you)
Beef is your love ones not being here, (we miss you)
Beef is every so-called ghetto superstar that rose
To the top and dropped just as quickly, (that's beef)
On some bullshit
What's beef 2006?
What's beef (that's beef)
Y'all motherfuckers don't know what beef is, (that's beef)
Fuck all y'all (bitches)
Bad Boy Bitch we still here3Embed
