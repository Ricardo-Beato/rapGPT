This is a Dolan Beats production

I just pull up in that old color of glue
I just spent twenty on a chain, thousand on some shoes
I done fucked every bitch you wanted to
They don't fuck with you 'cause I don't fuck with you
They like, "Chief Sosa, when we gon' hit the stu?"
I'm like, "When you put the O on the side the two"
They like, "Sosa and I got ya album too"
If I was you, bitch, I would buy it too

They like, "Sosa, you so mean to me
You don't know what you mean to me
Ever since you came in the game, you been fuckin' up the scenery"
I know, I feel like John Cena, ain't no nigga seein' me
Tryna rob me, they meet my damn Nina
Ain't a nigga gettin' a thing from me
Had to put that bitch out, she was doin' some things to me
She ain't wanna shake her ass, she wanted to sing for me
Tryna blow nigga, oh no, 'cause I brought my thing with me
I feel like G.I Joe though, I come from the meanest streets
Almighty Sosa from the O, that's what it mean to me
Ballin' with no basketball, got a basketball in my Beamer seats
Poppin' shit like vegetable oil, you poppin' shit like seeds in weed
I take the moment to thank the lord, but I pop some shit at my meet and greet
'Cause I got all this Johnny Dang on
And I got all this damn bread on
You ain't takin' shit, you can take one to the head, hom'
Now I got all this damn red on
You might also like
I just pull up in that old color of glue
I just spent twenty on a chain, thousand on some shoes
I done fucked every bitch you wanted to
They don't fuck with you 'cause I don't fuck with you
They like, "Chief Sosa, when we gon' hit the stu?"
I'm like, "When you put the O on the side the two"
They like, "Sosa and I got ya album too"
If I was you, bitch, I would buy it too

Chief Sosa shitin' on you lames, man
She like, "I know, I follow you on Instagram, Instagram"
She give me nose just like she Toucan Sam, Toucan Sam
Smokin' on this dope and I'm coughin' like damn
Bitch, stop actin' dumb, you know who I am
I be ballin' hard and flexin' no jams
And if you want a verse, send my check in the mail
You niggas ain't gon' shoot, man, you niggas gon' tell
Get yo ass smoke if you droppin' the L's
They like, "What up, Chief So?", I be boppin' the L
Get yo ass smoke if you droppin' the L's
They like, "What up, Chief So?", I be boppin' the L

I just pull up in that old color of glue
I just spent twenty on a chain, thousand on some shoes
I done fucked every bitch you wanted to
They don't fuck with you 'cause I don't fuck with you
They like, "Chief Sosa, when we gon' hit the stu?"
I'm like, "When you put the O on the side the two"
They like, "Sosa and I got ya album too"
If I was you, bitch, I would buy it too2Embed
