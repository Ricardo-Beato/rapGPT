1 Contributor2 (resPEct) LyricsDAVE CUT THE RECORD DOWN TO THE BONE
NOW HES ON THE BASS IM ON THE MICROPHONE
REAL TALK NEW YORK SO NOW WE ROCK
1 RHYME AT A TIME OLD SCHOOL DESIGN
YOU CAN DANCE TO IT ROMANCE TO IT
THROW YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR TAKE A CHANCE TO IT
RUN TILL ITS DARK KNOCK IT OUT THE PARK
ROCK THAT BOX WITH THE REAL HIP HOP
ORDODOX NOT ON MY WATCH
AINT PAYING FOR PAY TO PAY NO JOX
BEATS DOING WORK RHYMES IN REVERSE
MY HOOD IS HURT FROM ALL THE DIRT
UNDERNEATH THEM STREETS AND ALL CONCRETE
IS MOTHER EARTH FOR ALL ITS WORTH
PAY ATTENTION
CHEAPEST PRICE TO PAY
MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE
GIVE YOU ANOTHER DAY
AND ROCK ONYou might also likeEmbed
