One, two
Aw, nah

Your attention, please! Your attention, I need it
So I can sit you in a position from which I see it
Where I'm seated is scenic
Heavy-weighter, slim as the Machinist, so bulimic
Which means you somewhere in between it
I take it back for you like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas
I'm in the market for low-mile 360 Modena annd a good organic cleaners
My car always a winner
Your car's always pitted—we should call it" Stanley Steamers"
Most of my friends in gangs
My new nickname is Genghis Khan—
But without the 'Ye, but his last name's my side
I ride with the meanest
I'm armed to the teeth
You're Venus, and you've never been to the dentist
School of Hard Knocks, I dean it
I done it, as well as a celebrated alumnus
I donate to the campus, and my name's on the arenas
But you can't bring it to my court—not even with subpoenas
'Cause you can't play my sport, but you can still cheerlead us
And you can't sit there—that section's for the seniors
And the sexy señoritas, so, just move up to the bleachers
How you gonna school me when I grew up with your teachers?
I know that you can't hear me 'cause I blew up all the speakers
And the power line is hanging 'cause I threw up all the sneakers
I ate up the imposters and I chewed through all the pizzas
I blacked out with a black card and I maxed out all the Visas, ugh
Accreditation so prestigious
Just walk across my stage—your life will be completed
Don't need financial aid, 'cause this is just some free shit
You been properly prepared, throw your hats up in the air
I'm red hot, Chilly—I'm Anthony Kiedis
My spirit smells teenage, and Chi-Town's feeling excellent
We hit them with the President—see, we set the precedent
I don't feel I'm best, I just feel I'm better than...

Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on

See I don't disagree, this is just a grievance
This ain't dissing; this is civil disobedience
How you gon' make hip-hop without all the ingredients?
Lot of mouths to feed, plus, a lot of greediness
And that greed outshines the neediness
What niggas need is some "question the authority and tune out all the TV" shit
And we be this
So I give 'em more—you see, I did it for...

Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

Yeah, I am back up on the airwaves
Feeling like a Soldier, and I ain't talking where the Bears play
Flair—look how I Fred Astaire down the staircase
It's finna be a hair-raising tortoise-versus-hare race
So you should hang around here, like some earrings
I know attention's all about how you pair things
So, when I want them to hear me out
I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
And what's written on her titties is what it's really about
Then, her vagina is some poor kids from China
Nipples, nuclear missiles
Ass is a daughter without a dad
Back is like Afghanistan, Iraq
Health care hair, drive-by thighs
Education lips, HIV eyes
Environment feet; justice get her so wet
Brains get you brains, you can fuck her if you protest
But before you bust in her face
Finish listening to the tape: Enemy of the State2Embed
