Can’t sing a song to save your life
But can you sing a song to save a life
Can a song save the world in this time of 45
45 beyond askin’
Can hip hop survive?
Over a million rappers spittin’ now
What we the people be gettin’
Forgettin’ armaggedon
Look out love is the message you can bet on
Can culture save humanity when the name of the game
Is narcissism, yo how can musicians get paid?
Curator, caretaker, this creator
Servicing purpose to other creators
Rhymers and beat makers
Blessed by the internet
So I’mma start this war of art
Before they rip this world apart
Toxic

Toxic, see em
Sell it and box it

Say we can’t stop it
Flav, PE, rock it

Looks like 45 done lied again
Grabbin’ planets, territories
Not to mention women
Those who voted this POTUS
Killin’ kin for the win
Citizens sufferin’
While he be ballin’
If a mule die, they used to say
Buy another one
If a nigga die, they used to say
Try another one
Fifty years we were broke, not broken
Take me to your leader
Even aliens spoke it
Every treaty signed
Their fuckery broke it
Wonder why only a few of us
Thrive as their tokens
Toke this toke that
No joke cause I wrote it
The only thing I hit is the stage, and I smoke it
Yo that
That shit sounded good on the record, what you just did, ahah

Toxic, see em

Hindsight 57
So I’m stayin’ in my lane
As the young think in hell
And the old prey to pain
This shit is classic like the resurgence
Of the dope on plastic
Vinyl bats backin’ the tracks
The millennium’s drastic
Synthetic bullshit smokin’ up the hood
Bear witness cause y’all know the government’s up to no good
You can’t drift away from the problems of today
If you’re grown 21 and over, tell me where the hell you goin’
Suicidal with an open Bible
Lockdown friendly fire
Or HBO, Home Boys Only, I really never really dug the Wire
They do no hirin’
He keep on firin’
We keep dyin’
The aftermath
Do the math
