Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
It got me smiling like it's diamonds in my mouth
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Cause it's a drought but I'm not never running out
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Marijuana war I'll burn your crop down
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
I'm stashing bricks and pounds, the drought I'll bring 'em out

Ever since that shootout I've been shot out ever since
No cash for the holiday he looking for a lick
Country boy a tourist say he looking for a brick
He must think this a movie now he tied up in the 6
Ever since that murder I've been shot out ever since
Shot at me and missed they let me go that self defence
El Gato, Chapo call him having him tryin' to jump the fence
Shooters all up from me told 'em burn 'em with the stick
I thought if I got 20 mil that I would go legit
Soon as I got that 20 mil I bought a thousand bricks
Bought my bitch a dog named Dollar, Gucci richy-rich
Tailored in that Steve Harvey, homie you the weakest snitch
You might also like
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
It got me smiling like it's diamonds in my mouth
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Cause it's a drought but I'm not ever running out
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Marijuana war I'll burn your crop down
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
I'm stashing bricks and pounds, the drought I'll bring 'em out

Bullets break your vertebrae, goons increase the murder rate
Pulling up with urgency, I cut the dope like surgery
Niggas say we skimped them, bitches say I pimped them
Robbers say I tempt them, diamonds give you symptoms
Couple people know him, X him with the O him
We know that you told, let the paperwork expose him
Penthouse at the Twelve the neighbors tripping bout the odor
Bitch I know you fucking off you just fucked the promoter
Diamonds in my motor, diamonds on my choker
All these hundreds on me bitch I feel like a promoter
I fucked her too but when I see her act like I don't know her
See you later alligator bout to meet with Oprah

Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
It got me smiling like it's diamonds in my mouth
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Cause it's a drought but I'm not ever running out
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Marijuana war I'll burn your crop down
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
I'm stashing bricks and pounds, the drought I'll bring 'em out1Embed
