Say man
Lemme-lemme get a light homey (Yeah!)
Ay, ay Timbo, this yo' crippin cousin Snoop Dogg cuzz! (Yeah!)
I told you we gotta get gorilla on this one right here man
Take 'em to the zoo!
To the L.A. zoo, take these niggas to the L.A. zoo
Haha, yeah nigga, 'bout to get
Ape shit crazy in here in a long time (Snoop Dogg!)
Dig this, uh

I need a light, let me step up in this motherfucker 'til I get it right
(Get it right Dogg!)
I need a light, let me lean, make it bright, everythang is dynamite
(Ahhhh true!)
Bust a bitch, tryna feel like a pimp would
It's Snoop D O Double G, I'm in ya neighborhood
I make it crack-a-lack, do it just like that
Take a sip of this, nigga have a puff of that
You had enough of that? Yeah, give it right back
Now lay ya head back and roll in the Cadillac
How we do what we do, what it is, where it's goin' down.. and the
Motherfuckers flip it
Rip it, get specific, and dip it and then they drip it
Cause you know we like to pop it cause you talkin' so different
Fix your Focus and ride, I want the bangers to bang
Or get hyphy with my niggas up north by the Bay
Tryna twist in my whip, I got the big body Benz
Cause I'm rollin with my nephew and we smokin again
"Turn your music down low, man yo' shit too loud!"
What the fuck you talkin 'bout, I put my gun in yo' mouth nigga! (In yo' mouth!)

Niggas better get it right
Let me get a light, nigga let me get a light! (Get it right Dogg!)
Yeah, better get it right
Nigga let me get a light, homey let me get a light!
To get it tight they gotta get a light
Well, to get it tight they gotta get a light! (Get it right Dogg!)
To get it tight they gotta get a light
No, to get it tight they gotta get a light!

Hip-Hop! I ball like a split end, I'm all like I been in
I'm tryna put my bid in
Rip ride and try to keep it all hid in
Slide to the left and let yo' G homey get in
Gloccs of Velveeta, yep I'm off the meter
Ride by and see ya with my hands on a heater
Wanna be like the O but you act like a ho
Gotta lot of Patron, with a shot of the malt
Wanna be's wanna beef like nine-ninety nine
You wanna battle me? You better learn how to rhyme
Boys stop tweakin 'fore I light up the place
What he say? Who you talkin 'bout? I'm right in ya face
Aye! Aye! Baby girl you know we hit the coot a lot
Me and my nephews, yeah, we stayin true to life
They get the party live, Dogg is the motivator
Rockin the block socket and knockin down the player haters
Yeah nigga, you better know, it's incredible, unforgettable
Yeah, I bet I'm slow and I bet I'm low
We at the L.A. zoo, I'm wylin' out like an animal!
Niggas better get it right
Let me get a light, nigga let me get a light! (Get it right Dogg!)
Yeah, better get it right
Nigga let me get a light, homey let me get a light!
To get it tight they gotta get a light
Well, to get it tight they gotta get a light! (Get it right Dogg!)
To get it tight they gotta get a light
No, to get it tight they gotta get a light!

Lemme get a light nigga! (Snoop Dogg and Jr. Gong)
Lemme get a light man! Real talk man
It's yo' uncle, Snoop D O Double G
Bangin down yo' do' with my nephew Timbo! (Yeah!)
You know how we be! I.. indo, ooohhhwee, somethin' brand new.. y'know what I mean?
