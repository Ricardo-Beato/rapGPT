So I just came out the booth to God damn, to hear this, to hear this shit right here. And my niggas, nigga just, nigga just said, "bruh I just told them the same shit". That nigga say he just told these girls that, he knew what I was 'bout to say. That's crazy, cray-cray, I dig though, you know what I'm sayin'? With a golden shovel, with a iced out AP, plus a Rollie bezel on another level

I say bitch what is you thinkin', we Arthur Blankin’
Big checks on me and I got ranking, I'm steady ranking
Better stop listenin' to these hoes 'fore you start shrinkin'
I know I'm a blood, I'm a gang banger
I know ain't a bitch but I'm still singin'
Motherfuck the rest, they ain't really bangin'
I got the real hitters with me and they dangerous
You can't find 'em on no camera but they no namin'
Washing powder, bae, I'm tired, I've been up all night
Me and bae Bonnie Clyde, everything we do right
Love her vibe, love her vibe, she make me feel so nice
She 100, the first day we met, she let me fuck all night

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, work
Do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight, baby, do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight I wanna chill so you gotta do the work (Rihanna)
If you want it, you gotta earn it
You gotta earn it, you gotta earn-earn-earn-earn-earn-earn it
If you want it bae you gotta earn it
Alright, earn-earn-earn-earn-earn-earn it, ayy

I can tell that you want it baby, I can tell that you need it
I can tell that you suckin', fuckin', I can tell you a demon
I can tell you a Victoria, baby, I can keep your secret
I'ma show you how to win without cheatin', I'ma show you how to beat it
Drop top in a hotbox with a big tall demon
I'ma let you defeat me, I'ma lead you to victory
Like, shoutout to Stevie, but these niggas not seein' me
I'm a big dinosaur, B, and these niggas not bein' me
Ayy, I'm scared to trust you, I'm scared you'll trick me
I done drive by in a armored car but they're still trynna hit me
Put 60,000 on my mama ring and it ain't even come out of Tiffany's
I can tell you how to get the money but you just gotta listen to me

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, work
Do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight, baby, do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight I wanna chill so you gotta do the work (Rihanna)
If you want it, you gotta earn it
You gotta earn it, you gotta earn-earn-earn-earn-earn-earn it
If you want it bae you gotta earn it
Alright, earn-earn-earn-earn-earn-earn it, ayy

I picked my diamonds out a honey tree
I done made a couple millions off of BET
I got gangster bitch that ride and they gon' clap for me
I just signed a deal with Kevin, baby clap for me
Kevin without hundreds on me
Jeep truck when I pull up on 'em
Peep that with my little homies
I see all these little clonies (Who?)
I see you lookin' homie
Apple Watch with them boogers on it
Turn you down, upside, right baby girl like I'm cookin' on ya
I got 70,000 for my last 30 shows (Do the math)
I done spend a half a million for my family though
I think it's time to take my homies thes ride on a boat
Show them a good time cause I know they’ll do that for me, oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, work
Tonight baby, gotta work, work, work, work (Ayy)
Work, work, work, work (Ayy)
You gotta work, work, work, work, you gotta work (Ayy)
If you want it bae, you gotta earn it
You gotta earn-earn-earn-earn-earn-earn-earn it-ayy
If you wanna earn it
Yeah, you gotta earn-earn-earn-earn-earn-earn-earnit, ayy

Build a bridge, you better not burn it, ayy
Better be the number one concerned one, ayy
I got big dogs and they German, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy18Embed
