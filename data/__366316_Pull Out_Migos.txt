10 ContributorsPull Out Lyrics
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out

Everybody know I show out
VVS diamonds yeah they glow out
Droptop coupe bring the hoes out
Migo Gang in the building, club sold out
Big packs over here, nigga no drought
Got a 100 stashed at the traphouse
And a 100 stashed at the bando
I'm cooling in my lambo
Ain't gone lie, lil' mama look good
I'ma take her to the hood, Migo Gang run through her
I ain't gon' front you no weight lil' cuh
If you some money then maybe I'll do it
Counting up checks, I let her thumb through it
Ya'll just watch how Quavo do it
Go to Saks and spent a rack
Walked out the mall with nothing but Louis
You might also like
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out

Nigga try me, I'mma pull out
Fuck a foreign bitch, gotta pull out
Go to the club, I don't pull out
Foreign bitch, Jimmy Choo's, with her toes out
See 12, Ludacris, we roll out
Got bands on me, pull a pole out
Ice on my neck, so its cold out
I fuck with the hood, don't hold out
I'm a wild ass nigga like 
Light green in my swisher like Kermit
My pockets on fat like Sherman
I'm a preacher nigga, listen to the sermon
Got 50 bricks in the Excursion
In a Maybach, lookin' through the curtains
They say my pack Arabian, cocaine wrapped up like a turban
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out

Young nigga I see your chain, lemme take it off, pull out
Hollows went to deep in your body, now they hard to pull out
Got tired of pulling in the club, nigga I'm about to pull out
Got tired of fucking with your girl, nigga I'm about to pull out
We got a show at Echelon, 1 o'clock we gon' pull out
When we pull them benji's out, bad bitches tend to get pulled out
That Audi I don' pulled out, Masi I don' pulled out
Get Ben, went to the jeweler, gave him everything I pulled out
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Hunnid racks gone, when I pull out
Black Corvette, when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch, when I pull out
VVS, dripping when I pull out1Embed
