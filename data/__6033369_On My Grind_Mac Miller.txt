3 ContributorsOn My Grind Lyrics
This one's for the struggle
This one's for the hustlers

I like my Hennessy straight, baby, without no chaser
Got no time for love, 'cause I'm in love with the paper
So go 'head, leave, I'll be right here when you wake up
Still hustlin' every single bit of that 

'Cause I'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind)
Because i'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind)
Because I'm on my—

Yeah, I struggled a lot (Yeah), so I'm puffin' on pot
And inhalin' the smoke, and not carin' at all (See)
I got problems, but a bitch ain't one ('Cause)
If she's in love with mе, then the bitch ain't dumb (Ha)
'Cause I nеver had an ex that i ain't made cum
Just like I never had a slut that I kissed with tongue
See, there's rules to the G code, and every G knows
You treat a ride-or-die different than your ski ho (Yes)
So I got three hoes that give me deep throat
And then they leave 'til the next time I creep though (Wow)
I got a mean flow, and way too much ambition (Plus)
Marine's instinct, and hustler's intuition (Continue)
I got a fighter's heart (And?), and a killer's vision (What else?)
And a soldier's pride (And?), and a teacher's wisdom
And a legend's mind, and nothin' else is missin' (Except?)
Except for open ears, I like when people listen
You might also like
I like my Hennessy straight, baby, without no chaser
Got no time for love, 'cause I'm in love with the paper (Yo, Jimmie)
So go 'head, leave, I'll be right here when you wake up (You crazy, boy)
Still hustlin' every single bit of that 

'Cause I'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind) (I feel you, man)
Because i'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind) (The boy Mac Miller)
Because I'm on my—

Uh, I'm on my grind, and you never see me take a rest
So a hater's best bet is to save your breath (Cheah)
And when nothin' seem right, I'ma take a left
Workin', movin', makin', checks, grindin' for this paper fest (Yeah)
So  the time (Time, time, time)
I'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, uh-huh)
Never in recline (Recline), it starts to hurt my spine (Spine)
But I know it takes some workin' for the shine (Uh-huh)
Everyone in my whole damn camp eatin'
Know we stay feastin' with our own hands, feedin'
Y'all ain't even cheatin', get up on our level (Haha)
Yeah, we got drive like the pedal to the metal (Vroom)
And y'all just neutral (Neutral), cruise control (Cruise control)
Same damn speed, movin' super slow (Haha)
When I'm sleepin' in the studio, I'm goin' hard like the Steelers in the Super Bowl
I'm on my grind
I like my Hennessy straight, baby, without no chaser
Got no time for love, 'cause I'm in love with the paper
So go 'head, leave, I'll be right here when you wake up
Still hustlin' every single bit of that 

'Cause I'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind)
Because i'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind)
Because I'm on my—Embed
