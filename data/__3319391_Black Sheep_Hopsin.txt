28 ContributorsBlack Sheep Lyrics
And I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck
And I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up
Maybe I'm thinkin' too much, am I caught in my feelings?
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
It's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with
Oh, I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
Oh, I'm the black sheep

Fuck, a nigga just don't fit in
No one close to kin
I write about it so much I done broke my pen
And I'm so sick of pretendin' my life is so dandy and flawless
I'm stuck on a road to Hell
Fightin' demons but I let 'em drag me across it
While everybody happily applauds it
Tell me what caused it
Was it Monroe High? That's where I went to school at
All the black kids said I was white-washed
And the white kids said I was too black
When I skateboarded I got booed at
At lunchtime I was who they threw food at
I was tryin' so hard to cope with it
I really wanted to run up on campus with two gats
And just (ahh) let loose
Put some niggas in the E.R. for tryna treat me like a retard
Where the fuck does my future lie? I can't see far
Momma's little sweetheart, he developed an attitude
Picked up a mic, that's a Hell of an avenue
He gon' take yo' ass to Hell and then back with you
Life is a class you can tell I've been absent to
My massive doubt has got me wrapped around
And then it drags me down a bit
I don't know how to cast it out
I try to rap profound so you could laugh about the shit
Truth is, yo, I never laugh
I'm lookin' for wherever Heaven's at
The black sheep, they won't let him past
They would rather get together
Tie him up and then behead his ass, got me hella sad
Listen!

Do you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?
Like the world is never gon' need you?
I always do, every day is déjà vu for me

And I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck
And I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up
Maybe I'm thinkin' too much, am I caught in my feelings?
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
It's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with
Oh, I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
Oh, I'm the black sheep

That nigga whose brain is off, I am that
My train of thought left on Amtrak
I take the loss and I stand back
I can't pray to God for no hand clap
I can't recall when this damn crap
Became so overwhelmin' I started rebellin'
"I hate" is all as I stand as
Never got no love from my niggas
And no love from the hoes, pinned up in a hole
Tryna climb out the Devil's dark lab, but the oven is closed
I don't ever leave the house much
I never really thought this would be the outcome
Wish I had a window I was leapin' out from
My family is yellin', "Please, Jesus, help him!"
When I'm out in the real world, I feel like nobody knows me
What if this whole time I've had an issue and nobody told me?
See, this cold heart isn't cozy
Am I below par and I don't see?
I'm so disconnected from Earth
My hands are out so far but they won't reach
Should I get in a coffin?
Not many niggas would wanna kick it with me
Unless they were gonna benefit of it
Motherfuckers never interested in knowin' me
They just be just itchin' for Hopsin
I'd be frontin' if I act like it isn't a problem
I done shed tears contemplatin' my suicide in my room
Isn't it awesome? (Fuck no!)
Do you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?
Like the world is never gon' need you?
I always do, every day is déjà vu for me

And I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck
And I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up
Maybe I'm thinkin' too much, am I caught in my feelings
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
It's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
It's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
It's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
Oh, I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)13Embed
