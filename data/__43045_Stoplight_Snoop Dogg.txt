How else could you capture the world
If you don't attack from the back
To the million march... hehehehe
(Yo, Snoopa Donna - what?)

When I pull up to the stoplight
I gotta have the paper right (paper right)
And if you come back right then we can boogie, boogie, boogie
When I pull up to the stoplight
I gotta have the paper right (paper right)
And if you come back right then we can boogie, boogie, boogie

Boogie boogie boogie.. I'm goin 65, 75, 80
Mashin down the boulevard downtown movin like crazy
In the fast lane, High beams shinin
Tryna keep the timin on the track with the diamond in the back
Moon roof wide open, scopin, loc'in
The bitches believe, the hoes keep hopin
They can get it, fit in, back seat, just sit in
Fo' hoes on the block tryna put they bid in
Girl put it to work, you gon' do the damn thing
Hop in, the rest of y'all eat dirt
I'm rollin in the Mackmobile, I'm back for real
One hundred percent, pimp-motion, that's the deal
Back wheel spinnin, number one I'm winnin
Hoes lookin inside, and they just to grinnin
Waitin to choose, while the rest wait to pay y'all dues
Don't trip I keep my hoes in two

Yeah, this is radio station 187.4 FM on your dial
And you're caught up inside the five o'clock traffic jam
We gon' be taking requests right now at 87752-Snoop
Call the station namin' ya game...
Ah, yeah, hello, ah yeah, this Soopafly here
Man I wanna get a piece of that Stoplight shit
Man that motherfuckin bangin church

You see them pretty buttons on my stereo?
(Yea can I touch it?) Don't touch 'em ho!
You see Snoop Dogg on the floor mac
Pimpin ain't DEEEAD, now sit the fuck back
I'm the man in charge, +Boss+, my backhand is hard
Silky Slim, man I'm large
Mashin so big like a fo' by fo'
Show my do', and if not it's ho by go
Ain't a ho out there that can slow my flow
My wheels cost a fortune, bitch I'm scorchin
Seen some niggas who love to talk shit
Reach for my thang in my glove compartment
Didn't have to use it, blasted my music
Kids in the streets askin - Doggy how I dooze it?
First place in the race and don't wanna lose it
Niggas better watch out and bitches better mooooove it
Yeah baby, you gots ta move your groove
To prove that you supposed to groove in the move
As I recite naughty nothings in yo' eardrums
If you cruisin up the boulevard in your car
Put it in park and let the Dogg spark
Yeah baby!
 - repeat 2X

Ohhhhhhh noooooo, not the track of funk!
I am Sir Dunk, DPG Funk
And I hate Stoplight!
I always ran to the next like a Minnie
I told you I wouldn't C-Walk
Let me out, yarhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Half past late and I'm still rollin
Real ho'n, make a nigga pocket still swollen
Still goin, black and white tip-toe'n
Flashin my player's card (why you play so hard?)
Cause I'mma Don, sippin Moet, smokin chron'
Doggy wanna see that dress my loc's are on
Pimp from black-red, brunette back to blonde
Can't tell the sunset from the crack of dawn
Half tank of gas
Rollin' down the window, reach out and spank that ass
Gettin hot, turn down the heat, burn down the street
My hoes love to earn my keep
It's only five miles left, so I whipped it
Skipped it, flipped it in ovedrive
Straight bonafide pimp nigga on the rise
85, 95, 100 and good night and fuck that stoplight!
