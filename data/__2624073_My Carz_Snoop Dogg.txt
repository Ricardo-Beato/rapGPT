13 ContributorsMy Carz Lyrics
My cars, they hot, my paint is wet
My bitches, they bad, thats probably why y’all mad
My cars, they hot, my paint is wet
My bitches, they bad, thats probably why y’all mad
My cars, they hot, my paint is wet
My bitches, they bad, thats probably why y’all mad

You see I’m mean with the 16, yes you are
Got a big old house, bout 50 cars
And the ones I drive, what a hell of a ride
Built for a player when I lean to the side
My shit so dank, my paint is wet
‘Lacs, Impalas, and Corvettes
Wagoners, saggin’ here
Nigga not braggin’ here, but lets be clear
My cars, they hot, my paint is wet
So I figured the funk, point blank man this nigga a hoe
Look around, smash down, sit your ass down little class clown
Let me get back on the highway, try my way
This is the fly, way, Mass appeal, cash the deal
Never will I motherfuckin’ crash the wheel
Pass the feel, the tank with the drank in the cup
Look baby girl, thats whats up
Slide by my side bitch house in the cut
With my 9 by side when I side in the cut
I shake I shook in, peep out the window, niggas still lookin’
When in doubt, flash that 9 get in and out
Take my time while dippin’ out, then bang my set while spinnin’ out
You might also like
My cars, they hot, my paint is wet
My bitches, they bad, thats probably why y’all mad
My cars, they hot, my paint is wet
My bitches, they bad, thats probably why y’all mad
My cars, they hot, my paint is wet
My bitches, they bad, thats probably why y’all mad

Let me raise mine, bang for the Fo’
Pop that shit nigga break it down low
They say the stage with more lights
Can the nigga re-write the whole game
She tried to dodge the blue ride
Big race tires we ride the whole ride
We bringin’ it live to your side
You gonna stand outside or you gonna jump inside?
She said cool can my girls come?
We gon’ drank, smoke then fuck some
It was 2, 3, 4, then 5, tall short thick and fine
And they all enjoyed the ride, Dogg could you bring us all back again
I love it when you put it in my back again
Fill up in your car then you back again
Cause your cars are hot, your paint is wet
Your bitches, they’re bad, thats probably why they’re mad
Your cars, they’re hot, your paint is wet
Your bitches, they’re bad, thats probably why y’all mad
Your cars, they’re hot, your paint is wet
Your bitches, they’re bad, thats probably why y’all mad
Now look here mane
I got variation mane
I got a white one,  a black one, a yellow one
A green one, a blue one, a red one
I mean I mean mane, I even got a space ship, you dig
You could even float with me if you want to
Cause thats how a real player ride
We ride like we ride
You wanna get inside, well lets ride
You wanna get inside, well lets ride
You wanna get inside, well baby lets ride
You ever made love in a car? You don’t like when I talk to you like that?
You ever been fucked in a car? That sounds better don’t itEmbed
