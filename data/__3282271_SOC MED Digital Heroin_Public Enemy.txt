2 ContributorsSOC MED Digital Heroin Lyrics
Digital brain drain hits yo subclavian main vein
For the quick fix
Gotta get rich scheme
That got you insane
Memes hit the track, less than you check facts claim
Emojis that accentuate the lies in your mainframe
Let these bars reflect it, the self disrespected
These Twidiots with one-hundred forty characters disconnected
Complex urls and figures that can’t spell check it
Talk to text, non verbal skills auto correct this

I ain’t talkin’ crack babies lost in the 1980’s
Millennial grandkids who these gadgets made lazy
People caught up in the triangle of their lies
All comin’ out in the wash, will he survive?
Triangle Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr
Yeah, raised on music and the style that you hear
Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapback, uh yeah, get back
It’s high school all over again, so I clap back

Sick, twisted, narcissistic, hubristic
Interjecting your venom while playin’ evangelistic
Models and mystics livin’ unrealistic
Selfies and disconnection equating to mental sickness
Disjointed ramblings and musings you on some bitch shit
Unwanted mentions, opinions, why would you risk it?
You have no discipline so you cannot resist it
You ending up on that hit list cause karma, she never missed it

Damn! SOC MED
Shakin’ my damn head
Shakin’ my damn head
Damn dumb motherfucker on a smartass phone
Damn! SOC MED
Shakin’ my damn head
Shakin’ my damn head
Shakin’ my damn head

The pain of break ups
Hood fights and make ups
The check up from the neck up
But y’all won’t wake up
IPs that drive by
Reality shows a damn lie
This digital heroin is keepin’ you high
You need to fact check the fuckery
Cyber sex and sorcery
Chicks bustin’ it open with screwed up priorities
That shits disorderly hmm you just ignorin’ me
See cause y’all done pledged to this shit like a sorority

Idle chatter and lipstick
Materialistic and postings
For you wanna be rich cliques
With value in the wrong shit
A drop squad at your door
For all you demons in the gossip for likes clique
You powerless, no independent thought so you drifted
Hypnotic rhythm, strangers opinions got you addicted
These habits of ignorance breeds cognitive dissonance
Social media digital heroin and remember it
Damn! SOC MED
Shakin’ my damn head
Shakin’ my damn head
Damn dumb motherfucker on a smartass phone
Damn! SOC MED
Shakin’ my damn head
Shakin’ my damn head
Shakin’ my damn head

Tumblin’ down to sleep
Take it to the bed
Strategically hip
Connected to the head
Easy check off
Check in with the feds
Lost in the avatar
Lookin’ for street cred
Followin’ hollow heads and the trends they tread
Sympathetic to the synthetic
Shakin’ my damn head
Lost in the SOC MED
Report to the feds
Till that phone be dead
And the needle in the red
139 characters plus 1 I said
Shakin’ my damn head
And what the internet said
Damn! SOC MED
Shakin’ my damn head
Shakin’ my damn head
Damn!

There have been terrorist attacks that no one knows aboutEmbed
