24 ContributorsY’all Been Warned Lyrics
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, hey
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up, one
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up
That's what's up
Eh, eh, eh
That's what's up
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up

Wu-Tang nigga, crash your crew, laugh at you
You bastard, you, pass through, slap an ass or two
Hear me roar, Timbaland tree, weed galore
MC's with gusto, y'all ain't never seen before
El-Producto, pass that, you puff too slow
That's what's up, yo, the kid with the buck-toothed flow
Oh, that's Meth' Man, southpaw, I throw my left hand
To that hardcore shit that even make the TEC jam
Oh, my goodness, trust me, ain't nothing like some hood shit
Gotta love my dogs, but ain't nothing like a good bitch
Strictly, if I'm goin' down, she comin' with me
Whole time screamin', "Oh, my God!", ain't no mystery

(Y'all been warned) About them Killa Bees on the swarm
(Y'all been warned) You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong, but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake-ass gone
(Y'all been warned) About them Killa Bees on the swarm
(Y'all been warned) You either step or get stepped upon, nigga
Uh-oh, I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin', "It's on!"
You might also like
Try to Wu hate, duck, you could suck my…
Watch the block get clear when I buck my…
Boomerang darts, you can't duck my…
No tellin' which Clan, man, you got struck by
Chains get tucked when he walk by; hawk eye
Arrows bein' fired from crossbow, I talk fly
You can't Etch-A-Sketch, all my rhyme threat
Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat strep
Soaked in sex, dope, you eat the cold TEC's
Boldflex, W crown, the ice O-X
Up in the oolie, yo, who you know?
John Bizzi, Ghost Deini, Rollie Finger and them toolies, yo
Stainless Bobby, boy, you have an English folly
To try to detain the slang that we came to party
Plus you didn't peep Irief, kid, you sleep
I seen this heap of shit, you in steep

(Y'all been warned) About them Killa Bees on the swarm
(Y'all been warned) You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong, but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake-ass gone

Yo, amidst the gravel, play the words of the Big Apple
Broadcastin' live from the pits of the battle
Wigs split and rattled, get shook out ya saddle
You ever hear me losin,' one of y'all fix the panel
Ask who? Wu, that's true, known piranhas
Who knows drama? Fathers of your whole persona
The mad doctor stay locked in the O.R. 
In too deep, beyond reach of the sonar
Still a vet, say my name next to hall of fame
Hurtin' third string players, first day in the game
It's on, son, the Killa Bee swarm come
Make the world shake with one continuous drum
(Y'all been warned) About them Killa Bees on the swarm
(Y'all been warned) You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong, but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake-ass gone

Wave ya gun, Killa (I got you)
Shoot this nigga in his face for his mumblin' (I heard y'all forgot Wu)
Wear ya crown, black down (Watch the block, too)
Blow at y'all niggas (Blowin' at the cops, too)
Yo, my wallets stay bulletproof, racin' in coups
Yeah, we the realest, ultraviolet leathers on, pealin' this
Love lookin' the illest, gorilla things
Monster background with a history of pumpin' crack
Yap clowns, we all real in here; strap a bomb
On a family member, let y'all niggas know we here
Blasted, it's like cheeba when I splashed it
Real reefer heads'll know the meanin' of hittin' glass
I told y'alls, against y'all, Ginsus avenge gods
Picture me stabbin' you in the yard for R's
Kid saw Staten, nine *Bin Ladens*
Valours on, colourful drawers, lookin' all relaxed in

(Y'all been warned) About them Killa Bees on the swarm
(Y'all been warned) You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong, but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake-ass gone
(Y'all been warned) About them Killa Bees on the swarm
(Y'all been warned) You either step or get stepped upon, nigga
Uh-oh, I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin', "It's on!"
"I not begging for my own life
Just let my child be born, then I don't mind dying"
"Ha, that's great kill her and his child
Ta Chi, go ahead"Embed
