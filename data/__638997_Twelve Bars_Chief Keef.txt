10 ContributorsTwelve Bars Lyrics
Twelve million
It's just me and twelve chillin'
Think I got 'bout twelve children
Think I got 'bout twelve million
I think I got 'bout twelve cars
Bitches like 'cause I'm a star
I can buy 'bout twelve bars
Front twenty bands and get twelve bars

I'm off twelve bars
Drivin' twelve cars, goin' fast
I met twelve stars
That was twelve blunts, gettin' high

Twelve million
It's just me and twelve chillin'
Think I got 'bout twelve children
Think I got 'bout twelve million
I think I got 'bout twelve cars
Bitches like 'cause I'm a star
I can buy 'bout twelve bars
Front twenty bands and get twelve bars
You might also like
For them pounds, bitch, I need twelve large
I just picked up 'bout twelve thots
Need to go and buy, buy 'bout twelve cars
This shit ain't easy, it ain't that damn hard
Almighty So, go so damn hard
Gotta do it cause my fam' large
Once you walk in the club, buy twelve bottles
Nigga try me, he get twelve hollow

Twelve million
It's just me and twelve chillin'
Think I got 'bout twelve children
Think I got 'bout twelve million
I think I got 'bout twelve cars
Bitches like 'cause I'm a star
I can buy 'bout twelve bars
Front twenty bands and get twelve bars1Embed
