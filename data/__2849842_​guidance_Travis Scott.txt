And I found out that you're bad for me
I found out that you had someone
Every time I get this drunk
I hope I wake up in another place (I roll up, I roll up)

I roll up behind it (Yeah), I wanna try it (Yeah)
Grip on your waist, bust up the place, tantalizin' (Straight up)
You're from the Islands, you stay wildin'
I guide, I guide you like a pilot

Haven't been around this year (Yeah, yeah)
I like to see you change your gears (It's lit)
To a motion that's more faster, babe
