85 ContributorsQuarterback Lyrics
Ninth grade
Listen, nigga
Yeah
Gah

Ninth grade, quarterback, Washington High (Ninth grade)
When you in the trap, all these rules apply (Listen, nigga)
Keep it in your lap, not to the side (Yeah)
End up successful, all your cars glide (Woo)
Breathe easy (Yeah), bitch I might just teach you (Might just teach you)
Not a pleaser (No), I might Mickey D's her (Shit, shit)
Hey, top rope, I might John Cena (What?)
Dot in a nigga head, no meal (What's brackin'?)

Momma duck eating good like she 'posed to (Wah)
Spent a dub on my teeth and my golds too (Rack)
Spent a sixty on the bracelet but it old news (Ice)
Spent a dime on the red carpet, ooh-ooh (Ice)
So many black chains on, look like a goatee (Woo)
I re-up every week (Woo)
Your bitch gon' suck me, look like she don't got no teeth (Suck it, suck it)
She even suck it better than the time she on her knees (Ah, ah)
Bring a Molly, yeah, I'll see, hey (Brah)
I'm smoking pot while you smoke weed, ayy, wait, hey (Stoner)
Just 'cause I'm signed, don't mean treat me (What's brackin'?)

Shout out Skippa Da Flippa, came up from nickles (Flippa)
Green diamonds like a dill pickle (Shine)
Everybody know that I'm in the field (Woo)
Drinking and pouring up double seal (Lean)
Remember the days when I was road runnin' (Woo)
Taking trips across the country just for money (Ooh)

The world's gonna end one day, read it in Revelations (God)
Good brain, she deserve a scholarship (Good brainer)
The pistol like lighters, you know that I pocket it (Rrah)

I got on my Cartier eating on caviar (Cartier)
Actavis sippin', lickin' on her nipple (Ooh)
Double down F&N shooting out missiles (Pew, pew)
Cowards get attention like a nigga when he whistle (Pff)
Them niggas caught you slipping 'cause you didn't have a pistol (Bah)
OG gas bag and I flip it like a nickle (Gas bag)

Make them move it like John Cena (Move it)
Catch a nigga bitch while I'm eating (Woah, gimme that, woah)
Diamonds on my neck, blinging (Blinging, brr, bling)
In the Phantom of the opera leaning (Lean, lean)
Two double cup got me fiendin' (Lean, lean)
I dream of genie bitches in bikinis (Bikinis, bitch)
They dreaming for the fettuccine (Cash)
Pull up and drop my top off like Houdini (Skrt, woah)
Giuseppes on my feet, safari zebras (Safari)
Motor fitted, dabbing in the Lee (Dab, dab, dab, dab)
Sit you ass down like I'm Beanie Sigel (Sit you ass, get it, get it)
What's crackin'? Crippin' nigga, twisting fingers (Throw it up)
Longway and Thugger Jonesboro South demeanor (Thugger)
I step in the club with the .40 and Nina (Gotta keep cover)
Look at his head call it buzzle bee (Boom, boom, boom, boom, grr)
Smoking OG Moon Rocks mixed with the Diesel (Good gas)
Givenchy walking on the stars (Givenchy, ah)
Lil' bitty bitches, just eat it up (She eat)
Jump on the dick, she gon' skin it up (So?)
Pull up in a fuckin' Bentley truck (Woah, woah)
Longway, bitch (Hey!)13Embed
