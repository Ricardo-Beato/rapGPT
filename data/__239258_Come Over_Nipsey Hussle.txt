11 ContributorsCome Over Lyrics
Shout to my Crenshaw girls
You know, the real ones
You know, like the ones that went to Crenshaw High School
Yeah you
Nipsey said this for y'all
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, oh
Girl, listen

Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
You know that I'm down
Tell me if you wanna stay
Start on this elevator, no one's around
Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
Girl, I'll wait, you could come over later, whenever
Girl, or you could come right now, now

Just, waiting on you, know you're running late, baby
You're working so hard, you deserve a break
And girl, I'll break you off, whenever you're ready
Girl, you can take my Mercedes

Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
You know that I'm down
Tell me if you wanna stay
Start on this elevator, no one's around
Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
Girl, I'll wait, you could come over later, whenever
Girl, or you could come right now, now

Yeah, you can go out, for real I need some sleep, baby
You can show out, I ain't trippin' let 'em see
'Cause when you get home whenever you're ready
I'll show you I appreciate it, when you get home

Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
You know that I'm down
Tell me if you wanna stay
Start on this elevator, no one's around
Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
Girl, I'll wait, you could come over later, whenever
Girl, or you could come right now, now

Look, yeah, yeah, you know I'm the shit
You know I'm the reason you know real niggas exist
If I don't do nothing, you know I'm gon' do it big
You gon' do it big, um, 'cause I'm your nig
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm the legit
You know I'm the reason you rock Rolies on your wrist
I know it's a gamble, don't be scared to take that risk
You fucking with a star so don't be scared to make that wish
Yeah, yeah, and I know that you that bitch
I know that at times you feel like niggas wasn't shit
And I'm not sayin' I can take your broken heart and fix
But I'm just sayin' we should take a trip
Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
You know that I'm down
Tell me if you wanna stay
Start on this elevator, no one's around
Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
Girl, I'll wait, you could come over later, whenever
Girl, or you could come right now, now
Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
You know that I'm down
Tell me if you wanna stay
Start on this elevator, no one's around
Girl, if you wanna go play, you could come over later
Girl, I'll wait, you could come over later, whenever
Girl, or you could come right now, now7Embed
