I told you I would show up
Screaming out "FNF!" 'til the world blow up
They said I was so finished, I told 'em it's show business
Meanin' there's no business 'less Fiasco's in it
Disrespect the dress code; wear my street clothes in it
Measured, sold, and clothed in it
Opened up, closed after I entered and drove in it, like uhh

Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep

Roll in it, music bumpin, windows tinted
Through the good neighbourhoods and all of the woes in it
Exerted control in it
Seen it come and go, stolen and sold in it
Diamond and gold plated
Fountain of youth, dippin my toes in it
Bounce in the booth, spit it like Skoal in it
Putting my heart and my soul in it

Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'

With fifteen in the clip and one in the hole
Hallway wall full of R.I.P.'s, some some of us know
None of us know the makers of the toast
Like the bottom of the stove that was used in the murderin' of the scroll
Heart colder than Edy's
Won't let the seedy city defeat me
Rub me out like genies, won't concede til I'm graffiti
Nigga what

Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep
I done bellowed, said "What up?" to the reaper
Hell met like Riddell, then high-water, hello
To the five-year-old gunshot hearer, I hear ya
Clearer than the invisible man in the mirror
Cheer up, I put it on the bars like beer nuts
Put a bug in they ear, so from here up, they hear us

Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep

Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'

I put it on my grandmomma's daughter
I microphone control with the soul of slave hummin "Wadin in the Water"
I author like D.W. brother, like a hustla'
God place me in ya armor, I prescribe no partners
I do it for the hood like a parka
But tell my niggas not to shiver
Only time we quiver like a archer is
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep

Here we are now, entertain us
Change don't change us
Ever since the game trained us
We came up like worms in the rain
I dream my chain became a loose noose that was used to hang us
So now, my insane brain, my 32 teeth
And two feet creep like its Elm Street

Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart

Opus of a ghetto boy who grew into a project man
Brewster Place, he used to stick his scissors in his sockets—damn
Clear that project runway, 'cause this is where my rocket lands
Ain’t got no problems, Houston—I A.K.A. then rocket-land
Events recent that lit a fire under him like pots and pans
Rockets and I up in the sky, like helicopter cams
And you down there in the traffic jam
From here, I’ve seen a bunch of fake shit like avid wrassling fans
Came up from the bottom of the eye exam—zoom!
Now, I’m like the biggest G up in the room
Still hard to see me like the truth on TV
Or the roof from the sidewalk; I don’t flow, I ceiling
My mama said they need me
'Cause I’m made from the best stuff on earth, like Snapple Tea Leaves
They glass is half full, so I spit into them like Celie
No longer G—now, you can see me
But your letter's still under my sea, like seaweed
C and G but nothing 'bout me C-G
It’s all real—none of this is green screen
"Shut Up and Let Me Go" just like The Ting Tings
I’m feeling like a Mac standing around a bunch of PCs
I’ve rocked it from the shottas to the soccer moms
Try to stop what’s going on
You’ll see the back of my hand like the tops of palms
I’m balling like the tops of Palms
Circle of influence getting bigger like the ripples on the tops of ponds
Sure-footed and war-headed like the tops of bombs
Dominoing niggas; delivery is Papa John's
Little Caesar's of burning down your Pizza Huts
Plaque collection building 'cause I don’t brush my teeth enough, yeah
Yeah, crack is wack and reefer sucks
You might think this deep as fuck, but this is like my weaker stuff
They ask, "Is this his day-to-day? 'cause this is like a week to us"
Mic is shy and speakers blush
I is shy and he is up; I correct—me is up
No we is up, 'cause it's like two of me
And each of us rapping acid—eat this up
A-Town down, peace is up
New York to East Coast is cuffed; westside riding
Lot of niggas' salty 'cause, 'cause I be overseas and tough
Everything seamless, WorldStar never seen this
NahRight gotta stream this, motherfucking genius
Brave and fly; you backbone-less and wingless
Bunch of chickens on the strip—I’m coming for they fingers
'Til what they throwing up is meaningless
Chilly Chill, you seeing this? This didn’t make MTV’s list
Finish fingers, eating wrist, feeding frenzy and shit
Succotash-suffering, chicken fricasseeing this
A beat-eating media blitz, pace is getting feverish
Pain is growing Seaver-ish, these the peppers Peter picked
Things are at their easiest, real Compton-city-G’ing it

Let me put you on game

Don't you know that I run this place?
And I've begun this race, must I rerun this pace?
I'm the reason it's become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised

As they love my darkness, I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist
(Let me put you on game)
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this, but they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow, I am the one that they march with

Through the back alleys and the black markets
The Oval offices, crack houses, and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings
(Let me put you on game)
Through the veinses of the fiends
A paper chaser's pager, yo, I'm famous on the scene
One of the oldest, most ancientest things
Speak every single language on the planet, ya'n mean?
(Let me put you on game)
I am the American dream
The rape of Africa, the undying machine
The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
The tough guy's front and the one behind the scenes
(Let me put you on game)
I am the blood of this city, its gas, water, and electricity
I'm its gym, and its math, and its history
The gunshots in the class
And you can't pass if you missin', G
I taught them better than that
I taught them aim for the head and hope they never come back
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby, hope he never comes back
I hope he's with your mother with my hustlers high in my traps
(Let me put you on game)
I hope you die in his trash
I can't help it, all I hear when you crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had
(Let me put you on game)
Then maybe you can grow up and be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs
(Let me put you on game)
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel, so I make them cool
(Let me put you on game)
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed them from the table that held Corleone's food
If you die, tell them that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name

"The Cool"
Turn me up, uh-huh, yeah

He came back in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh-to-death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it 'cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat, like, two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory; he didn't mind it, but—
He couldn't sip it fast enough
So, the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second-grade handwriting simply read, "I miss ya"
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open
And he...

Paying your dues (Uh-huh), chasing the cool

Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it
Working like a... hmm... reverse archaeologist
Except his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled hisself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box; wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So, with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home
So he...

He begged for some change to get him on the train
"Damn, that nigga stank" is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt, but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look; wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter-fact, only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and gettin' back in his lane
Doin' his thing—first, he had to find somethin' to sling
Next stop was his block; it had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked that some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there, so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said, "You're scared, ain't you?"
He said, "Hustler for death, no heaven for a gangster"
And...
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie (Ugh)

Tonight, tonight, tonight
The stars are aligned, and the planets colliding
The plan is arriving, and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
The parents are goners, no children to mourn us
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
We've lost all our babies, and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of the rhymer
The pimp and the riser
Your cross, there you'll find her
Hey, hey

Death is on the tip of her tongue and

Disease, the virus is spreading in all directions
No safe zone no cure and no protection
No symptoms define the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies, and no corrections
Quarantine the dreams and seal off the connections
Don't let them in, not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and want you to have it next and
Don't accept them if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness, some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war
Invented by the press, just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
Whores say the nuns, nuns say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientist say it only affects the mind
The little boy said it only affects the girls

"Believe!", so say the neon signs by the
Loudspeakers repeating that everything is fine;
A subtle solace to demolish the troubled conscience
Of a populace with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted
From the masters to the masses
From the antennas on the top of the shrines
Refine the receiver and plant it
During the panic and short it, it reports back
Everything in your mind, everything is lying
Everything is dying, everything is a rule
Everything is a crime, everything was here then
Everything rewind the new
Weather burned the feathers off everything flying
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit
The lavish, the fastest, the clashes, the ashes to ashes
Everything intertwined
My femme fatale my darling fraudulent angel
Once caught her changing the batteries in her halo
Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
Scientist said she's all inside my mind
The little boy said "What happened to all the girls?"
The preacher man said "She's going to kill off your soul."
The dope boy said "It's the whole wide world."

One time, for your mind
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Wherever I go she go

I love her, and I hate to leave her lonely
Ring-ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, "Let's hit Japan, if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France"
Nothing further; I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
"You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows"
I turn to see my dream, love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
Than 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher

Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

So let's keep it real, all in together, "Free Chill"
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Don't wake me 'til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honoré, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and
Everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, umm
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

Guess who's back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To la-la land to count them sheep
I swear you're looking prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to you
But Ian said, "Aloha", and Harley said, "Cheers"
Julian said, "Bonjour", Big O was like, "Yeah!"
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, "Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart, and on your mind"

There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest, I'm sitting in my room

Now if we Auto-Tune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera groomed fat bitch
Telling us not to pursue it, just to shoe it like a blacksmith
We’re trapped, and moving round in circles like it’s Chapstick
And that’s the same encircled way of thinking that we chat with
We’ll wrap this around your head
Like the bandanas Fabolous used to wrap his hats with
Rather be in FEDS instead of National Geographics
Well, I’m not having it, nawwww
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you
So, I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain’t never heard mine
And if you have, then you know you ain’t never heard lying
Lu don’t moo, no, cow-ards, you only heard lines
Not a facade cherisher, I’d rather have the scars
I don’t idolize America, I’m dancing with the stars
Uh-huh, all of them? Yeah, they are, too
You look up and you see us shining down on you
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

Shining down on you
Shining down on you
Shining down on you5Embed
Uh! I bring you murder in the first
And even as we speak we getting further in this verse
With no further ado I do what I respect
Doom got me stripes like Hamburgler for my work
As Lupe the killa, killa, killa, killa
Mercy, he's a mess, so immersed in his murk
He's 2/3 submerged below the surface where they surf
This is where I lay it down like a bird giving birth
So call me "Lu the Giant's Goose" or just "Faberge paint"
Til I'm called back to the shore by the watchers of the bay
I wait, til I come back like a tsunami
Never microwave like the watchers of the weight
I'm wrapped in aluminum foil, I do my dirt like Kwame
Until that same soil being pushed into my grave
But I'm so ahead of my time, the next day
Might strike oil where I been layed, homie I'm so crude
Texas tea, haters is so screwed
But I can't fill it like a flathead in a Philips
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm no tool
More cool than a pool in a blizzard
With ice cubes in it during Christmas
Meanin' there's no schoolin' the misfit
Like I'm throwin' a fit
Or I just can't fit it, tidbit too big
It's gotta hem it til it's fresh to death
Dressed to kill it, like uh!
You might also like
Uh, 187 on my second, I reckon
This is an assault with a deadly session
A soft peace and blessings to the sentence that be reppin
All across in every direction, locality, and section
That know Lupe the killa, killa, killa, killa
Give it how I live it most niggas won't believe
Or achieve how I did it most niggas won't receive
'Til I leave and I bereave the secrets of my sickness
How I, flooded the streets like Venice
I've suffered, demanded, withstanded, pimp handed and hustlin'
I'm Colonel Mustard with the speech
They ain't catchin' me, no suspicions of stickin'
No convictions on my rap sheet
I'm so committing lay my murder game,that's sweet
Speakeasy like Prohibition, no admission
If you ain't knocking like me to the underground bar, burying a toast
Dodging the raid like roach, nigga please

Uh, I make it give up the ghost
On the trifecta, the third, I differ
Nigga, you ain't heard, my lecture like Lecter
Letchya in on a secret, but you can't leak it
Lupe's the killa, killa, killa, killa
Since my entrance, my niggas had packs
They moved em to a trap like Winston
Far from bustas, baby nah
All my homies henchmen
I was the rhymer, my talk went through the walls like Slimer
Or like, eating vagina
Or, a stray bullet, whichever ways I put it
Crooks was hooked like crooks through neighborhoods I pushed it
Little Caesar niggas pizzas was like "book it"
Delivery mean like Leroy Green
They couldn't take it to the places I took it
Beware, you don't look it
You ain't dressed for this affair
I'm hooded in the bushes like uh4Embed

Thank you
Feels good waking up! Get back...
On my J-O...

Plus, I gotta go to work
It's cool!

I wipe the cool from my eye
Stationed in Antarctica; coldest nigga alive
Flow is Armageddon, might smite crows from the sky
Before you drive you have to wipe locusts off your rides
But I'm warming up, oceans is on the rise
I be Ocean with 11 associates on my side
Colder than Chris Martin guitaring
Would you look at all these spies
But they can’t see me, I took out their eyes
Replace with some he’s, so all they see is eh’s
But I will never run, not even if they cry
See I can never fall, not even down their cheek
But I will always bawl, let’s see who the first to blink
And I don't need no passwords cause I don't need to cheat
But you can say your last words, and you can rest in peace
I’m the hook after your last verse I’m also like the beat

Insomniac since way back, see this is what I been like
Baking eggs and pancakes, eating that at midnight
Getting up and going hard, I don’t need no Enzyte
Come across as very calm: mental state is Zen-like
Always had a lot of heart, never been the tin type
Never will I drop a dime, never been the 10 type
My girlfriend is very fine, yes she is a ten right
Mink is draggin’ on the flo', fire in my windpipe
You should come and clean up after the riots that I incite
Things get off the handle, left behind a landfill
Traffic at a standstill, stadium is fan-filled
Fill this bitch up with fans you still won’t blow my candle out
My "can do" spirit's in the house
And is possessing your possessions, did you hear it by the couch?
Boogieman under your bed, not in your closet
Cause I'm not a homo, won't drill no door hole
I won’t make a peep, so you can go to sleep
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep

I wipe the cold from my eye
Then put it in my stove and hope that my dough rise
And then my clothes dry, but I am so high
I am sitting on the storm that I got soaked by
Now you can come closer, you can get warm but you get no pie
But you can sell it for em so here’s you bow tie
Now get ready to fall cause humans don’t fly
The boy in the balloon - see? I didn’t go hide
And I'm coming back to float again
Close down all the opium but I had to O-P-EN
They said they need a hero in it so I'm back to dope again
Pull up in that old-school Flintstone drop on rolling pins
Time is all behind me, this make me feel old again
Grandma's all around me, I can feel her soul within
Hope my daddy over him; woke the roosters, woke the hens
Everything's cashmere, count the sheep that you…
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in

I hope it never ends, I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend that it's
Better than it's ever been
Lie to ourselves

Said everything's gonna be o-o-okay, just don't breathe the air

He just sits, and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero, they don't love him no more
There's a blast, every time a ten hit's the floor
His gift, for not fighting another man's war
And if they can get their hands on the mask
That he had wore on his face
They can put somebody else in his place, to restore
The state, the illusion that it's safe
The faith, that being a slave is so great
As gas fills the room
And rockets destroy everything around him
He stands to find himself surrounded
By thousands of soldiers that he once trained
To never miss their targets, heartless
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness
Pleased to make your acquaintance, salutations

Heavy-weighter, slim as the Machinist, so bulimic
Which means you somewhere in between it
I take it back for you like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas
I'm in the market for low-mile 360 Modena annd a good organic cleaners
My car always a winner
Your car's always pitted—we should call it" Stanley Steamers"

I ride with the meanest
I'm armed to the teeth
You're Venus, and you've never been to the dentist
School of Hard Knocks, I dean it
I done it, as well as a celebrated alumnus
I donate to the campus, and my name's on the arenas
But you can't bring it to my court—not even with subpoenas
'Cause you can't play my sport, but you can still cheerlead us
And you can't sit there—that section's for the seniors
And the sexy señoritas, so, just move up to the bleachers
How you gonna school me when I grew up with your teachers?
I know that you can't hear me 'cause I blew up all the speakers
And the power line is hanging 'cause I threw up all the sneakers
I ate up the imposters and I chewed through all the pizzas
I blacked out with a black card and I maxed out all the Visas, ugh
Accreditation so prestigious
Just walk across my stage—your life will be completed
Don't need financial aid, 'cause this is just some free shit
You been properly prepared, throw your hats up in the air
I'm red hot, Chilly—I'm Anthony Kiedis

I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
And what's written on her titties is what it's really about

Ass is a daughter without a dad
Back is like Afghanistan, Iraq

Food and Liquor flow
Strong like it's been distilled by hillbillies in the hills
And we moved down to Beverly
So heavenly, waking niggas up like "Reveille"
We won't be going back to you regularly, so, forget it
Shadow flow, colder than Punxsutawney Phillip's
My mind's on dope; my brain's on skillets
Thoroughly trained to just bang off lyrics
"Bang, bang, bang," like Pops Wayans—
Witherspoon or with a fork
Was coming out my egg like Mork
Deserves his own head on Rushmore
Flood the game like a giant in a dwarf shorts
So long, niggas
Career so short, it should be riding on a horse
Mines is a horse
But mines is the size you could sneak inside a fort
Yours is a pony—it could sleep inside a Porsche
I am on point like the eating side of forks
So keep your head down like your reflection in a spoon
Chilly Chill'll be out of Corrections real soon

First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said "It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here"

My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said "I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two"
She said "Bow! I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds" (Woo!)
"Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here"
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said "I don't normally take dates in here"
Security came and said "I'm sorry, there's no skating here"
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push

Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head... to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come roll with me

Flagrantly fragrant and they can't escape it
My perfume pursued them everywhere that they went
You don't want a loan, leave my cologne alone
It's a little too strong for you to be putting on
Trust me, I say this justly
I went from musty to musky and y'all can't mush me
I warn y'all cornballs, I hush puppies
The swans in the pond call my duck ugly

The belly of the beast, you know I'm from it
I wrap it in a towel, hit Gomer Pyle in the stomach
And I be on my green like Irish Spring and I coast
Fudge with it, get a mouth full of soap
You want the flava ma? Hey, I gotcha
You want the realness? Well, I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters
You want the real shit? Well, I gotcha
You see my niggas here, you know we proper
You know we do it right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right) right (Right) right (You know we do it)

And so to sign off, this beat I rhyme off
Is from Thelonious P and Hugo Mind Boss
You feel it in the air, it's such a fine force
But you don't hear me though, just like a mime's talk
That's cause I'm in Europe, me in my French tour
I'm on my pimp, my temperature is tempura
I take it easy on my watch, I'm watching TV
In my cleanest Maharashi, see the hare is tryna beat me
I continue to do Lu's pace
They say him got two heads and four eyes just like screwface
But see my secret's safe, it's in my secret safe
That's in my secret room on my secret base
So from the runner of the FNF crew
Come in hip hop, we've come to resurrect you
You, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you
You want the flava ma? Hey, I gotcha
You want the realness? Well, I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters

Well, the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin', no
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus, he had to be at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read: "A lil hungry, and need a lil money
It's for my lil sister and her lil tummy"
Wasn't lyin', though—he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
Cause he knew they wasn't cookin' where he live
The "kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk"s now took him to the crib
A lil' hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right past the pushers who couldn't under-dig
"What's the use of pushin', you ain't pushin' none of this?"
"If I kick it with y'all, I'm just pushin' for a bid"

You see, his mom was a crackhead
And his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combatted
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see, his girl was a white girl
But just 'cause she was white, see, her life wasn't light-world
She, too, had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama, but her daddy used to mama-hit
Daddy caught something chasin' fatties, made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
Had suicidal feelings
But riding switch over the transitions help her conquer it
Pays for her mama's pills with a sponsorship
Her cell phone bill and a Honda kit, uh-huh
And that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel her pain and a place to be

That's why, that's why, that's why, she kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothing back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah

Add in the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair who just liked to watch
And that was the whole clique
I think about 'em every time I see this old flick
That was taken in the park in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, "You thank for 'Push, Kick'
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick"
Well, I did—I hope you seen it
It's on MTV, Soundtrakk's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk, beef from the Ice Creamaz

Then they took a pull of killer to the brain like (inhale noise) ah

Declaring war on the deck like they The Joker

While they polka with the devil in our moonlitten ghetto

You live, forever

How 'bout them bullets ain't slow you up?
You ain't really died and we watched you grow up
At 12 months you took your first steps
Awkwardly across the kitchen floor to your best
Your first breaths that we can call words
Were in your father's lap on November 23rd
And they were, "Live for me", and he did for you
Flipped to Neutron and stayed inside the crib for you
And this commitment from your father
Imparted a deep sense of value you forever harbor
We were all so proud as we seen you getting smarter
And the bond grow deeper between a mother and a daughter
'Cause you were not a martyr
(You live)

Find out, I was just a bad dream
Goodbye

At six, you started reading whole books
At seven, you knew how a brain looked
And could roughly describe, all the different regions
Could tell when we was sick and even knew the reason
The world wasn't at peace, gunfire every weekend
But you were hardly there, cause you was always leaving
Field museum, planetarium, aquarium
You saw something special in that tank you were starin' in
And in those moments, as a little girl
You realized there was a bigger world
Bigger than the South Side, bigger than Chicago
You were bigger, still wanted rims on your car though
And big ass woofers in your car door
So you could wang like your daddy at the park eating sharks
Went to King where you were teased for being smart
Where you bumped into Hadiya teaching art
You live forever

At sixteen is when you got your scholarship
At twenty-two is when you got your doctorate
Even now it's kind of hard to believe
But your father taught you work hard, and achieve
And you complied
Accepted by every medical school you applied
But the coolest thing is when they offered you that high paying slot, you replied
"They need me in the hood," and that's where you reside
Free clinic, nobody denied
And that's where you heard the shots and quickly ran outside
And saw a man and a van and a bleeding baby in his hands
Fading fast, but you knew she could survive
Did everything you could to keep this girl alive
Stabilized until the ambulance arrived
And in that moment, where you gave your help
I bet you didn't know that you saved yourself

Fold down your hands, give me a sign
Hooked on your lies
You live, forever
Lay down next to me, don't listen when I scream
Bury your doubts and fall asleep

And I got no place to go
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it hurts me soul

I had to ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking, "Golly, God, guard me from the ungodly"
But by my thirtieth watching of Streets is Watching
I was back to giving props again, and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as a Untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustled to seemed wrong
But these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool (Cool)
I found a condom on the ground that johns would cum into
And thought: "What constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit
Then, they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said, "Don't knock it, mind your business"
His business isn't mindin' that nigga pimpin'—got it
They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, their cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got no place to go
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang-time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me
Turn off my TV (Ugh, yeah) 'cause it hurts me soul
So, through the Grim Reaper sickle-sharpening
Macintosh marketing, oil field auguring
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation, Islamic martyrdom (Woo)
Precise, yeah, laser-guided targeting
Oil-for-food bartering, terrorist organization harboring
Sand-camouflaged army men
CCF sponsoring, world conquering, telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling, pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering, bulimic vomiting
Catholic Priest fondling, preemptive bombing
And Osama and Obama 'nem
They breaking in my car again
Deforestation and overlogging, and
Hennessy and Hypnotiq swallowing
Hydroponic coughing, and... (Woo!) all the world's ills
Sitting on chrome, twenty-four-inch wheels, like that
They say I'm infected, this is why I inject it
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here
But I got no place to go
I can't stop eating, my best friend's leaving
My pastor touched me, I love this country
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me
'Cause it hurts me soul

Yeah, whoa-oh
Hurts me soul
It hurts me so, soul
Whoa-oh
Hurts me soul (Yeah)

To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit

No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home

Guess I gotta forget all about this issue
And try to live my life just like it is
Whooa
But I want everybody to remember me (everybody)
I will come back 10 years ago (well, hey)
Said I want everybody to remember me
When I go back 10 years and years ago
When I get my second chance

When I get my second chance I’m gon' redeem myself
When I bring myself, me and my team my help
Ain't no “I” in that but I’m in that so I am packed
Like there's ten of me inside of that
Ain't one man army, one man army I am that
Bring it back like a typer-writer, writing that
I attack like a lightning strike with a lions wrath
With a vipers bite come alive with that
Put your life on that
Like everything I do though
All my old wounds have all healed but they still feel like they new though
And everytime I see ‘em I start to think of you yo
First I wasn’t focused, wasn’t willing and my goon’s
So performance was just lackin at those moments that were crucial
Now my heart is razor sharp and confidence is MUCHO
Big, things I can’t forgive, things I can't forget
Things I can’t relive, the agony is asking me, defeat is sweet to sin
But I put that on my city we will never meet again

The rise of the phoenix, sweat falls
Time has its meaning, I evolve
Hit the ground and bounce back up, just like B-Ball
Muhammad Ali jaw, I knew that I would be all
Far from where I came from, the same place that pain's from
My name hung, from the rafters before an aftermath of a master
Wishing I could have the moment to grab the trophy and glass of champagne
My locker rooms a cold place, LA got no gates
You mighta seen this man cry, that was just my old face
My soul waits redemption and intervention from a higher dimension
Inspire mission, no more hoping or wishing, conditions’ll change
Stickers say Barack on the range
I’m from the Chi’ too, now I’m Barack in the game
Came back and overcame, overstood the rain
More than just the fame, married to the game
Now I hold the reign

She said there was no love in her heart
'Cause one day a rapist attacked her and broke that all apart
She said there was no way to fix it or to cover her scars
Then one day a guy came along that probably could help her start
He was sincere, made her believe it was safe for her to trust again
Before long, she was cool with givin' hugs to him
Knew that it was right 'cause somethin' was wrong
The alarms in her mind didn't tell her he didn't belong

Now lil' Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop, told her "Lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag, take the pennies out the drawer"
Lil' Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots, and black hat
He gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs, then we can get a soccer ball
That's what my commander say
How old? Well I'm like ten, eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government want me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still too young
This candy give me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear

Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A macabre parade of the toys he made
In shemaghs and shades, who look half his age
About half the size of the flags they wave
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a lil' loose
Where AK47s that they shooting into heaven
Like they tryna kill a Jetson, the struggles, little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, devoid of all childish ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words that's on they own graves
Think you gangsta? Popped a few rounds?
These kids'll come through and murder a whole town
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down, it's—
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
There's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We need you now, blaow!

Imagine if I had to console
The families of those slain I slayed on game consoles
I aim, I hold right trigger to squeeze
Press up and Y, one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silent, she don't approve of violent games
She leave, resume activity
Scarred and blue heart, of hard, sharp wizardry
On next part, I insert code
To sweeten up the little person's murder workload
I tell him he work for CIA with A
A operative, I operate this game all day
I hold the controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder
He's only seconds older than me
We playful but serious
Now keep that on mind for online experience, ugh!
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon

Surely, we can start from scratch like default
When they say you're not my baby like Maury
You can tell 'em that they're telling a story
Testify like you're telling a jury
And I'll repeat like you said it before me
We undefeated like a veteran army
And we as heavy as an elephant, aren't we?
Let's take 'em to the zoo, or better yet a safari
They want me to leave my Dame like the fella from Marcy (No!)
But we go way back like a set of Atari's
From baby fat 'til we skeletons darling
"Me" starring "You" is what it says on the marquee
So let's go give them a show, on my heart, get set, go!

When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

Or is it something they can never believe?
Or is it something you can never achieve?
Is it beyond your means? Is it inside your dreams?
Can it never come out cause it's scared to, unprepared to
Too worried about the words of the people it's weird to
You don't want them to hear you
You just wish there was a door that would appear
That you can go disappear through
Well I'm feeling your pain
I was feeling the same, but I said I'd never feel that again

At the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as happy folk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, strange folk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage
Hidden behind dark glasses
And no one noticed them
They only saw shadows
You see
Without the truth of the eyes
The happy folk were blindYou might also likeEmbed

That, mixed with a little bit of pimp and a little bit of mack
And a little bit of limp, and a whole lotta gangsta lean

Pharaoh, pharaoh?
Pharaoh

Dollar mission, Mississippi Masala getting
Guava Casaba melons, getting a spot at competition
Titties and teeth, so silly of me, no really, it’s free
Aye you can use the phone like a new computer wand
That’s an Ethernet pun, cause dial-up’s all done
When it took twenty minutes just to download one
Aye, you got a fine face, also a dime in your behind
Please can I find some time space to find base
Kinds of rhymes to describe how you’re designed great
And maybe remove the mind freight
Like it’s overhead cranes at the train yard
That Tom Cruise used in the War of the World's
Before the aliens came part
Remember that? Oh, not a fan of the sci-fi?
Like dial-up’s not a fan of the wi-fi
I’m in your eyes like little reflective little pools of tie-dye
And it’s 1972 and I’m some long-haired high guy
Driving a Volkswagen Beetle off into the California twilight
I usually got top cause I’m a guy right
But if you’re gay that’s straight too
Hey, I don’t hate, I got a couple of friends who went bi twice
Did that arrive right?
Do you like whole stories or just the highlights
Cause I like to write your life story on the sky
Made of Lite Brites, remember those?
Ten years old, let me guess your age
You were a ten, ten years ago
Am I right, who you calling?
Maybe New Orleans where your mother lives
With your brother's kids
Cause he locked up cause
Of what some other motherfucker did
Love to fib 'bout the Fibonacci sequence
Do you flicker like Liberace Sequins
Or maybe twinkle like little stars
And tingle like little scars
I run a wrinkle with you like a car hood
And crash test and beat-box while we rewrite
Saul Williams doing the slam set
Then wrap like saran over the pan
Keep the yams fresh, sweet
Five different songs, over five different beats
And this one’s called Valley
I wrote it on the plane in the chair by the galley
On the way to Cali, chicken in the salad
Sounds like a ballad
You loyal, so I’m Khaled
Buy your momma a palace
Scratch that, buy your momma what matters
Data says dollars hotter than two Nevadas
Burning hole in the pockets
And in the wallets of all the rappers
Trappers attracting all the yellowbone Instagrammers

Back when I listened to Killah Priest
Had my mind thicker and bigger than Philip Heath
Walking round in kufis with sunnis with dhikr beads
Remembering the movies my duty was killing beats
Social villain unwilling to live in peace
I told you children I’m wielding a living beast
Streets, this is where Helen and Ellen meet
So you can get lost like Gilligan on the beach
The players getting mad they not kicking it with the freaks
Cause they took away they pussy and giving it to the geeks
Like us, paradigm shifter, South Carolina Nine shrine shine giver
But not enough dimes to be a crime line tipper
The difference between "nigga", and "niggar"
Uh, Bernie Sanders need a Nike deal

If Phil Knight knight him, then I might like him

Young peerer over Dilla
Behind the mic like the wheel of a vehicular killer
The threading, put it together like a three minutes to wedding
In less than three minutes of meddling, over melody and grand piano peddlings
I do represent the mind like IQs, intelligent signs in our kinds of haiku
Cobra Kai turn high top fade to Caillou, who inspect a man stance and fight the kaiju
Way beyond a hundred kicks, breaking bottom bricks and he on number six
This is that “there should be a name for it”
Hideo should go and make a game for it
Mama should make you change for it
Kinda rap that sends jaguars running back into the rain forest
Plans over panic, when Superman scans deadpan over planets
Make the fat man hand over the ham jam and lamb and Spam sandwich
A face black eyes and hand-to-hand damage
Make ‘em believe you can manage to have swam the span, fam
It's Sesame the bird big, and the master plan mammoth
Yeah!

FlyLo, Lupe, I go

Metabolize on the scattered snare
With the banana pies that he don't like
Like mosquito bites on the shins or ankles
In the end it bends
Let's begin and pretend it's tranquil
Upset stomach on the boat to Lucerne to see the lion
Carved in the wall by the pond
To commemorate the soldier dying over old divines
Ergo sum empire, not the inch but the entire
More pills mean more spills by the whore house with the extra door
To let the divorced out with force
And other course routes, of course
Cleopatra speaking patois with a mouth full of that jerk chicken
With rum in hand for the curse lifting
Onion bread with the shine to it
It's up and fair to define stupid
But she ain't dumb, at least she know that he ain't fun
And neither's Europe, even to the Middle Eastern tourists
Where oil is spent by the drum load
How many millionaires can the slums hold?
Potentially all of us, this whole plane and all the bus
As juggernauts bust through a wall of trust
You strain to see through the fog of dust
Like spaghetti for the meatballs
Of dust Parmesan immaculates
Head over heels like a back is flipped
The Japanese don’t perceive Atlanta-ness
Love labors, get her backstage like the judge chambers
Everyone under the sun loves hugs from a young stranger
Or do us, oh foo us
On boats in the Bay of Pigs
Runaways wait with the wayward kids
And the underpaid slaves from Jamaican gigs
Don't shoe us, cause we ain't Bush
We ain't hoofs don't boo us cause we ain't cooked
But who else could hook the fufu up
In this book I mean, dumplings with dark continents
Dumb things even bar common sense
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes a terpin intertwines with the turbans
Vines with turbans and removes the minds of serpents
Detergents, deterrents and permits, to build a hut
Twerk team, Operation Build-a-Butt
Great like Gildersleeve
As a king breathes through a silver sieve
Jack and Jill ain't up that hill enough
Filtering lean through a gold grill
Theorize things from swole hills
They came became what that po' kills
Throw ho drills on that hotel, that'll oil spill
Looking at space from a submarine
Putting that bass in the club machine
Pushing that cake till it mush in that face ain't no love between
Fancy ass man wearing glove and rings
Flying round town in a tub of wings
Found out how to make love to fiends
He mixing that fudge with the drug of dreams
She too teenage to have a drug of choice
But she fuck with that Royce like she love Detroit
She rollin'

What?
(Can you please tell us a bedtime story?)
Ugh, it's late man
Okay, okay okay, check this out, listen

Cold killer, bold old guerrilla
Bold as a font with the thickness
Old as yellow gold in a Chevrolet with a stick shift
The story goes his mother left him on a church step
First step was out the front door then the first left
Down the block to the spots where the worst kept
Thirty years later got a thirty tier caper
To shoot up the scene and scheme
Plot, broken all down to two rounds of scotch
A pound means now and we too down to stop
Say ya got enough round for two thousand cops
Military grade, these things shoot round the block
Shh threat, check
The dame will hang out like chains round the neck
He ever seen her before, her face don't connect
No, so keep it on the low, go
Seizes her by the arm
Looks right into the eyes cause these be the charms
Sheba, King Tut suite at the Khalifa
Tied to a chair getting burned by Cohibas
A well dressed thug who run clubs in the Koreas
The room smells like fresh hand made tortillas
He recognized the tattoos of a real big Maui brother
Known for bad news when his cash rules
Are you familiar with the shell of the cashews?
As he holds the needle up to the light bulb
White girls enter drunk, he stands up runs to the window and jumps
Aim for the pool... splash
The impact from that almost split him in half
Voice from the past asks did he enjoy the bath
Laughs with his arm in a cast, hold up

As he tried to do the math with Smearcon the fed
The contract states from here upon you're dead
The girl at the bar is an underworld star
Settling on debts with north Zanzibar
Your name's on the list, kitsch
A hundred million dollars worth of high grade fish
Tuna, Tokyo cartels worlds biggest consumer
A rumor bout a schooner off the coast of Montezuma
They say you slit the throat of a well known kahuna
Then torched the boat and fled into the Dunya
You’re hated more than a Kalua pig at a Jumu'ah
They want your head on a platter, not right now but sooner
I got you a .45 and a Mitsubishi tuner
Wait, wait I've never been to Costa Rica
And then it all comes back
Just as Smearcon falls with a ninja star in his head like..huh
Then they slowly enter the room
I grabbed a .45, the ninja stars resume
I catch him in the cast and answer them with a blast, blow
Three more shots for good measure
Only exit is another window, pfft, whatever
Short fall to the roof of the car
Then I get in, left arm covered in ninja stars
Then a zero to a hundred baby real quick
Look around the car for something else to kill with
Lamborghini headlights in the rear view
These Parisian streets not meant to veer through
Especially with just one hand
I let go to shoot back but the gun jams
Mitsubishi not built to outrun Lambs
So they gaining, heavy raining
Rear view explodes from deadly aiming
Arm paining, blood draining
Pains, head for the Louvre
Drive right through the glass pyramid with dope moves
A little shook from the landing
Driving through the Louvre in a rally car with great handling
Was at the Mona Lisa
Stop the car right in front of the Delacroix and have a breather
Press play on the radio, voice from the speaker
Says get to Belgrade and take an ad out in the daily Politika
They says for a good time call this Ecuador slash Venezuelan chica
Next day at the airport meeted by a greeter who looks Corsican but Greeker
A little older wearing Michael Jordan sneakers
But I follow the leader
1995 S. Class, in the back seat is a dead man whose car I just crashed
Smearcon's alive, audience now wonders how Smearcon survived
Let alone not be hurt, he taps a metal plate in his head from his Afghanistan work
What Visine for red retinas, what else would you expect from head predators
Ex-lecturer, at Exeter, the dean too secular
So now I'm totes hecklers, everywhere
Now Smearcon's on the team, so everybody's down for the scheme
(The final chapter in the incredible ape saga)
(Smearcon's back!)

Now it's time to finish this, getting too late for international syndicates
To which the driver reveals his membership
This won't end well, he pulls out a grenade and says
(Damn you all to hell!)
(Wait, what happened? Uncle Lupe what's going on?)
Go to sleep
(But what happened? I don't understand)
Nope

Take me to memories we won’t erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad
I’ll never forget you
I’ll never let you go

Let the record reflect the records we set
Best foot forward with every step
And let’s push towards it, never regress
And let’s remember, if ever we get
Down, the places that we came from ’round
And all the good times on the bad side of town
The upside of bad, flip it upside down
Came from the bottom but we up high now
Believe, and from this view we achieved
We looked back at the rules we received
And how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those
And the ghost still alive in the photos

Back, to the first written rap
The crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap
The hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat
The hookers on the corner and the kids sellin’ crack
The needles in the yard where we used to play catch
Stories from the project we could never go at
Or to, these are shades of my youth
Trials of a child, everything truth
Moments of the past, comin’ back to find us
Not to relive them, just to remind us

I'm a klepto stealing
And it gets the best
Just when I guess that I left those leanings

I was born in a small village
I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers
Foreign soldiers
Torn from my elders, I was made to speak their language
With each new post, my masters changed
Along with the words they made me speak
With each change, I changed too
My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong
Words can kill
Time and again, the country was ruled by a foreign tongue
When he was a young boy, he lost his native language
The bedrock for any developing child
His country, his family, his face, his identity
Everything was stolen from him

Meet me on the corner, I be waiting on you
Thousand years of better right into forever
Fire on my feathers, fall from out of heaven
Fight without a weapon, life without a lesson
Lost, I'm my own boss, pay my own cost
Fill my own goals, see my own hopes
Tired of all of this, wish I had a switch
One kiss then you cut me off
Knowledge is the power, college is for cowards
Hollering for hours, swallowing the sour
Skin stuck around the rims, peeking in on a life so sweet
The other side made it, why don't we?

From ancient times, every civilization's ruler has had the same idea. When people unite under one will, they become stronger than the sum of their parts and what do rulers use to bring people together? Language. "This world will become one, I have found the way. Race, tribal affiliations, national borders - even our faces will be irrelevant. The world that the boss envisioned will finally become a reality and it will make mankind whole again
Found a friend in the words and my words and it works
Take away the pain, take away the hurt
Make a way to make a change, make it sane
Specially if you plan on staying on this Earth
Low to the lows, high to the highs
Eyes to the sky, strive to revive, dying to survive
Pool full of cries but it's cool, I'm still alive
And every breath is every left soul
And the family never kept whole
In the slum, want to quest to be the best of being less
Never let go, the best road to the next level
And the scenes where it's mean to do the right thing
Not to be a good king but the best devil
So it's horns for the crown, torn from the ground
Roses by the roots stolen from the roofs on parade days
Look at them rain down
I was brought here a slave
But I leave here a pharaoh
America is a country of liberty, a meeting of immigrants
Instead of simply assimilating, its citizens live alongside others
So the major sought a system that used information
Words to control the subconscious
In his eyes, the greatest symbiotic parasite the world's ever known isn't microbial -- it's linguistic
Words is what keep civilization, our world, alive
If you are what you say you are, the coolest
Won't you just shine down?
You are what you say you are, the coolest

Holy assumption of man into the heaven's sphere
Many mansions fit champions within its seven tiers
Evangelists re-imagine every 11 years
Pause for applause, evolves to what was never here
Born to death, born to die
Form the flesh, form the eyes
A veritable storm of winged forms swarms the skies
Marital norms unperformed but the porn survives
In the dorms of the scorn, they keep warm supplies
Gone to lose the use of tooth, horn and thigh
Before I was standing, I was landing
Two one-hand, one-man bands jamming in tandem
He who power naps, then plans gathering ransoms
And maps man's laps in a hand lathered in absinthe
Got a talent trafficking ramblings
And handing out amazing handmade maps of the labyrinth
Out the back of the wagon, out the back of the madam
Out the back of the Magnum, then out the trap of enchantment
Bellerophon with a megaphone, Mega Man
Desert zone, run marathons with sweaters on (sweaters on)
That was so simple but hot
In a place where it's so simple but not
Closed temples and old little forgots
And rode whole chisels, cripples who won't miss a salat
The old hoes that they won't give you a shot
But you can get the whole  pistol, it's gon' hit you a lot
These are real words from a savage mind
Unmaximized man on an average climb
Who don't deserve the whole truth and only half your time
Fit the life of a whole booth in only half a line
In the future life, I don't even have to rhyme
We'll get the entire Armageddon with only half the signs
Just yields and rail roads
In lush fields with bell tolls
Couple huddles of the unskilled but well told
It's unreal how off one deal to sell souls
And he got 'em by the dozen
Medulla oblongata is what got them by the oven
Like how the moonshine is what got him by the cousin
He got her by the bottom and he 'bout to stick his tongue in
Such an unsettling scene
An obscene setting for the unwedding of rings
The sharpest dresser at the unheading of queens
The architecture is something you've never seen
Dream clean, that's three words at the same time
And killed three birds with the same--
And won each and every hand with the same bluff and
Answers each and every man with the same question
What is it? But you still wanna know but I already done did it
I ball heavy, the physics
It's all, but it's already specific
If we doing what's already done, that means it's already terrific
That's rather meta-poetic, and just to acknowledge that
As an extra exhibit to what's already within it
The galleries lack the wall space
So I made a gallery of galleries, made of all space
If it was more small, it would be Moore's Law
From the land of the po' where we war, saw
From the hand of a pro to a whore jaw
Make her stand at the store 'til the snow thaw
Went from paper boy to editor
From throwing Ars Poetica with the arms of Federer
On the porches and steps to the farm houses of settlers
One of several sects who can come and charm the predators
We who measure the measuring tools of measurers
We who pleasure the pleasure tubes of pleasurers
We who lecture at treasured schools of lecturers
We who question the treasured rules of leveragers
Born to death, born to die
Mourn correct: immortalize
In a war, where your performance score is your salary
It's like fantasies combating your mortality
I'm just trying to restore sanity
Sigmund Freud boy, Leroy to your Vanity
To instill what kills krill destroys manatee
So heels spill but still seal deals that build factories
What looks Roman senator inner reveals Maccabees
Never just trust off guts, but what's actually
Unless it's Kuato's
Now, we back to pillars of salt, I recall back peeling potatoes
In hindsight, maybe attack of killer tomatoes
A seasoned shoulder's carrying plenty Pentium payloads
Now, that's another strata but I was making sense
Then cop out, took the highway and I was making chips
A nappy-head Karate Kid, I was breaking bricks
Can fight like Tekken 5, even taking 6
This rehabilitation, I be taking trips
"Don't Ruin Us" God said, I won't make a dent
Hardly, but I'm still Harvey, I hope this making sense
Devil tooting his own horn, don't come and take a sniff
In the streets you gotta fight, you get punished for taking whiffs
To make that change for your team, you gotta have New Jersey Drive and a stomach for taking whips
I'm just trying to redeem
With these hands full of bars, don't beat me for coming clean
To unify the hooks, if you know it, then come and sing
Don't bust in while I'm asleep, nightmares who come in dreams
Samurais rarely die from another sword
This is 1985 meets the hover board
That was Bobby Johnson potato, just to underscore
Think deep, but don't let it fry your motherboards

Peace, no material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath, attain wisdom and refuse graft
And build upon what I built on and wisely regulate time I do have
Cause what is defeat? But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste, so I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove schism when the rules missin'
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships
Just invest in my business and appreciative of the rarity of my existence

'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs

Let my son hold my strap while I swim laps in the pool
Told my daughter the rules which we all must abide
Your daddy was far from perfect, things we did to survive
I just wanted to fly, they always lookin' down on us
School district full of killers, I mean these niggas ferocious
Only violence and drugs, there was nothin' for us
All I had was this music, I couldn't afford to do much

Cause he ain't really livin' life 'less he's down to roll the dice
Put it all on the line for a couple dollars

Chasin' woodgrain and the leather
Puttin' pressure on the pedal, I don't want the devil
Hopin' he, fall
Feed him to his nonsense, mothafuck a contract
You don't need a handout, they gon' bring the bands out

Maybe so, you don't give a fuck in a rut nigga
'Til those in the street got you stuck nigga, what nigga?
Buck buck nigga
Buried your partner just the other day knowin' he was too young
Had a tool, tryna roll on the folk
Let it go on the folk but he wasn't down to shoot one
Though the time dead and gone, is YOLO what we on?
I heard different, it's never too late to listen and be reborn
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga, go be reborn
Peace and understandin' is what you should be on

Don't matter what's at stake, just let it burn, don't e'en look down at your grill
Either way we gon' ball, look around at your wheels
Even the baby gon' ball, look around at your wheels
This ain't my shit, this our shit
Look around what you build and that's great and shape
And you should look inside how you feel
You look and sound like you trill, you look inside for that feel

Microphone check, I make 'em all bounce
Every teller in Bank of America—make them all count
You gon' need the whole staff to add up the amount—
It's going to take to pay me off to keep me out your house
To keep me in my zone so that I don't zone out
I'm rich and poor like Zone 4, thoughts is deep like Tone Loc
Walk with me like old folk, cross your street a score's goaled
I don't rap—I hockey rink, 'cause my flow is so cold
I am on my "Mhm," they are on they "Oh, no!"
I am really in here; they ain't real like Soul Glo
Don't you know I'm so sure? Them niggas got no glow
Find a master 'fore you can come back into the dojo
Lupe got his mind right; nigga, this is my mic
And I've come to take it all back like Miller High Life
He must not be tied tight, back against the wall
He will throw a ball like he playing jai-alai
I'll do the register—you just get them fries right
I don't trust America after watching Zeitgeist
Take a look at my stripes: Chest look like a tiger arm
And I'm hot as tiger balm, fire like a five-alarm
And it's set to Tire Barn, get your firefighter on
I ain't worried about you hoes—I don't even need to roll
I turn down your ex like how you put your tires on
Once I get these tires on, I buy a bomb and tie it on
And ride this around the entire song, find a line to drive it on
Park it near a metaphor; wait for it—the timer's on
You can turn your hydrants on; I'll just turn my wipers on
Wipe it off, then wipe me down, but don't forget about my bomb!You might also like1Embed

To stay in the zone that I go in
That I go in, when I go in and go in
Of the poems, that were wrote and
Crucial Conflict was smokin'
But a nigga like me, I don't be chokin'
So I proceed at a low speed, low key
Like a OG in a '03 Loc-in'
Rollin' like a OZ, in a b-leaf
Both pins, like a bowlin' ball when I ball
But I never fall for the okey-dokin'
Whitewalls and the slow-speed motion
Stash-box for the police pokin'
Rolie showin, shorty showin, Hokey Pokin'
Turnin' it around with me
To bust 'em down cause they know he golden
Exactly, I'm in it from the minute I was in it

Want to have things, couldn't afford a Pelle
So don't mind me, cause I ain't got a mind
I don't front hard, I ain't got a mind
I'm just gettin' mine, but don't step here
Because it's something buried, that I didn't find

That's wolf-man, you got a full house
I got a full moon, then I pull out

Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there? (yeah, are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)
Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?

We were like, "If a tree falls in the forest and
No one is around, does it really make a sound?"
That's romantic and profound, but now
We're like lumberjacks holdin' the axes that brung it down
So I'm now on your message, talkin' 'bout "Remember?"
Silence in return, that sound like 'Timber!"
There's some that can't see the forest because they're liars
But I can't see the forest 'cause of the fire
And in our prehistorics, the flowers was rootin' for us
Brontosaurus ate the flowers, T-Rex ate the Brontosaurus
And then the T-Rex turned around and ate the florist
That's why I lost my FTD endorsements
But that's really not important
My sadness' a snitch, my melancholy informant
Despair wears a wire, my longin' rappin' a song
My worry is a rat, my lonely tappin' the phone
Feeling kinda restless
Did you get my message?
It's swirling around and so (uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
I wanna give you reasons (yeah)
Tell you what I'm feeling
But none of these lines are secure (nah)
No, don't tell me that you care (uh huh)
When I know you're standing there (yeah)
I left the story of my life on your answering machine (what else? Uh huh)
My tears run off your shoes (yeah)
Like waters from a goose (uh)
You try to wash off all the dirt
But your hands aren't getting clean

Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there?
Hello, would you pick up the phone?
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there? (are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)
Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?

The make-believers on receivers as you sit back and observe
As the rubber curly cord just absorbs all my words
Will you collect us then connect us or neglect us on the whole?
Into the wall, then cross the wires on the telephone poles
Then bounces off the towers, then up into the satellites
Then falls down back to Earth to bring a broken heart back to life
Happens all the time, lost an appetite and lack of sleep
If it's dead and flatten line, I'll leave a message at the beep
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there? (Hello, are you there? Yeah)
Hello, would you pick up the phone? (Come on)
Hello, can you hear me? (Come on)
Hello, are you there? (Come on)
Hello, would you pick up the phone?
Would you pick up the phone?
Would you pick up the phone?
Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?18Embed
Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective
Chapter 3: Gravy
---Download Complete--- Hmmm looks like I'll be heading upstairs.
The cab stinks. The stale intensity of so many burned out digital cigar cores left to decay on the floor. The acid graffiti. It doesn't fit.
Not fit transport for somebody "Going Upstairs" as they say. We all say that. Some champagne and classical music would be nice.
Maybe a chauffeur would give the trip up top a fancier sentiment. I mean the best of us should travel with a little more class and dignity.
This is like being in a port-o-potty with thrusters. A couple coughs. A well aimed spit. Yeah thats how the "Best Of Us" do it, precisely.
Up through the clouds. Directly into the Moon. We pass through it. It's only a meter thick. So warm. So fake. Color is still wrong to me.
The cab slows to a halt. Border patrol scans the ID tags. All clear. One step down. Disinfection nozzles spray the cab down. Missed a spot.
Step three is up next. Blindness. Total sensory disconnect. 3 seconds. 3 weeks. It's all the same in "non-sense." Helpless. Out of touch.

---------------!!! Awww Nice. Grass. Glass. Nothing else. Central Fucking Park Baby! It's all tai-chi and vegan techno utopia. Upstairs.
NH is Downstairs. Can't see it from here. Shit I wouldn't wanna see it either. Most these folks never have. Never will. Where's my devil?
Birthing out of Non-sense mode is always a mellow moment. Has to be or the shock would give you a heart attack. Wish I could smoke here.
Man would you look at that. The real Sun. Son of a bitch. My devil approaches. His name is 11. Mid level manager at a pill manufacturer.
I don't believe him. He's not my devil. Too many questions. He's just checking me out. He knows I know. He changes to his real voice.
All this espionage. Games. The real voice isn't really right either. Neither are the eyes. All tests. The "air" is thick with nano-machines
It's like wading in a pool of thin water. It's what moves things here. A seamless, all encompassing soup of nano-machines & information.
A spoonful of this stuff would sell for millions back Downstairs if we had real sunlight to keep it alive that is. What'd he say???!!!
"That's right Mr.Teriyaki (-It's Joe!-) I want you to bring my daughter back."

Gold medals, them my role models
Rollin' old models lowered old schools, flowin' cold
And goin' gold follows
Flower bearin', call it petals to the floor
Power sharin', call it devils to the door
Power, power, 'til ain't no devils anymore
Flower-flowers, they be droppin' at the feet of my sun
Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
And who do I meet, to the beat of my drum?
It was little Susie Uzi, she sold crack and was a killer
All-bitch dope tip, wasn't trappin' with no niggas
Had a long money minor, do that action for them figures
Her influence fully automatic, crackin' off the Richter, yeah!
Walked up to my ride, asked me "Could she get inside?"
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition
And with me up on them beats
Then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips, she said
"Now here's my proposition:
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em
Then we take 'em to the record store
And sell a couple million," woo!

Ugh, told me call up Soundtrakk, have him send a couple beats
Not that "Superstar" shit, she wanted somethin' for the streets
Said it might take like a month, she said, "It better take a week"
Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat
Said, "I saw that thing the first time, you don't gotta do it twice
But I need a lil' more info on exactly what I write
Some details 'bout a female, 'bout your life and what you like"
She said, "My life is like a bitch, and I'm just like my life"
Then pow-pow-pow-pow-pow! Yeah, them niggas started bustin'
Like that boycott was over and that "we" had overcome it
She said, "Nigga, hit the gas," went from zero to a hundred
Now we runnin' from some killers, I was so sick to my stomach
She was hangin' out the window, with that thumper she was dumpin'
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin'
We was swervin', jumped the curb, and ditched the whip and started runnin'
Tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall
So we ducked behind a bush and that's how we got overlooked
I was shook and breathin' hard and she was sittin' there smokin' kush
Then we both started to glow, we looked around like, "What is this?"
And then we looked up and a light
Came down and pulled us to a ship like, "What the fuck?"
I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen (Shit!)

Well, now, this the shit I'm talkin' 'bout, the shit that I've been on
Yeah, lightyears outer space, but still a bitch feel right at home
Now where the bitches? Get them intergalactic asses to clappin'
Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper
Nah, I could never go back to trappin'
And who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lap dance
With a lit match in your left hand and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment, I could burn this shit up
Why you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up
Hop in some of this alien pussy, let me know how it work
I'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush
(Nah nigga!) Nah nigga, I ain't in no rush

Ayy, I thought you couldn't rap, when you learn how to do that?
Then what you need me for, if you already know how to flow?
Ayy, fuck that, we gotta go, we'ldn't be in this hoe
If you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO
But I think that I can fly us, stole a key so I can try it
Never thought that I would ever be a flyin' saucer pilot
But first thing's gon' be first, when we get back to that earth
I'ma go back to them raps and you can go back to that work, nigga
I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
Nigga we're goin' home, home!
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen
You can kill me, I don't care—no!

Ayy, look, the basic thing is
You can do whatever you wanna do
Like I ain't 'bout to pass up on all this shit, you see this?
Like we time jumpin' and shit
You wanna go back and do what, just rap?

Oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

What if I said, love was a lie though?
It was more like hate with a eye closed
And the other eye, had the eye rolled
That's contempt and ignorance, I know
But what do I know?
Only thing that I seen was the inside, of a blindfold
And you just as blind as me
So how I look? Askin' you where do I go
Eye and I keep high hope alive though
That love's not a lie it just likes to lie low
Likes to hide right there in plain sight
And you got to find it with your eyes, closed
And in the dark, you see the part
Of your partner that's the heart
If you die, it's like apartheid, we can bring it back to the, start

It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
No, it's not designed to make you feel love
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Oh no, yeah
You might also like
On second thought, leave apartheid in the grave
But the heart part, that can be saved
The hard part's makin' sure it don't break
Into little sharp pieces that are hard to replace
Hard to find spare arteries these days
In decent shape and know things'll decay
And at these rates you're gon' need to be paid
Like three-ty ways just to see D. Wade
To the place that sells these parts
That you couldn't keep safe from the stee-art
So why would we waste our art on your mistake
When you was drivin' reckless? Didn't pump the brakes
Hate to have to shoot you down
A fine runnin' heart makes a soothin' sound
It's junkyard love in your future, pal
Didn't appreciate it then, bet you do, now

It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
On no no!
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Oh oh oh, yeah, hey baby
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Noooo baby
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Never gonna make you feel, nooo, babe
And in the futuristic
Love will be reduced to physics
Computer digits made by robots
That use statistics, algorithms and group logistics
The mood-resistant
Downloadable thing that's used specific
Easily updated with few commitments
Can find its way home if you forget it
Say, maybe on a starship tour
Heard a knock at your starship door
It was the girl that you had met at the starship bar
Had a dance on the starship floor
But then you got starship sick
So you had to run to the starship store
And then you got those starship pills
But when you back, she wasn't there no more
She says, "Hope you got a starsuit at the starship store
Maybe we can take a trip
To take a look at the stars around parsec 4"
And it was the most beautiful thing
You both had ever seen in your lives before
And she pulled out her love
So you reached down in your starsuit for
But your pockets empty now the moments passed
And it'll probably never happen like this again
I guess it didn't work out for you in the, end
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
On no no, yeah a-yeah
It's not designed to make you feel that way now, baby (oh no)
Not designed! Not designed baby! Hoo, hoo baby
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
Not designed! Not designed! No no no no no no no oh

Oh oh
No no, baby
Hoo hoo, ahh, baby6Embed

When you got popped up and you got locked up
And the block shot up and your girl knocked up
And your kids be like, "Who gonna watch us?"
Your mama, they nana
When you ball too hard or your money got spent
So you got kicked out, you ain't have no rent
But you still had a place where you could go
Tell me where you went, your mama
Soon as they let me outta jail
Went straight to my mama's house
Need someone I can talk to
And a little more time to work all these dramas out
That lawyer money, that bail money
Those letters in the mail never fail you, homie
Who visit when niggas don't visit?
Man, she the realest, boy, let me tell you somethin'
You better love your mama

I’m bout that, I’m bout that, that Bentley out in that driveway
Cost more than my house did, fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly, credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m gettin’ back but in luxury I arrive (turn up)
IPhone in my baby name, long way from that chirp
Stripper pole in my bedroom, but I’ma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’ma kill my daughter if she twerk, Miley Cyrus on that bullshit
But a real nigga can’t judge, that for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college, missed out but no Pyrex
My Harley got low mileage (and this white carpet in my project)
Thirty guns in my section, none of the homies got aim
My side bitch said she pregnant, but I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game, I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
And this one is mine, I don’t trust his momma so he don’t got my name
Cheap rims on  my ride, mirrors loose as my beat pound
I ain’t addicted to shit, but weed man on my speed dial

Yeah, uhh, f-f-filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)
Car cosigned by my momma (Momma)

Ayy, FMJ’s by the box, nigga
Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga
Shouldn’t find that surprising
Cause I bought the motherfucker from a cop
Ayy, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby can’t afford me
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried

Fuck being a hip-hop purist

Embrace the contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can’t fill us, Medicaid can’t heal us
And the mommas can’t stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up
Sayin' "Free the guys" like I'm Durk (them hittas!)

Ghetto, uh, uh
Ghetto, ghetto (yeah)
Ghetto (uh) ghetto

Ghetto mythologies colonize my mind constantly
To shine sonically in the Chi, Divine Comedy
I vibe consciously to override suicide inside
Honestly 'cause they don't wanna honor me and honesty
Black king poetic with Nat King's aesthetic
Half-dream, half-machine where the black queens get naked
For a dollar from a scholar like me
Not at all bothered with what a sodomite see, flippant
A thousand grams get dissolved in the kitchen
Heart wrenchin', part played, took away from my ascension
Crooked ways brought from car lookaways from tooken Js
But it's too late for your prevention 'cause I'm playin' my position

I'm the man now

Sin and swim in my trunk like jumps in deeper ends
We the gems, your daughter, we'll teach her hymns
From the annals of crime channels that dismantle her wants for weaker men
Send 'em back, a livin', I'm feelin' trapped
We no religion but brimmin' with brilliant facts
So we map cast distorted role of a lady
With no control, let her go whole on a baby
I wanna see it all, never half asleep some niggas can't see the walls
'Cause of the masterpiece my data breach like hacker leaks
Delete the McAfees and slam the backdoors in back of me
Social engineer, peers stare at it, give a chat to me happily
Actually activated off accolades of my apogee
And act yakkity then deeply speak it back to me
Then move it further, we can have a junta or a jerga
I smurf it and spoof the server, reboot and produce a cursor

I'm a man now

If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now
Not the man then keep your motherfuckin' hands down
Man now (ghetto, ghetto)
I'm the man, now
Deny the service and a little blue from the boycott
Advertise rum, space available on my toy box
But no sleepin' on me, dig deeper than reachin' shorties
Scheme for giant green, getting CREAM sweeter than bein' corny
Know the difference between bein' in love and bein' horny
Bein' hated, bein' human, bein' a teen but bein' forty
They like to get 'em young like I'm Brigham's son
Be more man and my attitude' no lad, I'd rather have a youth
Flag the OGs pullin' Benzos out
They make 'em put they pussies out like Fred Flintstone's house
Heart blacker than the back of Fred Flintstone mouth
Or maybe more like Baba Kwesi, take the TEMBO route
To be

As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said

I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either

Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?

Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become a actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash 'em down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

Lu myself, first of all accuse myself for being a fool
All attempts to school myself have failed
To improve means to remove myself
From this pool of sharks, dark as the mood I felt
I’m losing fuel, that’s all the food I refuse myself
That’s how you do when you do yourself
And if I lose, I could never excuse myself
Till I grow old, sit back and accrue my wealth
You don’t stand a chance, matter of fact, you don’t have half the stance
To stand if you stood half a chance
Like c-h-a to dance with this man from the C.H.A’s
Give it up, just abandon plan
Since you don’t have half the stance like an amputee
You don’t have half the pants that it takes
To command a family
The fan or command a fee
So you will never get the ransom you demand from me
The good news, my foot’s loose, my hands is free
So I dance all footloose and fancy free
Big Ups to footloose and all the fans of me
My fan base expands from Vans to Timberlands
From mansions to Section 8 campuses B
I’m they champion and I ain’t even SoundScanned it, see, I been lamping
Whipping up an answer to these rappers who got it backwards
Like zipping up their pants to pee
Like I’m just a rapper and I ain’t dapper
I'm frequently fly, I can go to France for free
But I ain’t no fan in base, cooking up grams of C
We in a wet stretching O’s like rubber bands to feed
But that was white boy 100 grand to key
When I’m posted up with this little punk ass chump cash advance
That they handing me, I came back with birds like Brandon Lee
I came back with words in a stanzas G
Told ya, right back like Stan, I'mma stand till it answers me
I’m concentrating man, I'm an oscillating fan
When they wanna shake hands with me, it sucks right now
Hear it through ya spirit just dampens B
Like damn that was my man, what the hell happened to he?
His fan base is disbanded B
‘Cause his lyrics don’t mirror when he first landed see
Don’t give into this land to please
So help me God, I'mma kill it, that’s my word
Remove this blindfold, just give us a chance to see
And I'mma quit it the minute it abandons me
My plan’s to be here for a minute
Then I’m finished, then I’m vamping G
Most these cats is pussies, pearl tongues, oysters and clams to me
Flintstone money can’t even stand being in their glances geez
They say it’s looking good, from my vantage B?
Shit is sinking like Atlantis B and I’m more set than Alanis
What, you ain’t understanding me? Am I speaking Spanish B?
Well adios holmes, am I getting sloppy Joe? Well what am I, a Manwich B?
I got a Big Mac if you want a sandwich G

Food and liquor stores rest on every corner
From 45th and State to the last standing Henry Horner
J&J's, Harold's Chicken, good finger lickin'
While they sin, gin, sin sin at Rothschild's and Kenwood Liquors
The winos crooked stagger meets the high stride of the youth
Searchin' for the truth
They rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings
They get, high off that trunk bass and 20/20 rims
They rock braids, Air Force Ones, and Timbs
They drink Hennessy, Hypnotiq, and 40's
They call they women hoes, bust downs, and shorties
They keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full
Prisons packed, bubblin' over in brown sugar
They keep empty, Westside lots crowded, hype's powdered
The well is running dry
The days of Malcolm and Martin have ended
Our hope has descended and off to the side
Waiting for the reinstallment of the revolution
Because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution
But God has another solution, that has evolved from the hood
I present one who turns, the Fiasco to good

A'uzu billahi min ash shaitani r rajimi

Dedicated, to my grandmother
Peace! And much love to you
Yeah! And it start

You know what it is
See.. I got this philosophy right
I think the world and everything in it
Is made up of a mix, of two things
You got your good, y'know, and your bad
You got your food, and your liquor
That's right...Chilly Chill!
You already know, it's a long time comin'
I give you my...I give you my heart

Copper alloy bracelet forms were recognized and used for currency
As transactions from the end of 15th century to the mid 20th century
Their metal content varied from copper to brass
Most Manilla were manufactured in England or France
And like trade beads, were used for trades with Africa
The local chiefs on the slave coast of West Africa traded their human cargo
For many different commodities and the Manilla was one of them
This Manilla was manufactured in Birmingham between 1830 and 1850
Was being shipped to Africa to be bartered for one slave, each Manilla
These slaves were then packed into hulls of ships
And taken to the West Indies and the Americas
To be sold for vast profits if they did not die from the journey
The Duoro was one of the slave ships
With trade goods on her way to Africa to pick up her human cargo

Sounds like Aylan, I love smiling

Matter of fact, can I have one?
Right now, y'all heard the man, lights out
And the moon turns into a disco ball
Heaven, better come and get your daughter
Waltzing all on top of that water
Then Whip, then Nae-Nae, then dip
Down in my submarine
I got a pair of seats
Raise the periscope, to see parakeets
And the dinosaurs don't be scaring me
I got my own personal Dairy Queen
Satisfaction is guaranteed
I'm rather dashing, apparently
Got an airplane too, won't you come fly through the air with me?

Opium to the ceiling
All for the love of plugs, squealing "ugh", healing
No more Timberland turf, you're too soft for this
Award-winning awkwardness you walking off into the office with
In the rims with friends' ends like state trials and Paypals
In nondescript homes in Arizona
In sub-divided neighborhoods, with floors made of solid wood
In roofs of clay tiles sits a couple million dollars
Sin I tried but the old me blew it
Exactly how you knew I'd do it
All my brothers, I would love to paint 'em Jewish
Reinfiltrate the movement and assassinate the music
Exaggerate the ass and face then masturbate to it
The constituency brilliant, but the candidates are stupid
I'm too rude to ask for nudes
But way too ruthless not to pursue it

Maybe, maybe you'll feel me when I

To the poor hands sided in maelstrom's position
Street sales in comparison pale to the Scottsdale bail bonds commission
It's like trappin' out the pawn shop
Gettin' close to the magic like the wrappin' on the wand box
Third layer from the wave

Compose yourself, like a self-aware opera
Conjurer, in the zone like Sonic to
Produce me a sign of the end-times
In time to make profit off the T-shirts
And monetize all the research
And leave Earth feet-first
Breech, behold
Whites get whiter in the cold
And colors don't fade in the bleach, hah
Applause then fall through a man-made south
Talking to a doll at the pancake house
Then bring the lightsaber-ers
So bring the lampshades out, mood
To say something lewd on the news
And move like views on a cruise
And fuse like Q’s into U's
Ah, ooh, ah, ooh

Which side are you on?
Am I getting warmer? Cause I can't hold on
Are you close to me? Sunset so long
And can you call me? Cause I lost my phone

You don't have to go, go, go
We can be alone, alone, together in this

Yeah, uh, yeah
She just walks, and talks to the noise in her heads
Safe in the middle but destroys at the edge
Burns up the nest and poisons the eggs
When the sound hits the ground, the tone seems to beg
For the dark, wanna dart but it's too hard to march
When your heart's nailed down to the "start, on your mark"
Then a spark but she parked, too caught up in the blitz
To risk ripping them apart
So she wanna stay, on a high tonight to survive
The eyes pry wide down the manor
Opening the face to be gouache and awash in the glow
Of the faraway souls of downtown Atlanta
My report, a million similar souls signalling
Hoping to be a synonym for now
Put in a pill again when it drowns, when the night comes 'round
And the sky opens up and the lights come, down

Fluorescent, iridescent

The killing contrived the inner vibe, tried to fill her in size
But didn't survive the attack of other feelings
Cracking at the seals, life-hacking it, backing it
Something real as the key to the ease of the bees in the ceilings
Fauceting all the things down from the dark clouds
The valve house, canals, the foul, the undependents 'til it breaks
The surge, tsunamis down advantages
Knocking down establishments, washing out the catalyst of fate
Weight filling the room, moon, the moon

Identify the atoms united to make it work
Then wreck it, re-order, re-organize and perfect it
Then let it, forget it, then stepping into the method

State of ethics vetted to better his new genetics
Medics, headed where warfare's kinetic
The square's self aware and dares to self edit

Front of they frontline, out the plane
With no parachutes in they backpacks
Choppin' weed then droppin' seeds
Then flowers grow where they land at

Suicide, it’s a suicide

And the abusers fuel the dull losers
To make fools of the schools and pool Bueller's
The crusade to legislate oxygen
And put it in a box just like Desiree Washington
Fortune cookie, First Panda accelerated profit
And hope Santa fill my socks with highly-decorated moccasins
My, how the roles have reversed
So now we gotta eat 'em for dessert
Bop the kids just to free 'em from the curse
Dress up the thots in lingerie and feed 'em to Levert (uh-huh)

Beauty is the largest
Organize the objects
Diaspora and sonnets
Community resistance in progress

Uhh, I exist, spoken in a confident voice
Can world shift and continent hoist
Look under for the plunder
A rich man's song that gets sung for a sum out the lungs of a stunner
But life turns to a station and a hustler to a hummer
Went from speaking and now not even sinking
The game is karaoke ’til it tries to punish poke me
Kinda throw me words slowly, fade degrading in the foley
Waving metal sheets make thunder
Fooling I was younger; fool me when I'm older
Fool me now, screw me down to the sofa, taking Soma
Drinking soda, eating vulture, tweeting vulgar
Playing Madden getting fat and getting cultured with the quotes
In the hopes people will get the jokes
If it rains you will get the float
But only if they're still building boats

But your values system says you believe in sleep
More than you believe in grinding
Your values system says you are a consumer and not a producer
That you’re spending more money than you're making
Why? Because you're a consumer, you're reading all the books
And you're saying everything the books are saying
But those books are not in alignment with your values!
And you're gonna go to the next level
Your values are gonna have to change

Uhh, Drunken Fist versus Praying Mantis
Was it God's plan or man mismanaged to turn New Orleans to Atlantis?
They lie in the streets to lambast
The black land swam at like a HE MAN in a bathtub
Fire! Cup up the bad blood
Hope hand tugs come right after the lackluster backrubs
Or half structured or tech hubs or wack love
That's stacked as if chance in community chest
God said, "Don’t you ruin me yet
Until I give them everything and there’s just two of these left"
Black bumper slow fades into a vista
Rapid cuts a stock footage which freezes on a listener
Give me love, lovers
I read it like blood color on the head of a flooded structure
Can't keep the duck rubber under, fundamentally it’s buoyant
It rises like court rooms to swoon for your enjoyment

Every single word you said
Will you say it to me?
Well it stays with me
I heard every single word you said
Will you say it to me?
Well it stays with me, hoohh
Trap music meets trapezoids, fake his own death
They roll rocks like asteroids to the crest
Think outside the box, I wrap a toy in a cheque
Then watch a sissy fuss with a boy in a dress
Mad at the world, in a voice of a man
With a bag of a girl, she just avoids the success
It's what he said, or what she said
Double entendre no matter how you play it
Then he takes the sex tape and destroys the cassette
And puts the ribbon in the sky like the limited of eye
Then prepares to utter, what's been a symbol in its side
Against the ticker tape scene in a Silver Lake dream
Sorta orders the lungs to unmilitate screams
Shouts to a forged son with imitate beams
In a blue sky filled with pornographic strings
Getting caught up in the trees, I still believe in Jesus!

Our purpose is to ensure
That literature and art sit well
Into the whole revolutionary machine
As a component part
That they operate as powerful weapons
For uniting and educating the people
And for attacking and destroying the enemy
And that they help the people fight the enemy
With one heart and one mind
Every single word you said
Will you say it to me?
Well it stays with me
I heard every single word you said
Will you say it to me?
Well it stays with me

There was a man who wrote many things
But Carlyle said, um, that we could not be ruined
Because no lie could live forever
William Cullen Bryan said, "Truth crushed to earth, would rise again"
And James Russell Lowell, made it more plain
That we would not be ruined or destroyed
Because he said that, "Truth, forever on the scaffold, lies forever on the throne
But that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch, above his own"
These powerful scriptures were also used by the man
In whom we celebrate his birthday today, Dr. Martin Luther King
And Dr. King told us to practice non-violence and the power of love
Non-violence and the power of love has brought us thus far
The agape love that we have for ourselves
That we have for our people is the reason why our people
In this particular diaspora called, North America
Have not been totally ruined
We have not been totally destroyed, we have not been exterminated
So therefore, uh, my dear brother, um, Wasalu
We call you, we thank you for what you've asked me to do
And we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under God
Workman that needn’t not be ashamed
Rightly this dividing the word of truth
And so at this time, in this city
Where young men's lives are not worth much
In this city where our people have been discriminated against
And kept from the resources which we
Rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city
We are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world
That I call Elohim Jehova
And we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling
To keep us from being ruined, to keep us from being exterminated
And we thank the Almighty
For the privilege of being here with my niece
Is to impart these words
And I hope it would be of assistance in this project
God bless you and thank you4Embed

Gladly, didn't always have that cake but I always had a patty
Or at least a home girl like Aesha from Cincinnati
Word to Ken and Kathy, who says that we can’t be happy?
Sadly that it ain’t no joke on that block, like Laffy Taffy
Tried to trap me, dug out like a nappy snappy, even Lassie
Attacked me, tag me for grapplin' so I can get back to wrasslin’
For the love because the foundation is my heart, that's my start
Play my part, make communications with my art

Not like Yokozuna in booty pants, on Hoover, I do the Dam
Or at least I'm tryin', in the hopes that I see some diamonds
On a boat and a piece of mind and on a coast with a decent climate
Where dopes wanna seek refinement
And the pros wanna keep it client
And the cults wanna see my rhymin'
For the dose of the secret science (yeah)
Wade through the maze on the way
To the stage at the pace of "Amazing Grace" (okay)
And a raisin raised in the rays of the Sun
Wouldn't fade in the shade of the day (okay)
Will you lay in a cage with a snake
Gettin' flailed on the back and it nailed to the palm?
Not the nails from salons but the nails that attack
And a rusty razor blade to the face
To clear your sins? Nah
They don't want that fate, no
They won't take that place, yeah

That's ying-yang, that's Baby Boy and Ving Rhames
That's the best of both worlds like God caused the Big Bang

Keep blacks all around that waste, but don't wanna make us senseis
That's senseless, since slaves, man's like, "I don't wanna work, send slaves
On ships, on waves, in waves", okay
Colder than a goalay, golder than my Rolay
Told her hope and hold her 'lobe just like Evander Holay

Say what you gotta say

You know what I'm sayin'
You know, some niggas really out there bad
You know what I'm sayin'
Some niggas is forced in positions where they gotta do things where they don't wanna do it
You know what I'm sayin'
So some niggas forced to dope, sell dope
Some niggas forced to pimp
You know what I'm sayin'
But you got some niggas out there that
Just lazy, you know what I'm sayin'
Niggas ain't forced to do nothin'
Niggas got other options they just choose not to do 'em, you know?

Sittin' in the back of the police car position
Your mission is forgetting and denying the existence
Thinking of different ways to keep from submitting
And continuing to not to mention
...like that
Grand Marquis Police Interceptor edition
With the wall so you can barely fit in
Knees is touching the front seat, shifting
Cause your handcuffs is cutting your wrist and
Your wishing that he would drive faster pleeease
But he slows through the hood as he drives past the free
It's cool but you tripping:
The quicker you get there
The quicker you sit there
Cuffed to a bench and
They playing good cop, bad cop
One of the them pretending
So you rewind yourself
To your uneasy recline in the back of the police car
Hand-cuffed and the seat belt
Nah, you ain't gotta quicken the pace
That just give me more time to sit and erase
Alibi and alias, switch and replace
Think about then, forget about an escape
Thank God that I'm up in the states
'Cos if I was in Russia who knows how they'd do a hustler
Wait, I ain't a hustler, I'm straight
I'm damn near a buster, no laws I break
Money I never seen, guns I didn't hold
Drugs I never sold, calls I didn't make
Nigga this is a waste of your time and mine
"Is that uncomfortable?"...."I'm fine"
A case? This ain't even a fine
You ain't find nothing, homie, not even a dime
Not even a dime that'll drop dime on me
I know you was dying so you put a dime on me
I know that's a crime, you supposed to fight crime for me
Protect and to serve
Prosecute, correct and return to the homies
And thats gonna send them direct to the curb
So you can put 'em back on me

Even if they didn't
He's sitting in court lying
Testifying against defendants

And he love to choke niggas
He don't trip with the rich
He just like the broke niggas
Probably did more dirt in the street than most niggas
Even the old people don't like him
'Cos of the way he approach niggas
Nigga, you ain't no better than me
Just a hustler with a badge
Confiscate the dope money
Put it with your retirement boat money
You ain't building no playgrounds
In the poor for some cash
That ain't a pension
That's a shoe box stash
With a Glock to protect it
We both undercover, check it
Thinking that the good we do
Gon' out weigh the sinning that we do to collect it
Saying "it's for the community"
They don't value us
Only around because the property value up
And they gotta clean the street before they put the houses up
Knock them Section 8's down
Put them 200,000's up
Feel he don't get paid enough
To kick in doors, to raid and cuff
So he use what niggas get on the street
To supplement the wages cut
So he gotta keep just enough niggas out there hustling
To keep his paper up
...Like that
Maybe he should be in the handcuffs

I'm fearless, now hear this, I'm earless
And I'm peerless, that means I'm eyeless
Which means I'm tearless, which means my iris
Resides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded
But I'ma find it, I can feel its nearness
But I'ma veer, so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer, but I remember
I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness
The windshield is menstrual, the whole grill is roadkill
So trill and so sincere, yeah, I'm both them there
Took both pills when the bloke in the trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as Rosie, pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace

And I'm mouthless, which means I'm soundless
Now as far as the hearing, I've found it
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear
Of a stewardess in a Lear, she's fine and she's flying
I feel I'm flying by 'em, cause my mind's on cloud nine
And in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the Underground King
Who's also Klingon, to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon
Or lion in the desert
I'm flying on Pegasus, you're flying on a pheasant
Writer of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers
Spit, "hot fiya" like Dylan on Chappelle's skit
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn
Don't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn
Sleep?

I'll tell you what you should do (Dumb it down!)

And I'm brainless, which means I'm headless
Like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplay-less sex is, which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang the chain with
Which makes me necklace-less, like a necklace theft
And I ain't used my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the best-fed F-F jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues; my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseidon, Westside beside 'em
Chest-high and rising, almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make ya fly with
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine, make it rain
You make a boat, I make a plane
Then, I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again

Fitted hat is Reynolds Wrap cause I don't trust the government
See, I'm not just touching it, I'm clutching it with oven mitts
Shit get hot, this wristwatch, looks like its a club in it
Like the way I emcee, man, they just be lovin' it
Used to be a pushover, now I'm into shovin' shit
You be on your glory hole, you don't know who you fuckin' with
Stay off in that story mode, I never like a quick game
Came in with a big blast, go out with a big bang
You might catch some whiplash every time I switch lanes
See, I drive a bit fast, nigga kinda insane
Career on stilts, Braveheart: no kilt
You can hear it screaming "freedom" as the beat get killed
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat (Uh-huh)
Don't you hear it screamin'?
This that Joaquin Phoenix, nigga, this that Joaquin Phoenix
This that Joaquin Phoenix, nigga, this that Joaquin Phoenix

On that Joaquin Phoenix, nigga, this that Joaquin Phoenix

I'm not a Turtle, I'm a turbo
Haters pray to god that I turn slow
Like I'm sipping on purple
But I ain't on your glow
I'm in a whole 'nother circle
Trying to keep it clean like church clothes
Said that respect was something had to work for
But that ain't gonna work though
Get your respect, but lose all my worth, no
You can dead that, get a hearse, go
Don't need 48 you'll find a killer in the first floor
It was me boy, to commercials
Feeling out of place like PETA at a fur store
So I left with a couple dozen fur coats
Said I could never break away from your hold
Watch me, turn though
Said that I blew it like Turquoise
Just mad hear it all in your word choice
Know it hurts but I really don't care though
Let me rub it in, get it all up in that ho

I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna, don't wanna right now (I don't wanna care right now)

I don't wanna, don't wanna right now (No I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't, no I really don't care now)

You're no lights, you're an undercover car
I'm an ambulance, and a fire truck, and some strobe lights, tied up!
Shining all in your eyes, all out of yours and all into mine
Lights and stars is all intertwined
And I'm feeling like Malcolm looking all out the blinds
Any means any means, and you can do anything anything
And the flow tight, skinny jeans skinny jeans
Hit you like Pacquiao, Philippines Philippines

I feel inclined to invite y'all
In the mind I'm feelin' real spiffy
Signed sealed illest label deal in the city
Check me and my fifty dollar fifty-nine fifty
Buyin' diamonds is just no longer in me
So no more chains flooded watches on the right hand
I work like a Mexican spend like a White man
That's right man
I could Bentley afford
Instead I copped a couple skateboards
And some sneakers
My kick game is crazy
Keep a French eyeglass, a backstage pass and a model for a lady
Charlie stop whinin' I got a bottle you babies
Don't get gassed up on what you pomp-pomps think
Cause the heart still dark as Mont Blanc ink
But the real OG'S told me fall on back
You got a Secret Service now you call on that
If that ain't real, man, I fall on tacks
I'm feelin' real good
I think I might post in here
And hold the Westside down like it's a coast
This year
Bishop G, they told me I should come down cousin
But I flatly refuse
I ain't dumb down nothin'
Like BOW
Lovin' the Chi right now
Comm Sense the priest

Crucial still the king
Kato, rest in peace
And for those that ain't never met I
I own 1st and 15th
I'm Lupe the Jedi
Jay don't mind me I'm just blowin' my zone up
Doin' it bout as fly as a maggot grown up
And still got a life that's backing the poems up
Just give me a foldin' chair I ain't after the
Throne but
Got a broken lamp flow that nobody ain't touch
Just sayin if FnF ain't up

Pictures I painted on the walls where we hang
From the trees we hung
Strange fruit man look at how we swung
How the hell you gonna tell a son
Who ain't have a father
How to try to grow up and be one

You always had my love, and now you got a song

And you ain't gotta have a man if you don't ever want
Cause I'm gonna make sure you got two of everything
That you ever want, every tone, like your very own
Not to make you hard to respect
Just really really really really hard to impress

He'll never put you places where you don't belong
Put you through the pain, to put you on the throne

Yeah, I need you to sing that single again
Play that video I seen you up in
A hundred million spins in my mind all day

There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here
Forever
There's only two ways out
Of here
One's through the door
The other's through me

Ugh, sometimes, living in a world like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain
Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend 'til the end that you don't fear change
Don't admit that your faith is weak
Don't say that you feel like dying
Life's hard, and it feels like diamonds
Your home's just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Can't understand what I'm saying?
Can't figure out what I'm implying?
If you feel you don't wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
I'm on the dark side
And you can't come find him
How, when it's light all around you?
Yeah, but it's dark all inside him
No winners when it's me against me
One of us just ain't gonna survive

You must be a radio station
And who are we, we must be
A number one song, spinnin' all day long
And over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win when we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

We interrupt this broadcast
To bring you this special message about the forecast
The future's cloudy and it's raining on the poor class
Road to peace is closed, heavy traffic on the war paths
Love is balling on a budget
The military's says it's gon' need more cash
To keep fighting for your gas, keep us in our hoods
And hope we never explore past, stay inside of your half
Believe the lies you learn in your class
That there's no treasure in your trash
And a Sealy has the same feeling as the floor has
And that's where you should stay; this is what they play
You might also like
Over again and over again
And over again and over again

And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

You're now tuned into the weakest
Frequency of fear, keep you locked right here
And hope you never leave this, never be a leader
Think inside the box, and follow all procedures
Never ever believe that, you will never need this
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this
Hi you're on the air, now what you want to hear
Well we ain't got the truth but how about a remix
Different is never good, good is only what we pick
You ain't got a hit, unless it sounds like these did
Not too smart, you will be a superstar
And if you dumb it some, maybe you could be number one
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

So beware what's on the airwaves
And be more aware of what's not gettin' airplay
Independent spirit, you can barely hear what they're sayin'
Truth ain't getting on like shampoo on an airplane
Propaganda's everywhere, constantly on replay
All the hits, all the time, back-to-back on relay
We're really where it lives, make them hear the records we play
Build your own station, become your own DJs

You must be a radio station
And who are we, we must be
A number one song, spinnin' all day long
And you put me on daily rotation
You're on the air, we know you're scared
But we don't care, we'll play this here
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the warships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my old self I wonder if we still see alike
We was tight seeing lights, speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high, life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted, trying to fall asleep, lost inside my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down

I'm begging me don't let me go, we vow like the letter "O"
To never go our separate ways and spin-off into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin', playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits, livin' off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow, can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room the entry wound, let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is, unprepared and filterless
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers, shootin' out of you and me
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Sometimes I feel like the world—
Sometimes I feel like the world
Is against me
And everything that I've done before
I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
But when I put down my gun
I turn around and pick up one
This Uzi weighs a ton
But I think I'm done
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

Simplified love-sick, taking no prisoners
Sunny day, cold heart, listen up listeners
Dark side love affair out of time and in the rush
You can't hold it until the sun rise settin up
Let's levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes
Everything you're hiding
I can see the truth in you
Even when you're lying, even through the darkness
I can see you shining

When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you

Blood, By, Sun, Light (Blood, By, Sun)

A played out love song playing in the background
Seems to describe every part of where were at now
Every feeling that we ever had for each other
Every karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered
Now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin' but some trouble
Now some couple trouble makers making mayhem on the double
Tryna figure out the meaning and break apart the puzzles
Why they love you when I hate you when they hate the way I love you, solar

Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all
I could be hustlin' bags, strugglin' bad
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all

I could be thankin' the Academy
A friend of the family, your man deliverin' bail
Or I could be the man that delivers your mail
Or I could be takin' the stand, trickin' on L
This could be my third life, on my third strike
On my third wife, or garbage on my first mic
I could've got off easy, that nigga deserved life
Or the Orkin man, searchin' for termites
I could be stickin' up convenience stores
Or twistin' up what you fiendin' for
Gettin' buck with the meanest whores that been givin' up
On top of a buildin', leanin' forward, with no wings to soar with
They could've kidnapped my daughters
Been extorted for a couple of Porsches
I might be drunk from the Mo', stumblin' slow
Someone to know, runnin' the show, or shovelin' snow, shit

Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all

I could be startin', guardin', or plantin' a garden, or security guardin'
Or I could be starvin' and eatin' out your garbage
And found stardom starrin' in sitcoms with Martin
I could've been marchin' with Martin
Handcuffed, North Face over the face with no comment
I might not even be dark-skinned
I might not even be conscious, comatose from a overdose
A R&B singer blowin' the notes
A tailor sewin' a coat, a sailor rowin' a boat
I could've boxed a little, fought for the title
Lost and lost my vitals on the way to the hospital
I could've lost my business
Won the lotto and lost my ticket
I could be the last one to cross the finish, shit
I could be you, I could be him
You could be me, we all got a job to do
Shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all
I could be hustlin' bags, strugglin' bad
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all

When your spirit is strained
And you limited to change
The lyrics in your limericks'll change
A different hook, the way the sentences arranged
More demented in your deliverance, more sinister in your slang
Sounds more belligerent when it's sang
The truth is limitless in its range
If you drop a 'T' and look at it in reverse it can hurt
Look at the grimaces of the pain
And it's worse when it works and your membership is gained
But you forgetting the proof diminishes in the flames
Like 'poof', the media pours images in your brain
Of the score of the war where militants is slain
The faces of the guilty where innocence is proclaimed
And they filthy, the deaf ears are the winners
The listeners are the lames
Of the ballad of the man that the son of a minister has became
So

Wherefore does my glory go?
Wherefore does my glory go? (Glory, glory)
Wherefore does my glory go?(Wherefore does my glory go?)
Wherefore does my glory go? (Glory, glory)

But you gotta understand, our differences is the same
What starts in clouded minds, finishes in the reign
Of the fools that are used as instruments in the game
Where oppression is the queen and ignorance is the king
Where revolution is dead, no candles in its memory
No remembrance of its fame, just a mystery
No mentioning the history of the chain, the enemy
No hennessy sentiments in its name
Just an unmarked grave that menaces have defamed
With the propaganda, and images of the gangs
A lost art, no apprentices in it trained
And they brainwashed, no interest in its stain
And the minds weary, all the adrenaline in it drained
While the wrecking ball is, disassembling things
Her highness is the cause, his eminence is the blame
The pride is still there, the privileges still remain, but


And you've gotta respect the position in which you playing
Never let your heart reflect the conditions in which its staying
Even if it's dark, and the temperature is the same
As winters in the Ukraine, your appendages is in chains
Have forgiveness from the start, keep maliciousness restrained
Be smart, never indiscriminate in your aim
'Cos there's innocent witnesses oblivious to the things
That come, the one's the hypnotists keep entertained
And you can't arc, have some resilience in your frame
Stay resistant, and committed to what you sing, 'cos
They'll flip it the minute that you refrain
Read the book and the lines, and literature in between
You gotta be educated when going against the grain
Pay attention, they illegitimate in their claims
They assisted in the killing and pillaging
In addition to the addiction
Shit is much bigger than just them planes, but

Wherefore does my glory go?
(Is it on TV? Yeah)
Wherefore does my glory go?
(Maybe it's on a CD?)
Wherefore does my glory go?
(Do you see it when you look at me?)2Embed
We here homie
Voo doo master, Lupe Fiasco

Welcome back, an invisible storm
We've opened up the show put criminals on
Opened up the stool let em spit a few songs
Shut down the jewels put his tennis shoes on
Took off his students put his principles on
Don't believe my hype put the interviews on
They don't believe me right you was interviewed wrong
I'm believe you like a hype I'll put my chemicals on
If your such a G why the limiting ya'll
If you can say that's me then why the intervenin on
See my whole crew is ? on
Just the word of me 1st & 15 on
For the past year had to get my lean on
Stay away from the streets I was glittering on
Only bread was where heralds? put my chicken wings on
I was centipede short, but now I'm limousine long

Knew that I was hot but I wasn't cool enough
So I said I had to sit on the sill some more
And from the blocks where I made the raw
Broke down the raps and waged the war
I waited in the water and layed the law
I almost didn't make it man I braved it all
When niggas couldn't take it man I shake it off
Wore my hat where you couldn't break it off
Got a respect for the set, I would take it off
And walk down the same block from shit that you get chased off
And that's gangsta ya'll

Lupe and his crew done came up while you was sleepin
FNF goin up, FNF goin up
They hate but they study and watch you they can't see em

Been seated at the power meetings, yeah! I know how it feels in there
See its one thing to be put on
It's another thing to own
Niggas don't feel that there, na
Niggas is A.C. and I'm ocean breeze
Homie do you feel that air? where
I'm from West Madison
Fans across the world that's where that begun
With this flow that was wack to some

Haile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving
Poseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving
I'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast

"Throughout history, it has been the inaction of those who could have acted
The indifference of those who should have known better
The silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most
This, has made it possible for evil to triumph."
- Selassie, uhh

Man's limitation, transfiguration
Haka dance done at the welcome to the demo
Modern man comes to the weddin' in the limo
Mixin' doves with the rice rain
Uncle Ben's off the rails on the night train
And that storm took us to the platform, pushas
Back to the bachelor's backdoor, unhook us
Hope this track take you back to where the fat girl pushed us
And that's very old
Like Blackberry Bold but the juice
Sweeter than where the party at, or
Releasing these niggas from the roofs, and
Leavin' these niggas on the loose, or
Keepin' these niggas in the coops, and
Leavin' these niggas on the noose, free!
Shamu fan got a world to see!

Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned
That until there no longer first class and second class citizens of any nation
Until the color of a man's skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes."

To the limit, the limit in the Methadone clinic
Ridin' with the pack like a Peloton
Flyin' with the sack in the trap like the pregnant
As it breaks in the backs from the cracks that we step upon
If I triple my worth, will it cripple my mom?
If I simple my search, will it mental my calm?
Will it hurt if I give you my palm?
To tell in it, don't put a nail in it
How you gonna see the world if you a whale in it
And readin' my palms like there's braille in it (braille in it)
Is it the trail or the forest? (forest)
Or the forest with the trail in it?
That's a sail with a 12 in it
Water coming through from impalin' it (water come through for me now)
Nothin' left of the boat but my holes
Still I fill up the world and I float like Haile
Haile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving
Poseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving
I'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float
Brand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast

"A qualified man with vision, unmoved by daily selfish interests
Led to right decisions by his conscience
In general, a man who knows from whence he comes
And where he's going will cooperate with his fellow human beings
He will not be satisfied with merely doing his ordinary duties
But will inspire others by his good example
You are being watched by the nation
And you should realize, that you will satisfy it if you do good
But on the contrary, you do evil
It will lose its hope and confidence in you."

Hydrant open wide, on the side of the colonized
Swimmin' in the street, fell asleep on my mama thighs
Blockin' out the noise that destroys little boys
Live enjoy, ships ahoy, get deployed by the rock-a-byes

Lyin' fall asleep at the feet of my queen
Hawk, I'ma write to the beat of your wings
Psalm for the Ethiopian King, Haile

It's the way of the stage
It's like a stereo sun
It's the way I build up, the business really gets done
It's like a stereo sun

I hear it: the spirit, and I don't fear it
Matter 'fact, I steer it
Right in the heart of the hardships, I don't veer it
And this car is just a metaphor for my experience
No registration or insurance, just a license to ill
God's hands on the wheel, and my pedal's to the ceilin', peelin'
Speeding like 24 frames through the lights
With the traffic cameras filmin, brights
So I could see the brilliance of this life I've been given
Livin' to start a revolution every minute
Driven to win it, no breaks, no pittin'
Pole position ya soul, keep ya windows tinted
So we can see out it, but they can't see in it
So this here's ours, and them theirs rented
Cars moving at top gear, Jeremy Clarkson
I feel like this my first track and I ain't even start nothin, yessir!

The best thing ever, you should really come and hear it
But if you can't, cool. We'll be coming to your nearest, soon
Shining like two suns, it's better than two thumbs
The whole plot's to get you
To stop from doing what you do, to do better than you've done
Then we'll stare down the feds in the room
Who dares not to scare? Hear it, boom!
Unaffected by your werewolves, ghosts and your 'boom'
The tour through the tombs don't do nothing to 'em, never!
I turn the pressure into treasure
My problem's in the present and my presence is forever
Yes, sir!

Man, look what I bought here, look who I taught here
Look how I fought here for what I sought here
For everywhere I go, though, they be throwing salt there
But it's cool though—I'ma keep it cool, Joe
I'm as cool as Cujo—now look at my shoes, Joe (Yuh)
Now look at these shoes, yo—you can't find that
'Less you flying to Singapore, homie, you ain't buying that
All I'm tryna do is bring that time back
It Was Written, man—bring those rhymes back
Life After Death, homie—bring those lines back
Malcolm X II tryin' to bring that shine back
It's my thing, I spit it like Sean King
It's more than just rhyming—I'm doin' 'bout nine things (Woo)
The aforementioned executive board-sitting
Representing the world-famous, Grammy Award-winnin'
(F and F?) That's right, homie, Grammy Award winnin'
Could have been put it in your face, but that's the poor in 'em
See, what I gotta front for? Who I gotta front for?
Everythin' you doin', homie, is over and done for (Yeah)
But you can catch Lu chilling in his one-offs
If y'all don't know what that means, homie, then you don't understand that's mean, homie
That means, homie, these jeans on me the only pair ever sewing-machined, homie (Woo)
Yeah, I'm just showing you mean, homie, like a dictionary
Listen clearly to the clean homie (Woo)
And this ain't fair—I'm barely on my lean, homie
Or put my all into it, like a washing machine, homie
Double-loader: You just watching me clean, homie
Wait til' I start doing dirt—
Oops, I spilled some First and Fifteenth on me

Push by the time that you get off (five)
And I pump 8's till I reach lunch break (twelve)
It's bout the time that you get home (that's six)
That's the gist homes
That's the unofficial master plan
Minus any unforeseen traffic jams
Like my songs carrying the clubs like Bagger Vance
Or getting' caught by them long arms
Like Mr. Fantastic damn
But I can't fade like Fantastic Sams and taper off
I'm a better nigga man this is Edward Scissorhands with my back against the wall
Till I'm a V12 6er I'm a 130-round clipper
As if I was Elton Brand
But I could never leave Chicago
Unless heavily cargo, my jeans heavily argo
My stride is stiff see I rides as if
I don't need a helpin' hand, uh
Pride is this, never you see I is content
I'm slick I slde, I don't slip I ride
Don't flip I grind when the shit hits the fan
Like a line drive into the stands
The shoe fits the foot the mitt fits the hand
Misfits hollow tips hits ya man
Swallow nicks when dicks hit the land like
Snoop Dogg in his wheelchair
But I'm comin' from the Chi
And I flip pies
3 14-inch rims and they runnin' on the side
West that is, yes, F to the I (West Side) throw it up
Now back to the pies
Wasn't talking 'bout Snoop Dogg's wheels there
I am Farrahkahn with the Heroin
Salvatore Ferragamo on my feet
Pair of charms 'round my neck
Skeleton Vacheron on my arm
Gangsta, runnin the streets like marathon
With 26 Ks now lemme break it down I'm the leader of the pack
That's hard to believe if you fatiguin' in the back
I'm back to the master plan
I'm up front with the Africans
They swallow birds like Sylvester

Sí, now you can still die from that

Agreed, a Mead notebook and a Bic that click when it's pushed
And a wack ass beat
That's a track that's weak that he got last week
'Cause everybody in the stu' was like, "That's that heat!"
A bass-heavy medley with a sample from the '70s
With a screwed-up hook that went "Stack that cheese!"
Somethin', somethin', somethin', "Stack that cheese!"
Mother, sister, cousin, "Stack that cheese!"
He couldn't think of nothin', "Stack that cheese!"
He turns down the beat, writer's block impedes
Crying from the next room, a baby in need
Of some Pampers and some food and a place to sleep
That, plus a black Cadillac on D's

And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

So, what are you going to stand for?
Dreads in the sky, I and I, 2 new Vans on a land four
Take that back, make that 2 new shoes on the van floor
Me and my band out on that road
On a never-back-down-from-my-stance tour
Yeah, touch more souls than a dance floor
While they touch less floors than a hand or
Ceiling fan or - wait, let me tell ya slower
Lift my fans up to the ceiling and you'll never touch the floor
Woah, now if Noah need a rower
I'll be there with my oar till we get back to the shore
Dad made me a soldier, GI Joe to these Cobras
Tryna FBI my Panther, CIA my Sankofa
Infiltrate my Carter, illuminate my culture
While they watching through that buckle, but I stay up on my hustle
Turn that belt back on they self, now I watch them scream for help
Like Africa need aid, or black women as maids
Uncover undercovers turn those maids to Bubba's mothers
Take the hero out the Nino, keep it real as trouble-trouble, huh?
Or maybe cartoon Martin on The Boondocks
Flip the script on chicks who think their shit smells like perfume shops
Help them girls find beauty without a magazine or movie
She Delilah with them .45s or Keisha with that Uzi
Now I know that's contradiction, wants and needs in competition
But it's hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition
While we waiting on that compromise, proceed with that conscious eye
New gang alert: hashtag occupies
Repper 'til the death of me, FnF, what's left of me
All my hate is for the fake recipes for wrestling
Only time I wrestle's when I'm wrestling with settling
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything
I know that that don't mix like ecstasy and ketamine
Funny how I'm only sick if you never catch a thing
Argue with your friends over what really the record means
Back and forth about its course, with professors refereeing
Why he so rebellious? Up-front with his realness?
They wanna be fiascoes, reproduce his failures
Emperor is his alias, but not Marcus Aurelius
This is more like Sparta: kick you down a well, kid
And on my last check, I copped the NSX, just like Pharrell did
Well did, better doings to come
My only promise is I'll never ruin the young
I'll never human the sung lyrics in a spirit that's
Superhuman to some, keep you pursuing the sum of
Slums, plus, get up out of them, plus, never forget
Just where you from, plus, make sure that you're ballin'
When you come back up in them, plus, we don't die, multiply
Every single come-up,  parum-pa-pum-pum, yup

Album on hold, whole world on hold

Man, now ain't that cold
I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie that's up in the hole
And homegirl not tryin' to be a ho, even though she on a pole
Can she get a second chance? No
Whoa, like the opposite of go
That ain't how it's supposed to be or butterfly
But for the sake of rhyming, let's just say butterfly-ee
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali
I tell 'em, tell 'em, don't homicide me
I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
Fightin' for his fans and fightin' for his folks
But the boos from the crowd can become so loud
If I can block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and
Dance around the ring but until then I'll sing

I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be

"Tell me about your mother, what she's all about"
Prescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce
Damn, jeez
The world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skis
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees
Rendered unconscious, they rushed me to a concert

They fed me magazine covers and video shoots

"Huh?" said a young boy in the mirror
A young version of me, so I started to tear up
He said "You need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up
You're already here, just be yourself from here up"
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar
Somethin' I was taught, somethin' I had lost
If you are afraid or fear that you gon' change some
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from

I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there

Like justice I'm just too influenced not to do this to it
This one dedicated to the soldiers
Throw up peace signs in the face of bulldozers
Never bow down or wrap their body in explosives
As long as your alive, fight your whole lifetime
The Horn of Africa needs you
Calling out to all you friends of the people
Be the change that you wanna see
Tell em no change just ain't what it gonna be


Yeah, the people, united, will never be defeated
And on the People's Mic this forever be repeated
Whose streets, our streets, it'll never be deleted
No matter how many cops that you send to try and beat it
This is revolution in the making
A ragtag movement set to takeover the nation
Now isn't that fun
You just wanna make the world better, isn't that young
Well, blessings to the youth then

Yield, to the forces of darkness
I bring you the torches of our shit
Reinforced with hardness of Wolverine's
Arms with the harshness and overall sharpness
Now how far do the arms get?
My nigga, from the stars to the starfish
From the baby to the Bar Mitz
It's a whole lot of light and a whole lot of arm length
My arms long, but I'm lawless
A strong arm, I can lift up all this
You gon' have to build a bigger farm fence
To keep them wolves out of Old MacDonald barn, bitch
Yeah, Team Jacob
We're long armed, put my hands on a lear
Everytime I put my hands in the air
Watch the throne as I dance in the chair
Throw my crown in the crowd, hope it lands on the heir
The weak niggas like to pass interfere
Spit a lot of meh over jams of the year
That act like the man up in here
That don't count when your only real fan is a mirror
That's subliminal to any nigga that he feel he is too
But you don't stand a chance, playa
I am there, Chi-Town, fan of the Bears
Love where they dance in the square

Radio is making our craft weak
Forced to repeat the same dumb shit that work
Only as hot as your last beat
And rappers, they relating to that last piece
Album never leave they desk if you don't got no B.D.S
Sacrifice your publishin', they said you really need a hook
And they ain't gon' pay you, said that you received a look
And what's stupid real, is what producers feel
Twenty placements or you stuck in that producer deal
And R&B chicks so get it the wildest
All they money goes to hairdressers and stylists
Gotta keep up with that image
Label lose they mind if they ever see a blemish
ProActiv and peels, airbrushers and trainers
Managers suggest you fuck a nigga to be famous, huh
But it's all entertainment

We have to stop wars, we have to stop this war
And we have to get out the habit of war
It's more than a habit, it's an addiction
We have to get out of thinking that we must be a military superpower
We must get out of thinking that we must have military bases, as we have in a hundred countries
Is it possible that having military bases in a hundred countries arouses a lot of antagonism?
Is it possible that it promotes terrorism when your soldiers and your sailors are all over the world, occupying this country and that? Is it possible?
Why do we have to be a military superpower?
Why can't we be a humanitarian superpower?
Instead of sending planes for bombs
Why don't we send planes for food and medicine?
Oh shit, it's one of the machines
Looks like it's trapped under something, it's broken or something

Let's get out here -- we cannot stay

Hold on lemme get my keyboard, I can re-program this thing

It doesn't matter. Leave it!
No seriously, I can do it -- just give me a second!
Reprogramming unsuccessful

Enemy -- I kill people
I swear to God, man, I can do this! I can do this!
Cross your fingers
You have to work!
All right, this is the last time
Reprogramming successful

Looking like a Pharaoh in the flesh

I'm super cold

I'm super-cold, my freezer deep
My cooler closed: air-conditioned seats
I don't trust them niggas, they conviction weak
They be thawing out, my commitment keeps
Twelve months, hope that well jumps
Seems like selling souls, is havin' sales bumps
I be in to win while your sales slump
Your chances getting slim, mine on their 12th brunch
And they smell lunch: Hercules Klump
Throw my weight around
Ain't left the scale once
Always bear in mind: even with your white fur
We still polar opposites: you ice picks to icebergs
I'm colder than Universal Soldier
Angel on my back everywhere I'm at
Niggas don't believe it just when I lay it down
And when I get back up and see my angel on the ground..

Really?
This is what you guys been doing?
Seriously?
Before daybreak there were none
And as it broke there was one
From moon to sun, it goes on and on
The winter battle was won
The summer children were born
And so the story goes on and on
Come on woman in your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are green
From here to eternity
Become a woman in your own time
Far, far, far from the virgin vine
Rise on out from the dead leaves
Come back to me
Oh, she sings her favorite song
Left with tears and dreams, it goes and then on

Standing in line for the new one
Not the black, but the blue one
And I don't even know what it do, son
But Steve Jobs said that it's too fun
Fun in abundance what I need
It's cold out here, put my arms in the sleeves
I'll probably lose my place if I leave
But I really need to pee
If I do it right here they'll see
Makes you wonder, how do snipers
Marathon bikers
Next time: diapers
They say it has all new features
Faster processors and much better speakers
Great for kids, a necessity for teachers
For work or home
A revolutionary way of being alone
I mean, should we really get a loan?
Hey what's the matter, just tell it to your phone
Cupertino heart with Chinese parts
Built by the poor, but designed by the smart
They opening the door so you go
On your mark, get ready, set, buy
Imagine a world where everything starts with an ‘i’
But it still ends with a die

They sent me to a section ‘bout used guns
New runs, nuns'll scream, moms with jeans
Match their teens' jeans and genies who try to chew gum
Aw man, it's so confusin’
Confusion in abundance what I have
Good thing that God accept cash
Maybe buy my way up out His wrath
Skeptically, why am I way up off this path?
Atheism's cheaper, and accepts Visa
My thoughts as I'm queuing up for sneakers
Won't discriminate – I’m getting all eight
In every color that they make
Beaverton hearts with Chinese parts
Built by the poor and designed by the smart
On your mark, get set, cop ‘em!
Imagine a life that revolves around shoppin’
Conspicuous consumption
That means it serves no other function
But to show off to someone, or others
Who only try to show off to you – look at your fellow loyal customers
Isn't harmony great?
Look at all these friends that marketing makes
How many fries can these arteries take?
I'll give McDonald's a little help here
I think they should expand into healthcare
And then you'll have all ends covered
Even make caskets, have it all umbrella'd
Can you make the corporation fear me?
"Couldn't hear your order, can you speak less clearly?"
That which was put in the ground
Will someday come back around
From dust to dust it goes on and on

She said love is a hard thing
Somewhere between golfing and gardening
Or parole board pardoning
But she was still down for a hard swing
Flowers she would pick like guitar strings
For a real good whiff
Of how life behind par seems
Until then she a bar-teend
And pour hot lead shots out of carbines
If an inmate ever even think about departing
Before it's time for the theft of a hard thing
Wanna see what a bum riding BART dreams
Before he get gunned down, cause some sharp scene
Saw it all on the way to the art scene
Around the time they kicked us out, they had the park cleaned
She ain't living in a car she just RV-ing
Life on ice like the San Jose Shark team
Hard times, tryna duck em like Darkwing
Known for burning clothes and petty car-keying
And other less harmful skylarking
Bought a bag out of American Rag
A small Chinese-made American flag
Took a dollar bill then split it in half
The picture that she bought wouldn't fit in the cab
On the train trying her best not to live in the past
A bum probably asked could he spit in her ass
And that was it, fits, tantrums random
Helter-Skelter, a world gone Manson

Unimpressed by poems or the moonlight

Tuned right out of that school life
Soon as reality became a camera crew and a boom mic
So what do you do like?
She said "Absurd last words from a dude off a Zoosk site"
And then left him
Like the Roots left Geffen

New bras to put her chest in

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

Wishes that the world could see
From the position of my girl and me
From the perspective of laying on the hood of a car
Looking up at the stars with all the connections cut
Cause when you stuck, advantages vanishes
Bandages on the damages of what depression does
Sequestered cause, who are they to question us?
Beating up our ear drums like Question Love
With all of their requests from above
Press from below, only directions to bus
Thus we laying in the cut on the Cutlass Supreme
Looking up at the scene
Hoping it doesn’t cut, the fresh and the make up
Get re-fed the lines and reminded of what they mean
The importance of really acting like they important
And if you don’t feel ‘em you should force ‘em
Now...

Wishes that mend the broken heart
Fill the open palm, pardon my flow and thoughts
My departure from the norm, to parts that's more warm
War torn from the marchin' of your armies and the droppin' of your bombs
The walking on the waters now stomping on the pond
The ripples now a wave
It can’t be peaceful with a pistol in your face
You can’t beat the people so you picking on they place
I jump to defend, I wage with a page
My pen’s mightier than them and I got missiles on the stage
This couch is for the cowards and stretchers for the brave
And I happily lay upon the bed that I have made
Like house keep, sheets and pillow case
But I don’t sleep, dreams is keeping me awake
They went up thinking they would never touch the ground
But we gon wish it ‘pon ‘em on the way back down

I love the Lord
But sometimes, it's like that I love me more
I love the peace, and I love the war
I love the seas, and I love the shore
No love for no beach; baby, that's law
But she doesn't see, therefore I spoil
I trick, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness, status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene, an obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king, together
She would make me cool, and we would both rule, forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
And if the rain stops, and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high, and if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom to him
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell, and I'll be

And so began our reign
The Trinity: Her and I, Caine
No weatherman could ever stand when her and I came
Hella hard; umbrella, whatever, put plywood over Pella panes
And pray to God that the flood subside
'Cause you gon' need a sub 'til he does reply
And not one of Jared's, you think it's all arid
And everyt'ing's irie, another supply
That means another July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger—Felix
'Cause he is the cleanest amongst the
Younger outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and well-to-do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fighting in class, who might not pass
Rap record-pressured to laugh at a life not fast
"Can you feel it?" That's what I got asked
"Do I love her?" Said, "I don't know"
Streets got my heart, game got my soul
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul
Quote to a crying, dishonored baby mama
Who's the mama to a daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes
And a necklace with a solid gold key like the starter of a car
The opener of a door, or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby, but what about lately?
Then ha-ha-ha-ha-ha'd, right up in her face, G
There's more fish in the sea, I'm on my mission to be, be

Come, these are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
And seek unholy grails like a fool
And hang with the players of the pool
Fast-talking on the hustle
No Heaven up above you, no Hell underneath ye
And no one will receive thee
So shed no tear when we're not here
And keep your faith as we chase
The Cool

You're so smart, you're like, a contemporary museum of art
That farts, that's harsh, narcissism, on narcotics
On sharp objects in large pockets
At dark, you ain't gotta hide it, keep it, "Metal Gear Solid"
Lead the leaders, that's how you file it, then clobber it
Low on energy, find peach cobbler then gobble it, yeah
It's food in them drums and boxes
If you beat 'em up then they'll drop it
And they'll rapidly flicker till they disappear
Blinking gradually quickens 'til they isn't here
And that's da da da da da da da da da da...
Just to be back in, reincarnated, exact twin
Exact ten, exact twelve
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba (Exact self)
Do I really gotta say it? Didn't we all play it?
Dojo, Abobo, over shoulder throw, polo

Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby

Unless you Bamm Bamm
Knocking them pitches into the grand stands
In the club, watching the women just do them handstands

We're all chemicals, vitamins, and minerals
And vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living
And cherry-picking every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HurL
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips?
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks?
And smells like shotguns and deer piss?
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay ain't playing that the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weathermen
Or maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not “rain” like “Rain Man” or rain like “rain dance”
Or rain like a “slight chance of rain” when it's rainin’
Or “rein” like deer slaves to Santa Claus; sleigh man
But “reign” like queens that reign over made man
And not “Queen” like “Queen Killer; Rhapsody Bohem’” Queen
But “queen” like white-glove-wave-hand
And not “wave hand,” like it's a heat
Wave, so you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking “wave,” like you saying, "Hey, man!"
And not hay for horses or "hoarsest" like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor, but now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drop, and the sun dies when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapse, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
'Cause he want what we got, like yeah
You might also like
Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer of sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
Or more torturing, a water-boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside of Apple prison
Chicken hackin’ download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerd storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buckaroo roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who’s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero, Gaiden, hiding, Raiden in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging Rain and catching hail
Faith seers need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real Steel til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!

You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

With a platinum plaque, it's like Robbin, George, and Jack
The mind fears what the blinds hide but I'm here on the blind side
Hanging up 'til the line dies then off the hook for the crimes tried
Get awful looks from tribe tribe, unlawful jux when you climb skies
That's Robin Hood, arrows of the rich'll steal
In Hollywood and featherweight, I step by step, let it escalate
'Til you get it, will tell you if I hit it
We can make pie if we don't fidget
Xzibit, Pimp My Ride exquisite
We G's coach us back if we die in business, my Lord is my chemist
My sword is from Khemet, Egyptian fonts and ankhs

Where the golden means, so the overseer gets overseen
And the over here's are the older things
Can see the bell but don't know the rings
The rings are not sounds, but circles, wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel, 'til it's all universal
And it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size
And it's dynamic in the high standard
So each degree has a part to price
See big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity
And little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity

The applause of patrons at the laws in nature
Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
That's bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
Under-Christian, it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half
You look just like how I'ma be

The King
When you’re king of African music you’re the King
Because music is the king of all professions
(N.U. Music)

Best laid plan, make a mess, made
Damnation, let's play hands, sans spades
That's without, a boycott and a sit-out
Afro-Black pick in with a fist out
From the "Welcome Home" to the kick out
Reach into a rabbit, pull a trick out
Preacher preaching to a faggot with his dick out
Hard times call for armed time, hmm
Sick, sick, sick eyes from the nose pressure
Police snip zip ties on the protesters
Six wives in the fry of a molester
Met him at a caviar bar out in Odessa
Dirty needles breaking all the old records
A hundred hoes, one shovel and some old treasure
Ole Zeke use teeth as a gold tester
Finger rolls, finger waves, closet full of old leathers
Old sweaters, old boots, that's a whole suit for some cold weather
New sale, two L's and some old letters
Now he doing double life, while she lead a double life
Man, he need another wife
New approach might help a nigga bowl better
New hoes might help a nigga hold together
Or will the new lane lead 'em to the same pen?
And the hunger strike in 'em to the same tin

Getting slammed from the protest, no food
Force fed him like OB with a nose tube
Visions say consult the yogi with the gold shoes
With the Rollie going bowling for the old school
(Yeah) I need more for the Michaels
That's a loss for the class and a score for the rifles
Three hots and a cot and some cops
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible
It's all quiet in the jailhouse
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out
They was looking for the swords
They was looking for the swords
I'm just looking at they feet 'cause I'm looking for the Lord
Looking in the library, looking at the law
10 years deep, now I'm looking at the bar
Claim sovereignty 'cause I'm bunkin' with the Moors
They degenerate, they ain't looking at the game
They just looking at the scores, they be putting on my books
'Cause I'm looking at the stars, trade a shank for some crank
Now I'm looking at a war, BGF got the yard
AB got the kitchen, snitches on PC
M&M on a mission but C.O.'s got the prison

Punching on the glass
Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid, wasn't gon' take away the visits
Segregate niggas by theyself and make 'em stay with it
Wicked, swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT team
That's a cop team
They sent hella cops to stop, the helicopteriiiing...
Man, he'd thought that he'd fly away
Like a kite, take flight, like a letter on a string
Like propellers on a wing (but the kite was the key)
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals, no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel outta A Block
And wear gloves for the razor-wired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone, rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay! That's how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When you're rehabilitated so correctly
And let's hope that's how you're living when you're set free

The orange wings of the new Jim Crow
Are dyed Klansman sheets and court papers
Dreadlocks nooses hang from his neck as the new Jim Crow
Corporations feed him seeds yet unborn
He’ll be captured by Maya in a ruby-encrusted cage
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And answers that I leave in empty pages to be written
Where is your pen? The new Jim Crow

You could look like us, you know shit get through
You should be in cuffs like us, you should get strike two
You should get like life, you should get like woo!

Over your own soul, so control
Your own remote control that your folks can hold

Never left like soundin' like the hole, right?

In the prison stripping niggas phone rights
Got a malice, on the other side of the bars
Watching niggas get smart, watching niggas get strong
Watching niggas get home, he jail us
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down, he tell us
With each beatdown, he help us
Wrong one gon' knock his ass out though
It's why he gotta lock all the niggas out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound?
It's why they treat niggas like shit

Takes another nigga to turn me

Currency soaked in the blood of my father

Cherubs and cerebellum
Terror at Sarah's wedding, Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand (OOOH!)
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't, well then you're wicked
Such is life, odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals, vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And today's mathematics for beloved
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers

But barbaric are still the prices

To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me?
Or was it slippin' like permission? Am I trippin' like field
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth

Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear
The hell that we raised
To the heavens make symmetries for
Our petite mort, our petite mort
So glad you're back
But not glad at that you're glatt
Where is the glamour in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds?
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The atelier slowly fills with baboons
And other monkey business
Where killers go free cause the junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter
How are your chains?
Do they make you behave?
Keep you over here, by your overseer
Fallen from grace
Down from Heaven to memories' floor

But let’s get outta that, before it’s injuries
At first I had patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting my time, my time, my time

"If you had to paint the gutter, which color would you choose?"
Said the patron to the painter, the painter said, "The blues"
"Do you act off intuition or languish and peruse?"
"More like tap into tradition from the angle of my mood"
He looked back at his canvas while strangling a tube
A master of the palette, all sanguine and cool
The music mostly jazz, the jazz mostly old
Punctured by some punk and some old smoky soul
An atlas on the trunk from the land of broken goals
Just a cover and a back that you open and you close
"Where are all the pages?" The paintеr said, defanged
"I ripped 'еm all out and made some paper planes
Fish grease absorbers and some origami cranes”
Poured hisself a drink and then poured it down the drain
Looked at the empty canvas, said "I think I have a name
I'll call it 'Gasoline Pouring on the Flames,'" hah, hah


"I appreciate the visit, this isn't normally allowed"
"Do you consider yourself wild or conforming to a style?"
The patron pointed at a pile, "Are those rejections or mistakes?"
The painter said, "That is not for question or debate
Most of what we know as art is the projection of a faith
The product of a Pontiff or the election of a saint
A gift from the read for the digestion of the can't
A visual garnish for the confessions of the frank
Displays of physical carnage make connections to the ranks
Goes over very well with South Americans and Yanks
Not to sound shamanistic, but there's medicine in paint
It gets kinetic if you let it, there's a fetish in its strength
Martyrdom will call, Russian roulette is in the flanks
And most would pull the trigger if the weapon's full of blanks
But when there's a pool of sharks and you step into the tank
That's the pool of art that got 'em headed to the plank
But they fell for the deceptiveness of the secularist's complaint
The upheaval of the cathedral into the edifice of bank
That pile over there is just the evidence of angst
The failed revival of a perfectionist when his efforts have just sank
A selection of the waste that lacks direction or a base
You lose all of the plots for the affections of a race
Man does not become superior 'cause you connect him to a cape
Nor does become inferior because you connect him to a ape
I never wanted my life to be a collection of some dates
And holiday my days away and intellectually sedate
It's not really a beef but conceptually it's steak
Like do genitals and gender roles successfully conflate?
The current art world is just competitively opaque
It never ceases to amaze, my mouth is medically agape
One day its raising up the brand, the next it's shredding it to flakes
And the velocity of trends is what referees the pace
Professionally accept what ethically I hate
So in all of my work, you see this wrestling with fate
Deceiving in the brushstrokes how aggressively I strafe
Less like putting on some makeup, more like severing a face"
"Wow," said the patron with a smile
"That's the most interesting diatribe I've heard in a while
How you articulated the nature and put it all on trial
Took it up to Heaven, then put it on the ground"
The painter asked the patron, "Can you stand up on the pile?
I've had a flash of inspiration, my creativeness aroused"
The model took its place, the painter grabbed a lighter
Doused the shit in gasoline and set it all on fire

I get my energy from my inner G
I be in outer space but I got inner peace
So tell my enemies that they can't injure me
I know that irritates, you have my sympathies
Well you should protest, yeah you should picket me
I'm on a losing strike, I'm on a winning streak
I'm out in left field, I'm speaking mentally
But that's a better place than where the benches be
I'm feeling really good, me and my different beat
Me and my different drummer; he play the timpanis
See that's what got me here, you hearing me
Me on my "black man in the future" shit, call me Billy Dee

I'm in the drivers seat, but you can ride along
It's never cyclops, it's never I alone
I'm telling your story wherever I perform
Now if they looking for me, you tell 'em I've gone

Great American Rap, resurrect...
Rest in peace, Young F
'Porting live from the set
Uh
'Porting live from the set, yeah!

First off, say "Peace" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile, suicide bombers
And prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils
They got to, just to stay awake
On the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels, and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism, and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine-stripper mad dash
A friend request, follow, and a hashtag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
'Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillac

'Porting live from the other side, what you hear?
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way

And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
'Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death
Live from the other side, what you see?

'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way

An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central, an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for "Thriller"
But the U.S. Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege, vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the mid-ler
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…
Live from the other side, what you see?
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
'Porting live from the other side, what you hear?

Yeah, yeah (Woo!)
Ugh, alright, yeah, alright
Ugh!

Fresh to def she is
From her steps to her set she is
So death might not let me live, ya dig?
Fresh, uh-huh—yes, she is
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind, don't play like this, naw
But I'm prepared for it, got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs, even cut my hair for it
'Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for light like that, then there go it
Yeah, right over there, so I prepared to pour it
Little scared, my stare lowered, momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already out of my chair
Gather up my Airs on my square from here forward
It's nothing, right
So here go it, whispered in her ear
It's kinda crowded in here, would she care to blow it
And she said, "Yeah"

You're my sunshine
(You’re my sunshine)
You're my moonlight
(You’re my moonlight)
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight
You might also like
Never met her before
But I think I like her, like a metaphor—it's hard to get
In the car we sit, from the intro
She rolled down the window, just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm, a little more confident
Uh-huh, and then we lose consciousness
She says that I've been waiting for you
And I know you've been chasing me too
Since they kidnapped me from a castle, I've been thinking of you
I told a fire-breathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes, you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said, "See? Too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine"

You're my sunshine
(You’re my sunshine)
You're my moonlight
(You’re my moonlight)
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight
Relationship is just thirty minutes long
It's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong
Gonna take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two, before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me; out of the trillions
Of numbers that's in the world, just leave me a few
That lead to you
Won't be long then, I'll see you in the morning
Cool?

You're my sunshine
(You’re my sunshine)
You're my moonlight
(You’re my moonlight)
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me

I'mma just go... And then we'll figure it out from there
They say form follows function
And if you just function properly things will form themselves
Yeah, that's kind of what it is
So on that note... America's most

First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin' around my temple
Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
And they sink in the same sea that we walk
Not that we Jesus, we just don't wait until it thaws
But you can hold my hand like applause, pause
With no homophobia involved
Now if I would've said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
That would've been the call, but naw
You can't see in ours, but we can see in yours
You can't see in ours cause ours is Kingdom Hall
Yeah, just like that, we just let it roll, you know?
Yeah, and check it, check it

So when that pond thaws and it's no longer Gretzky
That's when we jetski
I gotta catch up to myself, I kind of left me
Are the windows still blocked up? Let's see
Maybe see something we couldn't view before
Been in the stu all day cooking food for thought
Now out the soup du jour for you and yours
Might find sushi for your soul, we call that moving raw
Lions won't cross the line, cougars won't move a paw
Chickens won't cross the road, dogs won't roof at all
Always had flow, just added a front door, roof, and walls
Hotter than the fire that into which Koopa falls
But that's only if you super, dawg
Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
You can never really tell just who's the fraud
Truth might still be alive like true and false
That's why I never really trust unless it's Lu endorsed
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced
Now that's three mis, like you warming up your vocal chords
Add a fourth if your vocals hoarse
Like Mister Ed
Get out of pocket have a horse's head in your bed
Now that's what I call a good night's rest
You might also likeYou know? You know, just plays like that
When you just let it flow
When you sit back and just let it go, you know?

And now my vocals warm
Add a fifth and a sixth now I'm ready to perform
The Buddhist said that I am not reformed
If I ever be reborn I keep coming back as me
Well don't forget the other five as we
Weave the most wanted Angelina Jolies
And Morgan Frees
Send it around the room like we smoking trees
But it's no purple in the circle then there ain't no rolling b's
Just spoken words, thought provoking reeds
Hydro, I'm still strolling on the seeds
Eye low, like the lotion from the leaves
And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E. Cheese
All without touching weed
But I'm still hungry and I'm having lunch for three
This is my form, now what the function be

And art what I draw
And ooh, what I say like Imogen Heap
Good night niggas, go to sleep
You know? It's like form follows function
And if you function properly then
The form will come out of it
And whatever it is, it
It just be what it is, you know?7Embed
Yeah, I say, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five, maybe four
Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along, and this what she says
"Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!
Somethin' that's far above average."
And maybe other rhyming words like "cabbage" and "savage"
And "baby carriage" and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama, comma
And because she's relatin' to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Uh, tell 'em, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
They misunderstood
They misunderstood

Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through 12
On the Internet watching videos, listening to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
"Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches."
Now, let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens: high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Disclaimer: this rhymer, Lupe, is not using "bitch" as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection
‘Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sho' enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house, hot mess like that
Ass, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
"Bad" mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But "bad" mean bad to him, "bitch" don't play a part
But "bitch" still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch – what a double entendre!
Tell 'em, bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
You're misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, greatest motherhood

It's a mad world out here, I tell you
The world's gone stark, raving mad
Everyone in the world is mad
It's a mad crazy world

I see diamond-flooded demons

Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
Listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
Shun him while in public disallow him from your stores
Have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
But we must still pray that his color will be cured

With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
He looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
From the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims
To do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
You torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame
Blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name
Perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane
Knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change

Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
Put his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
Now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time
With no life inside his body now he finally think he’s safe
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
Doesn’t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again

Drill music, pop that pill music, kill music
Desecrating the temples in the ghetto
Funeral processionals increase their frequency
Because we can't break the spell of Geppetto
No one knows
And scrolls of obituaries contain more words than dictionaries
That will define how lions in Zion became alley cats
Who traded their baseball bats for gats that spat
Blood of the people across steeples
And concrete jungles that turn playgrounds into graveyards
That buriеd generations of Black and Brown men who lеft their post
Because they were misguided by ghosts in the land of the living
Ready, aim, fire
Wanna be the block, but can't buy the block, bulldozin' the block
Makin' the Red Sea choke on bones of drones
Sent by PPP loans to see how you spent the money
Left, left, right, left
To figure it out while the ancestors watch and aid those who call out to them
Through altars, pay phones, saxophones, bottles of liquor, glasses of water
The sum of a son and a daughter equals new life, the holy trinity
He was a baby boy, but he was kin to me
Born to Basimah in hands of the lion who said
"Store your water in the basement, because one day, it will be scarce and polluted"
He said, "One day, grocery stores will be baren
Learn how to grow your own food and don't get caught starin'
Down the barrel of a gun
Learn how to run underground drills in Zion"
To be reborn lest you be scorned by the ways of the wicked
Who pillage our communities and natural resources for profit
He said, "My children, each of you are prophets"
Don't let money be the sum of your deeds
Pull the weeds from your mind
Look to the front, the side, and behind
You each have blades that will drill a new earth
Manifest the new world that Columbus thought he found
Band together to reverse the weather to unite the seeds of the oppressed
Stand together and work righteously to be blessed
For generations to come
Drill down, Zion is in youYou might also likeEmbed

Assassin's Creed, rapping it back indeed
Like a mansion that's lacking fees, tapping the blackest keys

Mistaking the sanitation for sanity

Egyptian museum, they keep the kings in crates
Thrones out on loan and they keep their rings in safes

Never bite the hands that feed
But when those same hands grab the gats and up the sleeves
They gather traps and apparatus for your grief
They catch you lackin', wrap around yo' hatch and squeeze
I swear my hands werе pure, I gave 'em manicurеs
Became my adversaries, became my saboteurs
I put karats on them just like rabbit lures
My middle finger's like, "Fuck this nigga", what happened to us?
Used to be clappin' for us, thumbs up and then snappin' poets
Now they be dappin' fo's and grabbin' Moet
And they know that I don't drink
At least I don't think
I asked for peace signs, they gave me Leon Spinks
I asked for "Okays", I got, "Up yours" and "Go aways"
Shoo gestures and throat slicers, the motion's made

Hey, you looking over there
I got something to show you if you got the time to spare
The quality's the highest and the price is very fair
It's honestly the nicest thing that I have ever shared
You look like the type that likes a diamond in his ear
To walk around the town and be so shiny and revered
Come across his boss and be so timely and prepared
Look like a million dollars off of signing with the Bears
I don't mean to be so deeply inside of your affairs
But if I likеd getting ripped off, then I'd bе over there
But that's why I'm over here, with that you should beware
I'm only saying this because I really, really care

I think it's more a temple, not a stall
But, no, not a religion, not at all
I know it's kind of simple and it's small
But that's 'cause it's the middle of the mall
If you wanna show off and just ball
Or your intention is the drawers
We got credentials for it all
Welcome to the middle of the mall

You ain't got a budget for these nuggets
You can keep it Plain Jane or blow out they brains when you in public
The matching ring, chain gon' look insane when you untuck it
They'll never know the difference, even if you let 'em touch it
Now if you are a rapper or a trapper on the job
It don't really matter if you get jacked or you get robbed
You can go on, let 'em have it, it's not a factor or a prob'
Only thing that's gonna happen, you gon' get attacked by all the blogs
But to regular people you gon' be sharp
And you gon' be so attractive on the block
Now, it might make you a magnet for the cops
But please don't let them haters try and drag you from the top

You ain't gotta be a criminal involved

This is where the finishers evolve
In the middle of the malls

Diamonds only worth what you are willing to pay
A deceptive game you are killing to play
Now I have diamonds, it's odd feeling this way
But when they start to sparkle that star-glittering glaze
It sways, takes your mind off todays
Where preachers can praise AIDS as God killing the gays
What a fucking phrase, never ceases to amaze
But when he dies from cancer, that's God's mysterious ways
Jesus saves African sold slaves
Gabriel's in Afghanistan passing out AKs
It's a rage
The diamond sometimes are suedes while putting 'em to the blade
I have hesitations
There, I've put it all on the table, I have my reservations
Besides, we'll find something else useless to put our faith in
You won't finish this here, we'll pick up after meditation, uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
It seems you've got the spirit of the appalled

Nice, we look alike, they want a slice of your dreams
Even Christ took a knife for the team, so swing
Yo, fatal flying guillotine, uh, yeah

I just come around to help like Batman utility belt
All by myself with the world on my delts
We can chill while it melts, the beat bill feel like it's felt
My suspicion Christians killed all the Celts
What else? What elsе? Forget what happened in thе past
You gotta let it go like what happened to the gas
Can't have such anathema inside a mass
It'll ruin your communion and soil all of your fast
Stay away from rebels worshipping the devil like jazz
When Heaven loses a job, Hell wins staff
Looking over macroeconomic math
Counting, weighting, and calculating how much time that we have
Then put it all in a graph, look at all of the paths
But look at Instagram then go back and split it in half
I ain't rapping, what's happened is blowing glass
Trakk is tapping drums and Crystal's blowing the brass
Per the usual
All that beautiful musical moving you like a inter-cooled Subaru
With an Italian man saying, "Look at what I do for you"
A nice Chicken Vesuvio

Now there are those that resoluted to wreck
Got caught, fought, lost, electrocuted to death
Came a little late for the rescue and the flesh
DNA exonerates posthumously whatever's left
No resurrection but reputation's correct
The revelation brings decorated regrets
All due respect, it's not really about fair
Collective sigh 'cause the real killer's still out there
Probably calling up police
Complaining 'bout his neighbours or just walking on the beach
Why should he have such views of the ocean?
And not be hanging from the gallows with his neck neatly broken?
I let it soak in, then I put the soap in
Then I put the boats in, then I play with both them
The hot tub's now lookin' like a yacht club
Makin' sure I get all of the shoes like a bot does
Neighbor is pissed
Tells the cops "if he wants to bathe like a sailor
Live on a container ship"
I party all night and the bangin' is intense

Life is a sine wave, Einstein mind in this time-space
When they try to keep, you gotta climb gates
Escape from a city that's defined by crime rate
Design traits that minimize the grind

Find breaks, gaps to recline safe
Resign a sign and rewind tapes
Get your line straight, recite it all right

If done right, you'll be unliked, but you'll be unlike
When you gotta run where snares on the drum type
Where they hung whites, psych
Where they hung blacks
Even hung like a black life is a batch, don't come twice
You could light a fire with a thumb swipe but you need a lighter
If you got the motion, but none of the components

Facts, I wish that they was lying in they raps
How does that transpire
To be so damned by God, you want your friends to be goddamned liars?
All we talk about are our goddamned priors
Shiny metal boxes on top of goddamned tires

Also want it to be real 'cause Heaven sounds like it's turnt
Wear my conscience like a condom 'cause I don't wanna be burnt
Wear my dharma like its armor 'cause I don't wanna return

Sometimes I hide inside Kerouac for protection
From the Thanksgiving where bears attacking the dressing
Like Tekken, just lean back and tear into that refreshment
Sometimes real life parallaxes in depression

Maybe not die, maybe just kill (Wait, no)

Black power, I'm just runnin' with a barrel full of black powder
With a hole in it holdin' it wheezin' deep, breathin'
Runnin' from the fire on the trail I keep leavin'
I can't shake it, I swear it's heat seekin', I keep seekin'
Somewhere to hide from it, duck and dive from it
But it keep keepin' up, just when I think that I've done it
It keep sneakin' up, oh, leakin' barrel of black powder
How that flame keep reachin' us?
Just one of the long-winded, extended metaphors of Lu's
This time I use an example of a fuse to demonstrate
How I can't lose, I would put it down
But I can't due to the glue that I use to fuse

And goddamn, I might have to carry this forever
Well I'm crazy to the game till they bury me insane

Of Chicago, liked his hat to the left side
Wasn't in a gang but he was prone to bang
Doin' his thang, doin' his thang

You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel way beyond outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that

I got my eyes on like the fire zone
Let's be bygones
Won't you come and be a line in one of my songs?
Maybe a whole verse, baby the whole Earth’s my home
So let me show you around the crib
Tell you what I do, and show you what I did
Flow is on the stove, I'm cooking for the kids
Wrist is in the freezer, heart is in the fridge
But we can warm it up, plug the Foreman up
Open the oven door, turn the saunas up
Stretch the Benz out, if it ain't long enough
Get lost in the feeling, be no longer us
Hop up out the coupe, hop up on the bus
Give you 'get to the backs', code name for Rosa's sons
We're in a better place, give us condolences
This like a player's mate, and like a coma love

You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel way beyond outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that
You might also like
And I hope it's all up to your standards
Cause babies really need to be pampered
I'm behind these tents like a camper
Cause you're out there shining like chandler
Like a chandelier standing near in your radiance
I think we all need some shadiness
Or some vision care, oh no, you didn't dare
While I sitting here like Huey in his wicker chair
You know that isn't fair, how you just entered here
Getting their hopes up, that they can interfere
You're so insincere, you know I got you
Have you looked in the mirror? You know that's not cool

You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel way beyond outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that

Let's have a cease fire, be some peace tryers
Let's negotiate, because my cheeks tired
From smiling all day
Emotions need a motrin, a tylenol break
I know you see my strategy, if flattery's a battery
Then I'm a rabbit with a pack of 'D's in back of me
Pause on all levels, everybody settle
I know it sounded weird, I'm just trying to impress you
And step forward with my best two
If all that fails, hope it’s swag to the rescue
I said swag, and I'm sorry
Don't mean to offend your sensibilities I meant dress smartly
Just trying to get you out this party
Can you dig that? Ologist-Archae
Please be the Ferrari to my car key
And I'mma hold my baby down like a car seat
You know what you're doing to me
You got that firepower, baby
I just can't get enough
No, I can't get enough

You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel way beyond outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that4Embed
If you are what you say you are (Yeah, yeah)
A superstar (Gon' say now)
Then have no fear, the camera's here (Uh)
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh (The return)
If you are what you say you are
A superstar (Uh-huh)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here (Yeah)
And the lights are on (Ha)
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah (Free Chilly)

Yeah, uh, a fresh, cool, young Lu'
Tryna cash his microphone check, two-one-two
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees; "What have you brung? You?
Did you improve on a design? Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You—the more famous person—you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too!"
And then it hit me, standing outside of heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
"Go back, whatever you did, you undo."
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me two tons too

The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pew!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Uh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, "You need to go and see that!"
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, "Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha"
"Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha"
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you are what you say you are
A superstar (Superstar)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)

Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners
Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty
Be it Englewood or Egypt, Bedstuy or Baghdad
Syria or Liberia, the west bank or the west side of Chicago
Where food and liquor stores still occupy the block
While police and community watchmen justify why they shot
Emmit Till and Malice Green, Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin
Better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton
Or whatever they sellin’ in your food desert
Cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed
On the Fox evening news while we sing the blues
The New Jim Crow caged bird sings
Cause he’s tired of occupying his misery and of our marching
He wanna fly to a higher consciousness
But his school on academic probation
They gave him medicine, diagnosed him with a felony and mental retardation
So he refuses to cease the firin’, nobody’s hirin’
In Illinois, 67 is the new age when you retirin’
Class lines have blurred, those who used to have, have not
Pensions bein’ snatched
Those who never have keep their hands stretched
Social services being cut
Sterilization clinics giving out pills to numb the womb
Young girls referring to their vaginas as tombs
Thinkin’ protests are temporary and trendy
Well rock a t-shirt and carry a poster
And two weeks later it’s back to normal
But they say times are changin’
The revolution is becoming second nature, causes are combining
People carrying torches, hope burning from their hands
Attaching explosive devices ‘cause they keep stealing their lands
In the name of freedom
Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners4Embed

Now I can't pledge allegiance to your flag
'Cause I can't find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto, and then, you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs
I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab, corruption is the swinger
Sitting high, riding dirty, drag racing into danger
And it's so clean, pine trees smelling good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
And as it all falls down in tatters on the floor
I shed tears, I don't know what really matters anymore
'Cause I don't know what really matters anymore
Man, it ain't mean
The strangest thing you've ever seen
Oh, would you look at how they swing?
Would you look at how they swing?
They ain't dead, though
No, I didn't die y'all

Now, as I wander through the city going mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doing bad
Then the separation from the truth is getting vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money
Delighted by the dummying down of the importance of crowns we'll never have
That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river, get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be living off your sad
Hating on your happiness, you hit 'em off with laughs
Smile 'til they surrender, then you kill 'em off with glad
Hello, Evil—I'm back!
Man, it ain't mean
The strangest thing you've ever seen
Oh, would you look at how they swing
Would you look at how they swing?

Hey shawty, ain’t no future in no gang bang
And ain’t no manhood in no bang bang
Ain’t no honor cleaning interstates inside a chain gang
Know some rap niggas put that shit inside your mainframe
Pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing
'Raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain
Get yourself a Camry, "nigga said a Camry?"
Watch that hoe depreciate and then you’ll understand me
It’s called being fiscally responsible
Don’t let these lying images up in hip-hop here conquer you
The TV’s not your father, fool, that video’s not your mama

See I flew so way up high
And I SCUBA'd way down low
Put the top down on my fears
Put the roof up on my woes
I dropped that food and liquor to put you up on my stove
They shoplifted and stole
That just let me know they know
That was Lupe #1 now this version #4
And I still feel like a virgin me versus the globe
From the surface to the core
I took on the biggest wave
And I surfed it to the shore with no pomade in my fro
Took the wood from the slave ships and furnished my abode
That boat is now my bed, desk, dressers and my drawers
Now that's a house of pain!
Plus I use nooses when I hang up all my clothes
Couldn't change up if I chose
That's me

At my brother's Janazah
Tears stained sunglassses
A Salat with no bows
Pallbearer carry you to the car now
Chilly day, Mosque on 96 and 3rd
New York City way, me and Jay never left my side
Rest like that picture with your pride
Who look just like..
Now the city looks less bright
Brooklyn looking less special
Don't carry the same weight
As when you were on this level
You: work in progress from 40 projects, God bless
An inspiration and a king
They won't know what I mean but this one 'bout to spring
Protect it with every feather on the wings
So even when it hurts, you'll never feel a thing

Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...
You might also like
Let me clarify the chorus
And what my cold war is
Cause the complexity is enormous
Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
To reinforce every single word that I talk with
Something about losing things, human beings
That reduces things to their most elementary
Find yourself where you never meant to be
With the energy of memories
That's the soul force of what's behind killing me
Finding pleasure in the pains
Like finding desert in the rain
Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic
Question if I'm over it
Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless
Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit
Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
Still happy that I opened it

Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...
In the studio writing these words, one after another
In memorial of my brother
As you listen to the album with
Nothing on the cover
I imagine that he hovers
Right in the back of this chair
Floating right there in the air
Nodding his head to the music, I slightly lose it
Ask why do I put myself through this
Crack a smile, look up at the file
The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean
But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross
Happy with his dedicated song
But now he's all gone
But he was never there, cause
He was everywhere, nowhere and down here
Maybe on that judgement day, rise up
We'll both open our eyes up, climb up
Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies
Wipes away our cool young histories

Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...
Ride around, you know what I'm saying
All over the world right? I mean, everywhere
I mean we just disappear and just come back
I feel like we can just put him anywhere
He'd find his way back home, y'know'm saying
Another random thing's that consequence to me
But maybe to you, not much
But with that said, the reason behind me
Why I do what I does, love
Just riding around bumping that, uh
Either Jay or Nas, or me
He used to tell em like "yeah you alright"
But you ain't fucking with my man
It was always like that, so
Drop a little for you, let it bump
This that Esco music, it's that Esco music
Bumping with my Esco music, that raw
See you on the other side, As-Salamu Alaykum11Embed
This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth
With land on the horizon and passion in their eyes and
What they think are islands are much more in their size and
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them
Supplies slim, morale once so heavily inside them
Now steadily declining
Return is not an option as necessity denies them
With this they choose to dive in
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
Are the children of this land prepared to share in their surviving
A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
Not the material things of kings that could never last forever
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
And so began it here, and for five hundred years
Torture, terror, fear 'til they nearly disappear

Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

Ways and means from the trade of human beings
A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine
And helps the new regime establish and expand
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land
From native caretakers who can barely understand
How can land be owned by another man?
Warns, "One can not steal what was given as a gift;
Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish?"
But the lesson went unheeded, for the sake of what's not needed
You kill but do not eat it
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it
The forests's were cleared, the factories were built
And all mistakes will be repeated
By your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatments
Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement
And in your rush to have the most, from the day you left your boats
You'll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts
This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
They discover ancient cars on even older streets
And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth
They can tell that they were civil, not barbaric in the least
A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade
Everything's so organized. They had to be well behaved
Assumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
Religions kinda complex. Kinda hard to figure out
But this must be the temple
This White House
This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done

Food & Liquor

Yeah, my man said he wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something he could recognize, something he could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real (FNF)
Something that could make her move, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel

Lust, sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything, he crushed
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them, but we hush if it's us

That's why, my momma said she wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something she could be proud of, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not having nothin' real
Real, real, real, real
That they don't know how to act, they don't know how to feel
Feel, feel, feel

Life, ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest, now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good, so God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free, ain't a G, show you right

The game is not to give 'em nothing real
Real, real, real, real
Nothing that they could use, nothing that they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real
Real, real, real, real
So that's all they'll know, that's all that they'll feel
Feel, feel, feel

Struggle, another sign that God love you
'Cause on the low, being poor make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep 'em out of trouble
'Cause being poor also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own I can hit 'em with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can, on the Man up above you
That's why, I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something they could recognize, something they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something that'll make 'em stop, something they can feel
Feel, feel, feel

Yo! FNF are real; really real, yea
You know what it is, woo
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real
Let's go
So real, so real, so real25Embed
Diamonds are forever (yeah)
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
Uh, F&F, yeah
You know what I'm saying
I figure, I feel like I should just
You know, show people other side that weren't aware
You know what I'm saying
They are presently unaware
They don't know about it
You know what I'm saying
You know just show 'em there's an other side to this thing right here
We call it bling

Yeah
Allow me to break down the game
Behind the bracelets, earrings, chains, watches and rings
The bling
The crystal encrusted, princess flooded
Canary studded, blue coloured and blood stained
Yeah, the older brother of the drug game
The giver of fame, the take awayer of lame
The empowerer of the kings that came with claims and disease
To leave where the native peoples were staying
Believe, my engagement ring received
And flossed at the cost of a bonded child miner's pain
Long ago kings used to wear 'em in their armor when they fought other armies
Because it used to scare 'em
If you wasn't rich, couldn't wear 'em
Witches used to marry 'em
They'll shoot you before they share 'em
The gift and the curse, the venom and the serum
Most hated lady's best friend, get murked for a clear one

You know what I'm saying
But, I just want you to see man
You know what I'm saying
Just see man

Uh, Cecil Rhodes sowed war and genocide
Into the countryside just to get his shine on
I fear what De Beers and his peers used to do
Before the world really knew, just to get their mine on
Making paper with slave labor
And hitting little kids with life time bids making them cut and shine stones
Inflating the price and making them look nice
And I wasn't thinking twice when I was putting mine on
About a young shorty in Sierra Leone
Or other conflict countries that people call home
I figured I would never go to Angola
So it never did affect me there, maybe indirectly
That my neck leash was funding a rebellion or a military coup
Started by militias that don't believe in following none of Geneva's rules
I was brushing off the haters, trying to be cool
Didn't have a clue that the rapper was helping the rapers
Raiders of the villagers, pillagers of the schools
Shooters of the innocents, torturers of the witnesses
Burners of the businesses and my bracelet was the fuel
Uh, I ain't pushing an agenda, homie
I'm just pushing the facts, fuck Bush
'Cause there's people doing worse on this earth and they're black
I took it there, yeah, now let me bring it back
We all know on foreign shores that they finance wars
But ask yourself, "Do they finance yours?"
When I first got mine I took them out on tour
Didn't know they lost half the value when I took 'em out the store
Or it was full of moissanites and cubits
But the jeweler knew I was stupid
And that I couldn't prove it
Feeling like I need it because I do music
To impress the groupies and the interviewers
So I didn't appraise it, nor did I loupe it
Even gave them to my girl, thinking I was Cupid
Homies was all hate, hoping they could make me lose it
Creeping through my own hood, knew I had to remove it
I see the Russian Mafia, the Jewish Mobsters
The undercover terrorists and the traps for the hustlers
Homie, it's a wrap for the nonsense rhyming
Props to Kanye, I call it "Conflict Diamonds"
Diamonds are forever (yeah)
You know what I'm saying
I felt like I should just let you all know that
You know what I'm saying
Make you all aware, so many people
Do things to glorify 'em
I felt like it was time for somebody to do somethin'
That would horrify 'em
You know what I'm saying
Bet you never thought that
That 20 karat ring or 20 karat chain or bracelet that you got on
Is fundin' some little war somewhere
Got some little kid murderin' a whole family somewhere
You know what I'm saying
But hey! Just think, now you know
You know what I'm saying
You gotta know to be a hypocrite, baby (haha!)
Hollaback, F&F up! (Forever)

Yoga flame!
Aww

Meditate, on the floor, fold your legs, resonate
Breathing speed, regulate, clear my mind 'til it levitate
Dhalsim, I beat the game, level eight, hella good
Never great 'cause God is great, so, ain’t no goats, ain’t no gates
Fences see the rams ram, lambs let, sheep’s skate
Brace yourself, teeth straight—fix your face, for Pete’s sake
Birthday wordplay, piece of cake, fold the flow with seats for eight
Ororo Munroe, make it rain, not with bills, I make it change
Take that cool shit, make it lame, take that nerd shit, make it bang
Yeah, you heard us—make it bang
Yeah, you heard me: Make it bang
Melt the change and make a ring, take that ring and make a bracelet
Take that bracelet make a chain, look how far my necklace hang
Connect that chain up to a crane, pull the game up by the brains
Could not move it just with brains, so, I had to use some bling
Shouts to Drizzy, shout to Wayne, Yeezy, Jeezy, Ricky, Fifty
Raekwon, Loso, Gucci Mane—I’m not going to drop my name
Sneak that message to the masses: You can call me "Chocolate Rain"
You might think my wallet drained—look how far my pockets hang
That’s cause I got pocket change—my net worth is basketball
They net worth is soccer games—tell them niggas, "Stop it man"
But they cannot stop it, man, so, they forced to watch it drain
They be looking so blue like water when I wash my jeans
King without the whoppers and king without no Pablo and
King and I ain’t got no dreams
Bruce Lee, dishwasher, cleaning out your pots and pans
These niggas ain’t got no staying power
Once I hit them with the powder, then throw 'em in the shower
These niggas slower than some dial-up
I be on my broadband, these niggas still downloading
Lu finished, you still up on YouSendIt, uShare
ZShare, how long you going to be there? Damn
FinallyFast.com for you, fam
Information superhighway—these niggas ain’t got no lane
But you can ride my shoulder, like they pulled you over
I sit in the driver’s seat; you sit on the sofa
I am Patrick Swayze; you are Whoopi Goldberg
'Cause he was a beast in the way that he controlled her
Rest in peace to Patrick; rest in peace to Stacks, kid
Rest in peace to rap—no, rest in peace to wackness
Yeah, nigga, I whacked it
Baby boy with the glasses
He is like a Black, rap Zach Galifianakis
Hangover, game over, nigga, that’s it!
