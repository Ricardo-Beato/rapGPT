21 ContributorsShit Crazy Lyrics
(Twysted Genius, baby)
(What it do, 30?)
Blrrrd
Wop
Huh?
Yeah
Man

Man, this shit crazy (Crazy)
I'm in Miami wit' Gucci, Rolls Royce look like flavors (Like flavors)
This murder shit ain't nothin' to me, whackin' shit on the daily
Lil' bitch say she ain't heard of me (Man, who you?), told the lil' bitch she gave it
Still trappin' up off my flip, wish I could go trap off my pager

I see these niggas hatin', I ain't losin' sleep about it, though (No)
Members creep like TLC, .223 shells out the Jeep (Blrrrd)
No one gon' take care of me the way that I take care of me (Take care of me)
Get booked in from security ('Curity), your bodyguard ain't scarin' me (No)
Put your friend in therapy, you know I did it, barely live (Grrra)
Askin' me, "Take care of it," I squash it if I pay the bill (Pay the bill)
I don't play detective games, they play, no, I don't play with them (Play with them)
I don't free-pick niggas, when I beef, or show no favoritism (No favoritism)
Lil' boy still need training wheels, these army guns, not baby pistols (Baby pistols)
All these folks and babies in my house, I'm like a babysitter (A babysitter)
Gucci Mane and shiesty twins, we bait 'em and then play the nigga (Slime)
Machine gun friends, twin F&N's (Slatt), stand on ten, I raised the nigga (Brrra)
Shootin' first, then did the verse, my bank account go crazy, nigga (Let's go)
Police keep on tazin' niggas, one shot kill, amazed the nigga (Amazed the nigga)
Shiesty, that's my Dirk Nowitzki, ain't no way I'm tradin', nigga (Can't trade 'em in)
No shade, I'm too rich to fade, he ran up, so I blazed the nigga
(Man)

Sent your mama to snitch on me, man, these niggas some bitches (They bitches)
Makin' posts, sendin' threats and shit, where I'm from, man, that's snitchin' (They snitchin')
Might jump out on your block with the semi and get to tickin' (Brrra, brrra)
Race to you with this choppa, stand over you 'til you finished
My niggas ig'nant (They ig'nant), so many choppas in one car, man, look, this shit ridiculous (This shit ridiculous)
We drove fourteen hours from Memphis (From Memphis) with dope and some Glizzies (Some Glizzies)
We keep steppin' and keep on spinnin', we constantly be sinnin' (Sinnin')
Choppa Gang run the city
Man

Man, this shit crazy (Crazy)
