3 ContributorsRight About Now Lyrics
Yeah, this that new Kweli
I'mma give it to you before the bootleggers get hold of
It
You know what I'm sayin'?
I figure I put it out first, make some money wit' it
Why not, right?
Okay, 1-2

Yo I'm Brooklyn like the '90s
Brownsville and Bushel keep it grimey
When I'm from flatbush that's where you'll find me
In Brooklyn, Tek wit' Justin and Sadat
And Free and Sid from ???
Always catch me wit' Juju and Rubiks, we was truant kids
Dollar band nooseses
Jump bell, run, and never look back
Mr. Man kept the hammer in his bookbag
Rubiks introduced me to Black and Forte
DJ Enuff on Avenue K I go back a long way
Wit' Super Nat in Washington Square freestylin' everyday
Peformin' at Lyricists' Lounge who ate off Jean Grae
Fuckin' wit' Mood is how I met Hi-Tek
Black Star came in effect when Elijah gave my tape to Mos Def
Reflection Eternal was next on deck
My crew the best and we proved it
We knew our music was the Vanguard of a movement
Every Rawkus release was bangin', they on the come up
They was like fuck the radio 'til Pharoahe said "Get the fuck up"
Flex listened, jabbin' at Bryant
The next position was right about now we need the
Radio hit written
While I hit the road
On tour to support the records since the day it was sold
Corey had me followin' the example of De La Soul
Common and The Roots to me these the sickest niggas
Get my figures wit' the Okayplayers and the Spitkickers
Rawkus got a deal with MCA, this the gray area
The letters stand for Music Cemetery of America
They tried to fool you by switchin' the name to Geffen
Now they Interscope's bitch and every artist who had a chance left 'em
Ain't no big surprise, wasn't no love there
Jimmy Iovine never signed me, I just kinda ended up there
But fuck that, literally it was my way or the highway
Hit the road with the Beastie Boys and toured Europe with Kanye
Gotta thank 'em for the love on the album
I knew out on "Electric Circus"
He'd get it by any means necessary like Malcolm
I dropped a single, shot a video, took control of my situation
Got a label poppin', it's a celebration (bitches)
Yo boy Free I had to get out
I put you on, that's where I'm at right about now
You might also like
And if you're sayin' it's my time, you right about now
This what's goin' through my mind right about now
Hey yo, hey yo, it's time to write about now
And if you lookin' you can find it right about now
I put you on, that's where I'm at right about now
This what's goin' through my mind right about now
Yo, hey yo, it's time to write about now
And if you lookin' you can find it right about now

That's right bitches, Talib Kweli
One of the baddest motherfuckers you've ever seen
That's right bitches, Talib Kweli
You're now rockin' with the best! I said it
The best! The best!
That's right bitches
You're now rockin' with the best! The best!
Talib Kweli
Where's-Where's my snares? Talib Kweli
Where's-Where's my snares?Embed
