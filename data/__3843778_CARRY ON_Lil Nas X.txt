F-F-Freezin' like the fuckin' Wynter

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
(F-F-Freezin' like the fuckin' Wynter)

My flow so cold, you notice it (Notice it)
My dreams unfold, behold this shit ('Hold this shit)
Had my life rearranged, it's strange as shit
Not the same as before, I changed a bit

How you leave your son all alone?
See you every other month, can you hit a nigga phone?
Mama, can't believe you let that nigga turn you from your home
You ain't even who you used to be, the person that I've known
Guess I have to carry on (F-F-Freezin' like the fuckin' Wynter)

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
You might also like
My flow so cold, you notice it (Notice it)
My dreams unfold, behold this shit ('Hold this shit)
Had my life rearranged, it's strange as shit
Not the same as before, I changed a bit

Worry 'bout my health, bad thoughts, when I'm gonna die?
I like to get high 'cause it distract me when I wonder why
'Fore my grandma died, I wasn't there, I wasn't by her side
Knew that she was dying, didn't put my selfish shit aside (F-F-Freezin' like the fuckin' Wynter)

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
(F-F-Freezin' like the fuckin' Wynter)

My grandma died, I shed some tears
My mama lied, she left me here
I keep secrets, can't tell a soul
Trust me and myself, that's all I know
My family split, can't live like this
No reunion shit, just who that is
I just pretend it's all okay
I'ma kill everything that's in my way
My flow so cold, I must admit
My dreams unfold, behold this shit
Had my life rearranged, it's strange as shit
And not the same as before, I changed a bit (F-F-Freezin' like the fuckin' Wynter)

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on10Embed
