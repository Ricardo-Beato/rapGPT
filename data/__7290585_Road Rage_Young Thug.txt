Taurus

Hopscotchin' through the street, I'm tryin' not to fall
She pray to God that I make it home before tomorrow mornin'
I'm tryna tell her to pick a Rollie, but she don't care at all
Don't care nothin' 'bout my drank, my portion's what I'm comin' for
I been keepin' up with my city
High performance on my jacket, Rolls-Royce truck for extra fifty
Just in case I run into her, I'm tryin' my best to stay spiffy, yeah

See the pussies on the sideline wishin' that I fall
Pull the skeletons out the closet, I'm 'bout to tell it all
I just want my money, my hoes and all my kids to ball
I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl
Yeah, I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl, oh, yeah
I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl

Evеry time they call in, young nigga ballin'
I went from tеllin' them to try me to callin' shots
And I wanna know what's on your mind, what you thinkin' 'bout
And I wanna know if I can change it, let's take you out
Private flight to France, such a change the trends
I bought her a Richard, now she dance like ants in her pants
Red and white diamonds on my mans, he a ambulance
Half a million to my dad, salad dressing, bought a ranch
He said his last two weeks been busy, I'm movin' in
I told my mom look out her window to another Benz
She took nine shots of Patrón, 50 Cent
I bent the corner and seen my bros gettin' rich
Signed another check for a couple million on a jet
Swear to God, 2006, my sickest dream was buyin' a 'Vette
Bought that shit and then I wrecked and then I copped another one
Smoked forty-one, this your last batch and I got more to come
Gettin' them bales up by the metric ton, hit up feds or somethin'
Bought a Bentley with a credit card, it's the blackened one
I got shows way in Hong Kong, I'm the chosen one
You frozen tongue, you won't say it twice, I'll greet you with a gun, nigga
You might also like
See the pussies on the sideline wishin' that I fall
Pull the skeletons out the closet, I'm 'bout to tell it all
I just want my money, my hoes and all my kids to ball
I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl
Yeah, I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl, oh, yeah
I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl4Embed
