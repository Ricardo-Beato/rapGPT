Dolla
Dolla $ign (Let's go)

Two, three, four, five in the morning (What's up?)
I know that you see that I'm on you (I know you see me, baby, yeah, Helluva made this beat, baby)
Shawty, I can read your mind (Thinking that it's time to make that move, move)
So baby, here's what we gon' do (Talk to 'em, homie)
Tell your friends good night today (Tell your girls good night)
Come on, meet me outside today, hey (Meet me outside)
Let me change your life, babe (Let me change your life)
All I need is one night, baby (All I need is one night, yeah, yeah)

Street certified, they ain't never lied
Niggas killed me ten times, I ain't never died
She love when I talk that blunt shit (Talk that shit)
Watch what they do, I'm on my shit (Yeah)
Future so bright, I had a dark past (Past)
All odds against me, thought I wouldn't last (Yeah)
Blood in my vein, be my lifeline (Lifeline)
Swear we gon' ball for a lifetime (Swear)
Us against the world, I'ma hold you down
California king with the queen, I'ma put it down
Can't rush this, I'm like no way (No way)
Take my time, hope you like foreplay
You might also like
Two, three, four, five in the morning (Huh? Yeah)
I know that you see that I'm on you (I know you see me, baby, yeah)
Shawty, I can read your mind (Thinking that it's time to make that move, move)
So baby, here's what we gon' do
Tell your friends good night today (Tell your girls good night)
Come on, meet me outside today, hey (Meet me outside)
Let me change your life, babe (Let me change your life)
All I need is one night, baby (All I need is one night, yeah, yeah)

Boss up, baby, ain't no other way (Ain't no other way)
It's me and you, baby, ain't no other play
Put you on G, show you how to move (Show you how to move)
Nigga ain't me, you need another dude (Yeah)
I got the brains and the hustle (Say what? Uh)
I got the grind and the muscle (Yeah)
I'm tryna make you better than you ever been
Stack more paper than you ever spent
You done fucked around and found a real one
Streets or the office, get a deal done (Yeah)
Can't rush that, I'm like no way
Take my time, hope you like foreplay

Two, three, four, five in the morning (What's up? Ayy)
I know that you see that I'm on you (I know you see me, baby, yeah)
Shawty, I can read your mind (Thinking that it's time to make that move, move)
So baby, here's what we gon' do
Tell your friends good night today (Tell your girls good night)
Come on, meet me outside today, hey (Meet me outside)
Let me change your life, babe (Let me change your life)
All I need is one night, baby (All I need is one night, yeah, yeah)
All I wanna do is see you live your dreams
Everything I do is all for the team
What's up? Haha

I know that you see that I'm on you (So sexy)
So let me know what you wanna do
Shawty look so good, she so fine
Got that sexy feel without tryin'
Take you from the hood, never give you back
Baby girl, let me know if you're into that
We gon' have a good, good time
Know you got your own, baby, I'ma spend mine
Over here where we winnin' at
Baby girl, let me know if you're into that
Are you into that?

Two, three, four, five in the morning
I know that you see that I'm on you (I know you see me, baby, yeah)
Shawty, I can read your mind (Thinking that it's time to make that move, move)
So baby, here's what we gon' do
Tell your friends good night today (Tell your girls good night)
Come on, meet me outside today, hey (Meet me outside)
Let me change your life, babe (Let me change your life)
All I need is one night, baby (All I need is one night, yeah, yeah)
All I wanna do is see you live your dreams
