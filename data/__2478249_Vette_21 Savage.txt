Vette
Pull up inna vette
Pull up inna vette
Audemar Piguet
Pull up inna vette
I just spent a check
Pull up inna vette
Pull up inna vette

Pull up inna vette
Audemar Piguet
I got it off a brick, got it off a brick
Pull up inna vette
Pull up on ya bitch
I just spent a check
I just spent a check
What you want for that pussy, I'll pay, pay, pay (Yeah)
Bitch I get money, I get cake, cake, cake (Yeah)
And I whip that dope like cake, cake, cake (21)
I don't want no features, niggas gay, gay, gay (21, 21, 21)

Niggas gay, I'm ashamed
But I'm still with that fucking slaughter gang
That slaughter team, we paint the scene red
You niggas scare red, and I'm drinkin red
Young savage, living lavish (21)
I picked yo hoe up then I took her to the cabin (Skrrt, skrrt)
She wanna be with me her nigga is a has-been
Bosch smoking in the back we look like cabbage
Boy you smoking on that bush straight on that bad bitch (21)
I'll shop when I land don't need no baggage (21)
You wouldn't even know what to do if you had a bad bitch (Bad bitch)
100k on red bottoms for my stallion (21)
Hey I'm still whippin' work, whippin' work, whippin' work, aye
Choppa go beserk, go beserk, go beserk
Put you on a shirt, on a shirt, on a shirt (Woah)
Get yo bitch cause she keep tryna flirt, tryna flirt (21)

I got it off a brick (Yeah), got it off a brick (21)
Pull up inna vette
Pull up on ya bitch (Skrrt, skrrt)
I just spent a check

What you want for that pussy, I'll pay, pay, pay
Bitch I get money, I get cake, cake, cake
And I whip that dope like cake, cake, cake
I don't want no features, niggas gay, gay, gay (21)

Ran out motherfucker with these boss it gonna stay like that
Can't fuck with you snitches my boy's youngin' caught a case like that
Mmm, caught a case like that

You niggas ain't right kinda fishy

I respect you, but ya hoes I been trickin'
Betta watch what you puttin' ya dick in
Expensive pants can't even zip em'
Take a nigga's pants if you strip him
Nigga diamonds dancin' like a stripper
Pussy nigga playin' gotta flip him
Spot talk you know nothing bout it
Drought nigga won't know nothing bout it
Got the salt, no dancing
Shots if a fuck boy playin'

Still put ramen noodles on my tummy, yeah
Every mall nigga bunkin', yeah (21)
