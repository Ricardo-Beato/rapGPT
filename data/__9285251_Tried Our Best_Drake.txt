Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh

I swear that there's a list of places that I been with you, I wanna go without you
Just so I can know what it's like to be there without havin' to argue
Swear I didn't have the discipline to leave your ass at home, you make it hard to
This life'll take a lot of listenin' to one another, shouldn't have involved you
I know not to lie, oh
Leave you at home if I wanna have a good night
Leave you at home if I wanna have a good time
Peace of mind
Leave you at home, bein' honest with you sometimеs, I might
Leave you at home, bluе bubbles blowin' my line, hard times
Stressed out, bad vibes

Treat you like
Treated you like
You're one of mine
Treated you
Treated you
Treated you, treated you
Treated you, treated you
Treated you, treated you
Treated you, treat you right
Treat you right
You might also like
There's no ribbon given to anyone that you dealt with
No badge of honor, no ceremony or benefits
I gotta start us up a support group with a membership
Your girl's in the bathroom laying down white lines like some premises
Wockhardt and Sierra Mist
Champagne, Eggs Benedict
Zoom call with her therapist
I'll cater to you, girl, but late night, you a terrorist
The girl that the boy cherishes workin' late night at the Pyramid, and it ain't right
Ain't something I can make right
Fucking up another date night
Fucking up another great night
Message read like a brake light
Words sharp like a steak knife
Fishing for some answers in that ocean with a fucking great white
We in the club with your gay friends
Always put you on a straight flight
You YSL like buy me some
I'm YSL like a snake bite
I swear to God, you think I'm Shakespeare
That's why you always wanna play, right?
This ain't something I can make right

Treat you like
Treated you like
You're one of mine
Treated you
Treated you
Treated you, treated you
Treated you, treated you
Treated you, treated you
Treated you, treat you right
Treat you right
Treat you right
Treat you right
(Wockhardt and Sierra Mist)
(Treated you, treated you)
(Treated you, treated you)
(Treated you, treated you)
(Treated you, treated you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
