(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Take a shot, then turn up on his shit, give me that D'USSÉ dick
'42, pour Azul, make me do some crazy shit
Fucked him good, now he shakin', call that nigga crazy legs
Mixin' blue with the green hundreds, that shit look like crazy bread
That ain't my man, but that's my man, though, so watch your hands, ho
He tryna holler when you ain't looking, just stop shakin' his hand, bro
Told that nigga give me the money, don't know what you playin' for
This expensive, don't bе touchin' on what you ain't payin' for
Eat my coochie, let's make a moviе, nigga
I'm talkin' ASMR, let me hear you chew it, nigga
The only L I hold got that V right there next to it
My pussy tight, but I might let him add some stretch to it, ah

Tell her shake it, drop her friends off, and take her pants off
Tell him spend it, you ain't got no money, keep your hands off
Chain one-eighty, it's expensive, bitch, just keep your hands off
I'm a boss, I could buy the same thing my man bought
Shake that booty (Yeah, yeah)
Shake that booty, bitch (Shake that booty, bitch)
Shake that booty (Baow, baow)

Told the bitch to shake her ass, told me put some ones on it
Told the bitch to kiss my ring, just don't put your tongue on it
Told the bitch bring a chair, I can put my guns on it
Told this bitch this belt Chanel so she know she can't pull on it
When the DJ play you back to back, this shit feel good, don't it?
Never trip about no politics, I know the hood want it
Order bottles, I don't even drink, I know the hood want it
Got my Glock inside the VIP, I wish you would want it
Bounce your booty, uh, uh, make a movie, bitch
Shake your boobies, uh, I'm like a groupie, bitch
That lil' bitch never turn down money, I don't give a fuck who she with
The strip club got the best chicken wings, give me six

Tell her shake it, drop her friends off, and take her pants off
Tell him spend it, you ain't got no money, keep your hands off
Chain one-eighty, it's expensive, bitch, just keep your hands off
I'm a boss, I could buy the same thing my man bought (Ah)
Shake that booty (Yeah, yeah)

All of that talking in circles, just save it (Yeah)
I don't wanna flirt with you, nigga, just pay me (Huh?)
He gotta go if he ain't comin' with it
Me and a broke nigga ain't getting entangled (Ah)
I want a Birkin-'kin-'kin-'kin ('Kin-'kin)
Finna find out that SSN
Do a nigga how he think he finna do me
Get what I want, then I go missing (Ah)
He send a text, say he mad at me, why? (Why?)
He tryna FaceTime and you know I decline
I don't call you when you be with them hoes
So don't blow me up when you see I'm with mine (Baow)
Thinking you player, she gon' air you out when she mad, hmm (Spazz, nigga)
And I don't kiss you 'cause I know you eating ass, yeah (Ah, ah, ah)
You getting beside yourself, find yourself 'fore I make you hide yourself
Who the fuck pumpin' these bitches? Bitches is ass just like they hydrogel (Just like they hydrogel)
I see how your mama felt, finna go find my belt
Try pull my card and get dealt
Bad bitches get good gifts and that's word to the ride I'm in, ah

Tell her shake it, drop her friends off, and take her pants off
Tell him spend it, you ain't got no money, keep your hands off
