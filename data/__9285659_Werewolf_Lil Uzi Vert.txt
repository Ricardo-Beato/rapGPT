Deep down, I'm jealous of the daywalkers
When nighttime comes
I stare at the moon
And I turn into a stalker
Witness me

Woah, what?

Got bare bad bones in my backpack
I burnt through all of my nine lives (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'll never get past the borderline
You think you know me well
But how well do you know Hell? (Woah)
Nowhere left to go now but underground

And this darkness has become a haven
I'm going deeper underground, can't face it

Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Picked up where you left off
I pray on my knees to my protector
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Get off to the blood that was left on the scene, it was destined
I was blessed with a curse and I can't even doubt it
I was blessed with a curse and I can't even doubt it
I was blessed with a curse and I can't even doubt it
I was blessed with a curse and I can't even doubt it

And this darkness has become a haven
I'm going deeper underground, can't face it
Better off dead in the ground, can't see you around, so long
And, yeah, the shadows have become a haven

Deep down, I'm jealous of the daywalkers
When nighttime comes
I stare at the moon
And I turn into a stalker
Witness me

And this darkness has become a haven
I'm going deeper underground, can't face it
Better off dead in the ground, can't see you around, so long
And, yeah, the shadows have become a haven

Witness me (Witness me)4Embed
