31 ContributorsRealer Lyrics
(Ahem)
Check, check, check
LilJuMadeDisBeat

Ay, say, nigga, I don't wanna talk
Meet me at the bank, show me what you really ’bout
Niggas ain't real when the shit really count
That's why I keep my lil’ cat in they mouth
Say, bitch, I don't gotta cap
Everything I talk, yeah, I really did that
If you want beef, then my bitch gon' scratch
I'ma get the money, so I let her handle that (Woo)
Free JT (Ayy)
Real bitches fuck wit' me (Ayy)
I don't do shit for the free, man
Y'all niggas gotta pay me (Ayy)
Put some respect on my team (Huh)
I'm the 1501 queen (Ayy)
Bitch, you better learn who run it
’Cause all this money gotta come through me (Ayy)

I keep it realer than real
Fuck all the critics and fuck how they feel
I’m getting money, it is what it is
They wanna know how I did what I did
Don't worry ’bout why I do what I do (Bitch)
'Cause I ain't worried bout you (Bitch)
Nah, I don't wanna be cool (Bitch)
Still hanging with the same crew (Ayy)
You might also like
Cut a nigga off and my checks got bigger
Rich bitch shit, got a broke ho bitter
Outta any bitch, I’m the hardest in the litter
If you think she bad, put her in, let me get her
Y'all praisin' bitches that's doin' the minimum
They put that check in my hand, now I'm killin' 'em
Don't wanna link with these bitches, ain't feelin' 'em
I'll knock the shit out that bitch like a enema, ahh

Yeah (Hmm)
I know these bitches want the recipe for this hot shit
I told them bitches I ain't gon' let one hater stop shit
(I ain't gon' let no hater stop shit)
Gucci down, these niggas love the way I rock shit
I'm a real rap bitch, this ain't no pop shit

Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah
These hoes know who to play with
On the internet, all with the gang shit (Ayy)
They love to talk hot shit with a lame bitch
But when they come around me they don't say shit (Okay)
Ayy, yo' shit ain't pop 'cause it ain't hot
Keep talkin' trash, I'ma come take you out
Straight to the top, you cannot reach me
Ain't fuckin' these niggas, I'm makin' 'em eat me
Got that big budget with no major deal
Don't wanna fly out to go eat a meal
I am not signing for less than a mil
If you don't like it, then fuck how you feel
Dreams, fuck with Kel
J-bone, what's the deal?
In the section with the bands
Bring them girls over here
I keep it realer than real
Fuck all them critics and fuck how they feel
I'm getting money, it is what it is
They wanna know how I did what I did
Don't worry 'bout why I do what I do (Bitch)
'Cause I ain't worried bout you (Bitch)
Nah, I don't wanna be cool (Bitch)
Still hanging' with the same crew (Ayy)7Embed
