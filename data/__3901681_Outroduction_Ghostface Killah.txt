Yo, Ghost Killah Lost Tapes. You hear that dusty shit? You hear that soul shit? You hear that fly shit? The man has been an inspiration to me and to millions and gillions of motherfuckers for years, one of a kind. There's only one Ghostface Killah; there's only one Pretty Toney; there's only one Starkey Love; there's only one Ghost Deini. Yo, from the bottom of my heart. What an honor, what a privilege to be walking you through the Ghostface Killah Lost Tapes. Michael Rapaport. Sincerely, sincerely this was— this was— this— yo, yo Deini this is my motherfucking privilege dude. This is my motherfucking honor dude. Asked me "Yo, would I be a part," I say where and when. There's no questions asked. To be a part of the Ghostface Killah shit, to be a part of some Ghostface Killah shit, to be a part of the Ghost— the Ghost Lost Tapes. Where and when? Sign me up, I'm ready to go. I'm out. DeiniYou might also likeEmbed
