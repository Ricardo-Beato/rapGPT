25 ContributorsWake Up Lyrics
Ayo Hov, tell 'em, hip-hop better wake up
Yeah, turn the motherfuckin' music up
Yeah, turn the motherfuckin' music up

Motherfuckers betta wake up, stop sellin' crack to the black
Hope you bought a spare for your flat
Can't accept me talkin' real facts
Down the hill like Jill and Jack, I speak what ya weak mind lacks
Ya heard that?
I'm creative to the fullest
What you talkin' bout Willis
'Cause your talkin' never kill it
I hear but don't feel it
Thou ain't realest, you just sweet meat in the village
Yeah I'm a Don Diva, Don Niva
Y'all not seen her, heater squeezed into a wife beater
Yep I'm a top leader, I got the Martin Luther King fever
I'ma feed ya, what ya teacher need to preach ya
It's time to get serious, black people all areas
Who gon' carry us? It ain't time to bury us
'Cause music be our first love, say "I Do", let's cherish it

If you don't got a gun (It's alright)
If ya makin' legal money (It's alright)
If you gotta keep ya clothes on (It's alright)
You ain't got a cellular phone (It's alright)
And ya wheels don't spin (It's alright)
And you gotta wear them jeans again (It's alright)
Yeah if you tried oh well (It's alright)
MC's stop the beef, let's sell (It's alright)
You might also like
Hip-Hop better wake up, the bed to makeups
Some of y'all be faker than a drag on make up
Got issues to take up, before we break up
Like Elektra let go Miss Anita Baker
I love Jacob, but jewelry won't fix my place up
Gotta stay up, studio nights to cake up
Now check my flavor, rich folks is now my neighbors
I got cable, now check out how I made my paper
Hip-Hop don't stop, be my Lifesaver
Like Kobe and Shaq if they left Lakers
I'm like an elevator DJ on the crossfader
Black people wake up and see your ass later

If you don't got a gun (It's alright)
If ya makin' legal money (It's alright)
If you gotta keep ya clothes on (It's alright)
You ain't got a cellular phone (It's alright)
And ya wheels don't spin (It's alright)
And you gotta wear them jeans again (It's alright)
Yeah if you tried oh well (It's alright)
MC's stop the beef, let's sell (It's alright)

I need rims that don't glisten and a booming system
First piece of change I see, I'm gon' get one
745 no license to drive
I ain't even got a home, I guess I'll live in my ride
Fuck it (Rewind)
(I can hear myself, but I can't feel myself)
(I wanna feel myself like Tweet)
745 no license to drive
I ain't even got a home, I guess I'll live in my ride
Fuck it, couple karats in the ear won't hurt
Need a nice chain, laying on this thousand dollar shirt
Evisu Jeans cover the rectum, my kick game just like David Beckham
Anybody in my way, I wet them
I'ma be this way till the cops come catch 'em
Til' detectives sketch 'em
On the sidewalk wit' chalk, New York's infections
Til' I got taught a lesson
Couple niggas gone, couple went corrections
Emory Got 10
Ty got fifteen, nigga even my kin
Got five years bringin' nineteen in
But just think I used to think like them
Now they gotta live through the pictures that I send them in the pen
Hope you don't start ya life where I end
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)

If you don't got a gun (It's alright)
If ya makin' legal money (It's alright)
If you gotta keep ya clothes on (It's alright)
You ain't got a cellular phone (It's alright)
And ya wheels don't spin (It's alright)
And you gotta wear them jeans again (It's alright)
Yeah if you tried oh well (It's alright)
MC's stop the beef, let's sell (It's alright)1Embed
