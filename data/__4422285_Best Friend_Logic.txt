You're my best friend, you’re the air that I breathe
You're the love of my life, the only thing I'll ever need
You’re the reason I wrote this song
You're the one that I've been searching for
Who's been right there all along

My heart is heavier
Been a thousand suns without you
My heart is heavier
Been a thousand suns without you

You're my best friend, you're the air that I breathe
You're the love of my life, the only thing I'll ever need
You’re the reason I wrote this song
You’re the one that I've been searching for
Who’s been right there all along

My heart is heavier
Been a thousand suns without you
My heart is heavier
Been a thousand suns without youYou might also like5Embed
