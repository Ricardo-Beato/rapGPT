11 ContributorsBudget Lyrics
Just left the house, 12 bust in, I was lucky
In the late 90s I wasn’t even rapping, I was hustling
You got a master's degree but your shoes so fucking dusty
Graduated from Georgia Tech and don’t got nothing
Now damnit, end of discussion
I’m not a professor but I’m saying fuck a budget
Budget, I don’t do the budget
Louis luggage, fuck clothes, all I pack is jewelry

Fours on my Masi, make it look like it got crutches
You want a Halle Berry bitch then ball like David Justice
I need some stick deodorant cause my weed is so musty
I'm at Frank Ski with your main bitch and she don’t even know what brunch is
Sipping on that Actavis you sipping Robitussin
Acting like you leaning but you know you really flexing
I’m stupid Gucci, shouting Gucci, yeah I overdoes it
I signed Black Migo Scooter, and told him fuck a budget

Just left the house, 12 bust in, I was lucky
In the late 90s I wasn’t even rapping, I was hustling
You got a master's degree but your shoes so fucking dusty
Graduated from Georgia Tech and don’t got nothing
Budget, budget, motherfuck a budget
Budget, budget, motherfuck a budget
You might also like
1017 that’s my clique, we the brick squad
Y’all all on my dick like a bitch, you the dick squad
There’s plenty pieces of the puzzle but nigga I’m the big pawn
So Icey Boys, OJ, and Gucci Mane, we the brick boys
Riding in Mobile with the scrap like I’m Rich Boy
Two half a million dollar chains like I’m Tit Boi
Money got me gettin' real fat, I’m a big boy
Tried to lock me up for fightin' dogs, Mike Vick boy

Just left the house, 12 bust in, I was lucky
In the late 90s I wasn’t even rapping, I was hustling
You got a master's degree but your shoes so fucking dusty
Graduated from Georgia Tech and don’t got nothing
Budget, budget, motherfuck a budget
Budget, budget, motherfuck a budgetEmbed
