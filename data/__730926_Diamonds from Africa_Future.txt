46 ContributorsDiamonds from Africa Lyrics
Swerve on your passenger
Hang with them scavengers
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow, I'm the one for the traffickin'
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow, I'm the one for the traffickin'
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow, I'm the one for the traffickin'

I'm gone off Ferrari, I'm huggin' that carbon, I never say sorry (Woo)
Put some dope in the cup, go and order the truck, plus the Bentley is comin' (Skrrt)
The end of my sleeve is on plain jane (Pluto)
Sippin' codeine on a plane, man
Most of my niggas, they gangbang (Woo)
Switchin' Moschino my name brand (Name brand)
Switchin' Moschino my name brand (Gang)
Kilo for kilo, young Future Pacino (Pluto, woo)
These bitches, they treat me like Michael and Tito
Go ask your dame, I'm her man, I'm amigo
When that dope ain't got cut on it, call it Gambino
I know the lingo and I know the real
I know a peon got more chains than Deion
I'm the one put all them birds in the Neon
I made your lil' brother hang out the window
I had 'em shootin' up the block like a chulo
I wake up every day like I take photos
I pull up in that new foreign, it's four-door
I had that mouth in the house on the low-low
I got a stallion, pulled up like it's polo
I got that mojo, that mojo on mojo
You bozos, you bozos, you niggas that no-no
You might also like
None of this money, it matter, all of my niggas, they matter (They matter)
I told you I got all these problems that come with this money, so fuck it (Future)
Like fuck all the nonsense (Nonsense)
I sip on that drink and it's muddy (Muddy)
I'm cruisin' the street with a thirty (Thirty)
This the good, the bad, and ugly

I swerve on your passenger
Hang with them scavengers
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow, I'm the one for the traffickin'
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow, I'm the one for the traffickin'
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow, I'm the one for the traffickin'

My styrofoam muddy, my styrofoam muddy, my styrofoam muddy (Woo, woo)
Your bitch, that's my buddy, your bitch, that's my buddy, your bitch, she some cutty (Swear)
I'ma hustle for mine, I'ma get out and grind 'cause I know I deserve it (I does)
And I know how to work it (Pour up)
And I know I ain't perfect
And I know I ain't perfect (I know it)
Buy whatever I purchase (I purchase)
And I'm ready to turn up on ya
Hell fuckin' nah, I ain't nervous (Nervous)
I don't be studyin' these lame lames (Swerve)
I'm just gon' fuck on they main dame (Main dame)
Money is what I'm gon' obtain (Obtain)
Bitch, you can fuck on my main man (Brrt)
If you want that loud, I can smell that it's octane
I hit the block when them blocks came (Them blocks)
I chopped the rock like I'm Bigg and Dame (Bigg and Dame)
Jigga, my nigga, I'm switchin' lanes
Back of the Maybach, my windows and curtains up (Curtains up)
Got them bands, and I ran it up, way up (Way up)
And these niggas ain't nothing but some traitors
Fuck these niggas, they never could play us
None of this money, it matter, all of my niggas, they matter
I told you I got all these problems that come with this money, so fuck it (Future)
Like fuck all the nonsense (Nonsense)
I sip on that drink and it's muddy (Muddy)
I'm cruisin' the street with a thirty (Thirty)
This the good, the bad, and ugly

I swerve on your passenger
Hang with them scavengers
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow, I'm the one for the traffickin'
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow, I'm the one for the traffickin'
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow, I'm the one for the traffickin' (I swear)20Embed
