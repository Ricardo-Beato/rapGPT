5 ContributorsMisdemeanor Lyrics
From NY to Compton real respect real
One hand on the wheel, one hand on the steel
Roll that, pass that, cock that, blast that
Flip that, flash that, I'm always where the cash at
That's why I'm in a nigga crib screaming where the stash at
Nigga come up with the chips and get hit
This is that beretta bounce, that full clip sound
That six shot revolver dance, now spin around
Anyday gunplay, friday, monday
Strawberry sunday 'll light up your Hyundai
Your hoopty hit up, you ain't dead get up
Nigga, one to the git-ut, 'll hurt more than your sit ups
It's nasty it's foul right, this is what my style like
Bang Bang, G-Unit's the gang, man
I reload and unload, I explode
On the track I'm more addicting than crack, better yet to smack
I'll take you higher and higher 50 is fire, word to Maniyah
This is just the beginning, I'm not done winning
Pray the lord keep me from sinning, the shit that I been in
Got me ready to squeeze and breeze, fuck the d's
Niggas spit bars, but they not like these
This is that porsche carrera Ferrari F-50 flow
The type shit that bring flocks of hoes
Can you feel it, I make you feel it
I'll have the hood in a frenzie on some real shit
You rocking with the don dada, the blood clot charters
Follow orders, they treat me like I walk on water
I'm the tapdance king when I come to the bricks
I get to steppin in the name of love and shit
Trust me, this is not what they expected
The kid back around to wreck shit
Niggas reline em, the wolves 'll find em, the jewels 'll blind em
The unit be shining like no other motherfucker
You might also like
It's dirty
Ya know we couldn't find an instrumental, so we still had to do
What we had to do, you know
It's 50 nigga, ya supposed to like it if i say you supposed to
Like it
Yayo, it's filthy round here man, it smells like prostitution
HAHAHA, I'ts going down man all my block niggas, my far rock niggas
My Southside niggas, Supton, Linden, Bazeley, 40 projects
Every projects You know how we do it man
HAHAHA, there's nobody better, niggas know that
Come on man, I rap 'til the motherfuckin' beat gone man
Niggas is smoking if they think they can fuck with meEmbed
