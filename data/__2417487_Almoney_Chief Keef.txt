Glo Gang
You know, I got all that motherfuckin' money, man
Shit
It just came though

I got bond money, ayy
Sean John money
P. Diddy money
Sean Carter money
Jay-Z money
I got all the money
Gotta make all that money
Gotta get all that money
I need all that money, bitch
What you call that money, bitch?
Balling, Spalding
Got some killas down up in New Orleans, ayy
Killas on the westside, Chicago
Them my vatos
But, they no lacking
They stay on folks
And they so goddamn awful, ayy
Just bought a 4-O
I ain't buying no 4-O's no more
I'm tired of those, ayy
Buy some MACs now, ayy
MACs up at ya nose, fuck nigga
At yo door, ayy
Astronaut, I'm getting extra money, extra slow, extra far
To the top
Getting guap
Where your thot?
I know she know Almighty, ayy
Boy, you know she want Almighty
She'll be going for Almighty, ayy
Where you going? With Almighty ayy, ayy
And I'm gloin', ayy
I got my pistol and I'm blowing, ayy
Too many niggas, let it pass, ayy
Next time, I'm gon' get they ass, ayy
Fuck niggas got my chain
Slide through, blow a nigga brains
What? I ain't tripping, mane
Why? 'Cause bitch, I'm getting cake, ayy
I said bond 5 out
Gave you the chain and said pawn that now
20 thousand cash, I pay for that
Nigga that's your ass, play with that
Heard you tryna sell it for 10 bands
What the fuck is going on, man? On man
I'm going in man, I'm going strong, man
Smoking strong pack, it's my cologne, man
Ayy, money what I'm on, man
Catch you in traffic, Reese Money ya, man
Ayy, ayy, smoking tha, Tooka, ayy
My bitch she taking tha hookah
All of you, all of me, all of we
She ain't choosing, just all of we
All of us, I got all the cars
