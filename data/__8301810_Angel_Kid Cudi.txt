Mm, hm, mm

You're such an angel in your halo
Such an angel in your halo
Where'd you come from? Where'd you come from?
Where'd you come from? Where'd you come from?
Angel in your halo

Tell me, tell me your side of it
You're like the sunrise, it's like you know me
And I'm so lost in a dream
When asleep, there'll you be

You're such an angel in your halo
Such an angel in your halo
Where'd you come from? Where'd you come from?
Wherе'd you come from? Where'd you comе from?
Angel in your halo
