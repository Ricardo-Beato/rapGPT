68 ContributorsMight as Well Lyrics
So I ain't have to scheme
Rawest diamonds on my team (Facts)
Raw diamonds on lean (Hey)
I took off just like a Rocket (I’m gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem (Facts)
Either way it goes
We buyin’ out the stores (For real)
We ain’t never runnin’ out of lean (Never)
Might as well gon' pour it (Pour)
Racks bustin’ out a nigga jeans (Stunt)
Might as well go and blow it (Facts)
Smoke the loud like nicotine (Smoke)
Talk drugs and I record it (Let's go)
We conversate and I absorb it (I got it)
Theodore, no informant (I got it)
Percocets got me going (Going)
OG, coughing up a lung (Bet)

They got a street story to tell you (Future)
It’s already been done (I got it)
Ammunition overflowin' (I got it)
Tears fillin' up a pond (Woo)
AC blowin’ like it's snowin' (Let’s get it)
I know I’m blessed to speak in tongues (Freebandz)
My words touch a nigga soul (Yeah)
To get you through it, overcome (Skee)
I ride the boats in the ocean (Whoa)
I whipped the car, it was stolen (Stolen)
I got the stars on the ceiling (Ceiling)
I got my charge acquitted (Geah, geah)
I was the one got evicted, yeah (Evicted)
Living with the pink slip
Now I'm ridin' with the pink slip (Yah, yah, hold up)
I done swam with the sharks
Nigga came from the deep end
You will never know what I was in (Come on)
Times were getting rough, we still get in (Gang)
I was sellin' crack when Snoop dropped "Juice and Gin" (Yah, yah)
Run a one room shack with a million in the den (Facts)
