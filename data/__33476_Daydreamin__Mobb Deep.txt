9 ContributorsDaydreaminâ€™ Lyrics
Daydreamin' of dirt bikes, and four wheelers
Shoppin' sprees at the diamond dealer
Hats and jackets, shirts, pants and sneakers
That brand new car smell, we schemin'
Daydreamin' of penthouses in L.A
The illest yachts, the hottest broads they make
Can't wait 'til it's my turn to get dough
So I don't gotta fuckin' daydream no more

Coming up we ain't have much, a lot of canned food
Cereal in the white box, with powdered milk too
My moms couldn't buy me the shoes I want
We put lay-away on shit that only cost a few bucks
At school, they had Shell Toes, I had Olympians
With the weak ass velcro, looking ridiculous
I knew, way back then, we had to step it up
Cause waiting for the bus in the snow wasn't us
Me and Hav' took the train from Manhattan to Coney
Every day and night, just so we can get our songs done
We had guns, weed, and a couple of fourties
If we got lucky on the way, we could jook someone
We used to watch Video Music Box
And pray maybe one day, we could get a shot
Outside, my niggas had all that shit you see on TV
From money that they made off the block
You might also like
Daydreamin' of dirt bikes, and four wheelers
Shoppin' sprees at the diamond dealer
Hats and jackets, shirts, pants and sneakers
That brand new car smell, we schemin'
Daydreamin' of penthouses in L.A
The illest yachts, the hottest broads they make
Can't wait 'til it's my turn to get dough
So I don't gotta fuckin' daydream no more

My day dreams, is more like nightmares
A vigi, bullet proof cars, supped up time shares
My friends did a turn cause it's not they turn
Or how the streets gonna be, when they release fur
When I get that million bucks, will I remain the same
Or will I have to get at niggas cause they sayin' I changed
Will everybody wanna ball, be my friend and leech
When niggas put me to the test, have me clapping the heat
I used to think bein' rich, ain't all that bad
A far cry from what a dream, was all I had
Do I got the right team, or they riding for cash
Would they jump in front of me, when them cameras flash
Is the 'pop police, gon' be up my ass
Can't leave the heat under the seat, gotta find a better stash
Gotta collect receipts cause that bitch Uncle Sam
Invades your space when you evade his tax
Daydreamin' of dirt bikes, and four wheelers
Shoppin' sprees at the diamond dealer
Hats and jackets, shirts, pants and sneakers
That brand new car smell, we schemin'
Daydreamin' of penthouses in L.A
The illest yachts, the hottest broads they make
Can't wait 'til it's my turn to get dough
So I don't gotta fuckin' daydream no moreEmbed
