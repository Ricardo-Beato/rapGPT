21 ContributorsHandcuffs Lyrics
Ok kid
Say what you gotta say

You know what I'm sayin'
You know, some niggas really out there bad
You know what I'm sayin'
Some niggas is forced in positions where they gotta do things where they don't wanna do it
You know what I'm sayin'
So some niggas forced to dope, sell dope
Some niggas forced to pimp
You know what I'm sayin'
But you got some niggas out there that
Just lazy, you know what I'm sayin'
Niggas ain't forced to do nothin'
Niggas got other options they just choose not to do 'em, you know?

Sittin' in the back of the police car position
Your mission is forgetting and denying the existence
Thinking of different ways to keep from submitting
And continuing to not to mention
...like that
Grand Marquis Police Interceptor edition
With the wall so you can barely fit in
Knees is touching the front seat, shifting
Cause your handcuffs is cutting your wrist and
Your wishing that he would drive faster pleeease
But he slows through the hood as he drives past the free
It's cool but you tripping:
The quicker you get there
The quicker you sit there
Cuffed to a bench and
They playing good cop, bad cop
One of the them pretending
So you rewind yourself
To your uneasy recline in the back of the police car
Hand-cuffed and the seat belt
Nah, you ain't gotta quicken the pace
That just give me more time to sit and erase
Alibi and alias, switch and replace
Think about then, forget about an escape
Thank God that I'm up in the states
'Cos if I was in Russia who knows how they'd do a hustler
Wait, I ain't a hustler, I'm straight
I'm damn near a buster, no laws I break
Money I never seen, guns I didn't hold
Drugs I never sold, calls I didn't make
Nigga this is a waste of your time and mine
"Is that uncomfortable?"...."I'm fine"
A case? This ain't even a fine
You ain't find nothing, homie, not even a dime
Not even a dime that'll drop dime on me
I know you was dying so you put a dime on me
I know that's a crime, you supposed to fight crime for me
Protect and to serve
Prosecute, correct and return to the homies
And thats gonna send them direct to the curb
So you can put 'em back on me

Handcuffs (10X)

He's sitting in the front of the police car position
His mission is bending, pinning charges on niggas
Even if they didn't
He's sitting in court lying
Testifying against defendants
...Like that
And he love to choke niggas
He don't trip with the rich
He just like the broke niggas
Probably did more dirt in the street than most niggas
Even the old people don't like him
'Cos of the way he approach niggas
Nigga, you ain't no better than me
Just a hustler with a badge
Confiscate the dope money
Put it with your retirement boat money
You ain't building no playgrounds
In the poor for some cash
That ain't a pension
That's a shoe box stash
With a Glock to protect it
We both undercover, check it
Thinking that the good we do
Gon' out weigh the sinning that we do to collect it
Saying "it's for the community"
They don't value us
Only around because the property value up
And they gotta clean the street before they put the houses up
Knock them Section 8's down
Put them 200,000's up
Feel he don't get paid enough
To kick in doors, to raid and cuff
So he use what niggas get on the street
To supplement the wages cut
So he gotta keep just enough niggas out there hustling
To keep his paper up
...Like that
Maybe he should be in the handcuffs
