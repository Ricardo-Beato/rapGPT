44 ContributorsGET MONEY BROS. Lyrics
30, you a fool for this one
Ear Drummers
Lil Boat
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Burn his ass out like a skillet (Woo)
All that shit talking online gon' and kill it (Woo)
Throw them legs up and I promise I'll drill it (Woo)
Whip wasn't high enough, I told 'em lift it
Check wasn't high enough, I told 'em lift it (Woo)
Bought bro a Rollie 'cause my brother gifted
That pussy pretty but I still gotta sniff it
Whole team got chains on, I call that certificate (Uh, ooh)
Where your money lil' nigga?
Wearin' 10 chains don't make your diamonds bigger (No)
Look at my ring, that's a 80
Fuck up V Live when I'm bored wit' Lil Baby
Born in '97 my bitch from the '80s (Woo)
She drive a young nigga crazy

I'm from Detroit between Evergreen and Southfield Road (We come up off the freeway)
Money long as 6 Mile, fuck nigga, but you know I'm so Joy Road (Joy Road)
Shit I seen in my hood made me the type to sneak into awards with my pole (Brra, brra)
Three million, I got that in cash, 400K, got that in gold (Got that in gold)
Crib came with a sauna (Crib came with the sauna)
Beam came on the MAC (Beam came on the bow!)
200 miles a hour (Skrr skrr), this a Hellcat not a Scat (Skrr skrr)
We ain't cosignin' no rats, talkin' to the cops only time these niggas state facts (Only time these niggas state facts)
Leave a nigga brains in his lap, he was driving, chopper put him in the back (Brra)

Everybody 'round us gettin' money, yeah
Niggas in the back, they gunnin', yeah
VVS diamonds so stunnin', yeah (Bling)
A bitch nigga mad, well, so? (So?, Yeah, ayy)

Gotta get guap, gotta get it
Used to ride 'round baggin' hoes in a Civic
Now I pick and choose, I'm super specific
Shawty slurp nut like a Blueberry Mistic (Ew)
Uhh, watch where you steppin'
Bang what you bang, nigga, rep what you reppin'
Don't you dare ever dap me with yo' left hand
Respect my pimpin', I'm ballin' like I'm Pippen

My Uber actin' so janky right now, bro come pick yo bitch up (My shit ain't workin')
You pull up on tip, I'ma headshot you, then gotta pick yo shit up (Boom, boom)
My diamonds so white, I was whippin' the dope, almost got it mixed up (Skrr skrr)
I shaved off my firin' pin, it was one shot, now it got the hiccups (B-Boom, boom, boom)

We the young niggas gettin' money, yeah
Everybody 'round us gettin' money, yeah
Niggas in the back, they gunnin', yeah
