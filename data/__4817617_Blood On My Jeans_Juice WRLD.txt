Ah
Damn, I tried to stop, oh
Baby (808 Mafia), baby (Baby), baby (Baby), babe
You literally are my everything (Baby, Gezin)
Hah (Baby)

Baby, I been on the run (Yeah)
But I would never run from your love (Yeah, uh-uh)
If you feel on my dick, there's a gun (Yeah, uh-huh)
Not right there, just a little above
I value my relationship, it's forever
But I've been cheatin' on the drugs (Yeah)
Broke up with codeine, need a new plug (Yeah)
Hit up Hot Rod, pints, I need two of 'em (Yeah, uh-huh)
Huh, (Drinkin') lean, huh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Put Biscotti in my lungs, I'm smokin' green
Chopper on me, I don't talk, I just up the beam (Ba-ba-bow)
Huh, let my gun bust a nut, then leave (Yeah)
I ain't leave a clue on the scene (Uh-uh)
Close range, so I got blood on my jeans (Uh)

Saints Row cup, ain't no red in my lean (Uh-uh)
Bankrolled up, I been swimmin' in green (Uh-huh)
Still the blue face king (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Benjamin Franklin come dirty and clean (Let's go)
I know my haters hate to see me succeed
If they get the chance, they'll end up murderin' me (Uh-huh)
That shit got me laughin', haha
Kel-Tec get to rappin', grrah, grrah (Bow)
Fuck nigga, I'm your father
Don't matter if you older
They say age is just a number
If that's the case, I'm way older
Than who? These niggas (Uh-huh)
And these bitches that think that they get it (Uh-huh)
For a backstage pass, she'll suck the dick (Uh-huh)
Bitch, I got a bitch, better get you a ticket (Uh-huh)
Walk through the night with my gun like a creep
On my shirt Maison Martin, my shoes double-C
I don't know what it's gonna take you to believe
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't gon' leave you (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't gon' leave you
You stuck with me, apologies for my fuckery
