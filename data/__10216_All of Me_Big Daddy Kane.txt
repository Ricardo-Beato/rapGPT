4 ContributorsAll of Me Lyrics
(Barry White)
Let's get busy
Daddy Kane
(Big Daddy Kane)
You know B.W. I've heard it said
That a woman is a man's greatest gift
(Barry White)
Sure you're right
(Big Daddy Kane)
And success ain't nothin unless you have someone to share it with
(Barry White)
Mmmmm, so true, so true
I've always felt that it's great to achieve in life
Not having someone other than yourself to share it with it is, uhh..
(Big Daddy Kane)
Sho' YOU'RE right
(Barry White)
Quite sad
You might also like(Big Daddy Kane)
In my case, I may have found someone (mmm)
I want, all, of that someone
(Barry White)
Yeah, I know what you mean
Well I'll tell you my friend
Just, communicate with her
And always say what you mean and mean what you say
Because, it's her that you want all of me
Aoww

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane (& Barry White)
Come here baby
Come bring ALL of you to me
When I say I want all of you
I mean I want all of you from your head to your feet (mmm)
I wanna taste everything from your lipstick to your toenail polish
(Communicate Kane brother)
I want you, I want you
I want to hold you, I want to massage you
I want to comfort you, I want to sooth you (mm!)
You know the way you're standin still there
I just wanna lay on the floor and make love to your shadow
(A-heh) Sounds silly don't it? (Not really)
But for real, let me come on over there
Run my fingers through your hair
Hold your Nair, and undo that brassiere
My dear (Daddy Kane)
Because tonight girl, all of me wants, all of you
Ohhhhhhh
Meeeeeeee, all of meeeeeeee
Wants allllllllll of youuuuuuuuuu
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
Over and over and over
Let's do it now, you show me how
Over and over and over again

Oh I can tell you're serious aren't you?
I'm glad to see that you feelin, this way
That there's somebody in this world that..
Make you want to give up that kind of commitment
Love is such a beautiful thing when it's, equally shared
(Tell em Maestro)
When two people, find the same common ground
They call it, having, so much in common
Making love is one of things that people, these days
Seem to find too common (Communicate B.W)
Sho' you right
So I want you to know, that I really feel
That you gonna make it all the way with this young lady
You got my love, my respect
You're bad.. young man, you're bad

Me, all of me
 Ooh baby, mmm
Wants all of you
 All of you
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
 Oh, yeahhhh
Over and over and over
Let's do it now, you show me how
 Can we do this?
Over and over and over again
 And over and over and over and over
Me, all of me
 Yes love, all, of me
Wants all of you
 I want you
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
 Mmmmm, sho' you right
Over and over and over
I want it now, come show me how
 Come show me
Over and over and over again
Me, all of me
Wants all of you
 I want you from head to toe
Let's start tonight, I know you're right
Over and over and overEmbed
