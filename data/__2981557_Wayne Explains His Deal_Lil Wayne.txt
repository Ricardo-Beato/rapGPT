8 ContributorsWayne Explains His Deal LyricsAlright so the streets wanna know
What's Wayne's situation?
They had a lot of rumors
Speculations
That I would be going to another record company
Preferably, the Roc, Def Jam, Jay-Z, Shawn Carter, Jiggaman
No, why? Cause I was
Ya heard me
But I was still under kizontract
Ya heard me
With Kizash Mizoney, ya heard me
But I said, Imma just, ride it out, heard me
And see what, and see what I could do, ya heard me
And so then I figured "Know, Imma go with the Roc
Imma go by Jay" and Jay was tryna help me, he was really tryin', he was like
"Dude whenever you get out your situation, I'm here, here, whatever you need, I'm here"
It's like believe that, then all of sudden I gets a call from Universal and they like "Hey"
They wasn't talkin' no, I couldn't even understand what they talkin' 'bout cause they was talkin' 'bout, millions and stuff, that was words I had never heard of, ya heard me
So I was like "Dayyyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum"
And I was like "Believe that" and so, ya heard me
In reality of it all, I got
I got
Some more time over here, I ain't finished doin' what I was doin', so, what Weezy's doin'? Finishin' up
