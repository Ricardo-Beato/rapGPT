8 ContributorsCEO Lyrics
Look I'm a All Money In CEO
Which means that fly money is the life I chose
And they say I think I'm the shit
But I don't think I know
Cause ain't nobody gave us nuthin we just got our own

Look, hussle
We standin' on the couches poppin' bottles smokin' weed
Fuckin' bitches lovin' life makin' money count cheese
Flow state Cuban links more cake you would think
It's our birthday bitches thirsty but we never let 'em drink
First class leather seats blue Gucci's on my feet
Or either Chuck Taylor's get money fuck haters
What's up to Chuck Taylor my nigga Compton Menace
AR BlackWall forever ya'll my niggas
Lax fifty cities wuts next volume thrizzy
Then December twenty second south central state of mizzy
I bet a hundred thousand that I fuck up the city
The king of L.A. is young Nipsey
And if I'm not I'm so hot I feel I got that right
A nigga slept him that day and he got shot that night
Choices to consequences if I chip him it's life
So getback for me is like... fuckin his wife
Imagine that to transition from Slauson to my position got a deal went to jail my bro wus fresh up out of prison
And niggas looked like I f*ck off wut I was givin
But the truth is I'm not used to this new way I make my livin
And since I can't rewind back to dime sacks and shoot outs and cadillacs a young nigga gotta rap
And goin through it I still knew that I was that, nigga plus the walls on my condo need a plaque
You might also like
Look I'm a all money in CEO
Which means that fly money is the life I chose

I'm a fly money all money in individual
Pullin racks out for a little bit of visual
Independent money but they swear we some criminals
CEO a couple mills is wut 'm gettin to
And I'm all ways workin deals in the livin room
Cannin dirty money still I think we need a bigger room
And when they see me they say quick wut do that nigga do
Bu they can tell that I'm all about some revenue
Spend quick never sit like residue
Or I can show these niggas wut my good credit do
700 or higher u can't clone that
Heard u on a record label already owns that
Something bout Brodee I ain't never gave a loan back
Never had to pay that
Get that money ASAP
Had a big dream like pushin up in a Maybach
On my J Brown shit yea the 'Big Payback'
Dirty money were I'm from never should u trase that
And we coppin property u losin we replace that

And I'm on
Friendinesh put that on the sinernet
All money in I'm droppin after Nip ain't that some shit
They can't believe it's not butter
The nigga in the mix like apple pucker
Fresh off the movie set, phil in her hooters next
Wut the f*ck did u expect
Nigga we the best like f*ck the rest
I whip a bitch I hit the switch I'm the shit yea I admit I'm a dog I'm a ass I last
That nigga bust fast he trash
I'm gone n them upper rooms
Dodgin all them dummy dudes
Duckin all them sucker niggas
Gotta get tougher nigga
I try to tell u lil mama I ain't that other nigga
Wait hold up them niggas got me f*cked up
Talkin bout I lucked
Up really wut the f*ck is up
Back on that bullshit gettin my Mr. Hanky on
Duck duck deuce nigga

Flyer than a sum bitch I run shit
Naw I ain't the CEO but I be in them videos
F*ckin all them groupie hoes
Oh nigga do be told
Wings spread watch em shed nigga yeaarly
Nigga grizzly like the bear be wearly
Nigga spend money like a bitch breath air
