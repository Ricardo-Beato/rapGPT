I'mma tell you like it's just another day in the EAST ATLANTA 6
Just a young nigga n da hood sellin BRICKSS
Just anotha NIGGA

Dis is jus anotha day n da East Atlanta 6
You choosin' me
So you on a dope man dick
You choosin' me
So you on a dope man dick
You choosin' me
So you on a dope man dick

Yellow corvette that's the dopeman's drop (GUCCI)
Blue and white Jacob that's the dopeman's watch (BLING-BLAW-BLING-BLAW)
Bouldercrest Road that's the dopeman's block
Dopeman dopeman, can I please cop?
Police tryna' tell the dopeman stop (NOPE)
Da dopeman thinkin' man I gotta make a knot
Da trap kinda slow
I'm a make dat trap hot
Wacka Flocka flame tell bro to bring a choppa'
I'm a flow throw u back(BACK)
Back 2 89(9)
Moved 2 Atlanta Georgia I was just 9 (9)
Monty Mark Apartment everybody on they grind
Then I moved to Sun Valley everybody had a 9 (9)
Went to school 11 with a muthafuckin' knife
Wen I was 13 I got my first stripe
Got my first stripe
It's Gucci Mane Laflare
Kush smokin, Dro smokin' put it n da air
Nigga dis a Hood Affair every hood everywhere
Wen u hear dis n yo car u gon' wanna pull a chair
Up... Gucci Mane La Flare I b ridin n dat lair
I b so iced up, Kushed up man
All I wanna do is be like Gucci when I grow up
All I wanna do is buy a pound n get Dro'd up
All she wanna do is buy a ball n get snowed up
Tell her dat I got her cause I know dat she's a shopper (shopper)
Shawty want a 8-ball tell her call Wocka (Wocka)
Shawty want a pound tell her Doe gotta her (gotta her)
I'm gonna serve her
Chop her like a burger
Gucci Mane La Flare in this track here is murder
