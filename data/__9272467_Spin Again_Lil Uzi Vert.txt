Ahh (Huh)
Change my number on a bitch in a second (Yeah)
Not about money, then leave me a message (Beep)

Spin again, spin again, just spin again
Pull up in a fish bowl, ooh, clear lens
Spin again, spin again, spin again
Spinnin' shit just like I am a ceiling fan
I got too much wet, I get the bitch, fuck
I get your bitch, fuck (Wet), I get your bitch, fuck (Wet)
Bitch, I'm a dog, mutt (Grr), bitch, I'm a Pit
I leave the bitch stuck, fuck the bitch once, duck

Pop at a opp, duck, fucked on a bitch for lunch
That ho woke up a dub, she need her make-up
I got a lean cup, got ice to the brim, it's crushed
Fucking on mean sluts, I got a nice wife
I'm fucking the dogshit out of this bitch, her wig came off twice
She had a lil' 'fro, she look like Ice Spice
She call me lil' bro, fuckin' on models in Vogue
Niggas, they thought I was gay, but I do not know how though

Spin again, spin again, just spin again
Pull up in a fish bowl, ooh, clear lens
Spin again, spin again, spin again
Spinnin' shit just like I am a ceiling fan
I got too much wet, I get the bitch, fuck
I get your bitch, fuck (Wet), I get your bitch, fuck (Wet)
Bitch, I'm a dog, mutt (Grr), bitch, I'm a Pit
I leave the bitch stuck, fuck the bitch once, duckYou might also like3Embed
