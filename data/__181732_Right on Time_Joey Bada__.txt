My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm

The only lady I can ever match bonds with
On some atomic bond shit, our love is plutonic
But I just can't put my foot on it
My one and my only, we not only lovers but homies
Whenever I'm lonely, right on time she arrives
She know the business for some minutes
I bury that kitty alive, oh no, I'm kidding but I really be in it
And we don't plan on having kiddies
But I really be skinnin', really be raw
They say sex is the weapon, love is really a war
And sometimes I feel threatened 'cause she really know all
My weaknesses, sometimes we fight, won't speak and shit
But we both know what the sequence is
It's like a never-ending cycle, something like your menstrual
The day you put your menopause, I'll pause the instrumentals
That dussace got me in the mental
Me and you until the end of time 'til we no longer existential

Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions
Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions
You might also like
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
No, one man's clever, one knows no better
I like to go get her to keep her warm in cold weather
She blow below better then she goes for endeavors
Write our names on the clouds in bold letters
If hoes ever touch me, she load Berettas
But trust me, she's lusty, it must be me rubbin' it off on her skin
I can't budge her, a pen? I swear that her love is just a sin
We back at it again, fussin' and fightin', I start cussin', she cryin'
Break up to make up, I start cuttin' then slide it in
Then mix the vibe with some Hen, you got five, I got ten
Now we some trippy niggas as high as a fin
But what's your game, love? Already know it
We some ordinary people but extraordinary poets
Get lost in the Moet when I po' it
Fuck it if we drownin' in pain, 'cause we don't really show it

Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions
Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm30Embed
