36 ContributorsC.N.B. Lyrics
Oh, no, oh, no
Oh, no, oh, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, ayy, no, no
Oh, no-no, ayy, no, no

I wake up feeling like I am the coldest nigga breathing
Look in the mirror like, "Goddamn," I know they wanna be him
I wake up feeling like I am the realest nigga walking
So watch your step and watch that shit you're talking, okay?
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
So watch the shit that you say, okay?
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
So watch the shit that you say

On "65," I tell the truth, no lies (I told the truth no lies)
Them sheets and crosses turned to suits and ties (They turned to suits and ties)
In Black America, can you survive? (How well do you survive?)
They made a nuisance once the noose is tied (Soon as the noose was tied)
We gentrified, we victimized, we fighting for survival
No hopes and dreams, just leave us be, we leanin' on the Bible
They preying on us, praying for a better day tomorrow
Hide the fear behind this here bravado (Oh)
You might also like
I wake up feeling like I am the coldest nigga breathing
Look in the mirror like, "Goddamn," I know they wanna be him
I wake up feeling like I am the realest nigga walking
So watch your step and watch that shit you're talking, okay?
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
So watch the shit that you say, okay?
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
So watch the shit that you say

We Black skinheads for real, was bred to kill (Was born and bred to kill)
Been leaving niggas hanging, what you sayin'? (What are you saying?)
Don't shake my hand unless you passing payment (Passing my payment)
Keep your salutations, need my forty acres
Why they hate us? (Why, why, why)
Why they want to rape us for our culture?
They greet, defeat us, bleed us
Then, they leave us for the vultures (Why, why, why)
They break the brilliant off with millions, tryna break they focus
More tan the man, the more alone and hopeless

I wake up feeling like I am the coldest nigga breathing
Look in the mirror like, "Goddamn," I know they wanna be him
I wake up feeling like I am the realest nigga walking
So watch your step and watch that shit you're talking, okay?
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
So watch the shit that you say, okay?
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
So watch the shit that you say15Embed
