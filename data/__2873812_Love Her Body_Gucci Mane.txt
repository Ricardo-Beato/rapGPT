23 ContributorsLove Her Body Lyrics
Zaytoven
Huh
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

You know I'm a gangster I'ma need for you to pray for me
I know these niggas want you, I'ma need for you to wait for me
Love and loyalty, it's not a day she goes unfaithfully
Cause cain't nobody fuck you like me, yeah it ain't no replacing me
Baby girl, you're more than beautiful, you put your trust in me
Know I keep that blammer on me, know I'm your security
Girl you got me invested in you, this is our community
Thankful for this opportunity, treat you like family
I can't even explain it but lil' mama bring out the best in me
I can't break this shit off if I wanted to, it's destiny
I can't even explain it, but lil' mama bring out the freak in me
I'ma break her off in the back seat of my Bentley

Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body, body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body, body?

Baby, you a goddess and I'm not being dishonest
I can't even be modest, cause I'm in love with your body
You worth more than money and you taste sweeter than honey
Your walk is so hypnotic, you erotic plus exotic-xotic
People say I'm trippin' I ain't thankin' bout these bitches
We can share my rise, I give a damn they say I'm trickin'
Super bad bitch I need it, first time I just did it, did it
I can turn you up, I'm filthy, make you laugh I'm super silly
We can hold hands in Lenox
I don't give a damn who with me
These haters need mind their business
Tell the valet bring my Benzes
Please beg my pardon, this not Dolly
I'm the Trap God, she the goddess
Good brain like she went to college
These hoes jellyfish, she can't be solid

Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body, body?
Gucci!
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body, body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?
Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body, body?4Embed
