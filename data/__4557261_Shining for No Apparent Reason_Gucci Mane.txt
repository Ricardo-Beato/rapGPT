3 ContributorsShining for No Apparent Reason Lyrics
Grand , stunting season
Shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
Niggas broke, bitch we eating
Shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
My wrist rocky, my neck freezin
I'm shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
My pockets full, You're breaking even
I'm shining on these hoes for no apparent reason

Waka Flocka!
Waka Flocka Flame, and shawty he a renegade
Green diamond chain, same color as some gaitorade
Deadly like Ades, watch me when I'm on the stage
Born in a rage, I'm finna bust 
These niggas I don't trust, new bitches I gotta fuck
Run up on me, try 
Murder man don't give a fuck
Headshot , Flintstone bed rock
, I'd rather go out like Big or Pac
Before I run into the cops
Beef, I love that shit
It keep me on 
I sware I got an aditude 
He not really , he rappin up China white
He don't like me, punch me on site
Flocka!

Grand , stunting season
Shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
Niggas broke, bitch we eating
Shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
My wrist rocky, my neck freezin
I'm shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
My pockets full, You're breaking even
I'm shining on these hoes for no apparent reason

I don't need a reason, that Kush I'm steady chiefen
Fuck with the robbers 1017,I'm pledging my allegiance
Throwing money in the club, rappers start to leaving
You niggas need to pick it up like the hoes, I know y'all need it
Im eating better yet Im feasting, still cooking, I guess I'm greedy
So Icey ENT,  kill your ass for treason
I got , non believeing
But now you all falling back like your hairlines reseading
Tokyo for me Brick Squad bank accounts in Sweden
Put 30 birds on your dome like it was Falcon season
For no apparent reason, you try to start beefing
Imma call my pieces and turn your bitch ass to a paraplegic
Gucci!

Grand , stunting season
Shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
Niggas broke, bitch we eating
Shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
My wrist rocky, my neck freezin
I'm shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
My pockets full, You're breaking even
I'm shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
Wooh Da Kid, that's my stage name
And I'm surrounded by more ice than a hockey game
My neck froze, and you're the one to blame
And I don't mean  when I say I'm up the chain
My pockets dumb, this nigga broke
Might as well hang yourself, nigga here's a rope
Walking graveyard, it's a murder scene
Dead people everywhere, falling out my jeans
Dead guys, we talking presidents
Rooky to the game, but spit like a veteron
Brick Squad, that's my main clique
Black bird flew, man I think my  sick

Grand , stunting season
Shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
Niggas broke, bitch we eating
Shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
My wrist rocky, my neck freezin
I'm shining on these hoes for no apparent reason
My pockets full, You're breaking even
I'm shining on these hoes for no apparent reasonEmbed
