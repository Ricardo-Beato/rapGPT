30 ContributorsNegro Lyrics
We ain't got same ball lil’ nigga
We ain’t cut from the same cloth, lil’ nigga
Touch you on, I can turn you off, lil’ nigga
Have my young nigga knock you out, lil’ nigga
We ain’t from the same neighborhood, lil’ nigga
We don't play with the same ball, lil’ nigga
We don't get the same good-good, lil’ nigga
We dont smoke the same dope, lil’ nigga
You need to stop chasin' that lil hoe, lil’ nigga
And chase your bankroll, lil’ nigga
Better hope that it don't fold, lil’ nigga
Summer starting to be cold, lil’ nigga
Shawty think I’m a hit the mall up with her
So I had to send Ballout with her
Had to send her luggage with her
I’ma fly out tomorrow, nigga
Pull up to the show lookin’ vatos
A million niggas in this truck, lil’ nigga
Ain't no passive mode
Hope your ass good at duckin', lil nigga
Up This AR in front of you, lil’ nigga
Take your manhood right in front of you, lil’ nigga
You ain’t the only one from my jungle, lil’ nigga
Put a hole in you the size of funyun, lil’ nigga
Back in the day, smokin’ them dubs, smokin’ ‘em 8ths
Now look at me, 14 in my cone, wrist cost me a G
But I had goggles with heat sensors
Enough Monclar for 16 winters
I bought Louis bags, stick green in it
Guarantee your bitch would sleep with it
Now that’s fucked up, my Louis bag get more ass than you
And the monster on the back of this Fendi bag get more cash than you
And these fingers on me, count cash faster than you
'Look up Marlon, say cheese', turn nigga face to the news
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We ain’t cut from the same cloth, lil’ niggaEmbed
