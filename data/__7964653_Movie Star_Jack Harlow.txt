46 ContributorsMovie Star Lyrics
And I know you just hate to see it
Can't imagine being you, ooh, I'd hate to be it
I'm done fakin' humble, actin' like I ain't conceited
'Cause, bitch, I am conceited
You know you can't defeat it
Your girl's a fan of me, in fact, I'm what her fantasy is
Duckin' out the party, we can't let the cameras see us
I'm with a movie star, ooh, young Cameron Diaz
I'm with a movie star, ooh, young Angelina

And I know they say all type of things about this type of life (Huh)
Well, ask yourself, are they right? (Right)
'Cause we can do this every night (Uh-huh)
Fuck all the drama, tryna meet your mama
We don't need condoms, let's make a gеnre
Hot like a sauna, upgrade your Honda
Baе, quit that sobbin', I'll fix all your problems

What's wrong?
You never fucked with someone who writes songs?
I won't use your name if you feel like it don't belong
But I'm just so inspired by the way you wear that thong
You know I like to dictate things, Kim Jong
I know that drink strong
You know we get that bourbon out the barrel, Diddy Kong
Come here, give it to me while I play this Giveon
I keep givin' y'all classics
Tremendous, fantastic (Fantastic)
My spendin' is drastic
She blend in the background and bend that shit backwards
Moncler just in case I end up in Aspen
Told the concierge, "Go ahead, send up the package"
That's the end of it, that's it
You might also like
And I know they say all type of things about this type of life (Huh)
Well, ask yourself, are they right? (Right)
'Cause we can do this every night
Fuck all the drama, tryna meet your mama
We don't need condoms, let's make a genre
Hot like a sauna, upgrade your Honda
Bae, quit that sobbin', I'll fix all your problems

Mmm, but do it jiggle though?
I mean, I get the concept that it's bigger though
I feel like the whole damn city know
You got it done just in time for the video, right?
You got some pretty toes (Yeah)
And I'm pretty close to the top pretty soon
Somethin' not just anybody privy too
Somethin' not just anybody privy too
I do not fuck with that stiff shit
Squad lift shit
I need that peanut butter, yeah, that Jif shit
You and me should do a tape, DatPiff shit
Now get this
I do not fuck with that stiff shit
Squad lift shit
I need that peanut butter, yeah, that Jif shit
You and me should do a tape, DatPiff shit
Now get this
J-jiggle thoughEmbed
