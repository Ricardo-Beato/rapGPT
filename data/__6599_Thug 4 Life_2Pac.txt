Hahaha, right
Thug for life, nigga
Can't you read the signs?
Say "Fuck it", nigga (Just do it)

Mobbin' like a motherfucker, stuck
Can you put your middle finger out the window
Gettin' fucked off liquor, gettin' loaded, can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bozack to the ho-stack, that's for sure, black
So be a mack and keep your dough fat
And tell me, what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce, soon bounced to a key
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt
And now I'm in the rap game, like the crack game, I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug motherfuckers wanna have fun
Stuck in, buckin' my motherfuckin' Magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Bust shots at my adversaries, them niggas scurry
Pick a spot to be buried, â€˜cause I'll be buckin' in a fuckin' hurry

Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em

Game thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin' money, but you stuck on these fake bitches
And jealous motherfuckers can't see
That's it's the fame that caused these stupid bitches to pass the pussy free
So tell me, why you sweat a motherfucker like me?
A young nigga, tryin' to hustle up some Gs
You pussy-ass player hatin' hoes
Dpeakin' down on niggas, jumpin' around at the shows
And you the first motherfucker to jump
To the trunk, when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk
Thug motherfuckers don't die
We get high and we multiply, motherfucker
Give a holler to my niggas in the Bay
I'm livin' in L.A., still clutchin' on my AK

Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, bitch
Yeah, nigga, Thug Life
From now until for motherfuckin' ever
Half-nots in this, motherfucker, yeah
