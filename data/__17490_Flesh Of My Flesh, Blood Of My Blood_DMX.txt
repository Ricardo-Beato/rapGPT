Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood!

Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what

My dogs is dogs with official bloodlines
I say "Stop Being Greedy," get a plate, you want mine
Why do niggas always force you take it back to the streets?
Can I at least go one year without spitting the heat?
Motherfuckers think it's sweet until you get your chest messed up
Two days later he's dressed up, let him rest up
He ain't going nowhere, no time soon
Remember High Noon? Last thing he heard was "Boom"!
Can I get some room or do I gots to, make me a path?
Break you in half, fake niggas make me laugh
Y'all niggas is funny, still talking 'bout money
And ain't got none, get the shotgun 'cause you hungry
It's about to get ugly when the, lights is out
One, two, three, ho that's three strikes you out
His knife was out, I think they found it still in his hand
He in a bag and I'm over here, killing his man!

Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what

I no longer see the shadows that once kept me strong
And I'm starting to get that same feeling that kept me wrong
Can't afford to trust niggas cause niggas lust figures
Plus niggas is scared to bust niggas, rush niggas
Dueling with the heat, and ain't killing nothing but time
Fucking with the street, but you ain't feeling nothing but mine
Tired of hearing niggas rhyme that don't say shit
Fuck is on them niggas minds, why don't they quit?
Sucking my dick looking for something new
Let your man hold something with your hold something crew
You know how niggas do, we don't forget shit
If you was there when it's thin, then you there when it's thick
No hitchhikers, fuck that, the Ryde was Ruff
And every nigga that was wit us, that died was Ruff
A lot of niggas that are wit us, ain't cried enough
So now when niggas come and get us, we fires em up

Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Motherfuckers, thought that the, X would stop
But I got niggas like, "Yo, who's the next to drop?"
From his camp, get the stamp, grand champ, it's official
Think when you die how many's gon' miss you
Lean over in your casket and kiss you
Send you on your way with a blessing
And pray that another learned a lesson
Smith and Wesson ended money's life, now money's wife's a widow
(Gave it to him full blast?) Nah dog, just a little
Beside rap I don't talk but make plenty of moves
I'll murder, ten of you fools before your men and them choose
You either, win or you lose, and I, love to win
Even if it means I gotta shed blood again
Keep the bank account doubling, but don't hate me
Really thought that what you said would either, make me or break me?
Knowin it don't take me long to write
Matter of fact, I think I'll drop another, song tonight

Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what34Embed
