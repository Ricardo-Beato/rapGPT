Yeah, yeah, what, yeah
Reminding me of Sef, what?
Fat fat thick booty, what?
You say jack that big booty, yo
He say OOH OH
I heard the boy he said OOH OH
The party people he said OOH OH
Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo
Check it, check it

Driftin' on a memory
Brought forth from a fifth of Hennessy
As in times of '89 they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually, broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes, this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggas be fuckin' girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin' over if he said, "Dumb bitch"
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin' the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin' lot
Unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin' off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

This reminds meeee... mmm whooahhh yeahhh
This remiiiiiiinds me... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh

Check it
Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
And start thinkin' they thugs
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion, so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin'
Saved my day, dancin' on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin'
Over gossip, Kenwood broads was pourin'
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
And Starter coats out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD I would quote Stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
Either go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin' like Vice Lords, down to the Taste
Not wantin' to bring my lady around crew 'cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
At 'em I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up

There go the break
To get the break go, it go OOH OH
Yeah, it go OOH OH
You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yo, check it, check it

Nowadays, niggas is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with 'em, 'cause they was born to trace
At times, I contemplate movin' to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline give me a warm embrace
Remindin' me of the pointed parties Moe used to make
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin' Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late, callin' broads, hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at, then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes, havin' bakeouts
We'd eat at Giordano's and break out
Then, everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin' and
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin' and
Tim'll be basin' Mike down at I.I.T
Rememberin' numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
My man Sef passed, I feel hollow but still
