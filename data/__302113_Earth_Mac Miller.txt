56 ContributorsEarth Lyrics
Yeah, you know I love havin' a studio at home
Because right when I walk in the booth
You know I, I take a sip of my drink
You know like, light a cigarette and walk up to the mic
And it's exactly the correct height for me
That really just makes me feel comfortable
You know, lets the mind be at ease
And I, I noticed that, that uh, sometimes I, I rap with my rollie on
And sometimes I take it off

You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you, and
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel, bring it back to Earth
Hi, I'm sitting in the clouds
Everything around seems different to me now
And this could be a change for the both of us
Get away from the world that's controllin' us
It's only just me, I hope you trust me
You look a little nervous, keep adjusting
Your blouse that you got on
The buttons come undone
Let me know if you need me to put a fan on
I stand on the floor, 'bout to collapse
The bliss turns to war, heart turns to ash
Fun turns to drugs, the idea of cash
Has taken away my mind
And I think that it's a sign that
Your beauty handed me my mind back
My conscious will attempt to dissolve
I do some shit I wonâ€™t remember at all
You might also like
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you, and
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel, bring it back to Earth

Ayy, what's up, A? Check in
Ayy, my eyes open (Open,) but I'm barely awake (Future)
They say my codeine purple (Purple,) and your beauty is ayy (Ayy)
That beauty takin' me away (Space,) I'm smokin' on that good Cali
I'm gettin' higher than Hollywood, get deeper than the valley
As you get lower than lowrider, your favorite ghost writer (Could be)
We jumpin' the gun (Gun,) I might go over beyond
Purchase a one-way ticket, don't know when you'll return (Come here)
I need to roll me a blunt, 'cause you done blew this joint (Ha)
They say the stars all line up (Line,) then they bring out the sun (Sun)
Hey, this a red carpet event (What?,) I'ma bring out that one
She so sophisticated, I brought her presidential rollies
I'm no longer faded (Ayy), she got me sober off of conversation (Turn up)
I'm no longer faded (Ayy), she got me sober off of conversation (Turn up)

You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you, and
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel, bring it back to Earth15Embed
