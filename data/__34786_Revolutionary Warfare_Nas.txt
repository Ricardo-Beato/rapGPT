(Uh uh huh, lets go, yeah!)
Uh, ghetto children singing (Singing, what up?)
See they eager to learn (Uh hum)
How to become the next world leaders, Bravehearts

Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here

Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but masterfully notice the weakness
In all them, gotta shoot only if necessary
Homie vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
When Aryan nations ain't having integration
We so blind, the beauty of life
Was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right
"Jesus", what is he like?
I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Gandhi was a fool
The chronic's a fool, got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out
You might also like
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here

My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's
I build with dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill in Dix Hills
For fishscale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef, I'll snatch your seed from Chuckie Cheese
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and AR-15s on the sofa
50 inch flat screen, Louie Vuitton holsters
My motions don't appeal to appellate divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler
Black gorilla, Crip and Blood in one nigga
Only killers know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton

Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to it's fathers
Protect the children, grab revolvers
The women plays important part of our life force
So what we fight for, my heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war
Uh, and listen more and talk less
Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient
Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
You ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in
Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
It's more to a war than just getting it on
Conceal your form, cover your tracks, stay prepared
I don't care if no one's spared in..

Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war
For the cause, I gotta take you off here3Embed
