47 ContributorsRaid Lyrics
I’m only in the company of kings
I made a power move and it’s everything it seems
Before 'Ye signed me, I was getting out my dreams
Standing on the shoulders of twenty-thousand fiends
Every time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit
Folks rush in, three letters try and stop it
F-B-I-R-S, D-E-A
One letter short but still motherfuck the DA
We play by the rules as they try to crack the code
Combination locks to the kilo’s that I hold
Leopard print Louboutins prowling the concrete
Rollerballs come alive just like Jumanji
You know where to find me
Greenhouse a circle of top whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any them top floors
35 large, took it right out the top drawer
Still got a throwaway phone in my sock drawer

It’s like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'Less he is an insomniac, he'll die in a dream
You might also like
You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered jelly donuts to taking them Os
From my high school sweetheart to fucking with hoes
Look, I’m all grown up and I done blown up
Nigga, ain't much changed; in fact, things are the same
I’m the definition of shooter, gun of choice, the Ruger
You’ll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I’m a magnet to murder, when I’m in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I’m bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I’m filthy
Drop Phantom is milky, white on white
24 inch blades, I'm skatin'
Red eyes, smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan
Nigga, surprise, 50 back on fire
50 back running round this bitch strapped, hitman for hire

It’s like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream, ugh!
I sit with the liars, duck tape and tiers
Been lost their soul, they just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shitload of priors
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep-sea dive for the fishscale
Tryna find a better price? Man, that ship sailed
Take a breath and head back if that shit failed
Drop weight like an anchor; then, you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine devil-scream when I turn the key over
Pirellis on the street rolling like a steamroller
Bitches double-team when I have my sleepovers
Yuugh! Re-Up Gang with the G-Unit
This is tailor-made, drug dealer theme music
Test it on your tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it

It’s like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'Less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream8Embed
