4 ContributorsOn Rich People LyricsI just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties
I want to help the world and I need help to do it. I am an artist and I care about humanity
Yes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family
But I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world
If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artist end up
Also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money
I could not have done the MSG without Adidas but world, what I'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what I will bring you
There are people who support artist and philanthropist
And I think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is
I am of service to the world with my art and I just want to serve more
I am ultra light beaming right now. So many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me
This is a God dream

No matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle
And a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators

People wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets!!!5Embed
