31 ContributorsFacts Lyrics
I can be walking and still run this shit
I can be sitting and still stand this shit
I can be sleep and still plan this shit
You can be Debo, who's gonna get the hit
You can keep the roses bitch it's guns & dreads
You can keep the fire hoses, when this gun get you wet
I gotta bankroll and it got 100s in that
I don't got a opinion, I got 100s and facts, yeah

Aye lil nigga where's the money
You thought I was a lil dummy?
I got association with money
These niggas be super corny
These niggas be stupid lying
These niggas is super funny
I ain't gotta wait in line, the doorman was waiting for me
Told that bitch you wasting time
All that talking ain't saying nothing
"Aye holmes why you got a 9?"
All that talk ain't spraying nothing
Bitch told me I blow her mind
She say she can't wait to touch me
But she's on another time
She say she can't wait to fuck me
I was riding down vine, going fast and sipping muddy
Sipping all this damn drank
I don't gotta piss or nothing
If you cannot fix your mouth my boys come through fix yo tummy
More Sosa, less Tony
You can come and meet my buddy
I'm riding with my buddy sipping muddy
Smoking stinky, bitches love me call my phone
Wanna fuck me, wanna touch me, wanna love me
Sosa ain't got time for lovey dovey

I can be walking and still run this shit
I can be sitting and still stand this shit
I can be sleep and still plan this shit
You can be Debo, who's gonna get the hit
You can keep the roses bitch it's guns & dreads
You can keep the fire hoses, when this gun get you wet
I gotta bankroll and it got 100s in that
I don't got a opinion, I got 100s and facts, yeah

I got 100s and facts, 100s and Mac's
100s and Tec's
I got 100s and 20s, 100s and 50s
I know that I got sauce but I don't eat spaghetti
Reese says I'm riding round with Ashley Spinelli
You like Pac up in Juice I be how Nas be in Belly
Got 15 for a show hell nah that's too petty
It's getting hot in here but I do not be with Nelly
I know I don't speak English bitch, all I speak is Fetty
I ain't never lackin' bitch all I be is ready
Yo bitch ain't tryna go she get that boot, call her Betty
I ain't finna call that bitch no Uber, call a Taxi
The Police hate Chief Keef, I swear they just wanna snatch me
They ran up in my house grabbed me, swear I wasn't ready
But Chief Keef ain't police If I could then I would blast em'
But the law won't let me judge gon try and give me 50
I can be walking and still run this shit
I can be sitting and still stand this shit
I can be sleep and still plan this shit
You can be Debo, who's gonna get the hit
You can keep the roses bitch it's guns & dreads
You can keep the fire hoses, when its gon getchu wet
I gotta bankroll and it got 100s in that
I don't got a opinion, I got 100s and facts, yeah5Embed
