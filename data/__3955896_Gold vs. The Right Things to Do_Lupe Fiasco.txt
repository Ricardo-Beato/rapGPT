61 ContributorsGold vs. The Right Things to Do Lyrics
Let me tell you 'bout the 'ting
Come sit 'round the fire
Me tell you where we come from
Me tell you the story

Some men wanna live like a banker
Fill up the ship then pull up the anchor
Pay the man dem to come run and take ya
Rassclaat chain in a brainwash nature
Joggin' in y'all clothes to the tailor
Drop leg to di riddim of the maker
Mash up di boat ah di fassyhole sailor
No rain a fall pon a Babylon acre
Zinc fence but me mind is a mansion
Dem a sufferer, we still have a bashment
Him inna cross but im still be a-dancin'
Every ting cook a curry like a champion
In a jam, but the man, him a jammin'
Original, you should come follow fashion
Me already dun seen what the future hold
Nuff gold for the dark hearts and the chasms
So big up your chest
Like a skin teet in a bad man wagon
No fear, me a duppy assassin
Make a wish me a dutchie Aladdin
Wah dem i-sire for dem earthstrong?
Give thanks to the first Gong
Di man word like a bird song
Iya self me a work pon (Fyah!)
Me gon tell ya bout the nation
Gravelicious men in them wicked navigations
Small up the slaves and stuff them in arrangement
We the children of the first generation

Fire burn (atat tat tat tat)
Babylon (atat tat tat tat)
Real mumma (atat tat tat tat)
Soon forward (atat tat tat tat)
Fire burn (atat tat tat tat)
Babylon (atat tat tat tat)
Downpressed (atat tat tat tat)
Jah bless (atat tat tat tat)

All I got is gold, golden memories
When I think about what you meant to me
All I got is gold, golden memories
When I think about what you did to me
When I think about, when I think about (reparation)
When I think about, when I think about
When I think about, when I think about
When I think about, when I think about (respect)

Man dem a come down from England
And dem wah commerce for your kingdom
Say 'em got nuff Manilla for the yute
And the gal and the man, would you bring some?
Tallawah and bashy, yuh sight me?
Say him don't want the likkle or the feisty
Say him got nuff bickle for the trip
Nah worry 'bout a thing man, everyone irie
Fuckery, mi nah wan' fi do it
And the samfie man wan mi fi trade pickney
For a quattie, baldhead must think me foolish
Me put a cutlass in this nuisance
Bwoi, wake up from your dream
To the smell and the sound and the screams
And the panic of the captain and the crew
Who don't know what to do as the ship comes apart at the seams
Got 'em, ship gets pulled to the bottom
By a group of men and women holdin' ropes with large hooks
On the ends specifically designed for catchin' boats
Crew in disbelief as they choke
The weight of the chains on the slaves
Pullin' down to what they think are they graves
Afraid as they sink from the surface of the sea
'Til a soft voice in the water tells them, "Breathe"
Fire burn
Fire burn (atat tat tat tat)
Babylon (atat tat tat tat)
Real mama (atat tat tat tat)
Soon forward (atat tat tat tat)
Fire burn (atat tat tat tat)
Babylon (atat tat tat tat)
Downpressed (atat tat tat tat)
Jah bless (atat tat tat tat)

All I got is gold, golden memories
When I think about what you meant to me
All I got is gold, golden memories
When I think about what you did to me3Embed
