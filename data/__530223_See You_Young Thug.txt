Hey (Rich gang)
YSL, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ayy, sheesh

I got the streets in a head lock (Hey)
I got your bitch in a leg lock (Hey)
I do not fuck with the fed cops (Hey)
F-150, I bed her (Skrt)
All of my niggas gon' get it (Rich gang)
We gon' bust it down and split it (Hey)
Fast food, I want the chickens (Hey)
Igloo, I pass the city (Gee)
I can see you in a Bentley (Skrt)
In the back like Oprah Winfrey (Woo)
Umbrella like Mr. Bentley (Hey)
My dick be stabbin' these bitches (Hey)
I'ma make it rain on her forehead (Sheesh)
Fuck you, pay me just like Uncle Sam said (Sheesh)
Ho, this ain't no fur this, a lamb head
You can't get the picture but the Cam did

Pull up in nothin' but big bodies (Hey)
On top like Scotty 2 Hotty (Hey)
Load up the fire then I light it (Hey)
Shootin' shit get me excited (Pew, pew, pew, pew)
Double C cups, fuck the titties, I try it (Ye, what, what?)
Ayy, iece of me inside her mouth call it trident (Sheesh)
Nigga havin' sex on a boat
I got my water on, I need me a float (Woo)
I am the black kid where is all my folks (Ayy)
I slimed them out then I left 'em on the shore
I got bands on me, yes, I meant plural
I am so fresh, man, I feel like I'm a tourist
And I want fifty whole bands for a chorus (Rich gang)
Every time I ball, bae, you know that I'ma score (Yeah)
Please take off them drawers, man, you makin' Thug bored (Yeah)
I'ma hit the show up and make a nigga flood (Woo)
Man, I wonder why all them niggas important (Why)
Man, my ice is water like a cosa nostra (Hey)
And swear to, swear to God, baby, I'm a big slime, already told you (Yeah), ayy

Off 'em, no reason, I kill 'em on spot at Four Seasons (Five star hotels)
Ice skatin' like Lupe Fiasco (Skr)
I'ma stack them hundreds tall, no Rango (Hey)
And I'm only 23 but I got stain though (Hey)
When we kill 'em we won't hold any remains though (Hey)
