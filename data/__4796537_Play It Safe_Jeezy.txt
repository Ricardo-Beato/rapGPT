Yeah, what's up? Uh-huh
It's 104, nigga, yeah
Never play it safe (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Girl, you got a lot of issues (Yeah, what's up?)
Like damn
Wonder why I ain't fuckin' with you
(Wonder why I ain't fuckin' with you, yeah, what's up? What's up?)
Oh, man
Know they couldn't walk a mile in these shoes
(Couldn't walk a mile in 'em, nigga, oh this that 104, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And the plan is not to let 'em trick you off your shit, ooh
We doin', is the future worth pursuin' or in ruin? (What's up? What's up?)
Swear I never play it safe, no

Yeah, the bigger the risk, the bigger the prize (Prize)
Yeah, I love her on top while I'm grippin' them thighs (Yeah)
Bonnie and that Clyde shit, we show up and we show out
Thug love in that backseat every time we go out (Haha)
Got her legs vibratin', yeah, I'm 'bout to catch a felony (Ayy)
Realer than her last man'll ever be (Young)
Real player shit, call me Young Bill Bellamy (Damn)
All about principle, a man of integrity (Ayy)
Yeah, chances make champions, against all odds
I'm an introvert, baby, (Yeah) stay away from them frauds (Yeah)

We doin', is the future worth pursuin' or in ruin?
Swear I never play it safe, no

I don't know (I don't know)
What you want from me (What you want, though, what we doin'?)
My eyes so low
It's so hard to see (It's hard to see, this that 104, though)
On my ride home (My ride home)
It occurred to me
I'm on my own road (On my own, baby)
And it's clear to see (It's all good, though, that's why I never play it safe)

Girl, you got a lot of issues
(Woo, what's up?)
Like damn
Wonder why I ain't fuckin' with you
Oh, man
Know they couldn't walk a mile in these shoes
(Couldn't walk a mile in 'em, baby)
And the plan is not to let 'em trick you off your shit, ooh
We doin', is the future worth pursuin' or in ruin?
Swear I never play it safe, no
What's up? Oh this that 104
What we doin'?
One thing about it, two things for sure
Three things for certain, baby
You never play it safe, huh
The bigger the risk, the bigger the prize
Chances make champions and shit like that
You know what it is
Haha, yeah1Embed
