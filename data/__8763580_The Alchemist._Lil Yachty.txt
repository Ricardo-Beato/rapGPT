No need to brag, but I knew that I was built for this
I know now that most men would kill for this
Seamlessly, I walk around infamous
Probably 'cause I am the alchemist
Learned to love, I'm not like the tin man
I am Sensei Jones with a vengeance
Reekin', reekin', ain't slept since last weekend
I don't think you practice what you preachin'
Sucker

It feels good
Don't mean no harm, this for shits and giggles
My taxes in on time
Alright, alright (On time), alright, alright, ah, ah
I'm living a good life
We living a good life

Bitch, we go super crazy for the backend
He know now that I give a back-hand
Back out on a boat, catch a spray tan
Ayy, man, off the drugs in the deep end (Tweak, tweak)
Ah, fuck (Tweak, tweak, tweak, tweak)
Papa made a young pimp, I'm outside
Southside, tote a shank, I'ma up rank
Lemonade pink seats in a fish tank

Up on my cloud
My feet don't touch the ground
Don't try to shoot me down
Only a human
It's my first go 'round in this thing1Embed
