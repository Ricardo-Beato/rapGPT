8 ContributorsMy Intentions Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

They been talkin' shit about me all day (All day)
So much that I paid it some attention ('Tention)
Bu they forgot the fact of one thing (One thing)
That maybe that wasn't my intentions
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh
That just wasn't my intentions

Yeah
Uh-huh, look
Damn, dog, I thought I was your man, dog
Us three together we had a plan, dog
Pardon me, I'm sippin' on this brown liquor
You know that shit that make you tell the truth quicker
You let them niggas in your ear like I was holdin' you back
Like it's the first of the month and I was holdin' your crack
U.S.D.A, nigga, yeah, you know the clique
We was supposed to change the world, nigga, me, you and Slick
Five hundred thousand sold, just to say the least
Billboard certified, golder than your teeth
Phil Jackson shit, yeah, I call that there a win
You should be happy, nigga, I just wanted you to grin
We on the same team, you in some type of competition
We got the same orders, but you on another mission
I know you wantin' a response, here it is, "Merry Christmas"
Still love you, nigga, I'm just gon' do it from a distance
You might also like
They been talkin' shit about me all day (All day)
So much that I paid it some attention ('Tention)
Bu they forgot the fact of one thing (One thing)
That maybe that wasn't my intentions
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh
That just wasn't my intentions

Main man, you know we had a game plan
Proud of you, homie, you a changed man
'Cause back then you couldn't stay out of trouble
Only made my anxieties and stresses double
I know you didn't peep that you was bringin' too much heat
Them indictments comin' down, I could barely even sleep
Yeah, Shawty Red was on the track, but I still had the pack
So you in and out of jail wasn't helpin' me relax
Plus, I didn't have the time 'cause I was runnin' out of time
Can't be dealin' with your bullshit when I'm dealin' with mine
They picked O Dog up, now I'm really paranoid
Moved everything the same day, my whole condo void
I know you heard it in my tone, collect calls on the phone
Guess I built resentment, nigga, you left me all alone
Voice box of the block, as loyal as they come
Speakin' of loyalty, you should've taught them niggas some
They been talkin' shit about me all day (All day)
So much that I paid it some attention ('Tention)
Bu they forgot the fact of one thing (One thing)
That maybe that wasn't my intentions
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh
That just wasn't my intentionsEmbed
