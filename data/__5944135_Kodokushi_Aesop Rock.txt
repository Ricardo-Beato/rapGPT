52 ContributorsKodokushi Lyrics
I shouldn't even be here, mum's the word
I burn down the house, I gum up the works
I'm the wrong vibration to summon to Earth
When the cuffs break, better make enough of the cure
I go proto-human, I'm so unruly
Architect of my Kodokushi
En garde, hop in the box of chopped arms
On the blocks beyond the pop art stockyard
Got a red phone right to the inside
I could turn a ribcage into windchimes
You don't wanna engage, kiddo, it's a burden to bear
It's a whirlybird, nervous in the surface-to-air
I lost count of the cooks, every coward and crook
Every memory or semblance of an, "Out of the woods"
I'm two unrubbed elbows well in the weeds
Even the good eye couldn't find the edge of my seat
Oh, potpourri of confusing powers
All mashed together and shooting outward
Intel gleaned from the prince of dark
Scarecrow every ten for infinity yards
When a spirit and vessel consider living apart
It's official, I ain't sign up for the mission to LARP
My call of duty stay all-consuming
Even if y'all see him as a dollar movie, look
Best in show, I'm the worst there is
That pest control is no urban myth
That floating skull just won't shut up
It's on a business trip from below the crust
Y'all know what's up
Bad news from the black lung
Used to flatline, the shit is so last month, yo
I don't need money to burn, I need sunsets, purple and mother of pearl, c'mon

No plea, no please, no defense
Don't creep in the deep end (Yeah)

Territorial organisms
Each glorifying our poor decisions
I'm a force, you could forecast swarming insects
Who eat all the corn like war is business
I pageant wave from my shallow grave
Patch me in from that astral plane
Ain't ring the bell, I pass through the walls
A cool burgundy in both tooth and claw
Midnight manage an incredible feat
A GPS collar on the neck of the beast
It go, beep-beep, any neck of the reef
Put a reaper on a second week of medical leave
I'm a seer, I could tell you how the curtain descend
Or maybe hint at how it isn't with a circle of friends
I go bah with the black sheep, rah rah, catch me a patsy
Spaz, unravel, and blaspheme
Riddler to keep the gate
It's a groundhog D-Day, Jesus H
I was born on a horse at a steeplechase
My forte's frontline real estate
Plus steak and frites, I take bloody as hell
If it burn black, point him at the honey and milk
I ain't sitting while you sully the well
I turn up in a jiff, jackknife when I jump in the pit
One hundred hands, one million eyes
Two bleeding gums, I will survive
That last line's rose-colored only for a limited time
It all shifts when you militarize
I had a vision of a feather on a seasonal wind
In the shadow of a gargoyle fleeing the brick
Lean in, steal your chips
Where I'm from, y'all wouldn't even be in the mix, ayy
I told ya
I told ya
There they come now, you see them (Yeah)
There they come now, you see them (Yeah)
I told ya
I told ya
There they come now, you see them (Yeah)
There they come now, you see them (Yeah)

I'ma need you to ease back
No peace out, flee to the evac
Don't be where you be at (Yeah)
I been looking for a reason to react (Yeah)
I'ma need you to reset
No plea, no please, no defense
Don't creep in the deep end (Yeah)
I been looking for a reason to see red (Yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah4Embed
