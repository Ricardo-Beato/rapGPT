7 ContributorsBlood on My Hands Again Lyrics
All you devils plotting on the god and on his throne
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again

From the darkest corners of the world with
(Demons, twisted suffering)
They tried to walk amongst the livin', corrupt the kings that
(Dreams of nothing)
They see the man in the shadows, lights a fire, lookin' for the one
Ridin' on the pale horse, blade and head (Death has come)
Fear the reaper when you see his face, in this case, you're lost
Wicked dreams of glory, tell me what your soul has cost
I'm the vengeance of the meek, with the hammer of the people
I'm the tip of the spear thrown by God (At the evil)
As I move upon the wicked through the mist with one objective
Send 'em back into the fire, then you gon' be resurrected
Sickened soul taken quickly from the shell (From the ruly)
Angels cryin' up in Heaven for the path that I have chosen

As the wind blows swiftly, fire rises in the night
With my blade takin' flight, souls are reachin' for the light
Your favorite beat, go 'head and get it
Tell 'em I'm the one who sent you
If the one who brings the rain and pose as evil that you men do
Heard the sounds of the trumpets blown, a king rises to the throne
God saved the king unless God wants me to bring him home
Stick the razor's edge in the light, my blade is clean
Until it's pressed against your neck, and now you're eternal dreamin'
You might also like
And only God could judge me for those things I had to clean away
The tidal wave, it came and washed every single thing away
And as I stray, lookin' for the day the maker makes a plan
I'll be lurkin' in the shadow with your blood upon my hands

All you devils plotting on the god and on his throne
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again
Blood on my hands again

Blood on my hands, hands, handsEmbed
