Oh yeah
G-G-G-Good work, Charlie

I got a problem, niggas out here tryna run with my style (Run with my shit)
You kiss your bitch, through work, I make her swallow my child (She sucking my dick)
We moving, shaking, working, now that money gon' pile (Yeah, yeah)
My ex be so upset because I'm balling right now (Oh yeah)

And you know I got that chopper like Osama, yeah (Woo, woo)
And that presidential Rollie like Obama, yeah (Like Obama)
