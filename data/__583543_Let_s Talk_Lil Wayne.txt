Let's talk it over now
Ahem
Let's talk it over now
Hey, princess
Yeah, you
Oh, baby
Streetrunner
Um

Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food
Knew I would score like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid, knew I looked like a big fool
I must have had the flu—I thought that shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me—what did I do?
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you
You knew all about me, baby
But you wasn't about me, baby, damn
Young Wayne, prepare for change
'Cause it seems like girlie don't care the same
You had my chain, you beared my name
Then, we had champagne
You might also like
Let's drink a toast
To you and me
Let's drink a toast to our love
And the way it's supposed to be, oh, oh, oh, oh

Other people telling me I fell off
Other people telling me—I felt y'all
Mama tellin' me I should at least call
My mind tellin' me, "She should at least call"
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seesaw
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seashore
But you got to let her be, boy
And when you open up your eyes, I hope you see more
And when I see you, I see detours
Don't need to be depressed anymore
Baby girl, I need more
Now, run your mouth 'til your knees sore

Let's talk it over, let's talk it over, let's talk it over now
Let's talk it over, let's talk it over, let's talk it over now
Let's talk it over, let's talk it over, let's talk it over now

Ugh, five karats on her finger, got her hand smitten
But everybody get a ring, even Scottie Pippen
Everybody got a thing, but I guess mine isn't
What my vision—
So I just sits in my Lamborghini, let my top vibe with me
Kick back and get high with me, chyeah
And if she still get me
I hope my wife know she got a player for life, and that's no bullshitting, heh
I push love to its full limits
Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called "Memory"
And I know you in that lane with me
But when the light changed, you didn't change with it
And now, I'm honking my horn
Got to get that dead grass off of my lawn
Yeah, as I mose' on
The champagne's never froz-on
As it pours on the floor
Let's drink a toast
To you and me
Let's drink a toast to our love
And the way it's supposed to be, oh, oh, oh, oh2Embed
