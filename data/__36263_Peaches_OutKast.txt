9 ContributorsPeaches Lyrics
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger, couple of kids in minivans
Standin' in the stands like a fan, watch her little man
Run ball... And every time you see the family they look happy
Got a mama and a daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had a cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the hide the spouse in the house
Boy its cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like
(Motherfucker, shit, goddamn asshole)
Took my shit (Beitch!) FUCK!

Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend
You might also like
It was the night that they done dipped
And all throughout the palace
Death didn't do us part, heart broke or no more marriage (Beitch!)
When it happens you'll be slappin' yourself rememberin'
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you're sittin' in the courthouse, plaintiff and defendant (Bitch)
Pleadin' to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin' was splendid see she was grinnin' and spendin'
All of her time wit the kids an' in the kitchen she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates damn I hate
Friction wishin' I had paperwork on the misses but I didn't
Damn... fuckin' around (Hey baby)

Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

Girl you have to remember
I gotta provide for the family and future
So please stay down and please stay around cause you know
That I'm tryna change but its hard cause I've been this way
(Man you already knew that shit)
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend2Embed
