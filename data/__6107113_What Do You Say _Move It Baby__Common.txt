9 ContributorsWhat Do You Say (Move It Baby) Lyrics
What, what, do you say to
Havin' one of them hell of a nights?
Move it baby
We can make it larger than life
Lead me baby
Yeah, yeah, need it baby
Won't beat around the bush like they do
'Cause I see somethin' special in you, yeah
What, what, do you say to
Havin' one of them hell of a nights?
Move it baby
We can make it larger than life
Lead me baby (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, need it baby (Ooh)
Won't beat around the bush like they do
'Cause I see somethin' special in you

Let free be between us, you my Medina
A queen like Amina or Fatima
Redeemer of passion, we both had compassion
For the Black diaspora and all its vastness
You in my plans, thinkin' of a master
The essence of your dance, the truth in your laughter
That I wanna capture and cultivate stature
I'll be here for you 'til the hereafter
There's a clear path to, to the love inside you
My name's Rashid, that means I'm a guide too
We both are driven, that's why we arrive to
A place where now anything we could ride through
To tell the truth, I lied and been lied to
Seeker of a deeper ether, you don't have to hide you
Time to be in front, time to be beside you
I don't wanna move with nobody besides you
You might also like
What, what, do you say to
Havin' one of them hell of a nights?
Move it baby
We can make it larger than life
Lead me baby
Yeah, yeah, need it baby
Won't beat around the bush like they do
'Cause I see somethin' special in you, yeah
What, what, do you say to
Havin' one of them hell of a nights?
Move it baby
We can make it larger than life
Lead me baby (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, need it baby (Ooh)
Won't beat around the bush like they do
'Cause I see somethin' special in you

In me you see a leader like Stokley or Mumia
The ways of a king, honorable and sincere
To get the people freed up
The soul of a rebel with his feet up
When it feel like the world about to erupt
I'ma hold you down 'til you see up
Optimism that we got from wisdom
We from the same tribe and we locked in rhythm
To de-block the system
We did lots of livin', and lots of givin'
A higher vibration but it's not religion
I wanna pour into the riches of your bein'
We don't diss each other even when we disagreein'
Let's two-step to freedom and help the world see them-
-Selves in God, and every human being
You everything and you happened for a reason
Your presence is a joy to be in, yeah
What, what, do you say to
Havin' one of them hell of a nights?
Move it baby
We can make it larger than life
Lead me baby
Yeah, yeah, need it baby
Won't beat around the bush like they do
'Cause I see somethin' special in you, yeah
What, what, do you say to
Havin' one of them hell of a nights?
Move it baby
We can make it larger than life
Lead me baby (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, need it baby (Ooh)
Won't beat around the bush like they do
'Cause I see somethin' special in you, yeah

What, what
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeahEmbed
