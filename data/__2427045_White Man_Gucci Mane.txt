3 ContributorsWhite Man Lyrics
I got a cup in my left hand, blunt in my right hand
I hid my drugs down a walk band, drunker than a white man
Drunker than a white man yea
Said I'm drunker than a white man, damn
Drunker than a white man yea
Drunker than a white man yea
Drunker than a white man, damn
Drunker than a white man, damn

I do more drugs than a rock band, party like a white man
I don't wear skinny jeans cause I got them damn bands
Strong in the mind but I'm good with my damn hands
Catch me in the hood with my nigga Pac movin' grams
I fuck with Black Migos gang, yeah Scooter my main man
I had to sign that nigga cause that boy can make cocaine
Them little boys no broken heads, got some shootin' no man
Then we so stuntin' fresh in here, how you say the same thing
Gucci Mane so diviner, I sell water to well
Yellow turtle to snail, front your boyfriend 30 bills
I drink lean no liquor baby, you can keep the biver though
They know your boyfriend locally but bitch they know me everywhere

I got a cup in my left hand, blunt in my right hand
I hid my drugs down a walk band, drunker than a white man
Drunker than a white man yea
Said I'm drunker than a white man, damn
Drunker than a white man yea
Drunker than a white man yea
Drunker than a white man, damn
Drunker than a white man, damn
You might also like
Party all night â€“ that's the party that I like
All these girls on that white, got these girls going hard
When I pull up to the light, I might a extra Sprite
Burn a blunt long way like a motherfuckin' knife
Yo I'm 50 for the head but 200 for the night
I leave the open for the room cause you wanted to spend the night
I'm a go bust your balloon, boy you muthafuckin' broke
You say Guwap going under, bitch you must be tellin jokes
Last hippie with the thunder and I look like 20 bands
Bust 20 fuckin bands to the Gucci Mane bitch
Made a half mill of the falcons, ain't gon motherfuckin' switch
But if I turn up 100K ya'll better motherfuckin' bleach

I got a cup in my left hand, blunt in my right hand
I hid my drugs down a walk band, drunker than a white man
Drunker than a white man yea
Said I'm drunker than a white man, damn
Drunker than a white man yea
Drunker than a white man yea
Drunker than a white man, damn
Drunker than a white man, damnEmbed
