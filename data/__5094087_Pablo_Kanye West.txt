Comin' from the blitz, turn to your ashtray
You can have a bad day
Pull up with a stick, three thou' shots, André
Top of the world, **** get starstruck, I just be oiled up
Calm my nerves, hangin' with narcos, shoot like vato
Bales at the loft, I can go golf, mmm
Flyin' out to New York, she do it with an arch
Rick James, drip on my cloth
Why must I explain? When I'm with my dawg, right or wrong
Who they waitin' on? That's Pablo16Embed
