Uh, yeah
It's that L.A. shit, Crenshaw and Slauson, 2003
Young niggas getting money for real this time
Ay

Look, summertime in that Cutlass
All these young hoes is fuckin'
All these young niggas is hustlin'
Pull up thick to that function
Pull out guns and start bussin'
'Cause niggas not with no fussin'
Roll up kush and shoot hunneds
And take your bitch like its nothin'
We was living fast, we was rushin'
Niggas burnt and crashed on that dumb shit
And it was fuckin' sad 'cause we was puppets
Had to learn so fast to switch hustles
And my bag, that’s $1200
And my fucking pad is illustrious
And I’d still kill one of you niggas
'Cause I’m not really for the fuck shit
And we was raised around hustlers
Rolex chains and K’s bussin'
Super Sports and boxed Cutlass
And pull off fast and burn rubber
Pull out cash like it’s nothin'
'Cause all these young niggas is hustlin'
All these young hoes his fuckin'
Summertime in that Cutlass

Summertime in that Cutlass
Summertime in that Cutlass

Summertime in that Cutlass
Roll up flight then get blunted
Thousand grams in that cupboard
If the police raid then we flush it
Murder case wit' no suspects
And all these niggas done got bust at
All these niggas they went and bust back
Make it hard to tell which one of us done what
As some young niggas we ain't want much
But if we was gon' have it, it was on us
Handouts, it was no such
Ten toes in some old Chucks
Beat loud but I’m low-cut
European clip grille when I roll up
Oh, fat Roley all gold, huh?
Let me squeeze ten shots, that’d be yo' luck
Look, talk money or I’m deaf
See niggas going broke, that ain't nothin' to respect
And I ain't tryna feel it so I do it to the death
1985 Cut dawg in the set
When I was fuckin' Courtney and Lauren, they was neighbors
And Car-Car told both of 'em, she was hatin'
But I ain't give a fuck, I been a young player
Push foreign shit now but remember them days when I used to spend a
Summertime in that Cutlass
