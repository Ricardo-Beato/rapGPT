20 ContributorsIntro Lyrics(O-U-T-K-A-S-T)

Live, from the center of the Earth
Seven light-years below sea level we go
Welcome to Stankonia, the place from which all funky things come
Would you like to come?
Bounce, baby. (We're bouncing!)
Bounce. Bounce. (We're bouncing!)
Two times: bounce, bounce. (We're bouncing!)
We're bouncing. (We're bouncing!)
Bounce. (We're bouncing, baby!)
(We're bouncing!) Come on, bounce
(Bouncing! Bounce, baby) Bounce!
Bounce, bounce. (Hey, baby!) Bounce, bounce
(Let's bounce) Come on, bounce. (Everybody let's bounce)
(Let's bounce) We bouncing now

All that bouncing... (Phsh)
Niggas ain't even from the A-Town
We got Bankhead right here, southwest Atlanta too strong
