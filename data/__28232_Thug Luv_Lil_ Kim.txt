9 ContributorsThug Luv Lyrics
Mm-hmm, ye-yeah..

Here come a bitch with the fly puss', and a nigga with the fly dick
In the Mickey and Mallory mode, rollin through the streets on 24's, on krunk screamin, "Die bitch!"
Bout to shut yo' shit down, anybody that opposes to payin us a fee false
If the straps don't bleed y'all, we put stitches in yo' motherfuckin dome like a league brawl
(Come and roll with this) Take a journey to the realm of the truth when I bust this, it's the Duke and the Duchess
Leavin haters 'buked and on crutches, niggas you cannot touch this
It's a new collaboration of Thug Luv, between the Thug Queen and the Thug Lord
More power than a drug lord, meant to be because we love each other the way we love war
Gotta rider bet hug yours, cause I'm full of ambition and ammunition and a 50 like I smoked a sticky stack of hash
Ain't no missin on no critical condition, murderin is the mission and we can bust a itchy atcha ass
Feel the flow when I drop it, don't when to stop it, I'm goin pockets and layin bodies down
Feel adrenaline from me and Kim and them, we got it sewed from Brooklyn to Chi-Town
See the artillery, we don't fuck around with silly games, plenty thangs
Nigga plus I got an illy aim, stick 'em up, steal his chain, then I spill his brain, then I feel his pain
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Queen, we gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

You can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us
You might also like
It's the T-W-I-S to the T-A, K to the motherfuckin I-M
Bout to shut yo' shit down, other albums come out ain't NOBODY gon' buy them
Now who gon' deny them? I'm scared of myself, don't nobody wanna try Kim
Y'all know you done fucked up (now whassup - y'all better come roll with us)
Who's you Mister? It's Lil' Kim and Twista (and we about this)
For those who doubt this, the game is ours (we gon' run you up out this)
What a wonderful feeling when you're stealin a million, but the billion jackpot's what I aim for
Get your hands in the air, put 'em up, keep 'em high, don't want no problems - JUST GIMME WHAT I CAME FOR!
Pull up on your block, eight straight Hummers, bout to have it locked, eight straight summers
Bank account hold eight straight numbers, ain't no room for you whack newcomers
We the people's choice because we kick that, Nasty "Hardcore" shit that you wanna hear
Can't fuck with us, hands down we win best murder rap of the year
Pounds to the misters, hugs for the miss, bombs in the mail, sealed with a kiss
All my bitches pop that thing like this, all my niggas wave that bling on the wrist
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Duke, we gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

You can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us

Kim is yo' flow hot? Like a gun shot Twist' is yo' flow cold? Well I think so
Kim do you got dranks Crist' by the box Twist' do you got smokes Well I got 'dro, now baby we can roll
Do it like a gangsta, creepin like a murderer, strapped while I roll on chrome
Lookin for the ones we at war with, when we see 'em we gon' aim for your dome

Hear me Ma we can run this Earth together, come up worse than ever
Havin big dreams while we back up this work together
Let's set up shop on the block now, takin over yo' tip, even if we gotta slang dubs
Go to war because I love blood, with a Queen by my side, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

Do it like a hustler, Lil' Kim and Twista, might as well ride with us
Nigga groupies, girl groupies, they're all gon' side with us
Whatcha gon' do, it's the Duke and the Duchess, you need to give it up
We gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

You can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us
