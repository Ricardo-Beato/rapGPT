Solid nigga, real street nigga
A hundred percent, a hundred and ten percent
Ain't no cut on this shit, nigga
This shit blue magic, nigga, like Frank Lucas, nigga, on God

Four trap spots at the bottom of the hill (Straight up)
Tryna diss Savage, that'll prolly get you killed (On god)
I'll get my shooter smoked, I think he finna spill (Swear)
The beans, I got X, dawg, 75 cents a pill (21)
Tez took a 15, finna come back on appeal (Free Tez)
Pop took 19 'fore he was 19, made me shed a tear (Free Pop)
Blew up on my own, no cosigns I was stiff (On God)
I swear I went like six times platinum 'fore I signed my deal (Straight up)
We used to cut MAK-90s 'fore they made them Dracs (On my mama)
I'm so Slaughter Gang, I'ma nut on her face (21)
Captain Save-A-Ho, you might get shot in your cape (On God)
Niggas drop a mixtape, then they tattoo they face (Lil' pussy)
Niggas drop an album, then pretend to be gangsta (Lil' bitch)
Imaginary hood, you gon' make it up, ain't you?
He done made up dead homies, man this nigga a prankster
I got niggas down the road for a flock, they'll shank you (On God)
Give me head in a brand new car (Yeah)
Hit her from the back, need Geico (21)
She got fat 'cause a nigga made her stay in the house so I got the bitch lipo (Straight up)
Ridin' 'round town with a Glock, but if it's a hit I'ma use my rifle (On God)
You can ask all the opps, niggas know 4L gang go psycho (I swear)

Cap-ass, rap-ass, battery-in-the-back-ass
You know you ain't built like that, play and get your ass smashed
All black ski mask, pull up on your street fast
Bodybag a nigga ass, throw his body in the trash
I'm a young trap ass, strapped-ass, no time for the yap ass
Get a nigga clapped ass, Zone 6, ride around with it in my lap ass
Leave your man's brain in your motherfuckin' lap ass nigga

Bow-bow-bow-bow-bow-bow-bow-bow
Brrr-bow-bow-bow-bow
I wanted to come in, know what I'm talkin' about
Cuz just talked that shit
That big Zone 6 shit for y'all niggas ass
(Stop all that cap-ass shit)

I'm a Zone 6-er, Mr. Remixer
Mr. Fuck-Her-Then-I-Hit-Her-Pass-Her-To-My-Nig-ger
Only thing I smoke on is a big Swisher
And I don't sip liquor, I sip lean, yes, sir
Pull up on the curb, hop out serve a nigga bird (Serve a bird)
Who run the block? Slimeball, that's the word (Slime)
Get a nigga topped, off top, non-stop, on my block
I got shooters totin' their Glock, it's a 30 in his Glock (Yeah that 30)
Niggas ain't rockin' how we rockin', we rock-solid (4L)
And I keep them blues in my pocket, ten thousand (Uh huh)
Five on your head, nigga, get your head chopped (Do that)
Ride through my hood and I got the top chopped (What?)
Off, when I ride off (What?)
Smoke gas, cough (Dude)
Bitch give me mouth (Uh-huh)
Big dawg, boss (Big dawg)
Y'all know what it cost (You know)
Just to be a boss (Be a boss)
Well, you gotta wipe some niggas off
You gotta run off on the plug
You gotta shoot at some niggas
Let 'em know you don't give no fucks
If you really 'bout that life, then, nigga, show 'em you 'bout your business
Don't be schemin' on a hunnid, nigga, run up you a million
Cap-ass, rap-ass, battery-in-the-back-ass
You know you ain't built like that, play and get your ass smashed
All black ski mask, pull up on your street fast
Bodybag a nigga ass, throw his body in the trash
I'm a young trap ass, strapped-ass, no time for the yap ass
Get a nigga clapped ass, Zone 6, ride around with it in my lap ass
Leave your man's brain in your motherfuckin' lap ass nigga (21, 21)

I was little, now I'm bigger (Now I'm bigger)
I was broke, now I'm worth eight figures (Eight figures)
It's either you against us or you with us (Lil' bitch)
Malcolm might get killed in the middle (On God)
Mini-14, I was 17 first time I shot it
Nigga, I was on Glenfair (On my mama, dawg)
Went hollow, Collier Ridge to VC
Robbin', landin', all the way to Line Street, they don't play fair (21, 21)
If you make your bed, you gon' lay there (You gon' lay there)
Made a hunnid on Austin off my cell, yeah (Off my cell, yeah)
It was a trap spot and I used to stay there (On God)
On my dead brother, I kept a K there (Straight up)
Tryna spend the night, you must be fuckin' or somethin' (Lil' bitch)
I want you to suck me like you suckin' your thumb (21)
Savage rich as fuck, but I save money like a bum (On God)
Made it to the top, but I give back to the slum (Straight up)
Cap-ass, rap-ass, battery-in-the-back-ass
You know you ain't built like that, play and get your ass smashed
All black ski mask, pull up on your street fast
Bodybag a nigga ass, throw his body in the trash
I'm a young trap ass, strapped-ass, no time for the yap ass
Get a nigga clapped ass, Zone 6, ride around with it in my lap ass
Leave your man's brain in your motherfuckin' lap ass nigga (21, 21)18Embed
