Yeah
Haha, yeah, niggas got jokes
Ten years, man, you and I gon' have matching Benzes (All the times)
Ten years? Nigga more like ten days (Always on my mind, yeah)
Ten days (Yeah, look, uh-uh)

Just to sniff them roses, you might miss the violets
Overly contentment just for somethin' more excitin'
Just to never find it (Yeah) like fuck it, never mind it (Nah)
I wear my heart out on my sleeve, I just refuse to hide it
Vulnerability, peace and the tranquility (Uh-huh)
I give it all I got and to the best of my ability, yeah
I take it day by day with grace and that humility
'Cause I done lived in way too much hostility
Fuck if niggas feelin' me or not, these just-just my shoes
Thirty thousand feet above the block, this just-just my view
Bitch, I ain't got shit to lose, please don't make me lose my cool
I ain't got shit to prove to you, 'cause this ain't nothin' new
What more do they want from me? (What?) Demons, they been hauntin' me (Yeah)
Satan tryna offer me a deal that's gon' be hard for me to say no (Fuck)
Battlin' these evils, it's a struggle every day though
Bitch, I'm finna die about it, where the fuck my halo? (Bitch)
Surrounded by my angels (Right), they cover every angle (Facts)
Back up on my feet and now the Devil tryna tango (Yeah)
Sometimes the pot of gold is the rainbow (Sometimes it is)
I said, "Sometimes, the pot of gold is," fuck it

Long as the wheels keep turnin' and fire keep burnin'
Then you know us real niggas don't stop
Long as the world keep spinnin' and my girl keep grinnin'
Then you know we gon' make it to the top
We just wanna be loved, oh
We don't wanna be judged
We wanna be accepted
Never wanna be neglected
We just wanna be loved

Look, uh
My nigga just left the pen' and he been tryna get back on his feet
His father died, he was inside, said the cancer beat 'em
Baby momma playin' hide and seek with his lil' legacy
Allegedly she fuck with some lil' nigga that's 'bout to wedding ring her
PO on his ass, he can't have so much as a misdemeanor
Or he goin' back, he doin' bad so he been heavy drinkin'
Show him love for Heaven's sake but I don't know what the hell he thinkin'
A cycle that we gotta break or we just run in place
One hand could wash the other, both hands could wash the face
I'ma stand beside my brother, take the stand and fabricate
Make sure that you good, you need a hug, you need a handshake
Nigga back in the hood, he need some money so he antsy
And he buggin' and thuggin', name buzzin' in the city
With the safety on the semi like Xavier McKinney
Giant world, niggas' mind too mini
Ain't too many minorities seen the possibilities
Dodgin' enemies, mind jittery, lookin' to find an identity
Niggas be flodgin', niggas be finicky, I hope you try to forgive me
If you gon' ride with me then ride with me, got a Glock-9 and God with me
Gotta watch mine, keep eyes with me at the stop sign
Long as the wheels keep turnin' and fire keep burnin'
Then you know us real niggas don't stop
Long as the world keep spinnin' and my girl keep grinnin'
Then you know we gon' make it to the top
We just wanna be loved
We don't wanna be judged
We wanna be accepted
Never wanna be neglected
We just wanna be loved

Blessings come like one-and-one, baby
But you crossed my mind
We all pressed for time
I think now's the time
Why you act so hard to find, baby?
It blows my mind
This might define crazy
I be losin' my mind, baby4Embed
