Hey
Hey (I’m da man)
Hey (I’m da man)
I’m da man
I’m da man
I’m da man
I’m da man

I’m da man
Rubber band man, I’m the Son of Sam
We want you, come on down
Call us dear hunters, cause we buckwild
I got weed up in the basement, money on the couch
Get a new fan, got a new heater
Two hundred thousand dollar cars with a two seater
Pull up grab some more money and a 2 liter
And I'm so fucking hot, that I ain’t cool people
Old money, new shirt
Lil limp in my step like my shoe hurt
Eating all this green, abscess, now my tooth hurt
Use a little , you'se a bluebird
Climbing on the wall just like a spiderman
I’m here to fix the pipes, with my pipe in hand
I am here to fix the stoves, with my wrench in hand
I count blessings just like how I count dividends
New money, new weed
New shoes shit costs me 2gs
New cologne, thousand a squirt
You can’t get no connection, cellular service
Gonna get that cash, you’ll ride around
And it's pouring down, Thanksgiving going ham
Sipping all this fuckin' slow motion, you can slow it down
Pull up on you like we heard complaints, a nigga lower it down
Pussy you'll know if you seen a fly you won't blow it down
It's my weight heavy pick your ass up and I'll throw you down
I got new money and you’s a new you
You so fool fool
And I smoke two two!
