7 ContributorsSo Cool Lyrics
Y'all let um know
I'm the coldest MC Joe you dig

So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool, so cool

I was raise in city where the blood is cold
Big hats Cadillacs and we love some gold
Looking for something real something pretty to hold
I'm king so I wrote livid imperial souls
I can tell you one them undercover video hoes
The way you shake I might just give you a role
Radios TV stole the soul
Now these playa's in the game really don't know they role

So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool
So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool, so cool
You might also like
You tryin' to look real sexy
You wanna get some lovers
You know your stomach's too big
For you to be wearing them hip hugger
You need to work it out work it off juke it out
And use your mind the way you use your mouth
I'm from a stripper hustler with names like Chip and Buster
Come to the crib with that bogus
Them boys will nip and tuck ya
Are you a righteous brother
Still I might just touch her, build her and destruct her
Come with heat that'll burn like Usher

So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool
So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool, so cool

Rockin' don't stop it now, uh
Rockin' don't stop it now, uh
Shock it don't stop it now, uh
Shock it don't stop it now, uh
You can keep freakin' now, uh
You can do the freak girl
So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool
So cool, so cool
I wanna move
So cool, so cool1Embed
