6 ContributorsOut The Roof Lyrics
If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
Campaign so strong everything true (migos)
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof
If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
Campaign so strong everything true (migos)
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof

We throwing out the money out the roof like ceiling ain’t got no top
We throwing money out the roof migos got that guap
We Pouring up that 4 that double cup that Kevin
I’m a nigga that skateboard grind that kick flip money Tony Hawk
Loud pack taste so ? my bitch kick back yo bitch ugly
We pull up in the club sippin’ color purple like ?
Blue chevy like took it pockets on snooki
People takin them pictures they watching like movies

If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
Campaign so strong everything true (migos)
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof
If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
Campaign so strong everything true (migos)
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof
You might also like
If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that M I D
If yo ass ain’t fat baby I can’t talk to you
If the grams don’t weigh out right then I can’t fuck with you
If that pack ain’t smelling right i can’t shop with you
If it ain’t 50 or more a show then I can’t do a show for you
If I ain’t fuckin’ bad hoes its a sin, if I ain’t rocking designer clothes its a sin
Free my niggas in the pen, bless my niggas in the pen
I know one day when they get out they say they say they never do this again
But how they hell we gone eat, how they hell are we gone eat
Throw 100s out the roof white folks say thats a felony
I’mma keep thuggin, thuggin, Bitches show me love
Off in the club throw a hundred in the club
Yeah niggas mean muggin
I don’t really give a damn, I don’t really give a damn
9 on my waste and new clip when I jam

If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
Campaign so strong everything true (migos)
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roof
If you got that loud pack I wanna shop with you
If you got that mid sack don’t wanna shop with you
Campaign so strong everything true (migos)
We got them stupid racks throwing out the roofEmbed
