48 ContributorsAll Around Me Lyrics
Lex Luger on the beat, so what the fuck you think

I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight
They tryna down me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause if my homies eatin', I'll always be straight
They tryna clown me
But I got blinders on and I see nothin' but the money in my face
Look all around me
The homies good and the home girls better so it's time for a toast

I made it far so I'm thankin' God
I do not go to no bars, I'm in the car with the stars
I can't pull up, I can't park if it ain't valet
I'm in Houston with a bitch and her friend, she gay
She don't suck dick, but tonight it's all in her mouth
I just fucked a bitch who supposed to be my godsis
I'm so dirty, I'm so fucked up, I don't give a damn
And if you owe me, I need taxes like I'm Uncle Sam

I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight
They tryna down me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause if my homies eatin', I'll always be straight
They tryna clown me
But I got blinders on and I see nothin' but the money in my face
Look all around me
The homies good and the home girls better so it's time for a toast
You might also like
Tell me how it's supposed to go
My swag is on overload
But Lil Yachty, now row your boat
They know us, we don't know them hoes
Got my homeboys, got my homegirls
Fuck these haters, I keep living in my own world
I get money, I flip money on my own tours
Own my coupe, skrrt, skrrt, you don't own yours
Champagne in the sky just to toast up in it
Dubs up high, rep the coast up in it
Deuce deuce, two two, go and add both digits
Woo, woo, I had to bring the 4 up in it

I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight
They tryna down me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause if my homies eatin', I'll always be straight
They tryna clown me
But I got blinders on and I see nothin' but the money in my face
Look all around me
The homies good and the home girls better so it's time for a toast

Ayo, I fuck with Lil Yachty, I fuck with Lil Yachty
I don't roll too much broccoli but I fuck with Lil Yachty
I told Lil Boat get your money and fuck these hotties
Don't worry about these niggas, your shit poppin' every party
Yeah I started from the bottom, the low
I put homies on fo sho
Don't pat me on the back, no
'Cause that's what I'm supposed to do
I don't need no back pay
Nigga I'm a real nigga
I just want you to say I'm good when I ask you what's the deal with ya, rare
They don't make them like that no more, rare
Pull up every homie in a foreign, that's rare
I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight
They tryna down me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause if my homies eatin', I'll always be straight
They tryna clown me
But I got blinders on and I see nothin' but the money in my face
Look all around me
The homies good and the home girls better so it's time for a toast1Embed
