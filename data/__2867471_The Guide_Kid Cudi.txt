Ain't the type to let you tell her what she needs
Ain't gon' sit or stand around
A lethal love, I leave 'em sick, mamacita on me
No, one touch is never allowed
She said, "What do you want, what do you want, what do you want?
What do you want, what do you want, what you want, what do you want, what do you want?
What do you want, what do you want, what do you want, what do you want, what do you want?
What do you want, what do you...?"

Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? (Yeah)
Where you going? (Are you sure? Alright)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I need a winnin' woman, a Wonder Woman
A Gal Gadot, sophisticated and hot (Uh)
She knowing what she doing, like the music here
When she step on the scene she could light up the block (Uh)
Sittin' all, took her, make her awesome
Civil hearts hid them whole love back in a custom
Ain't too many women, I know
Who could look at your soul, just from lookin' at you
I heard she got these niggas fallin' at her feet
She kneels to no one with her golden crown
You'd be the one to b-bow
You'd be the one to b-bow
Have mercy on me, put some magic on me
Be my guide in the dark (Uh)
Have mercy on me, put some magic on me
Be my guide in the dark, guide in the dark

Where you going? Yeah
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

So when did we become so sophisticated and smart
And tryin' so hard that we forgot that we were animals?
But never her, I never heard a creature make such sounds
It never would occur to people her up-downs
Convertible, would murder evil, pup-pup hounds, just been doggin' her
Courtesy and real love found, just been dodgin' her
Mr. Man, misogyny hands been massagin' her
If she ran and blew up her town, shit, I would pardon her
Put a part in her scalp, scratch her dandruff
Put her heart in your hand, she throw a tantrum
Better let her get that shit off, bug repellent
Hell, they've been telling her "Nah" since forever
Harold Melvin and some Blue Notes all she know
Murder, murder, murder, m-murder all she wrote
Perverted, she prefer to be hurted, claw her throat
All the dirty verdicts she learned watchin' soaps, yeah

Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? (Yeah)
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Semi-automatic with the passion when we makin' love
Never made it to the bed, sexin' on the living room floor
Now she on the warpath, homie probably best that you don't piss her off
Got this woman on the prowl, on the hunt, she gon' eat 'em all
And she know what she lookin' for, know what she lookin' for
She said she got herself some Louboutins, got herself some Louboutins
Not indecisive, indecisive at all
She know what she lookin' for, got her some Louboutins

Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? (Yeah)
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh14Embed
