4 ContributorsLost Souls (Nu-Mixx) Lyrics
'Cause I hate to spend
My life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time! (Lost Soul)
How it start? How it start?

Started off with, runnin' from coppers
Duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us?
Livin' the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' 25 to life, if the judge don't like us
Am I clear as pictures? I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF, state feds, scandalous bitches
How was it promised to us? Was it bitter or sweet?
See if a, nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat
On these streets livin' do or die, circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for G's
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin' Thug Life, comin' equipped, with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time; stranded in the county in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost souls...
Lost souls, nigga, for my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a lost soul
You might also like
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Roll wit' it, nigga; roll wit' it, nigga

My brother Sean, first on my list, he came home
Went back in and came back home again
And he just violated parole
Now Uncle Sam wants the time he owed
Back to the system, Black and trapped in a prison
I miss him, it's just my brother don't listen to nobody
He hardheaded, stuck in his ways
Won't change for nobody, all I could do is pray for him
And I'm praying for myself
Trying to beat the odds with the cards that we was dealt
Young niggas need help, the suicide rate is up higher than ever
Rest in peace to granny, send my love to KRS and the family
We need to try to make it through the struggle as family
They say rapping don't pay them bills
Trappin' gon' pay them bills 'cause this ain't how we tryna live

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
One time, one time, one time
I've been waiting on the rain to turn to sunshine for a long time
Stuck up on this grind, still want mine
Lost a couple homies, miss some comrades
But ain't no looking back when you gotta keep it crackin'
Just had another birthday, guess I'm lucky
Triple 7's, mama's still here to hug me
My baby on the way, she need a whole lot
She gon' get what she need, that's on pops
I used to love the shit, but man, the shit changed
It's a shame, niggas paid to be lame
But, uh, some of the realest, some people give it up
Lost souls around the world looking for love
I'm forever thuggin' on them hoes, right or wrong
Thug life embedded in me 'til I'm dead and gone
It's in my heart, in my flesh, in my soul
I used to be lost but now I know

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time

All of y'all, keeping y'all in health
