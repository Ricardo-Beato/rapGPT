2 ContributorsStrip Club Interlude Lyrics
Y'all know what I'm still missin' my baby
He's still in New York workin' on his music
You know what I'm missing mine too I was supposed to be in Vegas right now for the Magic show, only reason I flew back to Atlanta is because they said Gucci Mane is supposed to be in Onyx
They called me all the way in Vegas girl, told me Gucci Mane is supposed to be in- he's coming here at nine?
Yeah, he's supposed to be here all up for the radio and everything
His boy called me and said they was doin' something
Whatever he ain't gonna spend no money
Yeah, but
He shows love, all the time
Tell Gucci Mane to throw me a Gucci purse with some ones on stage, how about thatYou might also likeEmbed
