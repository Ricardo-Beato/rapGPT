29 ContributorsEye For An Eye (1994 Session) Lyrics

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mine
So long as the sun shine can light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mine
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mine
So long as the sun shine can light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mine

First of all the foundation, money is the root of all evil
The cream will have you shitting on your people
Living like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothing changed but the clothes that my money bring
I'm Making figures that I never thought was possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of Tec-xuses and the Mac-uras
Kid you'll get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been trying to blow for years
Getting bent off MoÃ«t, spending a G on beers
Living life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet
Til the coke oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you looking, you can find me rising to the top
I'm a classic, approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic
Im trying to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team died
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky
While the rest still living steady telling me lies
It's like a bad dream and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up
You might also like
I got your life in arms reach, With a slug for each and any
The clip is filled up I'm hitting til its fucking empty
Presenting, the hollow tip crew, take heed to the message that we sending at you
Choking off your own blood watch you face turn blue
Ain't that some shit, the damage that a bullet can do
Make you change the way you thinking, niggas speed while you blinking, too late
On your way home, you left a trail leaking
I bet you next time you'll listen up while I'm speaking
Now you're laid up in ICU for the weekend
At the same time I'm outside getting my thug on
The same eyes got my mind fucking bugging

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mine
So long as the sun shine can light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mine

A drug dealer's dream:
Stash CREAM, keys on a triple beam
Five hundred SL green, ninety-five nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend
Murdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring
Shank is serving 'em, what's up to all my niggas swerving in
New York metropolis, the Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds feels like, the holy beast is watching us
Mad man my sanity is going like a hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar moving all your weak production
Pumping corruption in the third world we just busting
My teams hot collecting mad cream, we slingshot
My ring's rock icy like a fuck with a green drop
Call me santa with more snow than montana
Camouflage Wu emblem on my bandana
Play fair sight, never in a million these cats bite
Folding under pressure like beach chairs
Drug money, hundred dollar nights plus flights around the way
Burning biggys on bikes its only right
Two for fives 95, five 25s didn't I
Rewind glaciers mixtape niggas throwing eyes
Check dates, my whole crew making they Tec's spray
Shooting ninas off sideways we know it

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mine
So long as the sun shine can light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mine
Beat downs galore, kids walk away holding they jaws
Wishin they had yours, tours posters plus sneaker stores
Balls be gettin licked kid on whatever airline
Restroom style courtesy from stewardess, the bitch washed mine
Shellbox nines never been popped, Knowledge Bill shots
Israelis be hittin me, Bing's death made the store hot
Jewels gleam, niggas beam, whole team labelled wally king
Goldie brought a pair, Chinese man dot him with the green
World's greatest, Las Vegas payed us, rap crusaders
Casino champs, Gods sport the latest
Today's math, fuck nuthin but ass, take Cristal baths
Go half on his robbery, we run up on Johnny Cash
Kid's invicible, back to back screws, Wu's suspenseful
You get lynched, starks will play it cool like a mint
Like a night out, whitey's callin me like a double date
Alkies get the shanks, yo it's swine inside Hostess cakes
Yo my man, check the moral or get deaded
You bust a shot and that big bullet was unleaded
Word up
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mine
So long as the sun shine can light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mine4Embed
