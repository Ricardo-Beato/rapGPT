21 ContributorsAinâ€™t Trippin Lyrics
My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin (I ain't trippin ho)
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I swear, swear to god, Quan ain't trippin
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

I want to seal it
These bitches wanna fuck us, we the realest
Like it or not, brain shoot to the ceiling
So many clothes in the closet, she looks like dealer
Ran up my racks with Rich Homie we're like the pilgrims
Pour out 4 of that super clean (lean, lean)
I got jelly beans in my billie jeans
I got Quan back cause I know he got my spleen
You might also like
My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin (I ain't trippin ho)
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I swear, swear to god, Quan ain't trippin
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

Dad told me never trip about no bitch
Daddy told me to stay down and they're gonna lose
Granny told me pray to God, that's what I did
Gotta make a way for my kids
Me and Thug flying higher than a blimp
Eating on shrimp, looking down at the shrimps
If you see me with a limp, don't mistake me for a pimp
The 40 get heavy when you tote it on your hip
Me and Thug ready, going in for the kill
And Imma look confused
My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin (I ain't trippin ho)
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I swear, swear to god, Quan ain't trippin
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

Got racks on racks on racks
I got zippers on all of my shoes
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin (pussy nigga I wanna be you, psych)
Diamonds black, I'm a walking night
Play with Thugger, scary sight
No shoestrings in these shoes, so I ain't tripping
I ain't worried bout shit, cause I got zippers on all of my shoes
My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin (I ain't trippin ho)
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I swear, swear to god, Quan ain't trippin
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin7Embed
