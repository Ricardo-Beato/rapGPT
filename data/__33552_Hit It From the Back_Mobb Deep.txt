From the back— From the back— (Uh)
From the back— From the back— (Yeah)
From the back— From the back—
From the back— From the back— (Word)
How we hit it
From the back— From the back—
From the back— From the back— (Check it out)
From the back— From the back—

Shorty, don't front, you better act like you're with it
Frontin' like you never did it, bitch, admit it
Matter fact, shut the fuck up and turn around
If you still got walls, I'ma tear the shits down
Just one of few brothers vigorous with the dick
Prepare to stay long 'cause I don't cum quick
Little or big, I tear that ass out the frame
Talkin' like you're ill, but the shit is all game
You're weak on top, you can't ride like a stallion
Hit it from the back, then I'm Audi 5000
But if you're ill, we can chill, smoke a fat Phil'
A little somethin' just to make shit real
Off with the light, fuck an invite
Just make sure you don't got your period 'cause I don't run red lights, alright?
You know my motherfuckin' steelo
Rippin' from the back, bitch, you know how we go
You might also like
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back (Like that)
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back (Like that)

Uh, know what I'm sayin'?
Check it out, word is bond
Know what I'm sayin'? We gon' flip it like this
Rink-a-dink, rink-a-dink dinky-dink

I used to hit raw daddy, but now I carry packs of three
Bulletproof, I refuse to let the monster get me
I'm in, hit it from the back like that
Shorty Black never tap no skins that look whack
I got mad game like Twister, nasty little mister
Quick to talk dirty to a sister
I met the shorty at the Skate Key
What's her name? Never mind, 'cause she might try to sue me
Juiced her up, took her to the projects
So, uh, if she was cookin', maybe we could have sex
You know what happens next (Next) drop to your knees (Knees)
Bitch caught a bonus head spin, I win (Uh-huh)
As she starts to proceed, she said she wanted me to drop a seed (Nah)
I told her, "Parlay and just be" (Word is bond)
The cunt little stunt with my butter dick, shorty
You talk too much, so lay back and enjoy the blunt
I put it in her, she starts to wild
She said, "Slow down," I said, "This is shorty wop style"
A versatile rough sex, fuck love makin'
Flip the script, shorty, and flip yourself over
On your hands and knees, Cochise, from the back
I don't shoot blanks and I'm out, Black
Hit it from the back (Yeah), hit it from the back, hit it from the back (Like that)
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back (Like that)
Hit it from the back (Yeah), hit it from the back (Yeah), hit it from the back (Like that, word)
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back, hit it from the back (Yeah, like that)

Uh
Woo
You know what I'm sayin'?
From the back
I like that
I like that

Shorty, don't front, you better act like you're with it
Frontin' like you never did it, bitch, admit it
Matter fact, shut the fuck up and turn around
If you still got walls, I'ma tear the shits down
Just one of few brothers vigorous with the dick
Prepare to stay long 'cause I don't cum quick
Little or big, I tear that ass out the frame
Talkin' like you're ill, but the shit is all game
You're weak on top, you can't ride like a stallion
Hit it from the back, then I'm Audi 5000
But if you're ill, we can chill, smoke a fat Phil'
A little somethin' just to make shit real
Off with the lights, fuck an invite
Just make sure you don't got your period 'cause I don't run red lights, alright?
You know my motherfuckin' steelo
Hit it from the back, bitch, you know how we go
Hit it from the back (Hit it), hit it from the back (Hit it), hit it from the back (Like that, from the motherfuckin' back)
Hit it from the back (Hit it), hit it from the back (Hit it), hit it from the back (Like that)
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back (Strictly back shots, that's the way I love to hit it), hit it from the back (Like that)
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back (Shorty, don't front, you better act like you're with it), hit it from the back (Like that)

Strictly back shots, you better act like you're with it (With it, with it)
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'? Just buggin' out (Word up)
Stupid bitch, from the back, word up
Uh-huh
Check it out
Check it out
What we gon' do is flip it like this, check it, that's how we do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh
