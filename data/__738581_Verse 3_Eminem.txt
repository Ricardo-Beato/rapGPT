4 ContributorsVerse 3 Lyrics

It's like this and like that and like this
It's like this and like that and like this

I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners, looking for hookers
To punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr. and smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die nowYou might also likeEmbed
