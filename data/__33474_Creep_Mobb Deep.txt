18 ContributorsCreep Lyrics
That's that creep
Creep mode baby, we in creep mode
Don't come around here baby
Shining like that, yeah

It's crazy on this side, come through, gun through
Oh, ya man live out here? Don't go and get comfortable
Don't know what he told you, ain't sweet around here
And I don't care what he told you, ain't sweet around here
See you riding that Infinity, now that's not fair
What's that, a 2006? Okay
Playboy we got balls that ain't made all day
You comin' through the hood, straight dangling state, yeah
We takin' medium-rare, grilled debatin us
Lettin' that slide's not up for debate
Oh you met, you a local guess what she bait
She don't know right now but trust me the bitch bait
I won't get all in the business, cause shorty is mad cool
My man was diggin' at and she a lil' bit national
First time we catch you comin' out the building, we snatchin' you
And takin' what's yours, first thing we ask you is

Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like you somebody lookin' like the player of the year, boy
Fuck brought ya ass around here
This is Queens lil' homie, get caught around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Comin' through for these bitches, shit happen around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like niggas got somethin' to live for around here
You might also like
You ask me, all these rappers is bums
Hav showed me the flow and I ran with it, thun
I mean really, y'all got to be the most worst
Rap shit I ever heard compared to P verse
We emerge on the scene, everything seems
Stop, watch is very bling bling
Nigga wanna swing swing, very much so
But once we get in the air, that's a wrap, bro
Our songs good to go straight to the radio
Flex, easy on the bomb, let these niggas hear to flow
We America's most dangerous to have fans
New York, New York, we the kings of the dam
We party too much and smoke too much grass
And we never see the bright side, we only see the bad
Fuck all that, it's a lot of niggas dead
And I won't let 'em get me how they got them

Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like you somebody lookin' like the player of the year, boy
Fuck brought ya ass around here
This is Queens lil' homie, get caught around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Comin' through for these bitches, shit happen around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like niggas got somethin' to live for around here
Yeah, cock that, aim that, squeeze that, shoot the steel
Cadillac Coupe DeVille, wood grain on the wheel
Cocaine in the pot, baking soda, water hot
When the ice cubes drop, look at that, that's crack
Bag that, nigga stack, black hoodie, fitted hat
Grimy nigga with a gat screamin' "Where the money at?"
My hood Southside, riders ride, that's right
Yayo he know, Banks know, Buck know
Shit it ain't about the dough, I ain't really with it yo
Camouflage on the low, ridin' round with the heat
I ain't say wassup to you, nigga you don't know me
I'm on the grind all the time, heavy shine and a nine
Clip filled 'til the tip, stunt I get on some shit
Different day, different bitch, old hooptie, new kicks
Oldsmobile, fuck that, no rims, hubcaps
Keep my eyes open for them niggas I done bucked at

Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like you somebody lookin' like the player of the year, boy
Fuck brought ya ass around here
This is Queens lil' homie, get caught around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Comin' through for these bitches, shit happen around here, yea
Fuck brought ya ass around here
Like niggas got somethin' to live for around here1Embed
