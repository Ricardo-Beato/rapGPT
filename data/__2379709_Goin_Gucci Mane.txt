9 ContributorsGoin Lyrics
When I went to Lennox
20 grand in every pocket
That's like 80 wit me
Spent like 30'Grand in Louis ain't been 20 minutes
Parked my Rari in the same place that they park the Benzes
(Laughter)
Haters I despise
Take My glasses off so you can look me in my eyes
They Go for 30 well Gucci gotem for 29
Blue and orange vert same color Auburn
And Imma call my plug and tell'em bring me all'em
All the niggas in the hood call me Pablo
I got that kush comin in by the car load
Count a hundred thousand dollars up in Carlo
Since I'm am baller I ain't taking nothing smaller

50 thousand dollars on me because I love me to death
Spent so much on champagne, spilled champagne on myself
Still Goin x6 I'm goin goin
Three thousand a room, I'm one hell of a man
He can't beat it up, well I bet you I can
I'm still Goin
X6 I'm goin goin
You might also like
It's so hard for me to dance with this pistol in my pants
I got bricks all in my truck
I got bales all in my van
Audemars on my left wrist
You should see the diamonds dance
You should see these bitches throw it
Twistin' they ass up how they stand
Sellin' white all night that's all I do
Money stacks as tall as you
Fuckin' broads like ballers do
You broke and thats whats wrong with you
I got a Bentley in my pocket, hard to keep my britches up
Better go play with your kids
You don't wanna play with us
Hold up for a second, can I talk for a minute
Audemar on every time I handle business
Worth 90 thousand if I took the diamonds out it
Keep the diamonds in it's like clean two hundred thousand


Wet diamonds in the morning when I'm cooking my eggs
Count 100 thousand then get back in the bed
I'm a trapper and a rapper I don't get no recognition
Cause I juggle two jobs
Flip verses and chickens
My day starts with a play
200K worth of cakes
I got the best of the best
That real Colombian flake
50 thousand in my britches when I come out today
I might go out and play
Drop top Porsche and it's grey
I'm disgusting with these diamonds need to work on my manners
Missmatched outfit three different designers
Man my pinky ring so bright you can see it from China
And I ain't even have to tell you that the kid is a grinder
