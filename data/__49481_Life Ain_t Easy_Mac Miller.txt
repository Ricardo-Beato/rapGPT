24 ContributorsLife Ainâ€™t Easy Lyrics
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy (Nothin' easy)
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe me

Hey
From the outside lookin' in, it seems that I'm fine
But they don't know shit about the everyday grind
Time is money, money is time
They tell me get there at five but I'm runnin' behind
I try and live a little, go and have a little fun
You only young once, all the hatin', that be dumb
If life a joke, then I'm waitin' for the pun
You all about the beef but me, I'm 'bout the bun, the bread
'Cause I was just a little knucklehead
Now I got my shit together, spittin' what they fuckin' with
If they ain't, it's great, no attention to the hate
Nothin' changed, still cuttin' up, Henny's still my drink
I'm still the same old dude, now I'm makin' moves
It's like everything I do front-page news
I ain't playin' in this game to lose
I want it all, no secret, the change, they can keep it
You might also like
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy (Nothin' easy)
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe me

Hey
My grandpa told me one day I'll be everything and more
It's better never to question every lesson that's in store
See, it's a blessin' that I'm gettin' through the door
The money gon' fall, when it rain, it pour
Dear music, you're everything I have now
When there's an army comin' for me, I won't back down
'Cause I never was a kid in the background
Just a class clown, but who's laughin' now?
My moms cried when she saw me in a cap and gown
It feel great to see my family proud, but
I make mistakes too
My people always tell me, "Mac, please don't ever let the fame change you"
They say I'm so different, but it ain't true
Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew
I'm just doin' what it takes for me to make do
And everyone around me gettin' paid too
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy (Nothin' easy)
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe me1Embed
