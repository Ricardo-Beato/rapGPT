5 ContributorsUber Driver Flow Lyrics
Tryna keep my pockets swole, I don't answer to nobody
If it ain’t about the money then it ain't about nuttin

Somebody call a Uber and get this bitch away from me
Dirty ratchet bitch wanna fight but I'm too Maybelline
Get this bitch a hug or some drugs or some tissue please
I don’t know what her issue is, I don't know where her nigga been
I ain't no jaw-jackin' bitch but my outfit be talking shit (Bitch)
Running through the mall with your daddy, he bought all this shit
I gotta keep breaking hoes out (Break em out)
'Cause my name stay in these hoes mouth (Yeah)
I can bet on they ass like the south
Living like a vacay, taking off
Ay, lighting up my phone, he like "Megan, what you on?"
I'm like "Chillin, getting money, sipping Henny in this thong"
He say "Girl, I'm finna come see"
I said "Nah, nigga, stay where you be"
I don't need your bitch trippin’ on me
Mr. Krab ass hoes, salty (Ahh)

I’m tryna find a way that I can spend all of this paper (Make this paper nigga)
I'm riding round, I’m chiefing loud
I'm tryna keep my pockets on swole (Tryna keep my pockets swole)
I do just what I want, don't see myself answering to no one (I don't answer to nobody)
Ain’t bout the money, then I'm not involved (If it ain't about the money then it ain't about nuttin)

What the fuck I did? What the fuck I do?
Sad ass hoe, still mad, what's new?
Came in this bitch with the too live crew
And a two-piece looking like new-new
Everythang on fleek, yo' old bitch so weak
Yo' best friend my freak and yo nigga take me to eat
Pop that, pop that, pop that, pop that, pop that shit, don't stop
Ah, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, booty on jiggle when I walk
Ay, she damn near wrecked my car
Tryna drive all on this bar (Damn)
Bitch I am a star, I live next door to Mars (Ay)
I ain't with the drama, I ain't with the drama (I ain't really with it nigga)
Don't be blowing up my phone, call your baby mama (Call your baby mama nigga)
If you hit me more than twice it must be 'bout some money (Motherfuckin' money)
Ay, I'm just being real, I ain't actin' funny (Ay)

I'm tryna find a way that I can spend all of this paper (Make this paper nigga)
I'm riding round, I'm chiefing loud
I'm tryna keep my pockets on swole (Tryna keep my pockets swole)
I do just what I want, don't see myself answering to no one (I don't answer to nobody)
Ain't bout the money, then I'm not involved (If it ain't about the money then it ain't about nuttin)Embed
