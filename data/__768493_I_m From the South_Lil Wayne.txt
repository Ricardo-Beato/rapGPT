6 ContributorsI’m From the South Lyrics
Yeah
Nigga you ain’t from -
I’m from -

Uh
I'm Weezy F, bitch, what it do? (What it do?)
I got that "fuck a mothafucka" attitude (Fuck you)
I got a gun and a bitch I got two, (I got two)
I got a bitch and a gun I got two (I got two)
I'm the hottest in this bitch, straight up (Straight up)
I got 'em on my back like, "Wait up" (Wait up)
I ain't finished with you hoes, stay up (Stay up)
I'm at the top, bitch, look way up (Way up)
Niggas trippin', bitches wishin' they'll come down here and fuck me
Sick and tired of that city and she fiendin' for country
I ain't mad at ya girl, she just feelin my gangsta
From the bottom of the map where the bricks get anchored
Where the dope is heavy, where the hoes is fine
Where the hoes'll get you if you niggas is blind
So, this is the time you should listen to mine
Don't play wit' it, bitch nigga, this is the side!

Bitch, I'm from the side, the Southside
We all ride
And when we catch a outsider outside: y'all die
We all ride
And when you see us, we be leaning to the side, the Southside
We all ride
And when we catch a outsider outside: y'all die
We all ride
Ay, pussy nigga, you know you ain't from the side
You might also like
Bitch, chaperone, fresh, Dapper Don
TEC, the strap is on, brrat, your back is off
Yep, bag 'em up, yep, bag 'em down
Yep, crack 'em up, the new crack in town
It's Weezy, say the baby, lotta pizzazz about me
Hollygrove, seventeen, Belfast, Eagle Street
Shells pass illegal heat, 12s blast leave 'em sleep, trash can, no sheets
Swell, man
Hell has no fury but I'm strapped so don't worry
When the weather starts to flurry, we adapt in a hurry
Less guts and glory, man, upchuck the party, man
Buck, buck your Carter, man
Fuck, fuck, duck, duck, they caught him
Get away smooth from the pig
Ditch the cig in a river wit' his wig, his liver, and his feet
Down south, Louisiana, 504, we don't lose

Bitch, I'm from the side, the Southside
We all ride
And when we catch a outsider outside: y'all die
We all ride
And when you see us, we be leaning to the side, the Southside
We all ride
And when we catch a outsider outside: y'all die
We all ride (Yeah)
Ay, pussy nigga (Block burner), you know you ain't from the side! (bang!)
I spin a bin wit' my thirty-six straight saggin'
No smiles, on some murder shit straight clappin'
Waste bag ya niggas
And what makes matters worse, they rattin' niggas
I put ya mothafuckin' face in the dirt, kiss the snails, boy
Close the box, drill the nails, boy
You won't bite, you are a just a will
You are just a witness when the shit prevail
You are not real, you're more bitch than your girl
Get her down south and put some dick in her world
I got diamonds in my mouth, I got diamonds on my neck
Got a bad second woman and I'm 'bout to wife that
Visitors and tourists come down and we gon' lose ya
Have a mothafucka thinkin' that they in Aruba
Max and Rugers, shootin' to kill you
Your music don't reach down here, we don't feel you

Bitch, I'm from the side, the Southside
We all ride
And when we catch a outsider outside: y'all die
We all ride
And when you see us, we be leaning to the side, the Southside
We all ride
And when we catch a outsider outside: y'all die
We all ride
Ay, pussy nigga, you know you ain't from the side!Embed
