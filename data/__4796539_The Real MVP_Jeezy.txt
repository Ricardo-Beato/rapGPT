8 ContributorsThe Real MVP Lyrics
Yeah, what's up?
All my real niggas with me, sing
20/20 hindsight, you gotta just do today, you know?
Caught up in the grind
Do you hear me? That's great

Oh, sometimes I don't know where I'm turning to
Sometimes I don't know, you know?
I look in the mirror
Look in that mirror
And I see the truth
All my real niggas with me, sing
But the truth is, I don't know what to do now
All my real niggas with me, sing
I'm so lost without you

Truth is, yeah, I wish I was better (Swear to God)
I was chasing the cheddar (Yeah)
I ain't take the time to write you a letter
I was too busy chasing the funds
I ain't take the time out to take a day and just be your son
Middle school, yeah, I got me a pack
Yeah, I got me a sack
Daddy gone, so I pick up the slack
Lord knows that you need a new couch
And if I had it my way right now, I'd buy you a house
If you gon' stay here, be watching your mouth
Then what I do?
Turn around and hid them eight balls all in your house (Damn)
Safe to say I was breaking the rules
I was posted on Poplar Street, pocket full of rocks and a tool
No secret, I was failing the school
Had you crying so much late night that you could fill up a pool
What's Heaven when you're living in Hell?
DA hoping I fail, so they can lock me up and give me a cell (Hey)
You might also like
Sometimes I don't know where I'm turning to
All my real niggas with me, sing
I look in the mirror
All my real niggas with me, sing
I see the truth
All my real niggas with me, sing
But the truth is, I don't know what to do now
All my real niggas with me, sing
I'm so lost without you

With my hopes and my dreams on the scale
All I know is all these hard times keep making you frail (Ayy)
And maybe I'm just chasing a dream or maybe caught in the hype
We got faith, then we gon' be alright
That mean we gon' make it tonight, we gon' live tomorrow
Grind it up, no beggin' or borrowin' (Nah)
And lately you been all on my mind, spending all of my time
Tryin' not to go out of my mind (Yeah)
And lately I been having my strap
'Cause I don't know which one of these so-called niggas got my back
Just know that you raised you a king, I might live all my dreams (Believe that)
Despite the fact that it's hard as it seems, yeah
I know you see me rockin' the crowds, hope I'm makin' you proud
God plans, he heard you pray for your child (Yeah)
And even though I'm feeding my team and I'm doin' my thing
Gotta say, all hail to the queen, hey
I don't know where I'm turning to
All my real niggas with me, sing
I look in the mirror
All my real niggas with me, sing
I see the truth
All my real niggas with me, sing
But the truth is, I don't know what to do now
All my real niggas with me, sing
I'm so lost without you

And last, my mom
I don't think you know what you did
You had my brother when you were 18 years old
Three years later, I came out
The odds were stacked against us
One of the best memories I had was when we moved into our, our first apartment
No bed, no furniture, and we just all sat in the living room and just hugged each other
'Cause we, that's what we, we thought we made it
When something good happens to you, I don't know about you guys, but I tend to look back to what brought me here
You made us believe, you kept us off the street
Put clothes on our backs, food on the table
You went to sleep hungry, you sacrificed for us
You the real MVP
I look in the mirror, I see the truth
But the truth is, I don't know what to do now
I'm so lost without you1Embed
