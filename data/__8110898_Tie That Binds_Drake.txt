Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Kill me slowly with those piercin' eyes
Don't break my fall
Hidin' from those stars, foreign inside
Every time
I know you're here
I never felt so alive (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Slowly you're pullin' me 'cross the line
In no time, in no time

Ayy
Oh, baby, I'm feelin' all sort of things
I never wanna see you ever leave
Maybe I'll take you to my family
Change your name
Oh, baby


With no doubt I'll give you all my time
And walk the line
You bring out the best part of me, babe
Effortlessly, effortlessly
Hope you never dim the light (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hold me close as you can 'til we're ghost
It's a promise, 'til we're ghost
You might also like
Ayy
Oh, baby, I'm feelin' all sort of things
I never wanna see you ever leave
Maybe I'll take you to my family
Change your name
Oh, baby

Please, don't leave me
You know I need you, you know I need you, yeah
Please, don't leave me
You know I need you, you know I need you, yeah
Please, don't leave me
You know I need you, you know I need you, yeah
Please, don't leave me
You know I need you, you know I need you, yeah
Please, don't leave me
You know I need you, you know I need you, yeah
Please, don't leave me
You know I need you, you know I need you, yeah
Please, don't leave me
You know I need you, you know I need you, yeah
Please, don't leave me
You know I need you, you know I need you, yeah
