18 ContributorsVacation from Myself Lyrics
I don't need me sophistication
What I need me is a vacation
I said I don't need no sophistication
What I need me is a vacation from myself
Is a vacation from my life
No sophistication
Oh, no, no, no, no saturation
Keep the peace, no, I don't need no confrontation
I got tequila in my hand, this is a celebration
Dying on the cross for your salvation
Feeling like a star constellation
I said I don't need no sophistication
What I need me is a vacation from myself
Is a vacation from my life
No sophisticationYou might also like4Embed
