12 ContributorsSwing Set Lyrics
I wanna be on you
Wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Yeah (Ayo, Jerm)
(Ayy, put  in my headphones) It's your boy, Mac Miller
(We about to go in) Triple E's
Ayo, Jenesis Magazine, Fab Five, I see y'all, man
Most Dope, motherfuckers
Let's get it

Cruisin' through the city with the windows down
Blowin' through a pound, ready for another round
Some hoes in the back of the whip and they rollin' (Rollin')
Servin' pussy like the U.S. Open
Blowin' on this potent, different flavors, I done saw them all (Saw them all)
I be stayin' higher than the Taj Mahal, straight epic
So now you can't forget it
Kickin' girls out the crib like they got some bad credit (Peace)
When you blowed and you drunk (Drunk) and you ain't give a fuck
Take this soul and this funk, tell the DJ, "Turn it up" (Turn it up)
Purple stuff, got it stirrin' in my cup
With hoes, I get around like the wheels on the bus
I'm a true player, original Mac
And I keep the pussy poppin', here, listen to that
Hoes showin' me some love, so I'm givin' it back (Back, back)
She wanna be Mrs. Mac, how you figure that?

Swang, and swang, and swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
(Go 'head and ride me like a swing set)
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
(Go on and ride me like a swing set)
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
(Up and down)
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
(Up and down, ride me like a swing set)

Ride (Ride), swerve (Swerve)
That's how you do it in the 'Burgh ('Burgh)
When you high off the herb and you fly as a bird
With some horny hoes waitin' in the burbs (Haha)
You gotta go (Go), lookin' fresh like the cap on
And your girlie still wet from the last song
Ladies like, "Mac Miller? Ooh, I wanna marry him" (Haha)
If it's sex and drugs, then I'm heroin
I pick her up just to ride around
Twistin' somethin' purple, have us flyin' to a higher ground
(Higher ground) She love ridin' with the kid right here (Uh-huh)
She's still gon' be in love this time next year (Uh-huh)
'Cause I'm a heartbreaker, mover and shaker
She love watchin' what I do with my paper
Lovin' how I play her, loud like a banger
Lil' Mama lip gloss, mouthful of flavor
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
(Go 'head and ride me like a swing set)
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
(Go on and ride me like a swing set)
Swang, swang, and swang, and swang to the left
(Up and down)
Pop-Pop my trunk and dip, dip, dip
(Up and down, ride me like a swing set)

Go 'head and ride me like a swing set
Go on and ride me like a swing set1Embed
