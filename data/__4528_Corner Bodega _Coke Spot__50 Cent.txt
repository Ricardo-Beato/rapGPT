18 ContributorsCorner Bodega (Coke Spot) Lyrics

Aight, check this shit out
Y'all niggas gon' stay in the car, I'ma go and handle this shit
(Aight, aight)
Gimme ten minutes, If I don't come out, y'all come in
The money stays in the car 'til I say so...
(No doubt)
Ayo, what up, what up
(Ayo, what up, what up, man)
Well, this is what y'all niggas is workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram?
(Yeah, man, what you want for that thing?)

Man, when I come up in here, treat me like I'm fam
I can go Uptown and get this shit 16 cents a gram
Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
Got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Papi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit, I'm on some "get this money" shit
Every four days in PA, I move another brick
According to the DEA, I sold dope in VA
My coupe stay in Queens, but the plates read VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it ain't hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on consignment
(Hey, times is hard, mayne) I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case, I'ma kill Guiliani
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
Got task ridin 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes

NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money, man, get that money, man
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money, man, get that money, man

Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around (uh-huh)
That means I copped and I went outta town (that's right)
You motherfuckers know how I get down
I'm bout my money, man, I'm bout my money, man
Yeah!4Embed
