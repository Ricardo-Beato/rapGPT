16 ContributorsThe R Lyrics
Whoever underestimated still waited
Pumpin' the radio, finally, they played it
You wondered how come the album was late?
I was givin' you time to get the last one straight
The show must go on, I got somethin' to dance to
Slow it down and romance to and give me a chance to
Keep you in tune and up to par
Then you're doin' it with The R
Doin' it with The R

Somethin' new and to keep you doin' what you're doin'
This is for you and your crew and for who in
The vicinity, I don't need no identity
I see hands in the air, that means many be
Cooperatin', I can't stop relatin'
Hip-hop is makin' more sense when I'm statin'
Paragraphs of potential to prevent you from usin' my instrumental
Keep in mind, I meant to
Illustrate another iller break immediately
Hurry up and learn the words and repeat it with me
Then soon, you're in tune and up to par
And then you're doin' it with The R
Keep doin' it, you keep doin' it with The R
You might also like
In the summertime, pockets bulgin'
Something's happenin', then I'm indulgin'
Music is mine, Gucci seats reclined
Gold grill, a paint job will shine
Pull up in the park and then pop the trunk
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
A block party starts to form, people start to swarm
Loud as a ghetto blaster, word is bond
Records remind you of a madness
The moment it's played, you get glad it's
The return of the brother, keepin' you up to par
And you're doing it with The R

You know what I'm sayin'?
The microphone fiend Rakim in full effect
DJ Eric B. need more records to wreck
To the Queens posse, you're doin' it with the R
Brooklyn, you're doin' it with The R
The Bronx is doin' it with The R
Manhattan, keep doin' it with The R
And Strong Island, you're doin it with The R
Wyandanch and the Paid In Full posse doin' it with The R
Peace to the Nation of Islam
And I'm outta here
