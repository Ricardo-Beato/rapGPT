5 ContributorsStop Playin Witâ€™ Me Lyrics
Stop playin with me (Playing with me)
Ya'll betta
Actin' like they fuckin' with young whatever
Know they ain't fuckin' with young, ya know better
Then you know the real is back. Who Better?

Get 'em young
Thank the lord man they finaly freed my nigga Slick
Next week they turned around and killed my nigga Tick
And we gone miss ya cuz, and you can trust that
So fucked up about it I couldn't call Buck back
On my 100 blunt feeling like a lunatic
Please lord tell me why they killed my nigga Tick
Cash filled stand up never lay down
Put it to the back of his dome and tell em lay down
Yeah nigga, stay down, we used to stay down
Made my first 1500 right on the playground
Got a fresh one and a half right by the swings
First nigga try to creep, my shit pull out them things


Hol' up I ain't liking how this goin'
Just a few summers ago I had it snowing
If that motherfucka snow man piece I had it glowin
Pink perrya rosay I had it bowin
Word on the street If them birds you had em sowin
Used to hate countin the 10s and 5s thought it was borin'
Now how that nigga fold all that he want it towin
Who knew I'd get them federal chips if I was tourin'?
I pulled up at the ghetto and shit, in somethin foreign
Cause I'm straight up out that federal shit, got nuthin' for em
Know why he say he act all funny you hella sound right
Same nigga told you that shit the hell do you know
