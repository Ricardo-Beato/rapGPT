Hey
Ma-ma-ma, ma-moon
Hey
Ma-ma-ma, ma-moon

When the days change
So does my attitude
I'm messy at home
I eat a lot of junk food
When the nights change
So do my nightmares too
I dream reality
Is my dream

All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
Out there on my own
Yeah
You might also like
When the weeks change
The rumors change too
I'm addicted to highs
Would you like to know why?
When the months change
So do my love point of views
I don't want what I need
What I need hates me
What I need hates me

I know all along
All along
I know I'm meant to be alone
It's crazy
But all along
All along
I knew I was meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah

Suppose somehow the lionhearted
Failed to win
Who will be the villain?
All the strangers voted for him
Suppose somehow the lionhearted
Failed to smile
Who will be the villain?
All the strangers voted for him
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah45Embed
