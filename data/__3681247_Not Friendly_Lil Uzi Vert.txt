Smokin' on this gas, little bitch can't smell it, yeah
Ten steps ahead so I cannot fell down
Yeah, huh, diamonds water like a well, yeah
Speakin' of this water, yeah, my pockets swelled up
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ayy)
What is the problem?
My homie pull up right there with the llama
Spanish bitch on me, como se llama?
I like my jewelry when it be shinin'
All my rings on my finger like Sonic
All my rings on my finger like Sonic
Turn the record just up, let me sign it, ayy
Duck down when I find it
Know I gotta keep my pole, yeah, my Glock-You might also like1Embed
