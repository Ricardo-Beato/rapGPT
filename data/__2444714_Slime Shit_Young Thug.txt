Slatt!
Ayy, get out your motherfuckin' seat to this one, you know?
Slatt! Slatt! Slatt!

Hundred rounds in a Tahoe
Nigga, lighting up your tacos, hey
Give him surgery, no lipo
They don't blame that bitch for pulling ya down
Pull up to a nigga town
I'm prepared to take 'em down, nigga

Hey, this that slime shit, hey
YSL shit, hey
Killin' 12 shit, hey
Fuck a jail shit, hey
Drinking Actavis, hey
On that snail shit, hey
Cookin' white brick, hey, hey
Bricks and Bales shit, hey, hey
Bitch, I'm super rich
Bitch, I'm stupid rich

I'm not new to this, hey, I'm so true to this, hey
I done put a whole slime on a hunnid licks, hey, hey

Slime or get slimed, maniac don't have a mind
These niggas be bitches, a lot of them snitchin'
A lot of them droppin' a dime
I come to the the point in my life
That I just want one of my wives
I think that I want that new Spider
We rich so I know they dislike us
I'm so too legit, on some Hammer shit
Diamonds dancin', bitch
YSL, VVS
In the VIP and I got that pistol on my hip
You prayin' that you live
I'm prayin' that I hit
Hey, this that slime shit
Need a slime bitch
Compromise shit, down to ride shit
Fuck, fuck the police (Fuck 'em), in a high speed
Let her out on Bleveland
Let her out on Bleveland

Hundred rounds in a Tahoe
Nigga, lighting up your tacos, hey
Give him surgery, no lipo
Down, man, that bitch will pull you down
Pull up to a nigga town
I'm prepared to take 'em down, nigga
Hey, this that slime shit, hey

Got banana clips for all these niggas actin' monkey
These niggas amateurs in these streets
They need hooked on phonics
Got ten trap spots, they bunkin', all of 'em doin' numbers
They just be talking, I swear these lil' fuck niggas don't want it
I ranned up my money and I'm still in the trenches
Workin' calculators, when we fuck with weight, we call 'em benches
Got Bergalo and Troupe, they with me (They real neighborhoods)
Bang a neighborhood, 60's, Tiny Locs, they official
I get, I get it, I get it, however, I get it, I get it on my own
These percocets, they got me so high, I swear to God I'm in my own damn zone (I'm high)
Thousand dollars on cologne
All these extras, I bought me a home
And it's big like a dome
Hold, up country boy callin' my phone (Brr, man I just saw them)
Hundred rounds in a Tahoe
Nigga, lighting up your tacos, hey
Give him surgery, no lipo
Down, man, that bitch will pull you down
Pull up to a nigga town
I'm prepared to take 'em down, nigga

Hey, this that slime shit, hey

This that slime shit
This that mob shit
This that 100,000 dollars do the job shit
Down to die about this rap shit 'cause itâ€™s too much money
They say we gettin' money
Now these niggas actin' funny
And they all fake like some bitch titties
Tell they bitch another lie 'cause we ain't fuckin' wit' 'em
And they groupie niggas and they ho type
Fuck the judge, YSL, this that mob life

We got these bankrolls on us
We in Vegas
Now I ain't goin' back and forth with y'all
Hello? Yeah, I'ma bet me a 100,000
All motherfuckin hundreds
Shit, yeah, put me up20Embed
