The morning after

What time is it? 7:48
Where, where are my—, where are my—
Where are my panties?
Oh my God, where are my panties?
Damn, where—, I don't–
He gon' think I'm a ho
Fuck that, I liked it
I was drunk and it was my birthday anyway
Maybe I should just lay here and let him touch my booty
Mmm, but he don't even know my name

I know she think I just think she some kind of ho
I don't give a shit about givin' it up on the first night
That's just lettin' me know
She know what she want outta life
What a hell of a way to goddamn wake up
Ooh, that shit was good
Oh, maybe she'd get me some breakfast?
And, she so goddamn sweet, sweet as she wanna be
Ooh, I just lay—, ooh, I wanna lay in her hair
You can't fall for it, don't fall for it, Ice Cold (Ice Cold)
Maybe I just roll over and just lay on her booty, yeah
Naw, no, no
Nah, just lay here and be cool, be cool, Ice Cold (Ice Cold)
But what if she's the—
What if she—, what if she—, what if she's the one?You might also like2Embed
