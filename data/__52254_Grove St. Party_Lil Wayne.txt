91 ContributorsGrove St. Party Lyrics
Woo!
Hahahaha

I got a whole lotta money, pop that pussy for me
My homie got that yopper, he a-bang it at a copper
Ayy, gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Stove on my waist, cook your ass up, gourmet
All-black four-four, do you want foreplay?
I'm going at your face like Oil of Olay
No champagne, but you know my flag rosé
Swagger on steroids: Canseco, Jose
No Limit Records: We so 'bout it 'bout it
I'm higher than a bitch, feel like I climbed a fucking mountain
Illest nigga you know, my accountant still counting
Shot hit him a minute ago, but his body still bouncing
Beam on the hammer, beam on your forehead
Gotta kill the witnesses 'cause Birdman car red
Hollygrove Monster, Eagle Street creature
Come to your funeral, kill everybody but the preacher
I live in Miami, nigga, I'll South Beach you
Robin Leach—uh, that's how we ballin'
You know that I'm loaded, but please don't think it's sweeter
Beat one of you bitch niggas up like John Cena
Them hoes on Young Money, tell them hoes we coming
Boy, we get it popping, we ain't saving hoes, we swapping
Yeah, gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Big-head Desert Eagle, call it Sade
I just get that money, Stunna taught me that
That Xan took me under, Patrón brought me back
I'm leaning on these motherfuckers like I caught a flat
And that Glock snap back like an old Starter hat, haha!
What the lick read? I'm in the big league
I'm a breath of fresh air—let the bitch breathe
I'm tryna chillax, but I had to do it, Dev
I'm at the funeral, like, "I had to do it, Rev.!"
Mack, you my big brother, I'll split a wig for you
Put that on Mary P., until they bury me
Moment of clarity—yeah, that's my diamond game
I keep a fine bitch 'cause I like the finer things
Haha! Fuck with me, slime
No brain on the whip, I got nothing in mind, hehe
Carter 4, they ain't fucking with mine
I drop that Sorry 4 the Wait to make up for the time, yeah!
