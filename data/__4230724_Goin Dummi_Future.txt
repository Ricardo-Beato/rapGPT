It's okay, 'kay (Wheezy, Pluto)
Yeah, baby ain't play, play
Last name Hndrxx whatever I do
(Wheezy outta here)

Woo, everything we do, we goin' dummy (Woo)
Whatever I do, I hope I got that Tommy (Hrrr)
Just in case a nigga try to play, play, play (Just in case)
Yeah, every watch I own on tsunami (Brrr)
Chain on frost, ask Sonny (Go ask)
Tryna pose a threat, go at your mommy
It's okay, 'kay (Okay)

Intercontineezy, got a spaceship parked
Fine Europeans look good in the dark (Fine)
Meet me in the jacuzzi, girl, we made it (We made it)
Christian Dior already slated
Yeah, you try to leave me, downgradin' (Downgrade)
I can't save you from the apes out the cages (Out the cages)
Phone book in my jeans like pages (Freebandz)
This money I crave, it is so contagious
Sometimes get caught up in that mission, don't get caught inside the loop
V.I.P. with raw fishes, I'ma show ya what it do
We get splashy, we get Percs for no reason
Got some tall, wet blondie at Four Seasons (Yee)
You might also like
Woo, everything we do, we goin' dummy (Yee)
Whatever I do, I hope I got that Tommy (Woo)
Just in case a nigga try to play, play, play
Yeah, every watch I own on tsunami (Every watch I own)
Chain on frost, ask Sonny (Go and ask)
Tryna pose a threat, go at your mommy
It's okay, 'kay (Okay)

Tell me what the lick read, we gon' go and get it (What's the lick?)
Real fine mixed breed, I can't wait to hit it
I'ma put your bank account past seven digits (A mil'-dgy)
Bottles on the rocks, girl, everything exquisite (Exquis-y)
You deserve to cha-cha, but girl, I want my chain-chain (Cha-cha)
We got all the choppas and we got all the bling-bling
Give a nigga that na-na, you get wet up, your dream-dream
Ain't gon' beg for it, my Bentley came with wing-wing
Fuck with a supreme team, you will never fall off
Every day a spring bling, make you wanna call off
Got some models comin' to the top floor at the Waldorf (Top)
Feel like new Sopranos 'cause we way above the law now

Woo, everything we do, we goin' dummy
Whatever I do, I hope I got that Tommy (Whatever I do)
Just in case a nigga try to play, play, play
Yeah (Yeah), every watch I own on tsunami (Every watch I own)
Chain on frost, ask Sonny (Brr, brr)
Tryna pose a threat, go at your mommy
It's okay, 'kay (Okay)4Embed
