My bitch, she came from Dubai, she got that good brain like Devry
I'm smoking and leaning and driving, I hope I don't get DUI
Watch out for the snake and the lies

I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically

Finessing the plug with accuracy, now he after me
Got 100 Ps in the Sprinter, nigga no athlete
And I got that chicken, no Mrs. Winners
Meet the plug at the KFC and I finesse his ass after dinner
Call me Quavo the Godzilla
Red Bentley, Forgiatos on it, call it thriller
Diamonds thrill her in Manila
Fuck her from the back, I’m facing a pillar
You pull up with choppers but are you a killer?
Mirror mirror, got a riddle for you fuck niggas
What if you get in a pickle?
If you catch a body would you tell on your peer?
If you hold it down, keep it 100, you real
Samurai sword cut the brick, Kill Bill
I trap out the mansion on Beverly Hill
RIP to Uncle Phil, fresh prince, call me Quavo Will
I know that this money a blessing
I’m thanking the lord when I kneel
We the only niggas in the city having seals
Naw, for real!

Feeling like Marshawn Lynch in the interview, I’m thankful
Walk in the room with these trophies on my neck like you in a banquet
You acting like you really tough but you soft in the heart, you a diamond
Young nigga hopped off the porch, I was anxious
Just a young nigga old niggas embraced
Juug and finesse a nigga on my faith
Keep a little grip on my pistol, say my grace
We in the jungle, my niggas go ape
Whipping the dummy, this what I create
I fuck your bitch while you take her on dates
Nobody know I smash her on my lake
Talking fast to the plug, juuged him for 8
Stacking bricks, LA Clippers, call me Blake
Thanking the lord for my situation
Used to have bricks on the intersection
Sipping Act, daily medication
Who really real in investigations
You gonna tell because what you facing
He got out of jail and they couldn’t trace it
It’s a mystery, can’t even solve the case
Don’t be that nigga put on a plate

Finesse him with accuracy
Running with the work, police tryna tackle me
Short days, long nights, trapping at the Quality Control factory
Abracadabra, work disappear magically
I’m in the kitchen whipping, it’s a tragedy
Whipping the masterpiece, then I go smoke on my balcony
My niggas and family count on me
Trapping that snow white in that van, they calling me ice cream man
I see trash bags but no trash, nigga I’m the trash bag man
I see red and white blue lights, undercover lurking in the Sedan
Start with a cutie, break it down
Bag it up, wrap it up, that was the plan
Now I’m pitching soft and curveballs
Or I can pitch it to you underhand
Remember trapping out of Camrys
Until we won Grammys
Now you niggas cannot step on my property or my grass, feel like I’m Stanley
I took his bitch, he mad at me
Fuck em fuck em, pull up on him in the alley
I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened

So what part of Atlanta y'all from?
From the north side
Uh, yeah
Every show get crazy and crazy
We growing and growing every, every, every time at a show

Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

Quavo
We killed the Versace, we went to Bahamas, shout out to the islands
Mommas and daughters they taking a picture with me and they smiling
Charlemagne said the gang Donkey of the Day (Charlamagne?)
Billboard magazine, 45K
Word on the street they say the Migos wanted
But they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders
When you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it
Check my schedule, itinerary loaded of course
Check my dab, it's priceless
And my niggas is righteous
I don't got no type, but I love to fuck Pisces
The chains on my neck, I might get arthritis
YRN Tha Album first album going diamond
Got my mama a Benz
Just to show her I'm grinding
Green dots in the pen but I hate the confinement
When Offset got out of jail he ate a bowl of hundreds
Dropped the Rich Nigga Timeline and we was crossed the country

Graat, he shook up

My niggas got grenades and bazookas
On the private jet we smoking up in indica
A hundred thousand, got a pick up in India
Headed to locker, we changed the millennium
Thirty thousand for a walk through minimum
Snakes in the grass start spitting out venom
That come with the territory when a nigga winning
Tinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image
The blogs say I need to calm down, fuck a image
Your CEO a busta and my CEO a hustler
Choppa sound like percussion, run up on me repercussion
Came from nothing, came home with a half a million, hurt my stomach
I'm taking good care of my kids but they mamma get nothing
And if you think its wrong this ain't the right song you're bumping
Welcome to the jungle, lions, elephants and monkeys
Never see me lonely, best believe nina on me
Stuffed crust, my pocket walking with a 50 on me

You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up

Pyrex pot on the stove, take that eggbeater cook up
They looking for the origin, wanna know how did we make this shit up
Came in there right and we fucking it up
Jump off the banana boat, call me King Tut
Niggas be biting our swag I tried to switch it up
But these niggas still don't get enough
Niggas with attitude don't give a fuck
Young nigga flexing never did a push up
Migo flow everybody wanna look it up
Every ten years it's on my story bro
I bet you listen up, you don't gotta like it
Yo favorite rapper he be biting
When I step in the booth, its a moment of silence
I bet yo bitch she get excited
When I'm doing show my front end and that back end be enormous
I need a double cup with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing
Can't get in my tour bus bitch, ain't tryna fuck, it's only 5 in the morning
I got some Dominican bitches that sucking and fucking and back to the origin
Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up

We was some crazy young niggas huh?

I'd like to welcome you to Yung Rich Nation
I know you been patiently waiting
Yung Rich Nation that's the album
Tryna turn the mansion to a castle

Diamond shine came from Africa, shine, shine (Africa)
(Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors) Ooh, damn, bachelor
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
(If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ya, pitiful) Sad to say

First check bought a Audi Coupe
It was black and grey like the Raiders
First check bought a Challenger
It was 10 bands so I paid it
Remember the time, Offset he got me high
That was right by the neighbors house?
Remember the time we broke in the neighbors house
That was our first paper route
Remember the time they shot up my mama house
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time you niggas laughed at me
Said that I wouldn't bond out
You say that you trappin', take you to the bando
Hand you a fork, see what you bout
Before we made the song Hit Em' wit it
We was knockin' niggas out
Before we made the song 'Birds', pelicans fly to the south
Niggas talkin' stupid up in crowd
Jumped in the crowd and punched em' in the mouth
First time we in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock, and we beat the trap out
Don't come in my trap if you unannounced (Pussy)

Got home and counted the check
I'm thinkin' to myself Takeoff what you gon' do wit that
Call the plug up ask him where he at

Remember that time Quavo came home with a full grown marijuana plant
Stinkin' up the crib tryin' dry it off in the oven it was still wet
Mama came in smelt the odor said "Damn boy I can catch contact"
I got that dope talkin' anthrax, hit a fat one when we hit for fifty racks

Runnin' from 12 in a Gucci fleece
It's a great feeling that they notice me
Came from bando to mansion to TV screen

Tell my brother that I'm slipping and I'm in trouble
So the nigga I don't like made a move to the right
I grabbed the Glock and point it at him on sight
The nigga to the left told me put the gun down
BOW one round, Uh, its going down
I ran out the store, I can't believe I ain't hit
My migos pull up with macs and sticks
Rel hopped out and let 2 shots off
Then I looked around the corner it's Gwinnett County law
I rolled down the window, it's the officer
Put his nose in my car, and say he smell the herb
He opened up the door and asked me can he search?
Hell Naw, officer you know how much I'm worth?

Came up from the bottom, now a nigga having power
Used to trap and slang powder, new Rolly ice on my hours

Feeling like Donald Trump, bitch you is fired
All my niggas blowing up like a fuckin' tire
Late nights in the bando feel like The Wire
My niggas heard that you snitchin, where is your wire?
And it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer
Said it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer!

Now my palms itching
Came from bomb pitching
My mama be the witness
Free my convicts
That took a long sentence
All my niggas came from the north, they born menace
Ay, ay, no Kanye
I walk in the trap, play with yay
Bao, bao, bao, ra-ra-rao watch what you mu’fuckers say (shhh)
Call up the lean, pour an eight
Then pop an eight, tray tray
Then I fill a Backwood, the cookies it came from the Bay
Bitch, I came from the trap
Take her phone, she wanna snap
I don’t get no sleep, I just take naps
I look out the peep, 12 at the trap
I look out my peep, 12 at the trap
Ay, my nigga gon’ run with that sack
Ay, my nigga gon’ flush that lil pack
I jump out the window then forty yard dash
That’s the shit I used to do in the past
Now we through playing, we playing with cash
Droppin my top just to dump out the ash
Wrestle with work like my name Kevin Nash
Let me take it back just for two minutes
Fourteens and the nines, had tools in it
And you notice that it didn’t have windows
That the first fucking million dollar bando

You think my life was a riddle
Till I send my niggas go and get them

We used to kick doors and all
Now we fuck hoes and ball

My car is robotic, my wrist is robotic
Hit the Glock and I cock it, you take a nap

But I swapped out my hoe for that
Young nigga talking business
Tell that nigga I ain’t here for that
Migo Gang like the Thundercats
And I’m trapping out a Hellcat
Pussy nigga, you a lab rat
Bitch, my diamonds doing jumping jacks
Pull up, gave a Phantom heart attack
Hoe nigga, where your heart is at?
We quick to send ‘em to the cardiac
Cookies and Perc’ – that’s the starter pack
Go to the jeweler; want all of that
Ball on my court, nigga, can’t get the ball back
I be where the money fall at
I take the pot and beat it with a ball bat
You ain’t own it boy, you rented that
If it ain’t broke I ain’t fixing that
I put the dope in the trunk
I put the extras in the kitty-cat

My jeweler made me look like Slick the Ruler
My bitches bougie, walking with a poodle
When I was little, thought bitches had cooties
Now that I’m grown, got a brick in her coochie
Finesse the plug; I hit him with the whoop-de-whoo
Finessed him right out his shoe
I got some boot in my Margiela boots
Bitches running ‘round my mansion in nude
Bitches stick to me like Gorilla Glue
Smoking on cookies did somebody poo?
You niggas is suckers; you a roody-poo
YRN 2, ball alert, got the news
Sipping on Actavis, like it’s a brew

Yes we can fuck, is your friend fucking too?
(Ooh, Boaw!) I’m killing her too
Plan B, you can fuck her for free

They say they ridin' around the city broke
That's 'cause they tryna keep up with the 'cho (Keep up!)
Eyes closed, whippin' it blindfold
She get on that pole, get bi-polar
Six cell phones and I ain't social
Still goin' big, cup like Magnolia

If you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper
How you gon' big on big?
If you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres
How you gon' big on big?
If I got the Draco and you got the Sig

Where were you... when times was hard?
It's pitiful, how you gon' big when we extra large?
Four car garage... two bad broads
I don't flex or floss... I'm a rockstar
With no guitar, Lambo avatar (Lambo)
Sippin' on some tar (Act) I'm livin' above the bar
Wrist on froze, wrist on froze (Ice)
Your lil' hoe... been my hoe (Smash smash)
Green Lambo... Piccolo (Skrr skrr)
Diamonds drippin' on me, Nickelodeon (Splash)
You goin' too big, you talkin' 'bout money, you bother me
(You makin' me sick)
I own all of my cars, jewelry, and I got property

Building these houses in places, I'm playing Monopoly
Please do not talk to me
You don't do nothin', you obsolete

When a nigga talk crazy, hang his ass
Like Suge did Vanilla Ice
Wish a nigga would try to steal my ice
88 birds in the trunk, Jerry Rice
You can't do that real nigga shit
Know some young niggas, eleven, walkin' 'round with the Emmett
I can buy that car, I know that you can't
I can buy the bar, I know that you can't
I can afford your bitch, I know that you can't
I can afford my wrist, I know that you can't
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't

I'm goin' through it, my nigga ain't even loyal
He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'ma always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it

I'm goin' through it, man this shit so crazy
'07, lost my brother, 15 years in them cages
Now my grandma rest in peace, that was my first lady
Thousand dollar specs on my face to block the haters
Goin' through it right now but still chasin' the paper
My bitch fucked the whole team, I never should have saved her
And now I'm goin' crazy, cause I'm just goin' through it
I still walk around with Rugers cause I like to shoot 'em
I thought I loved that bitch to the mothafuckin' core
I bought her Jimmy Choos, I bought her Juicy Couture
I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood whore
And now she tryna ride with me cause now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, money got me in a Porsche
Money, money, money, money got my fingers sore
I'm rollin' up a 3-5 blunt look like a core
Feds watchin' me, still servin' J's, I'm paranoid

I had to go to Wal-Mart and collect some Arm & Hammer
And go hard in the kitchen, finessin' nothing but tickets
Do numbers water whippin', Young Quavo, yeah I did it
My bitch, she smashed the whole team, damn that ho too friendly
So you know when I sign that deal, got to know I ain't buyin' that ho no Bentley
Ain't seen him in two years, now he wanna come around, gotta know somethin' fishy
And I told my momma if somethin' happen to me, she can have my riches
Young Quavo, ain't leavin' my wealth to none of these bitches
Cause once you dead and gone, she'll have another nigga in your kitchen
Water whippin', show her how you did it
If I get her the Bentley, she'll have another nigga in that Bentley

I've been goin' through it, shit been crazy
2000, lost my cousin, cried like a baby
My ancestors been goin' through it, back then in slavery
Now the time faster, I am the master
Could've been me back then, nigga woulda been like "Fuck your master"
My name Takeoff, I am NASA
Every move I make, is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I'm an ambassador
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
Remember back in '07, almost lost my mom
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
If you talkin' 'bout that bread, then I want every crumb
Runnin' to the money like I'm in a marathon
Foreign bitch, pop a zan like she pop a gun
Smokin' on that kush, it smell just like an underarm
And the check say it wanna get married to my thumb
Goin' through it like a nigga locked up with no bond

I'm goin' through it
2000, lost my cousin RiRi, rest in peace
'07 lost my big bruh to the feds
Free Player Made
Just lost my grandmomma
Rest in peace Sally Smith, I love you
Done took so many losses, it's only right that we win1Embed

My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like woah!
(Let me talk, Meek Mill)

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now
You might also like
All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
I sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
Camera rollin', Quavo Spike Lee
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
If you in our trap, you gon' buy some ki's

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

Young Takeoff, I am a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
And I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick
For that pay my, nigga turn to Predator
I bet you didn't know I was twenty-two
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
Me and my son identical, seventeen years old
I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, "give a nigga some faith"
Now when I wake up I look at my lake
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know, M&Ms)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say, bricks)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater (splash), you don't know how I'm feeling right now37Embed

The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'
My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin
I got 15 bricks I'm finna drop
In there right next to that carbine
I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl (with you)
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy? (wealthy)
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor? (professor)
I don't know how you feel can you tell me? (can you tell me?)
I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me ('til you tell me)
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?

Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She lookin' at me like she want somethin'
Can't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses, baby girl you trippin'
(I don't know how you feel can you tell me?)
I know why you came in this club tonight
Looking for a nigga that's gon' change your life

I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl (with you)
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy? (wealthy)
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor? (professor)

You don't want no problems with the Grim Reaper
When it come to money niggas get evil
I'm not gon' let up like I'm DG Yola
Double seals from Minnesota
Guiseppes and now they walking on komodos
No vending machine but I'm selling that coca
Yola, payola, yola, payola
Payola
The feds they ran in my trap
But they didn't find the bricks cause they was in the sofa

Yola, payola, payola, payola
All I ever need in my life, payola

Fell in love with the lean I'm attached

And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep

Don't fall in love with the fishes
Do not get drowned in the water
I don't wanna call her no more
Cause my niggas think I'm gone spoil her
I can't fall in love with the fishes
Young nigga I think I did it
I'm in way too deep with the digits
Falling in love with the Benji's

I play with the fishes, no flounder
I sip on the Actavis, it keep me grounded
I was missing one thing but I found it (Money!!!)
You niggas ain't shit

Trap money, me and my dogs spend it

Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y’all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

Remember the days with the pocket rockets
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket
It’s a million dollars in the corner pocket
I just share the rock like I’m John Stockton
African diamonds, Olajuwon, Houston Rockets
My niggas they got 'stendos on their guns, they go up out it
Ain’t no need to talk about it
Megaton trucks, it don’t weigh enough
Had to take out the plug, he was switching up
You mad cause your label do finger fucks

Gas off in the back of the spinner bus

Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition
Lupe said that Activis been discontinued
Double cup, a nigga still be sipping
Got a plug out in Mississippi
Wrap it up, ship it to Finland
I trap out the bando, don’t trap out the trap house
And whatever you with, we with it

Beat 'em with it, I'ma go and beat 'em with it
I won’t ever leave it in her
Bullets hit the Sprinter, you sweeter than a cinnamon
I’m checking my agenda, you niggas acting feminine
Had enough to pay my dividends, Migos I’m a citizen
It was evident we had to stay passionate
Pissing diamonds accident, my money is immaculate
Hit 'em with the tackle
Pull out the chopper, not fronting I’ll rush 'em
Sipping on Actavis in my blood vessel
I am not a mason but I’m rocking Margiella’s
Higher than a motherfucker, just like a propeller
I’m riding in the Mulsanne, Bentley got umbrellas
My plug’s too far so I tell a nigga mail 'em
Your bitch look like she want to fuck some
That’s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (Hit it!)
When a nigga hit the plug
When a nigga hit the trap and I hit 'em with the pump
Look at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit 'em with the uh

Nigga talking crazy like he want to buck
Hit him with the uppercut, I make him knuckle up
Pull up in the Lamborghini Murcielago to
Make your bitch buckle up, turn me up
Sipping on poison ivy, but nigga check my double cup
My brothers know Isley, tweety bird tweeting in my Bentley truck
Nigga talking bout a check then Imma run it up
Shots fired at my sprinter bus, bap bap bap, graow
Nobody got hit, it was ten of us
Touch down at Coachella and they pulling up
Pick up the vector, then I point it up
Start busting, ain’t no need to load it
I hit the gas, take out their expedition truck
Your bitch look like she want to fuck some
That’s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (Hit it!)
When a nigga hit the plug
When a nigga hit the trap and I hit 'em with the pump

Run with the sack and I go hit the hole
They calling me Quavo McFadden, no John Madden
I run the game
Look at my house, take a look at my ring
Walk in the North and I know I got rank
Pull up in the North and remember the day

And I took me a flight to the Everglades
I told 'em that day that it was my way and never get paid of 50k

At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out "Free Actavis"
They talking bout that Actavis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental

I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewelry, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five

Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the .44, make him fold
Chattahoochee River where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the forks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank take little bank

And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me

Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline: that's my motherfucking testimony
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga with a pot of gold like a leprechaun

I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman

If he want to die, know my squad gon bust him
If they ain’t with us then my nigga fuck em
It’s a struggle in my hood, blue Benjamins, I touch em
RIP to Mike Brown, I heard my nigga fuck with us
Middle finger to the police dare them niggas fuck with us (Fuck 12!)
I got all these chains, I’m representing slavery
Only listen to my god and mama, that’s who made me
When my brother  called my phone, that shit was crazy
RIP my brother Pistol Pete, let em know we made it
Mama told me that she can’t visit me in the pen
She want to break me out and I can’t see her going in
I swear to god you might ain't seen it
But if you been through the struggle I know you feel this
You might also like
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

See the struggle is a motherfucker
Nigga tryna hit me for my chain, but I ain’t gon let him touch it
Go to any state, walk through your hood and I ain’t got to tuck em
Swear to god if you touch my brother I ain’t gon hesitate to bust ya
Niggas see you getting money, plotting, tryna take it from ya
It’ll hurt you if you know your right hand man, he telling on you
Break down me a Backwood, rolling me a blunt of marijuana
OutKast in my Backwood, young nigga smoking on Stankonia
Remember plugging up that George Foreman
Early in the morning eat leftovers
I had to warm it, now a young nigga eat steak and shrimp at Benihanas
I remember ten piece chicken nuggets from McDonalds
I remember mama said get up, go get that money
Stand solid, never let another nigga take it from you
I told you mama, now you got that mansion that you wanted
I came a long way from renting the Audi, now I own it
Rest in peace Ree-Ree and Pistol Pete, the top is lonely
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

First free my brother, we used to build the mansions in the house with covers
He used to beat me, told me nigga get some muscle
If you can’t beat em then you gonna have to bust em
It was a struggle, grandma dead, man I really wish I could hug her
Migo gang la familia, so fuck the other
I told my mama I got her back when I lost my brother
Locked up for a strap said I wasn’t going back and I still got in trouble
If you got the sack then my niggas kidnap, call my niggas, they gutter
Packing the dope, we kickin' in your door, we looking for the gold
Keep the forties on my hip, the heater because the world is so cold
Get the money, fuck the bitches, nigga that’s the number one goal
If a nigga want a pull up then a nigga got to be bold
Five racks, hit him with the chopper, nigga you got to go
You niggas is hoes when the pistol shows, you getting exposed
Givenchy my toe, I came out that bowl, I lived on the stove
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle

They know who the fuck run the city (Nawfside!)
I might pull up with that chopper and extensions
I just let it off, I empty about 50
Mama said, "Quavo don't spend all your Benjis" (mama)
Told mama, "I'm sorry, pockets on infinity" (infinity)
You can ask around, really hit them juugs for the fuckin' pound
Next time you see me, better not ask me for no money now
Never went to school, never thought about Clark or Morris Brown

When you a boss they gon' cherish yah
Investigations, I didn't tell 'em nothin'
December 25th, on the run

15 I got my first Glock 9
It was rusty but it still'd bust a nigga
I was lil' nephew, they wasn't gon' touch a nigga
If I did, my uncles'll bust a nigga
Migo gang, they couldn't fuck with a nigga
Started beefin' with some sucka niggas
Belushi's right there up on Club Drive
It's was y'all side versus Nawfside
Knocked a couple niggas out a couple times
Got in shootouts with niggas a hundred times
Come to your party, we fuckin' it up
Young niggas, we never gave a fuck
Young niggas, 10, 12, 13, on go with a finger point

So you still gon' get hit with the uppercut
Beat a nigga to a puddle, nigga snitchin'

Never got it and I sat on it, nigga, everything I got was sold
Apple Mac, juugin' laptops

Migo Jerz stand around the curb
Used to match up in the hotbox
Hit a juug for some True Religions
And some Robin Denims in a public community
My brother's keepers, Migo we got unity
Bout to fire up at the park right on Harrington

We took off the block, cold, anemic
Touch down on the north and I really feed it
Mama, she told me go get it, get it
How can I not believe that she with it?
She came in my room, caught me breakin' a safe
Then she asked me, "Boy, Quavo what's really in it?"
Down in Miami, the 305
They tried to assassinate us like Biggie
What the hell goin' on?
No time to talk, bustin' back with extensions
Who got the iron?
I'm prayin' the Lord the bullet don't hit one of us in the spine
Open your eyes, stand up and bust with the 5
Stand up and bust with the 5

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
'Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking 'bout where you been at
And why you ain't pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Talking 'bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
'Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though

When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one

So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash
And that taught me a lesson, lil' mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it's too much pleasure
