Iffy, can't decide which one I want
All the girls at the party, come along, it's a party we started (Yeah)
Mixin' drinks, how much? Who knows
I pour one out for dead homies (Yeah, yeah), the dearly departed, baby (Uh)
Ain't missin' the moment, ain't no spillin' (Yeah)
Dude, I been livin', illin', tryna find it then I'm peelin'
You feel it? (Woah) All's good until I hit the ceilin'
Good riddance, I figured I'd be straight, just need a minute, just a second (Yeah)
How it's been on overload in my zone, gone
Nothing else can fix the problem but this herb grown, grown
Yes, that there, it got mе on one (Oh)
Ain't no tweakin', I'm professional
Bеtter give a nigga room, I be back, round two
It's the soldier in me (Yeah), let them fuckers envy (Do)
Goin' 7th Heaven-bound, who goin' trippin with C? (Yeah)
The rager from the dark (Yeah)

Day fades and the sun goes away (Uh)
Same old nigga and the same old pain (Uh)
Ain't much change in me, y'all (Yeah)
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all
Thank God I saw another day (Uh-huh)
But I can't go escape what I have made, nah
Ain't much change in me, y'all (Yeah)
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all (Yeah)

Drop it (Let's go), had me at "Hello", we in the spot
Can not stop it (Yeah), ragin' with familiar, lames think they got it, not (Not)
And you see me twistin' on the low, there he go
Yeah, baby, there he go, yeah, really, really (Oh)
Won't be out there lookin' crazy, hazy, ho (Hello)
And it's like I surf the waves forming in my dome
We keep floatin', hopin', coastin'
Ragin' through the day, sexy baby, turn me on-on (Uh)
Hear me out, hear me, hear me
Come on, ready or not, nigga comin' with it
Come on with the team, hear me, hear me
Oh no, hit 'em up and I'm rippin', rippin', isn't he? (Yeah)
And I'm comin' full-blown to the tombstone (Yeah)
How I'm livin', gotta push it, gotta set the tone (Yeah)
It ain't nothin' to me, baby, say I'm livin' wrong (Livin' wrong)

(Go) Day fades and the sun goes away (Uh)
Same old nigga and the same old pain (Uh)
Ain't much change in me, y'all (Yeah)
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all
Thank God I saw another day (Uh-huh)
But I can't go escape what I have made, nah
Ain't much change in me, y'all (Yeah)
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all (Yeah)
Hey, oh, hey, oh
