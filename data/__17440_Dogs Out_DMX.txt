36 ContributorsDogs Out Lyrics
This is dedicated to (What)
This is dedicated to (The streets)
This is dedicated to

And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out

Started gettin' a little too big for the cage that I been trapped in
Cats new it was a problem, went from robbin' to rappin'
Guns got the clappin', another trip to the morgue
We all know why it's happenin', another bit by the dog
When there's nothin' left to eat, I ate away at my soul
Felt destructive cause I don't give a fuck if I go
I know y'all been told I don't give a fuck about livin'
Killin' other dogs got you cats chasin' Pigeons
Got me itchin to bring back the beast from within'
What I catch I'mma eat, in the streets I'mma win
I've been top dog and I'mma stay top dog
So what the fuck you got to say dog?
You cats play games that dog ain't with
Suck my dick, behind my back dog ain't shit
Well this is it, from now on if you ain't out the camp
We out to vamp, put 'em up against the champ
You bitch
You might also like X2
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out, c'mon c'mon

I don't think you cats see too clearly
If it ain't that you must be deaf, cause y'all niggas don't hear me
But I know I got you scared to death
How many other niggas you know when you see 'em make you hold your breath?
All a nigga did was take a pause
Did a couple of movies and you thought this whole rap shit was yours?
Stop being greedy, when was the last time you gave to the needy
Believe me, I run through niggas like hallways with the cops behind
Give it to a nigga all day cause I pops the nine
Man listen, if you don't wanna see your man missin', man listen
I get dough like a nigga in a up north flick
And still roll like a nigga on some up north shit
The way dog flip out, cats'll never understand
Niggas be like "X I thought I was your man!"
Not!

And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out, c'mon c'mon
This is dedicated to (What)
This is dedicated to (The streets)
This is dedicated to

My dogs is dogs that love to brawl
Bring as many as you got cause we gon fuck 'em all
Dicksucked in the hall
The same shorty thats puttin any work on her knees
I'm duckin her call
A dog is a dog is a dog for life, dog been a dog, dog in your wife
I got kids this age
But let 'em keep talkin' slick and I'm gon put somethin' hot up in his ribcage
 X2
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out, c'mon c'mon

When the dog is out, bitch ass niggas get bit or fucked
One or the two, and I'm not Ja Rule
Feel me? Aight44Embed
