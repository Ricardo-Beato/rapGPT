Not gonna stop
I bet I can't get down to them, them (I can't fear nobody)
I can't love in somebody (I can’t hear nobody), they can't love in nobody (I can't see nobody)
(You really don't understand do you?)
Oh the rain, rain, the rain (Can't compete with nobody)
Oh sunshine (Nobody)
I can't love in somebody (Nobody), they can't love in nobody
(You really don't understand do you?)

Ayy, fear nobody, fear nobody (Not lovin' somebody)
I brought my shotty right up in the party (Lots of lovin' nobody)
No bodyguard, just see the squad and me (Nobody)
What's in my pockets? I brought Ben Franklin with me
What's in my house? 7,000 square feet
My bank account? I swear it's no tellin'
All type of amounts, just so I can spend it
What's all around? Fake niggas act friendly
'Cause I'm on now, gotta keep it near me
'Cause niggas will smile, but really be frienemy
Bitches all act down, but really ain't into me
They just want my account, heard I got them milli's
Can't go like that now, I'ma keep it pimpin'
Pistols all around, opp tryna catch me slippin'
'Member my mama used to whip me
Now I can buy her ass anything
You might also like
Oh the rain the rain the rain, oh sunshine
I can’t love in somebody (Body)
They can’t love in nobody (Nobody)
(You really don't understand do you?)
Not lovin’ somebody (Body)
Lots of lovin’ nobody (Nobody)
Nobody
(You really don't understand do you?)

I don't fear no one
War time, I'm gon' get me one
Where I'm from you gotta walk 'round with your gun
But I made it out, just to get some money
(You really don't understand do you?)
Now I'm ridin' what I want
Fuckin' any thot I want
I be buyin' anything I want
Remember when I was broke?
(You really don't understand do you?)
They thought I was a joke
(You really don't understand do you?)
Dear money, I'm so in love with you
'Til I die, I'ma sing to you
'Cause I love you, I wanna be with you
(You really don't understand do you?)
Not gonna stop
I bet I can't get down to them, them
I can't love in somebody, they can't love anybody
(You really don't understand do you?)
Oh the rain, rain, the rain, the rain, oh sunshine
I can't love in somebody, they can't love anybody
Not lovin' somebody, lots of lovin' nobody, nobody
(You really don't understand do you?)115Embed
