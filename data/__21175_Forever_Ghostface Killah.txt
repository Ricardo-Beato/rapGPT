5 ContributorsForever Lyrics
Yeah, aiyo it's 4 in the morning, I decide to turn over
Pull down your little red drawers and start to kiss you all over
You hope it ('last, forever') I know baby, I hope it ('last, forever')
So I, took off my paisley pajamas I got from St. Thomas
Yo, I love you so much, so let me pay homage
And if you do, yo I promise never break a promise
So can I give you the honors my little Pocahontas?
Play by play, Miss Camay
You like a Zales Diamond in the window, right on display
You just a shining, precised in every curve you cut
And for your daddy, yo, you never have to tuck in your gut
Because I love it like that, stretchmark fat, plus let me show my crunches
To burn it off, just lay right on your back
And let me do my love dance, I pop it to the left
I pop it to the right, I get it all night, come on

Them other chicks must hail to the queen, as I
Put them dudes straight up and check, cuz the queen is mine
(Last, forever, last, forever)
We can be broke, holes in our coat, even still we shine
We got each other through the bad and the best of time
(Last, forever, last, forever)

Yo, yo, I'm lost in love, with nowhere to go
She says I'm a pain in the ass, boy, get to the store
She can say that, cuz we best friends, we play together
She carry my left rib, therefore we pray together
Bury me on top of her, in our graves together
Cuz when she feel pain, I know how to make it better
Talks, some long walks, communication in parks
Understand what she's going through, our listen was smarts
Especially when she's on her friend, I be hoping it leave
I have to bite my tongue, just to keep from arguing
Six days of that is like, who let the monster in
After it's finished then, I can get on top again
Shorty girl's my oxygen, never catch her gossiping
Look it ya'll, this my flower, she gon' keep on blossiming
Long as she is mine, and I am her, we gon' ride the wind
This lady here is all for me, I never have to lock her in
You might also like
Them other chicks must hail to the queen, as I
Put them dudes straight up and check, cuz the queen is mine
(Last, forever, last, forever)
We can be broke, holes in our coat, even still we shine
We got each other through the bad and the best of time
(Last, forever, last, forever)1Embed
