I need to put a lot money on my Uncles books
So I keep making tracks by the fuckin' flood
Now I get a lil fame now all the bitches lovin' us

Philidelphia niggas we all animals
They tell me to slow down I start sippin' mud
And the shit I never was into
Stage divin', 50 thousand in the fuckin' venue
Niggas talkin bout they know the real you
Listen to you're track, say you're trash, but they feel you
Listen to you everyday but try to grill you
Write the worst verses on your instrumental

Same crackers paying me a beatle wasn't in to

Where other people stop, I accelerate
People say they're gonna do shit and they don't do it
I'm going all the way with it
The ultimate rock and roll sacrifice is death
When I die I don't die, my soul goes on
It's another invention
A bottle of death is exciting
Why do I wanna get old and be nothing?
Why do I want to be a poor human being?
I wanna do what I wanna do
And get everything done as quick as I gotta do it
And get the fuck out of there, go on
And then I can accelerate into the next life
And still leave my blood here
To be the blood of rock and roll and still be here
I'll never go away
But when I'm dead I will become stronger on Earth
And I'll become more powerful in the next life
There is no death
If I kill myself that doesn't solve the mission at all
The mission goes on and on and on
And people are so fucking stupid they don't understand that
They don't understand
They think "Yo, okay, you're gonna kill yourself, well that's stupid" Well you're fucking wrong
You're stupid for getting fucking old and boring and ignorant
Just like people on the jury that convicted me
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be part of your fucking boring world
I wanna do what I wanna do
When I wanna end my life I'm gonna fucking end it
And I'm gonna be more powerful for it
And, and, all you people who say what I'm doing is wrong
You're just so fucking insecure
That you don't have the fucking balls to do it
You wanna say you're bad
But you don't really wanna fucking be bad
You just wanna pretend you are
Well I'm really gonna fucking do it
And that's what separates the real rock and roll underground
From the people who wanna just be pretend
You know bands
They come along and follow what I do and imitate what I do
