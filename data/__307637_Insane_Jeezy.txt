It’s the return of the snowman
It’s the return of the snowman
It’s the return of the snowman

Let’s go crazy, insane who’s goin?
As soon as we hit the door I bet that liquor start pourin’
Getcha bread, getcha bands, getcha racks get ya dough man
Without further ado it’s the return of the snowman
Let’s go crazy insane who’s goin?
Soon as we hit the door I bet them bitches start woah’n
Getcha’ bread,  getcha’ bands. getcha’ racks, getcha’ dough man
Without further ado it’s the return of the snowman

Let’s go crazy insane how bout it?
Pull up in something insane, hop out it
Tell the valet don’t worry about my doors I got it
Any problem ever getting hoes? I doubt it
Let’s go crazy, insane you know
Young you on your grind? That’s a big 10-4
Said Jizzle how you rolling on them big 3-0’s?
300 round my neck, that’s about 2 shows
Let’s go crazy, insane I’m saying
Intercontinental suite, yep I’m stayin’
I know you’re used to fucking with them lames who ain’t payin’
Ain’t the type for playing all them games, I ain’t playin’
You might also like
Let’s go crazy, insane who’s goin?
As soon as we hit the door I bet that liquor start pourin’
Getcha bread, getcha bands, getcha racks get ya dough man
Without further ado it’s the return of the snowman
Let’s go crazy insane who’s goin?
Soon as we hit the door I bet them bitches start woah’n
Getcha’ bread,  getcha’ bands. getcha’ racks, getcha’ dough man
Without further ado it’s the return of the snowman

Lets go crazy insane who rolling?
Zip and a half up in here, who rolling?
Just like the boy Carmelo in the paint, can’t hold him
20’s looking like I robbed a bank, can’t hold em’
Lets go crazy, insane go dumb
Get you in that interrogation room, better play dumb
When they ask you what your name is you tell them not a word
If it didn’t come with wings then how the fuck is it a bird?
Let’s go crazy, insane I’m with it
Talking about the bread, Damn right I get it
I know you ain’t got all the bread I’m getting
Since you got enough to go halfway, I’ll split it

Let’s go crazy, insane who’s goin?
As soon as we hit the door I bet that liquor start pourin’
Getcha bread, getcha bands, getcha racks get ya dough man
Without further ado it’s the return of the snowman
Let’s go crazy insane who’s goin?
Soon as we hit the door I bet them bitches start woah’n
Getcha’ bread,  getcha’ bands. getcha’ racks, getcha’ dough man
Without further ado it’s the return of the snowman
Let’s go crazy insane I’m on it
Ass on her is insane, I want it
Heard the dick game is insane, she want it
Liquor got me acting like that, all on it
Let’s go crazy, Louis V straight jacket
Black 40 cal. Yeah it match my 8 jacket
Got something nice for ya in your 8 bracket
Ain’t got but a few left so you better ASAP it
Let’s go crazy insane, wild out
Giuseppe’s are my kicks, yeah I like to style out
Balling so hard that we bound to foul out
Jewelry game frustrating, take some time out

Let’s go crazy, insane who’s goin?
As soon as we hit the door I bet that liquor start pourin’
Getcha bread, getcha bands, getcha racks get ya dough man
Without further ado it’s the return of the snowman
Let’s go crazy insane who’s goin?
Soon as we hit the door I bet them bitches start woah’n
Getcha’ bread,  getcha’ bands. getcha’ racks, getcha’ dough man
Without further ado it’s the return of the snowman1Embed
