Ah
Damn, Snoopy, don't go
You almost thirty years in the game, baby, damn
I mean, who else is gon' do something like that? I mean, damn
You the king, baby
So you know they don't want you to leave, Snoopy

(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I hate to leave but I have to
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh)
I know, I know, baby
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I hate to leave but I have to
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh)

Baby, I'm just a man with good hands like Allstate
And you are now addicted to this lovin'
Let me explore your love 'cause my time is short today
And now you're conflicted, and this is what she had to say

(Ah, I need you right back to me, Snoopy)
I, I gotta go, baby, I'd love to stay
(I need you back in my arms, Snoopy)
You might also like
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh baby, I wish I had time to stay and play but
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh)
You know time is money and money is time, baba
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess we can get together some other time
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh)
'Cause my time is precious, you dig?

Ah, ha, you can't just leave like that, Snoopy
You gotta stay a little while longer
You know that's what they want
Don't go

Baby, I got to go far away for a while
And I don't think you can handle coming with me (No, uh-uh)
You know show after show, and mile after mile
And I don't think you can handle running with me
So I don't think you'll be coming with me

I gotta go (Ah, I need you right back to me, Snoopy)
Look, baby, I got places to be and people to see
(I need you back in my arms, Snoopy)
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I hate to leave but I have to
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh)
I know, I know, baby
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I hate to leave but I have to
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh)

(Snoopy don't, Snoopy don't, Snoopy, don't go)
Oh baby, I wish I had time to stay and play but
(Snoopy don't, Snoopy don't, Snoopy, don't go)
You know time is money and money is time, baba
(Snoopy don't, Snoopy don't, Snoopy, don't go)
I guess we can get together some other time
(Snoopy don't, Snoopy don't, Snoopy, don't go)
I hate to leave but I have to
Yeah, if you wanna go to a record label where the executive producer is all in the videos, rappin', and dancin'
