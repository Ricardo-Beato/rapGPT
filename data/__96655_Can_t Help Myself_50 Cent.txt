14 ContributorsCan’t Help Myself Lyrics
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker

I had a five hundred bags, 14 grams of powder
On the phone with my connect, this shit last about an hour
I need work, I repeat, I need work
My niggas go bizzurk, when the drought come get murked'
When no money coming in is when the guns come out
Why the d's wanna sit in front of my momma house
You know it's sort of like some shit you seen in a flick
Black nine extended clip as long as my dick
They say I'm grimmey, yeah fuck it I line niggas
I show them where your shit at before they take mine nigga (Hahaha)
Don't take it personal, it's just how I grind nigga
Figure, this is a dog-eat-dog world, man
Ebony enemy today I'm tryin' to duck, I got that hover
I heard it'll make you kill a motherfucker (don't stop girl)
I mean you gotta feel it man
She bob and weave up and down you'd be like “I could just kill a man”
I don't fuck with them niggas from her projects
They're on section eight but niggas cars are straight
They ain't out in the day time them niggas roaches
I don't stop down there if I ain't got the toaster
I'm in the six four five hard top, not the drop
Leanin', I see them niggas schemin', dream on
Touch me, shit I wish a nigga would
I'll have my niggas deep, I have them light up they whole hood
You might also like
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker

They said I fell off, my Benz was on the repo truck
Around the same time niggas spot start gettin' stuck (Shit)
I say ‘I ain't know none about nothing'
I'm on the low, niggas really know me for stuntin'
I pull through on low pros, wrapped around deep dishes
That crack money handsome, your bitch blowin' me kisses
You need to check her if you think she could be the misses, damn
I'm starting think you can't trust nobody
I hold my own strap, they ain't gotta hold that for me
And slide by my baby momma crib with the mac on me
Man since her cousin in a car crash died
She said ‘don't drink and drive', I say ‘just drink, don't drive'
I had a morphine dream, I got heroine ambitions
That's big money cooking in that coffee pot in the kitchen
When I say I'm straight, I mean I'm straight
Once the razor hit the plate I double up the cake (hey)

I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker
You'se a purse snatchin' ass nigga man
You'se a petty nigga
I can look at you, I can tell you'se a petty nigga
You'se a car thief
You'se a idibitty nigga, I'm a big city nigga
