10 ContributorsIntro (Trap House 4) Lyrics
Nigga, turn up
Gucci world, nigga
It's Guwop
Zaytoven, cut it up, Sean. ugh
Trap house, bunkin'
Trap house mansion
Yeah, right on Flat Shoals Exit, nigga
Parts unknown, fuck nigga, yeah
It's Guwop, turn up

I'm pourin' fours and shit, I need to just put a deuce in
Car cost four-hundred-thou' and I put a roof in
My nigga pot cook it so good he put his shoe in it
Nigga, it's a gangsta party, why fuck is you in it?
Head bust a microwave, shit, didn't take him two minutes
You know that there's some straps in the club, they let my crew in
I might just do the Michael Vick man and cook it left hand
If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man
I can make the dope do numbers, the Stacey Augmon
I told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rodman
If Gucci Mane got so much money then why he robbin'?
We thirty deep, we cover the streets, nigga, we mobbin'You might also likeEmbed
