4 ContributorsHit ’Em Lyrics
Yeah

You're in the presence of the realest essence
I've been serving lessons since the days of my adolescence
On the Cypress block, young buck holding a Glock
Like we knew it all, not afraid to do it all
Matter of fact, I look back and do it all
I could remember the haters say "The game'll ruin y'all"
What's that to me? Don't give a fuck about a hater
Let 'em roll up like the weed in my paper

They call mе Big Dog riding with the hillbilly
Cuban stallion with the lit Phillie
Rеally became a boss many years back
When I'm gone, hear me, bitches, hold your tears back
We put the bang in bangin', produce the dope we slangin'
You nutless motherfuckers got no chance of hangin'
It's heads or tails when you're flipping the quarter
We ain't slowing down, we're crashing through the border

"Time, one—, one time"
"One—, one time"
"One—, one—, one time"
So let the rhythm hit 'em, just let the rhythm hit 'em
'Cause when you feel it in your soul, it's the sound system
Now turn it up, up, a little louder
Turn it up, up, a little louder
Turn it up
You might also like
We never turn it down, universal sound
When we smoke a pound, take a look around when we touch a town
Out the way, stompin' in my big black J's
Corny motherfuckers get stuck in the maze
We never sucker fools, had enough of you
False friends and loose ends make me wanna snuff a fool
Fuck that, we got another world tour
Touching every shore, from Cali to Singapore

Every day I'm seeing more motherfuckers in the temple
As we rock uptempo instrumentals
I saw my dream in a dream then I woke up
Put the Dream Team together, now we smoke up

"One—, one—, one—, one—, one—, one time"
"One—, one time"
So let the rhythm hit 'em, just let the rhythm hit 'em
'Cause when you feel it in your soul, it's the sound system
Now turn it up, up, a little louder
Turn it up, up, a little louder
Turn it upEmbed
