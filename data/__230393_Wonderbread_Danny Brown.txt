On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
Said "Go get some bread and a pop and come back"
Walk out the door, first thing I see
A dope fiend standing there looking at me
Standing right there, in front of the porch
With a pipe in his hand, in the other, a torch
I kept on moving, ain't worried 'bout that
'Bout a block later heard rat-tat-tat-tat
Next, some niggas from over there shooting
Dog I ain't blinked just kept it a-moving
Block later up, what do I find?
A junkie ho, at left and right, crime
Flagging up cars, getting her bread
And that's what I seen on the way to get bread

On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
On the way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread

On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
Said "Go get some bread and a pop and come back"
Get to the store, first thing I see
Arab dude just staring at me
Looking at me like I'm 'bout to steal
But really though dawg, you need to go chill
Grabbed what I needed, left out the do'
Two little boys in front of the sto'
Fiends running up, running through alleys
I kept on moving, nobody looked at me
Course some niggas stomped on my head
All because they wanted the bread

On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
On the way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
I swear I just want the bread11Embed
