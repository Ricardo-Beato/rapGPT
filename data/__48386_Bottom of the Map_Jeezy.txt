21 ContributorsBottom of the Map Lyrics
Chea
Told y'all niggas I was gonna keep it street nigga
Thug Motivation 101 man, you already know what it is
Let's get it

It's Young Jizzle from the Bottom of the Map
Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap (hey)
I do it for the trappers with the, the, the rocks (ay)
And them O.G. niggas with the, the, the blocks (hey)

I'm strapped up (ay), I'm iced out (ay)
A nigga play, it's lights out (yeah)
Cost a cool quarter million
That's how you'll find me (ay)
Swerving through traffic with them goons behind me (that's right)
You better call your crew, you gon' need help (help)
Whole car strapped, and I ain't talking seat belts (yeeahh)
Red cross nigga, yeah we draw blood (blood)
Whole team got choppas like a bike club (damn)
I don't get mad (mad), I just get money (money)
And laugh at these fuck niggas, cause they so funny (haha)
All a gangsta do is stay fresh (chea)
45 with the Gucci teflon vest (ay)
You might also like
It's Young Jizzle from the bottom of the map
Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap (hey)
I do it for the trappers with the, the, the rocks
And them O.G. niggas with the, the, the blocks (hey)

I'm on fire, the kids out of control
Competition want me to stop, drop, and roll (ay)
Like I had a flame thrower and some gasoline (chea)
Set the city on fire, that's on everything
I walk around like I got a grip in my pants
Yeah that's about 10 stacks, half a brick in my pants (haha)
Fishscale got Papi on speed dial
You niggas getting raped, you still gettin' oil base (yea)
My flow is bananas, the coupe is grape
Evisu jeans with the Bathin' Apes (yeaahh)
Desert on the pillow, choppas by the nightstand (yea)
You can roll the dice, play with your life man (ay)

It's Young Jizzle from the Bottom of the Map
Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap (hey)
I do it for the trappers with the, the, the rocks
And them O.G. niggas with the, the, the blocks (hey)
All that tough talk, you just wastin' your breath
Hit your ass with them things, have you chasing your breath (that's right)
You got loose lips, you better put a collar on 'em (chea)
Black Chanel frames, I spent a couple dollars on 'em (damn)
Whole zip of kush, just to get my mind right
Grab some roll, see the one, get my sound right (ay)
My money come fast, so that's how I spend it (yup)
Trunk sounded like it got a marching band in it (yeeahh)
You in the minor leagues, and I'm a heavy weight
Flipping brick houses, we call it real estate (haha)
Five thousand for the pound, get your curb service (yea)
Sell a lot of grass, like I got a lawn service (ay)

It's Young Jizzle from the Bottom of the Map
Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap (hey)
I do it for the trappers with the, the, the rocks
And them O.G. niggas with the, the, the blocks (hey)2Embed
