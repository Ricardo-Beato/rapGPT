You get in my bed, you twist up my head
I'm changing for you, changing for you
You get in my bed, you twist up my head
I'm changing for you, changing for you
You die with the lie
You lie and a piece of me dies
Inside out, I pray, so much I can take
I'm here for the ride, your pride might be the reason why
We don't even make it to see the days
Woah

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Needed you, wanted you to stay mine

Winter came, you left me 'round my favorite time, yeah
We been down this road, past this street a hundred times
Claimed you haven't eaten in days
Drinking your weight in champagne
You're too busy dancing in the club to our songs
Turned up on my phone, changing your whole tone
Playing with my emotions, playing with my emotions
Playing with my emotions, playing with my emotions
You're too busy dancing in the club to our songs
Turned up on my phone, playing with my emotions
Playing with my emotions, playing with my emotions
Playing with my emotions, playing with my emotions
Playing with my

Inside out, I pray, so much I can take
I'm here for the ride, your pride might be the reason why
We don't even make it to see the days
Woah

Flying places 'cause you know the travel on me
Judging me lately, banging the gavel on me
Friends wanna tattle on me
You put your words together like you getting points for that shit, like you playing Scrabble on me
Your mama the sweetest lady, that apple fell far from the tree
Can't you be honest about your past? Like, how hard can it be?
You know I showed you them songs you been playing all on repeat
You found replacements for me, but you know it's hard to compete
Woah
Calling me daddy, I taught you things that a father can't teach
At the beginning, it felt like you're going harder than me
Then you stepped back on this shit, girl, you hit the Harden on me
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah7Embed
