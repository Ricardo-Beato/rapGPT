47 ContributorsStack That Cheese Lyrics
Uhh, pen to the pad, metaphors on fleek
Took the words that I heard and I put em' to the beat
Press up my tape then I put it in the street
Upload my files and tweet out my link
I'ma be in â€˜em comments just to see what they think
I'ma shoot me a video and put it on the 'tube
I'ma spam IG to get up my views
And DM my favorite artist, say, "I'm gonna be hu-u-uge"
Book me a show that the blogs gonna cover
And they all gon' love it
And the crowd gon' turn up, is anybody out there?
Turn up the mic, we can't hear you out here

Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? Rescue all your babies
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby

Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Not gonna go crazy when I blow up
Bet they gonna go crazy when I show up
Won't listen to the haters cause I know what
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Said I gonna be slow if I pour up
But I'm gonna be poor if I slow up
So I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here
You might also like
Tryna get the tour bus with the studio
It ain't no buts, just bootyholes (uh)
Can't be out here looking like dookie
When you're tryna start a movement and come up on a movie role
Everything's polished
I ain't go to college, I was at the conference
Chopping with the DJs, tryna give my single on replay
And shit up on the game like colonics (colonics)
Hold the phone, take a flick with a fan for me (click)
Hit the strips with a brick of the dance money (strip)
I'm tired, let's switch with the van for me
When I make it by, you'll print the advance money

Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? Rescue all your babies
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby

Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Not gonna go crazy when I blow up
Bet they gonna go crazy when I show up
Won't listen to the haters cause I know what
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Said I'm gonna be slow if I pour up
But I'm gonna be poor if I slow up
So I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here
Hold up, light man, turn the lights on
Came a long way from when I was holding the mic wrong
Something for the hood and a whole lot of white songs
Like I evolved to a whole 'nother life form
I'm just tryna make it happen, don't attack that please
Can't find a job, you can rap at least
Cause that's what I did, I was at that league
Right out of high school, tryna stack that cheese
You was tryna do what? Tryna stack that cheese
You wanna flip burgers, wanna stack that cheese
Make American singles, wanna stack that cheese
Make everybody smile, tryna stack that cheese
Tryna do it for a while, tryna stack that cheese
Talking frequent flyer miles how I stack that cheese
Tryna bundle up the money, tryna stack that cheese
Aye Stack, can we stack that please?
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? Rescue all your babies
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby

Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Not gonna go crazy when I blow up
Bet they gonna go crazy when I show up
Won't listen to the haters cause I know what
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Said I'm gonna be slow if I pour up
But I'm gonna be poor if I slow up
So I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here
