17 ContributorsNo One Else Lyrics
No one motherfucking else, can't be
Know what I'm saying nigga?

Tell him lil' Jeff said that he feel like no one else
Tell him Peewee Longway say he feel like no one else
Tell him big Guwop say that he feel like no one else
Tell him lil' Guwop say that he feel like no one else
When I copped that Rover, man, I drove like no one else
When he copped that Audi, bet he drove like no one else
When he bought a Phantom, bet he drove like no one else
When your ho leave Guapo bet she feel like no one else

I got a bad bitch, she say she feel like nobody
Ain't no vampire, but I got Buffie The Body
Made a 100k off rapping; rapping, that is my hobby
Longway meet the newest member of the goddamn lobby
This monkey bitch crabbing, so I cashed out on her partner
I don't know her, but she say she know the mother of my daughter
I'm not talking 'bout no dad, but we don't have to go farther
I don't care, but if you ever need booze, I take your hard-earned
I look just like my middle name, that ass fat from a mile away
I got my mother's friends, I like that pussy bald head
I'm thugger, major pain, I put that icing on her grill
Just like Johnny Dang, Johnny Dang, Johnny Dang
You might also like
Tell him lil' Jeff said that he feel like no one else
Tell him Peewee Longway say he feel like no one else
Tell him big Guwop say that he feel like no one else
Tell him lil' Guwop say that he feel like no one else
When I copped that Rover, man, I drove like no one else
When he copped that Audi, bet he drove like no one else
When he bought a Phantom, bet he drove like no one else
When your ho leave Guapo bet she feel like no one else

When I'm a Audi, Longway feel like no one else
Got your bitch into her vest, just call me Peewee Longway health
Now roll my weed, stuffed up two grams
Too fucked up, two cups in the Phantom
Lord, that ain't us, that country grammar
Something like a country boy staying in Atlanta
Y'all niggas ain't know we sip mud out the Phantom
Clienteles'll get your ass scrubbed in Atlanta
Skinny Beretta on deuces, don't scrub in the Audi
UK, foreign whip, don't know a nigga like it
Switch-a-roo a UK bitch, I thought a nigga like it
Big Guwop, Guapo,Thug in the posse
Yeen shit like us, cause we going in your pockets
Boot it up, nigga, took off like a rocket
We the plug in the socket
Take a nigga bitch, it's a hobby
Run around the motherfucking lobby
Guapo and Thug, back to back serving in the 'rari
Got racks that are older than Atari. Guwop and the bud
Just finessed the plug out a thousand
The Brick Factory count up a thousand
Sipping mud out the mug, white folk think a nigga wildin'
You'll never see another nigga like it
Tell him lil' Jeff said that he feel like no one else
Tell him Peewee Longway say he feel like no one else
Tell him big Guwop say that he feel like no one else
Tell him lil' Guwop say that he feel like no one else
When I copped that Rover, man, I drove like no one else
When he copped that Audi, bet he drove like no one else
When he bought a Phantom, bet he drove like no one else
When your ho leave Guapo bet she feel like no one else

They say I walk like cash, and I talk too fast
Girl to the mall yeah I bought her two bags
Gucci Mane tryna sell more houses
Donâ€™t give a damn that I used to sell ounces
My block be my trap house, power
Sell out apartments, Section-8 housing
Gucci is the God, man, you don't want to start it
Have the world saying "Dearly Departed"
All she wrote
Bandanna hanging
Fat lady singing, quote, unquote
I sell dope, I cut coke
Expensive ass boat Imma keep it up afloat
I'm the captain, all aboard
Come on, why you can't afford
If I wasn't rapping, I'd be robbing
That's hard for you to absorb
Florida free, more keys for me
Serve it to you dirty cheap
Dirty dog, dirty drop, so Imma charge you thirty-three
Swagger jack my style, yeah you stole it like a burglary
911 emergency, I keep on making currencies
Tell him lil' Jeff said that he feel like no one else
Tell him Peewee Longway say he feel like no one else
Tell him big Guwop say that he feel like no one else
Tell him lil' Guwop say that he feel like no one else
When I copped that Rover, man, I drove like no one else
When he copped that Audi, bet he drove like no one else
When he bought a Phantom, bet he drove like no one else
When your ho leave Guapo bet she feel like no one else

OK, now when she on that molly she turn to somebody else
She so ready to fuck she tried to do it by herself
I told her that's Versace, watch how you pulling on that belt
And these is Christian Loub, now that's a rack every time I step
I'm with Longway, I'm with Jeff
Just poured up eight up by myself
Pull up in that foreign feature 'rari, hop out and just sit
Touchdown in LA, 1017, God they on jets
I seen Guwop call up Birdman, told 100k a bet
Why every time you see the kid I'm with another nigga's bitch?
All my shooters play with choppers, you can tell they with the shit
I don't give a fuck about her, she'll get fucked then get dismissed
Smoking weed and sipping lean, designer down behind the tent3Embed
