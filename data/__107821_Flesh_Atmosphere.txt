14 ContributorsFlesh Lyrics
We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh

Now when they started to holler, I thought about how a couple dollars in my pocket could've doubled as a power and it could get him out of the situation and help him gain some control
I'm taller than most, but never tower over I don't know if I could trust or if I could sits on my shoulder (Hell no!)
I waste time by talking to the drama, the world was mine but gave it to my baby's momma
It goes one for the cuervo, two for the line, spill that girl and get that from behind
Bobshow Murderous
Insane verbalist, lead protests, kill women and children
Feminine, weak type, beat a brotha down in the middle of the street
With police watchin', full of various toxins, sicker than a slave when he's boxed in
I bring Glocks in, C4 with the clocks in, to watch it function and bubble out your lunch

We've been listenin to the vermin, squirmin
Tryin to find a way to get the words in
Twisted space through a missile at the middle of existence, missed it and hit its face
That's my place, give it back
Didn't react, too busy choking on the fat
Follow for now, swallow this spit
You velvet you get ripped
Gift of gab, this mic gets grabbed
Life gets dragged like racist lip stick on men's faces
Complacent as a passive racist
Pathless makeshift, glass knife
Aim for the face lift
I wanna break shit, run up and take shit
I can't take it, runnin' a space ship
Escapism, great livin'
You might also like
Yo, man, how you doin' man?
I'm chill I'm chill
You lookin' like you doin' pretty good, man
Nah, I ain't doin' that well actually
I was wonderin' if I could borrow a dollar
Nah you can't borrow shit!

We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh

Can I run up in the settlement
Should I change you like the government
Burn rhymes like sniffin' on double-mint
Make troubles then I blow off suckers then
Bourgeoisie brothers talk about sufferin'
Burn rubber in a silver Delorean
We aim to win, made to end
Fraudulent styles but you play em again
The face card!
Mimic of an action-figure
Embedded in the trash can
Last stand on an ocean of sweat on a path to the sun, how close can you get?
Must be high off the cost of livin'
The life of rhythm, get lost in the vision
Toss that fish in a lake of snakes
Self and Slug came and caught the brakes
Hell - been through it
Jail - seen
Melanin brothers like chalk on pale
It's all good from time to pale ale
Had 50 G's sent straight in the mail
I keep that on stock for all hard rocks
We camouflaged stone cold
Don't stop cause your songs on
You could crip walk before gettin' laid straight on a futon
I got screws gone
Members of my crew gone
Bustin off in the center til the roofs gone
I'm too strong, dealing with snakes on the regular
Take 10 shots to the jugular
Come on, order the special, I dare ya
Get served that riddle that kills your character
Cuttin' at the beams with a hacksaw, on a camel's back
Killin' yak through the last straw
I'm glad y'all made it, now let's see how far we can take it
Already heard that joke about how shit flows
Now get off the mic and get off the coke!

We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh
We came here to slit your throats
You came here to sniff some coke
Kingdoms fall like all the rest
Cuts through soul and cuts through flesh3Embed
