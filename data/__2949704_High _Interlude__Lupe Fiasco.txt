26 ContributorsHigh (Interlude) Lyrics
See this shit go 'round and 'round
Hope you get up to speed and you're alright
All I ever wanted was the dove view
And all the people elevated, stay high
High, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
More than high, high, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
You might also like
It drops without
Then without doubt I'm without drought
How else could a spit out bout
Swat at bats, without outs?
Rain delay
What's that I came to say? Get it wet like Training Day
With no drain away, you with it yet, they ain't related
Lupe got him an H and K
And handle that Heckler, Kramer way
Rain delay
Aight, nigga, put the game away
You mean like rain delay?
She said, "If I pop it then you gotta pay me"
So I make it rain for the ladies
Off that, skin where mosquitoes can't walk at
Off course, we ball with hoes
In the club, I golf that
But ball back, games where it rains and they halt that
We gettin' cold, better salt that
In my brain, it is stormin'
When it rains, it is pourin'
Spit out 'bout, swat at bats
Commissioner Gordon, not a sportsman
Your reigns, not important
But I'm Jordan
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
See this shit go 'round and 'round
Hope you get up to speed and you're alright
All I ever wanted was the dove view
And all the people elevated, stay high
High, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
More than high, high, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
Why I always gotta say it for you?
Why you be as quiet as a DP with an oral?
Why on TV it's adorable?
In 3D it be horrible
Somethin', somethin' stored you
It's like sayin', look, Duval too tall
Or the cue ball is too small
I make two fall in the pool hall
And my new car I carpool
You all finna carnival
Through balls, think about to fall
Get a new doll to my boo, aw
High, more than high, high
Sweet
High, more than high, high
Sweet
High, more than high, high
Sweet
High, more than high, high
Sweet
Enough room for you niggas to eat, deep
That's a keeper homie, whole lot of square foot to sweep
I clean, trampoline, flow lift you off of your feet
Tell your king pass the throne or I'll kick you off of your seat
Like a drummer, I'll kick you off from your seat
Like a drum kit, kick you off with my feat

High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high3Embed
