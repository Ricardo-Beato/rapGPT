I'm not sure anymore, 'ymore
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true

I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you (Uh)
I'm just gon' say good night

Good night
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday, like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And I'm the lil' kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade 'fore I get to get a hold of that
Man, I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man (Man), I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say "Hi" to
People you never got a chance to say "Bye" to
Maybe you could pull 'em up outta your dreams
Into real life (Real life), if you try to
So close (So close), but so far (But so far)
And so far (And so far), no cigar (No cigar)
We can't dwell on the past, all we got is today
So I'ma live like it's no tomorrow, no goodbyes (Goodbyes...)

I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gon' say good night

Uh, to you
If I part, my art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
My art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical

I don't wanna say goodbye, to you
So I'll just say good night, to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gon' say good night
I'm not sure anymore, 'ymore
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I'm not sure anymore, 'ymore
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I'm not sure anymore, 'ymore
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I'm not sure anymore, 'ymore
Who is knocking at my door, door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true32Embed
