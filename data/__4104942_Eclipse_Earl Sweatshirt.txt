Bear arms
Take no prisoners (Yeah)
Just make more chips and whip the brakes off nigga's shit
(Straight on 'em)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say goodbye to my openness (Yeah), total eclipse
Of my shine that I've grown to miss when holdin' shit in
Open my lids, my eyes say my soul is amiss (Soul is)
The signs say we close to the end (Close)

My mindstate sober, I'm bent
Over the pit, pokin' the flames
Hopin' I don't total my shit, that's me though
Play the game, no cheat code
Had to dish 'em a free throw
Your mouth runnin' when you depose (Facts)
Facts, it's rugged on the peak
Don't stumble, serve culinary treats, bro (Please)
The herd hungry, gotta eat (Woah)
Why it's so muddy in the creek, poet?
Three foes comin' by the fleet (Bro)
Keep low, peace, preach
It ain't so sunny by the motherfuckin' beach
The say-so gunner phone number on the screen (Ah)
Keep low, can't nobody see me sleep
I make more money on my motherfuckin' feet
Yeah, uh (Straight on 'em)

We take no prisoners
Just make more chips and whip the brakes off nigga's shit
(Bear arms)
Take no prisoners (Yeah)
Just make more chips and whip the brakes off nigga's shit
(Straight on 'em)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say goodbye to my openness, total eclipse
Of my shine that I've grown to miss when holdin' shit in
Open my lids, my eyes say my soul is amiss (Soul is amiss)
The signs say we close to the end (Close to the end, yeah)10Embed
