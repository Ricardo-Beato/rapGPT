9 ContributorsNever Too Much Money Lyrics
Yeah
Listen to this track, bitch!
Brrr!
Yeah, ah-yeah boy
Yeah, ah-yeah boy
Listen to this track, bitch!
Ah-yeah boy

I can't stop, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Never too much, never too much money
I woke up ballin', and I went to sleep stuntin'
Never too much, never too much money
I can't stop, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Never too much, never too much money
I woke up ballin', and I went to sleep stuntin'
Never too much, never too much money

Hundreds, small-face, big-face, hundreds
Not a ball player but got baseball money
Grand slam, home run, Gucci Mane coming
Drumma Boy on the track, too much money
Never too much, never too much money
G4, Gucci Mane traveling cross-country
Never too much, never too much ice
You'll never see another watch like this in your life
And it's never too much, never too many whips
With the Britney Spears guts and the Fantasia lips
Offset Asanti's with the Fantasia lips
Dually truck, shawty, with Alicia Keys hips
You might also like
I can't stop, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Never too much, never too much money
I woke up ballin', and I went to sleep stuntin'
Never too much, never too much money
I can't stop, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Never too much, never too much money
I woke up ballin', and I went to sleep stuntin'
Never too much, never too much money

Hah! I make it rain on Rihanna
Rain so much she had to get an umbrella
Need a Beyonce to drank what I drank
If you freaky like Lil Kim, then you think like I think
Hah! Do you see what I see?
Tell BET Rocsi need to get mean
Swagger through the club looking just like money
My little boy one, but his shoes 400
With tax, better yet, 450
Gucci all red, so he's shittin' on the infants
He shittin' on the infants, Gucci all red, man, these shoes 450

I can't stop, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Never too much, never too much money
I woke up ballin', and I went to sleep stuntin'
Never too much, never too much money
I can't stop, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Never too much, never too much money
I woke up ballin', and I went to sleep stuntin'
Never too much, never too much money
Gucci!
I'm ballin' like the Mavericks with all this money
40,000 - all hundreds - made it last Saturday
Made it rain on a Hawks player last Monday
Dropped 40 points, sold him like it wasn't nothing
Indiana Pacers, Marquis Daniels
Did a feature with me, gave me 40,000 cash man
Man..man, I feel like Strahan
Just won the Super Bowl, trap going mayhem
Never too much, Gucci gonna show up
Drumma Boy and Gucci Mane, shawty fit'na blow up
I mean shawty fit'na to blow me down
40 goons with me. Why they here? Just to hold me down

I can't stop, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Never too much, never too much money
I woke up ballin', and I went to sleep stuntin'
Never too much, never too much money
I can't stop, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Never too much, never too much money
I woke up ballin', and I went to sleep stuntin'
Never too much, never too much money

Listen to this track, bitch!
Huh, ah-yeah, boy, ah-yeah
Ah-yeah, boy, ah-yeah
Ah-yeah1Embed
