7 ContributorsJust Like I Want Lyrics
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Going and cop the coupe and trick it Just like I want
Get some extra grams off the blow, Just like I want
Told jewelry make my new piece, Just like I want
Shawty put the ? Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Anytime I call the plug he pulling up Just like I want
If I wanna buy the donk I trick it out Just like I want
I’m a go and buy the coupe just to score extra points

Eveytime I call the plug he pulling up Just like I want
If I wanna buy the donk I trick it out Just like I want
I’m a go and buy the coupe just to score extra points
I been hustling from day 1 doing Just like I want
I get my check off the chopper deck
Pull up in a drop with the head off the top of that
Talking to the jewelry store Pocket full of crazy racks
Pop the chop around the corner beam with the crazy zap Just like I want

Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Going and cop the coupe and trick it Just like I want
Get some extra grams off the blow, Just like I want
Told jewelry make my new piece, Just like I want
Shawty put the ? Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Anytime I call the plug he pulling up Just like I want
If I wanna buy the donk I trick it out Just like I want
I’m a go and buy the coupe just to score extra points

Made my partner go to work told him come through with them things
Tryna count that cash by hand ain't gotta bring out a machine
Keep a remix on the yayo ain't a piece of this no clean
I’mma cook up a ring solid stone with the bling
Got a ring get some head get a brand new coupe machine
Wanna lean, I wanna lean lets get a zip and do our thing
Lets do our flip no trampoline you stack as fall as trees
Ain’t no pressure on my cheese I can spend this shit with ease

Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Going and cop the coupe and trick it Just like I want
Get some extra grams off the blow, Just like I want
Told jewelry make my new piece, Just like I want
Shawty put the ? Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Anytime I call the plug he pulling up Just like I want
If I wanna buy the donk I trick it out Just like I want
I’m a go and buy the coupe just to score extra points

Stretch them grams out bring the lamb out
Hightop Gucci with the lounge out
Inside and I trick the car out when I come out know the kid out
From the way I buy the bar out plenty money when the boy out
Like when Pk when just said God I couldn’t just buy one car bought the whole lot
Then I burt out from the car lot when I turn out doing donuts
Doing burnouts want a donut hit my burnout
I’m quick to tell them bitches timeout
When them racks out bring that pack out
We gone cashout til that pack out
Hit the mall and by the store, get your hoe and throw down
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Going and cop the coupe and trick it Just like I want
Get some extra grams off the blow, Just like I want
Told jewelry make my new piece, Just like I want
Shawty put the ? Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Just like I want, Just like I want
Anytime I call the plug he pulling up Just like I want
If I wanna buy the donk I trick it out Just like I want
I’m a go and buy the coupe just to score extra pointsEmbed
