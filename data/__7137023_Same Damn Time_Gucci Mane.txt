2 ContributorsSame Damn Time Lyrics
Y'all don't wanna play fair
(Sonny Digital)
Ya nah'mean? Ayy, chea!

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye

Fucked your sister and your girl at the same damn time
All these diamonds that I rock could make a bitch go blind
Yella ice, white ice at the same damn time
Walkin’ straight through the club, I don’t stand in no line
And my glasses Jimmy Jewels but I got them Gucci shoes
With a Louis belt and Prada bag, I swear I’m so confused
I shop at Vista Lenox Mall in the same damn day
Spendin’ 10k in future, feel the same damn way
Serve my baby momma brother, got the same ole grind
Sellin’ bricks, sellin’ bales at the same damn time
I get better every year so my flow is like wine
I’m a rapper and a trapper at the same damn time
You might also like
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, ayeEmbed
