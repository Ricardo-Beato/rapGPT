5 ContributorsReflections of C.R.E.A.M. (Interlude 2) Lyrics
So I mean after over 25 years in the game
Man you got over a dozen albums
I mean what do you feel like, or how do you feel like
The game has changed from '93 'til now in your life

Man the game changed 'cause it's a new wave
It's a new wave for children that's up in the game
You know music is different
Radio is different
You know it ain't the same
Like if we would have come out with C.R.E.A.M. right now we never would have gotten played
Because all this would have blocked it
You know I mean even though it would have been dope
But it's like, there's so much other stuff that's out
There's like millions of rappers now
You know what I mean, back then we had to fight for our spot
We had to rhyme for it, you know what I mean
Like now you just go on the computer
And you can do anything and you gonna get views
You know what I mean, even if it's super whack
You might get like 5 million views off of super whack
Just something you doing stupid
You know what I mean so that's the difference
Back then it was like yo this is footwork
You know what I mean you gotta move the albumYou might also likeEmbed
