6 ContributorsSnow Season Lyrics
Yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wassup, turn me up a little bit, ya'll ready, listen lil' nigga
Ridin' in that new thing with the top off
Honda red extra side, nigga hot sauce
Got a mini 14 in case it pop off
Yeah, it's fresh out the pot, so it's not soft

Got three or four baddies with me
And I swear them bitches ain't leavin'
Know two or three niggas that switched up
That's a charge, ya'll fucked up for treason
Took a hundred thousand dollars out the safe
Blow it all for no muthafuckin' reason
Pull up on the whole world with the top down
Middle finger, yeah bitch, it's snow season

First you drop ya top, then ya cock ya Glock
Packin' the tool, we knock his ass out the box
Word to my granny, we kept crack at the spot
Go to Miami, we get it crackin' a lot
Let's speak to J. Lo and shut it down right we gon' Liv
Party at the club took it straight to the crib
Bitch I'm about to drink so much champagne
Got on bout four or five chains, Rick James
Woke up in the morning with a bag on my mind
Black caramel thing, goddamn that bitch fine
Straight to the mall, buy some shit I don't need
Pocket full of paper, yeah the type you don't read
You might also like
I got three or four baddies with me
And I swear that them bitches ain't leavin'
Know two or three niggas that switched up
That's a charge, ya'll fucked up for treason
Took a hundred thousand dollars out the safe
Blow it all for no muthafuckin' reason
Pull up on the whole world with the top down
Middle finger, yeah bitch, it's snow season

So you want million dollars, now you got a million reasons
Won't stop 'til ya crib lookin' like that Four Seasons
Never had a job, yeah I got street money
Rent a room in my spot, yeah you might see money
Might not like it, but you niggas gon' respect it
Started this shit, for the muthfuckin' record
Got bad broad thang, she be havin' mood swings
One time she seen me wit another bitch, her mood changed
Got this other thang, yeah she like to eat sushi
Always bring her homegirls, they be actin' all bougie
This ain't a TEC-9, this a muthafuckin' uzi
Al Pacino, bitch my life a muthafuckin' movie

I got three or four baddies with me
And I swear that them bitches ain't leavin'
Know two or three niggas that switched up
That's a charge, ya'll fucked up for treason
Took a hundred thousand dollars out the safe
Blow it all for no muthafuckin' reason
Pull up on the whole world with the top down
Middle finger, yeah bitch, it's snow season
I got three or four baddies with me
And I swear that them bitches ain't leavin'
Know two or three niggas that switched up
That's a charge, ya'll fucked up for treason
Took a hundred thousand dollars out the safe
Blow it all for no muthafuckin' reason
Pull up on the whole world with the top down
Middle finger, yeah bitch, it's snow season
I got three or four baddies with me
And I swear that them bitches ain't leavin'
Know two or three niggas that switched up
That's a charge, ya'll fucked up for treason
Took a hundred thousand dollars out the safe
Blow it all for no muthafuckin' reason
Pull up on the whole world with the top down
Middle finger, yeah bitch, it's snow season2Embed
