10 ContributorsYour Not Ready Lyrics
Oh, Oh
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit
Nigga
Haha

You say you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one-on-ones
Niggas'll clap you or rat pack you
Either way, your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

Mama baby boy is a killa
Ain't it funny how them guns get to pop for the scrilla?
Four bodies at nineteen, man, I love that little nigga
For five grand, niggas'll air the strip out
For ten grand, niggas'll run up in your house
Have you ass tryna talk with a gun up in your mouth
New York has taught niggas to get money down south
But get knocked in a commonwealth state, your ass out
Fuck the captain, fuck the sarge
Fuck that kingpin charge, bitch
You might also like
You say you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one-on-ones
Niggas'll clap you or rat pack you
Either way, your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit

When my warriors come out and play, I'm Osirus
I eat, sleep, shit and catch niggaritis
And beat niggas down like the turtles on Rikers
I'm a cheap-ass connect with some high-ass prices
I been totin' four-fours and MAC-10s
Since Tim Dog was on Ron G 10
I'm the nigga on the strip that make friends relapse
I'm the nigga on the strip that's a walking G pack

You say you're ready, you're not ready
We don't shoot no one-on-ones
Niggas'll clap you or rat pack you
Either way, your ass is done
When them shells hit you and they split you
You gon' scream like a bitch
In your dreams it don't feel
How it feels when you're hit
I don't bash woman, but I'll throw a bitch in a sleeper
I been this way since Rakim was kicking a speaker
You can fly on holidays like Christmas and Easter
You only wear yellow ice if you piss in the freezer
I'll put your partner in a case for barkin' off of base
You suppose to be getting money, shake that carpet off your face
I'm in the place, top runner in the race
Nike fanatic, spent spring-summer winnin' rings
Look what happened to Ma$e, I hope you see them same light as him
My tape pound from me, put you on tubes and vitamins
I might've been slumped in the G5 drunk and
Thumpin' The Chronic one, ridin' with the trunk shakin'
I'm on the run from a marriage, the ring with the carats
I'm done with the average, give me someone established
I'm performing if they come with the karats
These bitches want my son in their carriage
But want 'em feelin' dumb and embarrassed, bitch (Nigga)

Bummy-ass niggas
None of y'all fucking with us, man (Hahaha)
G-Unit
Hottest niggas out in the streets right now
Tell them niggas
Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo (Hahaha)
The General, 50 Cent, nigga (Yeah, you heard him motherfucker)
Go ahead and scream my name, nigga
Go ahead, say something
So I can fuck you upEmbed
