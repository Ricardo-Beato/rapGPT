44 ContributorsBBD Lyrics
Uh
Let me get that
Let me get that oooh
I get it when I get that ooh
I spend it when I whip that

Flossin' on them haters
It’s that boss - the bitch, that caker
Tricks that’s born to tip that shaker
He's forfeiting all that paper
Niggas coughing off that 8th of-
I wanna hit them vapors
It’s that sporty bitch that game 'em
They calling me Super Sega - hit that!

I’m just really out here livin'
Something like the new edition
They say I’m poison what’s the difference?
BBD - Michael Bivins

All my bad bitches do it, bad bitches do it
All my bad bitches do it, bad bitches do it
All my bad bitches do it, bad bitches do it
All my bad bitches do it, bad bitches do it

I’m just stuntin' in stilettos
Holla playa hello
All them dusty bitches jello (jealous)
I'm rising, I split that ghetto
It’s that time, look at that bezel
Dining with that cello
Freaky-fine, a China fellow
He's pumpin' banana yellow, get that

Let me get that
Let me get that oooooh
When I spit that, ima spit that oooooh
When i hit that, lemme hit that ooooh
I get it when I get that oooooh

I spend it when they get that oooh
I spend it when I get hthat oooh
Fine, feminine - I whip that woop
Dram-Drama? Niggas get that deuce
Ram-bam-a-lamma flip that loot
Gam champ - her jiggy jam on loop
Damn fam, what ya man gon' do?
I get it when whip that woop
I spend it when they spend that loot
Wilding wit my bitches
I be styling with my bitches
Pretty eyes and long extensions - they smiling in all them pictures
I be rising with my bitches
Riding with my bitches
We the finest of them bitches
It's diamonds, we diamond district!
Get that ice nigga, ice nigga
Bitch wanna freeze like white winter
She needs the g's, that price went up
She need to see that bright shimmer
He wanna get that nice
Wanna fit that slice, want to see that spice simmer
She want it with that white nigga
Peachy-pinky-piped nigga
Be's what it be's, little breeze by the sea -az, been about that life nigga
Tits out with your wife, nigga
I'm bringing out the dyke in her
XOXO fine scissor sister, 69 - whip that
I get it when I get that
I spend it when I whip that
Let me get that
Let me get that oooooh
When I spit that, I'm a spit that oooooh
When I hit that, let me hit that ooooh
I get it when I get that oooooh
I spend it when I spend that oooh

I’m just really out here living
Something like a New Edition
They say I’m poison, what’s the difference?
