13 ContributorsI Like Dat Lyrics
Can I speak on how I feel y'all?
Let my heart do the talking
Listen up princess

I wake up in the morning, take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eyes
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you been gone
I have been all alone
But alone is steroids, 'cause it made me strong
Girl, hair gone in the wind
You cheated on God's son, baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rearview
And I put that ring on your finger, I was all in
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been
Goddamn
You might also like
And now I'm by myself, but
(I like it)
Damn, she left me all by myself, but
(I like it)

Yo
I love my niggas, no homo
I swear I hope they all get cheese, like Digiorno
And something 'bout the Hot Boys that you don't know
I got a lot of love for 'em that I don't show
And B.G. been my nigga since the front do'
I hope Chopper City Records blow, fo sho'
And me and Juvey never really got along
But you still would let your nigga come get on your hottest song
Damn, I fuck with ya for that
I fuck with ya Lil Wack
And me and Skip go back
When you see a real nigga you gotta tip your hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case
After I heard him dissing me on the mixtape
'Cause he's locked up and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry about than me
I ain't trippin'
Y'all niggas left me by myself, but I can't front
(I like it)
And so, now I became the President
Of the spot y'all left me at
A lot has changed, but, I can't front
(I like it)15Embed
