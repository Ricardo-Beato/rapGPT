Ayo, Quas
Ayy, Quas, pick up the fuckin' phone, it's your cousin Melvin, bro
Listen, man, Madlib out here doing records with Logic and shit
Don't nobody give a fuck about that, don't nobody want that shit
We need Quas back, man, come on, come on, man
Fuckin' rap, bro, what the fuck you doing?

Yeah
Madlib, my man, come the fuck back, damn
Show the people that you understand what I'm sayin'
Quasimoto flow, toe-to-toe with any spitter
Hip-hop needs you in this company, the Black John Ritter
In the lab, you said, "People don't wanna hear my shit"
I should smack you, brother, they revere that shit
Come back, run it back, neutralize 'em like Men in Black
From Stones Throw to Madlib Invazion
Ask any fan on the street, they'll say your shit is amazing
The G.O.A.T., a legend, a god amongst men
Greatest producer alive, number one out of the ten
Egon would say that shit'll prolly make you feel uncomfortable, don't it?
But it might bring you back, won't it?
Quas and an MPC is no match for any opponent
One of the greatest alive, nobody could argue
Just come back, man, the rap cats would never dog you
I had to write you now or else I probably never would
I don't want you full of regret like, "Damn, man, I should"
I don't think you understand what you instilled in me
Hip-hop from Jaylib to Madvillainy
You are the sound of our ancestors
Come back and rap, man, it's killin' meYou might also like2Embed
