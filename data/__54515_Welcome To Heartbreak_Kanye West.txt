My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card, card
And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before

My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo
And I, and I can't stop
No, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, I can't stop
No, can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it
Ooh, ooh, oooh
Hoo-hoo, ho-ho-hoo
