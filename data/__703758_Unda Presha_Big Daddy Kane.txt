4 ContributorsUnda Presha LyricsSomebody get the God Kane, I know he'll back you up
Kick a rhyme spectacular, think the nigga think he Blacula
I seen somebody trying to get him with sunlight
Somehow it wasn't done right, then he just laced him with one bite
Go for the jugular vein, that's my new thing
How did he do it with two fangs, think they were gold like Wu-Tang
Your luck has been changed, you're left strucken with pain
Well good for your ass kid, that's what you get for fucking with Kane
See, I creep on MCs like po' nine and take rhymes the whole nine
To dig in you rappers like a coalmine
Now look what I dug me, somebody better turn me off or try to unplug me
Ooh it's starting to get ugly
Don't miss this, hold on with a clenched fist
As I tongue the microphone down just like a french kiss
Relentless with lyrics that be brutal, hip-hop I stay true to
Put it on you like voodoo
Chorus
Unda presha, niggas unfold and felt the heat
Possessed with the Brooklyn techniques we freak
Ayyo Kane, hit us off with that shit one time
They can't believe it, infatuated hardcore rhymes
When you digging out your girl from behind, you're gonna find
The reason that her eyes are closed, Black Caesar's on her mind
Your royal smoothness, honeys out there know how it goes
Even cabesa de pollos that habla Espanol
Dig this now, run for your life to get away but none do
Even if you escape just tell me who can you run to
Test the stupendous, tell me what was you to gain
Internal bleeding due to Kane
Boom bow bow, ooh the pain
Nobody's equal, keep it lethal and diesel, to see to the people
And reach your cerebral cause that's how we do
The pain gets inflicted, fake MCs get evicted
Face it, truth of the matter is just that I'm too hard to get with
Since days of Pro Keds, I shined over mad heads, roll up on you like the feds
Rip your whole set to shreds
A crash or a wreck, because I mash for respect
Only thing I want to know now is, is this cash or a check?

Ain't no question, I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion
Not the one for testing
Come mess with and end up with your chest split
No not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act
I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer
Competition minds up in the state of paranoia
I said if you're scared get a dog
So by tomorrow you'll probably see twenty rappers walking with Rottweilers
Your gimmick is primitive and impotent
You won't win with it so limit it
Before I make your body start to hemorrhage
Just when you thought that you was burning me
You found yourself bleeding internally
Now you heads is learning see
I stay in there sincere
You commence prayer, your heart begins fear cause there ain't no wins here
Huh never kid, even with leverage
I can rock your headpiece worse than the wop ever did
I damage a amateur with a lack of stamina
Petty grammar will leave you for the medical examiner
You come talking about some stay real
I have you hitting high notes like Curtis cause of pain that you may feel
So many tried to infiltrate but couldn't penetrate
Now they disintegrate as money generate
From who? The living legend, true indeed, hip hop veteran
Whipass is probably out there but I swear I never met him
Give me mineEmbed
