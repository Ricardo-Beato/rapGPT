56 ContributorsLove Thy Enemies Lyrics
Love my enemies, love my enemies, oh, oh
Makin' love to the enemy, makin’ love to the enemy, oh, oh, oh

Roses, roses I sent, they forever died, oh
Chosen, frozen, livin' in paradise, woah

I've been possessed, they wanna take my soul
Save my flesh, I’m in need of your love
Tracin' back to orbit is where we met, met
You wasn't considerate to how I was feelin', yeah
How am I explain this to my children?
I need to find the words without soundin' foolish
Caught in temporary illusions, yeah
Treat me like property, but you pursuin'
I need angels, I need angels, yeah
I need answers, who I can't trust?
Fighting through breakups, revelation
Complicated obligations

Roses, roses I sent, they forever died, oh
Chosen, frozen, livin' in paradise, woah

Love thy enemy
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death, oh, oh3Embed
