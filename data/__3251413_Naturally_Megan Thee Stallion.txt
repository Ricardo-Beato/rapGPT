15 ContributorsNaturally Lyrics
Bikini bottoms and bikini tops
You can catch Thee Stallion drinking out a Henny bottle, lookin' hot (Ayy, yeah)
Hot girl, hot girl, hot girl, hot girl

Shades on in the party, am I lit? Bitch, of course (Duh)
H-Town hottie, I'm the black Regina George (I'm the black Regina George)
Ex tried to play me like a ho (What?)
I put him on the block 'cause that just make him want me more (Ahh)
And I don't wanna talk, I put my phone on DND (Yeah)
I'm with my other nigga, tryna creep like TLC (What?)
And when he tryna start, I push that button, E-N-D (Uh-uh)
And only time I see him, when I'm tryna get some D (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah)
I don't wanna call, I don't wanna text
Tryna set me up, put me on the net (I ain't goin')
I don't do no pics, I don't shoot no vids (Hell nah)
And you ain't gon' see my name in no GM (Nope)

I be doing me, hanging lowkey (In the back)
They gon' do the most, I'ma keep it G (Keep it player)
I don't say a word but I'm gettin' seen
Everything I do, I do it naturally, ayy, yeah

Naturally (I'm a star)
Naturally (I'm that bitch)
Naturally (Check my 'fit)
Naturally (Do what I want)
Naturally (Stalli)
Naturally (I'm the shit)
Everything I do, I do it naturally
You might also like
I was never meant to live life like a simp
Fuck getting skimped, I'd rather be a pimp (I'd rather be a pimp)
And every enemy I had started as a friend
They wanna see me shine but not harder than them
So I stepped out, body like pow (Voila)
If he runnin' with that money, you know Megan in route (Yeah)
Got your daddy drinking out the bottle, he wanna be down
He be actin' like a kid, running from your mama house
I'm sexy and we know that ain't a secret (Nope)
Slicked back ponytail like I'm Puerto Rican (Yes ma'am)
Baby hairs on, "Yes ma'am, bitch, kill it" (Girl, kill it)
I'm so bad, I look like a super villain

I be doing me, hanging lowkey (In the back)
They gon' do the most, I'ma keep it G (Keep it player)
I don't say a word but I'm gettin' seen
Everything I do, I do it naturally, ayy, yeah

Naturally (I'm a star)
Naturally (I'm that bitch)
Naturally (Check my 'fit)
Naturally (Do what I want)
Naturally (Stalli)
Naturally (I'm the shit)
Everything I do, I do it naturally
Hot girl, big bucks
Pull up in that, "What the fuck?"
Bad bitch, super model
Make your nigga suck my pussy like a baby bottle (Mwah)
They be tryna block my blessings, I'm like AND1 (Woo)
And I bet your nigga is a fan, huh (Ahh)
He wanna ride 'cause I'm cooler than a fan, huh
I'm so hot, he wanna kiss on my tan lines
Fine and I'm slim (Slim), I be in the gym (Yeah)
I know some mad hoes built like M&M's (Built like M&M's)
And a couple of these dudes with these damn slim jims (Uh-huh)
Buying big magnums, tryna fuck you backwards
But I like it with the lights on (Lights on)
I need to see if that thang really hang long (Hang long)
And he say I'm a dog, I'ma need a big bone (Big bone)
And if you fall short, I'm a send yo' ass home
Nigga, take yo' ass on

I be doing me, hanging lowkey (In the back)
They gon' do the most, I'ma keep it G (Keep it player)
I don't say a word but I'm gettin' seen
Everything I do, I do it naturally, ayy, yeah

Naturally (I'm a star)
Naturally (I'm that bitch)
Naturally (Check my 'fit)
Naturally (Do what I want)
Naturally (Stalli)
Naturally (I'm the shit)
Everything I do, I do it naturally (Ahh)Embed
