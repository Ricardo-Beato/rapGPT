4 ContributorsGame Speaks On Nipsey Lyrics
I gotta shout out the homie, man
Ay, 'cause Game don’t really endorse nobody, man
But you know, I've been listening to this mixtape for about, about a week now, you know'm’sayin'
Nipsey Hussle, man, like
The next biggest thing in L.A., I swear before God, homie
This dude is like Snoop, Game, Dre, all in one, homie
And, you know, my homie Big U from 60s put me on Nipsey, man
He been in the streets, you see the posters up
Like, he grindin', man
And it made me feel like, like when-when I was first gettin' on, you know'm'sayin' (Right, right)
So look out for Nipsey Hussle
(Nipsey Hussle, there it is, what up, homie?)
And when you say, when, when I talk about his music, I say...
Whenever, whenever Nipsey name come up, just say, "I swear 'fore God! This cat is crazy"
(There it is, look out for my man over there, don’t sleep on him, The Game is sayin’)
I promise...You might also likeEmbed
