14 ContributorsRolls (Rozey) Lyrics
Spent some rolls, on some clothes, aye, aye
And some rolls on some hoes, aye, aye
Them bitches gon' go 'cause my rolls, aye
Pistol with me, it'll go where my rolls at
Got a couple trucks, I ain't got no Rolls, aye
And I like lean not no ros√©, aye, aye
She only wanna fuck me for my rolls, aye, aye
But I play that role like I ain't know that, aye, aye
Rolling up this thrax, this that thoink pack, aye, aye
Rolling off a flat, where my joint at? Aye, aye
Sipping on this Act, that's Karo pack, aye, aye
You ain't sipping lean, and I know that, aye, aye
Rolling with my niggas and we on that, aye
Roll up on your ass like where your rolls at? Aye
I heard you roll with opps, where they post at?
I be rolling like a 18 wheel with 4-5, aye aye
And it got a thirty, and I tote that
Fifty in my forty, I enroll that
Pull that bitch up and I control that
Give his ass the hiccups and I patrol that, aye
Rolled up on a nigga block, come back, call it a re-rock, aye
Niggas at your front door, knockin', guns at your peep hole, aye
I'm busy counting ih-uh, money, the blunts, they be pre-rolled
Roll up, catch a nigga lackin', he gon' need a hero, aye
Roll up with my three rolls and my three poles with my ego, aye
Rolling with all these glos, we got three piece and 'bout three O's, aye
Smoking on all the dope, we roll the dope and roll these hoes, aye
Tryna roll on the Glo, we take your dumb ass on a bumpy road, aye
Rolls in my bank, and my coat, and my draws, aye
Hoes want my life, and my rolls, and my clothes
Niggas want my life, and my ice, them my foes
So I roll with the pipe 'cause I can't trust a soul, aye
Bitch, rolling we gonna be, I ain't had sleep in a week, aye
Chasing that green, fucking things, fucking with the heat-t-t
Bitch, we nosebleed when we see
Rolls all beneath my feet
Rolls in between my teeth
Rolls, when I eat, I feast, aye
Rolling up a blunt of Aiki
With my heat, his night I lit
Pay Johnny Dang some rolls for rolls and diamonds in my Breitling, aye
My mom was a rolling stoner, bitch, I ain't had a dad then
Grandma tryna raise me in a room, rolling D got me indicted
I ain't had to say it like that, aye
Rolling 'round with steel like that
'Cause you see, tote fifty, shit, now we spraying like that
Shouldn't be playing like that
Rolling 'round with your mans like that, aye
No pistol in here like that
Rolled up on your ass like brrat! Aye, aye
Rolling, rolling, rolling, aye, aye
Bitch I'm toting, holding, blowing, aye, aye
Bitch I'm blowing for the moment, aye, aye
Nigga roll up then I'm on 'em, aye
So I roll with my anaconda
Roll with thirties, not no damn Pythons, aye
Police rolling down on me, aye
Least I have my money, aye
Rolling out my mind, aye
Blowing like I'm blind
When I count rolls, bitch, I'm deaf
Made me count rolls with my nineYou might also like1Embed
