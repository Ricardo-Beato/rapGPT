18 ContributorsDa Drought LyricsWeezy F Baby, F ya ladies so quick so fast
No lines, no laughs, just wine and grass
And sometimes they might lie in grass
Whatchu know bout getting coke sucked off my dick then put it in her ass?
I'm nasty huh? But she like that shit though
So I like that trick ho but never wife that bitch, no
But never mind that bitch though, got plenty more
Hen' and Mo', women know.. Weezy Deuce Bigalow
So tell ya crew hello
The game come with the boy, the boy come with the game bitch I'm a Game Boy
She from across the club, I got range boy
DJ let her know I came and she came
White as cane in the Range, drop-drop on the thangs like stop, pop, chop and slang
Yeah mayne, cop, pop, chop and slang where the cops not dropping a thang
