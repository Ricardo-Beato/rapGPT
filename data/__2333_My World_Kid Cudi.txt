Hello, yeah

Uh, little homie, in the room
In-in the room, boy on the moon
(Had-had no-no one) No one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my little homies
One year younger, they ain't get where I was going
Took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely (Hmm)
Lonely in my room
I-I mean me, up on the moon
Entertained myself, laughed at myself
As I grew to be a teen, I disguised myself
Had the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls
Tried every sport just to impress all the girls
Instead of all the ladies, 'cause they talked down
I was too artsy, known to be a clown (Hmm)
(Ah-huh) And now my Facebook poppin'
'Cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit
One day

This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, uh, big homie, made the move
Made-made the move, flew off the moon
Still (Had no-no one) no one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas
All I would wonder is when will my time come
Had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them
Thinkin' 'bout my bosses, yep I hated all of them
Studio at night had me hustlin' to most of them
Nigga, I was late damn near every day
But I'ma be on time when my stars align
When my soul was happy on my Ramen diet
Followed by a loosey, was the meal of grinders
If you knowin' the truth, all you think about is that thing
Always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
Until you meet a kid like K-I
Niggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high
We getting money, mom

This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle
And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all really knew about me
I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle
And none of y'all really cared about me
And none of y'all really cared about me
Now, guess what? I'm all you see, I'm all you see

This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
