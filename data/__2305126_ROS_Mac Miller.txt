Ahem, ahem
Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing?
Just wanna ask you a question, um, have you, have you
Have you been in love, before?

You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should pro'bly take your heels off, 'cause you been runnin' through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under?
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain, these days of rain
You playin' games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still tryna find you, I'm lookin' for you, babe
And I'm still tryna find you, through sunshine or rain

]
I love you

Yeah
You got your stained glass iris, diamond behind your eyelids
Autopilot fly, my heart skip a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy
Love is power, swear there's somethin' 'bout her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl, you know I'm lovin' you just like you deserve it (Ou)
So, baby, make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's... just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug, in love to death, feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream, so fuck the world, it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If her love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah
You might also like
Your love is not too kind to me
You know my love is sugar-sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothin' lasts forever (Nothing lasts forever)
Nothin' lasts forever

Yeah
And she is cool, calm and collected, I knew that you was the one
When I seen ya, leave me breathless, a-okay, I need a second
Day-to-day, give me attention, I want to take care of you
Marry you, somethin' I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you not, you up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession, I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong (Wrong,) everything you do is right (Right)
Let's start a family, hold on to forever, baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy *Woman moans*
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen, look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love, that love was record-breaking
I'm sick of waitin', yeah
Your love is not too kind to me
You know my love is sugar-sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever (Nothing lasts forever)
Nothing lasts forever, ever, ever

So gimme all of your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah25Embed
