May I ask in what way your life is contributing to society as you sit here day after day after day in this dark room, stringing along on that stupid guitar? Have you ever thought about that? What are you doing for the world or for other people? Day after day, hour after hour, night after night
Logic

Me and my homies just chillin' feelin' the vibes
This the time of our lives but many don't realize
Havin' visions of livin' on another level, never signed to the Devil
The rebel that be fuckin' 'round with the treble
Bumping Tribe in the system like penicillin, motherfucker
I'm killing, spittin' venomous never remember this it's like a system
Say it then I do it, I never missed 'em
Fuck 'em after I kissed 'em, sit back and listen
My chain, it glisten, it's like I'm from another dimension
Did I mention my circle's smaller than an intervention
Then some beautiful women tell me I'm handsome
Then I snatch they heart and make the pussy the ransom
I fuck 'em until inside they belly burst
Stop it, drop the beat and then we cue the verse
Spitting lyrics like how a Mac-11 really disperse
Slaughter MCs and resurrect them when they in the hearse
They say I got too many styles, bitch I've been diverse
They scared to jump in the cipher, I be all up in it first
My apologies but if you're after me then it gets worse
When I come through I spit voodoo and leave 'em cursed

Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program â€” Midnight Marauder
Sounds like some, some '90s shit
Midnight Marauder, It's a good farewell
Midnight Marauder, Uh, I suppose, yeah, music

This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words, the tribe that's next

It's been a long time and I ain't even in my prime
I remember many moons ago spitting the realest lines
On the come up, matter fact it was long before that
Before I bought my first mic, before I could afford that
This is a letter to the underground, the place where I'm from
This is a letter to the fans that understand what I've done
And even though I gotta leave, man, don't none of y'all grieve
'Cause even in the mainstream that lyricism I breathe
Some of y'all love my raw records, some of y'all don't
Some of y'all will love my radio shit, some of y'all won't
Just like my race, my music has always been yin and yang
Something for everybody, no not just one lane
And on the real, I'll never forget the day I got my deal
Full creative control and the money was unreal
Started from the bottom and got here 'cause of my skill
And I never set a goal that I didn't plan to fulfil
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest
Yeah, yeah, this the realest
The realest, say what? Say what?
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words the tribe that's next
This is the realest
This is the realest
