8 ContributorsPlatinum Lyrics
’bout to make the night shine
Snoop
Kellz
Platinum through the doors
V12 rollin’ nigga goin’ platinum
V12 rollin’ nigga goin’ platinum
V12 rollin’ nigga goin’ platinum
V12 rollin’ nigga goin’ platinum

Swag like a lighter
And I keep my swag lit
Man I’m on fire
That can’t tell a nigga shit
V12 rolling
Got some honeys up in it
Say your pussy golden
But I only fuck with platinum chicks
Only talk platinum shit
Only swallow platinum spit
Speak my own slang-uage
Still I am the real-iest
Surrounded by Ciroc but your boy sipping Hennessy
Loves is a hospital and I was born in V.I.P
Sick and there’s no cure
Bad case of V.I.P
Still in the game killing you can call us M.V.P
Whole fucking club jump in your cars and follow me
It’s dude from the Chi and the D.O. double G
You might also like

Platinum stars

Platinum chicks
Platinum
Platinum clothes
Platinum
Platinum rich

Platinum shots
Platinum
Platinum flights
Platinum
Platinum cribs
Platinum
Platinum lights

Let a muthafucker know from the ghetto
Limping, crimping and pimping mixing ‘em all
Fixing the ball drifting listen dawg
My rap is that, my Cadillac is dripping wet
You can bet, turn it up, roll it up, burn it up
Give it back to me let me show you how to move that groove that weed that do that
All in fallin’ ballin’ yellin’ doggy do that chew that
Record sales, ho sales, detail, retail, you fail, we sell
Ding dong get your momma ring your bell
Back in the club with my nephew Kellz
25 girls in the Dogg cartel and they do what the Dogg say grifted or walkway
Pimping on them all day can’t you tell
I’m liking it loving it cubbin’ it gubbin’ it drinks up blunts lit platinum boss shit
Nigga you know how we do this

Take it back in the back of the car
Mack-mack like macking them hard, like that, quote backing them hard
Rich nigga with a platinum card in a platinum car with mink on the seat
Hoes on the street cause they all wanna make that trip to the promised land
Little mama can give it to me like I’m the man
Give it to me like I told you
Grab you, flip you, hold you, break you down
Stop depress, drop your dress, cause I’m gon’ take you down
What d’you think I got drink and you won’t drink right now
Two shots and now you ready for that tat-tat-toawww
And I’m gon’ give you that
I know that you diggin’ that
Platinum smile on your face yeah they know I’m diggin’ that
And i’m liking it, loving it, cubbin’ it, gubbin’ it, drinks up blunts lit platinum
Boss shit
You know how we do this


Look at us mob we at the bar
We going crazy woah
Earth is our turf
We on them jets
Leaving them haters woah
Snoop poppin’ bottles I got models

I see your man he causing problems ’bout to fix it woah
You cats is sloppy

Pimpin’s my hobby
First love mic in hand

And she give me platinum brain

While they going gold
We done went platinum man
