5 ContributorsGucci Speaks (Burrprint 3-D) LyricsAyy, Drum'
(What up, Gucci?)
Straight up, it's a lot of haters out here
(Uh huh)
I heard on the internet that Gucci Mane La Flare, Gucci, me, I wasn't hot
Listen, I owe no one nothing
If I owe you, get it in blood
Take it like the Red Cross 'cause I'm Stevie Wonder this winter
I do not see you fucks
Burr, burr, burr
It's so cold in hereYou might also like1Embed
