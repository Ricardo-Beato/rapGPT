7 ContributorsIâ€™m So Tired of You LyricsBitch
Multiply, divide me Then add on the remainder
I push more weight than a personal trainer
I get my gucci belt, my bag and my hat off the shelf
Im a stylist of a star cause i style myself
And im dancin with the stars, dancin by myself
I was lost so i had to go and find myself
You can take all my welt just leave my health
Cause i can't count all this money think i need some help
It's the franchise of zone 6 no Jazze Jeff
I got drumma boy on the track so dont hold your breathe
Im so icy but my flow will make the soldiers melt
I sewed the game up like my granny sewed a quilt
Gucci
Make a billion dollars what im tryna do
Gucci Mane La Flare im so tired of you
And if i had the time i would be sleepin too
But im workin these streets like a prostitute
They tell me rest up i say i leave the rest for you
Cause right now im chasin check's like a lawyer do
So dont bother me and i won't have to bother you
Im just out here chasin cash like a mobster fool
I got money on my mind like its changin my brain
And in the drought,water spout, gucci brings the rain
Aka the candy the candy cain, ain't proud of the fact i sold everything
And i done did all the drugs, but guess what gucci mane can sell out a club
An next guess ima have a major buzz
I'm so international that i get London love
You might also likeIm no amateur my money stretches way past the perimeter
So hot i broke thermometers, my cash goes 3 kilometer's
In front of you is a conqueror, please dont sit on my furniture
My niggas stand right beside me, but your niggas up unda you
Make a billion dollars what im tryna do
Gucci Mane La Flare im so tired of you
And if i had the time i would be sleepin too
But im workin these streets like a prostitute
They tell me rest up i say i leave the rest for you
Cause right now im chasin check's like a lawyer do
So dont bother me and i won't have to bother you
Im just out here chasin cash like a mobster fool
I know your life's borin, you mad that im tourin
Im in the studio until its 9 in the mornin
And im not even tired, no im not yawning
Im headed to the airport i got a performance
Im hot and your not,but shawty your warmin
So watch out for these haters,ain't not money in warin
Make em hate harder when they stop and you worry
Im the man in the clutch call me gucci mane Horry
Cocaina shawty thats a whole nother story
Cause to a hood bitch gucci's voice is your foray
Mic check ice check another recordin
Invest mission on the avenue's im explorin
Gucci
Make a billion dollars what im tryna do
Gucci Mane La Flare im so tired of you
And if i had the time i would be sleepin too
But im workin these streets like a prostitute
They tell me rest up i say i leave the rest for you
Cause right now im chasin check's like a lawyer do
So dont bother me and i won't have to bother you
Im just out here chasin cash like a monster fool
Make a billion dollars what im tryna do
