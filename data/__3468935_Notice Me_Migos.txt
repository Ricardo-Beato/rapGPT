Good job, First

Got your ho with me
I pull her slowly
Saint Laurent on both my feet
All this jewelry, they gon' notice me
And you know I got that Rol' on me
I pull her slowly
Saint Laurent on both my feet
All this jewelry, they gon' notice me

Ayy, I wanna ride, ride, ride on it
Keep my eyes, eyes, eyes on her
Wanna cry, cry, cry on her
Ayy, I wanna fly, fly, fly on it
Can I vibe, vibe, vibe on it?
Fox Five, Five, Five on it
Get live, yeah

All this jewelry, they gon' notice me (Ayy)
Birds in the traps singin' like Jodeci
I tip a bitch 'cause of my courtesy (Tippin')
Then do a show, pick up my currency (Backend)
Versace slippers colored burgundy ('Sace)
Rappers be talkin', think they hurtin' me (Uh-uh)
I took his ho, make her come work for me (Bitch)
Keep the Draco case an emergency (Grr, grat)
Ridin' 'round the city, sippin' a tea, packin' the heat, niggas that lookin' for me (Lookin' for)
Comin' up watchin' them niggas on TV like they were what I wanted to be (Wanted to)
Now I'm the one, gettin' paid for it, thank God, it's a blessin' to see (Naw, for real)
Doin' shows, I'm on stage for it, Saint Laurent on my feet

I told that bitch to drop a four for me (Drop a four)
Drop my top, now I'm exposin' me (Skrrt, skrrt)
A lot of these rappers gettin' old to me (They kinda old)
Extortion publishin', you owe it to me (You know you owe)
I'm droppin' the top and showin' the titties (Drop top)
Run to the money, we tryna get fitted (Run to the money)
I clear my mind and I had a vision (I had a vision)
And then I arrive with twenty-five bitches (Then they arrive)
We sell out the whole facility
Not likin' your vibe, your energy (Vibe)
I came from the pot with Kimberly (Pot)
She sniffin' the lines, assembly (Lines)
We had a good time in Italy (Time)
Yo, these niggas be lyin' about loyalty (Lyin')
Get on my knees, prayin' to God to cover me
Got your ho with me
