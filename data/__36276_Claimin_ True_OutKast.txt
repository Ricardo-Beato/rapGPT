Yeah, you got it, he-he
Fuck that fuck ass nigga, man, he deserve that shit
Hey, yo, man, ayy, think it's gon' end like that
Man, don't start that sh...
Hey, man, just loc 'em and smoke 'em
Damn
Ayy, man, tryna prove you ain't no punk
Penitentiary full of niggas thought they wasn't punks
Nigga, the fear in yo' eyes, I can feel it
You can't feel shit

Well, it is I, the pimp player nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and player rhymes that I fuck with
And bury amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claimin' true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
Ain't nothin' wrong, you don't belong, you left me standin' alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dippin' and dodgin' bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady tryin' to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit
I studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eatin' watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon

I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me

Our heavenly Father, why do you even bother watchin' over me?
Growin' up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like comin' harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm lettin' the trigger be
'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap or dap from niggas slingin' quarter keys
Just tryna make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be workin' Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shakin' titties just to pay the rent
Lord, tryin' to hustle must be somethin' that was heaven-sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinkin'
I think about Barack, strap myself and keep on dankin'
'Cause I be takin' the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you drainin' like a fountain
Yes, it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me


I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me

What y'all fuck niggas know about that?
OutKast, Goodie Mob, P.A
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me
Yeah, it's K-Axe, here to let y'all know
Ain't shit changed, just a couple more names
Yeah, that's right
Organized Noize, JOI, Big Gipp, Big Rube
Cee-Lo, Goodie Mob, P.A., and the motherfuckin' OutKast
That's right, nigga, we takin' that bullshit no mo' in '94
Shit

I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
(Peace to the Godfather ass, gangsta ass niggas, Antonio Reid)
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me4Embed
