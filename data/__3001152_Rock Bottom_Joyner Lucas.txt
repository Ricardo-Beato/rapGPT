(My nigga MOOSE)
Joyner (Joyner)
Yeah
Ayo ('Cause I never had shit)
This song right here for all the broke motherfuckers (Joyner), the poor motherfuckers
Who ain't never had
Who ain't never had shit

Rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had shit nigga)
Bang, rock bottom
Bang, rock, rock bottom (Nah, never had shit nigga)
Bang, rock bottom
Bang, rock, rock bottom (I never had shit nigga)
Bang, rock bottom
Bang, rock, rock bottom (Cause I never had shit nigga)
Bang, rock bottom
Bang, rock, rock bottom (I never had shit nigga)
Bang, rock bottom
Bang, rock, rock bottom (Nah, I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom

Man I never had shit
I never had cake
Used to sell drugs but I never had weight
Livin' life fast like I never had breaks
Speakers on blast like I never had base
I never had friends, keep my enemies close
Roll the windows up if whenever we smoke
My niggas stay high they can never be low
And I lie to my bitch like I never had hoes
Never wish jail or death on a nigga
I never had tears or respect for a teller
I never did a beer till the cops come and get 'em
Even 27 years couldn't stop Mandela
But I never cooked crack
Never took slack
Run away from home and I never looked back
Broke ass nigga livin' life on the bottom
I was tryna touch a mil and put my mama in a condo
Up in Beverly Hills, maybe down south
Never been a funny nigga why start now
Dreams of a Bentley with a top drop down
Tryna take my shit, then it's po-po-pow
Never been a thug but I'm real acquainted
And you will never feel how real my pain is
And all your new shit sound real outdated
This is real rock bottom for the tears I tasted
Cause I never had shit nigga

Rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (Nah, never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (Cause I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (Nah, I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom

Nah, I ain't never been a rat (rat?)
Nah, I ain't never have no money put the pennies in the bag
Cause I never had a stack (stack?)
Nah, I never been a bitch nigga, never had a pad
You ain't never have a bag (bag?)
You ain't never rode a bus, prolly never took a cab, gettin' ride from your dad
But your momma at work takin' money out her purse tryna pay for some work
Cause you never wasn't nothin' but a spoiled motherfucker
Tryna follow where your friends and magnolia motherfuckers
But you never give respect of a loyal motherfucker
You just want to be down, wanna live fast
Run away from home and don't ever look back
Dreams of a beast livin' life in a city
I'm just tryna touch a mil and put my momma in a mansion
All the way in Miami, maybe in the hill
Never had a job but the nigga got bills
And niggas run they mouth 'till the shit get real
And the thugs come out with the p-p-pill
Never been a thug but I'm real acquainted
You will never feel how real my pain is
And all your new shit sound real outdated
This is real rock bottom for the tears I tasted
Cause I never had shit nigga
Rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (Nah, never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (Cause I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (Nah, I never had shit nigga)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottom (I never had)
Been rock bottom
Been rock, rock bottomEmbed
