27 ContributorsHunchoz Lyrics
Goddamn, bitch
Need a pint, how much you want though?
Shoot his ass up, feeling  (Denis Production)

How much he got? I'm gone though (I'm gone)
Tell that nigga call my phone though (Call my phone)
Come through beating 30s like some congos (Like some congos)
This nigga better hope my gun broke (Hope my gun broke)
I need a pint, how much you want though? (How much you want?)
He better want six hunchos (Want six hunned)
I got pulled over doin' a huncho (Doin' a hunned)
Off a hundred blunts, pockets full of hunchos (Full of hunned)

I'm off the dope, I'm out in public
Walk in the mall like fuck it
I buy everything I wanted
'Cause I remember when I couldn't
Well, now I got them hunchos
Money long, like Rapunzel hair
You think you got them hunchos
Believe me, boy, you don't even wanna go there
Glock .17 so rare
Shoot your ass dead in yo' ear
Come through blowin' shit down, CONAIR
I'm goin' crazy like my auntie's son, yeah (Denis Production)

How much he got? I'm gone though (I'm gone)
Tell that nigga call my phone though (Call my phone)
Come through beating 30s like some congos (Like some congos)
This nigga better hope my gun broke (Hope my gun broke)
I need a pint, how much you want though? (How much you want?)
He better want six hunchos (Want six hunned)
I got pulled over doin' a huncho (Doin' a hunned)
Off a hundred blunts, pockets full of hunchos (Full of hunned)5Embed
