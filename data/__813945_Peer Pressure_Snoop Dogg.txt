She got a Facebook page and a cell phone
Her daddy gettin money
Her momma on the go
She movin too fast
But she really don't know
Life is a trip
But momma don't drink that
They tellin you it cool
But baby don't take that
Cuz if you do, ain't no tellin'
Youse a good girl
Why you fighting and rebellin
If you keep that up, you gonna end up spread
Misled
Better yet sick in the head
So stop trying to be like them and be yourself
Stop! Look, and see yourself
So real, gotta stay hard in the paint

Do wrong, do right, low life, high life
