7 ContributorsWhat U Talkin’ Bout Lyrics
I hate when a motherfucker come talkin' to me about some shit that I ain't tryna hear. Tellin' me how to do my shit.
"You need do this, you need to do that"
What the fuck is you talkin' about?
I been doin' this shit my way since I started this shit.
The way I did this shit got my bank account to where it is.
The way I did this shit got me to where the fuck I'm at.
So I ain't tryna hear none of that shit you talkin' about.
Don't tell me shit.

Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

Let me tell you somethin'
It's everybody's favorite crip cousin, Snoop Dogg
Inductin' these woop hoes as loopholes
Death rowin' them blue drawers, bitch niggas
Good on both sides like switch hitters
Snitches get stitches, send cliques to get niggas
For you to smoke with me cuz, you need 6 figures
Ask your bitch 'bout the dick, yeah, my shit glitter
You might also like
Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (Huh?)
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

'Cause I done changed so many lives with my vibe
Made sure my crips and my wroos all survive
Long Beach throwin' up C's in my stores
Hollywood store, Twin Towers with the boys, nigga
Switchin' bitches like I switch cars
Lil' homies on go, and keep the licks for us
Walkin' in the church, smellin' like a lit forrest
We still good 'cause a real one kept the shit goin'

Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (What?)
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

It don't stop, it don't stop
(Makin' this shit)
We gon let this shit breathe right here, hold up
I done made so much money, everybody gotta love me
But that comes with the game, my nigga, hate it or love it
So what we really talkin' 'bout, if we ain't talkin' 'bout
What I'm talkin' 'bout
'Cause what I'm talkin' 'bout got niggas hella bags
Sophisticated crippin' with the ghetto swag
Three-piece suit with a black and a yellow rag, tied in a knot
Rollin' down the Laundro got my eyes on the opps
Got my eyes on the cops, got my eyes on the block
Fresh off stage, rich or broke loco, shit don't change
Where I'm from (Long Beach)

Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (What?)
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?
If it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?

Fuck outta my face with that shit, man
(Makin' this shit)
It's what we do
Right on, right on
(Makin' this shit)Embed
