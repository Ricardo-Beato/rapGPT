3 ContributorsStrictly Fo’ My Niggaz (Original) Lyrics
Yo, law
Is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
Yeah, Mr. Fuck-a-Cop is back
And I still don't give a fuck, yaknahmsayin'?
Puffin' on this indo (Guess who's back)
In the studio with my partners out here (Guess who's back)
Pacific Heights in the house (Guess who's back), know what I mean?
(And madder than motherfucker)

I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
'Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send 'em upstate 'cause they straight-up hate the niggas
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggas
Straight fools into rules and do niggas
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen', punk, picture that
I stay strapped, motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein' me, I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
And ever since the movies these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And, aw yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the ear with my phone or my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggas tryin' to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop
Now drop it

Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's

Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
"You're just another rapper, who swears he's makin' records"
That's what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though, always kept my head up high
Eventually I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night always comes a brighter day
And some would say, that turned away is all you'll get
I just said "Bet!," and never let 'em see me sweat
'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell
Yo, get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hit the studio, 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it 'til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you, and that way you can never fall
But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car note
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
Remember how it felt and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's

This is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stick-ups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not, 2Pac will cop the Glock and come knockin' to getcha
I told you once, motherfucker, I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
Niggas know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore, nigga
It's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin' all that shit
Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggas that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin' trigger
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga
Mr. Troublesome, niggas tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator, nigga, I'll be back
Yeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me, ring the alarm, G
'Cause most motherfuckers love to act up, without they backup
When they get jacked up, they crack up
It's strictly for my niggas at the show
So they know, not to play me like a ho
Strictly for my
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's

Strictly for my, strictly for my, stric-stric-
Strictly for my, strictly for my, stric-stric-
Strictly for my, strictly for my, stric-stric-
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's
Strictly, strictly, stric-stric-
Strictly, strictly, stric-stric-
Strictly, strictly, stric-stric-
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's

Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
