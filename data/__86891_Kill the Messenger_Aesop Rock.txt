20 ContributorsKill the Messenger Lyrics
Hey stupid, you're listening to Bazooka tooth, dental cannons, molar pistols; shit like that
This is Murs, motherfucker, this is Aesop Rock, Ace Rizzle. Ya know what I'm saying? Check it out, like, Living Legends, Def Jux, if you don't know, now you're informed
Be better prepared for the next time this type of shit goes down. Cause when it's happening and you're unaware you look like a complete asshole
(Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums)

Every leader dead and it's making you upset
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom
Set, set, set...
Every hero dead and it's making you forget
Get, get, get
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom

I'm in and out a pig channel serrated for hand feeders
Army of vicious kitchen patrol yam peelers
They sleep in barns and whisper loony conspiracy secrets
Increasing payroll awareness blind while a.w.o.l. went the leaders
The only mammal officially banned from food chain comp
For finishing for over 25 consecutive years on top is aggravated
Alarmingly, the pulse don't bump right
And he's up nights
Bumping over crunk and bug bites
Who luck like this evening?
Stay electric mud blood jockeying for the footing
My last supper starts with a vinaigrette over pickled Muppet hearts while sheep tuck deep in the wood chipper
For the shepherd was a milk carton and scissors
Clammy hands make henna run on risky jenga tugs: you're all sweating, Hell I'm sweatin' too, just ain't nobody sweatin' you!
(Holmes!)
The muck went abacus on labor perspirator official biz
When auditioning demos by which to live
No whammies, Stop
Your triple six game never chose me
Trickery gets hokey
Pick up sticks and ponies
You've got mail, champ: blow me
Just trooper with a question mark machine needy
Pointed at the heavens like a Bee Gee on some where the hell's my freebee?
To clamp war stupid
No landlords or super
No hands
Water no ice cubes Rubik, no plans
No motor movement, no dance, no pyrotechnics to enhance
No chance
Too many grown men call in sick over cramps
I weigh in heavy on the jaded bitter subtracting the frontal gimmick
I want to solve world hunger and fuck a pin-up
I want to find a 21st century carbon crutch worthy of pedestal placement and shitty path walking to touch

Every leader dead and it's making you upset
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom
Set, set, set...
(drums drums drums drums
Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums)
Every hero dead and it's making you forget
Get, get, get
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom
(drums drums drums drums drums)

Ain't no time to sit and lift stones
So it's left to the dogs to find their way home
And you grew up in a similar generation alone
With a fist full of humanoid models along the road
But a blank and you're ancient
Fuck if I can find a flesh and bone tour guide to edge me through the makeshift
Every little footprint’s faded and vacant
Now I stomp through this motherfucker impatient
For the first time in a long line of dog fights
Little Lassie will not be returning home tonight
They’re saying someone everclear spiked the punchbowl of Christ but all I saw was six pits ripping throat box out her life
Live lizard lung out a this ain’t Kansas cause
Where the lemmings run with scissors to the closest open jaws
Pause
Open the fucking door Hal, it’s your valid mistake
I will not bow to a god that I can’t look in the face
It go C-4 tongue and a janky ankle
He still escort an Eeyore to the seafloor, thank you
Please curb your Egor
Alto spas Alcatraz to the peace core
Anti bleep. Anti sheep
Sword anti sheathed for corroded shoulders to lean toward
Short ‘em, sort of report consecutive awkward moments like Gandhi and Hitler stuck in elevators broken
One could reach the ceiling panel boosted by the other, but suddenly suffocating doesn’t seem all that stubborn
Is you with it? It’s brick Timb on eggshell percentages
Only mobile at but a trotter’s clip
No dial tone or walking stick. Fostered chickies peel back a placenta with broke posture for the daily dun da da’s done didn’t glow proper
From the promised land abortion of keepers and bleeding orphans
Where only the megas creep outside the box to seize the fortress
I and my crew seek an informal enforcement passage after receiving a timeline laced with tutor muter packages. Come on baby, act with us. The other activists, refusing to pour dummy accusations to the aqueducts
These are the days when the flotsam and the jetsam part ways trying to convince the players to fuck the game
But we don’t want to trouble you
We take no for an answer
If and only if enhanced with 'k' and 'w'
We’re only warning kitten paws who want escorting through the jungle zoo
This little industry will buckle you
(Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums)

Every leader dead and it's making you upset
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom
Set, set, set...
(drums drums drums drums
Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums)
Every hero dead and it's making you forget
Get, get, get
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom
(drums drums drums drums drums)

You know Aes Rock
You know you've been waiting like, how long?
You got flow, you're saying he was better back then
I've heard this shit it's killing anything he's ever done
So shut the fuck up, love it like you know you want to
Just don't be a little bitch
Little bitches get sniped in their mouth
And that's how it happens every time
You keep listening because maybe you'll learn something, yeah
By the way Can Ox is not broken up, it's just a rumorEmbed
