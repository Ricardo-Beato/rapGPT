31 ContributorsA Dedication Lyrics
This just my interpretation of the situation

And this is my dedication
What's poppin’ dedication 4 ho (D4)
And this is dedicated, first off
To my city
The lost city of New Orleans
But umm, I wanna speak to my city
And I wanna let ‘em know that
We can’t be lost for long
And we damn sure can’t be lost forever
So it's time we find ourselves
Within all that water
Within all that dirt, within all that blood, within all that pain, within all them cries
It’s time to find ourselves, New Orleans
Because memories are everything
And when I say memories are everything
I mean it’s important what you are remembered by
And trust me. I, you, we
Don’t wanna be remembered as the lost city
I’d rather be remembered of the city that found glory after all that tragedy
Strength, yea
Also I built that skate park down there and get them kids off the streets
You’re welcome
But umm, we gotta get up man
Fuck it
Rise above it
