Nigga, you need to get up, get out and get something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need get up, get out and get something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out and get something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
I don't recall, ever graduatin' at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found
Always askin' "Gimme some," livin' life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit (What?), I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon' do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me, though
(Why not?) Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I
Get high but I don't get too high (Why?)
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get yo' ass up out the bed before three
You need to get up, get out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of havin' to do it all?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know somethin' I don't, do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeanin'
Sick of takin' trash out and toilet bowl cleanin'
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin'
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smugglin'
Nah, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue travelin' his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
You need to get up, get out and get something

Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead?
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fuckin' Pro Keds
My mama made me do it but the Devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fuckin' Starters (Yeah, ha-ha-ha)
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call 'em my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see, I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money so I never whipped 'em (What's up, hoe?)
See all the players came and all the players went
A player ain't a gangsta but a player can handle his shit, bitch
You need to get up, get out, get something
Smoke out 'cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah, I said it, a nigga sportin' plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized 'cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool, yeah, it's real cool gettin' paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha!
You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
You need to get up, get out and get something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out and get something (Get something)
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm gettin' paranoid and steady lookin' for the time
It's eight in the mornin' and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm diggin' through the ashtray, hopin' to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to get up, get out and get something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncin'
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killer that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumpin' out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm bustin' out around the corner in my hog
Dippin' from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead, 'cause I have no time for jail
Fuck Clampett cops, fuck Eldrin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinkin' that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo'
OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo! (Hootie Hoo!)
My White Owls are burnin' kind of slow
You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
You need to get up, get out and get something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out and get something (Get something)
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

Y'all tellin' me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody black runnin' but crac-kers, so, why
I got to register? I thinkin' of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take y'all way
Back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ayy
Y'all could not tell me nothin', thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start workin' at that loadin' dock
They layin' my mama off of work, General Motors trippin'
But I come home banked like Hank, from lickin' and dippin'
Doin' dumb shit, not knowin' what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point still actin' a fool
Wastin' my time in the school, I'd rather be shootin' pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about mackin' hoes and wearin' pimp fade
Instead of bein' in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not thinkin' about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up, I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talkin' yang yang so I payed her no attention
And kept missin' the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feelin' broke as shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast
So get up off your ass

You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out and get something (Get something)
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need to get up, get out and get something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out and get something (Get something)
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
