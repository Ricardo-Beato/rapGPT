Actavis ‘cause we don’t drink that wise shit
They talking about the Migos we spreading like we a virus
Thinking about running up on me, think I’m sweet, I wouldn’t advise it
Diamonds build our temperature up, fucking run it to the closet
Chopper make you do whatever I say niggas call me Simon
Money growing like Pinocchio, nigga, but I ain’t lying
Most of these bitches ain’t mine, I fuck them then move down the line
See that cocaina gon’ bring you to crime
And that cocaina gon’ start bringing the fire
But get caught with that cocaina get time
You been fucking up and run at the wrong time
It can be a crumb they gon’ charge you like it’s a dime
Looking at my neck and wrist like why I can’t shine
Looking at the i8 like why can’t I ride?
Cocaina come out the boat and it’s certified

Yee!
