6 ContributorsHood Rich Lyrics
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch

Neman Marcus shopping
Prada shoe walking
Diamonds in my chain got my chest moonwalking
Michael Jackson bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I'm booming off the chain and I'm moving bricks
Black and white diamond got my wrist doing flips
Pissy yellow diamond blow your main girl a kiss
Pull up in a Maserati looking like a pimp
With the OJ piece cost twenty 
Eating calamari pasta, heavy on the shrimp
Calamari pasta, heavy on the shrimp
Shawty say it's 
Lookin' real ridiculous
Green stones are pickely
Send these bitches to 
Literally and figuratively, hottest in the industry
When they get a load of me, pack boy sacking groceries
Crazy color carrots got your baby momma mad at me
It would be a tragedy if she would join the faculty
You might also like
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch

I got twenty on my neck
Fifty on my finger
I'm a million dollar nigga so I'm changing my demeanor
I got stacks of this shit
I did it cause I want to
I got bales of this shit
I did it cause I grind foo'
Catch me flexing on a bitch
Riding clean in the old school
Money out the ass so you know that I'm a young fool
Why you talk like that?
Cause I'm a cocaine  so I can flex like that
Fifteen on my neck
Seven five on my wrist
What you know bout Mr.  with this scale bitch
My trap on fire
My trap doin' numbers
The diamonds in my watch look like cucumbers
In the trap them bricks going for a cool 
Stealing bases like Sammy Sosa playing for the Cubs
I be hustling, I be working, I be trapping like a bitch
I guess that's why my swag so arrogant
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch

See I'm a shiner, I'm a grinder, I be all of the above
And if you want it I can get it cause I be plugged with them drugs
I might be low but ain't not joke I keep the pistol by my side
It ain't no license  just the way I'm gon' ride
My money keep talking
I tell these niggas keep walking
In the trap I be postin' but in the club I be ballin'
My pockets is low
My niggas know what it is
I ain't coming to the trap until I catch me a lick
Stupid fruity swag
That's L.A. up on that shit
I be booming, I be bunking, yeah I stay up on that shit
God damn I'm getting money
Man I'm trapping like a fool
In the  posted up  without my tool
Two for five where I be
Niggas shine where I be
Zaytoven you a fool, damn you riding on that beat
Nigga know where I be, posted 
You can drive thru my trap nigga call my shit McDonalds
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitchEmbed
