29 ContributorsTraffic in the Sky Lyrics
Recently it seem like everywhere we go
The drinks stay cold when we coolin', coolin'
And being broke starts to get a little old
My money had to get some fine tunin'
Tonight might be the night I make it
So let's live it up and don't regret it at all (No)
All these faces, different places
People hit me up but I'm forgettin' to call (Haha)
Get away to California when the weather gettin' colder
My honeys by the pool and umbrellas in mimosas
Chillin' at the beach house, loungin' on the sofa
Ridin' with a chauffeur, on my way to blow up, stoner
Roll up, fishin', champagne sippin'
Five-star chef stay cookin' in the kitchen (Haha)
But makin' only the good shit (What?)
See the way I'm living, they like "Oh my goodness"

I tell 'em I'm fine (Hey, hey)
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind (Hey, hey)
And, baby, all we got is time (Hey, hey)
Let's just watch the clouds go by (Heh)
Ah, ah, ah, ah

And there ain't a need to panic
Girl, we can lay up on this hammock
No need to pose here, everything candid
Livin' in the moment, feelin' so splendid
Bottles on me, you can put it on the debit (Uh-huh)
I'm just tryna have fun tonight
So everybody wang chung tonight (Haha)
Girl, you can fall in love tonight
'Cause trust me, I'ma fuck you right
Got my Louis shades on, ain't a damn thing wrong (Nah)
Fillin' up cups 'til the bottle all gone
We just coolin', coolin' (What?,) feel the breeze
Decided to give you something you could sing off-key, like
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la) Uh, I be puffin' that
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
(La, la-la, la-la, la-la) Hehe,  yeah

And, baby, all we got is time (Hey)
Let's just watch the clouds go by
Ah, ah, ah, ah
