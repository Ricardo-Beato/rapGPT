5 ContributorsWaves Lyrics
Why you show me love like that?
Show me love babe, show me love babe
Why you kissin' up like that?
Kissin' up babe, kissin' up babe

You got a body that girls would die for, a smile the sun shines for
The type I might wife, call you my ride or die, go Bonnie and Clyde for
I didn't know you could love like that, move your hips like that
You know, you know, that turns me on

Let me dive down to your ocean floor
Touch you from head to toe
Baby, ride that wave, no surfboard
Don't stop, no, no, give me more
Let me dive down to your ocean floor
Touch you from head to toe
Baby, ride that wave no surfboard
Don't stop, no, no, give me more and more

Baby can we run it back
Run it back babe, run it back babe
Ooh, don't you run it like that
Run like that, run like that
You might also like
You got a body that girls would die for, a smile the sun shines for
The type I might wife, call you my ride or die, go Bonnie and Clyde for
I didn't know you could love like that, move your hips like that
You know, you know, that turns me on

Let me dive down to your ocean floor
Touch you from head to toe
Baby, ride that wave no surfboard
Don't stop, no, no, give me more
Let me dive down to your ocean floor
Touch you from head to toe
Baby, ride that wave no surfboard
Don't stop, no, no, give me more and more

Want them girl a sexy, I want to be close to you immensely
Come in my bedroom, undress me, now rub me down girl, caress me
Radio play in Paris, overlookin' the terrace
Baby blushin', she so embarrased
Got her a ring full of karats
Baguettes, pearls, and diamonds too
Treat ya right, that's what a wise man do
A bird's eye view, wit' a art from the Louvre
Kissin' on my body, sparks at the moon
Barks at the moon, like a thief in the night
Step to my left, so we keepin' it right
Keepin' it tight, livin' the life
Lovin' the night, huggin' ya tight
Ya need a Crip cuz in ya life
And that's me, ooh-wee, OG Snoopy
Let's take a walk in the sand, baby, gimme yo' hand
Let me dive down to your ocean floor
Touch you from head to toe
Baby, ride that wave no surfboard
Don't stop, no, no, give me more and more
Let me dive down to your ocean floor
Touch you from head to toe
Baby, ride that wave no surfboard
Don't stop, no, no, give me more and more
Let me dive down to your ocean floor
Touch you from head to toe
Baby, ride that wave no surfboard
Don't stop, no, no, give me more and more
Let me dive down to your ocean floor
Touch you from head to toe
Baby, ride that wave no surfboard
Don't stop, no, no, give me more and moreEmbed
