Grrah (Grrah, grrah, grrah)
Grrah (Grrah)
Grrah, she a baddie, she showin' her panty (Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT)

She a baddie, she showin' her panty (She showin' her panty)
She shake it like jelly (She shake it like jelly, damn, damn)
Hundred bands in Chanely (Hundred bands in Chanely)
But I'm still shakin' ass in a deli (But I'm still shakin' ass, grrah, grrah)
With my bitch gettin' deady (With my bitch gettin' deady)
He like him a wetty (He like him a wetty)
He want the WAP, but I just want the fetty (Grrah, grrah)
And I'm baggin' his partner, I'm petty (Grrah, grrah)

Call me that bee while hе eatin' my honey (Eatin' my honey, damn)
You know niggas lovе bitches with money (Bitches with money)
I get a lot (I get a lot)
Takin' her spot (Grrah)
If you ain't cookin', then get off the pot
My name Ice, but I always stay hot
Passenger princess, he pass me his knock (Grrah)
Baddest lil' bitch from my block
Me and baddies be gettin' along
So they always be singin' my song
Steppin' outside, I'ma put that shit on (Like, like)
Three hundred and then I perform (Damn)
You know I'ma get to the bag
All the hatin' bitches to the back (To the back)
Too much to lose, so I cannot react (Damn)
Damn, bitches be goin' out sad (Grrah)

She a baddie, she showin' her panty (She showin' her panty)
She shake it like jelly (She shake it like jelly, damn, damn)
Hundred bands in Chanely (Hundred bands in Chanely)
But I'm still shakin' ass in a deli (Grrah)
With my bitch gettin' deady (With my bitch gettin' deady)
He like him a wetty (He like him a wetty)
He want the WAP, but I just want the fetty (Grrah)
And I'm baggin' his partner, I'm petty (Grrah)

Feelin' a smooch, and I'm showin' my coochie
PJ to Emilio Pucci (Damn, damn)
I love white bitches like shoutout to Lucy
If she bad, then I let her seduce me (Damn, damn)
I'm the shit, I'm that bitch, I'm Miss Poopie
Juice in my cup got me feelin' real loopy (Got me feelin' real loopy)
Forty-inch, middle-parted (Forty-inch, middle-parted)
He got all my pics hearted (Grrah, grrah)
They all like, "Damn, Ice, your flow be the hardest" (Like)
I'm not a regular artist, grrah, grrah
Go 'Ku and I'm just gettin' started
Baddies on baddies, they know how to move
'Ooters on 'ooters, they know how to 'oot
Bussin' that pack, goin' straight to the moon (Goin' straight to the moon)
Off the juice, actin' loose
She a baddie, she showin' her panty (She showin' her panty)
She shake it like jelly (She shake it like jelly, damn, damn)
Hundred bands in Chanely (Hundred bands in Chanely)
But I'm still shakin' ass in a deli (Grrah, grrah)
With my bitch gettin' deady (With my bitch gettin' deady)
He like him a wetty (He like him a wetty)
He want the WAP, but I just want the fetty (Damn, grrah)
And I'm baggin' his partner, I'm petty (Grrah)

And I'm baggin' his partner, I'm petty
But I'm still shakin' ass in a deli
Grrah (Grrah, grrah)6Embed
