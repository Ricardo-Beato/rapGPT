7 ContributorsReputation Lyrics
Niggas know Gucci for hustlin', I ain't scared of nothin'
You know lil' shawty from Custer, he's a shiesty mothafucka
Man I know the nigga's reputation
These niggas know I got a reputation
These niggas known for bein' petty, raggidy ass Chevy
Broke ass nigga with a mouth full of Eddie's
Man I know that nigga's reputation
That nigga broke, he got a reputation

Mouth on shine, wrists on shine
Reputation for makin' a bitch go blind
I need all mine, don't short me nare dime
Don't give a damn you wholesale, I'm gram for gram mine
I'm settin' the trap down, I'm beatin' the block down
I get your ho i traffic, I bet she jump down
I bet she can't resist it, I bet she won't miss it
She seem the Forgiattos, that bitch is blowin' kisses
It's Uncle Sam time, don't short me nare dime
If you owe me, nigga I want it, I'm comin' and gettin' mine
I shoot a chopper and a handgun at the same damn time
Got a reputation for takin', bitch I want mine

Niggas know Gucci for hustlin', I ain't scared of nothin'
You know lil' shawty from Custer, he's a shiesty mothafucka
Man I know the nigga's reputation
These niggas know I got a reputation
These niggas known for bein' petty, raggidy ass Chevy
Broke ass nigga with a mouth full of Eddie's
Man I know that nigga's reputation
That nigga broke, he got a reputation
You might also like
Nigga know me for gettin' paid, I'm stupid paid
Nigga no you for gettin' sprayed, get a band-aid
Niggas know me for takin' money, nigga I'm a taker
Niggas know you for gettin' played, I'm the player
Niggas know me for gettin' hundreds, bustin' condoms
East Atlanta good run like I'm James Bond's son
Stackin' up the grands like your mothafuckin' grandson
Steppin' on the dope like your mothafuckin' stepson
Tryna fuck a rich bitch, light scare, man
Ridin' in a UFO, like a Jetson
Smokin' on that gas pack, I got the eggs, son
Ballin' like an athlete, I'm not a Piston

Niggas know Gucci for hustlin', I ain't scared of nothin'
You know lil' shawty from Custer, he's a shiesty mothafucka
Man I know the nigga's reputation
These niggas know I got a reputation
These niggas known for bein' petty, raggidy ass Chevy
Broke ass nigga with a mouth full of Eddie's
Man I know that nigga's reputation
That nigga broke, he got a reputation

Finesse king, that's my reputation
Take your ass out, with no hesitation
I'll sell you anything, like my nigga Radrick
I'm talkin' 'bout Gucci Mane, you know Mr. Davis
Million dollars worth of diamonds in my mama's basement
I get a book and wet it up and then I duct-tape it
Young Scooter in the rap game, he's still taken
Got an '86 Cutlass and you want 4 bricks?
Your car ain't worth a split, nigga you just a lick
Your reputation on the street, nigga you just a snitch
And I'm a real street nigga, you must not forget
My reputation: In the drought, I got all the bricks
Niggas know Gucci for hustlin', I ain't scared of nothin'
You know lil' shawty from Custer, he's a shiesty mothafucka
Man I know the nigga's reputation
These niggas know I got a reputation
These niggas known for bein' petty, raggidy ass Chevy
Broke ass nigga with a mouth full of Eddie's
Man I know that nigga's reputation
That nigga broke, he got a reputationEmbed
