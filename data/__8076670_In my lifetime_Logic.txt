Check (Yow)
Yeah, yeah
Actually, that was pretty dope there (Ayo)
Can't even lie

Ayo, I got game, plenty
Talk shit, reload the semi
Mafia shit with Juicy J, sippin' Henny
I got Mastro money, boy, your pockets on Denny's
I hit the beat machine, get cream for the whole team
Supply the fiends, dollar bills by any means
Average person be committed if they've seen the shit I've seen
It's like my life was written through a murdеr scene
Even in my еarly teens
I saw a guy on the corner gettin' high
When a stray bullet from a drive-by blew his brains through his right eye
Some people cautious, but I'm Cassius (Yes)
Motherfuck who rhyme the fastest (Woo)
I made it through the light despite how dark my past is, what?

Hip-hop baby, party rockin', you know what it is
Shit hard
Dark
Haha, you should be concerned
Yeah, yeah, motherfucker, you know it's me
You should
You might also like
Smoking back-to-back Dutches
My finger just inches off the button that'll turn your fuckin' body into stuffing
Dressed like I'm doing construction
Off one leg, jump through the fuckin' window of the Hellcat like it's nothing now
At that speed, I could easily be mistaken for Jet Li
Don't interrupt my feng shui
Get left in the fridge where they hang meat
My bitch'll kick you with strange feet
A thousand roses expertly engraved into the handle of the heat
Carved ice and pre-Colombian queens
Jackson Heights, rock Columbia, boo
GUESS jeans, smoked drugs on mezzanine
Way before a motherfucker ever turned seventeen
I'll leave you in the Heaven scene
Staring at the roof of the chapel, I showed you mercy
You could've been in soup or a taco
My Porsche colder than a bowl of gazpacho
Commemorate me with a statue
"Fuck the world" written on the tattoo
Man, I be smoking mad shit, that's why I'm silly (Stupid)
Motherfucker, you know it's me1Embed
