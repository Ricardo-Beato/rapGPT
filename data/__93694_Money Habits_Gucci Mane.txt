23 ContributorsMoney Habits Lyrics
I can't get no sleep I've got these money habits
Every time I see some money, you know I've gotta grab it
Dopeboy I do magic with saran wrapper
Done seen more bricks than a contractor
And you can't bring it back if you done bust a wrapper
My daughter 4 months, bricks in her pamper
I'm a road master, I love Tampa
You say you from the streets, then I gotta stamp ya
Grant, Jackson, Ben Franklin
If money through with you then you ain't gonna make it
The streets will give it to you and the streets will take it
Every nigga in the streets got no patience

I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money, yeah, I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreaming seeing money, talking Ben Franklins
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money yeah I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreamer seeing money, talking Ben Franklins

I go loco 'bout that guapo, off El Chapo with the choppa
Like a rasta I will've shot ya, blocka blocka Waka Flocka!
I got young niggas in the hood that'll kill your ass for 50 dollars
Holla red rock if you scared, nigga I ain't never hollered
Don't be bothered I strapped the C4 right to you father
Pipe Bomb taped to a toddler
No I'm not an infant but I got a bunch of baby bottles
For instance, I back doored a nigga in The Ramada
The distance from Florida to Georgia is farther
My amigos is still sending bales across the border
Off the boat bitch I swear she look like she came out the water
It's BrickSquad 1017 and ain't no niggas harder!

Every time I see some money, yeah, I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreaming seeing money, talking Ben Franklins
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money yeah I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreamer seeing money, talking Ben FranklinsEmbed
