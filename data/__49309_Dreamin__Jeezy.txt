23 ContributorsDreaminâ€™ Lyrics
This one for the hood right here
Song dedicated for anybody out there got some dreams
Dont give up on your dreams real talk
You ready Keysha lets go

Dreamin.....Dreamin......Dreamin......
Dreamin.....Dreamin......Dreamin......

Born september 28 my life far from great
No food on the table so we fought for steak
But I'm so close to jail feels like I'm so close to hell
Moms smoking rocks same stuff im sellin
So who's wrong her or me
She addicted to the high im addicted to the cash
Almost put my hands on her when I caught her in my stash
How could I do her like that lord knows im wrong
Why would I do her like that lord know she strong
I know its been hard but we made it baby
10 years clean so she still my lady I must be dreamin

Dreamin' (always think about it) (I must be) (man I must be)
Dreamin' (always think about it) Dreamin' (ooooo rite)
Dreamin' (always think about it) (must be) man I must be
Dreamin' (always think about it) Dreamin' (oooo yea)

One thing about it I got love for you homie
Two things about it I take a slug for you homie
Look at you now you's a business man
Im proud of you dog handle ya buisness man
You like the brother I never ever had
You try your best and I still get mad
We risk's it all together been thru it all together
Caught cases and we still together
Headed OT I sleep while you drivin
Me and my dog yeah we chipping on 5's
Remember back when we shared our clothes
Look at us now we sell out shows I must be dreamin

Dreamin' (always think about it) (I must be) (man I must be)
Dreamin' (always think about it) Dreamin' (ooooo rite)
Dreamin' (always think about it) (must be) man I must be
Dreamin' (always think about it) Dreamin' (oooo yea)

I was young and dumb with a pocket full of cash
Posted on the block with a pocket full of glass
Full speed still running from my past
But its starting to catch up yeah its gaining on my ass
Theres 2 types of people predator n prey
I'm a predator I prey 3 times a day
A man once said one day you'll have kids
And how you goin to explain all that shit you did
I'm a soul survivor we far from a crook
She always said I was a lot smarter then I looked
So I took my dreams and made it some thousands
Then I took my life and I made it an album I must be dreamin'
Dreamin' (always think about it) (I must be) (man I must be)
Dreamin' (always think about it) Dreamin' (ooooo rite)
Dreamin' (always think about it) (must be) man I must be
Dreamin' (always think about it) Dreamin' (oooo yea)1Embed
