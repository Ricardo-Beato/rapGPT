12 ContributorsThree Zero Zero Lyrics
Ayy, ayy

Put ya sets up, put ya gats up, ayy
Bitch, I got now fuck who next up, ayy
Walk up in the store with my check up, ayy
Walk up in that office, where my check at?
Or I’m a blow this bitch, on my exploding shit
They like "You the man, Sosa", but I know this shit
They like "Please calm down, Sosa", but I won’t for shit
Blow my gun at anyone on my 300 shit

Rambo, Rambo, we comin' through like Rambo
Gun tote a hundred ammo, 300 animal
But don’t make me call them Spartans have 300 at ya door
They don't got no fuckin' swords ,bitch, they got choppers at ya throat, ayy
I got my locksmith at ya door, ayy
Ayy, He pick ya lock, we in to smoke, ayy
Ayy, bitch, no talking, bitch, no bossin'
Ayy, then we out like vamanos, ayy
Her mouth on my D, I’m like "No teeth", ayy
She gave me the knee-knee and I went weak, ayy
Bitch, no Twitter beef, go call police, ayy
300 shit, my pistol with me and I am gon' squeeze, ayy

Put ya sets up, put ya gats up, ayy
Bitch, I got now fuck who next up, ayy
Walk up in the store with my check up, ayy
Walk up in that office, where my check at?
Or I’m a blow this bitch, on my exploding shit
They like "You the man, Sosa", but I know this shit
They like "Please calm down, Sosa", but I won’t for shit
Blow my gun at anyone on my 300 shit

300, 300, bitch, I’m still 300
I still rep BD don’t I? I still got my heat don’t I?
Keep runnin', keep runnin' and I’m a keep blowin'
I’ma catch a motherfucker every night and every morning
Bang, bang, ayy
She seen my ice, she think it’s snowin', ayy
You try to take my ice, bitch, thank the morning
Is you gon' wake up to thank the lord, ayy?
Glo up like wake up you can’t avoid, ayy
If you don’t smell the coffee, we come through chalkin', ayy
Have this pistol on me, come through sparkin', ayy
I have my dogs with me, come through barkin', ayy
You ain’t have no fucking business talking, ayy
Ayy, boy, yo dogs some yorkies, ayy
Shitzu, boy, yo dogs some puppies
My dogs pit bulls, they talk with Glocks and forties
The cops grab me ain’t talkin' without my lawyer, ayy
I’m still coolin' with my youngins
You keep it 100, bitch, I keep it 300, ayy
Ayy, I’m boolin' with my youngins, ayy
