I guess you thought a nigga 'bout to pay for it?
Naw little bitch, this ain't even that type of party
Oh you thought a nigga was a sweet lick, huh?
No nigga, this ain't even that type of party
You fucked up tryin' pass me the mid little nigga
Naw this ain't even that type of party
I'mma tell you like it is, give a fuck what you thought, nigga
This ain't even that type of party (x 3)
This ain't even that type of party little bitch
This ain't even that type of party (x3)
This ain't even that type of party my nigga
This ain't even that type of party

This ain't even type of party, jugging with the carter
Surveillance on my trap, it's full of gangsters, full of robbers
Chalupas in the water
Hit em with the egg beater, get the trap started
Longway be touching down with the pack in Illinois
Double parking in valet,  double up
Trap out the real, that bitch give that ho a buck
Bitch think she caught a man cause she seen the Chopard
She fishing my ankle, little bitty bitch I'm a star
I get in the kitchen, go to whipping the water
Trigger finger get to itching when they talk about robbing
Yellow tape, first 48, chilling
Young thug motivating lil nigga
Trapping in the trenches with the snow lil nigga
It ain't the type of party but I came with 2 bitches
Longway Heffner while, Migos came with the pimpin
Balenciaga stepping, I be dripping with the Crip

Naw little bitch, this ain't even that type of party
Oh you thought a nigga was a sweet lick, huh?

This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party my nigga
This ain't even that type of party

This ain't even that type of party
You know I'm a sergeant, I keep me a carter
Don't get it twisted because a nigga is a artist
I be coming through your window like I'm Roger
I started off trapping and I was posted at the park
Nigga run off with the work and now we swimming with the sharks
.44 bulldog, bet that bitch bark
I was raised in the jungle, it's a lion in my heart
What these niggas thinking, my diamonds got niggas blinking
Bitches at that the condo, they fucking, they suck my semen
If you don't know how to cook it I can give you the ingredients
When I got a show they jumping up and down like EDM
They say we ain't gon' spray, I say my niggas gon' graffiti him
My niggas hungry, put them on a plate, I bet they eating them
No piano but you know we got the keys
Nigga tried to sell a nigga mid, nigga please!
I guess you thought a nigga 'bout to pay for it?
Naw little bitch, this ain't even that type of party
Oh you thought a nigga was a sweet lick, huh?
No nigga, this ain't even that type of party
You fucked up tryin' pass me the mid little nigga
Naw this ain't even that type of party
I'mma tell you like it is, give a fuck what you thought, nigga
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party little bitch
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party my nigga
This ain't even that type of party

You looking at the Rolex wearing
F&H carrying and I can't forget the Rolls Royce driving
I said ya know how it goes, but a pack touchdown
Get the work in that phone like Verizon
Throw a block party nigga yeah nigga wanna split
Nigga right down the middle like a kitkat
I'm on 285 right never getting rental
And I'm riding 'round this bitch with a six pack
Any nigga ride with me, give a fuck bout Giuseppe's
They run up on ya Cortes
See mothafuckas don't know shit about snow
I'll run up on ya in some Hermes
I said blow-white Aventador, automatic start
Swear the shit jumping out the bowl my nigga
Had to call it in back then my nigga
When they split they were going for the ten my nigga
Been playing in the mothafucking water all day
I'm surprised ain't grow me a fin my nigga
What you know about an all white 
Break the whole thang down, take a 250 of it
Then you have the rest of it like it's Easter
I guess you thought a nigga 'bout to pay for it?
Naw little bitch, this ain't even that type of party
Oh you thought a nigga was a sweet lick, huh?
No nigga, this ain't even that type of party
You fucked up tryin' pass me the mid little nigga
Naw this ain't even that type of party
I'mma tell you like it is, give a fuck what you thought, nigga
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party little bitch
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party
This ain't even that type of party my nigga
This ain't even that type of party1Embed
