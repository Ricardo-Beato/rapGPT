16 ContributorsFrom the D to the A 2 Lyrics
Oh shit, I just hit a boss bitch (No cap)
Play soft with her, just to give her hard dick (I love you)
Real dog, when I walk, you could see the paw prints (Grr)
Heard a nigga beat her ass, don't be hittin' our bitch, nigga (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
D to the A, Tree from the Bay (From the Bay)
Got a freak in L.A., flew her to me today (Flew Delta)
Me and Boat still locked in, ain't shit changed (My brother)
Pint talk, nigga, we got more sixteens than a tenth grade (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)

I'm a bitch breaker, move like The Undertaker (Yeah)
Grippin' on my blick in the crib in thе elevator
Move with thе amputator, rap niggas animators (Yeah)
Talkin' like they hard on the 'net, they just commentators (Cap)
My niggas is confiscators (Yeah), take your lil' chain, pawn
I'm in that lil' Ghost (Go), I'm in that lil' Don (Damn)
I'm in that lil' pussy, shit feelin' like a lil' pond
Tryna rob, you get shot soon as you steppin' on my lawn
Uh, boy, be gone (Go)
Fucked her so good she went 'head and turned blonde
Said she felt like a new person (Ooh)
Don't stop suckin' when I'm burstin', bitch, I'll reimburse you

Ayy, last night I broke a bitch back and a bed (Last night)
These lil' niggas do more cap shit than Lids (Lids)
Stacks so thick, it's to the point I can't spread (I can't)
Jumped on a jet, that's the nation off the grid (We gone)
Ayy, let a nigga play me like a bitch, it can't happen (At all)
Whole lot of blood on my piece, the chain graphic (Ah)
Chopper spit that fire good, it can train dragons (Yeah)
Brodie get that blue cheese off the green, it ain't salad
Ayy, hood bitch, but she actin' like she ain't ratchet (Stop playin')
Bust a nut on where she got her nigga name tatted (Right there)
Touch my nigga Yachty, get your top ripped, brain splatter (Boom)
I'm American, but I'll fry your taco like I'm Spanish
You might also like
Habla no ingle, mamacita (Brr)
Boat won't spend one dollar on a puta (Bitch)
Booyah, run up wrong, we might shoot ya (Yeah)
My niggas take your plate for the mula
Shoutout Meech on Mars, that's my nigga (Slatt)
One-eighty cash for Bent' truck, go figure (Yeah)
Lean, not no liquor, it's all in her liver, she leanin' (Lean)
I love God, but I be movin' 'round like a demon (Ooh)

Pull up in somethin' European, fuck up Niemens (Give me all that shit)
Probably with a bad bitch that's Indonesian (Foreign)
Fuck a restaurant, you hungry, bitch? Then eat the semen (Suck it)
You know I'm fresh up out the streets, I'm from that cement (Yeah)
And my city bankrupt, they see a foreign, then they know it's mine
If I die, my niggas did it 'cause my opps don't come outside
A West Side nigga fuckin' East Side bitches (All of 'em)
You wasn't in that field, I just looked at the attendance, nigga

From the state of Georgia to Michigan (Ayy)
Got my brodie five bands not to mention men (Ayy)
My niggas wipe your plate like it's Wimbledon
Boat emblem, rims tall as a grembelin
In Atlanta with that tomahawk, no Indians (Go)
I won't slime on my dawgs for the dividends (Facts)
But I'll slime up that bitch, better not let me in
Better tell a friend I'm not real like a alien1Embed
