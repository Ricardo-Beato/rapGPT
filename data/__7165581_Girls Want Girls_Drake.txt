Cannot play a player, babe
I grew up with Drayaface
I done seen the realest ones come and leave a crazy way
Had to take my spot, it wasn't somethin' they just gave away
Sorry to all my fans that might've caught me on a crazy day
Fuck you niggas thinkin' tryna block me on a fadeaway?
I've been on that shit, I only vibе with a payday
Say you go that way, I guess we both go the samе way
Girls want girls where I'm from
Yeah, yeah, where we both from
Ayy, and you just got to Miami, need hotel rooms
Niggas told you that they love you, but they fell through

My girl got a girlfriend
Ain't tryna be out of shape, well, stay up on them curls then
If gym don't work, get surgery
I'll pay for that, my courtesy
Can't imagine no bitch curvin' me
I put in that work overly
I handle business
And I got two pretty bitches, keep 'em both on fleek
They got matching Benz and matching APs
Now they can really call each other twins
I'm cool with all the owners, they love me, so they gon' let us in
And bring all of your peers, it look better with more people
We got 1942, Casamigos, it's getting heated
They gotta follow us in the Uber, my car filled up with shooters
It be lights, camera, action when you with us, it's a movie
I don't drive my coupe to house parties, I'm tryna leave with two of 'em (Shh, shh)
Yeah, don't nobody know the shit that we do
She like eating pussy, I'm like, "Me too"
I can't wait to get off work to go and see you
Please bring your girlfriend along with you
Y'all been on my mind too much, like what the fuck is wrong with me?
She said it's somethin' about the way your girl just makes her feel
Whatever you've been dreamin' 'bout, I swear to make it real
Just ride around the town with me
Then come lay down with me
I don't know (I don't know)
I might come, I might go, I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
I might come, I might go, I don't know

Starin' at your dress 'cause it's see-through
Yeah, talkin' all the shit that you done been through
Yeah, say that you a lesbian, girl, me too
Ayy, girls want girls where I'm from
Wait, woah, yeah, girls want girls
Woah, yeah, woah, yeah, girls want girls where I'm from
Oh, yeah, yeah, girls want girls where
Yeah, woah, girls want girls where I'm from

But I know you wanna roll with the gang
And I know you want the finest of things
Askin' me about se— settlin' down 'cause you know that things are going my way24Embed
