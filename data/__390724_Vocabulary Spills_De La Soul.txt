6 ContributorsVocabulary Spills Lyrics

Two times I'm the D to the
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic
I'll leave your brain stimulated
I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high
Always exhale the facts cause I don't inhale lie
Play the greater man's game, to bounce off my loss
Imma earn the acres the houses, and the horse
Of course it's much greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is the apex
Too complex, effects be live like Das
Making moves down South, to avoid the bull
And never, flaunt the coin cuz dime-getters be gazin
Call me Luther Van, they say my style is so Amazin
Fazin' those who're supposed to have the last laugh
Even when I'm gone I'm reappearing in the after
I have to, send respects to real money makers
Do not connect me to your champagne ho
Taste the quarter pound from here to New York
Don't swine don't eat no pork

Who am I? The D to the
And I'm the P to the

I'm the most, coast Eastern flav'
Droppin more knowledge than litter, on the New York pave'
It's me, Wonder Why, in the place to be
Certified, as superior, MC
While others explore to make it hardcore
I make it hard for, wack MC's to even step inside the door
Rhyming, sometimes
And when we get to racing on the mic, we line up to see
The lyrical killing, with stained egos on the ceiling
My rhymes escalates like black death rates
Over musical plates, being played as the rule
Kids thinking stepping to the Soul, you're labelled fools
Who claims to drop jewels but for now you do the catching
I don't worry on what crew you run, or what section of earth
You reside, you're not even a man nigga
Yo you not even a man nigga
So I don't deem it mandatory taking your pride
But I will, cause my man said Soulful Delight
You tried "Keepin it real", yet you should try keepin it right
That's understanding microphone mathematics
Leads to currency and temporary world status
And when one shows he posed threat to this one
This one will make that one into none
Simple equation, zero, you shouldn't play hero
If you can't stand strong like the Island I'm from
And I'm the P to theYou might also likeEmbed
