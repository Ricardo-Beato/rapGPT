57 ContributorsPillow Man Lyrics
I've spent about ten years tryna work on my craft
Tryna save this hip-hop shit and disperse of the trash
But all my nerves have just crashed 'cause all the verses I've thrashed
Were meant to benefit my future, I'm uncertain it has
I rarely ever put something out to insert in your dash
'Cause as soon as I became a brand, my whole purpose was smashed
I'm feelin' nervous, in fact, I got no urges to rap
Now I don't think my fucking life can get more worthless than that
I see these niggas blowing up who never do got the proper game
Niggas who fucking suck, Gucci and Waka Flocka Flame
Niggas who makin' bucks, someone tell me I'm not insane
'Cause I feel the urge to run up on a bitch ass nigga and rob his chain
Dang! I thought I had it figured out
See, I panic and I pout, yo, I've had it, man, I'm out
God damn it, this shit's a clout
I'm the baddest, ain't no doubt
But my madness is about to turn me manic 'til I shout

How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me?
Won't somebody tell me?
You can go ahead and fall asleep
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dreams
You might also like
You all assume I'm evil, but actually I'm so nice
I've always been the lover boy like practically my whole life
Unhappy here with no wife, don't ask me, I don't know why
I'm livin' life without no type of strategy to go by
I knew a bitch who I would go pick up when the day starts
A bitch who'd even like to watch me skate at the skate park
A bitch who I was making out with up in the graveyard
The same bitch who went and left my ass with a slayed heart
She cut it like an avocado
Secretly hittin' clubs and poppin' bottles
Hanging with thugs or sucking a lots of cock, yo
The biggest slut from Loveland, Colorado
Fuck a ho, that's Hopsin's motto
My heart is vacant, you knock it's hollow
She met another guy who left the baby stuck inside
Her vagina, then he just split and messed up her fuckin' life
Now she hits me up and I say, "Go suck a nut, goodbye"
All you sluts can die for wasting all my sacred love supply

How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me?
Won't somebody tell me?
You can go ahead and fall asleep
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dreams
To live a decent life, what all does it take?
I've tried and tried to be the best, but nothing falls in the place
And I'm a man, but my struggle is gonna cause me to break
And just evolve me to hate, I'm in a nauseous state
And, shit, it probably is fate, but who's in control of it, me or God?
Is he the cause? Then why am I here? The reason's odd
I'm broke and need a job for spending cheese on broads
But y'all don't see the flaws, I coat it up to keep it raw
And MC's who's got the most talent in this whole planet
Don't never get recognized when they dope at it
So they go back to the block hustlin' the dope addicts
Some niggas got the "it" factor, some niggas don't have it
Yo, I'm at my last ends
'Cause every time I think I'm out the matrix, I get sucked right back in
But, man, I'm hopin' things'll change and the soul in me remains
'Cause the talent that I got is way too cold to be contained

No, no
What did I do to deserve this?
No, no
I don't even have a purpose
(Pillow Man) No, no
(Pillow Man) What did I do to deserve this?
(Pillow Man) No, no
(Pillow Man) I don't even have a purpose
How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me?
Won't somebody tell me?
You can go ahead and fall asleep
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dreams
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dreams4Embed
