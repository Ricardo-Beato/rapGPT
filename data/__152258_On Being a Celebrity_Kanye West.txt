15 ContributorsOn Being a Celebrity LyricsI don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I ain't no motherfucking celebrity. I don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I'm a terrible, terrible, terrible celebrity. I don't know if you know this one thing about me, but I'm the worst kind, the worst kind, the worst kind of celebrity. Because all I do is make real music. All I do is sit in the studio and make real, real shit. And that's it. That's motherfucking it, that's motherfucking it
So I don't want nobody coming up to me with no cameras trying to like, sell pictures and shit to magazines. Asking me no dumbass questions. Throwing me off of my focus and shit. Harassing you all mothafucking day. I ain't no motherfucking celebrity. No, no, no, no it's not me. It's too much goddamn you. Lower, lower. Octave under
Y'all take the pianos an octave down. Yo, take away the "ha, ha, ha." No "ha, ha, ha." Take that shit
It's so funny, somebody asked me "when you do SNL, are you going to do like a skit about the paparazzi and shit and like humanize yourself?" I ain't here to apologize to no motherfuckers, man. It ain't about me humanizing myself. At what point did I become so inhuman where I had to turn myself back? Or maybe I was demonized, maybe I was treated inhumane in that type of situation. I ain't a fucking celebrity. I ain't running for office. I ain't kissing nobody's motherfucking babies--I drop your baby and then you sue me and shit
I'm trying to make some music that inspires people to be the best they can be -- And I don't want nobody to ask nothing else of me! Don't ask nothing else of me. Motherfuckers chasing you down about to make you crash into shit, and all they want you to make is a nigga to laugh and shit. Hell no I ain't doing no 'SNL' skits, this is my goddamn life, and this ain't no motherfucking joke. That's it, stop that shitYou might also like3Embed
