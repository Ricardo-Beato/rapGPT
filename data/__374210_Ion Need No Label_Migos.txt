10 ContributorsIon Need No Label Lyrics
Migos Gang
Migos Gang

I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label

I been had cash nigga, I don't need no label
Ever since a young nigga, I been chasing paper
Fuck with my block gang niggas in Decatur
Golf ball shots in your body like a crater
She fuck the whole team man, you don't need to save her
John Madden super bowl ring from the Raiders
You steppin' on my lawn, house with 44 acres
Go to the jeweler, walk out colder than a glacier
Wrist looking like a pack of fucking Life-Savers
Watch out for them goons cause I will put 'em on your table
Money stretching 'round the world like an equator
I don't need no label
BMG the label
Gone
You might also like
I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label

I don't need no label
Money stack like Lego's
I been getting money VVS's on my navel
Pull up in a drop top coupe, look like the Mayor
Two cup, styrofoam, filled up with maple
Pull up to the front of the club like I'm disabled
Two bitches in the kitchen cooking Vanilla Wafers
The Lamb outside, young nigga, yeah I own it
Don't like the mid around me, I don't condone it
Gucci aviators on my face to catch the focus
My bitch is not local, two bands around her shoulder
I don't need a deal little nigga I thought I told you
Pull up in a Lotus, to catch the haters focus

I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I don't need no label, I don't need no label
No Cash Money, No Limit
My money no limit
Riding in the Bentley, with the windows tinted
Foreign bitch is sucking, got to know they fucking
Rolling of a molly, rolling off a Xan
Calling up the plug for them stupid drugs
In the kitchen with them stainless steel like a chef
I don't need no label nigga I sign my damn self
I got loud, Xan, molly, and I got that meth
Pull up in Rari, Audi
The VVS's on my neck and rockin'
Been plugged in with the Haitian's
Stacking all my cash, Grants, Jacksons, and the Franklins

I been had a sack
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had guap
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
I been had racks
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label
Hunduns, still cash
I don't need no label, I don't need no label, I don't need no label1Embed
