14 ContributorsSMELLS LIKE INCENSE Lyrics
Uh, uh
No turn
Ayy

She already chose, why you trippin'?
She ain't that significant
Used to have a gimmick (Gimmick)
Glad I never went big with it (Ayy)
Now I got the big wigs spendin' (Big spendin', hey, hey, hey, hey)
I got Titos on the rocks
With some cranberry mixed in with it, oof (In with it, ayy, ayy)
She got a one bed one bath
And it smells like incense in it (Incense in it)

I got a chick and she a bit dim-witted
But she real pretty and she slim thick with it (Uh)
She let the whole imprint hit it
Now I'm cool, I ain't got no real interest in it
I know my innocence gone
'Cause it's 80 proof liquor all up in my system, uh (Ayy, ayy)
I don't jerk it when I'm finna get some
And it paid off for me 'cause I'm finishin' strong (Ayy, ayy)
But I don’t let the kids live long
'Cause the utilities and the renter's insurance is enough already
Tryna do the right thing, but I bluffed already
Tryna take it slow, but I cuffed already
You might also like
She already chose, why you trippin'? (Trippin')
She ain't that significant (Woo)
Used to have a gimmick (Gimmick)
Glad I never went big with it
Now I got the big wigs spendin' (Big spendin', hey, hey, hey, hey)
I got Titos on the rocks
With some cranberry mixed in with it, oof (In with it, ayy, ayy)
She got a one bed one bath
And it smells like incense in it (Incense)

Dirty clothes on the floor, Polaroids on the door
Told her we should talk more, but I'm going on tour (On tour)
Psych major, she a sophomore
Honda Accord on the parking deck, top floor
Know it's uncalled for
Got her on all fours, we was playing Uno
She said, "Draw four", I said, "What you wearin' drawers for?"
Bad biddies every city, know that we got all sorts
My dawgs ride for me, yeah, they onboard (Onboard)
Treat the two four beat just like a longboard
Fire code at the show, they want an encore
Ayy, ayy, they want an encore

She already chose, why you trippin'? (Trippin')
She ain't that significant (Woo)
Used to have a gimmick (Gimmick)
Glad I never went big with it
Now I got the big wigs spendin' (Big spendin', hey, hey, hey, hey)
I got Titos on the rocks
With some cranberry mixed in with it, oof (In with it, ayy, ayy)
She got a one bed one bath
And it smells like incense in it (Incense)1Embed
