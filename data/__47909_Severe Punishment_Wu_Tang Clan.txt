39 ContributorsSevere Punishment Lyrics
I despise your killing and raping
You're despicable (Are you my judge?)
It's just you should be punished
I'm gonna chop off your arm, so are you ready?

Check these high hats sling tings movin' through the rubbish
Party robust, rec room style for you brothers
Time's tickin', erupt misconduct
Enterin' one funk before the drum dry up
Dial, style, jab vocab slow
Alphabet run, construction voice might blow
Tap dance swellin', Hemingway novel model
For a breather, dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down, come with somethin' that's round and profound
Blood brothers, people of colors, we get down
Watch this fly, force feed things bein' said
Nine Diagram acid black evil red leathers
Mic half a dangle, serious a man
My mic clapper death wish, everlastin' plan
Heavenly God body, know me as the cleaner
Night champion, old villain style seamer
Kiss a spider, Seagal saga why bother
Godfather talk drama, fly swatters
You might also like
Number two, Chao San Poi

This Wu shit be hard to kill at full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editin' tracks that's rough
'Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough
So we attack this, and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggas, perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggas look on and get hooked on this mic line
Reeled in and shipped through the pipeline
LPs delivered with style and potential
Niggas flowin' smoothly in a sequential order
Revealin' hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura

Twist the DAC up, them niggas with math is back up
Watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
Playground maneuver, jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas, one chick, she's German Luger
Get the shit on
Light a fresh pack, bust it open with the seal on, dunn
Deal on this, with the real on
Necks rocky ring, call it the Decatur
Slang souffl√©er, home decorater, player
Mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance
Somethin' flashy, God dead-armed is nasty
Peep the ornaments enough to make Shorty-Wop stare at me yo
He killed the God, might as well throw a chair at me
Yo, MC's wonder what's hip-hop thunder?
Tell you the truth, it's just one nation under a groove
Gettin' down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz...
Yo, inhale this paraphernalia, a Wu memorabilia
Melba the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
'Bout the group recruit, we scoop up CREAM like Breyer's
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirty-six assorted, Shaolin imported chambers been recorded
You're fuckin' with the loops, time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism, Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body with five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millennium 2000
Wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I gotta muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell
When niggas is still rush in and brush you

He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives

Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
Ignite, blowin' the mic to Arabian heights
As I recite this medley, niggas couldn't fuck with the
Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceilin'
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuin' to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable
For this harrowin' experience
You scream for the extreme
Fiend for the capo regimes of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery
Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
Number one, Yen Chang Wa
He's an adulterer, don't trust him
Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?3Embed
