14 ContributorsRain Shower Lyrics
(Wheezy outta here)
My bitch a, uh, Richard Mille rocker (Yeah)
1017 for life, you know what I'm saying, no cap
No extras on it
Real nigga shit
And this, and this is just facts (Yeah)

Rain shower (Rain), rain shower (Rain)
My bitch got more jewelry than your partners (Yeah, yeah)
My bitch got Rolexes by the thousands (Rollies)
My bitch got APs, no apologies
Ranned up a million dollars then I iced out her
I turned to Austin Powers, then I copped a Spur, yeah
Her neck on Eiffel Tower, do she bite? Yes, sir, yeah
I fucked 'round and put diamonds on her goddamn purse, yeah

Plain jane AP (Yeah), fuck me, baby (Hey)
Fuck me and my friends, I'll buy you a pink Mercedes (Skrrt)
So many diamonds on my neck, got me feeling lazy (Yeah)
She bought me a Rollie with baguettes, it cost a eighty
My bitch keep turnin' up on baddies, yeah, yeah (Mwah)
Used to flip burgers out a Caddy, yeah, yeah (Used to flip)
She suck that dick without me asking, yeah, yeah
Stuff a ho with wood like a cabinet (Yeah)
You might also like
Rain shower (Rain), rain shower (Rain)
My bitch got more jewelry than your partners (Yeah, yeah)
My bitch got Rolexes by the thousands (Rollies)
My bitch got APs, no apologies
Ranned up a million dollars then I iced out her
I turned to Austin Powers, then I copped a Spur, yeah
Her neck on Eiffel Tower, do she bite? Yes, sir, yeah
I fucked 'round and put diamonds on her goddamn purse, yeah

Rain shower, rain shower
My bitch ass in Birkins, not flowers (Well, damn)
My bitch got more ice than these cowards
Like spinach, her pussy is power
Rain shower, rain shower
So wet, we had laid down a towel
So nasty, sweaty that we shower
Fuck doggystyle so long, she growl (Grr)
She suck 'til I skeet, then I'm proud
Front desk just called up, said we loud
I was locked up, my bitch held me down
Nigga play, then I'm gon' send him flowers

Rain showers (Rain), rain shower (Rain)
My bitch got more jewelry than your partners (Yeah, yeah)
My bitch got Rolexes by the thousands (Rollies)
My bitch got APs, no apologies
Ranned up a million dollars then I iced out her
I turned to Austin Powers, then I copped a Spur, yeah
Her neck on Eiffel Tower, do she bite? Yes, sir, yeah
I fucked 'round and put diamonds on her goddamn purse, yeah1Embed
