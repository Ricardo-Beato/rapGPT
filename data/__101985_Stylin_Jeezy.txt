13 ContributorsStylin Lyrics
Niggas wanna do it
Nigga, fuck it, let’s do it
See, this is what I do
So there ain’t nothin’ to it
If the conversation trap
Speak that fluent
In the club blowing money
Like I motherfuckin’ grew it

You see me stylin’ on your bitch ass
You see me stylin’ on your bitch ass
You see me stylin’ on your bitch ass
You see me stylin’ on your bitch ass

Gon’ step in this bitch
And I got plenty to blow
Tuck your chain and tuck your bottles
If you smart you’ll tuck your ho
These niggas know they ain’t fuckin’ with your Mr. Snow
I swear I get a buzz every time you talk blow
I’m killin’ myself
I am killin’ this shit
Don’t make me go there
Spend a mil in this bitch
See I hop in that Ferrari like I’m still in this bitch
The sun came up
And we still in this bitch
You might also likeWhat?!


Time’s up, take off the top
There it is, a half a block
And the grind is never-ending
Man, I swear it never stops
But you got a hundred thousand niggas shooting at your spot
“You the best that ever did it, ever done it” thanks a lot
If the subject drug-related then you know I’m going in
If they 25 a piece then you know I’m buying ten
If they find them chickens at your house
Your ass is going to jail
If you can’t weigh it with your eyes
You actually need a scale


Damn right it’s all true
Paid dues and made moves
I stay away from niggas
Heard them niggas bad news
Say the street committee say them niggas tellin’ on the streets
Got the nerve to hate on you
You know when that shit is weak
Top down, pistol out, you know I’m on the creep
Looking for a stylin’ redbone
I hope that she a freak
If that pussy good as I think it is I’mma tweak
Got on with the head doctor
And the bill won’t let me sleep

I’m killin’ myself
I am killin’ this shit
The grind is never-evening
Man, I swear it don’t stop
I’m killin’ myself
I am killin’ this shit
Don’t make me go there
Spend a mil in this bitch
Niggas wanna do it
Nigga, fuck it, let’s do it
See, this is what I do
So there ain’t nothin’ to it
If the conversation trap
Speak that fluent
In the club blowing money
Like I motherfuckin’ grew it3Embed
