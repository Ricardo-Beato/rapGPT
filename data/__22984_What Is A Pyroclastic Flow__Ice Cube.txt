8 ContributorsWhat Is A Pyroclastic Flow? Lyrics
What's the definition of a pyroclastic flow?

That's what happens when Ice Cube starts to flow
Red hot lava mixed with salava
Pulvarising everything in it's wake
Nothing can survive a pyroclastic flow
And no one will survive this oneYou might also likeEmbed
