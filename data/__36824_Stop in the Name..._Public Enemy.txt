4 ContributorsStop in the Name... LyricsThe almighty
Bring it on, bring it on
Ugh!
Yeah
C'mon
I like it for it to be where the level 
Alright now
Ugh!
Yeah!
I like it  the beat where the level is at
Full fledgin' never said I'm a legend
No shuffle or shoulder shruggin'
Uncle Tommin' nickel and dime rhymin'
This renegade rippin' rugged tracks, I love it
Sorta black owned like the Denver Nuggets
Pow pow the original hard hitter is back in black
On deck with a troubleneck
Uh ha you can drink all you want
But hard don't make the liquid matter you intake
The logical, sorta psychological brother like butter
Spread to one another, Lord have mercy!
Thicker the blunt and got sicker
Once upon a rhyme all bigger
Meant was for bigga cotton picker
Leave alone the men from the mice
Who twice packs the gats, turn into dirty rats
I'm comin with the antidote, I hope they cope
To the rhythm I wrote, come again oh yes lord
Pawns in the game, goin' down the drain
Final call to my race in pain
Stop in the name (Stop in the name)

I'm done, no title
Please, please, please
The world's biggest rap teaseEmbed
