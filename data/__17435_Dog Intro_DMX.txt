21 ContributorsDog Intro Lyrics
Ruff Ryders
Ride or die
Get at these niggas dog
Yup, yup, yup
I don't really trust humans that much these days
Shit, fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans
Shit, nothin' like that dog love I tell ya
Not just any dog, it's gotta be a pit bull
Yup, that's the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
It's all on how you take it

Nothin' goes down I don't get a small piece of
Get the picture, see the beauty in the beast of
The mad man, Mr. bad man is here
'Cause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air
It just ain't fair, the shit that I be doin' to niggas
And get away with the same shit, ruinin' niggas
Cover all ground and I roll thick like the fog
Only mothafuckin' friend I ever had was a dog
Never ate the hog but glad to say I smoked plenty of 'em
The 5th Precinct to name one of many of 'em
In one verse I beat you worse than your momma
I fuck around and eat you first like Dahmer's
I'ma, play that ass out like a bomber
Killed a nigga once for lookin' like he wanted drama
I'm buggin', the pain it hurts I gotta scream
AHHHHH! Lettin' off a little steam
Society was just too much, couldn't hack it
Six mothafuckin' years in a straight jacket
Yo black it wasn't wise for them to let me out the joint
I never really got better, so I'm not on point
I just might flip, quick, but it's too late to be bitchin'
Got more loose screws than the table in your kitchen
I'm itchin', just hope you ain't around when I scratch
'Cause like I said before, I eats what I catch
Searchin' shit will have a nigga hurt and sick
The dirt you kick will get you in the dirt and quick
Word to Miz, you niggas is kids, don't play
I'm too old for the jokes you'll get smoked, I don't play
I'm won't say what's gon' happen if you force my hand
Someone somewhere will be like, "Lost my man"
Take it to heart, it's about to get dark so run that
All that shit niggas talkin' been there, done that
What black? Think it's an act? Then let me know
But he liked what I'm sayin' so shut the fuck up and let me flow
Yo you think it's a game? Keep playin'
They gon' find your ass somewhere in a creek layin'
It's over you just ain't laid down yet
And in a minute you gon' be that mothafucka that they ain't found yet
Hold off from makin' movies and make moves
Stop talkin' about shit that you can't prove
I'm the mountain you can't move, so why you tryin'
Lookin' at me stupid wonderin' why you dyin'
While you flyin' through the air with a big ass hole in your chest
Wishin' you was holdin' a vest
But it's too late for wishin', so you gettin' this rest
Go to sleep, Papa will take care of the stress
God bless and may He have mercy on your soul
POP-POP, take these two more with you on your stroll, nigga
You might also like
Yep, yep, yep
I don't really trust humans that much these days
Shit, the fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans
Shit, nothin' like that dog love, I tell ya
Not just any dog, it's gotta be a pitbull
Yup, that's the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
It's all on how you take it
You know how we do baby
Aight
Grand champ
You know how we do
Scratch all day, match our weight
Fuck nigga
You can't be fuckin' serious
A raccoon ain't nothin' but a big cat32Embed
