For the first time in the longest time
For the first time in the longest time
For the first time in the longest time
For the first time in the longest time

This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long

I could see, I could breathe
Jеsus freed me, Jesus freed me, now I'm free
I got kickеd out the house for takin' sugar out the house
Steady, they don't wanna set me
My doctors on Sebi, my Christ is on heavy
My time is on petty, on gas, I'm on 
Four features on fetti, lightsaber like the Jedi
Trump's will like a medi, just come outside when you ready
How come a man, to gain the world and lose his soul though
Being the man I am, I never break the bro code
This year, I lost my best man and I lost my spouse
Only billionaire you know that's sleeping on the couch (What?)

This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long

Let it rain, rain, rain
I've never been one to complain
Let it rain, rain, rain
I put that on everything
Laugh/Love at me, never the same
What is they lookin' to gain?
Everyone look to the future
I hope we do something resorting in change, baby

This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long (Yeah)
This the first time in a long time (Yeah)
This the first time in a long (Draco)
This the first time in a long time (Soulja)
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
Used to be broke but I'm on now
I was just stuck at the bottom, grindin'
Now I'm shinin', sittin' at the top
I was just stuck in my feelings
Now I'm just ridin' 'round playin' with millions
Now I'm havin' racks to the ceilin'
Stackin' up cash, what a wonderful feelin'
We used to go walk in the mall to go shop
But now, we can walk in and buy the whole buildin'
We havin' mansions with acres
But honestly, we used to live in the trenches
I'm on fire like a candle
And God ain't gon' give you no fight you can't handle
Back in the trap, we ain't even have cable
Now I see my face on the channel
And R.I.P. Virgil, that OFF-WHITE is on me
The 'Rari, it's swervin'
I went to jail for that Draco
I guess that nobody perfect
Ain't givin' out bond I sat in that cell for a long time
Big Draco, big 'Ye
First time in a long time

This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long5Embed
