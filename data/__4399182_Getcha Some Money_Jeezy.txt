5 ContributorsGetcha Some Money Lyrics
You fly, playboy
Not as fly as me
 we ain't gotta clap bout it
 rap bout it
Want some money, I come to your trap bout it
34, Imma bust the strap out it
That gangsta shit, don't know how to act bout it
You want some salt? I cook some crack bout it
Baking soda all in the pot with it
If you want me, playboy you can come get it
All I do is talk shit and bust heads with it
In the street, playboy the feds with it
Y'all niggas be acting like some bitches with it
Get caught, turn state like some snitches with it
I know you fake, you ain't gotta flow bout it
Any disrespect, you gon know bout it

Before you knew what to do, I was doing it
Make a motherfucker sick like the flew with it
What the fuck you laughing at nigga? Ain't shit funny
You ignerint ass niggas need to getcha some money

I don't mean to be braggen
But them G's keep my pants saggin
I got an ass fat like Biggi
 get my shine on 
Plus I got a grand for the matching boots
If it's shady, I got my 45 that Imma shoot
I confessed it
Too many niggas that wanna test this
I'm the number 1 stuntress
Number 1 down bitch
Don't come with the soft shit
You know I'm down for traffiking bricks
All I think about is licks
How many licks will it take?
You got to get together and wait
Gots niggas that I gots to break
For this chetter, I want it all, from your platnom necklace to your Gucci sweater
This my ocupation forever
Imma pimp you, Ms. Peaches
Neva!

Before you knew what to do, I was doing it
Make a motherfucker sick like the flew with it
What the fuck you laughing at nigga? Ain't shit funny
You ignerint ass niggas need to getcha some money

OK fuckboy, gotta get it straight
I
I hit the block, and I flip weight
Young country nigga, but I flip cake
Nigga, I'm killing everything
, nigga, Imma let my nuts hang
Ain't no telling how many K's I might bring
And for you gay ass niggas tryna steal my flow
Imma tell you like this, but you already know
This my last motherfuckin time tellin your ass
 gon be smelling your ass
Niggas say they gon rob me, but I don't see it
I'm strapped in this booth, come at me right now

Before you knew what to do, I was doing it
Make a motherfucker sick like the flew with it
What the fuck you laughing at nigga? Ain't shit funny
You ignerint ass niggas need to getcha some moneyEmbed
