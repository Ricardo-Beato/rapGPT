3 ContributorsThe Motto LyricsGucci Mane;
Order more drinks from the bar, that's basic
Ten bottles of champagne, I ace it
Baby so horny, and I'm so wasted
Patron shots but I still can't taste it
Gucci Mane the shit, punk boy just face it
Woke up home, don't know how I made it
Walked in the club and the club got crazy
Told the DJ, Hey let's get faded
Higher than a white boy, I'm Slim Shady
Dancin' on the dance floor with your old lady
Maybach benz, Can I fit em in? Maybe
Drownin' in Don Piece, someone save me
Bricksquad's a army, no we're the navy
I'm a kush smoker, I blow kush daily
Hunnid dollar haircut, my temp fade wavy
The East Atlanta Mob told me its all gravyYou might also likeEmbed
