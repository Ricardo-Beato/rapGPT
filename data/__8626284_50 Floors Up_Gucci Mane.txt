5 Contributors50 Floors Up Lyrics
(Zaytoven)
Yeah, Juice
Chill, ayy (Young Juice)
Go

Uh, fifty floors up, I got old (Ayy), like donuts (Yessir)
If it beef, I cold cut (Damn), yeah, I keep that forty tucked (Woo)
I got thirties on my truck (Thirties), in the kitchen, cookin' up
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, I just doubled up (Woah)
Madden with the play, ayy, I just served some J’s, ayy
Do this every day (Yessir), yeah, still got the weight (Woo)
You can pull up, shock the day (Ayy), Sara Lee, I got that cake, yeah
Cook it in your face (Woo), A1 down to the shake, yeah (Shake)
Make you take them racks and go and stuff it in a safe (Ayy)
Save it for a rainy day (Day), still tryna dodge a case (Case)
Water, diamond like a lakе (Lake), stackin' lobster on my plate (Platе)
You could never ever hate, put them diamonds in your face (Ayy)

A young nigga from apartment, if we think that you got it (So?)
Just might jump out your garbage, just to rob you, we plotted (Oh)
Jackboy take your profit, leavin' blood on your carpet (Baow, baow)
Hit your head with the yappin’, knock-knock on your noggin' (Well, damn)
Lived my life traumatized, every day it was beef (On God)
Whole hood vandalized, wolves prey on the sheep (Grr)
Lookin' through my crooked eyes, I'm a dog off the leash (Grr)
Lil' cuz paralyzed, he sold more bricks than me (Really)
I don't like to fantasize, I see ghosts when I sleep (True)
I don't like to dramatize, I just say what I see (Huh)
Used to pick up cans just to buy somethin' to eat
But now I’m fifty floors up and I woke up on a beach, it’s Gucci

Damn, it's Ziggy, it’s Gucci
Zay, uh, we came so far from Mountain Park
We came from so far from Sun Valley
Man, it was hard
