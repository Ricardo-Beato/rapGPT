21 ContributorsPeaches (Intro) Lyrics
Yeah, mm-mm-mm
That shit sure feel good
Hey player, this Peaches
Coming back at you one mo' 'gain with a big what's up
Break out your black love, and your Boone's Farm
As I send it out one more time
For East Point, College Park, Decatur, and the S.W.A.T.S
We got that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik for yo' trunk
And it's fat like hambone, and tight like gnat booty
So let me take you deep, straight to the point
'Cause it ain't nothing but king shit, all day, e'rydayYou might also like1Embed
