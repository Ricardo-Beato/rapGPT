160 ContributorsBaptized in Fire Lyrics
Mmm, easy, back up, back up, back up, back up, uh
Turn your radio, turn your radio, off
Watch me now, baby (Baby)
Uh-uh, uh-uh

Bitches in my ear, they sayin' they love me
Uh, you don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fuckin' slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitionin' to my inner, I'm hearin' their voice
Tellin' me stay in focus, keep focusin', boy
Feelin' like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen', dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say, "Keep it goin'"
All my youngins, they dumb and reppin', they always knowin'

Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (Yeah)
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama (Yeah)
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home
Big bro, big bro, big bro (Yeah), big bro, back home
Big bro, we need you, come home, back home
Big bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home (Mmm)

High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher (Ayy, ayy)

Nightmares kept a nigga from closin' his lids (Lids)
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant, the hauntings ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie's so rock and roll
My princess Vada know rock and roll, Daddy got the glow
Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute (Yeah)
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (Yeah)
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home
Big bro, big bro, big bro (Yeah), big bro, back home
Big bro, we need you, come home, back home
Big bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home (Mmm)

High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
