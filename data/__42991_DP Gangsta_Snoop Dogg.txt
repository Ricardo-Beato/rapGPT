5 ContributorsDP Gangsta Lyrics
This is a public service announcement going out to all the paper haters
Now, sure, sure, sure, you're broke, sure, sure, sure, you're having problems
Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here -

Here's a little something about a nigga like me
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now I'm that motherfucker y'all read about
Smoking you out and your crew, taking a life or two
You don't like how I'm living well fuck you
This is my gang nigga No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute
With the pow pow bang bang and you're dead
And then we stamp that tank on your forehead
Everywhere we go they say "DAMN"
Them gangstas they be fucking up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no we too busy saying yeah
About drinking straight out the satin bottle
Do I look like a motherfucking role model
To a kid looking up to me
Shit life ain't nothing but weed and money
Shit I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck cause I keep selling
Yo what the fuck are they yelling
You might also like
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they selling
The bitches keep buying 'cause they love that straight G shit
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they selling
The bitches straight buying it 'cause they love that straight G shit

Homies all standing around just hanging
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll and we deal
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double (gauge) pointing at his window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said "fuck it"
Then we headed right back to Snoop's
Sweating on the bitches in the daisy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in the Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
So we all said "FUCK YOU BITCH" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga 'for nuttin at all
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs
I might stumble but still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
You fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailing
Yo what the fuck are they yelling
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they selling
The bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that straight G shit
Gangsta -

Hol- hold on Craig, B cut that shit man
Muh-fuck that man, we need some gangsta shit in this motherfucker
Some of that south shit know what I'm saying
Some of that shit from the thiz-ird ya heard me
Here's another gangsta down to ride
A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the tank but yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

Well I'm C-Murder the one he talking about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me you know they some haters
I said "See you later" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back with the navy blue top
TRU niggas on the scene with the triple beam
Cause I'm the C fool I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a motherfucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know you're jocking my crew
We want to fuck you C
I want to fuck you too
You see No Limit niggas don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fucking with
Cause I'm the kind of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'm a smoke your ass
I don't give a fuck cause No Limit stay selling
Now tell me what the fuck are they yelling?
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they selling
The bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that straight G shit

If you'd of just stayed down and been a motherfuckers real partner you wouldn't have had that problem
But seeing as you want to jump ship when you thought the ship would sink and motherfucker without just turning into a submarine, went under water came back up with a periscope looking at your bitch ass
Now you have no paper, and you on a paper caper
Now you coming up in my face and you're saying "Hey can I hangout"
I say "No" cause you ain't got no clout bitch get out
Now I'm tired of all you silly ass motherfucking paper chasing hoes
Uhh this has been a public service announcement from No Limit Records
