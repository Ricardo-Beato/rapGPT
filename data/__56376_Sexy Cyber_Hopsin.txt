23 ContributorsSexy Cyber Lyrics
Let's meet up tomorrow
How does twelve noon sound for you?

Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl

Can you believe it? She's finally 'bout to meet her soulmate
It's still trippin' her out; she's like "No way"
No more sad lonely nights of straight horror
Tomorrow she's meeting the lover God made for her
She's looking in the mirror, dancing around the house
With a mess of clothes on the bed trying on outfits
She's acting out how the day is probably gonna be
Like "Hi Pete, I'm so glad we finally get to meet"
She thinks to herself, "Hmm, I know what I should do
I'ma call Nicole up and tell her all the good news"
It went to voice mail 'cause Nicole was sleeping
So Lauren left a message, like "Girl, I'm gonna see him"
She hangs up and falls back on the bed smiling
Looking at the ceiling, daydreaming in dead silence
Eventually her daydreaming turns into sleep
It's love that she's feeling and yes the feeling is sweet

Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl

It already hit morning; oh darn
But Lauren so excited she wakes up before the alarm
And calls Pete, to see exactly where they're gonna meet
Then Pete picks up and tries to act like he was asleep
Lauren's like "So where we meeting at? We could try my place?"
Pete's like "Nah, how 'bout TGI Fridays?
I really love you Lauren, and I know you trust me
But it's our first time meeting, I don't wanna rush things"
She says, "That's fine, I'll see you at twelve
Until then I love you baby, hope you'll be doing well" *Mwah*
She takes a shower, does her hair and all that girl stuff
Make-up, lip stick, neck and wrist pearled up
Now it's about time she heads on out to Teej
She text messages Pete, "Hey, I'm about to leave"
And she's so damn excited as her heart pounds and beats
That she almost left the house without her keys, geez
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl

She pulls up, but Pete hasn't arrived yet
Should she go in without him; she hasn't decided
She doesn't really know how he would act if she tried it
So she just sits back and just relaxes her eyelids
It's twelve-twenty, Lauren picks up an appetite
She decides to go inside without him and have a bite
Then her phone rings, it's Pete so she answers it
Pete says "Baby, I'm gonna have to cancel it"
Lauren says "Why? What happened? What is it?"
Then Pete says "I just heard my grandmother's real sick
And I have to go and give her a visit"
Then Lauren says "It's okay, baby, go handle your business"
She loves him too much, so it didn't really bother her
She hops in the car, pulls off, a truck follows her
But she don't even notice 'cause her music's too loud
And she just caught up in the zone of a Ludacris album
Now she's home, she opens the door, moves to get out
Soon as the foot hits the ground, a man rushes up and pushes her down
She drops her keys; the man picks 'em up
Then drags her by her feet into her house like he don't give a fuck
He slapped her, then put tape on her mouth
To take from the sound of Lauren screaming rape really loud
He's going ballistic, her face is covered with lipstick
Then he yells out "Bitch, Pete never existed!"
Her heads spinning, then she just faints
The man rips off her clothes and Lauren gets raped
From that day on nobody ever heard from her
'Cause that so called Pete guy went and murdered her
He tossed her body in a off-road ditch
He said to her "see you at the crossroad, bitch"
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber

Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl7Embed
