Ah, yeah
Ah
Huh-ha
Fuck

I did way too much drugs, I've been swirlin' and spinnin'
I did way too much drugs, I've been swirlin' and spinnin'
Keep the fireplace warm, I'm almost home (Almost there, I'm almost there, mm)
I've officially lost vision, ha

I found my turf (My turf)
Bad decisions with the chrome in my hand (My hand)
I've been tempted to go clone my seed
I just think there should be more like me (Like me, yes)
Know you miss the thought of you and me (Ooh)
Keeping up with all the Jones', I can (I can)
Some are different, I keep ice in my hand (Hand, ice)
And I'm spinnin' like a modern home ceilin' fan (Fan)
I just balled up my fist, I cannot feel
I think I did one too much, many pills (Fuck)
I've officially lost vision

Oh, save your tears for when you get old
'Cause niggas out there ain't in the story you wrote
Realize who's friend and then who's foe
'Cause you got everything they want, you better keep that low
Doin' all you can tryna keep your hope
But I'll be gone, before you wake
Old memories, they start to fade
You'll always get a prayer from me back home
You'll always get love, even when you're dead wrong
These bitches get low, I can go lower
Vibrations is high, keep niggas on they toes
I'm gettin' in your head more than you may know
I'm here just breathin' (Ooh-yeah, ha, hee-hee)

I've officially lost vision
I've been sent to a mental prison
I've been forced to make some terribly bad decisions
All these voices in my head, I need an incision
I could see the sky fall, and I'll lose you (Ha)
This little tiny sheet of paper could change your life
It's chemically proven, It's chemically, uh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Huh, literally blind

Yeah, huh-huh5Embed
