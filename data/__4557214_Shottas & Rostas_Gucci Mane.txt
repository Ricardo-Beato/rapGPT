4 ContributorsShottas & Rostas Lyrics
You don't want no problems, got Rostas and Shottas
You don't want no problems, my partner got choppers
You don't want no problems, we got K's with sticks
You don't want no problems, my bro got that big stick
You don't want no problems, know we got more shit
You don't want no problems, we rich 
You don't want no problems, problems on problems

Nigga want them problems, we gon solv 'm
Slide deep in that minivan, we got revolvers
I'm tryna hit every man, we don't starv them
You know I'm pulling up, we don't do no ballin
 in this motherfucker, rolling with these motherfuckers
Hit the block, spray it up, and ain't nobody gonna know
We ain't no cops, but we looking for the plug, where he go?
Imma last, cause I never trust a bitch or a hoe
We gon slide through, 
I ain't gon shoot you, nigga, April fools

My , boom boom

You don't want no problems, got Rostas and Shottas
You don't want no problems, my partner got choppers
You don't want no problems, we got K's with sticks
You don't want no problems, my bro got that big stick
You don't want no problems, know we got more shit
You don't want no problems, we rich 
You don't want no problems, problems on problems
You might also like
If I pull up on ya, my nigga we on ya
Smoking on that cat piss, 
Ride with the hittas, roll deep in Toiotas
And we gon paint you, call us Crayola
My rostas got rostas
My partner got partners
My chopper got choppers
We block all them blocks up
We fly helicopters
Got shooters, got tappers
You don't want no problems
These better 
Better go call your passter
Now to Atlanta

You don't want no problems, got Rostas and Shottas
You don't want no problems, my partner got choppers
You don't want no problems, we got K's with sticks
You don't want no problems, my bro got that big stick
You don't want no problems, know we got more shit
You don't want no problems, we rich 
You don't want no problems, problems on problems

LA!
So I rep it like Teezy, I'm so bool
Bands on fam, no fam you
Saying I'm broke, must be confused
Swim in the money, Mr. Scrooge
Hit up Chroam, keep them 2's
Stick with the hammer, stick like glew
Hit up the homie, I'm a fool
OG, tripple OG, Terry Crues
Bang to the death, don't mean soon
Bang on the right, that mean soo-woo
Only a sniper, don't miss when I shoot
1 shot from the K knock him out, boom
Pull it back, 
Taste my bullets if you try to take my jewels
No vacation but you niggas trippin
Try to catch me slippin, nigga I don't snooz
Only make moves if it's about the money
Bro I gotta eat and feed my tummy
Saying I'm getting fat, cause you tryna get my kommas
Gun on me get you smoked like fire
Back like crack when I get a gun
Look like a trackmeet how fast a nigga runnning
Ame it at your face if you tryna get something
You don't want no problems, got Rostas and Shottas
You don't want no problems, my partner got choppers
You don't want no problems, we got K's with sticks
You don't want no problems, my bro got that big stick
You don't want no problems, know we got more shit
You don't want no problems, we rich 
You don't want no problems, problems on problemsEmbed
