This is a Dolan Beats production

I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
Y'all ain't think when we come through sending shots, we was coming right back
I ain't think smoking this loud pack would have me coughing like that
I ain't think when I pop this pill, it'd have me talking like that
I ain't think when I sip this lean, it'd have me walking like that

I ain't think when I bought my car, it'd have basketball seats like that
I ain't think when she get in my car, that she was gon' top me like that
She ain't think when I gave her this cock, that she would start walking like that
And he ain't think we was gon' pull up and get to sparking like that
I swear I think I'm one with my lows
I think I'ma put my bros over hoes
I think I'ma get that sack, go buy some clothes
I think I'm gon' get that sack, go buy some gold
Call Johnny Dang, like, "Put some stones in my charm"
I think I'ma need some stones on my arm
I think I'ma need a pond for my lawn
Full of big ass fish in my backyard like yawns
I think they want me go back like I was
I know I'm gon' get sack just to flex, ayy
Pull up on a bitch, I'm engaged with one of my ex, ayy
And that's a show and my ex name fifty grand, ayy
Pulled off, they like, "Sosa, thy the man," ayy

I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
Y'all ain't think when we come through sending shots, we was coming right back
I ain't think smoking this loud pack would have me coughing like that
I ain't think when I pop this pill, it'd have me talking like that
I ain't think when I sip this lean, it'd have me walking like that
I ain't think, ayyEmbed
