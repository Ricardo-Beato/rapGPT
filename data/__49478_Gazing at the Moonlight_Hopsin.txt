35 ContributorsGazing at the Moonlight Lyrics
Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers

It's really hard to focus living in this world of sin
All balled up in a corner is what I wanna curl up in
Some pearls an' Benz, money to spend, girls who's a ten
Fuck it baby, I promise I'll never hurt you again
People fiend to be the best, not the best they can be
I use to be the same way, I guess it's what Satan made of me
It's somethin' like slavery the way Lucifer has us
All this glamorous shit we like, he'll use it to trap us
Then he smiles as we run loose on his campus
And dances circles around us and you think it's fabulous
The glamorous, pay a price it's all hype, it's Satan
But in the mean time shit is all right
Most people think the message I send you is stupid
And y'all are gon' ignore it and just continue to do it
But as long as I made an attempt to convince you this shit's cool
The rest of your destiny is within you

Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers
You might also like
I'd rather go broke than go and give my soul away
My coldest day couldn't add up to Satan's prodigy
He's tellin' me to jump, but I'm sayin' I don't obey
They say your soul is not owned until your blood's on the page
And he don't have to own your soul for you to do his dirt
He's the master of ceremonies and that's why music works
All it takes is one rapper to make it big then through him
Satan will have the nation creatin' sin and he wins
Then repeats the cycle over again
For many generations 'til time is close to the end
And all those times you were saying fuck it
You'll be hit with the day of judgement and burn as the Devil's naked puppet
Take it as odd flows or take it as gospel, shit
I'm just speakin' the truth whether I make it or not, yo
You don't have to love just don't ever hate
And just know with Satan here, this world it'll never be a better place

Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers

So many times I have fell in this trap
I'm tellin' the facts, he makes it seem like hell isn't bad
'Til this day I still get influenced
And even though I know it's sinnin'
I'm willin' to do it, my ass ain't even improvin'
'Cause it's so hard to stop what's been taught for so many years
If I think about it too much I'll just be rollin' in tears
Sometimes I think "Why am I here? Why do I feel
Like I'd be runnin' in fear if ever the end was near?"
It's like, sin is in so much of everyone's daily habits
That we don't even know we do it whenever it happens
Then it settles in like I should've never did that shit
I wanna enter the gate perfect rather than have this
If you had to turn your test in today
You think you would pass it or would you rest in the flame?
Who knows, there's only one way to find out
And if you die now, no turnin' back, it's your life pal
Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers6Embed
