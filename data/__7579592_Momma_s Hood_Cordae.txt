Yeah, uh, yeah
Yeah, uh

I was riding through my momma's hood, rollin' in Jeep
I ain't playin' with you niggas, boy, I'm playin' for keeps
Fuck you pussy ass niggas tryna prey on the weak
I ain't talkin' too much, I only say what I mean
I bring the whole city out every time that I'm home
How you all about business but don't be mindin' your own? (Yeah)
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna atone, huh
I let that be well known, yeah

Daydreamin' while I'm schemin' on a text
Steady plottin' as I'm thinkin' on the next (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Confident although I find myself compressed
Overthinking, worrying, I must confess (Yeah, yeah, yеah, yeah)
Even though sometimеs I wish I was exaggerating
And all my problems were just figments of imagination
The smartest nigga who had dropped out, fuck your graduation
I think that shit a fuckin' scam, somebody had to say it
Caught up in a matrix, shit I had to find a way out
Lost too many niggas, swear this shit is gettin' played out
Student loan forgiveness, all my debt was finally paid out
Appreciate this shit because the gutter I come straight out
The bottoms of bottoms, to the top of the tops
And that power washing van that I just bought for my pops
I talk to him every now and then, more often than not
We upgraded next time that I drop, but for now
You might also like
I was riding through my momma's hood, rollin' in Jeep
I ain't playin' with you niggas, boy, I'm playin' for keeps
Fuck these pussy ass niggas tryna prey on the weak
I ain't talkin' too much, I only say what I mean
I bring the whole city out every time that I'm home
How you all about business but don't be mindin' your own?
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna atone, huh
I let that be well known, yeah

I heard the cage bird sing and it's a beautiful sound
And it'd be so much fuckin' better, dog, if you was around
Why they had to kill my nigga over a few little pounds?
When I got robbed in high school you even flew to the town
Couldn't really live with him, now I'm livin' without him
And you was just here with us listenin' to the new album
Told me that it was a classic, better than my last shit
We used to have hoop dreams and skip all our classes
And now my nigga dead and gone, shed these tears up in this song
Shoulda got 'em out, I right my wrong, real niggas shit what I condone
Every nigga got his flaws, accounts that's filled with withdrawals
I paint pictures that's vivid because my feeling so raw
This shit I'm dealing with, uh, is no mistake
That I was put in this position just to open gates
The niggas with the least to offer the most to say
The funeral was too much, I couldn't show my face, instead
I was riding through my momma's hood, rollin' in Jeep
I ain't playin' with you niggas, boy, I'm playin' for keeps
Fuck these pussy ass niggas tryna prey on the weak
I ain't talkin' too much, I only say what I mean
I bring the whole city out every time that I'm home
How you all about business but don't be mindin' your own?
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna atone, huh
I let that be well known, yeah

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This song is dedicated to my dog Juwan Walls
They called him Pit
Who got killed last summer in a shootout
And um, we used to be on the basketball team together, man, me and him
We always used to hoop together
And um, bro was the first one gettin' money amongst us all, like
He was like fifteen, sixteen years old
And he-he always kept a bankroll on him, and uh
I just miss my dog, man2Embed
