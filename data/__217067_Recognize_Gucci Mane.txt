You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
Do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
‘Cause now you’re all in my face, while I’m splashing all in your face

Well remember 1994, Freaknik, man I ain't had shit
In '96 the Olympics came and I ain't had shit
Used to walk outside DeKalb mall broker than a bitch
Window shoppin', window shoppin', I ain't have shit
Sold a nick for a dime thought I did some major shit
But the end of the day man, I ain't had shit
Me and Coca hit a lick but guess what, we ain't had shit
Me and Portro cooked some bricks but guess what, we ain't had shit
Me and OJ at the 508 man we ain't had shit
Had to give my lunch to me for free cause I ain't had 50 cent
Bought a 50 slab for Christmas it was the best money I've ever spent
Made the profit spent it so quick man that I ain't had shit!

You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
Do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
‘Cause now you’re all in my face, while I’m splashing all in your face
You might also like
Black Migo Gang you better recognize
So I thank God everyday I'm still alive
Bring you rappers to my block bet you won't survive
Niggas snitchin' to the cops they ain't got a dime
Quarter million worth of watches just to tell the time
I just left Colombia the streets is mine
And you can get a split nigga for a dime
And everybody rich nigga that I'm around
And I can make the work do the Julio
I put wings on the bricks and fly 'em to your door
All my hoes shitted on me five years ago
Now I'm shitting on these hoes like a toilet bowl

You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
Do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
‘Cause now you’re all in my face, while I’m splashing all in your face3Embed
