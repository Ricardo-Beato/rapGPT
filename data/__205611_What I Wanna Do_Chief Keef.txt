18 ContributorsWhat I Wanna Do Lyrics
You don't got enough cheese boy (nah), fuck wrong with you? (huh)
You ain't no street nigga, can't make no song with you (nah, nah)
Boy that ain't yo cheese, it don't belong to you (O'block, O'block)
I got so much money, I do what I wanna do (ff beep)
Wanna do, do what I wanna do
I got so much money, I do what I wanna do
What I wanna do, what I wanna do
How many cars should I buy? (Sos' baby) Tell me 1 or 2

Got 30 boppers, power pills, codeine, and that gunja (That dope)
And I don't do that molly, give that shit to Blood Money (Blood Money)
And we don't love these bitches we just fuck 'em and dump 'em (Bitch)
And boy don't test me, you're best be trying Obama (Bang Bang)
I pull up in that 'rari (Skrt) screamin' boy fuck your Hyundai (Bitch)
And I ain't gonna stop 'till Beyonce my fianc√©e (My bitch)
I'm flexin' on these bitches all gold bottles no Bombay (Nah)
Take 50 thousand dollars, I'll run through it in one day (Beep, beep)
I'm a Glo Boy I be shinin' from my wrist to my gold teeth (GBE baby)
And you better be talkin' money when you approach me (Go)
I been ballin' so damn hard I swear I think that I'm Kobe (Swish)
You say I ain't gettin' money, pussy boy you don't know me (Bang)

You don't got enough cheese boy, fuck wrong with you?
You ain't no street nigga, can't make no song with you
Boy that ain't yo cheese, it don't belong to you
I got so much money, I do what I wanna do
Wanna do, do what I wanna do
I got so much money, I do what I wanna do
What I wanna do, what I wanna do
How many cars should I buy? Tell me 1 or 2
