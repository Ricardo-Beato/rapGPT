52 ContributorsLAW OF AVERAGES Lyrics
You the only—
The story of my life started out
Lately, you the only one I can tell
Give in to insanity, paying the first loo—

Fuck a bitch, I don't trust no bitch
With my government (Fuck 'em)
Fuck a friend, I don't want no friends
With no open hands (Fuck 'em)
Count my bands, all alone at home
Don't you call my phone (Fuck 'em)
Everyone that I've ever known
Asked me for a loan (Yeah)
Leave me 'lone, .44 Stallone
Get a nigga gone (Yeah)
Raging Bull, this not Paid in Full
But I kill my own (Fuck 'em)
Yes, I love you 'cause you Black, but don't love your ass like that (Nah)
I will put you on a shirt if you fuck me out my racks (Dead homies)

Cherry Ave, Downey Ave, ho, you average (Ayy)
Louis bag, Gucci bag, you got baggage (Bitch)
I will never give my money to a bad bitch (Never ever)
I will never give my money to a bad bitch (For never ever, for never ever)
Dairy Ave, Locust Ave, ho, you average (Bitch)
Birkin bag, Chloe bag, you got baggage (Yeah)
You will never catch me slippin' out in traffic (Never ever, ever ever)
You will never catch me slippin' out in traffic (Ever ever, never ever, never ever)
You might also like
AMGs and SMGs, I'm into that shit, ayy (Dead homies)
Wasn't what he thought, we caught him like a catfish, ayy (Dead homies)
Niggas fallin' out and screaming like they Baptist, ayy (Dead homies)
Only love her if she ratchet (Yeah), ayy, if that ass sit, ayy (Yeah, ayy)
Got a squabble, now he Cassius Clay (Clay)
But I'm Hurricane Carter, you know I'm gon' catch a case
But "Lil Wayne Carter" what I call my .38 (Fireman, nigga)
Kiss your baby in the face if you play with where I stay (Where your kids, ayy)

Cherry Ave, Downey Ave, ho, you average (Cherry Ave shit)
Louis bag, Gucci bag, you got baggage (Downey Ave shit)
I will never give my money to a bad bitch (Nah)
I will never give my money to a bad bitch (Ever-ever, ever-ever)
Dairy Ave, Locust Ave, ho, you average (Yeah, Locust Ave shit)
Birkin bag, Chloe bag, you got baggage (You got bags, bitch)
You will never catch me slippin' out in traffic (Never ever, ever-ever)
You will never catch me slippin' out in traffic (Yeah)

The story of my life started out
Fuck a bitch, I don't trust no bitch with my government (Yeah)
Lately, you the only one I can tell
Give in to insanity, paying the first looks
I'm in your wild dreams16Embed
