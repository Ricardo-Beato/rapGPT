Baby girl, go 'head (Go 'head), go 'head (Go 'head, it's Greg Street)
Go 'head (Go 'head, Gucci Classics), go 'head (Go 'head)
Shawty got a ass on her (On her)

I'm tryna figure which chick I'ma see today (See today)
Picked up a young girl, looked like Lisa Raye (Lisa Raye)
When I seen her in the club, said I gots to get her (Gots to get her)
'Cause she look like she might be Trina sister (Trina sister)
Got a girl that look just like Lauryn Hill (Lauryn Hill)
Took her to the crib 'cause she know what it is (She know what it is)
Love her mama, but I can't stand her daddy, though (Her daddy, though)
But she got more ass than Jacki-O (Jacki-O)
Got a brown-skinned girl like Foxy Brown (Foxy Brown)
Bought a quarter-pound just to blow it down (Blow it down)
Tattoos all over like Eve or somethin' (Eve or somethin')
Long hair, but it must be weave or somethin' (Weave or somethin')
Got a spot, so I bought her new furniture (Furniture)
'Cause she pretty in the face like Monica (Monica)
I really dig the girl
So I gave her a ticket to Gucci World (Gucci World)

I got that fire red thong and the bra to match (And the bra to match)
I'm a real boss bitch and I'm hard to catch
Mac Bre-Z, pimpin' ain't easy, nigga (It ain't easy, nigga)
You can leave me 'cause I don't really need ya, nigga (I don't need ya, nigga)
I got a Chevy and you hear me 'fore ya see me, nigga ('Fore ya see me, nigga)

And I'm a top notch bitch that talk shit, but I take none (I take none)
Hair stay fixed, jump fresh with my nails done (My nails done)
My bracelet make niggas sick, so you already know
That when I step up in the club, I'll be rockin' stilettos, ho (Stilettos, ho)

And you'll never hear a nigga say I'm nasty, girl (I ain't nasty, girl)
And you'll never meet a girl that'll shine like me (Shine like me)

Too much ass, I ain't got no place to hide it at (Hide it at)
Hair blonde for a minute 'til she dyed it black (She dyed it black)
In the club with her girls, everybody pretty (Pretty)
Say she used to dance at Magic City (City)
Go, girl (Go, girl), to the flo', girl (Flo', girl)
Shake it real slow like a pro, girl (Pro, girl)
Hit the 'dro, girl ('Dro, girl), 'cause it's your world (Your world)
Dance one time, then get some more girls (More girls)
Gucci in the club, two rubber band banks (Banks)
Smokin' bubba kush and the shit just stanks (Stanks)
Six girls dancin' at the same time (Same time)
Never seen a hood ho so damn fine (So fine)
