4 ContributorsOn Taylor Swift and Artistry LyricsI did not diss Taylor Swift and I've never dissed her...
First thing is I'm an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship
2nd thing   I asked my wife  for her blessings and she was cool with it
3rd thing    I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings
4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop  like the word Nigga
5th  thing I’m not even gone take credit for the idea… it’s actually something Taylor came up with …
She was having dinner with one of our friends who’s name I will keep out of this and she told him
I can’t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!  #FACTS
6th  Stop trying to demonize real artist     Stop trying to compromise art
That’s why music is so fucking watered down right now
I miss that DMX feeling
7th  I miss that feeling  so that’s what I want to help restore
8th   They want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture
but you can see at Madison Square Garden that you can stop us
9th   It felt like a seen from The Warriors     ALL GODS   ALL GODS ALL GODS in the buildin
not just the famous people there    but the kids   the moms the dads  the families that came to share this moment with usEmbed
