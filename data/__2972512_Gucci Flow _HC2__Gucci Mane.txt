Yeah, yeah
Gucci Mane Laflare
Big Cat Laflare, Baby
Check it

It's obvious, I'm marvelous
Flopping is preposterous
Gucci Mane be dropping this shit down Amy's esophagus
Elaborant, Extravagant
Damn that nigga talented
And he a G I woulda handled just like he handled it
Late at night the candle lit
Deadly like a candlestick
Flickering just like a dancer bitch
Bugging with the camera flick
Gucci so enormous now
Vernacular, immaculate, sporadically, dramatically
Ol boy you been a casualty
A lot of niggas mad at me
Mad because my weapons stocked
Officially, officially, my memories, my repertoire
Pulled up in a cemetery, I got so many berries
I can't die for pussy niggas doubting my itenierary
..............................................
My buyers don't discriminate
Haters I eliminate, on suckers bet I demonstrate
Penetrate and infiltrate, it be easy to evacuate
Suckers I annihilate, you haters just might die today
Fly today and high today, so which might that I buy today
Smoke a whole damn fifth so I can think of something fire to say
I'm polarized, I strategize, strategically we meditated
Dead man is castrated cause the nigga hesitated
I drop it but I keep the drop
Take the chain and keep the watch
Keep the weed and take the whaaa?
Keep the weed and take the whaaa?
Stuff you hear is actual, half you see is factual
Gucci International, at times I am irrational
I'm militant and feelin it, even though I'm Killin it
Zip line sealing it, boosted my adrenaline
Flavorful like kerosene, greasy like some Vaseline
Gucci got the trap house trappin like a trampolineYou might also likeEmbed
