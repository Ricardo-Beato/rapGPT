5 ContributorsItâ€™s Over Lyrics
It's over, ya ya (4x)

Product of my ex-life
Call that girl my ex-wife
On to the next chick
I had to hit the exit
It's Over, ya ya
Girl it's over, ya ya
No more fuss and fights (huh)
You can leave my life now
No longer my wife now
Somethings can't be worked out
It's over, ya ya
Girl it's over, ya ya

I told you I don't want you no more girl and you keep trying (trying)
I had to change my phone number about three times (times)
Stop playing on my phone (phone), ain't nothing to talk about (nawl)
Cause sometimes girl shit just can't be worked out (at all)
I'm burnt down (burnt down), and I leaned out (and I leaned out)
Eating steak house (steak house) with my new b*itch right now (right now)
And I like her style (and I like her style), cause she treat me better (she treat me better)
Then she f*uck me better (she f*uck me better) we on another level
You might also like
I can't lie you fly, I can't lie you sexy
But the love is gone so I gotta find an exit
On to the next chick (next chick, next chick)
Cause I don't like the way you disrespect me baby

Product of my ex-life
Call that girl my ex-wife
On to the next chick
I had to hit the exit
It's Over, ya ya
Girl it's over, ya ya
No more fuss and fights (huh)
You can leave my life now
No longer my wife now
Somethings can't be worked out
It's over, ya ya
Girl it's over, ya ya

You think your smart (smart)
You think your sneaky (sneaky)
But i'm gonna break your heart (your heart)
Cause today your leaving (leaving)
Pack up all your bags (bags)
Pack up all your shoes (shoes)
Get the f*uck out (out) cause I'm so tired of you (oooh)
Flatting all my tires (tires)
Busting out my windows (windows)
I can't f*uck with you no more (nawl) Girl it's plain and simple
I leave you at my house (house)
You rambling through my things (things)
You know that ain't right (right) the way you violate me (violate me)
I can't lie you fly, I can't lie you sexy
But the love is gone so I gotta find an exit
On to the next chick (next chick, next chick)
Cause I don't like the way you disrespect me baby

Product of my ex-life
Call that girl my ex-wife
On to the next chick
I had to hit the exit
It's Over, ya ya
Girl it's over, ya ya
No more fuss and fights (huh)
You can leave my life now
No longer my wife now
Somethings can't be worked out
It's over, ya ya
Girl it's over, ya yaEmbed
