4 ContributorsDope Man Pushinâ€™ Lyrics
Dope man pushin'
Dope pushin'
Dope man pushin'
Dope, dope X2
On the corner
Dope man pushin'
Dope pushin'
Dope man pushin'
Dope, dope X2
On the corner

Nigga I ain't starvin, I'm the dope man
Got no fam, I'm heartless as they make dudes, I'm programmed
These niggas out here flashin, that's a no-no
I'm cut from that old law, We don't talk to Popo's
A killer out my door-door, you peaked in
Solo when I did dirt, bar none of y'all, I'm seasoned
Go dumb-dumb if they forcin' me to squeezin'
I don't hesistate cause I know I can keep a secret, nigga

Dope man pushin'
Dope pushin'
Dope man pushin'
Dope, dope X2
On the corner
Dope man pushin'
Dope pushin'
Dope man pushin'
Dope, dope X2
On the corner

Set up on my corner with my 50 pack
Sold it rock for rock, and then I double back
Moved around the corner, had them niggas pumped
Every other day, I scored another hump
Ounces, nigga, ounces up on ounces, nigga
Bitch, you out here frontin, you's a bouncer, nigga
Hangin' in that club, talkin' loud and shit
Bump that 45, and  got you out of this
Ever seen a nigga with that pistol out?
Walk up in your house and stick it in your mouth
Dope man, nigga, fuck you talkin' bout
Shoot yo ass twice, and then I'm walkin' out

Dope man pushin'
Dope pushin'
Dope man pushin'
Dope, dope X2
On the corner
Dope man pushin'
Dope pushin'
Dope man pushin'
Dope, dope X2
On the cornerEmbed
