Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, ooh)
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Louder (Louder)
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (Uh, yeah)
It's like standing in the ocean

We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
(Just let this wash on me)
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex (In the memory, standing in the ocean)
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace (Just let this wash on me)
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked (Feels like slow motion)
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic

It's like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (Wash on me, wash on me, yeah)
In the ocean, if I can't be loved
I don't know a sound
(That's right)

Standing in the ocean (Standing in the ocean)
Just let this wash on me (Ooh)
Bad memories like waves
Echoing (Echoing), echoing
Standing in the ocean (Oh, baby)
Standing in the ocean
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed76Embed
