13 ContributorsIâ€™m Going Out Lyrics
Going out nigga
Big guns and sharp knifes
Revolvers cause automatics jam at the wrong time(I'm going out)
Like fights with the brass knuckles
Swinging belts catching niggas with the buckle now fuck it(I'm going out)
Like I ain't got nothing to live
Like as if u had guns to my kids fuck it (going all out)

Yo you know the type that style and shit that rise my dick
Pop me a nigga quicker than police
Leave more wombs than a whole room full of chicks
You running while I'm gunning cause you a bitch
I heard niggas talking like they going to dead mines
I got enough guns we can make the headlines
I'm from a place where the realeast niggas get murdered
And the illest niggas try to avoid it
But can't call it
It's a cold world bundle up
Keep your heat on at all times
And never freeze up
And your eyes blink you could catch a hole in your tank
Have you leaking all over the place
Watch how you speak
And watch how you move through the streets
I got a mob with niggas with heat
We liable to squeeze 'fore we think
Breath 'fore is too late
Uph you fucked up and got laid to sleep
You might also like
(I'm going out)
With big guns and sharp knifes
Revolvers cause automatics jam at the wrong time(I'm going out)
Like fights with the brass knuckles
Swinging belts catching niggas with the buckle now fuck it(I'm going out)
Like I ain't got nothing to live
Like as if you had guns at my kids fuck it (going all out)
For the big checks and large faces mansions
And my duns would do the same for me

I'm going out like a nigga that ain't never have nothing
Fuck it I ain't frontin'
If I want to know I got to go out like a navy seal
Label me ill you sling thrills
Meet you on top of the hills screaming dollar bill
Going out like a nigga you just smacked
His moms in the cut plotting patient and calm
Putting on everything that I love and stand for
Getting bent up in the pub 'till five in the morn
Going out like a nigga with six days to live
And like a single parents raising a kid now that's a bid
Going out like a nigga with shit touching his rib
You got more than nesessary dun a nigga went dead
Going out for my niggas see this gat in my hand
You better back the fuck up what part didn't you understand
Have a nine aimed straight at your thyroid glands
Must've not been really your men them niggas that ran (I'm going out)

We do it well, clip niggas like nails
Catch cases, skip bails
I lie before I ti-dell, die in a ci-del
Pop guns with the shi-dell, fuck a bitch 'til she yi-zell
Rap style Smoother than C.L., in the K on the DL
Line for line you can detail, choked more niggas than Sprewell
Rap style P.L.O., watch me blow, like tornadoes
Clear the block out with just an echo
Trust me, niggas don't want me see let go
Niggas don't want to see the tech blow
Watch me move the crowd like techno music, nigga
When it come to murder, you know we do it for the cause
Fuck relyin' on the law, ain't worth dyin' for
I rather die fucking raw
Or walkin' on a mine in the cold war
My dogs got my shoulders, fatigued up machine guns
All my niggas soldiers
With big grenades, throw them in your rover
Send Prodigy to check the scene when it's over
Niggas animals comin' back for leftovers (all out nigga)

I'm going out
I'm going out
I'm going outEmbed
