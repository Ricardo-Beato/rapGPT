10 ContributorsD Line Lyrics
Baby girl, I'm high as the D...
Baby girl, I'm high as the D line
We got Glocks and chops up in the D line
My niggas posted like a street sign
It's a penalty if you cross that fucking D line

Baby girl, I'm high as the D line
We got Glocks and chops up in the D line
My niggas posted up like a street sign
It's a penalty, you crossed that fucking D line
D line
D line
Who wanna work Almighty D line?
Trapping out a mil' fast at the D line

Posted at the D line
Smoking dope up out the D line
You want some blows? You at this D line
Are you working for the po's? Tell on me hah
Bitch, it's just The Book Of Eli
Don't be tryna rob the D line, it's the beehive
Get your dumb ass stinged now
Get hit with 30 shots three times
She sucked my dick, that bitch GBE now
And she did it at the D line
My niggas throwing up the peace sign
I be throwing up it three times
How many you want, 50? Boy, I only got 23
Just came back with 'bout 60
'Fore you came back, switchin' licks, pass it to me
Bang

Baby girl, I'm high as the D line
We got Glocks and chops up in the D line
My niggas posted up like a street sign
It's a penalty, you crossed that fucking D line
D line
D line
Who wanna work Almighty D Line?
Trapping out a mil' fast at the D lineEmbed
