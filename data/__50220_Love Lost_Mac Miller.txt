(Our love was lost)
Hey, hey, haha (Where'd you go? Where'd you—)
(But now we've found it)
Oh yeah, uh (Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?)
(Our love was lost, oh, lost)
Doin' the happy dance (Where'd you—, where'd you go?)
(And hope was gone)
Doin' the happy dance (Where'd you go? Haha)
Doin' the happy dance (Haha, yeah)

(Our love was lost)
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
(But now we've found it)
And then you leave, now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
(And if you flash your heart, oh, heart)
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
(I won't deny it)
Broke my heart, can't find no crutch
So why don't you come on back home? (Can I spit?)

Hey, I'm a fuckin' workaholic with a passion in my heart
Treatin' rappin' as a art in which ya have to be a part of
I just copped a new car to hear it start up
Try to do the right thing and please karma
All I want to know is where the fuck did ya have to go?
I've been waitin' on you, baby
Why don't you leave and come on home?
I can't be mad, I'm livin' my dream (Goin' all around the globe)
Though you said you think you love me (You need to let me know)
So I've been fuckin' all these hoes and I've been blowin' all this cash
'Cause, baby, this just the beginnin' and I'ma make all of it back
You might also like
(Our love was lost)
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
(But now we've found it)
And then you leave, now you're gone
All I got is this damn song (Hey, hey, hey)
(And if you flash your heart, oh, heart)
So I can feel but I can't touch (Hey, hey, hey)
You said my love was a bit too much (Hey)
(I won't deny it)
Broke my heart, can't find no crutch
So why don't you come on back home? (Hey)

Hey, hey, It's all good, everybody tryna eat tonight
Tryna go to sleep, havin' good dreams tonight
You go home, it might get better
All I know: It don't last forever
So take it while you got it, try to get a little more
They say I'm gettin' better than I ever been before
Well, that's for sure, tell 'em what I do
Rap keep me fed like a spoon gettin' soup
I've been out here on the road and now they missin' me at home
All these ex-girls that I used to know are hittin' up my phone
But I ain't here, I guess you can call back
Sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll, I think I'll take all that, haha
(Our love was lost)
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
(But now we've found it)
And then you leave, now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
(And if you flash your heart, oh, heart)
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
(I won't deny it)
Broke my heart, can't find no crutch
So why don't you come on back home?

Yeah
Huh-huh, and it gets no better than this
Huh, yeah, it gets no better than this
Yeah, It gets no better, yeah, It gets no better
Yeah, It gets no better, this shit forever
Get no better, it get no better
Yeah, it get no better, yeah, this shit forever
Bum-bada-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, ba-dum
You can cut it here and then we're done8Embed
