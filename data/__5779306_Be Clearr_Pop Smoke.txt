38 ContributorsBe Clearr Lyrics
Long nights in the trap, it got a nigga sick
It got a nigga this far
Yes it did, yes it did, yes I did
But be clear

I just pulled up to TD in i8
We all getting money, then why hate?
Smoove hesi' the renty, like why wait?
We the hottest in the tri-state
My niggas gon' raise up the crime rate
If you try to play with me
So don't play with me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pull up to the party, guess what we in?
"Who comin' in?" I'm like, "All of us"
I'm from a town where we pour the Henny in double cups
It's enough Henny for all of us
We getting money, we mix the Buscemi with all of the Fendi, designer stuff
Just pulled twenty K, I've been getting my way
Top down in the Wraith, baddie giving me face
AP from a touch down, I just pulled from a Chase
Shout out my lawyer, he just beat my case

Long nights in the trap, it got a nigga sick
It got a nigga this far
Yes it did, yes it did, yes I did
But be clear
You might also like
Be clear when I say in Allah I got faith
I ain't jackin' a lot of you niggas
Got the ice on my neck, call me Bobby Boucher
Reach and I pull the trigger
I don't care who fake, I fuck with the real
I roll around with my hitters, hitters, hitters, hitters
Be clear when I say in Allah I got faith
I ain't jackin' a lot of you niggas
Got the ice on my neck, call me Bobby Boucher
Reach and I pull the trigger
I don't care who fake, I fuck with the real
I roll around with my hitters, hitters, hitters, hitters

Long nights in the trap, it got a nigga sick
It got a nigga this far
Yes it did, yes it did, yes I did
But be clear14Embed
