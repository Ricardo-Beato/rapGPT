I remember it was New Year's
You was in the studio when I did "Chosen One"
My nigga Double D was there
I started sayin', "Louis V chinchilla," 'cause he had the chinchilla on and shit
For real, you know what I'm sayin'?
This that Super Future, Fire Marshall Future, Future Hendrix
You know, the Wizard, you understand me?
You dig? You dig what I'm sayin', man?

Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly forget anything
Know I hardly forget anything, you know, ayy

Gutter nigga 'til the dirt
Margiela my fur
Almost overdosin' on Percs
Wakin' up, drinkin' that syrup
Bentley Spur with the curtains
Balenciagas my proteges
I wear them shits like Michael J's
Wash the molly down with champagne
Wash the Xanny down with syrup, yeah
Hope it take away all this damn pain
Hope it take away all this damn pain
You might also like
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly forget anything
Know I hardly forget anything, you know, ayy

Crack in the bushes, I'm tryna buy me a new '88 Cutlass Supreme
Every day hustlin', I gotta go get it
I gotta get Wu-Tang, man, gotta get cream
Long as they print it, my niggas gon' get it
All of my love, I gave it to my city
All of that game you gave me, can't forget it
All that finesse you gave me, ain't forget it
I turned the whole world up, now they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin'
These niggas so broke, instead of go and get it, they'd rather go ask for somethin'
Remember them days I had to load it up and put on my mask for somethin'
Remember we jugged for somethin'
Remember we take for somethin', yeah, yeah
I spent three stacks on these Rick Owens, I try my best to forget it
I pour my life inside these poems, my whole soul and my spirit
I'm easily agitated, get intoxicated tryna fight the demons
Tryna find right in my wrong, hope my legacy live on
Hope my legacy live on
That's why I wrote this song
I ain't have to write this song
Future Hendrix is forever
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly forget anything
Know I hardly forget anything, you know19Embed
