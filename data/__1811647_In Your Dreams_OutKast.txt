7 ContributorsIn Your Dreams Lyrics
We spent summer dreaming
When we could be leaving
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams

The moon is now my sun and the nights are now my days
Nocturnal creature by habit, Bruce Wayne know what I mean
I mean, I'm in between sunset and sunrise
Since it's on, type of nigga for the home invasion, surprise-prise
Motherfucka, pow-pow, lay the fuck down now
Naw naw, don't try to talk your way out
Because I'm usually non-violent, positively vibin'
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you
(Why?) I don't know, I don't even understand it
But it's simply overstood how you really 'posed to handle it
Pardon me one moment, I just went off on a tangent
Ha ha ha ha

We spent summer dreaming
When we could be leaving
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams

Typical day off in the A, aye
But Nicks own the Chevrolet, aye
Nigga wanna rob, okay, okay
Where he stand is where he lay, aye
Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill
I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes
Done like dishes, this a wrap like Christmas
Big Boi, you say the word I'll make these niggas dreams a nightmare
I will bust their motherfuckin' head
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

We spent summer dreaming
When we could be leaving
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
You're ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
We roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
As the wheels...
Keep spinnin', we grillin', bendin', straight pimpin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
Now we knowin', holdin', showin', controllin'
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up

We spent summer dreaming
When we could be leaving
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
Out here wild and don't give a fuck
See you when the sun come up
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams...Embed
