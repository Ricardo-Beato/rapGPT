17 ContributorsKeynote Speaker Lyrics
A keynote speaker's about to come on now
I just wanted to say a few words about him
And you all know who he is
Talib Kweli
Please, hold your applause 'til the end
We are glad to come and hear you speak
We love it
Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this
But one time we were drivin'
Through the Mississippi Delta
And there was a brotha runnin' up the side of the road
And he didn't have any shoes on, he didn't have a shirt on
And I started to drive right by this man; Kweli said
"Stop the car, because that brotha might be in trouble"
And I stopped the car, Kweli said to the man
He said, "Brotha, are you okay? Do you need a ride somewhere?"
And the man looked at Kweli and said, "Shhhh, I'm escaping"
And Kweli took him by the hand and said, "My brotha
You didn't get the memo, we have been free for some time now"
Well, I'm windin' it up
Please welcome a good friend, scholar
Ghetto philosopher, three time Nobel Peace Prize winner
First black man to pilot an aircraft
The nigga that made up the Nike Swoosh
The man that made Kool-Aid say, "Oh Yeah!"
Brooklyn's own, Talib KweliYou might also likeEmbed
