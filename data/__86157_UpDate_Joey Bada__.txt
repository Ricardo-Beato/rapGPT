24 ContributorsUpDate Lyrics
The force will be with you, always...

We should go out on a date, on a date, on a date, on a (date)
I'll pick you up around 8, around 8 around 8, around (eight)
She said that's great. That's great, that's great
Just don't be late. Just don't be (late)

It was love at the profile pic
We was Facebook flirting, never even met her in person
But it seem like we was soulmates on the phone late
She my one and only, be there when I be lonely
Whenever she get horny, she would call me
But we speak in code cause her pop dukes be nosy
Tap in to the line like, "Nigga who you trying to wife?"
"I heard you was a rapper, but I don't see no lime light"
"But look I got these iron sights, used to be in the army"
"So don't you be retarded and make yourself a target"
"That's my word mark it, and if you ever think about sex
I want you to keep in my mind that my name is Mr. Marcus"
"So, we will see who gets fucked, nigga"
Trying to run up out the door, I'm at the door like "Hey, what's up, nigga?"
"You out of luck nigga, choppa in my trunk nigga"
If you feel a way, then tell your pops I said, "What's up, nigga?"

I'll pick you up around 8, around 8 around 8, around (eight)
She said that's great. That's great, that's great

Oh, and by the way, I like a well done souffle
Sit up under the stars, nice view of the lake
And we can get baked. I bring the cake, you bring the 8th
It's no backing down, it's 8 doobies to the face
Fuck that, and if you act right, I might let you fuck that
Grab up on my buttox and what not
So you better be in order nigga
Don't forget the product from them corner niggas

We should go out on a date, on a date, on a date, on a (date)
I'll pick you up around 8, around 8 around 8, around (eight)
She said that's great. That's great, that's great
Just don't be late. Just don't be (late)

I got what you want, I got what you need
I got that fire, I got the trees
Now let's get higher, let's be at peace
With the 7 seas, birds and the bees
Said I'm down for whatever you down for
We can catch a flick or do it quick on the down low
I can go down slow, you can go up in
When I'm in my zone I ain't stopping for nothing
Said, I ain't stopping for nothing
When I'm in my zone I ain't stopping for nothing
When I'm in my zone I ain't stopping for nothing
Said, when I'm in my zone, I ain't stopping for nothing

I got what you want
I got what you need
I got that fire
I got the trees
I got what you want, I got what you want
I got what you need, I got what you need
Said I got that fire, I got the trees
Now let's get higher, birds and the bees
Birds and the bees
Birds and the bees
Birds and the bees
Birds and the bees
I got what you need
Let's get higher
Birds and the bees
I got what you need
Let's get higher
Birds and the bees
We should go out on a date, on a date, on a date, on a (date)
I'll pick you up around 8, around 8 around 8, around (eight)
She said that's great. That's great, that's great
Just don't be late. Just don't be (late)2Embed
