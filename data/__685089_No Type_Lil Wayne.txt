50 ContributorsNo Type Lyrics
'Cause I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
Counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
Yeah, my bitch got a wife
Yeah, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied

Yeah, bad bitch on my team, mmm
Bad bitch on my team, just like Katniss Everdeen
Got lipstick everywhere
I got her shaking on this dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick like a electric chair, lawd
I got liquor, I got cigarettes
And these pussy ass niggas just got PMS
I don't think you should see him, nor live off per diem
She just took off her clothes and said you ain't lyin'
She pretty like the bride of Frankenstein
She kill it like she married to the mob
I can't let one of these hoes lock me down mama
She said don't worry son I'll help you make bond
'Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eating carrot cake
So hard for me to put on a fake smile
I had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes
I don't do neither, it's at my bitch request
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck
Her suicide note say she love me to death
Ooh, for her Lewinsky is so critical
And I didn't mean to get political
I watch her, let her figure slither
But I don't look into her snake eyes
You might also like
I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet, fat as fuck, with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy but they don't get out of line
I'm sorry for the wait til I drop that Carter 5

'Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K943Embed
