I'm high as I can be, I'm high as I can be
I'm high as I can be, I'm high as I can be
I'm high as I can be, I'm high as I can be
I'm high as I can be, high as I can be
I got racks on me
And the Mac on me
I got X on me, nigga
And the packs on me, nigga
You don't know me, nigga
There's somethin' wrong with me, nigga
And I'm screamin' fuck the law
Can't control me, nigga

You can't control me, nigga
Can't fuckin' fold me, nigga
I'm a , nigga
This bitch nosey, nigga
She like, "Sosa follow me, nigga"
I'm like, "Nigga, profit me, nigga"
I got tons of broccoli, nigga
I done hit the lottery, nigga
Please don't bother me
I'm off lean margarita
With a bad mamacita
And a bag off the meters
But I'm spazzin' on people
Splashin' on people
Swaggin' on people
In a two seater
I'm gettin' it by the large
These niggas crackin' cards
In the double R
I'm peelin' off dodges
Community service, remember pickin' up garbage
This time around, I be goin' my hardest
You might also like
I'm high as I can be, I'm high as I can be
I'm high as I can be, I'm high as I can be
I'm high as I can be, I'm high as I can be
I'm high as I can be, high as I can be
I got racks on me
And the Mac on me
I got X on me, nigga
And the packs on me, nigga
You don't know me, nigga
There's somethin' wrong with me, nigga
And I'm screamin' fuck the law
Can't control me, nigga

Hit the mall, straight cash bitch we cash all the spots
Hit the mall with that bag, your little hoe jaws dropped
Bitch, we fucked all the thots, bitches fuck our opps
Thirty bopper, 44. Mag, we gon' to send our shots
We gon' to hit all blocks, you like come ride with me
Hit the mall, spend that bag she like, "Get fly with me"
I'm like, "More broccoli," just keep on top o' me
I got more guap on me, what's your philosophy?

I'm high as I can be, I'm high as I can be
I'm high as I can be, I'm high as I can be
I'm high as I can be, I'm high as I can be
I'm high as I can be, high as I can be
I got racks on me
And the Mac on me
I got X on me, nigga
And the packs on me, nigga
You don't know me, nigga
There's somethin' wrong with me, nigga
And I'm screamin' fuck the law
Can't control me, nigga1Embed
