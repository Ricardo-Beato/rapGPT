Dear mama (Dear mom)
Love you mama (That's on gang)
And grandmama (1600 Block)
Slatt, slatt, slatt
(That-that-that-that-that-that be Maaly Raw)

Dear mama
I don’t wanna sign off (No way)
Out here gettin' commas (Count up)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (Oh yeah, grinder, grinder)
She don’t want me locked up (Locked up)
Mama, I'm gon' wash up (Wash up, yeah)
Whip my wrist, it lock up (Yeah, okay)
All my diamonds rocked up (Oh yeah, okay)
I don't wanna sign off (Woah)

Mama love me so I can do no wrong (Wrong, do no wrong)
Mama in the trap so this her favorite song (Song, favorite song)
I'm gon' get them racks, lil' baby, they so long (Long, they so long)
Said I wasn't nothin’ but I came in strong (Strong)
You got the best advice but I won’t call (No way)
I know I'm grown so I do not need y’all (I got it)
And if I get locked up mom change the law (Oh yeah)
You fix everything, so that's what I thought (Thought)
When I was small, mama made me tall (Tall)
Even though I'm daddy's pup she still gon’ wipe my paws (My paws)
Don't care about this money, don't care about them cars (She don't, she don't)
Lose my mama, that's a problem you can't solve (Gang)

Dear mama
I don't wanna sign off (No way)
Out here gettin' commas (Count up)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (Oh yeah, grinder, grinder)
She don't want me locked up (Locked up)
Mama, I'm gon' wash up (Wash up, yeah)
Whip my wrist, it lock up (Yeah, okay)
All my diamonds rocked up (Oh yeah, okay)
I don't wanna sign off (Woah)

Now I got the game in a headlock (Headlock, okay)
Never catch me lackin', run a red light (No lackin' shorty, skrrt)
Bitch, we talk in codes, we the real slimes (On foenem)
They tried to break my safe, I had a deadlock (Deadlock, slatt)
Mama used to bag in the day time (Day time, I say, cool)
Mama got that bag by the night time (Night time)
Was on 32nd Street, I was like eight then (I think Cumberland)
Moved to Francisville and met my real friends (Bah)
Mama said, "Stay down there 'fore you get hurt" (1600, hurt, I was)
That was way before I was Lil Uzi Vert (1600, Lil Uzi Vert)
Mama saw me in action, it could've got worse (1600)
I know that my mama, know I'm shootin' first

Dear mama (Boo, bah)
I don't wanna sign off (No way)
Out here gettin' commas (Count up)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (Oh yeah, grinder, grinder)
She don't want me locked up (Locked up)
Mama, I'm gon' wash up (Wash up, yeah)
Whip my wrist, it lock up (Yeah, okay)
All my diamonds rocked up (Oh yeah, okay)
I don't wanna sign off (Woah)
Dear mama (Slatt, 1600 Block)
