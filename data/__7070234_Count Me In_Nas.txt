Count me in
Yeah
Yeah

Turn it up, let the radio blast
This a movie, can't catch it on HBO Max
Couldn't play me even back when we was playin' tag
White snow cover the roof of the navy Jag, that's crucial
Loose screws in my mind 'cause I didn't have the tools to
Unlock my power then influence you
To lock me down, it'd take two of you
Must be delusional, dawg, I'm livin' beautiful

(Three, two, one, let's go)
Count me in
Most non-sucker shit you could ever experience
Count me in
Sound of a four-five bustin', that's how I'm killin' shit
Count me in
Sit back and let 'em expose who they really is
Count me in (When you feel)

We livin' that life
(When you feel what you are)
No two lives are alike
(When you feel)
We livin' that life, life
(When you feel what you are)
No two lives are alike
(When you feel)

Ain't worried 'bout none of them, they bleed how I bleed
Suffering from the symptoms of King's Disease
Can't let the bright lights go to your head
I watched my day-ones go to the Feds
Fifth Ave, they snatchin' bags with the double Cs, they itchin' to up and squeeze
Shit is not a hundred 'til a nigga see a hundred Bs
Seen ego and greed take over and kill a hundred kings
Daily, a hundred niggas come for me
I'm tryin' to calculate the shit, they gotta count me in
Can't cure me with over-the-counter shit
Fireworks every time I turn an album in
When it ain't even July, I got it hot again
Majority on a profit split
We winnin' winter to winter
Q-boro don't get hit up
Get through any situation, my nigga, chest out, chin up

(Three, two, one, let's go)
Count me in
Most non-sucker shit you could ever experience
Count me in
Sound of a four-five bustin', that's how I'm killin' shit
Count me in
Sit back and let 'em expose who they really is
Count me in
We livin' that life
(When you feel what you are)
No two lives are alike
(When you feel)
We livin' that life, life
(When you feel what you are)
No two lives are alike

It's gon' be that, and that's on that
Yeah (When you feel what you are)
That's on everything, man
I just like to let it go where it's gon' go (When you feel)
I'm tryna tell you, man
We was drivin' (When you feel what you are)
Yeah
We socializin' (When you feel)
We's, uh, yeah
It's uh, yeah3Embed
