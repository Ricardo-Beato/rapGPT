14 ContributorsSalute Lyrics
Louboutin on the hoof
Wang denim
A good shoe for a bad bitch
Fuck with her
Eating with Jimmy Iovine
Lunch with her
She’s a get-money bunny
Jump with her
Bum bitches, bite my style, Dracula
Wear your Wu-Tang fangs
Novocane from Frankie
Reak banks apart
Your gonna need some backin’ up
Super-save these hoes
Cape Town, Africa
Catch me in N.Y, Uptown, the Battles up
Ponys and polo hoodies
All ready to saddle up
Mami, I’m no rookie, already the champion
Boobie you not pretty, you lookin’ like a regular
Blonde cuties, space cadets, astronauts
Most niggas is fruity, all Britneys and Ericas
Come and get me, et cetera, et cetera
Any challenge I bet I wet ‘em up
Barretta’s up

Salute, what’s good?
Salute a bad bitch you should
Salute, what’s good?
Salute a bad bitch you should2Embed
