(Right about now)
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

It's ya Eastside partner, Big Snoopy D-O
Turnt like D-Lo, catch me on your TiVo
Long Beach with me, the city and the turf, chump
Get turf stomped, fuckin' with the turf, punk
I'm geeked up, I'm on my tip ho
Turn it up, bitch, what you here for?
I'm goin' all in, that's what I do
My little niggas jerkin' - what's up with you?
This little rappin' ass, niggas tappin' out
I'm almost twenty in - the fuck you rappin' 'bout?
My niggas peeled-up, the homies growin' big
I'm all in the club, Rollin' 20 rip
You see a G, you better know the deal
You see the fellas, fool? I'm in the streets for real
I'm kickin' on these ho's, do 'em like dominoes
I slam 'em on they back, and tell 'em "vaminos"

I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Snoop Dogg)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I see 'em comin', huh, that's what I heard 'em said
The .38 the same color's the Chevrolet
501's on, gangsta lookin' good
I'm in the club, holmes, chuckin' up the hood
We the West boy, yeah, you see the shirt
Smokin' on that Kobe, fuckin' wit that purp
I gotta get her, mayne, baby hella thick
She said her name was Seven, call me Michael Vick
'Cause I'm a dog, ho, give 'em the dick and dash
Fuck what you called fo', if I ain't hit that ass
I'm Snoopy D-O-Dubb, I get it poppin', cuz
And when I'm in the buildin', they get to poppin' up
They get to spendin' cash, screamin' T-I-U
Now gon' turn it up, lil' mama look at you
I'm giggin' on these hoes, do 'em like dominoes
And slam 'em on they back, and tell 'em "vaminos"
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Snoop Dogg)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Boss Dogg chillin', lookin' like a million
Yeah, nigga got it, I'ma leave it to my children
Tonight, I'm on some other shit, and baby lovin' it
Hella fast, grip they ass like the oven mitt
I'm gooned up, boy, rich as fuck, boy
Black and gold brakes, that's my truck, boy
I'm on my Eastside, shit, I'm workin'
I got the party goin', and it's jerkin'
My niggas all long, we rollin' out thick
Ho's gettin' in, you better pick a bitch
'Cause when I shut it down, the party's over wit
She call me Superman, I'm on my Soulja shit
Boss Dogg, get 'em, I sick 'em and take 'em home
West Coast bitch, I'm on my fuckin' throne
I'm giggin' on these hoes, do 'em like dominoes
And slam 'em on they back, and tell 'em "vaminos"
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Snoop Dogg)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
I wanna rock right nowEmbed
