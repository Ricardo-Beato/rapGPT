33 ContributorsRoyal Flush Lyrics
Yeah, this is the... warm up

Okay, I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up
I blowed up, had a hole up in my pocket, now it's sewed up
They feinin' for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product
You niggas tryna stop it, better load up, I hang my coat up
Aye, I'm gon' be here for a while so I smile, haters
I'm on that green like a flower, like an alligator
Now or later, I'm serving niggas; I'm a sound waiter
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later
Look how I cater, dog what you afraid of? Nothing
They talking gangsta without no data, they fronting
Jackie-Chan, Jean-Claude-Van-Dam, straight stunting
I wish a nigga would say something
I'm a Carolina nigga, boy I got it on my back
Piggy back style I ain't talking 'bout no tat
And I'ma rep the Ville in every city that I'm at
And I guarantee I'm bringing home plaques
Shoutout to my brother Zach, and my mother, I love ya

Yea look ain't that about a bitch? This nigga on his own dick
They say I'm like the human body, I produce my own shit
And I toot my horns, a star when I was born
My name ain't James, my word is bond
Yea shoutout to Canibus, had a similar line 98-99
Damn, that was the times never mind dwelling in the past
You're listening to the future
The flows gets tighter, them hoes get looser
Then they wanna seduce ya like Medusa, be cool
I said I got a girl, she told me, "Me too!"
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood
Baby don't be foolish but call her I'll watch her do it

Yea and this is only "The Warm Up" yea7Embed
