GGP
Ayy, bang
Gang nigga, gang nigga
Bang nigga, bang nigga
Bang nigga, gang nigga
Sosa on the beat
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Bang, gang
You know how I'm rockin', cut off stockings
Keep kush in my pocket
All designer, get ya grind up

Glocks tucked, man, I up (I up)
I up, damage ya (damage ya)
Wassup with all these fuck niggas? (with all these fucks)
I'm sorry for the wait, I couldn't help (I couldn't help)
I was always smoking on the skunk (smoking on the skunk)
With a bad bitch in my truck, she tryna fuck (tryna fuck)
You see how my necklace it be shining to my charm (bling, bling)
I be smokin' dope, baby, I got vet lungs (gang, gang)

Blood gang, Blood dripping over here (gang, gang)
You want problems, you can get it over here (gang, gang)
You don't listen, you better listen over here (you better listen)
If you don't, I bring them pistols over there (with them pistols)
I come through and put the pistol to your ear (bang, bang, bang)
I come through, I put the pistol to your rib (gang, gang, gang)
I was getting money I was taking it as gifts (taking it as gifts)
I'm still getting money, I still getting it how I live (getting it how I live)
My wrist real, real chill, I chill (I chill)
I ain't never cold, bitch, I feel how I feel (how I feel)
I got 10 fans on, and I live how I live (how I feel)
I'm a plant that keep growin', and I peel how I peel (how I peel)

Glocks tucked man I up (I up)
I ah Damage ya (damage ya)
Wassup with all these fuck niggas? (with all these fucks)
I'm sorry for the wait, I couldn't help (I couldn't help)
I was always smoking on the skunk (smoking on the skunk)
With a bad bitch in my truck, she tryna fuck (tryna fuck)
You see how my necklace it be shining to my charm (bling, bling)
I be smokin' dope, baby, I got vet lungs (gang, gang)

Sorry for the W-E-I-G-H-T (the weight)
Bitch, I know it's W-A-I-T, ight B? (ight)

Ain't got no cuban links, I got on a breitling

We got cannons, Nicki, Nickelodeon, Jimmy (gang, gang)
I got that Cartoon Network, and that net work WG (gang, gang)
If you looking for me, I'm with money in a meeting (gang, gang)
Me and you, we got money disagreements (huh?)
Can't come to no conclusions (nah)
'Cause your money ain't worth me yet (what?)
If I upload a status, I don't need no feedback (nah)
I don't give a mothafuck who fuckin' with it (nah)
Glocks tucked man I up (I up)

Wassup with all these fuck niggas? (with all these fucks)
I'm sorry for the wait, I couldn't help (I couldn't help)
I was always smoking on the skunk (smoking on the skunk)
With a bad bitch in my truck, she tryna fuck (tryna fuck)
You see how my necklace it be shining to my charm (bling, bling)
I be smokin' dope, baby, I got vet lungs (gang, gang)26Embed
