21 ContributorsGet Lost Lyrics
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray to Lord fake niggas he keep
But if I shall die before I wake
I pray to Lord real niggas he take

I told my top to get lost
Cuz I don’t really like ceilings
I told a bitch to get lost
I think I hurt the girl feelings
So I hit the gas and get lost
I hit the thrust and get lost
I’m in that new Rolls Royce
If you don’t like it get lost

Me and my top beefin
So I don’t really wanna see him
They call me Gucci Mane la Flare, nigga
And all the kids wanna be him
I told that girl to get lost
Cuz I don’t even like to argue
All this money that I’m makin
They think I’m playing for the Chargers
My jewelery game is retarded
My car game is exotic
The inside my Maserati
Cuz look like hen in the hypnotic
I’m runnin from the paparazzi
But I’m in the Lamborghini
They call me Gucci Debiase
I think I’m fucking Liberace
You might also like
I told my top to get lost
Cuz I don’t really like ceilings
I told a bitch to get lost
I think I hurt the girl feelings
So I hit the gas and get lost
I hit the thrust and get lost
I’m in that new Rolls Royce
If you don’t like it get lost

Smoking kush with my boys
I’m a walking weed charge
They say I fucked up my lungs
I say it back, it’s my choice
Selling dope with my squad
Old school’s in my yard
I got a Chevy so clean
And a cutlass so hard
They city's getting real hot
So I took off of my top
I got the number one spot
I’m coming down my block

I told my top to get lost
Cuz I don’t really like ceilings
I told a bitch to get lost
I think I hurt the girl feelings
So I hit the gas and get lost
I hit the thrust and get lost
I’m in that new Rolls Royce
If you don’t like it get lost
Dragging from the old school in my new school
Top missing, nigga with my new tool
Same ways with my new juice
Getting money on these young fools
You pay for perfect when you’re big time
You pay for perfect when your sun shine
Harley Davidson, 1100
Nigga know we got them army guns
Big money when we poppin nigga
Overseas when I’m shoppin nigga
Hella choppers when we choppin nigga
Getting money by the mountain nigga
Uptown with the swag nigga
300 on the dash nigga
Out the pound full of cash nigga
Nigga first not last nigga

I told my top to get lost
Cuz I don’t really like ceilings
I told a bitch to get lost
I think I hurt the girl feelings
So I hit the gas and get lost
I hit the thrust and get lost
I’m in that new Rolls Royce
If you don’t like it get lost4Embed
