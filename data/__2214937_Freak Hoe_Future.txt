Freak hoes, freak hoes
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass, make your knees touch your elbows
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass, make your knees touch your elbows
Free dope, free coke
Lay it down, niggas kickin' in your front door
Free dope, free coke
Lay it down, niggas kickin' in your front door

Titanic on my wrist, bad bitch on my dick
Did a donut in the 6, I just drove by Magic City
Put that heroin in the bricks, put that heroin in the bricks
Put that heroin in the bricks, now your chain gigantic
On a worldwide treasure hunt, blowin' good Guinea
Pretty girls reppin' Pretty Gang fuckin' wit' the kiddo
Type to fuck a hood nigga good, then tell him "ditto"
Went from 5 on the indo, 30 rounds in the extendo
Fuck a friend though, ain't pretend though
Nigga comin' through sprayin' at the window
Get the memo, got a line, on Chyna White
But I ain't giving out no info
Get to bendin' corners like a nigga ridin' in a limo
I been in the pussy all day at the cribbo
I fuck a bitch, she tell her friend, I love some free promo
I love a freak ho' though

Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass, make your knees touch your elbows

Whole lot of dirty soda and some bad bitches (Bad bitches)
Put some rose on some gold tryna overdose (Overdose)
Made a ho' eat a ho' 'cause she a broke ho' (Broke ho')
Got that check on me, nigga that's a fo' fo'
My cuban link's bigger than the Wu-Tang (Wu-Tang)
Lil' nigga take your head off for a new chain (Yeah, yeah)
I send my side bitch out to St. Barts
I ride around town with a AR (Yeah)

Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass, make your knees touch your elbows
