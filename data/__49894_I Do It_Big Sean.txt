85 ContributorsI Do It Lyrics
I do it, I do it
I do it, yeah, like that, boy
Boy (B-I-G Sean Don, nigga)
Nigga, fuck yo' time, nigga
I do it, boi

I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour, I really can't lie
I was the man when I started, I'll be the man when I die
Man, these hoes take your money and I take they virginity
I'm high, I split an O in half and now it's a parenthesis
Crazier than crazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid
I put that weed in the air and pass it, yep, that's alley-oopin
Okay now, oh that's yo' girl? Well, I don't give a mass of two shits
Okay, I'm west side, west side 'til I'm died and underneath them tulips
You bordo like Enrique, I'm too paid, I'm three-paid
I'm looking like I'ma sweep stakes but I treat your girl like a cheap skate
'Cause I need a crib, a big estate, I need a boat and that need a lake
I need some salmon that need a plate, that need a chef so I feed my safe
My crew is who I'd be widdity-wid it, Rosé, I sippity-sip it
I'm Quagmire, I fuck hoes, my cashflow, I giggity-get it
Oh, boy, I'm cock-a-mamian, the most zaniest, insaniant
Pulling up in Merced-iance (Ballin'), rolling up like I'm Damian (Marley)
I love girls that's Arabian, Albanian, Caucasian
I ride around gettin' cranium 'cause my dick is hard as titanium
Oh, boy, you had your chance and blew it (You blew it)
Stand aside and watch a real nigga do it, bitch
You might also like
I do it, do it
I do it, boy
Boy, boy
Boy, do it

I feel like the world mine
Just bow down, the world mine
I'ma let you live, the world mine
This world mine, yeah

The one and only in this mothafucka (What?)
Niggas staring like we the only one in this mothafucka (Do it)
How could you not know we in this mothafucka? (Boy)
I got my haters looking lonely in this mothafucka
Woah (Woah), I'm sipping on whatever I get handed
Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus
Play your cards right and I could blow you up, nah, I ain't gambit
Shit, I'm wasted-wasted, this looks like a job for Captain Planet
Nah-nah, good lordy, whoadie, I just took more shots than Kobe
The realest niggas is reppin', the baddest bitches promoting
She put that thong on my groin-groin and then it go boing (Boing)
Got my fronter on her bumper, does it look like she towing?
I hustle hard like I'm finna lose the crib
And party hard like I'm finna do it big
All I ever do is big (So what?)
So all she wanna do is Big
Girl, what your name is? I really can’t remember
And Tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber
I'm up, up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like I'm Zeus (Ooh)
Bitch, stand back, watch how a real nigga do it
I do it, do it
I do it, boy
Boy, boy
Boy, do it

I feel like the world mine
Just bow down, the world mine
I'ma let you live, the world mine
This world mine, yeah
