43 ContributorsTaxi Lyrics

She was more beautiful than anything I've ever seen
Was the dream I had longed for, for many years
How it broke my heart to see her shed a tear
But she deserved it, I wasn’t perfect, nah, I never been
So tell me why the Hell was you expecting that?
Bitching and complaining, seems to me like you perfected that
If I would’ve knew I would have never got so damn attached
Found out that she loves me not, now I'm in this Cadillac
Please don’t panic pretty lady, I won’t do no stupid shit
Just wanna be the one you love, one you hug, one you kiss
It’s funny cause ever since you left I even miss the shit you used to do to piss me off
They say an un-tampered love is lost, so I'm not downing you
Really though, I'm happy that you found a dude, but anyway
Is the rope a little tight, it seems as if your wrists are bleeding
And I hope the tape around your lips doesn't constrict your breathing
Not much room, but the trunks filled actually
That's why I got you in the back seat, love taxi

That's why I got you in the back seat
No
Don't you know I love you so
So tell me why you wanna go
Don't leave me, alone
You might also likeThe screaming stopped, blood pouring from the razor slitting
But why the frown, you should be…

Sitting here, loathing in this ambiance
Staring at this shrine of miscellaneous body parts
I think of how we got of to such a sloppy start
And which seems worse, a slit throat or a tarnished heart
I guess I got the raw end of the deal
Because this pain'll last forever, yours ended in shrills
Now my life's a nightmare, but it seems so real
Our love was full force, yet you chose to yield
So we crash, face first, blood on the dash
I guess the best lesson in life, is nothing will last
Fast forward to this fucked up position I'm in
Contemplating why to live when I'm living in sin
But shit, niggas like me wasn't meant to go to Heaven
We was meant to be alone, die hanging from a ceiling
Try praying for forgiveness, but God told me to shut up7Embed
