Wild guap, a hot guap I think I need a side job
Dont hit me on my side kick cause I dont need Dodge Charge
Jive Turkey, Turkey, Bacon, Eggs, what your wife cooked me
Fucked her in your favorite chair, damn she got some good pussy
Wet pussy, throw that pussy, getting money, high money
Shawty getting good money, but that girl a big dummy
Dumb money, fun money, naw this ain't Young Money
Signed Wooh and Frenchie but Juice got his own money
So Icey Ent, Gucci got his own company
Ball money, mall money, y'all making small money
Biting on my lyrics, need to give us half yo show money
Blow money, Dro money, Drug money, Mo Money

Mo Money, Mo Money, Gucci Gucci Juiceman

Walking with a waddle and we still popping bottles man
Sex in the club, baby girl bet my sex better

In the pen for a murder, I am not a murderer
