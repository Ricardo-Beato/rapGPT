16 ContributorsGet Away Lyrics
Sometimes I feel I got to (get away) from these streets like a fiend for crack
But pullin me back, it's real got a nigga goin (ooh ooh)
'Cause no matter drama or gossip
My heart is your hood my dogs niggas I rock with
(Get away) before you get clapped put the tongue or two loose
Have everybody on the corner goin (Ooh, ooh)
Holdin they mouth shocked as fuck
I just had to air that boy out
(Get away) and now there's blood on my Timbs
Snitches callin' 1-800 crime stoppers
When they see me they like (ooh, ooh)
'Cause they want that thousand dollars
And not only that; police will die to catch a fucking collar
(Get away) and I'm out of here
Ain't no telling when I be back
Get rid of this gat, dog you know I flew
(Ooh, ooh) hell out of dodge
Nigga bout this paper, ain't no time to be sitting behind bars

I got to (get away), but fuck that; never let a nigga take me out of my zone
If he tryin to blown it go
(Ooh, ooh) wit no remorse kid it's the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimey retarded
You know
You might also like
You need to (get away), ‘cause I'm not playin
I'm bangin hammers on niggas
Put hands on that niggas life (Ooh, ooh)
Just beat the shit out you I brawl like animal
Your whole team scrambling (that's right)
(Get away) when we come through pushing new trucks
Bitches be pushing and shoving to look at us
They go (ooh ooh)
Yeah, take a good look, bitch
This might be last time you'll see gangsters like this
Then (get away) 'cause somebody bout to die
And it's going to be a stampede when them shots fly (blah ba blah)
(Ooh, ooh) Rip that nigga you know
R.I.P your soul just lift up and (get away)
Uh huh, yeah, you out of here, nigga!
I'll see you on that other side; bye, nigga!
(Ooh, ooh) (Other side, that's right)
Families cry rivers courtesy of my niggas!
We terrorize rappers when we...

I got to (get away), but fuck that; never let a nigga take me out of my zone
If he tryin to blown it go
(Ooh, ooh) wit no remorse kid it's the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimey retarded
I gotta (get away), it's either me or you
Believe me dog, know a nigga like you ain't got shit to lose
(Ooh, ooh) But you walking that thin line
I'm clapping you first time for a motherfucker tryin'
(Get away) And put it past me?
That ass be bleeding somewhere like a hemophiliac exactly
(Ooh, ooh) Shut the fuck up before it's too late, go at your gut
You ain't a gangster and yes you could get touched
(Get away) Saw it before, the henny was talking
It wasn't him, but you know that nine stopped that
(Ooh ooh) (Grow up)
I swear these niggas like bitches
Why is that ?
‘Cause these niggas always laying on their back

I got to (get away) but fuck that
Never let a nigga take me out my zone
If he tryin' blown it go (ooh, ooh)
Wit no remorse kid it's the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimy retarded you know
I got to get away3Embed
