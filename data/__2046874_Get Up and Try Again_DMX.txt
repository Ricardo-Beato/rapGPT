9 ContributorsGet Up and Try Again Lyrics
Hugh
Hey
Oogh
Aaaghoo

Get up and try again
You gotta get up and try again
What you gon' do
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you gon' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to

We make the moves that break the rules
A fool and his money are soon parted
So we take from fools
If and when you ever fall down just get back up
Drop something, stop frontin', pick that shit back up
Stand for something or fall for everything
Wait for the right pitch and miss with every swing
In the absence of the truth, bullshit prevails
So what they did? Fucked around, threw truth in jail
The objective is to keep you blind
So along with the handcuffs on your arm they got shackles on your mind
Seek and ye shall find (come on)
Accepting failure is the only crime (what)
Fall down eight time and get up nine
You might also like
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to

Plenty a times a nigga slipped and fell
Got right back up
Slipped and fell
Got up again
Slipped and fell
One time I didn't get up as quick as I did before
It was hard as shit gettin' up off that floor (real talk)
You want the raw?
Ain't even about that
It's about when opportunity knocks
How you goin' be on the ground and expect to answer the door
No matter how hard a nigga goin' through it
You get up
You better stand up like shit
I know I'm goin' do it
Don't expect
Any support from fake friends cause what you do with fake friends is figure if you done 'em wrong, make amends
Walk your road
Don't let 'em walk you
And every once in awhile it's okay
Let them think they out talked you or caught you
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do?
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to

Everyday we walk these dogs, we walk through the fog and
One day where you walk, we'll put you up in the morgue (check it)
The road was rough, but I'm built for it
And when shit get tough that's real
So I'm still for it
Make every move the strongest one
Get down to go hard
Cause the last yard will be the longest one
We know the difference between right and wrong so don't mix it
And if it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it ain't smoke, don't twist it
I just hit y'all niggas with a jewel right there
But most of y'all missed it (Check it)
You fall out, get the fuck back up, try it again
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)

Yo, 
Ain't nothin' too big for the lord
All you gotta do is have faith
Fall down, get back up and try again
That's all you can do
Accepting defeat is a sin

Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do when the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)Embed
