25 ContributorsBy the Bridge Lyrics
Hey there, are you listenin'?
I just found a dead man by the bridge again
By the bridge again
Spread your wings and take the leap
Spill your blood all on the street by the bridge again
By the bridge again
Why isn't anybody listening
This world is so beautiful, but then again
But then again

It feels like everywhere I go
I'm searching for something inside my soul
If I never find what I'm searching for
Would you still love me or let me go?
It feels like everywhere I go
I'm searching for something inside my soul
If I never find what I'm searching for
Would you still love me or let me go?

Hey there, are you listenin'?
I just found a dead man by the bridge again
By the bridge again
Spread your wings and take the leap
Spill your blood all on the street by the bridge again
By the bridge again
Why isn't anybody listening
This world is so beautiful, but then again
But then again
You might also like
It feels like everywhere I go
I'm searching for something inside my soul
If I never find what I'm searching for
Would you still love me or let me go?
It feels like everywhere I go
I'm searching for something inside my soul
If I never find what I'm searching for
Would you still love me or let me go?8Embed
