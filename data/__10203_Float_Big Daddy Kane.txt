5 ContributorsFloat Lyrics
Manslaughter, walkin' on water
I stay afloat with a note, the way a boat oughta
I'm too poetically inclined, one of a kind
True and divine, the genuine, breakin' a bond and gettin' mine
So freeze, I'm makin' it flow with ease
And droppin' the funkiest lyrics that ever been known to MCs
'Cause I can recite it fast, or even rap slow
Huh, man I can just talk and my shit'll flow
Because I mastered the rhythm, so when a lyric hit 'em
Just the flow itself'll tell you that I did 'em
So let the K-to-the-A-to-the-N-to-the-E
Show you the meaning of real harmony as I float

Float, float on
Float on, float on
Float, float on
Float on, float on (Peep this)

I'm always on the down-low, smooth and mild
But when it's time to get wild, huh, you know my style
I drop lyrics wham-bam by the gram
On a jam and goddamn
It's like a disaster that nobody goes after
Rappers turn ghost like Casper
'Cause battlin' me, you'd only meet your fate
You'd probably come out better tryin' to fight in Kuwait
To be smart would be not to start
Not even The Wiz can give you that much heart
Rap is like an art, and man, you know
That kind of makes me like Michelangelo
Not to sound conceited, either to boast with what I said
'Cause I'm too modest to ever lose my level head
But if I ever got bold and said I'm higher
I can give more reasons than Earth, Wind & Fire
Many follow in the footsteps, tryin' to get a rep
Off a lover and a smooth Black brother
But I'm knockin' imitators out the box
Because you couldn't copy Kane if your name was Xerox
I'm like the God in light, some of my writing might
Be too much for your mind to explode like dynamite
And if it sounds good to you then, get on it, doggone it
Capture this like a Kodak moment as I float
You might also like
Float, float on
Float on, float on
Float, float on
Float on, float on

In this third verse, I'm makin' sure mentals
See the way that you serve rap's like a death penalty
So back up off me, ain't nobody stoppin' Kane
I'm shittin' on rappers like I never been potty trained
That means defeatin', deletin' and beatin'
While all the tenderonis I'll be meetin' and greatin' are treatin'
And welcome to a new Terrordome
When I come to roam, you know daddy's home
Rhymes come at you full powered with might
They call in the SWAT team when I start to write
And declared my lyrics illegal weapons in every state
So I can get five to ten for carryin' a Paper Mate
Just a little bitty taste of this'll burn so bad
You'll wanna call me the Big Daddy Inferno
So don't even think about a battle, I sail without a paddle
In other words, I float

Float, float on
Float on, float on
Float, float on
Float on, float onEmbed
