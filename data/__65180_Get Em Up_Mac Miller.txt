24 ContributorsGet Em Up Lyrics
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up

The wheels stay spinnin' on the Civic, boy, I'm always on the move
When you grindin' all the time, there's a lot of shit to do
That's why I got Q, 'cause he keep me on the routine
I be too skeed, trying to kick it like Bruce Lee
Clean shoes, boy, new feet
And I'm never in the car with only two seats
I got a whip full of people, all fresh, call 'em 10 Deep
Motherfucker, we the future like next week
Young people don't see you as an equal
They just see you as deceitful, tryna send you back to preschool
You only gettin' one shot, no redo
Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue
Bitch, who the fuck you think you playing with?
I'm Justin Bieber meets Jadakiss
Here to take what's theirs, treat 'em all like Taylor Swift
Leave 'em in a daze, all like, "What day is it?"
Yeah, the boy got class, no Cambridge
Fresher than your man, girl, but whiter than a plate of grits
They keep wantin' more, I'm their favorite dish
This me, motherfucker, I ain't changing shit
You might also like
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up (Hey)

I got a brand new phone, rocking brand new clothes
Leaving every single party with a brand new ho
Yeah, I've done a little travelin', circlin' the globe
Always keep it movin', inertia on these hoes
Boy, I'm an asshole, girls call him a douchebag
This some old-school shit, but no boom bap
This ain't new swag, it's the same old me
The youngin get respect from the game's OGs
Cameras flashin' when we passin', so we stay low-key
Go to Mexico to party where the pesos be
On the turnpike, bitch, and your tank on E
With my head out the window screaming, "Get like me"
Ho, you should know the way I roll
Take a couple shots all to Superman these hoes
You ain't nothin' with your wack rap
Used to be the class clown, but now I get the last laugh
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up1Embed
