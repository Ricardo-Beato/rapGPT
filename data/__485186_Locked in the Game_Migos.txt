8 ContributorsLocked in the Game Lyrics
I'm a G
Locked up in the game
I'm a G
Stay in the Streets all day
Been addictid to it, they loved it
That's real boss shit nigga

This for my nigga that's addicted to the guap
This for my nigga that's addicted to the block
This for my nigga that been juuggin goldchain
This is for my nigga that been locked up in the game
Been locked up in the game
Been locked up in the game
This is for my nigga that been juuggin goldchain
This is for my nigga that been locked up in the game

I'm addicted to the game that i can't let it go
I'm a juug, i'm a cap that's the only thing i know
I'm addicted but do not call me a junkie
Cause a junkie do not walk around with all this money
I'm so addictive to the juug i can't stop now
Somebody tell me i need to calm down
All this damn juug money life is great
I Bought a jewelry truck and send that shit to 24

No one let me down to sleep i prayed on all my soul (?)
Cause i don't wanna be a j addictive to this dirty cake
Try to take my cake
And its going to be a murder case
But i dont care about the case cause my laywer going to beat the case
Beat the case, stop the case, eat the case, beat the case

Watch me eat that cake
And i recive calls from all ya'll niggas (?)
They way they talking celebrate me like i was at holyday

Therefore a dont' give a damn, fuck 12!
They always trying to look me up
But i got the cash to bill
I'm addicted to the game
I can't stay out these street
I need to see a million dollars
Before i leave these streets
These bandz all on me
But it's still a fucking struggle
I had to grind and hustle cause i had a baby brother
Now im harder, and im stronger
These niggas gonna try me because i keep that (?)

This for my nigga that's addicted to the guap
This for my nigga that's addicted to the block
This for my nigga that been juuggin goldchain
This is for my nigga that been locked up in the game
Been locked up in the game

This is for my nigga that been locked up in the game2Embed
