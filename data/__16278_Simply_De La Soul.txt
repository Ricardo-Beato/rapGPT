Fear through time is left behind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time and ease your mind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home

Hey, yo, last day of spring, first day of the heat (Heat)
I'm calling out my troops, so y'all best retreat ('Treat)
Tryin' to win the eyes off of Little Bo Peep
While I'm pushin' Big Bird up Sesame Street (Street)
After one nut, I'm goin' straight to sleep (Sleep)
If it ain't a love affair, its just a late night creep (Creep)
Use Colgate when I'm brushing my teeth (Teeth)
Favorite MCs Greg Nice and Smooth B (B)
Keep it old school like, "Where's the beef?"
And if you ain't from an era, then you up shit's creek (Creek)
First B-side was "Freedom of Speak"
If you don't speak, well I ain't losin' no sleep
See me on the cover of your XXL (L)
Takin' a holiday at the hotel ('Tel)
Fans keep sending me back the fan mail
Heavyweights keep it on the grand scale when we doin' it

Fear through time is left behind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time and ease your mind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home

Ayo, the sky swallowed the sun, spitted out the moon and stars
Couldn't outshine the brigade of cars
ArmorAll-ed down, the downtown activity
I'm 'bout to have fun without the problems that live with me
Not tryin' to be posh, but let's stay out the mosh pit
Tonight keep my nose out of trouble
Everybody in my bubble's been briefed
No beef, just party
Of course you're gonna have some clown niggas try to take us off course
Always lower levels tryin' to bring out the devil in us
Not condoned, but it's known
That a party ain't a party if the thugs don't try to shut it down
Tight security and it's still soft
Can't offset the thirty or plus caught in the rush
Keep the door sealed
'Cause the floor's filled with action
And we don't need any distractions tonight, y'all

Introduce me to your mademoiselle
I'm Tarzan and she's my gazelle
I live it big, some say it's notorious
Travel through minds, emotions, and euphorias
Glorious as I get great
Still kind of smooth like way back in my old school tapes
I bring it pronto
Rep the BX like Billy Blanco
Treat your troubles like colds, sweat it out, get it out
So we can get in the right mode, let it out
No need to pull on the throttle
If I could bottle this love, I wouldn't hesitate
Get it straight
Wonder why I can medicate the soul
While takin' its toll
Just for simply (Simply) havin' (Havin')
The right record that could bring in the pull
And this must be the right one, y'all
'Cause the dancefloor's full 'cause

Fear through time is left behind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time and ease your mind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home
Fear through time is left behind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time and ease your mind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home
Fear through time is left behind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time and ease your mind when you're simply havin'
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at homeEmbed
