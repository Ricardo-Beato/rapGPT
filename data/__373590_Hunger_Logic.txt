Psychological!
Damn right
Have you ever heard Psychological spit a verse son?
It's quite crazy
It's quite crazy son
Damn right!

Some walk a vine line
I sip fine wine
Rhyme ahead of my time
A fetus with a wise mind
Now you know it's on
Hungry like Ramadan
And mothefuckers I ain't leaving 'til the plate's gone
I thought you knew
Lactose intolerant fool
Don't eat cheddar but my wallet do
This is how a scholar do
Phenomenal, I affect like domino
Rolling through like Geronimo
I'm hungry like a third world child
80 sets a day, send it my way
I'm viral, infectious
My state of mind is bigger than Texas
I wrote this rhyme in my phone where the text is
'Cause I ran out of paper, if that ain't hungry, I don't know what is

Psychological, you know what that means y'all?
That means he is in your head for sure1Embed
