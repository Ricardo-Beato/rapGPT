Chance The Rapper, Caleb
10 Day, ohh
Igh

She working that thang, she know she got it
Lil' mama so bad, you know she naughty
Her do it so slow, now watch her take it
She giving a show, now watch her break it

Back it up like, "Juke juke", 3, 4, "Juke juke"
Hands on the tracks like "Choo-choo"
Can't nobody do it like you do
True, true, mama sip a little bit of that screw juice
Or a little bit of that Special K
And throw it in the bowl like Froot Loops
Hola, mami chula
Mami hol'up, mami slow up
'Scuse my French, my lingo but I no hable cinco
Her girlfriends say they 'bout it, you know that I'm bilingual
And Chano gonna mingle, I'm off a couple pintos
The bad hoes out on Saturday, it's church on Domingo
So while they out here frontin', go on back it for your mans
Because even when your friends actin' funny you gon' dance like
You might also like
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke
Break it down
Chi-Town break it down, Chi-Town break it down
Break it down, Chi-Town break it down
Chi-Town break it down, break it down

She working that thang, she know she got it
Lil' mama so bad, you know she naughty
Her do it so slow, now watch her take it
She giving a show, now watch her break it

Bust it, bust it, wide open, open
I been hopin'-hopin' shorty goin'-goin'
She from low-end, oh, and went to Kenwood? Me, too
Nah I'm lyin', she say she got somebody bitch, me, too
I hope that that shit do work out man
Cause this that new 'New Workout Plan'
And I'm that dude, you heard 'bout
And I hope that get your shirt off and if not
Keep on dancin' babe, all I need is that preview
Put you on the floor and show them niggas how to freak you
Slow wind, slow grind
On time, you can take your own time
But if I can't hit your ass on time
Gotta hit me online, you can't hit my phone line
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke
Break it down
Chi-Town break it down, Chi-Town break it down
Break it down, Chi-Town break it down
Chi-Town break it down, break it down

She working that thang, she know she got it
Lil' mama so bad, you know she naughty
Her do it so slow, now watch her take it
She giving a show, now watch her break it

Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke
Break it down
Chi-Town break it down, Chi-Town break it down
Break it down, Chi-Town break it down
Chi-Town break it down, break it down
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke
Juke, juke, juke, juke
Break it down
Chi-Town break it down, Chi-Town break it down
Break it down, Chi-Town break it down
Chi-Town break it down, break it down17Embed
