39 ContributorsPhat Wemin Lyrics
Old school Cadillac with the tint
If I'm at top, tell the fat woman strip
Premium Vodka, weed, and girls
And any other rap shit things you've heard

I treat you faggots like I'm Tim Hardaway
God got my Nextely, hit me if he gotta pray
What these so called dues that I gotta pay?
Old niggas scared cause the new niggas got the Ks beat
Key Nyata made, caught the body, caught the case
Big poppa pump, pop the trunk, blow a cop away
They soft as Petey Pablo helicopter blades
Choppin blades, like I'm pimping Chad
'97 slab(s), Saab 9000, color of Spinelli hat
Straight out the deli with that big Mac 11
And it's for the beef shreddin'. John Lennon of my fucking trap
Can you roger that, Roger Mayweather hands hard
Hitting when I go to bat, you niggas notice that

Old school Cadillac with the tint
If I'm at top, tell the fat woman strip
Premium Vodka, weed, and girls
And any other rap shit things you've heard
You might also like
Never fuck with niggas who can point out where your momma live
The shooters, cause 9  times out of 10, you lose her
That murder ain't a thing, got the Shawn Kemp Ruger
At the trap off Hoopa, fully loaded when I shoot it
Feel that loud hadouken ho, real trill, you should know
Since my days at optimal academy
Picture like Maddux with a magnum in the black Ford Galaxy
I hope he rages, ain't no point in dodging when I grab the 3
Shoot the 3, Reggie Miller 93, 31, 32
Harold Miner quick release, run and shoot
So if I was you, I would try and pay attention
Niggas trying to catch a buzz, I'm just trying to catch you slipping

Old school Cadillac with the tint
If I'm at top, tell the fat woman strip
Premium Vodka, weed, and girls
And any other rap shit things you've heard6Embed
