165 ContributorsSummer Friends Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh, incredible
My Lord, incredible
I believe

Socks on concrete, Jolly Rancher kids
I was talkin' back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank-top, nappy headed bike-stealin' Chatham boys
None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th Street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We were still catchin' lightnin' bugs when the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark 'cause the big shorties act hard
Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing
First day, niggas shootin'
Summer school get to losin' students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer, our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summertime don't got no time no more

'Cause you're my friend
Summer friends don't stay
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stay, stay around
Summer friends, summer friends
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, hey
Stay around here

Ooh, I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Mama hair salon doin' perms out the armchair
Dad was workin' late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns, fold my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh
Now I'm the same way, overtime all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessin', now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the flirt
'Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends

'Cause you're my friend
All my friends
You're my friend
All myâ€”
Stick around

Summer friends, summer
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stick around
Stick around, yeah
And some of us
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
79th, 79th, 79th, hey
79th, 79th, 79th, hey, hey, hey
You're my friend
79th, 79th, 79th, hey, 79th
So put your head on my shoulder
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide, hey
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide
Citywide, citywide, citywide
I will wait around for you
I will wait around for you
So lay your head on my table, lay your, lay your head on my table
May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful, grant you favor
And bring you back safely, I love you

When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed, a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends up37Embed
