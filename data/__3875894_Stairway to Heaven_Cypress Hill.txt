Yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah yeah yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah

I'm building my stairway, stairway to Heaven
But I keep finding my way back down (Down)
One more brick

When I die, I probably won't make it to Heaven
No singing no sad songs or kind words by the Reverend
No one sheddin' tears with happy thoughts to think of
The sufferin' and pain, I bring the one you need to speak of
I'm a bad seed, cultivated from anyone in need
I become cheap, one speed
Hit the target and leavin' your souls free
Call it the night, you never stood a chance
Dance with the Devil, two hands on the metal
Two vans in the shadow, one man in the battle
So I slam, I could kill a man, put my foot on the throttle
Tomorrow is gone, headed for the border
No sorrow for those left in the wake of my disorder
My fuse is shorter than most men
Pre-game, you livin' a dream
I send 'em off with no strings attached
I cut them off like a puppeteer, outta here
Don't ever see me again, I disappear
On the run, I live in isolation
These eyes in the mirror feel like the men we facin'
When it's over for me, the reaper surely waits
Standin' with my victims, waitin' by the Pearly Gates
Lookin' like they locked me out, I'm lookin' through the keyhole
Wishin' I could be inside, the life for never me, no
Runnin' 'til my numbers up but now my soul's in Limbo
I look into the darkness while I'm starin' out the window
And it goes
You might also like
Like one, two, shoot for the moon
It's like a three, four, fallin' back to the floor
Close your eyes, tomorrow's gonna be another day
When you wake up in the mornin', they'll be plenty bricks to lay
Like one, two, shoot for the moon
It's like a three, four, fallin' back to the floor
Close your eyes, tomorrow's gonna be another day
When you wake up in the mornin', they'll be plenty bricks to lay

I'm building my stairway, stairway to heaven
But I keep finding my way back down
I'm building my stairway, stairway to heaven
But I keep finding my way back down (Down)
