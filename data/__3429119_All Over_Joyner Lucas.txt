5 ContributorsAll Over Lyrics
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over

Just turn the other way
Yeah, shorty, it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
I'm gonna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over
I just wanna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Ain't nothing else to say
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Just turn the other way
Yeah, shorty, it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
I'm gonna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over, yeah

I said, bitch, you got some nerve (you got some nerve)
Yeah, you got some damn nerve, not a damn word
Wanna slap you up, but my hand hurt
Plus, I ain't hit no girl (I ain't hit no girl, man)
Got me on some cold shit, that low shit
That "I don't need you no more" shit
Bitch, I ain't got no time (got time for that shit, man)
Plus you always talkin' bout what you done for me in front of company
Bitch, I don't need you, I just got a new job (just got a new job)
Yeah, I'm getting my cake now, getting laid now
Coming home drunk, all late now

And I don't give a fuck, ain't no way, no how
I got plenty bitches, plenty hoes that want me now
I got liquor in my cup, music on so loud
Every time I hear you talking, imma cut you off and I just wanna

I just wanna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Ain't nothing else to say
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Just turn the other way
Yeah, shorty, it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
I'm gonna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
I just wanna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Ain't nothing else to say
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Just turn the other way
Yeah, shorty, it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
I'm gonna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over, yeah
Bitch, you got me all the way fucked up (me all the way fucked up)
Cause I ain't your average dude, no average you
Been playing games, ain't have no rules
Got bitches all on my nuts (niggas swinging and shit)
And I thought about marriage too, ain't have a clue you was fuckin' around with them ratchet dudes
Must think that I'm on drugs (you must think I'm great)
Shit, you must think I'm intoxicated or probably faded off liquor, weed or things I be taking
Just wasn't good enough (oh, I ain't good enough now, huh?)
And I heard your conversations from all the way in the room when you thought I was sleeping

And I don't give a fuck, ain't no way, no how
I got plenty bitches, plenty hoes that want me now
I got liquor in my cup, music on so loud
Every time I hear you talking, imma cut you off and I just wanna

I just wanna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Ain't nothing else to say
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Just turn the other way
Yeah, shorty, it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
I'm gonna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
I just wanna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Ain't nothing else to say
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
Just turn the other way
Yeah, shorty, it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over
I'm gonna rub it in your face
Cause you know it's all over, all over
I'm all over, all over, yeah
(All over, all over, all over, all over)
(All over, all over, all over, all over)
And I don't give a fuck, ain't no way, no how
(All over, all over, all over, all over)
I got plenty bitches, plenty hoes that want me now
(All over, all over, all over, all over)
I got liquor in my cup, music on so loud
Every time I hear you talking, imma cut you off and I just wanna
(All over, all over, all over, all over)
Every time I hear you talking, imma cut you off and I just wanna
Cut you off and I just wannaEmbed
