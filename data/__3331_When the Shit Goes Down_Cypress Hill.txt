37 ContributorsWhen the Shit Goes Down Lyrics
Livin' on fat pockets on full with the gat
Rolling around the nine deuce Cadillac
Still got my homies to watch my back
And they'll smoke your ass if you wanna come and chat
That's why some pigs and the kids come sweatin', they follow
A hollow point shell's hard to swallow (Hey)
Why wallow when you come to roll on?
I put the clip in the .45, bring your ass on
Left kicking dust as you hear the gat bust
My crib's surrounded, I'm about to get rushed
I brushed with death
How many shells stuffed in my closet
Where my big chrome things kept

When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(You better be ready)

I told the boys get the sawed off Glock and the rest of the gats
As I strapped on the bullet-proof vest
Boom, I think I caught one to the chest
Hot damn, I didn't wanna kill a man
Shit, I still stand tall with the hill clan, y'all better stand back
Niggas 'bout to fall
I'm coming out blasting like Yosemite Sam
Got the cheese and the bread for the ham
You might also like
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(You better be ready)8Embed
