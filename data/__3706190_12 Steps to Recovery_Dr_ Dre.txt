17 Contributors12 Steps to Recovery Lyrics
Break out your fuckin' swishas
Light up your fuckin' weed
I'd like to introduce you all to The Chronic III
It's D R period Dre motherfucka
Back to set the record straight for motherfuckers

I gotta be the number one supplier
I keep you higher than Richard Pryor
I been the dope man since '86 ('86)
From a nigga with a attitude to a nigga that's fuckin' rich
I'm feeling better than I've ever been
A lot stronger, plus I got a bet I win (bet I win)
I'm takin' all bets, fuck it I'm all in
And when I'm finished with this business I will be number
(one, one, one)
Started out on the turn tables, but look how the tables turned
You can't imagine what my label earned
I gross more in a year than most niggas make in their whole career
I'm only here (two, two, two) make sure I shake up your rear view
And you niggas could not see me with a clear view
If I was you I'd probably hate me too
'Cause yeah you got a budget but you can't fit Dre in it
It's (three) album solo, the Aftermath logo
Platinum plus 'cause I don't go gold, you know
My stats, ain't got enough wall for all my plaques
Niggas actin' like I wasn't comin' back
(Four) more, I'm too in love with this shit, plus I came too far to quit
And it was in nine (five) I got sick of niggas trippin' and shit
So I started building my label, sometime in 9 (six)
Adjust the levels on my mic so it's loud and clear (testin')
This is something that I want the whole world to hear (world to hear)
(Seven) I'm tired of niggas blamin' sales on the industry
The music ain't shit, and personally it's offendin' me

Fuckin' with the D-R, find yourself an E-R
Need C-P-R, do you know who we are?
Love cognac and cigars, so high I don't see y'all
On a whole 'nother level, that's why I couldn't be y'all
(Eight) straight summers they've been patiently waitin'
And I-, I'd like to thank you all for being patient
I-, I'd like to shout out all the critics for hatin'
'Cause you've only been the fuel for my motivation
(Nine) you cat's lives is limited
While I got black cards for all of my businesses
And there's (ten) million reasons why you can't fuck with Detox
And I'm the biggest influence in hip-hop
(Eleven) I can't stop (can't stop), look what I started (thanks to hip-hop)
I get the most pay, because I work the hardest
(Twelve) "Should've been Number 1 to me"
It's hard work to you, but it's fun for me
