15 ContributorsYou My Number One Lyrics
Turn the music up for me Chris
Baby, you my number one
CB on the beat

Baby, you's my number one, she's my number two
You know I gotta come home, girl, what's up with you?
That girl might be bad, but she can't fuck with you though
You know you my mamacita, I'm yo papi chulo
She's pulling on my hair, biting on my ear
Baby, give me overtime, I can be your night shift
You want me to buzz you, I can be your lightyear
Girl, I got a letter, I'm gon' start it off with my dear

Dear miss, remember when I first saw ya
Didn't know how to approach ya
I was gonna approach you like this
"Baby, do you like lasagnaâ€‹?"
I like California, I can ball, no pneumonia
Swish, baby can you grant my wish?
If I pick you up at like 6?
I'ma leave my phone in the car
Just don't touch my shit
I was gonna approach you like this
"Can you be my bitch?"
But I'm a player, I'm on, no light switch
She like, "what you getting into tonight?"
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Girl, I promise I'm gon' milk you right
Moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, moo

Baby, you's my number one, she's my number two
You know I gotta come home, girl, what's up with you?
That girl might be bad, but she can't fuck with you though
You know you my mamacita, I'm yo papi chulo
She's pulling on my hair, biting on my ear
Baby, give me overtime, I can be your night shift
You want me to buzz you, I can be your lightyear
Girl, I got a letter, I'm gon' start it off with my dear

Excuse me, lady
Excuse me, baby
Excuse me, crazy
You like how I stroke like, ooh-wee baby
Big ass guns and she's like, "ooh, he's crazy"
My Rapunzel, she's like, "ooh-wee, take me"
She gon' let me bone, bone, bone, bone
Her hair so long, we fuck all night long
I can call her on her home phone
I'm outerspace, she told me phone home
Ayy, no way
Got your ass done, does it ache?
When it's done healing, will it shake?
I can be the pill that you gotta take
Baby, you's my number one, she's my number two
You know I gotta come home, girl, what's up with you?
That girl might be bad, but she can't fuck with you though
You know you my mamacita, I'm yo papi chulo
She's pulling on my hair, biting on my ear
Baby, give me overtime, I can be your night shift
You want me to buzz you, I can be your lightyear
Girl, I got a letter, I'm gon' start it off with my dear2Embed
