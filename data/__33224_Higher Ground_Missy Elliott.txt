7 ContributorsHigher Ground Lyrics
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, mmm-mmhm
I'm movin', higher ground
Ohh

I'm movin' on (Mmhm)
Can't nothin' stop me now
(Mmm, yeah) I'm pressin on
(Higher ground) to higher ground
(Mmm) Each step I take (Oooh)
Is a new dawning of
(Ohh, oh-ohh)
A brand new day
(Higher ground) For higher ground

Obstacles and situations, people, places, and things
I must overcome, 'cause there's a battle to be won
With my mind set on higher things
These things have become my footstool
I'm determined to reach my goal
I need peace for my soul
You might also like
(Ohh) I'm movin' on
(That's why I'm movin' on)
Can't nothin' stop me now
(I'm pressin' on)
I'm pressin' on
(To higher ground) to higher ground
(Mmm) Each step I take
(Each step I take) Is a new dawning of
(For my higher place) A brand new day
(On my higher ground) For higher ground

I'm pressin' on, the upward way
Brand new heights I'm gaining, everyday
No higher place, that I really have found
(Lord plant my feet on) plant my feet on (On higher ground)

Forgetting what is (forgetting what) is already be (is already behind me)
Ohh-ohh, oh, whoa
(I'm moving forward)
Moving, y'all, yeah (for what's ahead)

(I'm pressing on)
I'm moving on (Ooh, whoa)
Can't nothin stop me now (Nothing's gonna stop me)
I'm pressing on (Ooh, ooh)
To higher ground (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Each step I take (Ohh, whoo) is a new dawning of (Yes, it is, y'all, yeah)
A brand new day (Yeah) for higher ground
The race is not given to the swift
Nor the battle to the strong
But instead (??? ???)
But we gotta stay strong and fight on
Sometimes you feel like your foot might slip
Cause it's too much goin' on
Just realize your goal is greater than your struggle
Just hold on and be strong

I'm moving on
(I'm moving on)
Can't nothin' stop me now
(Nothing, no-no-no)
I'm pressing on
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) To higher ground (Ooh, ah-yeah)
Each step I take (Oh, it's the dawning of a new day)
Is the new dawning of (A new day)
A brand new day (Yeah, yeah) for higher ground
I'm moving on, can't nothin stop me now
I'm pressing on to higher ground
Each step I take is a new dawning of
A brand new day for higher ground

Be strong, and fight on
But by all means, keep moving
I'm a witness (I'm a witness)
For Jesus (Nobody but Jesus)
When I was down, and no one was there
He picked me up (Oh), and he carried me
I'm a witness (I'm a witness)
For Jesus (Nobody but Jesus)
When I was down, and no one was there
He picked me up (Oh), and he carried me1Embed
