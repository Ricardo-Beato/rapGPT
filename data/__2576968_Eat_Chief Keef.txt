10 ContributorsEat Lyrics
Girl, all I eat is food, all I eat is shoes
All I eat is clothes, why I won't eat you
Baby, all I eat is money, don't like seafood
Eat the rims up on my truck, skrrt skrrt skrrt, doo doo doo
Shawty said she wanna fuck, I'm like, "Cool, that sound cool"
And you know I rollled up smoking on that superglue
Death Row just like Suge, got my dough and got my food
Throw your ass in the pool, have them bullets wet you up

Ayy, N.W.A just like Snoop, ayy
Eazy-E, bitch, I got them ice cubes, ayy
Ayy, you in my lane, then I move, ayy
Young Jeezy, bitch, I got that white goo, ayy
Wop shit, ridin' with a light girl, ayy
She got all type of color, hella light swirls
MC Lyte shit, I got freestyle girls
I'ma test you out, then you getting out, girl, ayy
Queen Latifah, I set it off
Menace II Society, I take the dome
The TEC is up and don't make me tick it off
And the MAC up on, you'll be eating macaroni, ayy

Girl, all I eat is food, all I eat is shoes
All I eat is clothes, why I won't eat you
Baby, all I eat is money, don't like seafood
Eat the rims up on my truck, skrrt skrrt skrrt, doo doo doo
Shawty said she wanna fuck, I'm like, "Cool, that sound cool"
And you know I rollled up smoking on that superglue
Death Row just like Suge, got my dough and got my food
Throw your ass in the pool, have them bullets wet you up
You might also like
I got heart like I'm Kevin, and I'm gamblin', Ocean's Eleven, ayy
Who the fuck pissed up on my jewelry? I hope not R. Kelly
Pulled up, they like who the fuck with them Looney Tunes, I hope not Nelly, ayy
What the fuck leather is you wearing, I hope it's not Pelle, ayy
I paid four thousand for this leather, they hope it's not selling
Remember posted on the block, what was I? A young felon
Dropped out of school, I was livin' with my grandma, she didn't never wanna let me get nothin'
And then what? I had every fuckin' robber at grandma's
I got a phone call, then who pulled up on me? Mike Epps
Then my grandma took the motherfucking glass off Mike Epps
She met a lot of stars, seen me drivin' a lot of them cars
Then I asked her, did she want one? She said, "Oh, hell no"

Girl, all I eat is food, all I eat is shoes
All I eat is clothes, why I won't eat you
Baby, all I eat is money, don't like seafood
Eat the rims up on my truck, skrrt skrrt skrrt, doo doo doo
Shawty said she wanna fuck, I'm like, "Cool, that sound cool"
And you know I rollled up smoking on that superglue
Death Row just like Suge, got my dough and got my food
Throw your ass in the pool, have them bullets wet you upEmbed
