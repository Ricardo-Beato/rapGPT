I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas

These niggas monkeys, need be in a circus
These niggas jealous, these niggas worthless
You Mr. Never Get No Pussy, you a virgin
I'm Mr. Hit Her And Her Friend, I'm Mr. Perfect
I'm not from Earth, I'm not an earthling
I try to hit a lick with your friend that nigga nervous
He blew the lick we down to have six hundred thirty
Laws on my dick one of your boy I woulda murked him
I'm a baller and my birthday
It's every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Thursday
If it's a Gucci Mane show them bitches come in early
I'm polo down looking like Huxtable Lane nerdy
You might also like
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas

I'm killin' these hoes
I ain't out to impress nobody but my P.O
I like my bitches rollin', I like my weed rolled
And I got deep pockets and she got a deep throat
We watch out for police that be in street clothes
You niggas washed up like some fuckin' clean clothes
My bitch shootin' at you while I re-load
Sometimes I feel possessed, hope I don't get repo'd
Lil Tunechi in this bitch I'm with Gucci in this bitch
Uzi extra clips skateboard kick flip
Runnin circles around these niggas til they dizzy
I fuck a bitch to that Drizzy, eat that pussy if it's pretty
Runnin circles around em, three sixty
Tunechi!
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas

I'm runnin' circles, I'm smokin' purple
Cause Im a boss and you a worker
You got suspenders on like Steve Urkel
And if you run up on me, I'll murk ya
Yeah Ill hurt ya, yeah l dirt ya
Don't mention your boys, 'cause they'll desert you
Say she a dime, but she ain't worth it
Two six, not even a burglar
But she's a burglar, went from a fat girl
I got the scrap, you better act girl
Just like you know me, they call me Gucci (They call me Guwop)
I ball like Kobe, you know I'm shootin'

I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas4Embed
