Aw, yeah, everybody killer
Tryna make it to the top, we can't take everybody with us
We can't get everybody rich, we can't fuck everybody bitches
I'm afraid to catch a case, I feel like everybody snitching
Cold sweats and the shivers, I be having premonitions
Growin' up, ain't had no lights unless it said to check the engine
'Less we had to spark the wick, show somebody that we miss 'em
I would park a nigga shit, streets got dark and niggas quit, huh
Tell me where you from, I ain't heard of that
In the city, baby, your first rap can be a murder rap
I will let you hold it but you gotta bring my burner back
One up in the top, I get the drop, you know I'm surfin' that
Send 'em up to Heaven gates, now his mama sellin' plates
Now his homies washin' cars 'cause he out here actin' hard
Please don't try to get involved 'less you wanna prove it
'Cause my gangsters really movin', hold on cuh, them niggas shootin', waitYou might also like2Embed
