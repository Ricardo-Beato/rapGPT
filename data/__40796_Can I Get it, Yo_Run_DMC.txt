Can I get this?

And when I come you're lookin dumb
You say who did this (DID THIS) did this (DID THIS)
Face you're lookin dumb on, hum could you HUM ON
Beats are droppin now and what and why and when and how
Drop it come on, come on, I got some on, my TIP
Get me up and goin for the vickie vickie VICK
Beefin through your teeth and what you see is what you GET
Suckers what you lack is what you lickie lickie LICK

So come on, come on, got you swingin on my BO
Suckers seek my facial but you see I lay you LOW

I'm gettin stupid, you wonder why I'm ill?
Cause I've been around, and still got these skills

Still the King of Rock, ho around the tick-tock
Rappers sweatin Joseph Simmons, ever since I dropped _Rock Box_
Multiplatinum, waxin em while I'm maxin em
"Who's House?" God's House, so chill while I'm taxin em

Rappers poppin mad smack, about the King of Rap
Ten million sold, SEVEN DIGIT CONTRACT

JMJ, gettin busy on the crossfader
Beats hardcore, diesel like the Schwarzeneggar
 Respect the black crown
 Sounds underground
 Any stage they built
 Run tore it down!
