Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba (Ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba (Yeah)

I been tryna drink less
But I feel like when I drink, I'm at my best
Not a care in the world, no stress
Always give the world my everything and no less
I wake up seven days a week and get the job done
You know I'm always there for my wife and my son
And at the end of the day, I love to pour one
More like two, but occasionally three and it scares me
Not because I have a problem
I'm the type of person, if there's an issue, then I'ma solvе 'em
It's more like seeing how this shit has dеstroyed life
Uh, I look at my mom, I look at my dad
And see how drugs and alcohol took away everything they had
And it makes me sad, I found the balance, but I feel bad
I didn't drink 'til I was twenty-seven, then I did from then
And every time I take a sip, I'm scared that I'll become them
We went to Alcoholics Anonymous mostly twice a week
I was just a little boy, but listened when people would speak
Prostitutes, preachers, substitute teachers
Cops and criminals, they all gave speeches
About this addiction and it filled me with conviction
Keep comin' back, boy, it works if you work it
And it did, growin' up, I was a AA kid
I never wanted to make the mistakes that they did
Yeah, sometimes when I sip, you know, I feel survivor's guilt
But I know that what I'm drinkin' could destroy all that I built
So I tread lightly, this shit leaves people dead nightly
Alcoholic, well, it's in my blood, so I might be
Drug addict, well, it's in my genes, so I might be
But I don't use that shit to escape
I deal with my problems head on 'til this day
Addiction to substance, it was my fate, but I broke the cycle

Lost on a lonely road
Carrying such a heavy load
Lost on a lonely road
Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba

Ayo, damn
Yo, can we roll the window down, please?
I can— I can barely see, the fuckin' weed smoke, yo
Logic, why are you scared of weed?
I ain't scared
Well, you obviously feel some type of way about it
No, I— I don't know why it's gotta be a big fuckin' deal, okay?
I just don't wanna do it
Man, just hit the blunt
No
Just hit the shit, man
Bro, I gotta be on stage in like fuckin' forty minutes
I'm not tryna perform in the tenth dimension
Havin' panic attacks and shit on stage, man, fuck all that
Bro, this weed ain't even that strong
You'll be fine in like thirty minutes
Lenny, don't hand him my shit
This from Cali, this that brain rape
What, what?
Yeah, that's what it's called
Fuck no
What?
Ain't no— nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Ain't— Ain't no way in hell, I'm smokin' some shit called brain rape, bruh
What the fuck is that?
Yo, Logic, just take a hit
Take a little baby hit
Man, why— why you guys always tryna peer pressure me, man?
It's not even like I'm—
Ayy, man (Ayy, bro, stop bein' a fuckin'— Come on, man, just— just hit the fuckin' weed, bro)
Alright, alright, alright, goddamn, fine, fuck, shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hit that shit, hit that shit2Embed
