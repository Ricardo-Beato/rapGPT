26 Contributors745 Lyrics
Real talk nigga
It's your boy Gucci
Ay
745 baby
745 nigga
For all my niggas out there handling their business
All my niggas handling their mothafuckin business
NY to A dog I'm in New York right now

Came out of
Came out of jail on a monday morning
Whole world watchin' like I was performing
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
6 months ago I was sitting my cell
Now I'm sittin in a new V12
Niggas always said that I wouldn't blow up
I touched rock bottom can't go but up
Left Big Cat and I signed Mac Breezy
Word on the street that I don't like Jeezy
But fuck that I'm tryna rape the budget
Beat the murder rap niggas change the subject
Jumpin' out the plane with the Louis V luggage
Yellow diamonds same color as mustard
Blue diamonds same color the tarheels
Red diamonds like the section where Game live
You might also like
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror

Niggas scared to sign me cause I beef too much
And they heard that I stay in the streets too much
Knee deep in the game
I'm ahead of my time
60 Gs I spent just for tellin' the time
I'm the hood homeboy
The ghetto trophy
Niggas hatin' on me so I can't stay focused
I smoke a nigga like a pack of them newports
Middle of the mall right in front of the food court
I might look gravy, but I'm smokin' that kushy
I'm not a killer, but you pussies done pushed me
I'm tryna live I ain't tryna die
So I'd rather your momma cry then my momma cry (bitch)
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror

Now what would you do if a nigga tried you?
And you chillin' with a bitch
And some niggas came through
Would you run like a chick or stand like a man?
Nigga tell me when you piss do you sit or do you stand?
See my momma bring the drama
My daddy tote a llama
I learned from my momma so I hit him with the thunder
I coulda been dead, but im still breathin'
Do I smell pussy? Naw that's Jeezy!
You ain't a snowman, you more like a snowflake
Cupcake cornflake, nigga you too fake
Beyoncé, oh thats your fiancé?
Jeezy is the appetizer, you'll be the entrée
2 Glocks shawty, ay let's party
I'm at the 40/40 lookin' for Sean Cartay (uh)
Man I love to beef
Couldn't wait to get home cause I love the streets
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
