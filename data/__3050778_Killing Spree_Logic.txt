110 ContributorsKilling Spree Lyrics
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like

Real shit goin' on in Lebanon
But I don’t give a fuck, my favorite show is coming on
Hashtag pray for this, pray for that
But you ain’t doing shit, get away from that
Blame it on a black, blame it on a white
Blame it on a gun, blame it on a Muslim
Everybody wanna blame him, blame her
Just blame it on a mothafucka killing everyone!
Everybody wanna get high
Everybody wanna live life like they can’t die
Everybody gotta be right
Everybody scrollin', scrollin' through they life
I wish they would love me like I like they pictures
I wish I had bitches
I wish I had motivation to get money
Ain’t it funny, my rainy day would be sunny
If I had the vision of currency fallin' above from the sky
Fallin' above from the sky, listen up
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody think that the meaning of life is, life is
Everybody, everybody, woo
Everybody think that the meaning of life is

Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like
Oh, I know it’s hard, I know it’s hard like
I know that’s the reason you turn up at night
Livin' yo' life, just livin' yo' life
Can’t nobody tell you how to do it right
Come away with me, come away with me
Let me take you from this world of insanity
Come away with me, come away with me
Far away from flying bullets on this killing spree
Oh, I know, I know
It’s hard, yeah, it’s hard, yeah, yeah
I know it’s hard sometimes
It’s hard sometimes
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like46Embed
