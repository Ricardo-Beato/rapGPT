We spendin' all this
Money, gettin' all this shine, hittin' all this
Cuddi, spendin' all this time, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for—
All this money, gettin' all this shine, and it's all so
Funny, 'cause it's all just mine, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life (Hey) for better or for worse

I'm lookin' out the window, the kid stayin' lit like a Zippo
You hatin', I don’t trip, bro, it's gravy, 'cause your bitch know
Cup of Henny, I sip slow, the spins, yo
Hit the stage to bust a rhyme, call me Flipmode
This, that, the other, I'ma make it happen
Travel all around the country in a station wagon
Take it back, you reminisce on all your favorite classics
My words play more than Mad Libs
I got plenty lyrics, they got plenty ad-libs
Warn the holy spirit, my father's on some rap shit
Listenin' to Tribe, gettin' high, puffin' lye
See some people ridin' by, come outside, say what up
I ain't nothin' like a star, I’m chillin', layin' back
Travel round the whole world, enjoyin' everywhere I'm at
Meetin' different people, eatin' different food
No one like a gourmet meal more than Q though
You might also like
We spendin' all this
Money, gettin' all this shine, hittin' all this
Cuddi, spendin' all this time, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for—
All this money, gettin' all this shine, and it's all so
Funny, 'cause it's all just mine, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for worse

They feelin' kinda jealous, everybody be thinkin’ that they was cool
Gettin' money since my mommy was droppin' me off at school
Now I got a whip to cruise in
You the Pirates so you losin’, I'm in the news, you let 'em bring your news in
I bowl strikes, you always leavin' a few pins
I do me, you keepin' up with them new trends
I got fam, you worried 'bout makin' new friends
I'm in my PJs, you had to wear your suit in
Thinkin' what I'll do? When? Where? How? Why me?
Relax myself, kick it like Tai Chi
You could find me, only where I’m at
There ain't no other me's, they be checkin' on my stats
High cat, find 'im up in a tree
Homie may be spittin' bars, he ain't fuckin with me
I'm just turnin' up the heat to a hunnid degrees
Spittin' like I got a razor blade stuck to my teeth, hey
We spendin' all this
Money, gettin' all this shine, hittin' all this
Cuddi, spendin' all this time, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for—
All this money, gettin' all this shine, and it's all so
Funny, 'cause it's all just mine, I'm
Feelin' better than ever before (Ever before)
This my life for better or for worse1Embed
