Yeah, I bend it down, I touch my toes
I do the splits, then fuck the floors
Suck your dick, then fuck some more
Get on top and ride it slow
Wanna stay on till I explode
Dynamite, time control
I make you take it back, Delorean
Then hold your breath and stretch it out, accordion
Spread my legs, lick my clit
So good, make you bite your lips
He on that Mike Tyson shit
This bitch not to be fucked with
And you better not cum quick (why?)
'Cause me and my girls love to suck dick
Brand new mattress, break the frame
Pussy so good make you say my name

She work the pole
(She a working girl, she work the pole)
She work the pole
(She a working girl, she work the pole)
She work the pole
(She a working girl, she work the pole)
She work the pole
(She break it down, she take it low)

Oooh, he can lick the clit
When I sit on it I'm riding it
Oooh, I'm riding it
Oooh, he wanna take me down
He wanna take me down, he wanna take me down
He wanna take me down
He can take me down, he can take me down
He can take me down
He wanna take me down, he wanna take me down
He wanna take me down
He can take me down, he can take me down
He can take me down
He eating it when I'm riding it, oooh

Let's get nasty, let's get nastyEmbed
