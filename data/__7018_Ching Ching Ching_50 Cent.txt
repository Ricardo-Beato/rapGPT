Yeah, yeah, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit (Yeah, nigga)
God's Plan (Haha), Yayo (Non-stop)

I hustled then I got that ching-ching-ching
Then I bought my bling-bling-bling
That's how I got your fuckin' bitch on my dick
I hustled then I got that ching-ching-ching
Then I bought that bling-bling-bling
That's how I got your fuckin' bitch on my dick

You can catch me run inside, nigga, doin' my thing
'Cause what I write with my pen got me next to Don King
I'm blowin' H2O in a H2
With a project chick named Rachel
I got rocks on my neck with a big-ass piece
And come through in a Lex with Claudette Ortiz
With no roof on the top, that's my Sunday car
In the Hummer lookin' hot, that's my Monday car
I got a stable of hoes, now I'm a P-I-M-P
And saw your bitches on a Amtrak with grams of D
We got beams on the gat, we detail our weapons
And the way that I rap, we e-mail assessors
Niggas hear what I spit and wonder how I write it
G-Unit gon' win, we on automatic pilot
You might also like
I hustled then I got that ching-ching-ching
Then I bought my bling-bling-bling
That's how I got your fuckin' bitch on my dick
I hustled then I got that ching-ching-ching
Then I bought that bling-bling-bling
That's how I got your fuckin' bitch on my dick

Ménage à trois, I got these dykes wet
Off of blue E pills with the knife checks
I'm still blowin green in the PJs
Laid out in the cut readin' screenplays, nigga be easy
Don't talk greasy, the rap game needs me
I'm spittin' sixteen, you gettin' charged, fuck a freebie
Y'all niggas in court spillin' the beans
About the kid from New York that be killin' the fiends
I'm a H-U-S-T-L-E-R, hustler
I got two maids, but fuck it, I need a butler

I hustled then I got that ching-ching-ching
Then I bought my bling-bling-bling
That's how I got your fuckin' bitch on my dick
I hustled then I got that ching-ching-ching
Then I bought that bling-bling-bling
That's how I got your fuckin' bitch on my dick
Bitch
