In the mirror, I'm doin' my dance (Like)
And he packin', I know by his pants (Grrah)
He a rapper but don't got a chance
Stuck in my ways so I'm lovin' my bands (Damn)
Like a million views in a day (Likе)

Bae, I'm not stayin', I just wanna play (Just wanna play)
In the party, he just wanna rump (Rump)
Big boobs and the butt stay plump (Stay plump)
She a baddie, she know she a ten (Baddie, ten)

No friends, I don't fuck with the fakes (Grrah)
Sayin' they love me but wantin' my place (Like)
Step in the party, I'm lookin' the baddest
