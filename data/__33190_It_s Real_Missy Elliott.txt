5 ContributorsItâ€™s Real Lyrics
Yeah, ohhh-ohh
Yeaahhh, yeaaa
I love you more then my mouth can say
I'll take a flight to kingston, anyplace
Just to be in yo face

From new york city to japan
I'll be there ba-by
Just call my phone and I'll come flying
On the next plane to you
Never worry cause I'm ya woman
And I promise ba-by
I promise you will be my man

Cause baby it's real (real)
So real (so real)
Can't you tell by the look in my face, yeah
Oh baby it's real (it's real)
So real (so real)
I hope your feeling the same
Cause baby it's real

I'll follow you right to the moon
It could happen yeah
Just so we can be close as cousins
With my heart out to you
I love you more then words can offer
Pay attention ba-by
I hope this never ends my lover
