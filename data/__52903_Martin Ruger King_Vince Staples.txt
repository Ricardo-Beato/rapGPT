8 ContributorsMartin Ruger King Lyrics
Doctors getting nervous
They running out of prescriptions
Mentally demented emotions are non-existent
Mother contemplating if this could've been prevented
Feeling like the blame for a child turnin' sadistic
Well, really?
You can blame it all on the Ritalin and Zoloft
That had me seeing Satan in my playpen
Family, I hate them
They prayers never did shit
Fuck is God supposed to understand
The pain he never had to deal with
Hell: he never been there
But forced me to live in
Don't ask me why I'm sinning
Cus I feel that nigga owe me one to tell the truth
Either be the victim or the first to shoot
Grab the Ruger and a clip or two
I want this ballad to be played at my funeral service
For a child, 17, whose brutally murdered
By himself, tortured for years
The one voice nobody ever wanted to hear
So, the ones inside of his head had to take control
God wouldn't take my soul, if that shit was free of charge
Satan neither, I need a breather from all this breathing
Grab a trigger and squeeze it
Martin Ruger King
