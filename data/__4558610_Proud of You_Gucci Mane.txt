27 ContributorsProud of You Lyrics
Wop
Burr, burr
Yeah
Woah, Kenny

Like a preschooler, in my garage playing switcharoo (Huh? What?)
I park the red one, put the yellow front of the blue (Yellow, yellow, yellow)
I had the county blues, now every day I'm counting the blues (Mwah)
No lean in Mountain Dews, Guwop, I'm so proud of you
Accountants count it, two stacks so tall, got a mountain view (Money)
My house so big, this bitch mistook it for the Fontainebleau (Huh?)
First time I copped the Deuce, said, "Guwop, I'm so proud of you" (Skrrt, skrrt)
Guwop still Trap God and they quote me more than Dr. Seuss (Wop)

I'm way richer than when I got out three years ago (I'm richer than y'all)
I freestyle, don't even write, don't even think no more (I ain't writin' down shit)
Put the lean down, I don't want it, I don't drink no more (Lean, lean)
You ain't my friend, you ain't my round, man, we can't link no more
(Fuck my opps)
Ran out of places to tattoo, can't get no ink no more (No)
Fresh off parole, and I can't go back to the clink no more (No)
I had the county blues, now every day, I'm countin' the blues (Mwah)
No lean in Mountain Dews, Guwop, I'm so proud of you (Wop)

New clothing line, call it Delantic (Delantic, it's new, it's new)
My pinky ring sunk the Titanic (That's true, that's true, brr)
She say I'm fine, she threw her panties (Wow)
The coldest nigga on the planet (Brr, it's Wop, cold)
Coupe dropped the top, I call her Janet (You dirty bitch)
Them boys fell off, it's like they vanished (Well damn, they broke)
Extendo tucked, this bitch gigantic (I up that shit)
I up the strap, them niggas panic (Wop)

I'm way richer than when I got out three years ago (I'm richer than y'all)
I freestyle, don't even write, don't even think no more (I ain't writin' down shit)
Put the lean down, I don't want it, I don't drink no more (Lean, lean)
You ain't my friend, you ain't my round, man, we can't link no more
(Fuck my opps)
Ran out of places to tattoo, can't get no ink no more (No)
Fresh off parole, and I can't go back to the clink no more (No)
I had the county blues, now every day, I'm countin' the blues (Mwah)
No lean in Mountain Dews, Guwop, I'm so proud of you (Wop)

Guwop, I'm so proud of you
No lean in Mountain Dews, Guwop, I'm so proud of you1Embed
