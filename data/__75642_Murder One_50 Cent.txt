19 ContributorsMurder One Lyrics

Ayo Fif, I was thinking
You should go back to doing the shit you used to do

Murder them, murder them, if I let them demonstrate I murder them
Niggas be fronting, word up it's stunting til they heard up
Their semi talk, I let that buck, I had these niggas running hard
I pull a nigga skirt up, and have him kicking dirt up
I get a nigga hit a nigga, back up stupid hard
Silence, it's the return of the tyrants
Seein' through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand close to the homie you wanna die with
Flames come out the muzzle on the shit that I spit
I'm talking like the feds ain't listening
Nigga this a pool of piranhas you fishing in
I get it nigga if you want it
Better ask niggas out me I be on it
I get the drop, blow at your knot, perfect planning
Hit your back with something hot, out the cannon

It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to back put the work in
It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to backroom workin'

You know I got the strap on me, bar holding that for me
I'm fucked up, it really doesn't matter though
100 9 millimeter shells in the Calico
Wait, niggas drop like domino
Run for your life puta, si, vamonos
I was taught to see my crew a long time ago
Walk around with cocaine, yeah even my mama know
I cut a O in the fo' with seven at a time
Made 4 hundred of that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cindy Lauper bitch, time after time
A nigga shine, like a nickel 9
I been talking to the man in the mirror
Nigga so ass, they be shaking like Shakira
It seems like my vision's getting clearer
See me coming with the hammer out, death is getting near you
It's funny how niggas never hear you
Till you run down on them, gun down on them

It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to back put the work in
It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to backroom workin'
Yeah, starting to feel like the old me2Embed
