6 ContributorsEvil Lyrics
I know you aim for me, I can see it in your eyes, if you say fuck, now
I wouldn’t even be surprised, everybody ain’t real, and I had to realize
That you hating ass niggers' are just the devil in disguise
I don’t see no evil, hear no evil, catch me riding solo
I got two Desert Eagle's, I don’t see no evil, hear no evil, catch me outside
And, I got two Desert Eagle's

Stevie J's face on you pussy niggers', I’m focused, grab my sledge hammer
About to crush of them all, they roaches
Had them niggers' hunt your ass down like poachers
Have them look for your ass in broad day, the vultures young
What, fuck with all the hate, that’s easy
I tell you pussy ass niggers' to your face, 'You can't beat me'
Real nigga all day, and everyday, that’s Jeezy
Got love for this hip hop shit, that’s me, me, nigga
But, I can feel the hate in the air, I smell it, fuck you mean
What, I know about hope, I sell it, tell God, 'Protect me
From these demon niggers', they evil'
Why you think the streets praying for you nigga, they need you

I know you aim for me,, I can see it in your eyes, if you say fuck, now
I wouldn’t even be surprised, everybody ain’t real, and I had to realize
That you hating ass niggers' are just the devil in disguise
I don’t see no evil, hear no evil, catch me riding solo
I got two Desert Eagle's, I don’t see no evil, hear no evil, catch me outside
And, I got two Desert Eagle's
You might also like
Niggers' want me over like movie credits, I know it, only real niggers' shit
You niggers' talking, I’m for it, nigga, long as I got air up in my lungs
I’m grinding, lord, how you came back to slay these niggers', good timing
Only thing different bout my watch, no diamonds
Grown man shit on you little niggers', still shining
Tell you one thing I learned about life, keep moving
Drunk a whole half a gallon last night, I’m ruined, niggers' worried about you
Ain’t worried about theirself, that’s backwards, man
Half these niggers' ain’t even theirself, they're actors, nigga
Everything I learned in the streets is with me
Niggers' don’t like the way a nigga eat, come and get me

I know you aim for me,, I can see it in your eyes, if you say fuck, now
I wouldn’t even be surprised, everybody ain’t real, and I had to realize
That you hating ass niggers' are just the devil in disguise
I don’t see no evil, hear no evil, catch me riding solo
I got two Desert Eagle's, I don’t see no evil, hear no evil, catch me outside
And, I got two Desert Eagle'sEmbed
