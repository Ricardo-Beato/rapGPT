Why your bitch walking like that? (Bang)
'Cause of sex, nigga (Bang bang)
Told your bitch I call her right back
'Cause I text nigga (I call her back)
Boy, you ain't no Wolverine
These Rugers Luther Lex, nigga (Luther Lex)
Put these TECs to your chest, nigga, flex, nigga (Flex, nigga, flex)
Pull up in that M thing, what's up with that, nigga? (Skrrt, skrrt, what's that?)

Pull up in that ADHD Down syndrome, my toolie spitting (toolie spittin', bang)
He truly blessed, I'm truly with it (truly with it)

The only thing I beef with is no pie (Is no motherfuckin' pie)
I'm counting money you ain't got no life (You ain't got no fuckin' life, Glo Gang)
You ain't got no green, you ain't got no rice (You ain't got no fuckin' rice, why bih?)
At my old hoe wedding, throwing money like it's rice (Throwing money like it's rice on Jay)
Got a Glock 40 on me, don't get light this pipe (Ayy, ayy)
Got a two million dollar meeting right now (Right motherfuckin' now)
I'm two hours late I was 'posed to be there at five (I was 'posed to be ready at five)

In the mall buying shit when I walk out I hear sirens (Ayy)
