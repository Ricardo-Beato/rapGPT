Bum, ba bum
This is gonna feel real good, a'ight?
Most Dope
Everybody please put a thumb in the air (Hey, hey)

One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)

I feel like a million bucks
But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground, I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout
Tryna get so much that I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night, Johnny Carson
I ain't got a Benz, no, just a Honda
But tryna get my money like an Anaconda
Real, real long, cross the country
Smoke joints in the whip, no cop can bust me
Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream
All them pretty little girls come and flock with me
Yeah, I rock the beat
You might also like
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)

And I like my rhymes witty, all my dimes pretty
If you got weed, you can come fly with me
I don't take pity on them silly little hoes
Milli Vanilli but this is really how it goes
Mouth my words, don't say shit
Shh, shut up, bitch, and ride this dick
I'm just playing, let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes and alcohol, hey
Don't forget it when I'm wreckin' the etiquette for the hell of it
Smellin' it when the L is lit, I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh, but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in
Finna have a party, baby, you can tell your friends
We the type, lookin' right, still settin' trends
Fuck a job, I'ma get these dead presidents
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)

Not a day, goes by when I ain't gettin' high
They wonder why don't I go get myself a job
So I can make, them bucks, but I don't give a fuck
No, I feel great
Bitch, I feel great

One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door, so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)34Embed
