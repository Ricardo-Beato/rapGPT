Let's go
I'm surrounded by some real niggas (Lil Top)
Hey (Yeah), yessir (They won't do it), Buddah Bless this beat

I said I need it
This Draco undefeated (Rrah)
Hit your block and then I bleed it (Yeah)
Go long, these bullets, he receive it
I can't see it (I can't)
My wrist look like a snow cone, make her eat it (Woah)
Once I see her, I give her that dope dick just like it's ether
Then I leave her, I can't get caught up, I can't be on Cheaters
There go them people, you know what it is
Go put the dope up 'fore they breach us
Before they breach us
I'ma get out this bitch and I'm strikin', I'm throwin' my heater
Whole lotta money, and still they keep comin'
Forever I'm livin' my life like a bleeder (Slime)

Dope boy (Dope)
I'm straight out the Nawf, I came up sellin' hard (Hard)
Heroin (Dawg)
I'm straight from the Nawf, I went, bought me a don (the Nawf)
I jumped off the porch and went bought me a gun
We boardin' the jet 'cause my dawg got a warrant
We don't give a fuck, bring the stick, where we goin'?
I'm booted up off that Molly, I cover my gun
This stick got a ELO, my aim on point (On point)
Shootin' that Glock give me pain in my joints (Pew-pew)
We shoot a fifty-round drum, honey bun (Bun)
I want two thousand, I want both of they tongues
I know how to handle it, bust on my damages
These niggas can't run, we gon' peel everyone
You know where I'm from, give a fuck how you come
Got a stick in the car and it sound like a bomb (Boom)
I came in this bitch with a mil' worth of cash (M)
Like Bandicoot, we 'bout to crash (Crash)
No remorse, I put five to your dash (Bitch)
Off the porch, bought a Porsche, then I drag
Off the building, them young niggas slide (Slide)
Put up 30, now you do the math (Fool)
If you seek on my son, I won't hide (I won't hide)
Bullets rain, we give him a bath
You might also like
I said I need it (Ha)
This Draco undefeated (Rrah)
Hit your block and then I bleed it (Yeah)
Go long, these bullets, he receive it
I can't see it (I can't)
My wrist look like a snow cone, make her eat it (Woah)
Once I see her, I give her that dope dick just like it's ether
Then I leave her, I can't get caught up, I can't be on Cheaters
There go them people, you know what it is
Go put the dope up 'fore they breach us
Before they breach us
I'ma get out this bitch and I'm strikin', I'm throwin' my heater
Whole lotta money, and still they keep comin'
Forever I'm livin' my life like a bleeder

From the bando to bandit, we makin' it happen
I like a bitch bougie but keep me a ratchet
Winning's fantastic, Cartiers straight out the plastic
Diamonds in all of my glasses (Chill)
I'm fuckin' more bitches than Magic
Straight out the basket, they say them young niggas havin' (Hey)
The money too old, it's growin' maggots, nasty
Finger-fuck it with the Magnum (MAG)
I'm thinkin' they forgot the way we paved
We been givin' too many niggas these passes (Too many)
Fuck it, drop a bag and cash it (Fuck it)
Who gonna press 'em the fastest? (Who?)
Extendo barrel elastic, new attachment, shit get tactic (Tactical)
They stole the flow (Go), now they tryna run off with the fashion
My neck, I freeze it (Ice), just give us the reason
Make that smoke look easy (Ooh-ooh, easy, woo)
Couple blue hunnids with the stones, it's bleedin' (Cash, bleedin')
What's your issue? (Woo) If you got a trigger, just squeeze it (Bah, squeeze it, bah, squeeze it)
Whole block outside, it's a street fest
Ain't no peace treaty (Nah)
These stones around my Jesus, they ain't treated (No)
They got me heated (Hot)
Don't play with the gang (Ooh-ooh), they know that we be undefeated
I get to squeezin' (I get to squeezin')
When we talkin' beef, they say that they vegan
Jumpin', no reason (Jumpin', no reason, woo)
We coppin' more ice and tuck in the freezer (Ice)
I said I need it
This Draco undefeated (Rrah)
Hit your block and then I bleed it (Yeah)
Go long, these bullets, he receive it (Oh-oh)
I can't see it (I can't)
My wrist look like a snow cone (Oh-oh), make her eat it
Once I see her, I give her that dope dick just like it's ether (Oh-oh)
Then I leave her, I can't get caught up, I can't be on Cheaters
There go them people (Them people), you know what it is
Go put the dope up 'fore they breach us
Before they breach us
I'ma get out this bitch and I'm strikin', I'm throwin' my heater
Whole lotta money, and still they keep comin'
Forever I'm livin' my life like a bleeder (Slime)27Embed
