3 ContributorsDirt Off Your Shoulder Lyrics
What up Red
I see ya
I know you see me

Now if you feel like he's a whimp mami, go cut your phone off
Pagers ain't shit too leave that shit at home and
Just hit the club get at me 
I'll help you get that dirt off your shoulder

She want a nigga with money, more money than she can handle

Now if you feel like he's a whimp mami, go cut your phone off
Pagers ain't shit too leave that shit at home and
Just hit the club get at me 
I'll help you get that dirt off your shoulder


Now if you feel like he's a whimp mami, go cut your phone off
Pagers ain't shit too leave that shit at home and
Just hit the club get at me 
I'll help you get that dirt off your shoulder
You might also like
Now me and momma got a lot in common
We both like Common, but we don't buy his albums
We both smoke and she drinkin' what I'm drinkin'
And I'm drinkin' what she drinkin' and she thinkin' what I'm thinkin'

Now if you feel like he's a whimp mami, go cut your phone off
Pagers ain't shit too leave that shit at home and
Just hit the club get at me 
I'll help you get that dirt off your shoulderEmbed
