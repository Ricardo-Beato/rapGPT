7 ContributorsMake You Lyrics
It's operation get rich, and I ain't buying bottles
I don't want no Bentley, I buy fifty Monte Carlo's
I'm in the trap from Monday to Sunday
And you don't want no problems unless you want gunplay
I wet your set with a tooly on it
I got a tech with a cool-it on it, I wet your deck, like,  done it
And if you pray, then it really haunts you
And No, I don't remember your name, I'm on my one million blunt
So call Tit for that yay game
Cause we real, they lame
We here, and they came
And now I'm old enough to know how balling feels
But all the ones that taught me 
So I'm so hungry I can eat a mansion
And I'm so broke I can't pay attention
So low, I don't need a bench
I don't need a tеam, so dope, I don't need a beam
It's Tity Boy, Lil Boo and Gucci Mane

Drop it off bеfore I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off

Come around my block, we'll show you how the king cook
Pussy niggas tryna stunt, get they fucking chains took
Chi-Town what we call it, full of killers and alcoholics
45. make them back up off me, don't try it, man, you salty
 heads get hit
They start calling feds and shit, we stand your clique
I'm good cause I have my bricks
I'm in my Jag smoking bags of that deadly shit
Hell yeah, I packed an extra clip, so don't slip
I'm right here, head on tilt
It's a shame all the cocaine I done dealt
Tity Boy, Gucci Mane, young Boo
Now where it poppin', niggas tell us what you gon do

Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
I'm a  rookie
Can't go out like no pussy
Can't let no nigga push me, I take a nigga cookies
I heard you got a truck with a hundred pounds in it
So I got my chopper with the hundred rounds in it
Damn that's some real talk, fuck what your clique thought
Throwing up them E's, like 
Why you weighting gains up? Damm you done came up
Military trained up, almost famous
Gucci got a sick flow, all he wear is Roles Gold
Tryna get a deal, but all I got was clothes though
Now I'm like a CEO, Imma sign my damn self
Nigga out of line, Imma beat him with a  belt
Burn him with a hot iron, fuck him with a broomstick
Go and dick his main bitch, for tryna talk shit
Gucci keep it gutter man, all I do is hustle man
I'm 'gon take your mama man, pistol whip your brother man

Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make it come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to come and take it offEmbed
