Mhm

I might need me some ventilation
A lil' vacation, Houstonfornication
Mind redefine new renovations
Space coupe back out of the space station
Float around town, do that on the daily

How I'm supposed to feel safe? 12 live adjacent (12)
Yeah, crib built like a prison where that bitch is gated (Yah)
Yeah, spendin' all my time up there gettin' faded (It's lit)
Yeah, handin' out the E! to the Entertainment (Alright)
Yeah, you know on this side it's poppin' and it's dangerous (Pop it, pop it)
Ridin' through the clouds, we goin' through the vapors (Phew, phew)
I'm just tryna get the paper, stayin' out the papers
It ain't easily done, it ain't easy (Yeah)
Pop a seal like it's Chris, make it look Breezy (It's lit)
Weddin' bands on my fist, shit is freezing (Straight up)
Throw the bands, get a kiss, then she leave me (Cash)
I just want the peace, it's still Lambo' over Mercedes, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
Just built the Astroworld playground to play with my baby, yeah (My baby)
Had a few pop singers, anyone could be your mama (Yeah)
Had some real conversations with my nigga Bill about Congress, yeah (Straight up)
We at the fest', come and link, per-request, yeah (Alright)
Send the pin, drop it in, GPS, yah (Yeah)
Seein' flashes, oh, no-nah, that's my neck, yah (It's lit)
I've been livin' paranoid, watch your step, uh (Yeah, yeah)

Ain't never freein' up and never let y'all, man
We always forgive, but don't forget easily (Oh, no)
Cut my phone off so they can never reach me
Life is just a maze, goin' through my phases (Yeah)

I might need me some ventilation
A lil' vacation, Houstonfornication
Mind redefine new renovations
Space coupe back out of the space station
If it rise on the East, land on the West
We gon' make that shit pop, bust it for a check
Call the plays, link the squad, we gon' make it cash (Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)

Yeah, nobody can press me but the press, uh
Nobody can check me when it's chess, uh (Ah, nah, for real)
They comin' at my neck like Gillette, uh (Gillette)
I'm hard to catch, that's the butterfly effect, yeah
I've been locked in for so long, I done got dreads, uh
Took the girl off the network then up the net, uh
Iced out watches for the gang, Patek the set
Had to move up off my block, it took finesse, yeah
Just keep droppin' them bombs, you should probably save your breath, yeah
We ain't gon' play the steel, why you tryna funk the flex? Yeah
All my dogs in my will, they gon' ride through to the death, yeah
Elevator up the hill, we ain't never take the steps, uh (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't never freein' up and never let y'all, man
We always forgive, but don't forget easily (Oh, no)
Cut my phone off so they can never reach me
Life is just a maze, goin' through my phases (Yeah)
