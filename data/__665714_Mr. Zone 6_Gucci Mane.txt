10 ContributorsMr. Zone 6 Lyrics
You can't insult me homie or try extort me homie
I'm holding court I'm think that I'm to good to torch ya homie
It's important buddy moving blocks of snort
I got bags of torch on my yard and porch
I'm in ya plasma figure, they catchin' asthma killa
I'm from the 6 but everyday live in Alaska nigga
It's a suggestion next Gucci so extra asprin
Crips so East Atlanta my chain a lantern
Now it's a lantern plantin' be like damn he handsome
From the barts to phantoms fuckin' dimes at random
Trap em down to tandum, they came for ransom
Diamond debts advance em' will change ya mansion

I'm so good at ballin

Money stupid tall and im running through the mall
And its every night a different girl im running through em all, man

Drinkin' liquor till they earl and they call me Zone 6
