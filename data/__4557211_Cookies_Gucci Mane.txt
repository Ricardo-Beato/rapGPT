Um, I'm Thugger
Okay, boo, hey

These bitches know not to try me like I'm the 
Can't show your sack, I'm  we in your bushes
Can't have my baby, I'm gon' watch you while you douche
I show my ass in the club, that's 
Okay, now shake it, baby, shake, shake it baby
I ordered 20,000 1's 'cause I love naked ladies
I put the spice in my shoes and you know they the latest
I put the check on his head, they ain't gon' see him later
 designer belts and all these bitches pulling on it
I take off running with the sack and leave you looking for me
I slide past you in that Jag', ridin' on , tinted tag
Leave his sack with a sack, red  then go to flag, ayy
Yeah, I got them bitches, they wanna suck dinnick
Young Thugger too frigid
 pay for my , you play and you get it
I fuck on her kidney
I fuck off that remy, I get it back 
Fuck 'em again and then that is my mission
Now, that is my mention, I forgot to mention

Got a couple hundred on my right wrist, you can't miss it
And I keep a couple  with me 'cause I'm purple sippin'

She rollin' up my Kush, we kickin' with Thugger Thugger
Can't forget DK and VIB
I got Teeno with me, so you know these bitches watching, ayy
Now, shawty, pour me up, sippin' on double cups
She rollin' up my Kush, we kickin' with Thugger Thugger
Can't forget DK and VIB
