Cheers (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Sippin' codeine like it's beer (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm in London, so I'm screaming, "Cheers" (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Man of the year, still got problems
Lookin' in the mirror, you look awful
Talkin' to myself, do it too often
JK, Juice WRLD, you're so awesome
Um, I'm running up funds
Bottle full of pills, let's have fun
No cheap thrills, only rich ones
Fire drills, hotter than the sun

My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years

Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know I'm here to save you, I know I'm here to save you
Let's raise our hands and sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped your breakthrough

They say life's a puzzle, well, I'ma piece it together
But from the way I'm movin', I'll probably be piecing forever
I date a bad bitch, she'll be over decent forever
Even with fake tits, these other hoes just decent forever
My lady said she saw a baddie in the hotel lobby
Well, love, let's fuck her together
We got the world to our backs, give a fuck, never have
Middle fingers up, we're screamin' "fuck 'em" forever

My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years

Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know I'm here to save you, I know I'm here to save you
Let's raise our hands and sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped your breakthrough75Embed
