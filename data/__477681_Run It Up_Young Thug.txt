Have you ever seen some VVS's
Have you ever felt like Houston Texas
Have you went off first impressions
Have you ever pulled up in there flexin'
Run it up nigga
If you ain't, run it up nigga
You got, run it up, nigga
You got one chance, run it up nigga
Run it up nigga

I'm gon' run it up nigga, I'm gon' stack my cash, ya bitch
Run it up now I'm not average
I got three stripes like a fucking Simons
You know I cock it, I bust it at everyone around me
Is dogs, no husky this Blood shit is real
I'm screaming free Bloody, not Gucci not Dolph
But you know I'm muddy, your boyfriend my buddy
I shoot at your hair now you got a mullet
No drankin' that Act' you niggas drink 'tussin
I leave out the club, I left that bitch flooded

Rain dance, rain dance, rain dance, rain dance
She want a lil' rain dance
She whispered in my ear and said "No flex"
And I whispered in her ear and said "Yeah, yeah"

Have you ever seen some VVS's
Have you ever felt like Houston Texas
Have you went off first impressions
Have you ever pulled up in there flexin'
Run it up nigga
If you ain't, run it up nigga
You got, run it up, nigga
You got one chance, run it up nigga
Run it up nigga

I'm a motherfucking stoner
Catch your bitch, you know Young Thug gon' bone her
All you niggas you know they gon' clone it
We don't got no one but yeah they want us
Woo, woo, woo, ya bitch
I'm Snoop, Peewee Longway, Uncle Luke
Redbone ridin' round with me, I call her soup
Gold chain on me like I cut it out a flute
I just juuged a 100 and I gave it to my homies
I can't cry, if it ain't with it, it ain't on me
60-inch plasmas on all my home man
I'm riding on that Campbell like Naomi

Have you ever seen some VVS's
Have you ever felt like Houston Texas
Have you went off first impressions
Have you ever pulled up in there flexin'
Run it up nigga
If you ain't, run it up nigga
You got, run it up, nigga
You got one chance, run it up nigga
Run it up nigga6Embed
