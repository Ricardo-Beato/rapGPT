2 ContributorsOne More Day Lyrics
It's just one more day
The lord has kept me (woah-woah-woah)
Oh, don't rush, keep the pace
I'm focused on my goal
I need to tell the story, yeah

Get together in a state to make me great
Even when I fell flat on my face
You gave me grace
Lord knows that, I haven't been an angel and I'm no saint
But I'll always take the time to give you face
For all you've done for me

One more day (one more day)
One more day (God)
God has given us (one more day)
One more day (one more day)
One more day (come on children)
One more day (God)
God has given us (one more day)
One more day (God)
God has given us (one more)
One more
You might also like
It's just one more day
That the lord has kept me (woah-oah-oah)
And I take this special moment (special moment)
To tell you about my life, the ups and downs
You don't know the half, it was almost a wrap for me

Get together in a state to make me great
Even when I fell flat on my face
You gave me grace
Lord knows that, I haven't been an angel and I'm no saint
But I'll always take the time to give you face
For all you've done for me

One more day (ooh-wee)
One more day (oh-a)
God has given us (one more day)
One more day (can you sing it again?)
One more day (oh-oh, one more)
One more day (God)
God has given us (has given us)
One more day (sing it again)
God has given us (one more)
One more (one more day)
He picked me up
And he turned me around
And he placed my feet
And I'm looking pretty good right now
First crackhead, that you ever did see

But listen, I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (it's gon' be alright)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (it's gon' be alright)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (it's gon' be alright)
With you by my side (you by my side)
We gonna win the fight (we gon' win the fight)
Oh, I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (it's gon' be alright)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (woah-woah-woah)
With you by my side (you by my side)
We gonna win the fight (we gon' win the fight)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (it's gon' be alright)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
It's gonna be alright (it's gon' be alright)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
I got a feeling (I got a feeling)
I got a feeling, feeling, yee, yeah
Oh-oh, yeahEmbed
