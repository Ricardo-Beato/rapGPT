140 ContributorsBully Lyrics
Yo, check it out
It's fucked up
'Cause I don't see either one of us budging

"I'm withholdi-in' my anger, though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist, that he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect"
That's what he says to himself, as he uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things
And he just can't see that he's maniacally depressed
And in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world, so he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins, 'til he hurls himself into a rage
And it's destroyin' him slowly, 'cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's actin' like a bully, so he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared
You might also like
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally

Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers there just are
They just keep houndin' at me now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
But his ass is such a puppet, Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string, and Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough and Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff, and puff, and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks, so you ain't takin' out shit,
And, dawg, you just did a song with Bobby Brown,
So now you try to pull the race card, and it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus the stylist you fucked, when you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch,
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
You must be takin' too much E
Now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we're so close
To pickin' up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J, Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard
And I'm not excludin' myself, 'cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it, when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men, we learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold, when someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck about Ja, like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feedin' him pills, so if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will, and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talkin' to you straight: if the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap, I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
Irvine, get your boy off of that E

Get at me, dawg
