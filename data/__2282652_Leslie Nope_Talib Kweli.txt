10 ContributorsLeslie Nope Lyrics
I don't fuck with these niggas, nope

Why all these lames wanna riff?
It's an ass-kickin' party and your name's on the list
She keep my name on her lips
Good year like my name on the blimp
I get insane off the rip
Flip, let the beef cook like the flame on the rib tip
Goin' out in a blaze with the biscuit
Got the streets hooked like the 'caine that you sniffin'
Why? Why would you ever go against it?
If I gave a fuck about you it'd be borderline offensive
It's senseless, stalkin' on my page and my mentions
Walkin' on eggs and you soundin' all defensive
Hear dogs hollerin'
That's your ego talkin' and you're listenin'
When it get to whisperin' them snakes start slitherin'
Rappin' how they're rich and all their jewelry is glistenin'
Your mortgage underwater like I walked in on a christenin'

That's why, I don't fuck with these niggas, nope
I don't fuck with these niggas, nope
You might also like
I'm smoother than a criminal
I never trust niggas with no books in the livin' room
When there's no electricity, what the fuck is digital?
Beyonc√© married Jigga but they think we all jiggaboos
Don't get confused by the lyric
Protector of my city, stand alone on the citadel
Wake up in the mornin', say a prayer cause I'm livin' well
Proof of a miracle, it's spiritual
These niggas go from robbin' punchlines, to bein punchlines
For lunchtime, you ain't got the heart when it's crunch time
Soldiers gettin' shot on the front line
Not really for a cause but for they brothers they lay their lives when it come time
Trust being brave is a challenge
If every soldier was brave, there'd be no word for valor
The nerve of these cowards, who are you, the herb of the hour?
I treat my girl like horiculture, I'm preservin' the flower

That's why, I don't fuck with these niggas, nope
I don't fuck with these niggas, nopeEmbed
