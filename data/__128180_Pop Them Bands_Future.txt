Everything black, I'm loc'ed out
Pull up to the club, then buy the whole bar
Keep it on my hip, can't keep in the car
Shinin' like a motherfucker, lookin' like a star
I pull in the VIP, bustin' down the 'gar
She just wanna fuck, 'cause she seen my car
You and her, menage a trois
Louis belt, she like that
Her and her friend, they're dykin'

Bitches, pause, and they, dance
Say whats up, with you? You see me? Oh yeah?
You wanna see some cash? I wanna see some ass (Ok)
So why you fuckin' playin'? (Ok)
I know you see these bands (Don't play)
And they're gon' throw it too (Say what?)
Cause them my fuckin' mans (They is)
See me, I'm throwin' hundreds (I'm throwin')
Just cause I fuckin' can (I can)
