Time flies by when you really gettin' money (Money)
Nigga tryna keep up with me, really gettin' funny (Get some)
Ex-con, drug don, certified junkie (Yeah)
Was a corner boy until I bought the whole company (Wop)
Flow so hot, made me put the bomb up (Hot, hot, hot)
'Rari so fast, 12 stuck his thumb up (Skrrt)
Broke bitch see me, probably thinkin' come up (Yeah)
Racks on a platter, watch them bitches go up (Go)

Penthouse, top floor, kingpin status
Igloo, eskimo, iceberg lettuce (Brr)
Niggas not sellin' so they gettin' more petty
But I'm countin' up a milli' while my neck gettin' tatted (Wop)
Every broke bitch got a rich man fetish (Heard)
Money ain't shit, let a broke trick tell it (True)
If the green right, then Gucci might chef it
Whale shark, white meat, rich man sell it
Ridin' in a Lamb' with a big ol' motor (Rah)
Keep a young nigga with a big ol' poker
CEO nigga, I don't see these jokers (Nah)
Keep a thick ho with a deep ol' throater (Muah)
Deep ol' pockets, I can Deebo the block
Her eyeballs locked on that million-dollar watch
Foot on they neck all mothafuckin' winter (Brrr)
Feelin' like Obama when I'm jumpin' out the Sprinter (Wop)
You might also like
Time flies by when you really gettin' money (Money)
Nigga tryna keep up with me, really gettin' funny (Get some)
Ex-con, drug don, certified junkie (Lean)
Was a corner boy until I bought the whole company (Damn)
Flow so hot, made me put the bomb up (Hot, hot, hot)
'Rari so fast, 12 stuck his thumb up (Skrrt)
Broke bitch see me, probably thinkin' come up (Yeah)
Racks on a platter, watch them bitches go up (Wop)Embed
