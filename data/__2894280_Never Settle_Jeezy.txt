15 ContributorsNever Settle Lyrics
I want it all, brand new socks and draws
And a bitch so bad you don't see all the flaws
A two door that go vrmm every time you hit the pedal
You want the same? Just don't never settle
I want it all, champagne like Niagra Falls
And a big boy grill, portraits of Pac on the walls
A two door that go vrmm every time you hit the pedal
Got two words for ya, never settle

I'ma leave the bars to Kendrick and Cole I speak that real life
I-75 with them O's know what that feel like
So how could you compare me to niggas? You can't be serious
Ain't the type to ask all the questions, you got me curious
Bout the only nigga in it this solid, bitch I'm a kilo
They like "who that you got there with you Young?" Oh that's just my ego
Back to the business at hand, I need a four way
And I don't give a fuck where it's at, I go to Norway
Tryna be the first to the spot just like Colombus
The residue done clogged up the sink, they called the plumbers
Let down the window, tossed out the phone, I heard static
It's time to get all them dirty clothes up out the attic
The more you niggas doubt the more ambitious I get
I'm going out like Tony, I'm busting, talking my shit
You can line my haters up, everyone of them motherfuckers
When I open up my eyes, I see none of them motherfuckers
You might also like
I want it all, brand new socks and draws
And a bitch so bad you don't see all the flaws
A two door that go vrmm every time you hit the pedal
You want the same? Just don't never settle
I want it all, champagne like Niagra Falls
And a big boy grill, portraits of Pac on the walls
A two door that go vrmm every time you hit the pedal
Got two words for ya, never settle

How you gon' stop some shit that's unstoppable?
Why you speaking logic to some niggas that ain't logical?
They know a room full of hatin' ass niggas ain't an obstacle
I see you got them VVS around you neck, look like a popsicle
I put on for my city before I even wrote the song
If I'm ever out the house with you, you know the rope was on
Picture worth 1000 words don't need to take it out the frame
But the nigga right beside you tryna take you out the game
Like oh, see me (?) with bosses and bad bitches
And I don't fuck with industry niggas, they ass kissers
I had a million niggas that told me I wouldn't make it
Then I sold a million records, the talent you can't fake it
Look, one time for that nine ho, two times for your grind though
They wanna see you lights dimmed, make sure that you shine though
That's why I sit back and just roll up the weed
Let's talk the bullshit that's just what a nigga need
I want it all, brand new socks and draws
And a bitch so bad you don't see all the flaws
A two door that go vrmm every time you hit the pedal
You want the same? Just don't never settle
I want it all, champagne like Niagra Falls
And a big boy grill, portraits of Pac on the walls
A two door that go vrmm every time you hit the pedal
Got two words for ya, never settle
I want it all, brand new socks and draws
And a bitch so bad you don't see all the flaws
A two door that go vrmm every time you hit the pedal
You want the same? Just don't never settle
I want it all, champagne like Niagra Falls
And a big boy grill, portraits of Pac on the walls
A two door that go vrmm every time you hit the pedal
Got two words for ya, never settle2Embed
