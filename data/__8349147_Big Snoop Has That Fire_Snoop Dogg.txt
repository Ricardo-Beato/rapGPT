1 ContributorBig Snoop Has That Fire Lyrics
Pound of the kush, whole thing rolled up
Indigo cup, you can smoke what you want
Live by the rules, only take two puffs
Got a pound from the plug, wasn't even enough
Main out front, catch me in the cut
Smokin' outside, rollin' weed in the club
Only smoke good, so it's me you can trust
Gotta know where it's from, good weed in the pumps

I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire
I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire
I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire
I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire, ayy

Big Cs up, bitch, roll the trees up
I be in the club, big chillin' with my feet up
They ain't smokin' like the OG
They be off that bammer, I be smokin' on that OG
No flex, 'cause the name weighs a ton
Hundred plus four, that's a hundred round drum
Boss up, get your weight up some
Tryna keep up, boy, I do this for fun
You might also like
Pound of the kush, whole thing rolled up
Indigo cup, you can smoke what you want
Live by the rules, only take two puffs
Got a pound from the plug, wasn't even enough
Main out front, catch me in the cut
Smokin' outside, rollin' weed in the club
Only smoke good, so it's me you can trust
Gotta know where it's from, good weed in the pumps

I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire
I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire
I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire
I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire, ayy

Big Snoop Dogg, know I'ma count it up
Big things smellin' good, tell me "Level up"
Feelin' good, C-Walkin' on Mars
Footwork clean, I be dancin' with the stars
Know the name where I'm from, that's the blueprint
Smoked all around the world, left the shoe print
Cotton candy, my weed is gold
Let me see how many blunts you can blow
Pound of the kush, whole thing rolled up
Indigo cup, you can smoke what you want
Live by the rules, only take two puffs
Got a pound from the plug, wasn't even enough
Main out front, catch me in the cut
Smokin' outside, rollin' weed in the club
Only smoke good, so it's me you can trust
Gotta know where it's from, good weed in the pumps

I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire
I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire
I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire
I said Big Snoop, Big Snoop
Big Snoop has got that fire, ayyEmbed
