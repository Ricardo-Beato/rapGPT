No, no, no
I been callin' on, callin' on you
No, no, no
Yeah
I been callin' on, callin' on you
Uh

Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody, they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before
That's why I asked you

How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah
That's why I asked you, how you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah, heh, uh

How you mean? How you mean? What you know about the team?
Man, these niggas need to stop it, they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl, you need to stop it, all that pride and self-esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby, she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know, I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next ting, YMCMB, ah
You might also like
Ooh, finally got you right here (Said I finally got my baby)
Tonight, I'll ease your mind (Tonight, I'll ease your mind)
That's why I'm callin' on you (Why I'm callin' on you)
And, ooh, oh
Soft, you're love's desire (Soft, you're love's desire)
It's hard to stay away (Stay away)
You keep me callin' on you (You keep me callin' on you)

How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah, heh

How you mean? How you mean? What you know about the team?
You just know what you get told, girl, I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gon' have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby, she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know, I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, like the new king with the crown
Bunch of Underground Kingz, thought you knew how we get down, huh?
Ooh, finally got you right here (Said I finally got my baby)
Tonight, I'll ease your mind (Tonight, I'll ease your mind)
That's why I'm callin' on you (Why I'm callin' on you)
And, ooh, oh
Soft, you're love's desire (Soft, you're love's desire)
It's hard to stay away (Stay away)
You keep me callin' on you (You keep me callin' on you)

How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy
How you mean? How you mean?
Thought you knew about the team, ayy, yeah

Ah, call on you
Just mail me my ring back
Oh, I wanna call on you, baby
Can't keep that shit
Oh, I wanna call on you, baby
She said I could call on you, baby (Hahaha)
Ayy
La, da, da, da, da, la, da, da, da, da, baby
