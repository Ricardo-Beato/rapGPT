79 ContributorsSit N’ Prey Lyrics
After that day my nigga
I remember when he came back to school 3 weeks after
Gave that nigga a bible
And I was like "Yo wherever you go, take this shit with you
You feel me, and you gon' be good
Like I can't, cause you my friend and I can't protect niggas"
Like all I can tell niggas is sit n' pray and that's it
But niggas be taking their life for granted like
You know being on some wild cowboy shit, you can't
You got beef with some nigga like, don't be in their vicinity my nigga…
I feel it
Soul music

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Tell me what the fuck an angel does
We're seeing kids who ain't aged enough
Getting high off angel dust
From NY to Los Angeles
There ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Looking where they car be at
And they party at
Cardiac arrest can feel risky
Real pissy I chase cheese and real pussy yeah
Cats used to yawn on his rap now look at 'em
Shit ain't been the same since them niggas started booking 'em
Pull up with your pen up, looking sharper than a bulletin
With pin stripes and hollow tip bullets in it
He's something that you'd invest in
Catch him live on late night, but he ain't interestin'
Pop up and poop out something like intestine
No corrections cause the mic been checked in
The only time he be asking is when he sexing
My team like teenage mutants and X-men
Fire spark when I step in
He the human torch
Inhaling fumes of all sorts of course
Steez taught me how to store it in my ball shorts
So when we stop by the D we never get caught
I say it again we face L's but never lost
Either be a warlord for 6 fees short
Each day in this living hell feel remorse
But he had a million dollar smile way before he flossed
You might also like
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Yo, I'm trying to Oprah win-win with a "L" in my hand
Remotely passed off like the generous man
And they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand
But don't understand they the only one who gets the benefit, damn
Sometimes I just sit and pray
They couldn't walk this way in my J's
It wouldn't feel despair, but disarray
Like their souls disappear
Son got hot flows, got dropped like disarray
Couldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed
Covered with Ray-Bans, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!
Even through shades of black
I see brighter days looking back in fact
So I relax my mind, see what these tracks can find
A gold mine that will make me rich in both dimes in mine
Gotta make it all mine if you don't mind
Cause sometimes
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Right on the block where they sit and play
Lives the vicious ways where they spit and spray
Vicious trey's coming for the ice you kept in yesterday
It's nothing but the history
Protecting ya' from being history
And then the next day your face is just a mystery
For niggas who really ain't feeling me are all my fucking enemies
Even the lightest hours requires heavy artillery
Accelerate without the breaks of a break
And still I'm not eating up to now and there's a lot on my plate
All in a day's work of God and his grace
You wanna eat then tell God and say grace
And avoid the heat getting the boil to surface
A soft nigga caught between these rocks and a hard place
Because the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface
But the ill-minded child, is ill minded child
Got a round of styles
Killing niggas' mental like a round of shells
Very well rounded, round it well 'til the highest number
Praying that 2047 ain't the highest number
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Get off my cheeks let me do my thing
Interrupt the wave length
Live and let live
And people talk smart got the balls to say
They apex and standing for this way
But got nothing to show or give
I ain't judging10Embed
