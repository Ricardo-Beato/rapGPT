1 ContributorStraight Ballin’ Lyrics
Oh, no
Welcome to tha Chuuch, Vol. 3 (Welcome to tha Chuuch)
Big Snoopy D-O-double-G
You know I had to do it to you
Take some of that 2Pac (Welcome to tha Chuuch)
Mix it with a little bit of D.P.G. (Welcome to tha Chuuch)
Keep it ridin' for the 2000 plus three (Volume three)
Told y'all I run the streets, homie, check this out

Now ever since a nigga was a G, playin' football
With the homies on the Westside, straight rollin'
Never really knew that I would come up in the game
'Til I put my foot down, look, man, now I'm ballin'
Everybody know my name, lil' mama love my game
Lil' kids think I need to be in a hall of fame (Haha)
Look, I'll get there, time prеvails
But if I don't, I'ma ride and slide, this Eastside
Thе coldest you know at this
I might as well take my time, have a go and try to flow at this
I gotta give a shoutout to the pro of this
And my homegirl Rage, man, you know I'm blowin' this
I'm 'bout to show these suckers how I do 'em up (Mmm)
You bubblegum rappers on the mic', I chew 'em up (Haha)
Let's get down to the game for a second
As I give these suckers a good mackin', packin', and check it, trip
You might also like
Live the life of a boss player, 'til the day I die
I'm drinkin' my drink, and smokin', la-la-la-la
All I really want is cash and things
But if the women come with it, I'ma work that thing (Thing)
Live the life of a boss player, 'til the day I die
I'm drinkin' my drink, and smokin', la-la-la-la
What you wanna do?
You wanna holler all day or you gon' step to Snoop?

Yeah, they say the streets is talkin'
Dogg, pay 'em no mind, man, keep the walkin'
Suckers is hawkin', my fans is stalkin'
I'm takin' flight on you suckers, like Connie Hawkins
Or Darryl Dawkins, call it chocolate thunder
It's like a juggle, sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep 'em goin' under as I say?
Paper, paper, I gotta get over

Live the life of a boss player, 'til the day I die
I'm drinkin' my drink, and smokin', la-la-la-la
All I really want is cash and things
But if the women come with it, I'ma work that thing (Thing)
Live the life of a boss player, 'til the day I die
I'm drinkin' my drink, and smokin', la-la-la-la
What you wanna do?
You wanna holler all day or you gon' step to Snoop?
Paper, paper, I gotta get over
A whole lot of money with a lil' bit of doja
Paper, paper, I gotta get over
A whole lot of money with a lil' bit of doja
Paper, paper, I gotta get over
A whole lot of money with a lil' bit of doja
Paper, paper, I gotta get over
A whole lot of money with a lil' bit of doja
Yeah, yeah
Welcome to tha Chuuch, Vol. 3
Big Snoop D-O-double-jizzle, for shizzle, dizzle
And I want y'all to be on the lookout for that 213 album
Comin' in stores soon
And that DPG
And anythin' connected to Doggystyle Records, man
For real, haha, good lookin' nephew, I'm gone
Told y'all niggas I run this shit, man
For real, bitchEmbed
