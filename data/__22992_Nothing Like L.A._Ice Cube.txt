20 ContributorsNothing Like L.A. Lyrics
I can show you the Palms, Mirage (yeah)
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M-I-A
(I'd like to dedicate this song right here)
I can show the waterfalls from Spain to Prague
(To my beautiful wife Kim)
To the beach in Saint-Tropez
(Who's been down with me since 1989)
I can show you the world, girl; the world, girl
(Through thick n' thin)
But ain't nothing else like L.A
(We done seen the world together)
I can show you the world girl the world girl
(And I'll love you forever)
But ain't nothing else like L.A
Nothing like L.A

When they come to L.A., they got the wrong impression
When they come to L.A., they gotta learn they lesson
When they come to the West Coast, it's such an obsession
When they played out, I'm just an exception
When it comes to you, girl, I need your affection
Every time you walk by, you get my inspection
All you gotta do now is make your selection
And it won't be hard to win this election
You might also like
I can show you the Palms, Mirage
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M-I-A
I can show the waterfalls from Spain to Prague
To the beach in  Saint-Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl
But ain't nothing else like L.A
I can show you the world girl the world girl
But ain't nothing else like L.A
Nothing like L.A

I done been around the world, I ain't impressed
I can't wait till we hit L-A-X
Tokyo is cool and yea I feel the UK
But can't nothing can fuck with Californ-i-a
Especially L.A. and I'm feeling The Bay
But nothing like rolling down PCH
Top down West bound it's all good
You don't go Hollywood when you from Hollywood
Let's go to the hood and fuck with the haters
Then to the Staples Center and hang with the Lakers
No. 6 is cool but no. 24 is the champ
And even D. Wade and Chris Bosh know that

I can show you the Palms, Mirage
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M-I-A
I can show the waterfalls from Spain to Prague
To the beach in  Saint-Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl
But ain't nothing else like L.A
I can show you the world girl the world girl
But ain't nothing else like L.A
Nothing like L.A
The BET Awards and even the Grammys
They always pick L.A. over Miami
I love Miami, I ain't dissin' Miami
But where would you rather get robbed for your Grammy?
Ain't nothing like Sunset Boulevard
Compton and Watts if you wanna be hard
We got it all, what you thought not at all
If you sicker than shit, then take a Tylenol
Itâ€™s just me and my woman versus all of y'all
And we taking a bow for our curtain call
The angels are lost, they don't wanna be found
If God is looking for them, I can show him around
