36 ContributorsPart of the Plan Lyrics
This a Burna production
Niggas don't want noâ€”
Niggas want no smoke
Niggas don't want no beef
Me and my brothers gon' ride
How many niggas gon' slide?
Ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Still a youngin', I run up them bands
Shit's all goin' exactly as planned
See the diamonds up on me, they dance
Walk around with that gun in my pants
No, my niggas ain't throwin' no hands
He said he was with it, he saw me and ran
Growin' up, I ain't know how to scam
So juggin' and robbin' got me in a jam
I got niggas locked up in the can
Most of them niggas that hate us, they fans
On my neck, that's a whole lotta grand
I soon go to Cali', can't wait 'til I land
On my mama, I want this shit bad
So I'm in the studio, gotta go ham
On my mama, I'm doin' the dash
I went through that once, I can't do it again
One, two, three, four, five
Dead niggas up in the sky
I be smokin' on deadies
Y'all niggas ain't ready for pressure, we finna apply
SB niggas never gon' lie
Niggas want clout, so I gotta move wise
AP is dancin', I call it my prize
Boy, if you wouldn't, stop tuckin' your pride
If you want it, I'm uppin' the nine
Fuck all this fame shit, I'm bustin' for mine
Tuckin' the trauma like nothin' aside
I'm from a jungle, it's hard to survive
What you jackin', you pickin' a side?
Bro said he lackin', I took him, a vibe
I'm pistol packin' to keep me alive
Heard nigga rattin', it fuck with my mind, damn
You might also like
How you my brother? You tellin' on niggas, I don't understand
I done did hard time for the gang, I'll do it again
I'm tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
But, nigga, I'm with it, don't ever forget it, ain't shakin' no hands

Too many snakes, gotta keep it low
Niggas gon' hate knowin' I'ma blow
I'm outta state, always on the road
Pick up the pace, you been movin' slow
Call up my hitters, they ready to slide, just gotta say, "Go"
Do it for Smelly, it's really his drive, forever my bro
Shit be too hot, I can't talk on the phone
Someone gon' die, better leave it alone
You said you with it, boy, fix up your tone
My thottie come run you, they bad to the bone
I fuck your thottie, I'm makin' her moan
I had to sober up, get in my zone
'Member I thought I would never come home
When I needed money, ain't ask for no loan
I had to get that shit all on my own
Ain't nobody care
They tried to give me the time like I'm grown
Won't nobody there, ain't tryna play fair
You finna get done, I'm just stoppin' and stare
I travel, don't care
Why you droppin' the addy? You not really there
How you my brother? You tellin' on niggas, I don't understand
I done did hard time for the gang, I'll do it again
I'm tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
But, nigga, I'm with it, don't ever forget it, ain't shakin' no hands
How you my brother? You tellin' on niggas, I don't understand
I done did hard time for the gang, I'll do it again
I'm tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
But, nigga, I'm with it, don't ever forget it, ain't shakin' no hands

Y'all niggas gon' say what y'all say
We gon' pull up, broad day, ain't nobody tryna play
Okay, 'cause you really wanna have it your way
Gun play, we gon' still get your ass some way
I won't let niggas fuck up my vibe
Niggas really be fakin', disguise
Music been on my mind since '09
Now it's 2021, I ain't wastin' no time
Same nigga, ain't a damn thing change
Programmed not to say no names
I don't drink but I pop champagne
It's for Smelly and E and the SB gang
Fuck boy, you ain't takin' no chain
Want clout, you ain't got no name
Thirty clip, let the whole thing bang
We some young, wild niggas that just can't be tamed
Red beam just to help my aim
Big chop, swear the five gon' rain
They gon' call me insane
Brody died and I still never dropped no names
Y'all niggas ain't got no pain
Funny shit, better watch your gang
Who'd've ever thought we'd rock Balmain?
Got a AP flooded, I ain't rockin' no jane
Rap money, flip it like cocaine
New expenses, I gotta maintain
Niggas felt like I ain't had no brain
'Til I got in the studio and everything changed
Quick blow, I 'on't gotta explain
I'm still tryna get used to this fame
Pussy boy must've thought it's a game
This life ain't for you, better stay in your lane
How you my brother? You tellin' on niggas, I don't understand
I done did hard time for the gang, I'll do it again
I'm tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
But, nigga, I'm with it, don't ever forget it, ain't shakin' no hands
How you my brother? You tellin' on niggas, I don't understand
I done did hard time for the gang, I'll do it again
I'm tryna focus on music so prison not part of the plan
But, nigga, I'm with it, don't ever forget it, ain't shakin' no hands4Embed
