27 ContributorsQueens Wolf Lyrics
At fourteen tried out for the ball team
Junior high, they denied me
I shot bricks that made the backboard scream
Fightin' Italian rival gangs, they was sniffin' glue
I was skippin' school, smokin' green, that was the shit to do
Stole somebody team jacket at practice, slept through my classes
The borough Queens, so it's rep the Q to the casket
Average student, had illusions of the supernatural
Horror movie addict, werewolf fanatic and Dracul'
One night after school and train hoppin' and snatchin' jewels
I dozed at midnight, woke up a little after two
My hands shook violently
My eyes took red
My hair spun in ways
Bread was the only word I said
I heard voices in the nights calling, the Benz engine roaring
Heard that gin and champagne pourin' and niggas ballin'
I put the .22 on my waist
The face in the moon had a mean look
I transformed to the Queens wolf

You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'
You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

Waking up is a pleasure though last night I can't remember
Cash up on my dresser, where'd it come from?
This is messed up
What kind of fatal drug am I taking? who laced it?
Previous night, memories who erased it?
Wasn't even wasted
I do recall the nightfall, lunar, the stars around it
Then my man called, said what I did, the goons were talkin' 'bout it
Singin' me praises, said I lit the corners up
It sounded like Vietnam screamin' out "QBietnam" the loudest
"Homie them dudes is scared you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing
They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team"
So that explain the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer
That wasn't there a day before, I should press 'em all
But I be on some cool shit, nigga, my QU shit
Audemars watch, burn a peach Swish', new whip
Stoli' vodka, club soda with my new chick
Ah shit, teeth showing, snarling when the moon's lit

You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'
You could hear me growlin' through public housin'
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bussin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'3Embed
