They gave lil' Trotty 25 for them thangs, nigga
They walk up on you, give it to your friends, nigga
They walk up on you, give it to you, see your friends, nigga
(Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro)
We've been at the laundromat all day
We've been washin' money all day
I heard the police lookin' for me, 'cause I got the hood hot
We've been at the laundromat all day
We've been washin' money all day
I heard the police lookin' for me, 'cause I got the hood hot

It got blood on that money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up

28 grams, I serve it on the porch
I just seent them narcs, they ran off in my house
The homicide unit comin' to the house
My cousin murked a nigga and he just got out
I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up some drank, say "Fuck my problems"
My hood, they treat me, like I'm El Chapo
I keep that dog food, like I'm Ralo
I had the warrant in Clayco and beat the case
Man, I'm fresh as hell, bitch, Easter day
All my ghetto tactics, I'm above average
I've been so in tune, man, I've been so ambitious
Grab another Fanta, let me fill it up
If they ain't make the channel, you ain't built like us
The Federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
I feel I'm walkin' through Hell
I swear to God I'll never tell
They try to give a nigga the chair
I tell my mama, "Wish me well"

They got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
They got girl on the money and I still count it
They got boy on the money, watch my nigga count it

I know the devil is real, I know the devil is real
I take a dose of them pills, and I get real low in the field
I'll fly to LA today, and I live so high in the Hills
I share the mansion with goonies, I shared the bitch with a goonie
I took the mack in Bal Harbor, niggas ain't slippin', we got 'em
I took the pack out to Paris, me and that money got married
Me and the molly got married
Devoted in everything, my niggas mean everything (Zaytoven)
We're 5 deep inside a Chevy
Yeah, we tryna get it
Ask me, do I know how to whip it
Yeah, fuck the witness

It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up
She put me off and it was ugly
I made a million dollars, say she love me
The way she did me, it destroyed me
I kept it real with lil' shorty
I've been goin' bar for bar, these niggas know what's poppin' with me
I can go from car to car, these bitches quarter million at least
Two thousand for the shoes, I keep some shit on my feet
I'm probally in the mood to fuck your bitch on the beach
I dropped out of school and I get money like Meech
Send a junkie, send a driver just to get somethin' to eat
You see how things change?
I came from cocaine

It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up

I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up a drink, say, "Fuck my problems"
The federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
I heard the police lookin' for me, 'cause I got the hood hot
Heard the police lookin' for me, 'cause I got the hood
They got girls on the money and I still count it
They got boy on the money, watch my nigga count it21Embed
