77 ContributorsRadio Song Lyrics
This is anti-clean rap, nigga, where the green at?
Risks I take, you'd swear I had the balls the size of beanbags
Not what you're used to, bitch, I rep the Bruiser
And the label Fools Gold, jeans with medusas
Bitches wanna scoop us, get pussy like loofahs
Y'all niggas losers, cop clothes from them boosters
Hoes wanna choose up, of course they gon' choose us
So though you need a stylist, also you need a tutor
These stupid-ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas, guess what that makes you?
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fail
'Cause they don't care about music, just first-week sales

So they say you need a hit, a chart-topping single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash club banger, play it all night long
You never get on without a radio song
So this my radio song
This my radio song

She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thing on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'ma make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk
Until it's skeet-skeet on the walls and her shirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, 'cause bitch, I ain't tricking
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch, I ain't Puffy
Ice cream paint job, semi with the hemi
Heavy-duty Chevy, not a Bimmer, Benz or Bentley
There's no originality, carbon-copy singles
He made "Black and Yellow"? I'ma make "Black and Emo"
That's why these wack rappers, they never last long
Don't care about music, just radio songs
You might also like
So they say you need a hit, a chart-topping single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash club banger, play it all night long
You never get on without a radio song
So this my radio song
This my radio song6Embed
