62 ContributorsEscape 120 Lyrics
Yeah, 120
Whatâ€™s the word word word
Let's get it

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

I could never forget them gloomy days
Although I regret where my time was placed
If I could go back, some things would be changed
And I would know that, for a fact, it was fame
That drew me to this unfamiliar side of my brain
That withdrew me from familiar and the closest remains
Although I'm gaining ends now, I'm losing friends
They say that time is money, and my time is well spent
Girlfriend hit me up to chill, but does this shit make sense?
And I don't expect for you to know if you ain't paying rent
I got to make this album, and hold it down for my camp
Surrounded us all like bonfire
When I lay a verse down that's more fire, I was born fire, uhh
You might also like
And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

Went outside this morning, morning, uh
Seen the sky was falling, falling, yeah
Old man no longer snoring, snoring, ah
The rain just won't stop pouring, pouring, uh
What's heaven's capitol like, like, li-like?
Maybe I can crash tonight, night, night
Cause I'm trapped inside this hell, hell, hole
God, please answer your cell, cell, phone
I'm coming home tonight, can't touch no microphone tonight
Outside my comfort zone tonight
My brain's blown out my dome tonight
Tonight's the night, don't you try to put up a fight
Don't you trying looking for light
Cause I'm bout to take that flight

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away
Indigo father, meant to go farther
And travel across the water and pocket a million dollars
I am the spirit, I am the guava
You sippin' out of your coconut beverage in the Bahamas
Pardon me mother, pardon me father
I'm glad that you split apart it was part of my firestarter
Along with niggas, bitches, and ballers
And people that look down on me like they so taller
I go harder, I grow smarter
The flow's water, like Osama
Oughta gropple every dollar, every single piece of change
Move into the woods so I'll never ever change
Lose a couple friends but I'll never ever change
I probably miss some money but I never ever change
And they can say whatever but I never ever change
I feel I understood why the stars went insane
Ummmm brain battered from scattering every Saturday
Pitter patter with people that really matter
And I'mma fuck up regardless cause I'm a kid right?
That's why you can't spell summer without trouble
Stripper with no bubble, threesome with no double
Love without hate, life without pain
This without that, choice without thought
A dog with no day, a Seattle without rain
If it rains in Seattle
I'll saddle up and then you can ride with ya nigga
Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga
Vibe with me nigga, say vibe with me nigga
Say, if it rains in Seattle
I'll take you 'round the world on a Sunday
With me, one day, one day now
One day now, one day, one day
If it rains in Seattle
I'll saddle up and then you can ride with ya nigga
Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga
Vibe with me nigga, say vibe with me nigga
Say, if it rains in Seattle
I'll take you 'round the world on a Sunday
With me, one day, one day now
One day now, one day, one day28Embed
