It's 7 in the morning, I'm still up
I ain't gotta wait 'til I get up
I been in this shit since a pup
Only one's I trust is just us
Please do not fuck with me, cuz
You gon' be the victim, I'm the suspect
Shawty say, on me, she got a crush
She ain't even got her ass crushed yet

How much cock would your main bitch suck if the bitch sucked cock? (How much?)
How many miles can we hit with 300 shots? (How many?)
While a dark skin bitch from Kingston, callin' me a bumboclaat (Bumboclaat)
Nah this ain't my Uber, but she want this juggernaut (Want this juggernaut)
I'm a wide receiver I'ma go long (Go long, ayy)
Just hopped out in a no-go zone (In a no-go zone, ayy)
Just left my car in a tow zone (In a tow zone, ayy)
She like it rough she wanna get choked on (She wanna get choked on, ayy)
Gotta take my son on the jet with me (On the jet with me, gang)
Don't bounce by the man he upset with me (He upset with me, damn)
Bitch just texted me sayin' "you ain't that busy" (You ain't that busy, ayy)
Told the bitch God came down and sat with me (Came down and sat with me, bang)

It's 7 in the morning, I'm still up
I ain't gotta wait 'til I get up
I been in this shit since a pup
Only one's I trust is just us
Please do not fuck with me, cuz
You gon' be the victim, I'm the suspect
Shawty say, on me, she got a crush
She ain't even got her ass crushed yet

I've never bought me a lion (Lion)
Who sellin' one? I'm buyin' (Buyin')
My bitch here, stay lyin' (Lyin')
I don't lie bitch I get money (Money)
I'm feeling like Kid Cudi (Cudi)
Days 'N' Nites is nutty (Nutty)
No Keef ain't gon' sweat it (Sweat it)
I'm just gon' get it (Get it)
Got a new dog, gon' pet it (Pet it)
You don't like me, gon' said it (Said it)
Sosa baby is you leanin'? (Leanin')
Bitch, you should mind your business (Business)
Take magazines lil' nigga (Lil' nigga)
All I gotta do is flip it (Flip it)
She's sent my ass a DM (DM)
Like all we gotta do is kick it (Kick it)
I'm a minimalist to this blueprint (Blueprint)
But did I have to mention (Mention)
Chasin' after this chicken (Chicken)
I'm still waitin' to get sentenced (Sentenced)

It's 7 in the morning, I'm still up
I ain't gotta wait 'til I get up
I been in this shit since a pup
Only one's I trust is just us
Please do not fuck with me, cuz
You gon' be the victim, I'm the suspect
Shawty say, on me, she got a crush
She ain't even got her ass crushed yet2Embed
