69 ContributorsDon’t Be Afraid to Be Different Lyrics
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah

Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all

West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I... **** all that
Came in the game on my neon fresh
Won the first rap Grammy so I guess I'm blessed
Come off tours, walk on sets
Everybody followin' the trends I set
60 million sold, doin' it different
And my IG poppin' from doing it different
Bad vibrations, I stay distant
RattPack, MSFTS, doin' it different
Fortnite doin' the Carlton dance
Come on, it's just different, man
You might also like
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all

Used to be that motherfucker in the background
Yeah, but now I'm in the forefront
'Cause I keep it more blunt, goddamn
Pump up the jam, pump up the volume
I'm not Rakim, but I'm doper than—
Pump up, pump up the jam, pump up the volume
I'm not Rakim, but I'm doper than Valium
Back in high school, I was not the man
Now wherever I go they know who I am
From Maryland to Beijing, I'm raging
Paging the doctor on call, the illest of them all

Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
This is for the people goin' hard in the gym
This is for the people goin' hard on the dance floor
Pump up the heart rate and dance more
Pump up the, pump up the motherfuckin' jam
Rhymin' like Dr. Seuss, bitch I'm Sam I Am
I don't give a damn 'bout lyrics
You should feel the spirit when you hear it
No fuckboys, a legend can't get near it
Sucka em—sucka emcees they, sucka emcees, they fear it

Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all
Don't be afraid to be different
Don't be afraid to be different, y'all5Embed
