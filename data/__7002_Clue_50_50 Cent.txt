12 ContributorsClue/50 Lyrics
Yeah nigga
Yeah, we gonna smoke this motherfucker right here, right
We gon' smoke this shit
And then I'ma drink a lot a water
And I'ma take Golden Seal, so my PO don't find out I'm smoking this shit, aight?

Yo, niggas wouldn't rob Frankie if they had the chance
Wasn't cause of him—it was cause of his man Lance
Frankie cut crack (Woo), Lance hold the Mac (Yeah)
If fiends fuck with Frankie's packs, Lance cut the crackheads
He popped up, thought he was locked up
Came thru stuntin' wit his wrist all rocked up
Shoulda seen him smile, missin' the tooth
Coupe missin the roof
He like "What up, 50?" I'm like, "What up with you?"
Lance had a reputation that was well earned
Heard he taught niggas how them shells burn
Out there in Redfern
At the dice game, he rolled a headcrack in a crack
I'm like "Nah, I ain't paying for that! Nigga, shoot it back"
Niggas lookin at me like I'm crazy, they shook
I don't give a fuck who he shot out in Red Hook
Asked about Bone—yeah, Bizzy was my man
'Tilhe beat me for ten grand and sold my Mac for seven grand (Fuckin' crazy)
His man was thirsty, I could tell by his look
Cause he looked the way I look when I look for a juks, bitch
Motherfucker
Teamwork, work hard nigga

Lloyd Banks
Tony Yayo, nigga
