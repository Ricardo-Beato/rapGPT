Yeah

We are born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
Born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
I got the rage pushing through my veins, listen to me
No one's home, no one's home
I can't cope, empty on hope
No one's home, no one's home
My head has been screaming, I'm stuck with these idiots
Got this rage running through my veins, listen to me

Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yao, yao, yo

Undoubtedly, no saving me
Undoubtedly, no saving me
I've gotta bleed, no saving me
I've gotta bleed, no saving me
No saving me

A warrior hurt, a warrior's pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
A warrior cursed, a warrior's pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
I got the rage running through my veins (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
No one's home, no one's home
Won't leave a note, won't leave hope
No one's home, no one's home
Oh what a nightmare, I'm done with these idiots
Got the rage pushing through my veins, listen to me

Born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
Nobody's home, nobody's home
That was a warning, don't be an idiot
I will fucking bash in your brain
Listen to me, feel the blood boil in my veins
Alright, na, na, na, na, na, na, na4Embed
