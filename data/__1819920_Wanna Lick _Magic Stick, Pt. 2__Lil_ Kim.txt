5 ContributorsWanna Lick (Magic Stick, Pt. 2) Lyrics
You know you want me you probably wanna kiss this (Bo!)
Act like it's Christmas and put me on your wish list (Bo!)
When it go down I'm a help you grow your whiskers (Bo!)
Put your lips on my lips and taste my honey (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
You know you want me you probably wanna lick this (Bo!)
Girl I'm a treat everyday you can't get this (Bo!)
I'm busy man I be handlin' my business (Bo!)
But we can get our freak on, on some quick shit (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)

Tonight's the night shorty you'll never forget this
I dim the lights, I get it right, I'm like a pimp sick
Down on the bed, I make the clothes disappear quick
I see through her sheer La Perla pretty clear kid
I'm turned on now I really wanna hit, kiss
Her neck and nibble 'til I'm way down on her waist kid
Man she's a freak, I'm a freak I be freakin' off
When she come in with a friends, I'm like "Take it off!"
I got a fetish for the cheddar, yeah I'm rich bitch
That don't mean I'm runnin' 'round buyin' chicks shit
You see the chrome doubt be shinin' on my new six
My pinky ring, my neck, my ears and my wrist lit
I like the ice I'm pretty nice on the dice trips
Twice in a row you know, I got to get the dough
My confidence is high, I know I could hit a lick
My cheese pretty good, I know I could get the bitch
You might also like
You know you want me you probably wanna kiss this (Bo!)
Act like it's Christmas and put me on your wish list (Bo!)
When it go down I'm a help you grow your whiskers (Bo!)
Put your lips on my lips and taste my honey (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
You know you want me you probably wanna lick this (Bo!)
Girl I'm a treat everyday you can't get this (Bo!)
I'm busy man I be handlin' my business (Bo!)
But we can get our freak on, on some quick shit (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)

I'll be your wife, I'll be your girl, I'll be your mistress
But if you ain't spendin' that dough your gettin' dismissed
That means you gotta keep me laced like a seamstress
You can't expect nothin' less from the Queen Bitch
My doggy style make you wanna jump on that (Bo!)
Just like a dog on that chase for the kitty kat (Bo!)
Man he's a freak, I'm a freak I be freakin' off (Bo!)
He pour the honey on me, and then he clean me off (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
I take his breath away, Kim leave 'em speechless
I'm so wet, I'll have a nigga feelin' sea sick
He in the streets all day but it's alright
'Cause he'll be back tonight, and then the next night
And then the next night, because the sex tight
I'll be his Advil, I gotta keep his head right
He outta town and he fiendin' for me every night
He's so addicted sendin' for me on the next flight
You know you want me you probably wanna kiss this (Bo!)
Act like it's Christmas and put me on your wish list (Bo!)
When it go down I'm a help you grow your whiskers (Bo!)
Put your lips on my lips and taste my honey (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
You know you want me you probably wanna lick this (Bo!)
Girl I'm a treat everyday you can't get this (Bo!)
I'm busy man I be handlin' my business (Bo!)
But we can get our freak on, on some quick shit (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
You know you want me you probably wanna kiss this (Bo!)
Act like it's Christmas and put me on your wish list (Bo!)
When it go down I'm a help you grow your whiskers (Bo!)
Put your lips on my lips and taste my honey (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
You know you want me you probably wanna lick this (Bo!)
Girl I'm a treat everyday you can't get this (Bo!)
I'm busy man I be handlin' my business (Bo!)
But we can get our freak on, on some quick shit (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)Embed
