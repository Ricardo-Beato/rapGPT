95 ContributorsDaytona 500 Lyrics
We are the G-O-D's
And we came to rock the spot like Iron Man Starks
They be the illest emcees in the world today
Cappa, Raekwon and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
'Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez
"From where we at to my man's cell
From where we at—"
Say peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges
Street astrologists, light up the mic, God — acknowledge this
Fly joints that carry two points, Corolla Motorola holder
Play it, God, E-pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Repel all fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate, take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait, drop it like Dre
Thugs they be booin' and screwin', we canoein'
Claim they doin' the same shit we doin' — fuck the union!
It's the same style, RZA train, aboard, jump the turnstile
On the Isle, he tried to challenge God for the new Bal's
Especially that, aluminum bat in the Ac'
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day — it pays, black!
The MAC-10 flex, wipe cats like Windex
Index finger be sore bustin' these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily, grands revive lands
Layin' with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losin' 'em, jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem
Abusin' 'em, rockin' his jewels like we usin' 'em
Low-pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older God, build with the Sun, Moon and Star
You might also like
All you's MC's start realizin'
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibin'
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak, you better step behind us
"Ghost Face — Ghosface Killah!""

Mercury raps is roughed, then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wallys that match, bend my baseball hat
Doin' forever shit like pissin' out the window on turnpikes
Robbin' niggas for leathers, high swipin' on dirt bikes
Voice be mellow like Vaughn Harper, Radio Barber
Murder sleep-away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist who burn with his pen regardless
Slayin' all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Philippines, pick herbal beans, bubblin' strings
Biochemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Blonde heads, inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zoom in like binoculars — the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex was rockless, Chef ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man, no die-cast metal, I'm steel-alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen, both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers in hundred watt boxes
Yo, jostlin' these cats while Little J be deli'in'
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians
"Rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell"
All you's MC's start realizin'
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibin'
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak, you better step behind us
"Cappa-Cappa-Cappa-Cappachino"

Give me the fifty thou', small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills, my beer spills
What up, Lils? Murder one, dun
Killer bee stung, guess who back home, son?
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, Papi wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, Lorna Doones in fat pussy wounds
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill, check out the mad skills
Top-secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it
Jiggy style of rap and watchin' knock our slang, sweep it
Out-of-order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten, Donna, too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is Hancocked
'96, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot!
All you's MC's start realizin'
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibin'
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak, you better step behind us6Embed
