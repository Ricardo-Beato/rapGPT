Bad Boy, baby
Yeah, yeah
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah
B.I.G. 2000, B.I.G. 2000, Born Again
Yeah

The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke — gunsmoke! Gunsmoke!
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
"Hail Mary, full of grace..." — smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag, and the North Face off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money? Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, capisce-ah? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fists like Cu-macho
I got so much style, I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up", niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor, and me hittin' the clits!
Suckin' on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin' Around and Jumpin' Around
Jacked her, then I asked her, "Who's the man?"
She said, "B-I-G", then I bust in her E-Y-E

Yo, Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
Yo, Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on? (Junior MAFIA, Bad Boy)
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on? (Who got it goin' on?)
You're dead wrong
Yo, Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on? (Who got it goin' on?)
You're dead wrong

When I get dusted, I like to spread the blunt like mustard
Trust it! My hardcore rain leaves ya rusted
Move over, Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, uh!
Leave you toothless, you'll kibitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G's
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies — no ifs, ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Found your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feeling it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon got the little hookers screamin' (Woo!)
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
Yo, Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
(This 2000, Bad Boy forever, baby)
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on? (Who got it goin' on?)
You're dead wrong
Yo, Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
(Ladies and gentlemen...)

There's several different levels to Devil worshipin'
Horses' heads, human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals, havin' sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit
I just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin' meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket — I'm lyin', I got a .9 in my pocket
And, baby, I'm just dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My Uzi's heavy as yours
Yeah, you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I'll lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third, then she's dead on the fourth!
I'm dead wrong!
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
Yo, Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on? (Junior MAFIA, Bad Boy)
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong (Uh-huh)
Who got it goin' on? (Born Again, yeah)
You're dead wrong
Yo, Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong (C'mon)
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong (C'mon)
Yo, Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong (*repeat to fade*)

We won't stop, 'cause we can't stop
