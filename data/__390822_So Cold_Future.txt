16 ContributorsSo Cold Lyrics
When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so cold

Walk like a ball player, talk like a migo
Watch worth a bale and my neck on a kilo
Guacamole stuffed in the TRUs you can see notes
Long wave racks on that alley where I trick her
Strong in my system I can barely even see ya
Young fly mamasita slice it like pizza
Heard she was a diva and i did her with my people
Didn't your wifey tell you how we fucked and had a threesome?
Didn't your wifey tell you how the ice shine brightly?
Didn't she tell you 'bout the Audemar or the Breitling?
She told me how the diamonds had her dripping wet excited
Smashed her in the studio and kicked her out politely

When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so cold
You might also like
Yeah, I don't gliss, I shimmer got them hoes in a Venom
Finna fuck 'em 'til I can't remember could of been January, May, June or December
A1 Freeband gang, nigga I'm a member
Get money in the fall, spring, summer and the winter
Been around the world on a gangster adventure
California so loud you can smell the picture
VVS's on meth, you can see the crystals, my neck in a blizzard

When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so cold

Military training got my Gucci army hat on
Gucci belt holding up the TRUs that I have on
Gwualla in my pocket poking out like Offset
Fuck my bitch friend have my old girl upset
Old school Corvette '65 pace car
Money going round and round fast like NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt sponsored by the bud
Ice light up cause I'm sponsored by the drugs
La familia nigga I'll explain later
100 thousand on the whip and I didn't have to save up
Movie star, rock star, cocaina flavour
I love the money so much it's hard for me to cake up
When I reach inside my TRUs I pull out a big bank roll
As I scroll down my contacts I got over hundred some hoes
I'm on that strong Cali pack so it look like my eyes closed
And the ice around my neck will make a nigga heart so coldEmbed
