15 ContributorsPrimetime Lyrics
I'm as rude as I wanna be
Dog ass nigga take a thot on a shoppin' spree
Dog ass nigga tell a bitch what she wanna hear (ugh)
Dog ass nigga VVS diamonds crystal clear (uh-ooh, splash)

Fuckin' with the gang we knockin' off your nose
Halftime gotta call the play and it's give and go, rock and roll
Had the same gang since the rocky road
Halftime, go Deion Sanders like it's prime-time

Primetime, line it up, knock it down
22, 63, nigga got the recipe
Fuckin' on lil' shawty, bust it open, she all on her knees
Lean all in her ovaries, she just wanna ride for me (ride, ride)
Ride it like an uber, please
Divin' in like scubas be
Shawty wet like melted cheese (ooh, uh, Lil Boat)
Richer than the average B
Nigga wanna fuck with me, he wanna test my accuracy
They gon' let out shots for Lil Boat like its July 4th
Money sit tall like a dwarf
Drive that coupe all on the course  (skrr-skr-skrt)
Drive that coupe all on the course
"Can I fuck?"
She like, "Of Course"
On the jet like I'm air force
Niggas pocket-watching, pocket-watch me you gon' be upset
Look at how I flood my neck, diamonds invisible set, eww

I'm as rude as I wanna be (Lil Boat!)
Dog ass nigga take a thot on a shoppin' spree (yeah, yeah)
Dog ass nigga tell a bitch what she wanna hear
(what she wanna hear)
Dog ass nigga VVS diamonds crystal clear (crystal clear)
Bling-blaow!

Fuckin' with the gang we knockin' off your nose (hoo!)
Halftime gotta call the play and it's give and go (ho!), rock and roll
Had the same gang since the rocky road (okay)
Halftime, go Deion Sanders like it's prime-time
(Sosa baby, GBE baby)

Touchdown in my Cam Newton
Then I found my baby, damn I never knew
Ayy, they want to get down with the movement (yeah)
Tote that shit, you better do it (yeah)
Dug a hole then fell into it (bang-bang)
Ayy (bang-bang), hopped in the Benz, put the pedal to it (to it)
Take your neck with the metal to it (yeah)
Took the Ms then I avenue'd it
I just took your bitch out the katanas (yeah-yah)
Got her in my room and she went bananas (huh-uh)
I got a lot of sense and a little manners (yeah)
We'll get money you'll get tra-
Pullin off in that 33, 911, an emergency (dope)
Someone come get me, I'm in the field like Hercules (ooh-oh)
I don't play no two sides, I ain't with none of that perpetry (uh-ah)
She can get real burgundy but the currency is an urgency-y-y-y-y
(Bang!)
I'm as rude as I wanna be (Lil Boat!)
Dog ass nigga take a thot on a shoppin' spree (yeah, yeah)
Dog ass nigga tell a bitch what she wanna hear
(what she wanna hear)
Dog ass nigga VVS diamonds crystal clear (crystal clear)
Bling-blaow!

Fuckin' with the gang we knockin' off your nose
Halftime gotta call the play and it's give and go, rock and roll
Had the same gang since the rocky road
Halftime, go Deion Sanders like it's prime-time

Yeah, bitch, yeah5Embed
