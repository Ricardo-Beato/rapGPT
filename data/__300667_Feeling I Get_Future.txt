This for my fans
From Atlanta to Japan
Ayy, the feeling I get, the feeling I get

You make me feel like the world feel bout a billion dollars
You make me feel like my life ain't got no problems
You make me feel like all if my dreams will come true
That's why I do the things that I do
The feeling I get from you
The feeling i get from you
The feeling i get from you

Charisma, demeanor my lean go my to my vocab
Scribbing till you fuck with me like moses
Vvs unloaded
These diamonds don't mean a thing to me
In my song I don't repeat
I been fucked up inside the streets
I gotta think outside the street
I go hard for my niggas
Pray to God for my niggas
You part of me nigga
When I'm standin front the center
Screaming every verse
If you leaning of the syrup
Or are you drinkin cold water
You drink the cold water
I fuck wit you regardless
We know I feel 
We gotta feel important
I go the hardest
Pull lines off my song when I swear this shit will make you go the hardest
You might also like
You make me feel like the world feel bout a billion dollars
You make me feel like my life ain't got no problems
You make me feel like all if my dreams will come true
That's why I do the things that I do
The feeling I get from you
The feeling i get from you
The feeling i get from you(2581510)

Ayyy when I'm standing on stage
And my song gettin played
Every mention that I get I truly appreciate that chance
I will take your words for granted cherish every single moment
You down on my song and play it every single morning
Hey girl I wish I could hug you for the rest of my life
I'm gonna remember your face for the rest of my life
Now I know bosses that solute me when the see me
The recognize the real man that's foe my cousin Keke
The feeling that I get when you f*ck with me I'm G-Key
I go to L.A. Come back write a hundred songs
I freestyle off the top my head like I ain't got no arms
I'm a writer,know the song like I ain't wrote no songs

You make me feel like the world feel bout a billion dollars
You make me feel like my life ain't got no problems
You make me feel like all if my dreams will come true
That's why I do the things that I do
The feeling I get from you
The feeling i get from you
The feeling i get from you(2581510)
There ain't better feelin when you tremendously spend it
My lil kids whatever they want I go get it
Sacrificing quality time take em out to every single.moment every second of the day I see your face and paper chase it
Every second any day i f*ck with you the strong way
Chi town M town cashville dtake
Solute to you Solute the troops
St. Louis tell me what would I do without you
You notice me like Chuck off of (?)
You f*ck with me on the west coast
Just like Esco
True life my n*gga for real L E S O
Rapping and trapping we ain't never played the radio

You make me feel like the world feel bout a billion dollars
You make me feel like my life ain't got no problems
You make me feel like all if my dreams will come true
That's why I do the things that I do
The feeling I get from you
