25 ContributorsSex In Crazy Places Lyrics
I wanna do you at yo momma house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom of the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I can’t get enough of that thing

(Yo, yo)
Let's do up in Disney at the Magic Kingdom
You can tug on my Giuseppes and my Bagley Mischkas
I'm a ba ba ba, I'm a bag of fun
I'm a pro with them balls like And 1
Now lets go, Mexico that's where we next to go
Do him like his momma, make him eat his vegetables
Could call me a stage mom, boy you best to blow
Or you could even call me Wanda cause I'm "ret ta go"
You know I'm spoiled little daddy, stomps the floor
We could do it on Fifth Ave in the Department store
We could do it in Tokyo, we do it in Taiwan
All my Harajuku girls say I am they icon

I wanna do you at yo momma house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom of the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I can’t get enough of that thing, girl
You might also like
Say we could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)
We could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)

Don't compare me to your ex-man, baby, he a local Joker
I'll take you to Six Flags and drill you on the roller coaster
Call your girlfriends over, we can have a sleepover
Buy your ass a Jeep so I can fuck you in your Range Rover
Pictures in the nude, on the cruise, we gonna make the news
Sex great, sex tape, ready for a YouTube
Damn, it turn me on, we do it in your momma home
Father long gone, but Gucci be your daddy, baby
I can fly you anywhere, we can sex in crazy places
Airports, train stations, going up the escalator
At the Dome, on the 50, I'mma throw it, you da center
When you hike it, I'mma spike it
Girl, don't act like you don't like it

I wanna do you at yo momma house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom of the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I can’t get enough of that thing, girl
Say we could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)
We could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)

How bad you wanna do me on a scale of one to ten?
You like the way I bend, now you asking where I've been
If I'm doing him, now you starting that again?
I don't wanna sex your friend, he don't got enough to lend
Plus he was doing Lynn and she ain't nothing like amazing
Her stuff run deep and he don't have a occupation
I'm known across the nation, Trina's that chick
Bow-legs, red bone, long hair, real thick
Do me at my mama house? Nah, I don't think so
I got too much class, but you can try San Pedro
I need the biggest mansion, ocean backyard
With the newest Maybach and inside a black card

Tonight, I'll touch you in ya favorite spot (oh yeah)
Promise to get ya body so hot (we could do it anywhere)
So baby, don't be scared, if they see us baby I don't care
We could do it in the Gucci store
Close down the mall girl you just don't know
In front of the police, in front of yo daddy, girl it's you and me
And I don't give a damn that's why they call me Bobby V
I wanna do you at yo momma house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom on the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I can’t get enough of that thing, girl

Say we could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)
We could do it anywhere (Crazy places)
I wanna freak you anywhere (Crazy)6Embed
