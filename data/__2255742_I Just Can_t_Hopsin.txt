28 ContributorsI Just Canâ€™t Lyrics
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit
(Pound Syndrome)

Fuckin' with me, then it can get (ugly)
Stuffin' your corpse in a mattress (lovely)
Then I'll invite your girlfriend over
For a sleepover on it, nigga, that's (disgusting)
She can gag this (dumpling)
Ho, do not stop till my shaft's (erupting)
You should've known what the fuck I was tryna do
I did not call your ass over for nothing
How do I feel? Here's a riddle, son
Cut all my fingers off except the middle ones (what?)
Now, bend your ass over and sit on one (what?)
A.K.A. I've lost it, nigga, run (woo)
Whole world gettin' so sick of em
My nuts swing like a pendulum
I'm on Instagram right now postin' pics of 'em
They are so cute together, aren't they? Look at them (aw)
One's bigger than the other though
Just thought I'd let you motherfuckers know
I'm posted in a bungalow, gettin' deepthroat from a juggalo
Please do not get your face paint on my stomach, ho
Where the real MCs? There are no more
Swag ship took sail and they all on board
Holla at me when you wanna learn the art of war
A carnivore, flexing hard like I'm Arnold Schwarz
I'm explicit business, witness sickness
Spit from the lips of mischief
Talk shit, get hit, I can split your wig
With a knife into your dome with my fist to clinch it (that's murder, homie)
Oh shit, oh my, hit a nigga like I'm Kimbo Slice
And spend your life, so bitch, don't try
I throw you out a fuckin window, bye
And film it on Vine to get more likes (well, alright)
Soon as that cyclone hits
You know I'm back on that psycho shit
I got psychosis
My brain's filled with deadly microchips
I'm plotting your death with crayons and hieroglyphs
(You crazy, nigga!) Ha, I know this
In the club too turnt, tryna fight your bitch
Swing at me, nigga, I won't flinch
Can't you see my fucking mind's on Grinch?
I love violence
You might also like
I'm like damn, shit
Fuck, nigga, shit
I just can't deal with these niggas no more, man
Yeah, yeah, nigga
I just can't deal with these niggas no more, man
Yeah, yeah, nigga
I just can't deal with these niggas no more

Put a nigga in that stove (like roast)
I know you phoned 5-0, I'm ghost
Straight through the exit
Fuck a ho and use the same condom on the next bitch
Nasty-ass nigga having sex with a dead chick
Film it with the GoPro, slow-mo, and upload it to Netflix
Uh, excuse me, I hate to bother
Do you know where I can find a little Asian parlor?
Where they'll play with my balls like a game of soccer
And fuck me, too, for like eighty dollars?
I need my dick scrubbed and bathed in water
I hold the bitch down to play some doctor
If I ask her for it, it's gon' make it awkward
If I tip her well, she'll give brains and swallow (oh, yeah)
I'm a nutcase with ADD
Who rapes these beats, don't try cause you can't be me
Ya'll can't be pleased, stop hatin' on my angry steez
It makes me cheese, I barely know my ABC's
But still I'm on and I made like (two million bucks)
Oh, look at y'all niggas now (you give a fuck)
Shit, askin' to be on my team
Tryna take my goddamn cream, 'cause you niggas stuck
Same niggas always name droppin'
Like, "Aye, Hopsin, I rap too, I'm tryna get paid off it
Dre heard my shit and said it was great
I'll probably get signed to Eminem any day
And next week, Snoop Dogg, he gon' get me blazed
One time, I opened up a concert for MGK
My big partner, lil cousin, man, he friends with Drake
And Big Boy up at Power said he'll get me play
I had a video on Worldstar, dawg, believe it
I don't know what happened but it got deleted"
Man, if you don't get your ass out of my God damn face talkin' that bullshit, nigga!
Stop it with the lies, dude, I'ma just remind you
I hate phony niggas, I will not pretend to like you
Thirsty ass niggas love talkin' when I slide through
Fuck you, nigga, you ain't hoppin' into my crew
Damn, shit
Fuck, nigga
I just can't deal with these niggas no more, man
Yeah, yeah, nigga
I just can't deal with these niggas no more, man
Yeah, yeah
I just can't deal with these niggas no more
Fuck, shit
Man, I just can't deal with these niggas no more, man
Fuck, shit, damn
I just can't deal with these niggas no more8Embed
