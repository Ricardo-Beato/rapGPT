90 ContributorsSunrise Lyrics
Yeah, nigga, it's me again
I'm still around, I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room, like, all the time
"Gambino Girl forever" on that bracelet that she bought online
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, "Hasta luego"
'Cause I'm takin' all your city like I'm Carmen Sandiego
I am smokin', I'm on fire
I am blazin', don't get hurt
To my white dudes, it's a concert
To my black nerds, this is church
From that NYU dorm to the Emory
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip-hop than you'll ever be
I'm bustin', bustin', bustin', I'm bustin' on these niggas, man
And nothin', nothin' nothin', n-nothin' is the same again
You lookin' dumb as hell, man, for ever sleepin' on him
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin' on him
Will he fail? Now, that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, ha

(Ayy) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
(Ayy) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
You might also like
New shit, you didn't know?
Black rock like a fuckin' Lost episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly Rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt, that's that 20/20 hindsight
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson: 5 mics
Donald Glover, no relation
Always workin', no vacation
They couldn't feel me, novocaine-tion
Murder verses, the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom, I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me, that's somethin' that's so unusual
I've seen the future, and the future go, ah

(Ayy) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
(Ayy) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
New shit
(Woo!)
Can't you hear me, baby?
Can't you hear me callin' out your name?
Can't you hear me, baby?
Oh, can't you hear me callin' out your name?37Embed
