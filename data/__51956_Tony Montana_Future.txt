Fuckin' cockroaches
Muthafuckin' Freebandz
Want me to be the bad guy?
Wanna fuckin' play?
Ya know?
Come on!
It's the Cartel, nigga!

Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ends
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me where you wanna meet, I'm comin' with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud, I'm laced up to the fuckin' fo'
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, droppin' all cash (Woah)
Gutter to the death of me, I'm stickin' to the recipe
Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused
You might also like
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana (Who you)

On the hood you see the Stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggas gettin' nervous, I'm passin' out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin' up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin'?
Used to stay up at The Twelve, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy, you did it, boy, you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fuckin' women that knew Biggie, so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I'm Tony in my city, huh

Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Another shot of Quelo, she'll be comin' back to pesos
When you're plugged in with Pedro, it's hard for hoes to let go
See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga, I'll split your tato
Ain't nothin' about me ordinary, I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss, it's gon' take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin' with me, you'll move to Alaska by the mornin'
You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, it's on then
Champagne spillin', crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin', she say I ain't playin' fair
I'm about to cop a tiger, and put it in the car seat
Freebandz a company, so, nigga, it don't matter, ayy14Embed
