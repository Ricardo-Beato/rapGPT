Geahhhh! Yeahhhh!
Yeah! (Big Cat Records)
Zay-T on the track
Gucci Mane, LaFlare
So Icey E-N-T, ha
So Icey man, they say you're a stupid boy
Stupid jewelry stupid guaps
Man guacamole's on deck

See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl, it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl, I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl, it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity

Seventy on my Jakey baby, color karat bracelet baby
Why not spend about 20 g's, Gucci drop 380 baby
Multi-color clarity, necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club then come back with another chain
Mighty mouse is icey dog, Bart Simpson is just stoopid
Yellow, blue, black, green and white, the diamonds match the groupies
Digitally enhance the stones, pink is like a movie
Truly I'm a walkin lick, Gucci man the talkin brick
If you ain't gon' talk no chickens dog, who you talkin to?
7:30 in the kitchen, Nate Nate 'bout to go to school (Nate Nate)
Saturday I'm cookin chickens, momma about to go to work
Sunday Gucci cookin chickens, granny about to go to church
You might also like
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl, it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl, I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl, it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity

Heavy wrist activity, got me livin lovely
Cocaina heavily cocaina shawty
Breakin down ten chickens dog, 'bout to cook the shake up
All these extra grams, might as well go buy a Jacob
Gucci Mane for mayor, Gucci Mane so player
Reppin East Atlanta that's ten minutes from Decatur
I must match our cars and our vests gon' match our gators
You can't swang like Gucci cause you don't got enough flavor
Heavy on the licorice, dentistry ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent, I'm not very articulate
Gucci what the penalty? Shawty what the business?
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
Gucci what the penalty? Shawty what the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl, it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl, I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl, it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity

My girlfriend say she love me, but it's just the jewelry
Multicolor karats got your girlfriend kinda curious
First I drop my verses then I go and drop the chorus
Then I'm out the booth back to my trap, you know on Moreland
'74 restored it, Zaytoven record it
Say you chargin 30 like the Gucci can't afford it
Gucci chargin 40 dog, that's a couple birdies
Gucci stupid jewelry dog, I don't think you heard me

See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl, it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl, I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl, it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity
Huh (Big Cat Records)Embed
