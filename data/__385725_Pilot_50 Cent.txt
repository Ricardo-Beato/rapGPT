37 ContributorsPilot Lyrics

Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 Jet I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no
Bitches be on my dick, designer threads, I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)

Nigga every law and every rule I break
Feds tryna watch the moves I make
Everyday I get birthday cake
There's a hundred racks there in that safe
Hundred grams there on that plate
I ain't thinkin' 'bout catchin' no case
Nigga my safe house super safe
I zip Giuseppe's, I don't tie no lace
Tom Ford, Y-S-L, nigga, run and tell, I'm fly as hell
Big Bentley, Mulsanne, no LP, just two songs
A-side, B-side, Ryder gang, bitch, that's right
From N.O. to N.Y, I got shooters bitch, don't act cute and shit
We was born broke, no silver spoon
My niggas strapped, they super goons
These niggas here kinda soft
We get the bread, then fuck it off
Get more money, then fuck it off
Make your bitch wan' suck me off
We ain't had shit, we learned to ball
Them ghetto bitches they love us all
You might also like
Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 Jet I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no
Bitches be on my dick, designer threads, I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)

Shorty bounce it and she clap that
Slide down the pole, she's a super ho
That gold Cuban, I jack that
You niggas know how this 'sposed to go
I'm in the club with niggas, I clap that
That P90 I pack that
Your fuckin' head, I crack that
You wan' test me? Don't test me
Look, lover boy what're you trippin' for?
Niggas don't even want your ho
My nigga Ill fresh out the pen
You gonna make him go back again
Them bottles coming, we turnt up
Them sparks burnin' now watch us shine
You do this shit once a year
We do this shit all the time
Now captain come and save her
Get her from around this paper
She'll never be the same
I mean like everything will change
She cute blow a little cheese on her
Get her ass shots, throw D's on her
Them shoes more than you think though
My bitch look like my bank roll
Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 Jet I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no
Bitches be on my dick, designer threads, I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)
Better back up off me, bitch, watch me ball (ball)37Embed
