30 ContributorsCall of da Wild Lyrics
I hear voices

I'll be comin' around the ghetto when I come kickin' one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the Devil or whatever
I'm pickin' 'em up and throwin' 'em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson 'cause I slam the sons of bitches
I ain't braggin', folks draggin' me up and down the road (Yeah)
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my clownin' mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh, no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question "Should we take that bullshit from them people?"
I'm makin' 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckers tryna serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steerin' wheel, for them is tryin' to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin' and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer?
I think not, Officer Friendly tryna dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin' like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin' smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of the wild, nigga, uh, there it is
You might also like
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

As I step up, the stage is empty
No words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo', mane
Smokin' that dank dank, makin' mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruisin' down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn, I'd probably be mad even if I called up Uncle Sam
To bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B
Don't flex, I'm next, I break necks too
Rollin' with OutKast, P.A., Goodie Mob for the '94, dude
Ha-ha-ha; yeah, huh, you know what I'm sayin'? Ha

I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
Yeah, I'm steady buckin' motherfuckers
Not duckin' 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah, niggas
Squeezin' rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I's dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breakin'
Speakin' of breakin', break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fuckin' around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringin' the funk with the hollow tips
Player shit is how I'm kickin' it
Comin' around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a player
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair (Yeah)
Shit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek
See I'm a player, got my struggle on
Thinkin' about the volume and the thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer (Yeah)
Even though I never smoke that shit like... (Right) yeah (Yeah)
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, liftin' weights, gettin' swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothin', y'all can go to hells
Ain't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga? (No)
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

Khujo (Uh), comin' in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe (Yah)
So, bro, don't come 'round me (Uh-huh) with your flim flam, hot damn (Ooh)
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird (Hey)
K's madness into cappin'
Throw in a few more logs, so my fire lookin' through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked
But you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass (Ah)
I could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass
Shh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scopin', oh, my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo' crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of livin' is beginnin' to be a risky business
Uncaged, Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter meltin' through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs (Yah), this is your brain...
Dope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chappell Forest, it's gettin' horrid
The hunted child is on the prowl, yah!

I let out a call to the wild
My niggas in the 90's (Ha-ha)
For my nigga ridin' out to that
I let out a call to the wild
Say what you wanna do 'bout a couple million (Yah)
They keep calling me
Yeah2Embed
