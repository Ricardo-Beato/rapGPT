You're listening to Big Boy’s Neighborhood

Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin’ me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me (Oh no, cuz)
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me

Dead homies, where they at?
We be slidin’ with the wop
Dead homies, he a rat
He be sidin’ with the cops
Dead homies, where they at?
Don't be hidin’ when it's hot
Dead homies gettin' stacked
If you wackin' out the pop
Feds on me, hit the gate
Double back and hit the block
Feds on me, skip a state
I might buy another spot
Bread on me for the case
I ain’t never gettin' caught
And if you win, I'll take it on the chin
And take it to the box, dead homies
You might also like
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me (Oh no, cuz)
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me

I want whatever that you want, let's get it brackin'
Ain't want that talk and bullshit, I want that action
I need it all up front, that's what I want
Play and get stomped, I get active
No, I cannot stay in, I go dumb outside
I keep my hand on a cup of ice
No, I'm with the shits, I pull up, I slide
When the drama's high, I pull homicide
Click, clack, bang, bitch, I stay dangerous
You can't be friendly when you gangin'
Pushin' hard lines, talkin' brass, bitch
Talkin' reckless all up on the net, bitch

Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me (Oh no, cuz)
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me3Embed
