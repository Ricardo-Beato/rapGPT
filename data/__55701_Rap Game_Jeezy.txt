5 ContributorsRap Game Lyrics
They like, "Young where you been?" Niggas acting like I got ghost
Til' I came back in that black on black Phantom ghost
Looking better the Picasso y'all should frame me
Killing niggas Kunta Kinte y'all should hang me

Rap game fucked up but you can't blame me
Seen 'em come seen 'em go you know how the game be
Snowman's back, Young you too wild
Had to switch it up man niggas tryn' steal the style

Anyway any how the steering wheel black and mild
Make the broad back that ass up think I'm Juvenile
My leather too soft just like Wayne and Baby Nem
Teacher ask me what I wanna be told that bitch a ATM
Dream was to turn my whole block into a CVS
Can't trust them broads around the way, them bitches devious
Drop it in watch it make it circle like a DVD
62 and 125 half a quarter key

Rap game fucked up but you can't blame me
Seen 'em come seen 'em go you know how the game be
Snowman's back, Young you too wild
Had to switch it up man niggas tryn' steal the style
You might also like
Anyhow, anyway, snitch is born everyday
Best thing to do is get your money and stay out the way
Hustler of the Year, damn right let's be very clear
If you sell them bricks to rocks to stone then it's Belvedere
Posted on the block with the choppas guess it's vodka now
Hard slowed up niggas switched playing soccer now
Do it for the killer and the dealers know you heard of me
Young came back to save the day, see the urgency?

Rap game fucked up but you can't blame me
Seen 'em come seen 'em go you know how the game be
Snowman's back, Young you too wild
Had to switch it up man niggas tryn' steal the style1Embed
