4 ContributorsWho You Slidin’ Wit’ (Buckwild Mix) Lyrics
Yo what's the deal, miss?
I'm sayin', let me know somethin' right now
I mean, we've been dancin' all night
I been buyin' you drinks all night and shit
You goin' home wit a nigga or what?
Tell me somethin'

Uhh!
What up miss, who you hidin' wit?
Who you slidin' wit?
Who you ridin' wit?
We can jump in the SL
Rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last cause I sex well
What up miss, who you hidin' wit?
Who you slidin' wit?
Who you ridin' wit?
We can jump in the SL
Rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last cause I sex well

Hen', Rock an' Alize, I get drunk off
What up miss? Get wit a real man and cut that punk off
Everythin' gonna be all right
I been watchin' you watch me all night
I asked honey her name, and she told me: Celeste
She had big breasts, honey had me harder than a Spanish test
We on the dance floor, gettin' our boogie on
I see the hatas watchin' me wit they hoodies on
Tryin' to peep the ice under the sleeve, I'm like: It's time to breeze
Told honey: Let's leave
Took her to M&G's, got some eggs & cheese
Grits, fish cakes, and orange juice, freshly squeezed
When she finished her meal, I said: What's the deal?
For real, you goin' home, or you tryin' to chill?
She got close, whispered somethin' slow in my ear
And it ain't hard to tell where we goin' from here
Yeah!

If your game rusty, around your dame never trust me
Cause soon as you blink I'ma slide her off and bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lotta niggas I know are takin' care of kids that might be mine
I love to go low, I'm freaky like that
I never get caught creepin' cause I'm sneaky like that Uhh!
It ain't my fault your girl be ho hoppin'
And matter fact, the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin'
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walkin' crooked and her throat hurts
I hate to wait cause I'm not on a patient tip
Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship
And when you mention my name, it ring a bell
Ask any female, nobody do it like L
I met this chick Rhonda, who pushed the black Honda
Took her to the crib and bombed her with this big brown anaconda
Uhh!
What up miss, who you hidin' wit?
Who you slidin' wit?
Who you ridin' wit?
We can jump in the SL
Rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last cause I sex well
What up miss, who you hidin' wit?
Who you slidin' wit?
Who you ridin' wit?
We can jump in the SL
Rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last cause I sex well

Ayo I'm ready to get my flirt on
Want honey wit' the skirt on
She got knees that I would love to put some dirt on
I feel ya
I can't wait to get familiar
Leave wit' me, will ya? Tell me what's the deal, huh?
“I'm hidin' wit'chu, I'm slidin' wit'chu
I ain't catchin' a train, so I'm ridin' wit'chu
Just make the first move and I'ma follow ya lead
I can't wait to break you off some and swallow your seed
And I'm not jokin', Corleone you got me open
Whenever you around, I can't quit scopin'
And you the type of cat that have a bitch loc'in'
Heart broken
Stressed out and smokin'
I can't front Playboy, you be rammin' it right
Even though I got a husband, you my man for the night
I've been watchin' you
Got the hots for you
Yo, I'll fuck around and leave my baby pops for you
'cause I, love the way that you crash these walls
All you need is me, fuck these other nasty whores
And uh, whenever you want it, this ass is yours
You can slam dunk this pussy like basketballs.” (I hear dat...)
Uhh!
What up miss, who you hidin' wit?
Who you slidin' wit?
Who you ridin' wit?
We can jump in the SL
Rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last cause I sex well
What up miss, who you hidin' wit?
Who you slidin' wit?
Who you ridin' wit?
We can jump in the SL
Rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last cause I sex well
