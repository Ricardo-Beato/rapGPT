Tell her got bankroll
I tell her got bankroll
I tell her got bankroll
I tell her got bankroll

Got so much money, I'm a flexer
Need me some money, so I'ma finesse ya
One hunnit hondo, nigga catch up
Now ya bitch want me, get ya checks up
Got so much money, I'm a flexer
Need me some money, so I'ma finesse ya
One hunnit hondo, nigga catch up
Now ya bitch want me, get ya checks up

I'm getting money, not a stressor
If ya bitch on me, I'ma F her
Put her on my squad, they gone stretch her
Nigga ain't stupid, If he try test us
Cuz we got them uzi's, or them techs uh
We got extendos, bruh you get wet up
We got them things now that'll stretch ya
We don't do body, aim at yo neck up
Count money photos, that's a no no
Cause if you owe bro you catch this 4-4
Count money photos, that's a no no
Cause if you owe bro you catch this 4-4
