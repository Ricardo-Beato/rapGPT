I'ma shine bright like a star
Gotta prove everyone wrong
Had to take some time alone
Had to regroup, got that shit right
Had to upgrade, got that shit tight
Everything good, everything right

And now she sing
She sing bye-eye-eye-eye, uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Eye, eye-eye-eye, uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Eye, eye-eye-eye, uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is everything good? Everything right, everything good?
She sing bye-eye-eye-eye, uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Eye, eye-eye-eye, uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Eye, eye-eye-eye, uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is everything good? Everything right, everything good?

Uh, I'm cool (Cool)
Dropped a big bag on my jewels
Yup, that's right (Right)
One night change your life (Change)
Still can't have no wife (No)
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, dice (Ooh)
Get me right, ooh (A'ight)
That's too light, ooh (A'ight)
Gotta be hot (Hot, hot), gotta be hot (Hot)
Beat up the block (Pew, pew), reload the Glock (Beep, beep)
Take that shit in (Take it, take it)
Into the town (Into the town)
Shut that shit off (Shut that shit off)
Shut that shit off

I just spent eight thousand to play SEGA, ooh (Play SEGA)
Used to be broke, usin' food stamps at bodegas, ooh
Do it real big, do it mega, ooh
Game real tight, I'm omega, huh
Cut 'em off if you a traitor
You dead to me now (Dead)
You dead to me now (Dead)
You dead to me now
Took a different route
Put it in her mouth
Always with the gang
Make that baby sang
She might get a chain
And now she sing
She sing bye-eye-eye-eye, uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Eye, eye-eye-eye, uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Eye, eye-eye-eye, uh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Is everything good? Everything right, everything good?2Embed
