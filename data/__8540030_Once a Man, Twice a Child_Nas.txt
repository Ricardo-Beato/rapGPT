If you lucky, you get old
Old timer told me (Yeah)
"You ain't gon' be able to fuck the same
Drink the same, hang out the same"
I'm like, "Damn!" (Once a man, twice a child)
You get what I'm saying? (Yeah)
It's like, I wanna be running around forever like, you know?
Once a man, twice a child (Yeah)
It's like a baby again

Strong motherfucker when you're young
I ducked a razor, ducked some punches, even ducked a gun
Nintendo Duck Hunt, I ducked police, I had to run
Meanwhile, when you get old, you might become futile
My old style is a rough of my new style
My old girl dope but I love my new girl
So when I'ma slow down this merry go round called life?
I was a youngster with a fever, moms brought cold ice

And I was young, scared, she ain't care, she made me fight
Fifty-two sweep you haymaker right
When I get old, I hope that I can stay this fly
Once a man, twice a child
From mama's boy to preschool to college to now employed
Now you on, got your first crib, she's having your firstborn
Went from buying the finer toys with your boys
To buying toys for your boy
It's crazy how fast he's growing for sure
Grandpops, he told me ‘bout his days of old
One day I'll be him on the porch, sippin' on something cold
And it stuck with my soul, I been divided at the road
Hot-headed as a youngster, confronted, I might unload
Now listen, knowledge I received as a seed, as a G
That would feed my personal frequency
Transcends through all, travel through walls
My ministry we ain't know we was livin' hazardous
Savages, first niggas in New York with Bentleys
Tyson, Kedar, Puff, Stoute and then me
Before Many Men was out we went on tour and took 50
Live while you got the strength to, health you should tend to
Look, all of us ain't gon' get old I hope this message hit you
For real
You might also like
Strong motherfucker when you're young
I ducked a razor, ducked some punches, even ducked a gun
Nintendo Duck Hunt, I ducked police, I had to run
Meanwhile, when you get old, you might become futile
My old style is a rough of my new style
My old girl dope but I love my new girl
So when I'ma slow down this merry go round called life?
I was a youngster with a fever, moms brought cold ice

I'm tryna expand the pineal gland
The world ain't our home, just temporary please understand
You die tomorrow then you born again, so life is deathless
Respect and balance, human dignity, that's the perspective
Aimé Leon Dore New Balance when I'm steppin', time is precious
One day I might need my diaper changed inside a convalescent
The soul is different than the flesh is, life is teachin' me more
Wisdom and ignorance is kin, to have peace, you need war
By the time you see the stars in the skies, they already burnt out
Same way these dudes be shinin' but been burnt out
But we don't change, as we get stuck in our ways
We just act like we agree so we can end the exchange
What's meant for you is sent to you
But you could be the problem, it's not always them my dude
Was she crazy before you met her or you made her crazy?
Possibly she gon' be a nurse when you back to a baby
Once a man, twice a child
Strong motherfucker when you're young (Uh)
I ducked a razor, ducked some punches, even ducked a gun
Nintendo Duck Hunt, I ducked police, I had to run
Meanwhile, when you get old, you might become futile
My old style is a rough of my new style (Wild)
My old girl dope but I love my new girl
So when I'ma slow down this merry go round called life?
I was a youngster with a fever, moms brought cold ice

And in the streets I had agility, was quick to strike
My fear's not seeing it coming, got too rich for that sight
So take advantage of your youth before you elderly
'Cause today is the youngest that you will ever be2Embed
