Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh

Vette pass by, everybody looking
Six stoves in the house and everybody cooking
Wrist like, "Blaow," chain like, "Ow"
We throw it in the air to watch it come down
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu

This house is stupid perp, they cost me half a rack
AK half a stack, so we ain't gon hit back
I'm at the gambling house, I won 'bout eighty bands
And went to Magic City and did the rain dance
I'm the cave man, stupid band man
Rubber band man, I'm Extra Gram Sam
A stupid fruity sack, a stupid fruity pack
Crazy Gucci shoes, where you get 'em at?
I said it's all white, 'bout a fifty pack
The hottest nigga in the nation ain't dropped yet
Where them pots at? Where them Glocks at?
I kick the door in, where them plots at?
You might also like
Vette pass by, everybody looking
Six stoves in the house and everybody cooking
Wrist like, "Blaow," chain like, "Ow"
We throw it in the air to watch it come down
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu

Cartoon chain, Papa Smurf ring
All red wings, So Icey airplane
Gucci Mane hat, Gucci Mane shirt
Louis V shoes, Louis V purp
We ain't the Big Tymers, but bitch, we got work
We get our roll on in new school verts
Old school's cool, but most of ours new
Gesundheit, bitch, we got the bird flu
But we'll bless you, so say, "Achoo"
We'll turn them house shoes into some Prada shoes
On the east side, we play by Gucci rules
He's only in the hood when he's commissioned to

Vette pass by, everybody looking
Six stoves in the house and everybody cooking
Wrist like, "Blaow," chain like, "Ow"
We throw it in the air to watch it come down
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
The bird flu got me, the Jacob watch Rocky
Balboa'd the diamond now, I'm So Icey
Young Juiceman, goddammit, I'm the shit
Boomin' off the chain, workin' with fifty bricks
Now-a-later cars, crew blue chains
32 karat posted on my pinky ring
Been a hundred charger, sneaker color dump
Super bad bitch, ayy, pocket with the mumps, ayy
Common cold nigga, ayy, this ain't what you want, ayy
'72 donk, ayy, with no skirt
Whoa, six stoves cookin', mean we got work
Young Juiceman, cuz, smokin' nine pounds of purp

Vette pass by, everybody looking
Six stoves in the house and everybody cooking
Wrist like, "Blaow," chain like, "Ow"
We throw it in the air to watch it come down
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu
You riding vert, whoosh, them bullets go, "Whoosh"
You got a common cold, we got the bird flu2Embed
