One, two, three, four

Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
An afro, black boy with the gold teeth
With dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, comin' over to me, yeah

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want someone to love mе
I need someone who needs me
'Causе it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)
I need a baby with love in my prime
Need an adversary to my "down and marry"
Like, tell me "That's life" when I'm stressin' at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and, "Everything is alright," uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want67Embed
