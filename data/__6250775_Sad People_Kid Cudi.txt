100 ContributorsSad People Lyrics
Mm-mm, yeah
Mm-mm

In the dead of the night, I have these dreams
What'll happen to me? Will I burn out?
Have I been wrong? What does it mean?
All these things, can't understand why
Say something's wrong with me, I know
By myself alone driving, I go
Full moon as it glows, I search for truth
Tryna be brand new, yeah, I will try
No, I won't do but through these screams
Fighting and bleed, blood in my eye
And I'll be (Another broken soul)
God save me (Yeah)

Yeah, baby, see I'm back in my zone
Just what I need, mama (Yeah)
Nigga been in hell, the same ol'
On a mission and I'm gonna fly high (High)
This for the sad pеople who keep the blunt burning and we
Off on a journеy, you learn me
You might also like
Close call, life on the edge
Ahh, when the time comes, I'll find peace
Still in search of, nights, I'm sittin' wishin'
I can find love in me
Lettin' go, ooh, this ain't livin'
I swim in pain
Never drown, keep my head up above the waves (Get it, get it)
Tired of runnin', I won't run from fate
Late night, ooh, this is when I come alive, when the dreams made
Take me, ooh, just don't leave, babe
Come on, woah (Don't say goodnight)
Scars on my heart, woah (Ahh, ahh, ahh, yeah)

Yeah, baby, see I'm back in my zone
Just what I need, mama (Yeah)
Nigga been in hell, the same ol'
On a mission and I'm gonna fly high (High)
This for the sad people who keep the blunt burning and we
Off on a journey, you learn me19Embed
