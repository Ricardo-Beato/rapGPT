63 ContributorsCONFUSED! Lyrics
Hmm, oh

I might go losing it and drive off of a cliff
Fall in the void
And if I blow my brains out all over the scene
That's madness curing sadness (Hm-hm)
These walls ain't talking back, might as well finally paint them black
I'm out of ideas
The ceiling is all I have, downward from here
I'm ripping apart

Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?

Confused, truth is what I choose
Heal I never do
Asking, "Who are you?"
I don't have one clue
Seems I hate him, too
Seems my color's blue
Who?
You might also like
I always end up back in a cycle of shame
Looking in the mirror is hard (Hmm)
Some days, I hurt myself to distract me from distraction
That's madness fixing sadness (Hmm-mm)
Go on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain
But there's comfort in tears (Hmm-mm-mm)
Decoding my sacred heart, flying from here
No more falling apart, ah

Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete (Complete)
Who am I? Who are we?

I hate the drugs, but I love the numb (Hmm-hmh)
I hate the gun, but I want the sun (Hmh-hmh)
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb (Hmh-hmh)
I hate the gun, but I want the sun

Confused
Confused, truth is what I choose (Truth is what I choose)
Heal I never do (Heal, I never do)
Asking, "Who are you?" (Asking, "Who are you?")
I don't have one clue (I don't have one clue)
Seems I hate him, too (Seems I hate him, too)
Seems my color's blue (Seems my color's blue), ooh, woah, woah
Who?
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb (Hmm-hmh)
I hate the gun, but I want the sun (Hmh-hmh)
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb (Hmh-hmh)
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
