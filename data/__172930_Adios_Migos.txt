These bitches see a young nigga
Cause I'm walkin' round with these hundreds
And I pull up in that Lambo
So fast you ain't even see me coming
I got chickens out in the country
Got a AK finna start drumming
You was talking shit behind my back
But now here a nigga you ain't sayin' nothin'
Young rich nigga live forever, my trap game A1 clever
You say that I'm broke how dare ya'
I ain't never goin' broke never ever
Your arms and your legs I sever
Then feed em to the sharks for dinner
Quavo too hot like a kettle
Young nigga and I keep the heavy metal

Adios, adios, adios
You ain't talkin' cash nigga adios
Adios, adios, adios
You ain't talkin' to the plug nigga adios
Adios, adios, adios
If you ain't talkin' Benji's nigga adios
Adios, adios, adios
You ain't talkin' Guala nigga adios
You might also like
Yeen talkin' bout cash adios
I pull up in drop top convertible Rolls
My chain is all gold, the Fendi to Gucci to Louie
I see it I buy what I want
Young rich nigga I take a toast
Finessin' Pablo, he gotta go
Up on the boat, finessin' Pablo out his O's
Meetin' up with Carlito
I'm takin' them trips cross the globe
The dope that I smoke get you high, UFO
I'm sellin you ain't gettin' it back, no repo
It's finito, bitch adios
You standin' and lookin' like you seen a ghost
Maybe it's cuz I'm in this Phantom Ghost
I'm trippin' I just finessed you out the do'
Finessin' the plug, it's adios

Adios, adios, adios
You ain't talkin' cash nigga adios
Adios, adios, adios
You ain't talkin' to the plug nigga adios
Adios, adios, adios
If you ain't talkin' Benji's nigga adios
Adios, adios, adios
You ain't talkin' gwala nigga adios14Embed
