7 ContributorsTwenty1 Lyrics
Wrap it up and ship it out
Wrap it up and ship it out
Wrap it up and ship it out

When pack touched down, I was 21
I bought a F&N, hold 21
When I couldn't get a zip, I bought a 21
You ain't jump out in the streets, then you a you ain't jump out in the streets 'til you was 211
I was in the booty club 'fore I was 21
I lost my bestfriend when I was 21
I'm Slaughter Gang, bitch, and I'm 21
I just flooded out my wrist, it cost me 21

Wrap it up and ship it out
Yeah, cooking up that shit inside my grandma house
Your bitch, she love the gang, I put it in her mouth
I might tie your kids up and pistol whip your spouse
Hunnid gas bags, nigga, trappin' out a loft
Disrespect the Slaughter Gang, I'll get you off
I had a lot of fake friends, had to cut 'em off
And I'll pay you for pussy, tell me what it cost

When pack touched down, I was 21
I bought a F&N, hold 21
When I couldn't get a zip, I bought a 21
You ain't jump out in the streets, then you a you ain't jump out in the streets 'til you was 211
I was in the booty club 'fore I was 21
I lost my bestfriend when I was 21
I'm Slaughter Gang, bitch, and I'm 21
I just flooded out my wrist, it cost me 21
You might also like
I fucked your bitch and passed her, it took me 21 minutes
Bitch, I'm in the studio, I'll call you when I'm finished
Your baby daddy broke, I bet you still eatin' Wendy's
I'm pourin' up syrup, bitch, I don't drink Remy
I fucked your baby momma then I nutted on her titties
I hit for 20 bricks and then I went and bought a Hemi
I'ma real street nigga, I got street niggas with me
And free Big Guwop 'cause these rap niggas bitches

When pack touched down, I was 21
I bought a F&N, hold 21
When I couldn't get a zip, I bought a 21
You ain't jump out in the streets, then you a you ain't jump out in the streets 'til you was 211
I was in the booty club 'fore I was 21
I lost my bestfriend when I was 21
I'm Slaughter Gang, bitch, and I'm 21
I just flooded out my wrist, it cost me 21Embed
