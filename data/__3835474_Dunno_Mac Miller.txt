Well, we was fuckin', almost missed my flight
I wasn't even trippin', I said, "It's alright," yeah
Goddamn, we was hit last night
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?
You was coughin' when you hit my weed
But I've never seen you feel that free
So cute you wanna be like me
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?

Until, until there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the cloud
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down

Well, I was busy when you hit my phone
But you miss me, told me come back home
Yeah, and you don't really like to sleep alone
But I'm takin' too long, I'm always takin' too long, yeah
Baby, we don't need a trip, we could be right here
When the shit get weird, we could switch up gears
I wanna see them lips, kissin' ear to ear
I wanna hear your song
Oh, I wanna feel just how you feel
Touch you one more time so I know you're real
We could spin that wheel, wouldn't you rather get along?

Until, until there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the cloud
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down

I think we just might be alright, thank God
I think we're gonna be alright, alright, okay
Hold me close, don't hold your breath
This feelin' your favorite, I know29Embed
