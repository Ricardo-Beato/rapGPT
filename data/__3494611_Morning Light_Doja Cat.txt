I don't wanna waste your time
Go 'head and live your life
I could be yours tonight
We will be up 'til the morning
Don't wanna waste your time
Go 'head and live your life
I could be yours tonight
We'll be up 'til the morning
Light, light, light, light, light, light, light
Up 'til the morning light, light, light, light, light, light, light
Morning

Breakfast in bed, come and your lay your head
Down on me, bae, touch on my neck
Bacon and eggs, give you a taste
We let 'em wait, love me all day, oh
Don't say goodbye, kiss me goodnight
Yes, I say that hard work pays off, do you really know why?
I'ma show you why

Don't wanna waste your time
Go 'head and live your life
I could be yours tonight
We'll be up 'til the morning
Light, light, light, light, light, light, light
Up 'til the morning light, light, light, light, light, light, light

No covers on us, baby boy, 'cause I'ma bring the heat, ooh
See I ain't no trick just because I know how to treat you
Bet them men are jealous, you know they been tryna be you
But look, there's only one who touchin', wondering if they can be you

And we be rolling up all night
We be rolling up all night
We be rolling up all night
We be rolling up all night

Something, baby, your loving keep me up
Got me up until God knows in the morning
Fun times watching the sunrise with you
Be up until the morning light, yeah
Something, baby, your loving keep me up
Got me up until God knows in the morning
Fun times watching the sunrise with you
Be up until the morning light, yeah, nigga

Don't wanna waste your time
Go 'head and live your life
I could be yours tonight
We will be up 'til the morning
Don't wanna waste your time
Go 'head and live your life
I could be yours tonight
We'll be up 'til the morning
Light, light, light, light, light, light, light
Up 'til the morning light, light, light, light, light, light, light
