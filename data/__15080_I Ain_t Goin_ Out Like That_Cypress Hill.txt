Let's kick it, ese

Comin' out the slums, it's the hoodlums!
I'm pullin' my gat out on all you bungs
So bring it on when you wanna come fight this
Outlaw, kickin' like Billy Ray Cypress Hill
Chill, I'll bust that grill
Grab my gat, and load up the steel
And if you wanna get drastic
I'll pull out my plastic Glock automatic
Synthetic material, burial plots in order
Heading down to the Mexican border
Smokin' that smelly, Northern Cali
Gonna put a slug in Captain O'Malley
Ho, hum - hear the gat come, boom!
Let me see what you'll do
It's a sin to kill a man
But I'll be damned if I don't take a stand

We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that!
You might also like
I'm high strung, click I'm sprung
'Cause I don't live on the humdrum
Where I'm from, the gats be smokin'
I'll be damned if you think I'm jokin'
Know that I'll come with a static
Erratic, four-five automatic
Screamin' at ya, the red light's beamin' at ya
No need to have to run after
The punk ass hook, in the oven I'll cook
Dig the grave for the one who got played
Now he's under, don't make Stevie Wonder why
'Cause he'll testify

We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that!
I got you thinkin', "What the fuck is this?"
Lettin' you know I take care of business
Can I get a witness?
To verify when I depict this style
That makes ya ecstatic
Tragic, when I gotta pull out the magic buddha
When I roll with my crew
I betcha one time can't find my hootah
In my vehicle with the belt unbuckled
Pig rollin' up but he ain't that subtle
Pulled to the curb, so we exchange a few words
But he got me stirred up, enough to grab the handcuffs
I'll huff-n-puff and blow ya head off!

We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that!
Yeahhh! Takin' your disses and dissin y'all right back
It's the Cypress Hill crew, like we ain't shit
You little taco stand rapper, eat a bowl of dick up
Then you got my man over here, you can eat a bowl of dick up, too
Anybody got beef around the way, yo
Eat a bowl of dick up! GEEEYEAH!!4Embed
