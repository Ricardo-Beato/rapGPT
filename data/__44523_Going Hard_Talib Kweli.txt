18 ContributorsGoing Hard Lyrics
Ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah

I got a part to play, we going hard these days
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
When bullets start to spray the revolution start today
I say the shit these people ain't got the heart to say
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
When bullets start to spray the revolution start today

You say you never scared?
There's kids in other countries making jerseys, jeans, and sneakers they could never wear
Parents never there, they busy building homes they can't afford to buy
Cars they can't afford to drive, working jobs that don't support their life
You busy screaming Gangsta Gangsta, all that talk is trife
You already know lost the fight if you don't know the cost of life
These kids is forced to fight a war they can't outrun
Ain't got no shoes but got a gun, now where the fuck he pulled that out from?
People ask me how we wearing diamonds
When there's little kids in Sierra Leone losing arms for cryin' while they minin'
Probably an orphan whose momma died of AIDS
He built the coffin working often but he never paid
Forever slaving in the world that's forever cold
Becoming the man of the house at 11 years old
This reality rap, I get inside the mentality that
Terrorize you like a cowardly act
C'mon
You might also like
I got a part to play, we going hard these days
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
When bullets start to spray the revolution start today
I say the shit these people ain't got the heart to say
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
When bullets start to spray...Buck!


I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin'
Middle Passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denied history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their husbands be beaten viciously
Battlin' the wilderness of North America
Ran by the river, only stoppin' to pray, chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who fuckin' kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom for their protection deserve neither
Not a name, not tradition, religion, you learn Jesus
Turn the other cheek, inherit the Earth, just stay meek
Fuck the way you speak, try to run, we chop off your feet
Fast forward to 2004 we selling raw
Yo this ain't what I'm settling for, I want more, yo
I got a part to play, we going hard these days
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
When bullets start to spray the revolution start today
I say the shit these people ain't got the heart to say
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
When bullets start to spray the revolution start today
