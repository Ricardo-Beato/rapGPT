10 ContributorsThatâ€™s That Lyrics
Got dogs on the chains don't let em get loose
Sippin rich man juice thats a fo and a deuce
All my cars ain't got no roof
And I plead not guilty they ain't got no proof
Look in my closet I ain't got no suits
Two thousand dollar shirt, four thousand dollar boots
Broke ass nigga ain't got no clue
I'm so rich I could buy yo troops
Gucci going broke? You a god damn fool
Bitch so bad I'mma put her through school
These rap niggas dont move like me
When I move hundred y'all niggas gone move
You can run up but what it gon' prove?
Gucci Mane put you on the god damn news
Whole lotta ice and buncha tattoos
If ya choose me baby than ya know ya cain't lose

Baby got that fat back, and that's that
Pocket got them fat stacks, and that's that
Pull up in a whats that, and that's that
Worth a million bust that, and that's that
(If its my show than the club packed, and that's that)
(And ya might not get yo bitch back, and that's that)
(Yeah I'm smokin' on that loud pack, and that's that)
(That's dro-oh-oh)

Gotta bitch so bad, look ya give her note pad
Write it down on the book cause the bitch so bad
Front seat of the jag and her boyfriend mad
Sliding down South Beach with the Georgia tag
Swag so bad she'll ignore yo ass
Bossed up bitch employ yo ass
Red bottom heels and they match her bag
And she ridin' round the city just droppin' off swag
Real fat ass, do you got a man?
I gotta ask I gotta ask
Hunned yard dash  for the cash I threw
And my car so fast I'll lose yo ass
Ho so bad that she got you blinded
Kill her with kindness ya buyin her diamonds
Oh my I like the way you bend
Bitch so fine I'mma move her in
Hold up stop man damn I'm trippin'
Last thing I need to do is move that bitch in
Game work good, and real soon
What can I say baby I'mma tycoon
Gucci Mane I ain't finna jump no broom
But tell ya girlfriend she can jump in too
Whole lotta ice and bunch of tattoos
If ya choose me baby then ya know ya cain't lose
Baby got that fat back, and that's that
Pocket got them fat stacks, and that's that
Pull up in a whats that, and that's that
Worth a million bust that, and that's that
(If its my show than the club packed, and that's that)
(And ya might not get yo bitch back, and that's that)
(Yeah I'm smokin' on that loud pack, and that's that)
(That's dro-oh-oh)4Embed
