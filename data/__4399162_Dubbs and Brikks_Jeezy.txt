4 ContributorsDubbs and Brikks Lyrics
It's Hollywood nigga, you remember 
Cooked so many chickens they call me KFC
You can get original or extra crispy
 road is risky
In a highway  upstreet
 shopping from me
What you mean by original?
Fresh out the block
What you mean by extra crispy?
Fresh out the pot
I'm on the island 
 things
A nigga just payed me, want a 9 piece wings
A side of collard greens
You know, a couple pies
 my prices go down
Some Armond Hammer
Look out for the police scanner
What you need to make a mill dawg?
I don't know
Pyrax pots and  stove
Triple beam and some ziplock bags
And some bitch house man, to hide my stash
A wrental car and bout 4 or 5 bricks
You might also like
I ride dubs nigga, and I flip bricks
I guess what we tryna say man, we roll this shit
Kink B, you having cheese nigga
You goddam right
 all goddam night
I ride dubs nigga, and I flip bricks
I guess what we tryna say man, we roll this shit
Kink B, you having cheese nigga
You goddam right
 all goddam night

You ride dubs, and I flip bricks
Been doing this shit since 
You always told me that things'll never change
What I needed to do is maintain the game
So I suped up the game, made a little change
Knocking the  to put 10 on a Range
Now I'm still riding leather with the fuckin wood grain
TBE's and CD's, give you these mane
When them hoes see me, they be like that's a damb shame
Never did I think that Kinky be the man
From rags to riches, rats to bad bitches
To 
From bussin heads to duckin feds
To selling CD's making legitemet bread
I ride dubs nigga, and I flip bricks
I guess what we tryna say man, we roll this shit
Kink B, you having cheese nigga
You goddam right
 all goddam night
I ride dubs nigga, and I flip bricks
I guess what we tryna say man, we roll this shit
Kink B, you having cheese nigga
You goddam right
 all goddam night
 & Kinky B
When I pull up to the club, man hoes start to stare
 how you do that there?
When you see me in the club,  I don't discuss
1 800, bricks to us
That's my pager number so hit me up
Niggas riding the wave, thought I gave it up
Hell na, 
You know I'm still going coo-coo for kelos
 triple beam and leanin
 from the haters that's talking
 because the feds are watching
Nigga running around, talk about what we copping
Shit it ain't no stopping, man fuck them coppers
 we flip bricks
I guess you can say Corpret Thugs the shit
I ride dubs nigga, and I flip bricks
I guess what we tryna say man, we roll this shit
Kink B, you having cheese nigga
You goddam right
 all goddam night
I ride dubs nigga, and I flip bricks
I guess what we tryna say man, we roll this shit
Kink B, you having cheese nigga
You goddam right
 all goddam nightEmbed
