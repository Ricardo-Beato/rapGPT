31 ContributorsHimalayas Lyrics

GGP
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Sorry 4 the Weight-Weight, ayy
Gang, gang, ayy
Bang, bang, ayy
Sosa on the beat

Bitch say I'm always smokin'
Always drinkin', got some issues
Niggas always fuckin' plottin,' I was thinking, got some pistols
Pull up catch a nigga lackin', I was thinking, got a rental
Bitch, I'm from Chiraq, I was thinking, got some missiles
I was watching out for lizards, I was watching out for niggas
Pull up on the block at night, I was sparking with them niggas
But I had to catch a flight, now, bitch, I'm a damn LA'er
And I know I'm shining bright, but I'm from the Himalayas

I'm too turnt I'm TNT, bitch, I put the E in Key
And I put the lock on the door, couldn't blow this off if you had the heat
I got me and this weed, meeting with me and me and me
Little lady, I'm the I in the Win, bitch, I'm the E in the Beef
Fuck nigga, I'm the D in Deceased
Yo' bitch be the E on my Wee Wee
Yo' ass put the E in the Sheep
I'm the A in Shavin', and I'm off this weed
Yo' bitch put the E in the freak
She say you put the E in the Creep
Nigga, I don't be the E in the Sleep
Nigga, I be the E in Work All Week
'Cause I can't eat when I Sleep
She said I put the E in I Eat
I put the I in Do It, and I put the E in my Jeans
Bitch, I put the A in the Hawk, bitch, I put the E in that Eagle
Bitch, I put the A in the Choppa, bitch, I put the G in Illegal

Bitch say I'm always smokin'
Always drinkin', got some issues
Niggas always fuckin' plottin,' I was thinking, got some pistols
Pull up catch a nigga lackin', I was thinking, got a rental
Bitch, I'm from Chiraq, I was thinking, got some missiles
I was watching out for lizards, I was watching out for niggas
Pull up on the block at night, I was sparking with them niggas
But I had to catch a flight, now, bitch, I'm a damn LA'er
And I know I'm shining bright, but I'm from the Himalayas

Bitch, I put the E in lean, then I put the lean in Sprite
Bitch, I put the B in Black, bitch, I put the C in Cyph
Bitch, I put the E in White, bitch, I put the E in Red
Bitch, I put the E in Retarded, guns that pull up and leave dead
Bitch, I put the I in Sig, bitch, I put the I in Live
Bitch, I put the I in Grin, when I walk up in the building
Bitch, I be the A in Hand, when they giving me my digits
Niggas be the A in Playing 'till I be the P in Pistol
Bitch, I be the G in Gifted, bitch, I be the T in Whistle
Bitch, I be the T in Too Turnt, bitches be the T in Irri
She said, "You be the the G in Naggin", bitch, I be the A in Macking
I be the Y in Myself, niggas be the T in Tacky

Bitch say I'm always smokin'
Always drinkin', got some issues
Niggas always fuckin' plottin,' I was thinking, got some pistols
Pull up catch a nigga lackin', I was thinking, got a rental
Bitch, I'm from Chiraq, I was thinking, got some missiles
I was watching out for lizards, I was watching out for niggas
Pull up on the block at night, I was sparking with them niggas
But I had to catch a flight, now, bitch, I'm a damn LA'er
And I know I'm shining bright, but I'm from the Himalayas43Embed
