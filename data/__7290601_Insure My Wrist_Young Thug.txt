(Taurus)
Yeah, I don't believe ya
When you say you're different
(Taurus)
'Cause I heard it all before
Yeah

Half a million, got insurance on my watch
Half a million, now I got me some insurance on my wrist
I told lil' ma be careful, bitch, this all on my expense
I told her watch the wheels on the Bent' 'cause it ain't rented
Talk about that bitch, oh, I got plenty
I'm talkin' 'bout a lot, like a million bucks in pennies
These pussies riding waves, so why they motherfuckin' spending?
And my diamonds black like spades, and I'm smilin' and grinnin'

My mama told me, "Pick up the phone"
I got a call from the label sayin' it's coming in strong
I just called up my old lady, told her, "Go get what you want"
I put these racks on your potatoes, your tomatoes get gone
She ask me who I am when she see me
I'm just that nigga wit' that million dollar T.P.
I came from nothin' but that ain't how the world see me
I'm kinda happy, I guess that's how the girls skeet me
I told my nigga, "Don't be worried 'bout no CeCe"
I'ma have your shit together by your B-day
Told him just don't go out sad or be no cheapskate
I wanna see you on a building out on Peachtree
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Half a million, got insurance on my watch
Half a million, now I got me some insurance on my wrist
I told lil' ma be careful, bitch, this all on my expense
I told her watch the wheels on the Bent' 'cause it ain't rented
Talk about that bitch, oh, I got plenty
I'm talkin' 'bout a lot, like a million bucks in pennies
These pussies riding waves, so why they motherfuckin' spending?
And my diamonds black like spades, and I'm smilin' and grinnin'

I'm puttin' a trackin' chip inside my watch
Got rich with felons, ain't no tellin', I can never be a cop
Set of Forgis on Pirelli, got me swervin', dodging pots
My investor done invested all my extras in the stocks
How I make it through the killings? How I'm here to see the vision?
Save until that money rot, I stack it to the ceiling
Give 'em everything you got, shoot a fully 'til its empty
Let 'em know, don't ever tempt me, well-respected in the city, uh
Money grown, I had to bring my Lamborghini out
Rich on my own, I brought it home and now my family proud
I got some tucked away in case we get a rainy cloud
We poured a couple eighths today, I woke up on a cloud

Half a million, got insurance on my watch
Half a million, now I got me some insurance on my wrist
I told lil' ma be careful, bitch, this all on my expense
I told her watch the wheels on the Bent' 'cause it ain't rented
Talk about that bitch, oh, I got plenty
I'm talkin' 'bout a lot, like a million bucks in pennies
These pussies riding waves, so why they motherfuckin' spending?
And my diamonds black like spades, and I'm smilin' and grinnin'
Yeah, I don't believe ya
When you say you're different
