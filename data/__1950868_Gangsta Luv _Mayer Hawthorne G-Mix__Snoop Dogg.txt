2 ContributorsGangsta Luv (Mayer Hawthorne G-Mix) Lyrics
Radio killa
Big snoop d o dub
The american dream
Ayo nephew
Why don't you come up off them keys
Sing a lil something for the ladies
You know what I'm talkin 'bout
Let em know how we feelin' right now

Everytime I come around
Shawty love me down
Run up on me like click clack
Throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doing what we do in back of the 'Lac
I'm like I'm up all for that, and every night her body gets strapped how bout
That Gangstaa G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta
That gangsta love

Yeah she love it the way I put it on her
Blowing trees summer breeze sippin Coronas
Boss dog I give it to her right and she like it
She on the hip like a Sidekick, izzy
One of the coolest of fool on the flo
I whispered in her ear, come here you ready to go?
I rolled up a winna and put it up in the air
Got that lil dress on you comin up outta there, yeah
She like that, you like that
You say you bite, well I bite back
And I'm all go, we can do it till tomorrow
I beat it up like Harpo
Snoopy, I go hard baby yes
Kissin on ya chest and I'm diggin out your stress
I won't stop till your finished
But you ain't felt love till a gangsta get up in it. Dream
You might also like
Everytime I come around
Shawty love me down
Run up on me like click clack
Throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doing what we do in back of the 'Lac
I'm like I'm up all for that, and every night her body gets strapped how bout
That Gangsta G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta
That gangsta love

She always cold in the middle of the night
Coz ima dogg ima give her what she like
She say ma name loud, I say her name low
That's what I aim fo, that's how the game go
Baby like the way I wake her up
Cause Imma gangsta I grab her by the butt
Pull her to my side, I'm in deep
Woke that ass up, just to put her to sleep
Everyday is the same thang, I creep in
It's like true blood, I sink my teeth in
I gotta have it, the L B raise me
We was taught to dig em down crazy
Lights out, I'm so lit
Mama's so gone, daddy won't quit
I won't stop till your finished
You never felt love till a gangsta get up in it. Dream
Everytime I come around
Shawty love me down
Run up on me like click clack
Throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doing what we do in back of the 'Lac
I'm like I'm up all for that, and every night her body gets strapped how bout
That Gangstaa G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta
That gangsta love

This the life that you chose
The loop, the coupe, the grows
Anything goes
It's so good got her wiggling her toes (wow)
The boss, the Dream
The floss, the cream
The trips overseas
All these things really don't mean a thing
When I'm tearing that ass up workin you like a shift
I give it to you like a gift
You hear what that boy say
You wouldn't jack, give it up fast
Then I hit it from the back
Snoopy your so good, she screaming and I like that girl
She off in another world
I won't stop till your finished
She love this gangsta, especially when I'm in it. Dream
Everytime I come around
Shawty love me down
Run up on me like click clack
Throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doing what we do in back of the 'Lac
I'm like I'm up all for that, and every night her body gets strapped how bout
That Gangstaa G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta
That gangsta loveEmbed
