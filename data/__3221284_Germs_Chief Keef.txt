27 ContributorsGerms Lyrics
This bitch said all I do is flirt
Fuck hoes and all I do is dirt
Man, all these niggas do is purr
I'm skrt-skrting, finna do a curb
Sit back, all you gotta do is learn
I stay trapping, all I do is earn
Your bitch went on you, ‘cause you a therm
But you can have her back, 'cause she has germs

I got big rings, I got big bank
I got chips, Lays, finna hit Chase
Eating filet mignon, aye
Living like a playa, priest to a maid
It's all about the free, she gon' let me skeet
She said you rollin', we put you on E
I gotta bitch that look like Kelly Bundy
Back then she woulda said that I was ugly

This bitch said all I do is flirt
Fuck hoes and all I do is dirt
Man, all these niggas do is purr
I'm skrt-skrting, finna do a curb
Sit back, all you gotta do is learn
I stay trapping, all I do is earn
Your bitch went on you, ‘cause you a therm
But you can have her back, 'cause she has germs

Hi baby doll, come meet ice
You are all doomed to delight
Give me some Sprite and some ice
Walked in the bank like, "hi honey, I'm home,"
Think I'm Randy Moss, I'm going wide
She think I'm Krayzie Bone, but she gon' let me bone
You saying this and that, but you high
I'm in LA but I'm on my fucking way to Rome
Turn a .4-0 to two tone, you know I gotta shit on em
Gotta get my poop on, I was tired of riding trucks
Had to get my coupe on, I started with one verse
Had to get my two on

This bitch said all I do is flirt
Fuck hoes and all I do is dirt
Man, all these niggas do is purp
I'm skrt-skrting, finna do a curb
Sit back, all you gotta do is learn
I stay trapping, all I do is earn
Your bitch went on you, ‘cause you a therm
But you can have her back, 'cause she has germs3Embed
