Call me when you leave
Ostentação, palavra que eu gosto de ouvir
Sand touch your toes when you cookin' breakfast
Pacific Ocean out the backyard lookin' sexy
Straight shot, codeine, no chase
Don't let your dreams go to waste

I'ma need fresh air
What I need? Fresh air (what I need, what I need)
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Girl, I need

Move on
Opportunities come once a lifetime
Without you
Never broke, play yaself, don't forget I had that
Come on
Feelin' like Janet Jackson said, it's all for you
Never try to put the navigation, when I'm lookin' for it

I'll be right back, I'm on auto-pilot for the week
I'll be right back
Bad, bad, but she lookin' badder every week
You might also like
On some shit to make you mine
Tell me where the safety at
Tell me where the security at
Movin' up to bigger paper bag
Tell me, tell me, is it impossible
To do these drugs and fall in love?

I'ma need fresh air
I'ma need fresh air
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Girl, I need

Ohhh
Sand touch your toes while you cookin' breakfast
Pacific Ocean out your backyard, lookin' sexy
Straight shot, codeine, no chase (no chase)
Don't let y'all dreams go to waste

I'll be right back, I'm on auto-pilot for the week
I'll be right back
Bad, bad, but she lookin' badder every week
I'ma need fresh air
I'ma need fresh air
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Girl, I need
Girl, I need
I'ma need
Girl, I need
I'ma need

Tell me, why wait?
If I need to breathe
Tell me why suffocate
If I need to breathe
Breathe, breathe
If I need to breathe
Breathe, breathe
We, we, we, we

I'm mad, I'm mad, you know that I'm mad
Tipped up the scale, now pullin' off to Dubai
I'm mad, I'm mad, you know that I'm mad
Where is the love tonight? Where is the drugs tonight?
I need that shit right away
I just need fresh air right away
I just need fresh air right away
All I need is fresh air
I'ma need fresh air
I'ma need fresh air
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Girl, I need
Girl, I need
I'ma need
Girl, I need
I'ma need

I need that shit right away
I just need fresh air right away
I just need fresh air right away
I'ma need fresh air
I'ma need fresh air
I need to get out of my home
It's been too long
Girl, I need11Embed
