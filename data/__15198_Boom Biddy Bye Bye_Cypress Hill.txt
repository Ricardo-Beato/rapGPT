Boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye

Step back as I'm kicking up dust for a while
As I put motherfuckers to rest and pull their files
Out from the cabinet with the picture
Get the .45 and settle it with this punk nigga
Slow your roll as I take control
Take your toke from the Indo', then hit and hold
Now let it out–how you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls, and you're coughing up a lung anyhow?
You can't shake that nigga that's gonna break, fool
On any one member of your bitch crew
As I pull the trigger on my nine
Say goodnight nigga–Boom biddy bye bye!

Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome, and you start to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die?
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga, boom biddy bye bye
You might also like
You ain't never caught a rabbit, so you ain't no friend of mine
It's a habit barkin' up your tree with my nine
Keep your bitch on a leash or at home
A nick knack, paddywack, give the dog a bone
The raw dog, fuck a law dog
Still handin' out beat-downs wit' my sawed-off
'Cause every now and then, I got to knuckle up, buckle up
Chin checking, It's on, I reckon
It's the wild, wild West
Get your 40 and your blunt and your Glock and your bulletproof vest
Let me guess, everybody wanna test?
Everybody running up, gonna get burned like Ses
Lodi Dodi, we fucking everybody
Boom biddy bye, sing the lullaby in the party

Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome, and you start to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die?
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga, boom biddy bye bye
Yes, yes y'all
Yo the beat, y'all
Watch a punk slippin' see the puto fall
I'm buck-loody, looking for the nigga who wanna cut me
'Cause the nigga gets so funky
Fool, I'm the one from the big bad Cypress Hill clique, a
Number one son of the funk freaka
Yes, yes y'all
I'll be the one with the mad Buddha blast, y'all
Comin' from the West, y'all
But I figure you'd cry like a bitch
Don't twitch 'cause I just might pull the trigger
Now lay down, stay down
Don't move a muscle if you see your homeboy's brains on the ground
Don't fuck, don't say nothin'
You fuck around and I might get ragamuffin
Boom biddy bye bye
Lined up on the floor, now you all gonna die!

Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome, and you start to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die?
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga, boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome, and you start to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die?
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga, boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye
It's time to die
Boom biddy bye bye
Time to say goodbye
Boom biddy bye bye
Now it's time to die
Boom biddy bye bye
Now it's time to die6Embed
