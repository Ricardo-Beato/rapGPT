22 ContributorsLORD Lyrics
In '76, you know, they'd stop fighting
They just start shooting
You know, and it was somethin' new to me
You know we use to fight all the time
And the next minute I'm runnin' from gunshots
So, only thing I said to myself
Say man, are we gonna start doing what they doing?
You know, same thing they do to us we do to them
And would you believe but he had to, you know
Either do or die, or stay in the house
You know, fight or stay in the house
So I wasn't gon' stay in the house for nobody

I ain't never really care about shit
Soon as my father abandoned his kids
I was down for the problems
I promised my momma
I wasn't gonna die, so I got this revolver
Hammers will heal what a fist can't fix
Won't get down I'ma sent 'bout six
Ain't no questions, I'm wit' that shit
On the highway to hell but it still ain't jail
Gotta plug and a scale, tryna make this money
Crooked ass police tryna take this from me
Either watch yo step, or you catch that weap
Niggas take your life cause you ain't worth shit
Tell my momma don't trust not a soul that she meet
9 times outta ten niggas just like me
Tryna come up off the next man
Hammer in my left hand
Voice from grandma yelling from the dead
You might also like
She said just pray to sweet Lord Jesus
But he can't do shit, when you bleeding
Still ain't got no food in that freezer
You gon' do whatever you need cause
God don't come when it's niggas at the door
Shimmy shimmy ya, I'ma give to him raw
Roaches in the hallway, sleeping on the floor
Welcome to the land of the lost and destroyed

My brother Smalls, told a nigga focus on the money
But why try when they tryna take a nigga under
Spend a thousand every time a nigga make a hundred
And they wonder why I'm wild when I'm out in public
Demons form in the presences of nothing but struggle
It's easy to hustle when knowing nobody love you
Ain't nothing to lose, this money to gain
Fuck playing by the rules, shoot him in his brain
Life change when you take shit by the reins
Sitting in the rain wit' a Glock nine
Waiting for the bus on Ximeno
I wish a bitch would roll by on some funny shit
Niggas know I got mines
Hard times make niggas face hard time in a cell
Never heard of Hell, only heard of home
Hardly ever there, shit, I rather roam
Voice of my grandma yelling from the dead
She said just pray to sweet Lord Jesus
But he can't do shit, when you bleeding
Still ain't got no food in that freezer
You gon' do whatever you need cause
God don't come when it's niggas at the door
Shimmy shimmy ya, I'ma give to him raw
Roaches in the hallway, sleeping on the floor
Welcome to the land of the lost and destroyed

If 1st and 2nd Corinthians, could give a nigga spinnin' rims
Or Christina Milian, I'd prolly give that shit a chance
Coulda went the college route, but I chose the nigga plan
Broken heart sitting on my path, try and watch my step
God blessed the child with a gift then he turned his back
Told him choose his own way, guess I chose the wrong way
But it's only one way, either wit' the gunplay
Or you getting dumped on, nigga ain't a soul safe
I live my life as if a nigga could get killed tonight
Niggas running at they mouth like they wanna die
I ain't the passive nigga most would probably wanna try
In the land of the lost only the strong survive
Riding round wit' 4s under the seat
In a four door Jeep that's 400 degrees
Looking for my enemies, they haunt me when I sleep
So any motherfucker that taunt me getting shot5Embed
