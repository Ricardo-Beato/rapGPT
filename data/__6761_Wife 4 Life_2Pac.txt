6 ContributorsWife 4 Life Lyrics
Tat Chat Chat Ooooooooooh
4th Avenue Jones'
K-Ci himself (himself, himself) Shabba dabba dee swee swee
Ha Ha Oh yeah, lemme tell ya now, oh yeah

I never planned that I'd be married to settle no chance (yeaah)
Wedding bands rock the heaviest metal
And I'm the center hip hop
My M3 seat three, don't need comission (that's right)
So either we rhyme or design the beat to flip with
Don't stick with music 'cuz I hand lose it
It seranades me while I land cruise it
If I'm stressed or soothing
Something I can make the fans move with
Said I be singing til I saw you was like "Man, who dis?"
While JD Mingle be gettin at you with a brand new twist
Switchin my linger, wishin I could be the one you cling to
I ask you for you number maybe I can ring you
Six months later when I'm sick my baby bringin me food
Hang with the fellas I said "Mainly, I'll be hangin wit you"
Ready to have that satisfaction of you saying "I do" (yeaaaah)
Since you finally did it, now we together mind, body, spirit
That's something can't no body interfere with, for life (for life)

For Life
My Wife for Life
You say, "Yes"
Yes you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
For Life
My Wife for Life
You say, "Yes"
Yes you will be my wife
My wife, my wife for life

I bet you be strapped at point little pubs
Said she never give her number out to dudes in the clubs
That's the boogees and exceptions cuz she's showing me love
Body bangin like the county but I avoid the rub
Prolly to use to dudes jockin, all I asked was a hug
So she slid me the digits, mashed out in a Bug
A couple months pass, and we the item 'round town
But I'm feelin like the worm, like she just want me for the rebound
She fresh outta - relationships that only got her - heartache and pain
Frustrated because of drama
I'm lookin' at your face picturing kids and I can see em
Til death do us part we got the match and mazzaliam
On poppa's DM, I'll put you in the chrome BM
You different from the rest you love God and MCing
Whether it be tattoo, rings or bling (bling)
50 karat, you my wife 4 life, we got our backs and it's apparent
For Life
My Wife for Life
You say, "Yes"
Yes you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
For Life
My Wife for Life
You say, "Yes"
Yes you will be my wife
My wife, my wife for life

So ya heard
When I asked
That night you'd be my wife
Not for this year or next
But mine for all life (that's right that's right)
To accept me when I'm seein
And to understand
Not to make this dim in the rain
Which comes as hard as any
I'm not the best of men
My fault has come scarse tonight
But my heart has always - been to give to my wife
Yes you are baby (ah, ah, Tena Jones)
Tena Jones, been picky 'bout men, don't want some common fella
Contaminatin' me like salmanila
Workin undercover like my rhyme umbrella
Keepin it shady, I'm not going for it though, not even maybe
Showin' proof to you the difference from a rag and from a lady
I can do for myself, makin my bacon living gravy
And thankin' the Lord, 'cuz more importantly He saved me
I shot for the moon - lookin for comets like I'm Haley
I found me a star companionship is what it gave me
I'm beautiful too, and not because my hair is wavy, that's my baby
I said

For Life
Your Wife for Life
I say, "Yes"
Yes, I will be your wife
Your wife your wife
For Life
Your Wife for Life
I say, "Yes"
Yes, I will be your wife
Your wife your wife

For Life
My Wife for Life
You say, "Yes"
Yes you will be my wife
My wife my wife
For Life
My Wife for Life
You say, "Yes"Embed
