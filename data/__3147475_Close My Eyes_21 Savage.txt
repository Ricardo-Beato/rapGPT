Lot of shots (Yeah, yeah)
Lot of shots (Lot of shots)
30s on Glocks (Hollow tips)
30 shots (How I came)
Lot of shots (How I came)
Lot of shots (Four, five)
30s on Glocks (TEC-9)
Lot of shots (Yeah, yeah)
30s on Glocks (Lot of, what?)
Put you on Fox (Hold up, what?)
Nigga we ain't goin' (Fox 5)
Lot of shots (Breaking news)
30s on Glocks (Red shirts)
30s on Glocks
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Lot of shots, hold up
30s on Glocks, hold up
Put you on Fox, hold up
Put 'em in a casket, yeah
Pull up on a Banshee, yeah
Nigga, fuck your handshake, yeah
Feel like I'm the last real rapper 'cause these niggas weird
Nah, these niggas queers
Sippin' Act, Cheers
In my own lane, nigga, watch where you steer
Think I got 'em scared, shot 'em in the beard
That's a chin check, I'm certified everywhere
Man, I'm certified for real, nigga
Nah, for real, nigga
Used to record right on deal, nigga
Nah, for real, nigga
Pillow talking get you killed, nigga

Keep my gun cocked for real, bitch
Nah, for real, bitch

Nah, for real, bitch
Cut your lawns off for real, bitch

I don't wanna go to sleep, I'm way too high, dawg
I can't get no sleep, I swear I'm way too high, dawg
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dawg
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dawg
Peel a hotbox when it's time to ride, dawg

I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dawg
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dawg

Molly make ya' jaws lock
Nah, for real, dawg
This bitch done got me pissed off

Tryna make a brick lock, whip your wrist, dawg
Tryna make a brick lock, whip your wrist, dawg
I bought a 9 and he front a 9, that's a half a brick
Got a 'Rari nigga in the back still in the 6
We was young, you was on the swing, I was playin' with sticks
In the trap, listenin' for the brakes on a Crown Vic
Hear the motherfucker squeak, we gon' hit the cut
Trickin' niggas in the spot, we gon' stick 'em up
Fox Five gang, coroner gon' pick 'em up
Breaking news gang, nigga, put your trigger finger up
Yeah, all my niggas throwed off
Drive by, shoot your doors off
Turn your four-door to a coupe, nigga
Yeah, knock the noodles out your soup, nigga
Yeah, Zone 6 niggas love to shoot niggas
Yeah, you heard 'bout it
Nigga, we ain't worried 'bout ya
Hang around real shottas, hang around real robbers
Y'all nigga real killers, pullin' up real yoppas
I don't wanna go to sleep, I'm way too high, dawg
I can't get no sleep, I swear I'm way too high, dawg
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dawg
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dawg
Peel a hotbox when it's time to ride, dawg
If you froze up last time, then you can't ride, dawg
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dawg
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dawg

Go against the gang, that's like suicide, dawg (Yeah)
Go against the gang, that's like suicide, dawg (21)
Walk-ups only, we don't shoot and drive, dawg
We woke the neighbors up, at first the street was quiet, dawg
Have you ever did a real homicide, nigga?
Have you ever made a nigga mama cry, nigga?
Do or die nigga gotta do or die, nigga (21)
If you ain't the one doing it, you gon' die, nigga (21)
Sometimes I look at God and I wonder, "Why?," nigga
Why my niggas had to be the ones that died, nigga? (Why?)
They killed one, we gon' kill five, nigga (Facts)
Winter time, we gon' set your block on fire, nigga (On God)
Yeah, yeah, like the 4th July, nigga (21)
Broad day, lettin' them bullets fly, nigga (Pow-pow-pow-pow)
Pull up with a stick like I'm Sah, nigga
Gang gang, dare a nigga to try it, nigga
I don't wanna go to sleep, I'm way too high, dog
I can't get no sleep, I swear I'm way too high, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog
Peel a hotbox when it's time to ride, dog
If you froze up last time, then you can't ride, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog4Embed
