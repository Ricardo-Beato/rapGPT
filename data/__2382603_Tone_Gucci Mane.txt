Huh
(Mike WiLL Made-It) It's Gucci
Huh Yeah yeah
Mike Will
Trap god
(Mike WiLL Made-It)
It's Gucci
Huh

I'm in a rolls Royce in the backseat
Pull up to the club I'm just one deep
Its gunplay if a nigga jump me
Cause I'm an OG just like Bun B
RIP to Pimp C rest in peace
CEO Gucci call me Eazy fuckin E
Glock forty in my ree's I'ma keep it G
Half a pound in my briefs cause I like to chief
I'm discreet but I'll serve you right in front the street
And you a liar saying the FBI is watching me
I'm a mob guy you think I come from Italy
I got a 458 and its Sicilian

I'm tone round a couple
2 ad bitches thick mothafuckas
I got cash with me
Tone round a duffle
I got a strap with me
Tint with the mufflers
Who wanna scrap with me
Gucci brought the muscle
I don't tussle with these niggas I'm a hustler
I got them bands on me
Tone ya too long bruh
Gotta man up it's time for you to stand up
Run up ya bands wit me
You might also like
If ya girl chose the plug she's a real smart girl
You a strug' I'm a plug it's a real cruel world
She's a real cool girl
Blowin strong with the goons
Baddest bitch in the room but she wouldn't clip her wool
I'm sippin rum with ya mom fresher than you hittin the prom
Imma fuck her till she cum
Get her sprung
Hit the bong
She in love with my swag
I'm in love with her tongue
Fell in love with her esophagus
I swear her head the bomb
If I stood on all my money
I'd be taller than Lebron
And my top keep dropping back just like the hairline on Lebron
Call me uncle when you see me cause I used to fuck your aunt
Had a threesome with your mom now you look just like my son

I'm tone round a couple
2 bad bitches thick mothafuckas
I got cash with me
Tone round a duffle
I got a strap with me
Tint with the mufflers
Who wanna scrap with me
Gucci brought the muscle
I don't tussle with these niggas I'm a hustler
I got them bands on me
Tone ya too long bruh
Gotta man up it's time for you to stand up
Run up ya bands wit meEmbed
