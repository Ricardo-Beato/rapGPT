27 ContributorsReturn of the B-Boy Lyrics
Yo, yo, yo, yo, is '87 in the house?
(Hell yeah)
Is '88 in the house? (It's the master, the master)
(Hell yeah)
So everybody get on up (Pharcyde's in the house)
Everybody get on up (Here we go)

Uh, yes, yes, y'all
I got the fever for the flavor of a beat, y'all
I stand tall, gets raw like beef, y'all
I moo-moo like a cow, honey, child
Or, ooh, uh, one, two
'Cause I check it
Baby, just lend me your ear for a second
'Cause I'm wreckin' eardrums cold, Black+Deckin'
Hold on the horse 'cause the force is like dark
If you can't slide, then stay out the park
If my preachers don't know you, then hop off the ark
Are you hip? Do you need another tip?
'Cause that's just like a talk light in the ass crack tip
Jump on it
Shake your shit if you want it
Show no shame, hey, Malik, goddamn, get your arrow and hang
It ain't no thing to jam on it, jam on it (You don't stop)
You might also like
The debonair MC in the place to be
Came to rock the B-boys and the young ladies
Gonna rhyme on the microphone all night long
So the party won't stop until the break of dawn
It's like that, y'all, it's like this, y'all
When I play, B-boy don't miss, y'all
Some people wear all that Fila gear
Gonna rock this party out the atmosphere
Say ho (Ho)
Yeah, and you don't stop

Throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
If you're sparking blunts with clean underwear
Somebody say, "Oh yeah" (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
And you don't stop
Yo, 'cause back in '89, I was doin' the wop
Back and forth, forth and back
I'm from the streets now, I'm a straight mack
Skin is black (What?), hair is brown (What?)
Eyes are red, you know that I can get down
When I get up on the mic, I kick the rhymes to life
Because I'm fresh, and I'm def tonight
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh, uh-huh
Yo, West Coast, West Coast, West Coast is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn, motherfucker, burn

Check it out
Well, my name is Jammer and I'd like to say
That I'm a super def rapper comin' straight from LA
Five-ten, brown skin, twenty-three years old
And all the ladies love me 'cause I'm pigeon-toed
I step in the party and I bust my move
Cold rock a mic with the hip-hop groove
Sucker MC try to call my bluff
You better beware 'cause I'm just too tough, y'all
Please, please, y'all, please, please, check it out
Y'all, yeah, yeah, y'all
Yeah, please, please, check it out
So stomp your feet and clap your hand
While the DJ is spinning on the DJ stand
On the turntable, one and two
We got the grand incredible cuttin' just for you
Like this (Like what?)
Like this (Like what?)
Like this (Like what?)
(Do that shit, do that shit, do it)
All my rhymes are hard as hell
I am the one and I prevail
You will sail, you will fail
I am the doctor
Please, please, what? Please, please, check it out
Y'all, y'all, please, y'all, y'all, y'all, please, check it out
Y'all, y'all, y'all, please, y'all, please, please, check it out
Party over here (Party over here)
Yo, party right here (Party right there)
Yo, party over there (Party in your mouth)2Embed
