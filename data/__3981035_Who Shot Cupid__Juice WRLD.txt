Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Bitches on me, that's often
Doin' them beans often
Purps on the beat

She know me well, well, well, she know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)
Super worth it (Uh)
Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing for sure, one thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

We ain't gon' do this, not again
Gucci cardigan, I'm the flyest gent
I found out what the problem is, breakin' promises
It was the both of us

Oh, all girls the same, same, same
Two blue pills to the brain, brain, brain
Yeah, I kinda miss your brain
And I bet you miss my fame
You might also like
She know me well, well, well, she know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)
Super worth it (Uh)
Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing for sure, one thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I bet I'll never die again
Bullets fly again, Cupid hit his target
Guess he's been target practicing
Devils panickin', it makes it worse for my heart

Oh, girls aren't the same, same, same
But it's still two pills to the brain, brain, brain
I hope you never change, change, change
I also hope we put the drugs away

Well, well, well, well
She do me well
I hope she loves me for real
'Cause I been through hell
All the drugs I did
They weren't worth it, now I'm worthless
I hope my new lady thinks I'm perfect, oh
Sometimes I feel like that she'll be better off
Without me but without her I would die, oh
I would die, oh
She know me well, well, well, she know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)
Super worth it (Uh)
Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing for sure, one thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)45Embed
