I never really had nothing to hide, like, it was never really no filter in my head, like, "Would it be not cool to talk about your emotions?" And you know like, it was never nothing in my, in my consience, in my head to tell me not to do that
Going through something, music not only is something that kind of helps the situation pass, I also make music talking about certain subjects, because I know that I'm not the only one that's going through, you know, what's happening
Me talking about certain things could help somebody else through what they going through, as well as me tryna figure it out myself
Uh, you were telling me a little bit about, you know, just how you've struggled with anxiety over the years, do you feel like you touch on that a little bit on this album?
Yeah, I do touch on it
Mm-hm
I do, uhm, that's something that I feel like a lot of people neglect, which is completely and utterly wrong, and me speaking from an African-American man, I know that, that stuff is neglected in, like, our community, you know, you tell your mom or your dad or your auntie, whoever, that you feel like you got anxiety, or like you got depression, you fucking got ADD or whatever, they gon' look at you like you crazy
Mm-hm
Like, "You don't got that, get out, go, get out of here," like, how you gon' tell me I don't got something? You know, that's not how it should be, but that's how it is and that needs to change, and hopefully I'm one of those people that could bring, yeah, that change, or at least start a chain-reaction for somebody else to come and do it after meYou might also like7Embed
