10 ContributorsParking Lot Lyrics
You know the voice, you know the name nigga
DJ Holiday, Commission god, mixtape king, whatever you want to call me nigga
Just don't call me broke, I made a million off verbs and nouns
Yall know what the fuck man this nigga gon do when he get back

All red Bentley with the shoes, what you lil' boys got to prove
Jimmy Choo belt bag and boots, and my glasses Jimmy Choo
Y'all young boys y'all better move, Gucci Mane got shooters too
Crayons how my diamonds do, and I'm sittin' on 22's
Smokin' like Snoop Lion, I'm not lyin', man we fuck with Snoop
Higher than a giant, I'm not lyin', Pee Wee past the booth
I treat this dough like food, I hula-hoop producer cut the soup
I got mad at the world so I said fuck the world and fuck the room
I cross the country, Jamal Crawford cross you over alley-oop
A private plane with Gucci Mane, these hoes high as the altitude
RIP to Eazy-E cause them boys was my favorite crew
RIP to Pimp C, cause UGK still my favorite group

Hi my name is Gucci, AKA its Big Guwop
I'm a heavy drinker, yeah I drink codeine a lot
I'm a heavy smoker, yeah I pile green a lot
Yeah I like to gamble, I be out  in Liv a lot
I just wanna ball, I be in the mall a lot
I just wanna stunt, I just killed the parking lot
Ball, ballin', ball, I just wanna stunt a lot
I just kept the mall, I shed down the parking lot
You might also like
Mack a hoe and turn her out, work her from the parking lot
Give her all she ever need, I see you around the clock
Never let her tell me no, keep her on that main track
Baby got that bang bang, My nigga Gucci Mane back
Makin' money, talkin' shit, is all a nigga wanna do
Plenty bitches in the club, waitin' to see what I'ma do
Roll it up, and pour it out, drink that shit until it fall
Don't matter, smoke shatter, blowin' money at the mall
Cake batter, hundred stacks
We just making flapjacks
If we blow it all, don't matter my nigga
We gon' make that shit right back
Floatin' like a submarine
Flying like a G6
Gucci called the Lion, cause he know I keep that G-shit

Hi my name is Gucci, AKA its Big Guwop
I'm a heavy drinker, yeah I drink codeine a lot
I'm a heavy smoker, yeah I pile green a lot
Yeah I like to gamble, I be out in Liv a lot
I just wanna ball, I be in the mall a lot
I just wanna stunt, I just killed the parking lot
Ball, ball, ball, I just wanna stunt a lot
I just kept the mall, I shed down the parking lot
Thank y'all for comin' out, god bless
Good night, DJ Holiday Guwap
I know you missed this shit
I appreciate each and everyone of y'all for ridin' with the team, nigga
We gone live forever, Zone 6 forever nigga, East Atlanta forever
My nigga Guwop is a god nigga, and I'm a king
We kill 'em2Embed
