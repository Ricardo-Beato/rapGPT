That bando music
Trap shit
Narcotics
This for my niggas in the trap selling...

Contraband, contraband, contraband
Contraband, contraband, contraband
Trap house, it don't even matter, or the bando, everybody cook it up
Contraband
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Dope boys right now on the block
Running up numbers, young nigga don't need a wallet

Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy
When a nigga growed up, wanna be a dope boy (contraband)
Mama bust in, caught me counting money
Said, "you better not be dealing that coke, boy!" (mama!)
Got caught up in breaking in houses
First time a young nigga seen 1000
Then I went and copped my Audi
Then I had a meeting with a plug on a mountain (plug)
The plug start frowning
'Cause I needed 1000 ounces
"Why you needed 1000 ounces?"
'Cause my young nigga finna go snatch 'em
Plug, I attack 'em
Calling the plug for ransom
Rich nigga pull up in Phantoms
Trapping the nicks, flipping them nicks
Young nigga, I'm walking with cannons
My bitch got the dope in her panties (bitch)
You too dramatic (dramatic)
All of my niggas go money savage (money)
Bricks in the Hummer, it's automatic
You might also like
Contraband, contraband, contraband
Contraband, contraband, contraband
Trap house, it don't even matter, or the bando, everybody cook it up
Contraband (Offset!)
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Dope boys right now on the block
Running up numbers, young nigga don't need a wallet

Contraband, contraband, contraband
Take down one hundred birds, I'm a country man
The plug is talking Español, I understand
Throwing a brick like Randall Cunningham
J's they love me 'cause I got good customer service
I live in the trap so sometimes I be nervous
Get rich or die trying like Curtis
The trap concession stand, get you a Slurpee
You obviously never been in a trap (never ever)
We shortage you, you ain't get money back (shortage you)
Beating the pot Mortal Kombat, Jax (beat it)
Brick big as hell, hit it with the axe
The gas is reeking and you need some Axe (gas)
The stove don't work just use a match
I'm fucking your bitch, she a nat-nat (smash)
Two door Panamera, got a hatchback
Customer, customer, I am a hustler (customer)
I got candy, Reese's Buttercup
Offset is worth 10 million plus (Offset)
Touch down the plug, then drop a rope
Contraband, contraband, contraband
Contraband, contraband, contraband
Trap house, it don't even matter, or the bando, everybody cook it up
Contraband
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Dope boys right now on the block
Running up numbers, young nigga don't need a wallet

Contraband, contraband, contraband (narcotic, narcotic, narcotic)
Contraband, contraband, contraband (narcotic), contraband
Smoking OG's from Afghanistan (gas)
I got the candy, they call me the Candy-Man (I got it)
Bands can't fit in a rubber band
No football, I'm walking with thigh pads (touchdown)
Baking soda with the water
Stove on, throw the dope in a frying pan
Pick up the spatula, I'm the ambassador
Audi R8 creepin', like a tarantula (Audi)
Making moves, spectacular
Beating the dope with the stick and it's magical (beat it)
I set the block off and it's epical (set it off)
Bank of America, walking register
Can’t fuck wit you niggas, too skeptical
Undercover, you work with the federals (huh?)
OG gas bags and it's medical (gas)
Work in my bando, got cookies, they edible (Bando!)
Stretching the work, it's incredible
Pull up on the plug so I can go pick up some
Contraband, contraband, contraband
Contraband, contraband, contraband
Trap house, it don't even matter, or the bando, everybody cook it up
Contraband
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Dope boys right now on the block
Running up numbers, young nigga don't need a wallet6Embed
