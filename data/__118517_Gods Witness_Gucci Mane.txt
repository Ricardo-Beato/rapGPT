19 ContributorsGods Witness Lyrics
I was born legendary on the 12th of February
Big fat rich nigga, call me Refrigerator Perry
If I piss on your head then call it rain, do you believe it?
And your girl's a freak and I’ma leak it, I can’t keep a secret (Fuck It)
40 thou, chillin' out, under my PosturePedic mattress
Look at me now, iced out, damn I can fuck an actress
40 thou for a brick now and that's not even taxin
Turn my spot to a lean house, all I drink is Activis
And I ain’t even gotta flex to you bitch, I’m rich
Got the whole wide world shawty on my dick
Go tell your hot mouth ho she can suck my dick
I blow my nose with money ho, I’m snot nose rich
6’s on my chargers so I’m dodging potholes ho
Your nigga lost cuz he got on a Movado watch
And spill the sauce, bitch it ain’t a car that I ain’t got
Your nigga lost it but Gucci 'bout to lose his top
She found it sexy that every problem I got I address it
These niggas flexin', I pistol whip the boy that bring the message
Police interrogate me, man fuck the shit, am I arrested?
If not then let me go cuz bitch I got a show in Texas
Black nigga but I gotta stab like I’m Mexican
And I'mma hit your next of kin if I don’t have my Benjamins
Popped two mollies and it boosted my adrenaline
And your baby mama say my nuts taste like cinnamon
You might also like
I pull up in a Bentley and I give they ass the business
Tractor trailer full of midget, nigga come and get it
Nigga you know all the cash I made on I-20
God can be my witness, I’m a real trap nigga
Pull up in the Bentley and I give they ass the business
I’m servin' by myself cuz I don’t need no co-defendant
Hand countin the money lost count at 560
Cartel wanna clip me cuz I intercept the shipment

I’ve been sellin' dope since a little boy, I ain’t have no choice
Two man operation but I ain’t have no voice
I ain’t have no Rolls Royce and I ain’t have no Porsche
But if you step on these Air Force Ones, then your ass gon' get jumped, son
Gotta Apologize to your granddaddy cuz I beat up your grandson
I’ve been jumpin out of that van boy, cuz I owe cash to the landlord
Say I whip the nigga with a pool stick, man Gucci Mane is no pool shark
All this diamonds sittin' on my chest baby, they turned me into a cold heart
You can jump in front of these bullets and act like you a Braveheart
Quick ticket to the graveyard, playin' hard but you fake heart
You with the won't bust a grape boys, mine kidnap and rape boys
Know the streets ain't safe boy, suggest you open that safe boy
You’ve been owing me since the 3rd nigga, and you don’t know it’s the 8 month
Like how your blood taste boy, cuz you lyin' to me in my face boy
Your dad say you’re a disgrace, mistake in the first place
Glock 40 on my waist, and I tote a pistol on the first date
I pull up in a Bentley and I give they ass the business
Tractor trailer full of midget, nigga come and get it
Nigga you know all the cash I made on I-20
God can be my witness, I’m a real trap nigga
Pull up in the Bentley and I give they ass the business
I’m servin' by myself cuz I don’t need no co-defendant
Hand countin the money lost count at 560
Cartel wanna clip me cuz I intercept the shipment4Embed
