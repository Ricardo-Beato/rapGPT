The same dust can't stay, I gotta clean or I can't think
Resort to cantankerous means on the cash play, rat races
The cheese sit in the trap, wait
It snap, then we break
Somethin' reachin' for me from the waist
These days, I'm mindful of what I embrace
Operating on an empty tank, spank me, fumes fueling a flame
My grandfather spoke thirteen languages
Somehow never had nothing to say to Boot Raymond
Sensed hazel, made sense of it through prayer
Booze is a fool's fragrance
Ipeleng, the glue that saved us
Through his brain getting chipped away at daily
His body on a road, where his mind flailing, funeral wailings
No beluga, no Bob, just mood swingin'
True pain, I couldn't eat or sleep for seven days
Maimed me, I ain't weak
Keep changing for the better, what to do when your job thankless
In the middle of the marsh where mosquitoes chomp ankles
Swamp marching on, on the quest for my lost halo, God (Lost halo, God)You might also likeEmbed
