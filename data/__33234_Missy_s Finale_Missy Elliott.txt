Yo, you have come almost to the close of my album
But before I go I just wanna thank God for staying with me
Through my ups and downs and through my whole period
Of doing this album
I want to thank Timbaland who came up with the beats and all the people that appeared on my album to
Make it hot, aight, I'm outYou might also likeEmbed
