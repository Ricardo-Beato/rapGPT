9 ContributorsMutron Angel Lyrics
In the eye of the storm
Looking out through the rain
Gabriel, blow your horn
They shield me from tsunamis and the hurricane

Gangsta ride right in the nick of time
Soul is 'Delfonic' then they'll blow your mind
Bold ass soldiers marching off to war
No idea what we in for
Powerful magnificent and so divine
Soul is 'Delfonic' it'll blow your mind

Hear a thunderous voice
Shouting there will be no peace
Until our people rejoice
When every boy and girl is freed
You see it's going down
The wars and the mysteries
But my friends there'll be better days
And a better way
According to the prophecy

It would be so nice
To hook up in paradise
By all means we must go
Or are you in the know
Like all the way up sunshine
You might also likeYou been a friend of mine

Gangsta ride right in the nick of time
Soul is 'Delfonic' then they'll blow your mind
Bold ass soldiers marching off to war
No idea what we in for
Powerful magnificent and so divine
Soul is 'Delfonic' it'll blow your mind
You been a friend of mine

It would be so nice
To hook up in paradise
By all means we must go
Or are you in the know
Like all the way up sunshine3Embed
