61 ContributorsHey, I Lyrics
Get it

I think she ready for a kiddy
She told me she gon' make me miss her
She let me wet her whole lil' ceiling
My dick like crack so yeah, I'm dealing
She gotta love him, Peter Griffin
Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin
I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish
I'm going down with her hard 'til her partition

Where the fuck you going, girl? I miss you
I wanna bang like a pistol
I wanna bang like a Crip do
I'm banging red like suu whoo, ooh
Brand new Rollie I'm living sporty
Flood you with gold like a trophy
She still the bomb, call her lotus
Hey, racks keep me up without Folger's
I'm up, I'm up
I might hit 'em with them bucks just in case he got luck
This a Crime Mob lifestyle nigga, knuck if you buck
Just 'cause I'm in New York with a puck
Don't mean you won't get stuck up, up
Ayy, I might just tell this ho my secrets
First I like them red like a demon
A purse, every time lil' momma catch me cheating
Starburst, I won't eat it unless she creamy
You might also like
I think she ready for a kiddy
She told me she gon' make me miss her
She let me wet her whole lil' ceiling
My dick like crack so yeah, I'm dealing
She gotta love him, Peter Griffin
Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin
I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish
I'm going down with her hard 'til her partition

I done completed my little mission
I put something in your stomach next to your kidney
I want nothing to do with none of these lil' bitches
I want something to do with everything and I'm willing
To go to church and ask God there for forgiveness
For everything and tell that preacher that I'm gon' remember
Him bringing you in my life and that's on my children
Fuck all them other hoes talking, they Wendy Williams
Now your wrist got ice like December
I pour out the paint like Mutumbo
I'm a fucking lion like Simba
And, yeah, my girl ballin' like Kendra

I think she ready for a kiddy
She told me she gon' make me miss her
She let me wear her whole lil' ceiling
My dick like crack so yeah, I'm dealing
She gotta love him, Peter Griffin
Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin
I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish
I'm going down with her hard 'til her partition17Embed
