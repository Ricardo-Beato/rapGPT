Hey
Microphone testing, uh, testing
You playin' politician, you Martin Sheen on The West Wing
Guessing the best thing for me to do is spit it
This shit is never a gimmick, you listen more than a minute
I been spittin' flows since the kid was six-years-old
And if you listen close, I do this like some mismatched clothes
It's whatever, put it together, you never could be this clever
I'm rockin' the mic forever, you gonna stop me never
I'm cocky because I love it, you Rocky without the punches
Hockey without the ice and boxes without the lunches
Flowin' like me, no one, and that got you mad, bitch
Saw your boys are nothin' but just a-verage
I ain't tellin' nobody how they should live they life
I got my own shit to deal with, so that just isn't right
I'm just tryna leave the crib, go out and live tonight
Shit, fuck that, I'm locked in the lab, workin'
Droppin' a track, beats get bodied and bagged, certain
See the world through first, second, and third-person
Omniscient, listenin' so efficient
Trapped in my own goal line, ready to go the distance
Consider it a privilege that you get to witness
History in the makin', you fuckin' bitches
Haha, just playin' witcha'll
Still in line waitin' for my name to get called, yuhYou might also likeEmbed
