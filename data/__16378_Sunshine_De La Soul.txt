(LET IT FLOW!)

And yes y'all
You are about to bear witness
From the lands of Long Island
Takin' you into the sky's survival
I am your captain, Enola
On this endless joruney
To invisions, to broaden your outer visions
To where you never been before
It's just a one night trip to love
Sun shinin' forever, and forever sun shines

Yo, leaving lasting impressions like cuts to flesh
Be that crew from the five one six point of view
With skills so tight, they the rhymes of a vagina
Them clits will turn into a diamond, the level of rhymin'
Pressure comes from lesser forms than me and my man
And we go back like life created from um, specks of sand
And there's money to be made cause Caucasians are paid
Only brothers who rhyme, seek bounce and catch balls
Plug 1, with them rhymes makin' your heart stall
Like them girls when you in they room when they man calls
It ain't nothin' but the thing Wonder Why can bring
As we come to bring the pain, everyone will sing
You might also like
De La is the crew that you must hear
But please don't rush the stage
'Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies, because

I'm onto travellin' to places that the eye can't see
But kinder, 'cause yo' strife don't mean a thing to me
Throwin' me criminal looks, y'all need to get in the books
And drop some water in your melon, 'stead of actin' like a felon
Ayo son, who you tellin'? I'd make a mil if it was up to me
But since it ain't, I teach my seed to bank hard
And thank God, I smoke a substance of a different kind
Catch me trippin' on earth when I'm high, sunshine

Down right to dirt, Wonder Why makes it work
With access to talent like Caucasians to yellow cabs with an Arab driver
I liven parties with marvellous conviction
Ain't no fiction when life claims them victims who be  some dried the funds
Best believe that the life is strife
'Cause the gun made a man outta pussies from around my way
Who usually wouldn't have a fuckin' thing to say
Last year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders
And L.I.'s finest is movin' yo' necks and shoulders
The anthem of this guy has a place in yo' eye
So you can be blessed to see in 3D double-E
De La is the crew that you must hear
But please don't rush the stage
'Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies, because

Yo, when I first heard 3 Feet High and Rising, I was-2Embed
