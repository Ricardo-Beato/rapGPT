28 Contributors2 Much Lyrics
I say these hoes ain't shit, I ain't trippin' on a thot
I don't like conversations, is you gon' let me fuck or not?
While these niggas sneak dissin', I be tourin' gettin' guap
I be flexin' on these suckas, pullin' up in foreign drops
These hoes say I'm too much, I think I'm too much
Nigga try Almighty Sosa, he get touched
These hoes be tryin' too much, doin' too much
Bitch, I couldn't call your phone, I was doin' too much

They say I smoke too much, Lean too much
T-Roy my shooter and he'll shoot ya
I put Tadoe in the cut, Fredo was in it too much
If you ain't on that opp shit, then we salute ya
I get money too much, spend it too much
And if you try to take it, then my niggas shoot ya
When I throw it in the air these hoes be doin' too much
When we leave it be too many hoes up on the tour bus
I just got Kay Kay check we finna hit Toys 'R' Us
Spent 20 thousand dollars, think I bought her too much
I just got Kay Kay check, finna hit Toys 'R' Us
I spent 20 thousand dollars, think I bought her too much

I say these hoes ain't shit, I ain't trippin' on a thot
I don't like conversations, is you gon' let me fuck or not?
While these niggas sneak dissin', I be tourin' gettin' guap
I be flexin' on these suckas, pullin' up in foreign drops
These hoes say I'm too much, I think I'm too much
Nigga try Almighty Sosa, he get touched
These hoes be tryin' too much, doin' too much
Bitch, I couldn't call your phone, I was doin' too muchYou might also like13Embed
