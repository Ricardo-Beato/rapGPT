Bang

Bitch I was born to flex (skrt), I am gonna flex (skrt skrt)
Put it up on my set (on my set), I am gonna flex (flex)
I still carry my Tec (my Tec) and I am gonna blow that (blow that, bang bang, dududuh)
Nigga try to flex (flex), act like he ain't know that (click-clack, dududuh, he ain't know dat)
Me plus my gat (dududuh), that equals your death (dududuh duh)
I'm smoking this pack (dududuh), got me so there (dududuh)
Cops knocking on my door, no he is not there (dududuh, ayy, ayy)
Bitch you can't be with me, be with yourself (huh)

This bitch got me fucked up, fuck, ayy
Come through, shootin' shit right up, buck
Pussy boy see us, duck
Niggas know what to us, nuthin'
Hop in the whip, I press buttons
She ain't tryna top me, press the eject button, ayy
I hope that she ain't left nothing
'Cause I'm takin' off in this car, paid a jet buddy, ayy
Flexing hard and throwin' sets, buddy, ayy
You flex, we shoot your chest buddy, ayy
AK with a knife, this bitch comin'
Ain't got time for hoes but I fucked a ship of hoes at 6 something
I want extra something, I flex over the night
Come through scaring shit bitch, Poultergeist
He sneak dissin' the Glo, he must not want his life
We send shots for free, holidays and overnights
