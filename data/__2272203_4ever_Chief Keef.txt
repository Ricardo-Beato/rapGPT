Forever (ProtegeBeatz)
Forever

I'ma be that nigga forever (Forever)
Forever (Forever)
Forever (Forever)
Forever (Forever)
I'ma be that nigga forever, I'ma be that nigga forever
I'm gon' be that nigga forever, I'ma be that nigga forever
I'm gon' be that nigga forever

Niggas be like, "When I see Sosa, I'ma treat that nigga, on everything"
But niggas don't be on a damn thing
Niggas ain't even icy as my damn chain
Smoke so many trees, wonder what my breath like
But I be shinin' bright like a damn light
Bitches be like, "He ain't shit, girl," baby girl, you damn right
'Cause these thotties going any damn way
Unlike me, you can't do it any better
I'ma do this shit in any weather
And I bet I'll have your bitch followin' my campaign
Try me, guns be like an M, man
'Cause it got two twelves when I'm done blowing, bang
Let me catch a nigga from the low end, bang
Let me catch a nigga from Insane
He gon' be on it for the summer, right along with Ben Frank

I'ma be that nigga forever (Forever)
Forever (Forever)
Forever (Forever)
Forever (Forever)
I'ma be that nigga forever, I'ma be that nigga forever
I'm gon' be that nigga forever, I'ma be that nigga forever
I'm gon' be that nigga forever1Embed
