12 ContributorsGet My Pistol Lyrics
This ain't hip hop
This Guwop

If I ever go broke again
If I ever go broke again
Imma I’m a go get my muthafukin pistol (haha)
If I ever go broke again 
Imma go and get my pistol
Get my muthafuckin pistol

I make a nigga call 911
It be a muthafuckin 211
Don’t make it turn to a 187
I gotta mufuckin three five seven
I’m from thirty-two thirty-four Gresham
I was twelve with a three eight special
I got fifty grand on me im special
Hood millionaire bitch I’m successful
I was born in 1980 12th February
I’m shootin guns like the first of the year
I got them bottles on fire like the fourth of july
And on the first imma pay me some bills
And when her check come she buyin some pills
Twenty 24 karat gold in my grill
30 inch rims yea them my wheels
And these suckas kinda thick boy these things ain’t real
You might also like
If I ever go broke again
If I ever go broke again
Imma I’m a go get my muthafukin pistol (haha)
If I ever go broke again 
Imma go and get my pistol
Get my muthafuckin pistol

Italian leather on my back
Same shit hanging off of my ass
Christian Loub cost 2k
So that’s 5 thousand for the whole fit
Keep them shooters round with them F&Ns and them red beams and they don’t miss shit
Pulled up in that black Ghost and I jumped out and I pop shit
Quarter Mill on ice nigga my neck, ears and my wrist lit
It was time dawg when I was fucked up nobody wouldn’t give a nigga shit
So pulled up in that foreign thang niggas already know not to ask for shit
You can look at them and tell they havin problems
You can look at me and tell I’m havin paper
Bitch Im from the westside where we take money and pull paper
When it’s bout that check nigga we mad  and turn to home invaders
Desert eagle go across ya head have ya shit drippin like activator
Desert eagle go across ya head have ya shit drippin like activator

If I ever go broke again
If I ever go broke again
Imma I’m a go get my muthafukin pistol (haha)
If I ever go broke again 
Imma go and get my pistol
Get my muthafuckin pistol
If I ever go broke againEmbed
