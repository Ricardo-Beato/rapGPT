Hope I see you (Yeah), tomorrow
I'm tryna see you (Jeffery), tomorrow (Uh)
(Yeah, I'm the black Christian Grey, you know what I'm sayin'?)
I wanna be you, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow (Yeah)
(I got fifty shades of baes with me, fifty different bitches)
I wanna see you (Yeah), I wanna see you
I'ma see you (Ooh-ooh-ooh), tomorrow
Ooh, I'ma see you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, tomorrow), can't wait to see you
Ooh, I'ma see you, tomorrow (Go)

I know you ride, you ride, you ride (Ah)
I got three bitches down to slide (Woah)
I put some Forgis on my ride (Skrt, skrt)
Me and my dawgs headed to the sky (Pew)
Cloud nine calling me, couple bad bitches, too
I got money on me, listening to "Digits", ooh (Hey)
Feet up, baby girl, let's live (Uh, uh)
PJ money, yeah, Bentley's gonna deliver, mm (Money)
Two racks for my shoes (Shoes, uh), my Jimmy Choos (Woah)
My bitch Chanel (Bitch Chanel), pity the fool (Mm)
I got Chanel on my socks (Ayy), silky Versace her crotch (Ayy)
Ben and Jerry (Ooh), boutta eat her ice cream (Slurp)
I came from pillar to post, ice in my bag, my back on froze (Damn)
Penthouse home, Chicago (On God), yeah, that my second home (Oh)

I got my money now, tat my ribs, Hillstone (Yeah)
You might also like
I just wanna see tomorrow
I'm tryna see tomorrow
Mm, let's fly away, long time, ain't late
I was speed racing

I know you ride, you ride, you ride
But I'm tired of try-ry-rying
No matter what, you gotta stay by my side
Right or wrong, you better ride or die
'Til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity
'Til infinity, ride, ride, ride, 'til infinity, ooh

I'm about to buy you your own ride
I don't need you involved in homicides
Got this weed from Texas you think you fried (Uh)
I'm 'bout to fuck this ho outside (Uh)
Horses make my three-wheeler slide
Actavis gang 'til I (Yeah) die
Charged me with RICO, oh
Gangbangers, charged me with RICO, woah
Hold up, money is the reason I arrived
Bitch, I keep a knife like Michael Myers
I was boutta stab 'em thirty times like porcupines
And I got rainbow diamonds on like Mike 'n' Ikes
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah

I know you ride, ride, ride
But I'm tired of try-y-ying
No matter what, you gotta stay by my side
Right or wrong, you better ride or die
'Til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity
'Til infinity, ride, ride, ride, 'til infinity, infinity, ooh, infinity

I wanna see you, tomorrow
I'm tryna see you, tomorrow, yeah
I'm tryna see you, tomorrow
Oh, oh, tomorrow17Embed
