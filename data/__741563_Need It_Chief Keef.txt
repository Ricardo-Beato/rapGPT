DP Beats
I'm weeded
No stressing, girl, nada, I'm weeded, ayy
Yeah, that's cool, ayy
Yeah, that's cool
I fucked her on top of Temp'
Bang, bang

I fucked her on top of Tempur-Pedic (Tempur-Pedic)
Tryna stress me girl, nada, I don't need it (I don't need it)
No stressing, no nada, I'm weeded
Interest me, if not, I won't believe it (DP on the beat)
I fucked her on top of Tempur-Pedic (Tempur-Pedic)
Tryna'stress me, girl, nada, I don't need it
No stressing, no nada, I'm weeded
Interest me, if not, I won't believe it

He flexin' like I'm not, I don't believe it
Check out my watch, check out his watch, is his teeny?
These lessons I'm teaching, they taught me it
My God blessed me, I'm flexing, walking it

Pull up for that money, I'm walking it
Pulled your thot, I catch her, I'm freezin' (Get your thot)
I live this, no, I'm not talking it (Nah, I don't talk)
That money, yeah, I be stalking it (That cash I stalk)
Got your bitch at midnight, freezin' (I froze your ho)
Pull up with your heat if you are with it (You with the war)
Please do not IG or tweet it (Don't tweet it, no)
The feds watching, I do no snitchin' (No snitchin', no)
I spend money, I do no bitchin' (No bitchin', no)
I make money, I use no kitchens (No kitchens, no)
Niggas washed up and I'll do those dishes (I'll do those dishes though)
I'm topped up and I need more attention (I need more attention)
That thot, I fucked her, she's in love (She's in love)
She's like, "Know Chief Keef? He's a drug" (Drug)
Cops like, "Know Chief Keef? He's a thug" (A thug)
Niggas like, "Chief Keef? No, he's a scrub" (A scrub)
But I'm countin' benjis, no bucks (No bucks)
And thots, I'm fuckin' plenty, so what? (So what?)
I be like, "You gon' let me in them panties or what?" (Them panties or what?)
Is you with me just like Wendy or what? (Wendy or what?)
You might also like
I fucked her on top of Tempur-Pedic (Tempur-Pedic)
Tryna stress me girl, nada, I don't need it (I don't need it)
No stressing, no nada, I'm weeded
Interest me, if not, I won't believe it
I fucked her on top of Tempur-Pedic (Tempur-Pedic)
Tryna'stress me, girl, nada, I don't need it
No stressing, no nada, I'm weeded
Interest me, if not, I won't believe it

He flexin' like I'm not, I don't believe it
Check out my watch, check out his watch, is his teeny?
These lessons I'm teaching, they taught me it
My God blessed me, I'm flexing, walking it3Embed
