5 ContributorsIâ€™m Gonna Win LyricsI'm gonna win
I'm a winner
I'm gonna win
No matter how hard I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna win
It don't matter what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna win
They do it all
I'm a leader
I'm a show you
I'm gonna win
Nowadays test just passed
You can test it
I'm a dog
I still ride for it
It ain't about how you talk to me
It's about how I talk to you
It seems to me I am cool
Nigga what that do?
I move how I'm moving
I step where I'm stepping
Walk where I'm walking
With  and a weapon
You niggas rippin' corners
Talk but don't mind
Honestly, don't want to see them dead
Somebody better watch
Honestly we don't do what we do
Bum, bum, bum
Come on dog I show them how I do this big shit
The first lie that I can't do this shit
I'm a win this shit
No matter how hard it gets
I love how it gets
No matter how hard I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna win
It don't matter what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna win
They do it all
I'm a leader
I'm a show you
I'm gonna win
And this movie made something shit
I saw that
I'm a keep that
Get your ass nigga
Get your sneaky ass nigga
The ladies wnana be jealous
What the fuck nigga?
I'm out here
Get out in the dark
Anytime you fuck your bitches
Think the way it's done
When you see it
Don't hate the hood
Check it
Move niggas
Where's the good?
I'll go with my dick out
This is the hood
This is the hood
I just walk around like I hooked it on
We like I wish they wouldn't
Niggas ride it like the dawn
What that do?
Oh no the tears we both know what that do
Pop them, dress them and just burry them
No matter how hard I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna win
It don't matter what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna win
They do it all
I'm a leader
I'm a show you
I'm gonna winYou might also likeEmbed
