11 ContributorsHolla @ Chaâ€™ Boy Lyrics
I knew you niggas would be back
See, see, you need to fuck with me y'nahmean
Yeah, you need to holla at your boy man, holla
Stop fuckin' with them punk-niggas man with that shit
That's what you get, that shit stepped on nigga, that's what you get
I got that raw, I got that, ungh

Twenty-fo' seven, holla at your boy
What you need baby, c'mon with it, holla at your boy
I got it all day, in the hallway, holla at your boy
Sick of that blow up, holla at your boy

That's what you get for fuckin' with them niggas
Come and see me for that real O.G
He a O-Z, I'm a whole ki'
Dope as a motherfucker, son a whole seed
Bitches fiend for it, then they lean for it
It ain't cocaine, but they wanna still blow it
What you need, what you need
Hoes offer me the pink slip and the deed (yes indeed)
Treat it just like weed, hit the right end then pass it to her friend
I'm a hustler, you a customer
Them other niggas you like, straight fuckin' ya
Some of 'em lyin (yup) most of 'em trickin
Others are dyin, some of 'em victims
When you come from South Central L.A
That shit is like dirt weed, a nigga got a headache (holla)
You might also like
If you want it raw now, make the call now
Look me up nigga, holla at your boy
Fiendin for that good shit, take a look bitch
What you need baby, holla at your boy
I got it all day, in the hallway
On Broadway, holla at your boy
Sick of that blow up, gettin' stepped on
Nigga come on home, holla at your boy

"Ice Cube", back then they used to fuck me
Now that I'm hot these bitches still love me
Why, cause I'm far from ugly
Everywhere I go they wanna kiss and hug me
They say, dopeman, dopeman
I got your money don't turn into Conan
Don't wanna see the g-hand, bitch
I am the man from here to Cleveland
Don't get mad, I get e-van
Try to shake the van, think you're sleep-an
Oh my God this nigga's leak-in
Somebody best to call the deacon, uh-huh
Any dose is a overdose
Leave your punk-ass dead or a comatose
And if you don't wanna listen
My shit'll crack you out like Tyrone Bigguns

Holla, yeah
But don't two-way a nigga
Bitch that ain't nothin' but a transcript
Dumb bitch, I'll holla
Don't two-way a nigga man, I'll holla
Damn


20 years I've been servin you fiends for 20 years
Why would you fuck with anybody else, huh
That's why you're fucked up right now, ain't it
You need to get at me, you know I got it, and I know you want it
Holla at your boy

C'mon Cube let me rap on here
I'm, I'm just tryin to sack somethin' up1Embed
