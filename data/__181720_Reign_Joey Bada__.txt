60 ContributorsReign Lyrics
When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do
When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do

Adapted to these new ways of living, getting money and sinning
Go together like denims diamonds and women
Tryna balance it at once but keep hitting these blunts
Demons of lust, keep hinting they stunts when I'm drunk
What if I jumped off this cloud full of thinking aloud
Into a, pool of my sorrow and start sinking in doubt
Rethinking it out, 'cause tomorrow ain't ever promising
And ever blink it counts for a prophet who see deposits
But he ain't always see the positives
He used to live in poverty, Thinking probably
One day, he strike the lottery
'Cause dreaming big never been odd to me
And since a kid Ive been on a musical odyssey
I knew the day would come where I wouldn't be sorry in a pile of G's
Or probably be rehearsing a verse on the beach
Wait reverse in the speech
'Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly
You might also like
When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do

I turn my dreams to reality
So, I burn green same time I burn calories though
I'm eating now in fact, I'm feasting now
No more mistreating, my miss is treated now
No more misleading mister leader now
Mister visa now, I got green and cards with no limits
Bad boy life but shyne with no diddy
But it's no biggie, I spread love the Brooklyn way
But when push come to shove I'm bout that Crooklyn wave
Shook for days, Don't ever judge a book by a page
That could be a cover up if you ain't looking that way
But what can I say, everything happens for a reason
Time will tell 'cause even fall lasts for a season
So keep on believing, you live and learn die and you teach
Another, piece of the pie and it's finally sweet
But reverse on the speech, 'cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly

When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do
Said we done came a long way 365 bong rips later
Last year I ain't make no paper
All I earned was some kicks some snares from some haters
And some favors from some chicks that move there rumps like shakers
But what's that shit, I was tryna be the greatest
Upgrade to the grade A list, but all they do is degrade us
And it ain't to hard to be famous, Whats hard is sustaining
Remaining the same when stuff changing
'Cause I remember days at the bus station, waiting
Still had no patience, so niggas try to play him
Imaginary players, Imaginary playlist
I been your favorite before you even started playing it
Who’d of thought the day would come I wouldn’t be sorry
In a pile of g's, and rehearse a verse on the beach
But reverse on the speech
'Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly

When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do
