2 ContributorsBig Dog Status Lyrics
Young 'Face slangin' yay every day
Heavyweight, got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind nonstop 'til I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas, stay the fuck up out my way
I be true OG, you can quote what I say
I'm a H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, ridin' dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I don't gangbang, I control the game
What I'm representin' here is puttin' holes in brains
Oh, I'll say the same thing, I'll be old and gray
'Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Grippin' grain, poppin' trunks, dawg, that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in '83
I stay street, when it's done, that's that
You can find me in your hood pumpin' monster crack
I roll over rodents and Rovers with rims on 'em
Sniffing out a rat, I expose them and then dome 'em
A lotta niggas bitches that claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy that claims that he knows me
A C.I. puttin' out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets, he gots to squat to pee
Got the feds on his team, so they watchin' me
Mouse trap for a rat, pussy, watch and see
You might also like
I've been straight for a long time
Gettin' cake for a long time
Me and J for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
Been a G for a long time
In the streets for a long time
Totin' heat for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
I got big dog status, I got big dog status
I got big dog status, I got big dog status
I got big dog status, I got big dog status
I got big dog status, I got big dog status

I came here to exercise my game
Spread love to the hood is how I do my thang
Smoke weed with my homies, barbecue them wings
Sip Hennessy and Coke 'cause I don't fuck with drank
Don't pop pills either 'cause that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a Mad Dog before we went to school
Clique up back then, I was smashing boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
'Cause if I slap one ho, then her man was next
I'm a kick-door robber, a hot-shot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If it's there to be made, then I'm finna make it
But if it ain't no way, then believe I'm finna take it
'Cause a nigga with no hustle in him worthless, Jack
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
I've been good at bullshittin' but this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain, mayne, he lost
He a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail, I heard
And as a nigga, I come in here with my balls and my word, word
I've been straight for a long time
Gettin' cake for a long time
Me and J for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
Been a G for a long time
In the streets for a long time
Totin' heat for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
I got big dog status, I got big dog status
I got big dog status, I got big dog status
I got big dog status, I got big dog status
I got big dog status, I got big dog status

Now the subject of this story is about these boys
Runnin' 'round talkin' 'bout how they ride these cars
I was sitting in the Benz at the age of 19
When I was 21, I had a yellow Ferrari
22, I was Porsche'in' with the top let back
23 in a Rolls with the pipe to match
24, I wasn't trippin' what I came up in
I was focusing on how to be like James back then
Money, power and respect was the life I chose
Being famous wasn't nothin', I just liked my dough
I was livin' in the fast lane, mayne, for sho'
Short temper, quick to up and let this thing unload
So if I had a problem with you, you to blame, you know
Saw the message and then this nigga's brain explodes
So if you see a nigga, holla at me passin' by
Chunk the deuce when I leave and don't be askin' why
I've been straight for a long time
Gettin' cake for a long time
Me and J for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
Been a G for a long time
In the streets for a long time
Totin' heat for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
I got big dog status, I got big dog status
I got big dog status, I got big dog status
I got big dog status, I got big dog status
I got big dog status, I got big dog statusEmbed
