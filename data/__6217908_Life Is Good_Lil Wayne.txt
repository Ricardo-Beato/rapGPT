44 ContributorsLife Is Good Lyrics

Working while they sleeping as usual
Percocets, I eat them like chewables
These niggas think they passed up, they think too much
If these niggas get too gassed up, I bring a few pumps
Yeah, Hershey chocolate candy skin, she ate all my nuts
Yeah, wifey caught me slipping once, okay, more than once
Yeah, we don't hit your block up, we blow that bitch up
Cappin', talkin' big shit until that shit don't flush
Yeah, they say my days are numbered, but I keep taking drugs
Baby, I know you see these X pills, pleasе take one
I'm a skater but I hеard your man a cheapskate, huh
Heard he rattin', now they moving his release date, huh, snitch
I just turned my main to my spouse
Could've bought her ass the tote purse or pouch, bought a house
Now baby got an ego twice the size of the crib
Now she see what I'm saying, she got eyes in her ears
Never turn your back on Weezy F B, God forbid
I might have to do a bid if she left me, I forgive
Twerkin', got a fatty in this bitch, doing butt flips
Way she roll her hips make her body look like Sunchips
Working out my demons, that's beautiful
And bae off of that riesling, she super loose
I'm smokin', she say pass it, she doing too much
Haven't done my taxes, fuckin' with Trump
She brought her skirt without the panties with the slit going up
Nigga caught you looking at it, it's okay, don't touch
Uh, someone bought the block up in Bel-Air, it was us
Check the clock and hit the shot, I swear this shit too clutch

Three hundred shots, let the sweeper ring
'Til I don't feel my fingers, lil' bitch, pewm
Chicken pox on my trigger finger
How my trigger finger still itch, pewm

Copped three watches at the same time
Nigga, we are not on the same time
Shoulder strap on the strap, hangtime
Got the 40 on me like St. Ides
Granny, she was standing right there
Mercedes car, they call her Mrs. Mercy
Ever since the day I got her name tatted on my face, I been picture perfect
Taliban, nigga, ISIS, hand to hand, switching prices
Been dapper dan since the diaper, a gat, a bag, and a Bible
Young Obama go dumb, Osama
Hit him with the llama, he do the la bamba
Trade the private jet for an F1 bomber
We could go to war like it's the Bahamas
Lied to my hoes, never to my mama
Never tell my woes, lie to your honor
Money long though, nigga, anaconda
Let me add a comma
I'm way too high for niggas at the bottom
You a ladder climber
I'm the best rapper, nigga, that's the obvious
Got punchlines for you shadowboxers
You a kitty cat, I'm catastrophic
Rex 'bout to turn up, call up Roger
New fettuccine, new lasagna
Diamonds blinging so new they blind you
Diamonds sing like Ja Rule and Mya, No Ceilings
Three hundred shots, let the sweeper ring
'Til I don't feel my fingers, lil' bitch, pewm
Chicken pox on my trigger finger
How my trigger finger still itch, pewm
Three hundred shots, let the sweeper ring
'Til I don't feel my fingers, lil' bitch, pewm
Chicken pox on my trigger finger
How my trigger finger still itch, pewm3Embed
