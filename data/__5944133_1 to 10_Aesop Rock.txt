18 Contributors1 to 10 Lyrics
Bad back, bad back, bad back
One half zig while the other half zag
Stand too long and the whole shit hunch
Sit too long and I can't stand up
Gramps out for a Sunday drive
A man as betrayed by his lumbar spine
Who pull up to the spot like, "I'll meet y'all inside
I need like five"
Corpse pose, staring at the moon
Entirely on fire, Sciatica to boot
I'm ready to be turned into soup
Or shot into space, or squashed into cubes
"Rate your pain level on a scale from one to ten"
I said, "Well doc, I tell you, I feel like I lost a friend"
I'm usually okay to simply shut up and cope
But these days more than ever, my back is like, "Nope"You might also likeEmbed
