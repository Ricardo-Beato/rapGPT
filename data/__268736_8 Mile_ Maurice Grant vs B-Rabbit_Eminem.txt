19 Contributors8 Mile: Maurice Grant vs B-Rabbit Lyrics
The Shelter
Let me get up in this nigga like smashin'
With a red beam, Johnny blastin'
Evil is the rhyme assassin
Get a guy done, runnin' like haulin' ass and
Bury you pink rabbits for askin'
Closed caption, nigga, don't say a word
When these flames get to burnin' up, burnin' you down
Leavin' your frown tore up, full of pressure, wanna frown?
You don't want to will a nigga known for pullin' triggers
Hoist this fool on my neck, back-break this nigga

Yo
Check it out
Look, look
Yo, I gotta flow
I'm from the Mo, you ain't Detroit, hoe
Talkin' about "7 Mile," change your style
I read your bio, you're really from Ohio
I'm vile
This guy's so fuckin' fat, I can't even see his eyes when he smiles
Yo, listen to this
Motherfuckin' rhyme, yo, chicken, we can do this
As a matter of fact have another beer
I'll be right back, dawg, I'ma set the mic right hereYou might also like4Embed
