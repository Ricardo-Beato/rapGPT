1 ContributorLost Souls  (Best Buy Bonus Track) Lyrics
'Cause I hate to spend
My life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time! (Lost Soul)
How it start? How it start?

Started off with, runnin' from coppers
Duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us?
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' 25 to life, if the judge don't like us
Am I clear as pictures? I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF, state feds, scandalous bitches
How was it promised to us? Was it bitter or sweet?
See if a, nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat
On these streets livin' do or die, circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for G's
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin' Thug Life, comin' equipped, with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time; stranded in the county in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost souls...
Lost souls, nigga, for my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a lost soul
You might also like
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Roll wit' it, nigga; roll wit' it, nigga

Look look, hey Pac
This is young 
There's a whole lotta niggas out here living their life through you
You an inspiration to the next generation
The men and women soldiers, a number of lieutenants who gonna be generals just like you
I seen a few from the peoples armies and make it do what it do
I learnt it from the best
From to Liana to 
To Dr. Shakur, who prepared me for war
We just want peace, until my people get a piece
We slayin' the beast, and celebratin' with a feast
For all of y'all, kickin' y'all in hell
Just to see ya smile and enjoy yourself
As the goal I put it up there next to my freedom
And say we up to no good, but you can't believe them
They call us "Lost souls" but we been stranded in time
Remember happiness is all in the mind, we on the grind

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
One time, one time, one time
Imagine a team like me destroyed
Beatin' motherfuckers unborn
When the verse support
How can Deads
When the guns blow
And the summer times show
You already know, never show
I replenish the name
This 2Pac motherfucker, y'all remember the name
Makaveli & Dillinger, the First 2 Bomb (So don't sleep homeboy)
Hey, just like the M.O.B., money over bitches
The rule that I live by, got on the jeans, pattern leathers
You know that I'ma stay fly
Who can't understand the power that I gain
It's tryna stop up over me
You runnin' over like a 
Shining like a diamond, you know who I are
Imagine to keep on, wishin' up on the star
I break they ass with a 6 AR-K
And then out with the pay, soon count up the pie

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time
All of y'all, keeping y'all in health
All of y'all, keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all of y'all, keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
It's for all my dogs, keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself...Embed
