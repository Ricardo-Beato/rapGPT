13 ContributorsCoolinâ€™ Lyrics
Cut the top of the Lamborghini, coolin'
Got to juug overseas I'm bout to pursue it
Got your bitch and her friend makin' movies
Keep the money in the wall, can't find the toolie
Cop the money everyday, wake up
Whip, whip, whip, whip, time to shake it up
Microwave it, watch it cool, bake it up
Me and BMG we always flexed up

When it comes to them bands I need mine off top
Then I go to the dealer then I cop a new drop
Nigga the watch you can't see the time because of big rocks
Get the money make it flip and stretch it out like botox
Now my pockets lookin' fat like Norbit
Bitch watchin' me you need a camera to record me
Too much money on me they just put me on the fortune list
Your bitch choosin' me now she cumming that's unfortunate
I do the shit

Cut the top of the Lamborghini, coolin'
Got to juug overseas I'm bout to pursue it
Got your bitch and her friend makin' movies
Keep the money in the wall, can't find the toolie
Cop the money everyday, wake up
Whip, whip, whip, whip, time to shake it up
Microwave it, watch it cool, bake it up
Me and BMG we always flexed up
You might also like
Put the money in the machine and watch it do the numbers
Catch you sleepin' with that money like it was a slumber
No party, two foreign hoes in my Maserati
Black belts wrapped around my money like I know karate
Look-looking at money everyday like I can't see nobody
And I'm cuttin' that dip with white like my name was Rowdy
You can come and get the chickens if you want to
Cause you know we got them birds flyin' on the roof

Cut the top of the Lamborghini, coolin'
Got to juug overseas I'm bout to pursue it
Got your bitch and her friend makin' movies
Keep the money in the wall, can't find the toolie
Cop the money everyday, wake up
Whip, whip, whip, whip, time to shake it up
Microwave it, watch it cool, bake it up
Me and BMG we always flexed up

Cut the top of the Lamborghini, coolin'
I be juugin', finessin' and coolin'
Two foreign bitches and they down to make a movie
Call me Bob the Builder, yeah I keep the toolie
Bad bitches in the kitchen with them pots & pans
Me and scale in the living room weighin' grams
Whole thang 950, and if them folks come up to my trap
Them packs I'm finna wrap so they ain't gonna smell it
Cut the top of the Lamborghini, coolin'
Got to juug overseas I'm bout to pursue it
Got your bitch and her friend makin' movies
Keep the money in the wall, can't find the toolie
Cop the money everyday, wake up
Whip, whip, whip, whip, time to shake it up
Microwave it, watch it cool, bake it up
Me and BMG we always flexed up

I told you on juug season that I'm juugin' for no reason
Got to watch out for your partner cause your partner be police
Cash out four cars with no leases
I keep cash fuck a visa, I got swag, I rock teaser
Two foreign bitches speak no English
I keep missing keep them kilos move them packs to Puerto Rico
Get them C note, black amigo, everything we do illegal
Ride in foreign fuck a rego', I be doin' it for my people
And my people is a migo so I'm juugin' just to feed em

Cut the top of the Lamborghini, coolin'
Got to juug overseas I'm bout to pursue it
Got your bitch and her friend makin' movies
Keep the money in the wall, can't find the toolie
Cop the money everyday, wake up
Whip, whip, whip, whip, time to shake it up
Microwave it, watch it cool, bake it up
Me and BMG we always flexed up3Embed
