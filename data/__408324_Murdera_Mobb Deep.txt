13 ContributorsMurdera Lyrics
We know how that song go...
This one called, The Murdera

Uh, yeah
Uh huh, uh
Die, nigga, die
Die, nigga

Look into my crystal ball, I see murder for y'all
First things first, order a hearse for y'all
First nigga open his mouth first to fall
Watch who you talkin' to, nigga, first of all
My gang don't get along, we arrogant
Take a while for you to assess what the damage is
Give a fuck POP where them cameras is
New York shit under new management
Blessin' in disguise, black mask and black gloves
Forecasts; grey skies, tears of a black dove
I can change your life, I just need you to act up
Yeah, that's karma, we don't believe in no bad luck
He without sin cast the first stone
Good in any hood I blend like a earth tone
I murk microphones, it's a homicide
As I watch the soul from your body rise
You might also like
Pop, pop, pop, murder, murder, kill, kill
Do it for the money or we do it for the thrill
Hustlin' the goal 'til my nose run and spill
Blood on the streets, I'm 'bout that dolla dolla bill

I'm out for gunshots to represent me
Do it for the principle and do this shit for free
You scared motherfucker? You stay away from me
You snitch motherfucker? You supposed to be a G
The chickens and the rats and the snakes all click
They can't come outside no more, I'm on my shit
I'm talkin' right now, you talkin' back then
Yeah, it's a new day, wake up and get a whiff, can you smell it?
Thatâ€™s a bitch nigga flesh burnin'
I put pussy holes all over your back
You run from the TEC squirtin'
Oh, suddenly these niggas is feelin' me
And all that blood loss got 'em catchin' epiphanies
Young fly rap nigga and I BRAPP niggas
I understand why you upset I'm that nigga (Ugh)
Shootin' star, I'm a gun totin' celeb
I wield pistoles, put 'em in wheelchairs
Fuck a peace treaty, they tried to O.D. on me
But now you want me to chill and call police on me
I'm outside of the law, above the system
I piss on the courtroom floor, I don't give fucks
Pop, pop, pop, murder, murder, kill, kill
Do it for the money or we do it for the thrill
Hustlin' the goal 'til my nose run and spill
Blood on the streets, I'm 'bout that dolla dolla bill

Yeah, R-I-P for those try to go against we (Rest in peace)
We the M-O-B-B, make you swallow all your teeth (You take that)
And fuck the police, we New York's finest
Top shelf gangsta shit, yeah, we the grimiest
You send me up the river? I send you up the river Styx
Bitchy ass nigga, you bleed infamous
Come again

Pop, pop, pop, murder, murder, kill, kill
Do it for the money or we do it for the thrill
Hustlin' the goal 'til my nose run and spill
Blood on the streets, I'm 'bout that dolla dolla bill
Pop, pop, pop, murder, murder, kill, kill
Do it for the money or we do it for the thrill
Hustlin' the goal 'til my nose run and spill
Blood on the streets, I'm 'bout that dolla dolla bill
