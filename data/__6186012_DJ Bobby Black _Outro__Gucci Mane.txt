5 ContributorsDJ Bobby Black (Outro) Lyrics
You guys know how we do around this town
It's the kid Bobby Black, the ruler inside the building
You wanna hit me up for more info, you can holler at me
678-859-3303
Chicken Talk, Pt. 2, the hood album, the official hood album
For the streets, for the hood, you already know how we get it in, world famous super frenzy
Shouts wanna be in DJ Mars and all that
Shouts to my man Zaytoven on the beat
It's Zaytoven, buddy, you hear that?
Shouts to my people over there at mixtapekings.com
Rap.com, they got the official Chicken Talk, Pt. 2 on that
You already know how we gets it in
It's the kid Bobby Black, you know what?
Start this motherfucker from the top, roll anothеr swisher
Tap the bottle, I'ma meet you back at thе frontYou might also likeEmbed
