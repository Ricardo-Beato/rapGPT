7 ContributorsMurder Game Lyricsx2
(Murder game)
Playing on the 1-8-7
Bullets fly around this bitch 2-4-7
Make a homicide at a 2-11
Have a motherfucking running straight towards heaven
(Murder game)

Playing on the murder game play
Show me where we is, nigga, show me where we at
And ...
We gonna find us where we at
When the ...
Let'em notice where we at
And tell me where we is
I'mma cop a couple shales
Leave your stomach drippin' like an open lunchpale
Run up on a nigga with the 4o, go BLOCKO!
This nigga soft like a old hard taco (murder game)
Just a bunch of nigga ... (gluten ?)
SWATS and the jacks and the old nigga ....
Niggas get retired, everything a nigga lost
Pay a nigga off, send him to the pay off
... a nigga over, when a shoot don't miss
Irrespect, ... now walking with a limp
Ain't a woman in a city for the lo
And your mama cryin', that's a real loose-up

Gets no turn when your fat catch grenade (who?)
I duct ... with a chopper and a swiss blade
Smack a bitch nigga with a (papa ?) cause he bitch made
I turn you frontyard Crimson homo
You choke on Simpson come around like Romo
My gun swiss cheese bozo ...

Shoot guns and toss it, be cautious
Fuck your stare, ARs take your tops off like Tupperware
I'm a motherfucking problem, deal with it
You can bring all your security and still get it
Fools realize that their homeboys are not as hard
Cause they fuckin' body guards need a body guard
