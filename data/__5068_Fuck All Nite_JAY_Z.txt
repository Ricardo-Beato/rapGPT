You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? You should be comin' home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury
Now you been, comin' in while you wakin' up (Yeah!)
Actin' like you behave and stuff (Uh-huh)
Uh-huh, you should be comin' home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury, now check it

Yes, a lime to a lemon, my VA women
Walk in Manolo Blahniks 'cause my condo with elevators in 'em
She wanna wrinkle my linens
So I sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinnin', uhh
Blasphemy, oh my God, every sentence
She keeps scratchin' me like she have tiger in her
This is exact-a-ly, why I had to pin her
To the bed like a wrestler, had to pretzel her, uhh
Her man kept pagin', stressin' her
So I told her what to say just in case he question her
Situations will arise, but you gotta be smart about it
No matter what you do (Don't talk about us)
Don't give up no info (He'll be lost without it)
Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again, bring a friend!

Guess who's back in my motherfuckin' house
Half black, half white chick; I call her Minnie Mouse (Woo!)
We always hook up when we out
We do what we like to do and then we out
But lately I've been havin' the strangest feelings
Your boy Young Hov' catchin' feelings
And it's messin' up my dealings 'cause mami's not willin'
To leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend
Said, we was just 'sposed to hook up and have a blast
She called me her emergency dick-in-a-glass, haha (Hehehe)
I had to laugh for a second
Had to check myself, get my mackin' back in perspective
I slack for a second but I'm back, no question
Like I walk with a cane, ain't no half steppin'
Geah, and on that note
Iceberg Slim is back to rock a boat, c'mon
You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? You should be comin' home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury

Let's fuck all night! Yeah
Until we both start yawnin' (Yeah)
To the bright Shirley Murdock morning (Yeah)
Until we both start yawnin'
Let's just fuck all night! Yeah
Let's have breakfast baby (Yeah)
Have lunch, have dinner, back to breakfast baby (Yeah)
Let's have breakfast baby

Have lunch, have dinner, back to breakfast maybe
That is, if that kid don't get too suspicious
Start blowin' up your digits
Showin' up livid, claimin' he wanna fight
But Shawn all business with his type (Uh-uh)
Nah, Shawn just tryna keep the friendship tight
Shawn to Sean Paul 'em if you gimme the light
And this way, you can stay for life, aight?
You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? You should be comin' home with me
