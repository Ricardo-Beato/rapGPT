149 ContributorsI. Flight of the Navigator Lyrics
"I had a dream. I had a dream I was flying over all of us. There were so many pretty people, so many pretty faces. I talked to some birds. I fell in love again. And none of this ever ended. Everything just kept going, and going, and going. And even when you laughed, you cried. And even when you were sad, you were really happy. 'Cause you were here, and I got to meet every star. Every planet, everything that made me. And we all kissed, and became the same. We became the same, we became the same."

Who would have thought this? We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness, it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition, keep 'em off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been

We are all cold water
Why try at all? Why bother?

Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling

Who would have dreamed this? You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know

We are all knight's fallen
Why try at all? Dark calling
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still my broken bones, as I travel on
You might also like
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still my broken bones, as I travel on
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
