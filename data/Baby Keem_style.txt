I'm balling with my friends
Staring at the money in a trance
Lil' baby, can I be your mans?

Got way more money than my peers, you would assume
In competition with myself, I cannot lose
What we gon' eat?

We fuck, wakе up, you go, we go to

Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, free—

You know I'm borderline more than rich, had to tame the orphanage
Navigated two bitches, textin' them the coordinates
Two phones literally, house party loiterin'
Deals so dummy had to let several lawyers in
One day, I'll tell you how my life was unfortunate
For now, I'll tell you how fast these Porsches get
Story of the young and reckless, 'bout to eat my bitch for breakfast
Pink pussy been a prеference, nеver fold under pressure
Cheap shots, let it rock, eye open, Fetty Wap
Rain like confetti drop, I bet he drop
I don't hate the trendy things, just don't like to feed the trends
Mama gave me all my sins, love me when the story ends
Flowers on my uncle's tomb, thousands to my auntie's too
I'm used to takin' backstreets, last week was nothing new
Bitches is my scapegoat, who I made this tape for?
I tell the story two years later, for now, the case closed

If I cancel, who the fuck you think you talkin' to?
If I cancel, call my eldest bitch and tell her, "Deuce"
If I, "doot-doot, doot-doot," then that mean I'm probably at the bank
If I, "doot-doot, doot-doot," hug my bitch, I gotta keep her safe
If I, "doot-doot, doot-doot," taper, taper, takin' off her face
If I, "doot-doot, doot-doot," said she want a smart nigga with taste
I can't talk about all the shit that I done did (I can't talk about)
I can't talk about all the bitches I done hit (I can't talk about)
I can't talk about all the niggas that got fed (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
My pockets be blue, but my eyes, they still see red (Rrr)
Doot-doot, doot-doot, fuck the loaf, I make the bread (Yeah)
Doot-doot, doot-doot, I see numbers in my head (I'm alive)
I like dead people instead
Doot-doot, doot-doot, ain't 'bout money, texts on read (Yeah)4Embed
A life of pain, what I think of when I caress my chain
Am I ashamed? Project, shelters, and that crack cocaine
I seen too much behind them bars of that windowpane
I seen my opp yesterday, I'm sad, I'm glad you came
Grabbed my bitch butt yesterday, I said, "I'm glad you came"
She caught me cheatin' in them pictures, I said, "I was framed"
I got taste, lil' baby, this ain't no Mulsanne
Baby, this ain't Johnny Dang
I done took a lot of careers that been in my lane (In my lane, in my lane)
Bitch, get out my way
It ain't no amount of money that could make me change
If you send your bitch my way, she'd get rearranged
Lead a whole friеnd group, I can entertain
I did my dance in arеnas and it wasn't strange
I don't do no baby Rovers, this the biggest Range (Rrr)
I'm with Bridgeway and Lil L, I got on all my chains
I can't wild out with lil' bro, he like to piss on graves
I'm only hangin' out with niggas that is potty-trained
My main bitch duckin' fame
She got no Instagram, these IG bitches surely lame
And these is eerie times and I put that on pgLangYou might also likeEmbed

Baby, cook some'
Took the 95 to the 110
Headed your way, through the pape' and drape
Through the yellow tape, blew the motor, got the Toyota on the tow way
Took it to José, it took him four days
He said, "It's the transmission," I said, "No way," uh
Them the days we couldn't buy no gourmet
Forget the bad things that happened with the foreplay
So when we walkin' in any venue, it's a light show
Catch a dinner and a movie, wear your nice clothes
I throw the burner phone away, I go ice cold
Can't lose my main bitch fuckin' with my side hoеs
I know she mad when the tеxt is full of typos
She ask me 'bout this chick Alexis, she like 5'4", uh
She don't care about me, she entitled
I'm fuckin' her and I fucked the bitch she idol
I'm inspired by the women with no rivals
I'm inspired by the women that wanna be politicians
Inspired by the women that leisure is "go and get it"
The independent women that never need men to listen
I caught my mama cryin' 'bout dude, I couldn't get it
And since then, I hated every boyfriend she been with

Overseas, I need emergencies ('Mergencies)
I used to be at my mama house dreamin' the SVR racin' through quarantine
I'm fresh out the gut, you never believe it
I feel like the hood prima donna
I slid on these opp in a Honda
Then jumped off the stage at The Fonda (Uh)
My manager yellin' at me, I called her, "Dramatic"
I think that I'll let her have it
I got my ear to the back of them, back of them streets
Unbearable habits
My name is Hykeem and I move through the building as if I was destined to grasp it
I'm dodgin' the drugs, but havin' the women 'cause I am the son of an—
