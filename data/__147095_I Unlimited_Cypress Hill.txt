5 ContributorsI Unlimited Lyrics
Came back to life for your protection
Back from the dead of resurrection
We came to change the whole complexion
Take this game a new direction

Last stop where the gas popped
When the kush blows free and the low-lows drop
This photo-op, no flash, we smash, get cash
Cash out the fuckin' spot

It’s a new day to build, expect the Hill
We grab the wheel, the trip is real
Don't make me pull out the steel
And cause a commotion, emotions kill

Heat-seekers, if you come seek us
Serve your asses through your weak speakers
Anyone, anywhere, we on jack
Blowing up another spot with the bomb track

Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Kill em up, tear em up, put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If he acts tough, shut him up, gun 'em down
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Gettin' high, let 'em ride, put 'em down
Jump jump jump jump
If you don’t give a fuck, throw 'em up, put 'em down
You might also like
The fear factor, the pit reactor
Adrenalin maxed in bringing the rapture
Wreck havoc we coming at ya
Studio gangsters applying to AFTRA

Still print that real shit
I'm the dog in the cut that's real hard to deal with
How long have we held you down
And broke down doors with that grimey sound?

No surrender, we push and enter
Take over the scene and blaze the green
Put a chill through ya body when you saw my teeth
Find yourself in the middle where the pit convenes

Don't slip on the misfits
'Cause the minute you pop shit, the mic gets twisted

Anytime, anywhere we blast off
The riot starts as you party your ass off
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Kill em up, tear em up, put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If he acts tough, shut him up, gun 'em down
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Gettin' high, let 'em ride, put 'em down
Jump jump jump jump
If you don’t give a fuck, throw 'em up, put 'em down

We blow smoke in the air to heal the nation
Gettin' you high no hesitation
So hard to charge, no complication
Take another hit for inspiration
Legalize don’t criticize
'Cause one day you might understand who we symbolize
Any man, any woman gotta like that
FEDS trying put a case, gotta fight back

We flip shows, like Flipmode
We make you bounce on the track with sick flows and get doe
Don't trip in the mosh pit
It's a danger to strangers, results are toxic
We're phenomenal, so unstoppable
Unlimited, you're just comical
Stay back, with slayed jack (way back)
Payback's a bitch and we know how to play that
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Kill em up, tear em up, put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If he acts tough, shut him up, gun 'em down
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Gettin' high, let 'em ride, put 'em down
Jump jump jump jump
If you don’t give a fuck, throw 'em up, put 'em downEmbed
