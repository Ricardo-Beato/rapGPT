17 ContributorsA Minute for Your Son Lyrics
You got a minute for Yo' son, Father? I need to talk
I'm so tired of tryin' to run, Father, let's take a walk
I'm so sorry for what I done, Father, it ain't my fault
But the devil's been on my back lately, he's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle, but it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual, but I need You, God
Lot of things that I used to, I don't wanna
Run the streets like I used to, I know I'm gonna
Speak the word for You one day
Up in there like, "Hallelujah!" on Sunday
I thank You Lord for the blessings that You gave me
And for my life, with the blessings You have saved me
And for my wife, You have carried me enough times - and that's the truth
Married me to rough times, throughout my Youth
And through it all I saw that You was still with me
I was that one lost sheep and You was comin' to get me

Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...

I look at life a little different now, since You hugged me
And I always loved my peoples, but now they love me
Thank You for the love, Lord, we praise Ya
Jacob's descendants, from Africa to Asia
Pleadin' the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right, just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout Yo' name in times of need
And times of joy, and, when we bleed
And, when we are overcome with greed
You ain't gon' have to tell me twice, I'mma take heed
And because of what You've given me, I know You'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I, never knew I had
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad
All praises due to Ya
That's why I had to dedicate somethin' new to Ya, thank You Father

Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...

Uhh... I never knew a love like, this before
Messin with the thug life I, missed it all
You opened the doors and, let me in
I'm down for the cause so, let's begin
Prayers that You give to me I give to them
Same way You live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now
You got me smilin' from inside of my heart, when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain anymore
Only sunshine, no pain anymore, I really love my
You washed away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, the whole thirty years
You know that... one day I'll speak the word
You know that... when I do I will be heard
You know that... You gave me a permanent smile
And You know this, Father, because I'm Yo' child, what?

Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...49Embed
