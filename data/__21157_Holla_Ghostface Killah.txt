18 ContributorsHolla Lyrics
I'm from a place where fish was made
Corduroy Balleys, sportin' those Rakim K's
Rakeem came
High self-esteem promised me a moment in life just to wreck y'all lames
Throw the TEC to your brain, puttin' the best to shame
This is Theodore, best to tuck those Dana Danes
See me comin' (Blaow) start runnin' and (Blaow, blaow)
Ayo (Blaow, blaow, blaow)
Kunta fly niggas when we walk through the party
Pimp talk with the MAC strapped to our body
Bartenders is nervous, 'fraid to serve us, bad service
Un smacked him on purpose, you see us drunk, come and burp us
Paper chasin', Starky stayed up in the makings
Theodore conquer the four devils with the patience
Cell phones is blowin', the crew's not available
Ask 'Donna, word in the town, we the realest dudes
We don't need no diamond rings
All we need is a drum, like, fuck it, he can rhyme, I'll sing
And in my Yankee hat, you can drop five beans
And then run back to mama, like, all I know is

Holla, holla, holla if you want to
I'll buzz you
Holla, holla, holla if you want to
I'll buzz you
You might also like
When I walk through any function
You bet your ass that the four-five'll cook, fuck your wack looks
Fuck platinum, fuck, I'ma show ya'll crooks
This is legit rap, I.R.S. can suck my books
I'm a family man (Uh), Clan mixed with Theodore
My boots hang over the telephone wires on Broad'
Word to MetLife, Tony got insurance on his mics
Smoke mad shit and still got endurance when he fight
Both hands crusty, bank account dusty
Ever say my name again, you pussy
Like a angry crippled man, don't push me
Don't believe the kid, listen to me

Holla, holla, holla if you want to
I'll buzz you
Holla, holla, holla if you want to
I'll buzz you

Dirty told me to rock the spot (Yeah)
Freak the beats 'cause the streets is raw (Go 'head)
Don't believe what you see, just watch (True)
Speak to the seeds, give 'em lead on jobs (Come on)
Educate, keep it peace with Gods (That's right)
In return, happiness in globs (Yeah)
We see the future like a psychic's palm
Things I'm saying are true
And the way I explain them to you
Yes, to you, listen to me
Holla, holla, holla if you want to
I'll buzz you
Holla, holla, holla if you want to
I'll buzz you3Embed
