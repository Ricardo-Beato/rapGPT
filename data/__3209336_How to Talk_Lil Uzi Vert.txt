83 ContributorsHow to Talk Lyrics
And you didn't come here for me, let's talk about it
'Cause if you would have came here for me, that would've been planned
You would've put me on
You ain't say, "Oh I'm coming this day, I'm coming that"
You sit here and you tell me one thing and you always do another
'Cause, cause let me know, let me... let me tell you why
'Cause you're not a man of your word
That's - that's the reason why. So let's talk about it
Oh, you come here for nothing
No, you came here for what?
Whatever you came here for
So, whatever
You have no type of communication at all
So get up out my comments

Talk to me nice (Skrrt)
Talk to me nice (Whatever)
Talk to me nice (Mhm)
Know I'm gon' ball yeah
No way I could fall, yeah (What?)
They predicted next fall yeah (What?)
Look at them, like, "Aw yeah" (No way)
Talk to me (Whoo)
Talk to me nice (Lil Uzi)
Talk to me nice (Uh-huh)
Talk to me nice (Come on)
Or don't talk to me at all, yeah (Nope)
On the way, one call yeah (Yeah)
Count it up and it's all there (Yeah)
Water hittin' look like small tears (Yeah)

Told her talk to me nice (Talk to me)
Talk to me nice (Woo)
I say it once (Mm), I won't say it twice (Twice)
Okay might say it twice (Ooh), because I'm kinda high (Ooh)
Even though I'm so evil (Uh), I still look at the sky
And I ask why
Why I treat her like my dog, yeah
We supposed to be all here (Aw, yuh)
She got different color long hair
Pull up coupe, two small chairs (Skrrt)
Took that girl right in the club (Yuh)
Felt the booty and it's all there (There)
So smooth so its all nair
Heard she talk to a ball player (What?), It's cool
Heard she talk to a ball player, but you know I keep it all player
And I heard he ain't a star player
I'm not worried, I'm a heartbreaker
I'm in outer space, on Mars faded
I'm not tryna make it R-rated (Yuh)
But my niggas look like Darth Vader (Yuh, yuh, yuh, ayy)
Ohh, ohh

Talk to me nice (Skrrt)

Water hittin' look like small tears (Yeah)
I was in a dream (Whoo)
Yeah I used to dream (Yup)
I was all a dream (Duh)
Now I'm in reality, don't need those
Fantasy, what I see, sleep when I'm woke (Yuh)
Real ones can't die (Lil Uzi), only multiply (Yup)
I know something it ain't right (Ooh), how you put me to the side? (Gee)
When I called your phone, yeah, you said I was lyin' (Lyin'?)
How am I lyin'? (What) I just pulled up to my show (Yuh)
I'm still on the grind
Heard you got a chauffeur (Heard dat, woo)
(Lil' Uzi, Lil' Uzi, Lil' Uzi, Lil' Uzi)
Talk to me nice, (I heard that) talk to me nice (Ya heard)
Heard she a Doll when she mad, why I flood her all in ice (Skrrt)
Ride it like a bike, bust me like a Sprite
Load up the jet for New York tonight

Talk to me nice (Skrrt)
