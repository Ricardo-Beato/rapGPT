5 ContributorsProblem Child Lyrics{Mysonne} (DMX)
{Mysonne, Mysonne the problem child DMX Ruff Ryders}
(Wanna flow wanna problem)
{Problem Children, y'all niggas got problems}
(Wanna flow wanna problem)

{But they don't want no problems} (Nah baby)
{But they don't want no problems} (Wanna flow wanna problem)
{But they don't want no problems nah nah they don't want no problems}
(Wanna flow wanna problem)
{But they don't want no problems}
{But they don't want no problems} (Wanna flow wanna problem)
{But they don't want no problems nah nah they don't want no problems}
(No problems I'm telling you baby)

Yo, yo I told niggas to pack they bags or grab they guns before I come
It's too late, y'all had your fun!
It's all over now! I don't wanna talk to niggas!
Popping shots like corks in niggas!
Sticking forks in niggas' cause they done!
Only reason y'all still breathing is cause y'all run!
When we bust shots, my nigga clutch Glocks
Broad daylight in front of precincts; fuck cops!
Niggas want pops? Then they die for them!
Kiss the barrel, cry for them!
Spirit leave your body, touch the sky for them
Fuck Voltron! See what me and mines form
In the .9 storm; death: time's gone!
I'm that cat that y'all niggas got your eyes on
Go to papi broke trying to get your pies on
The day that I'm gone I'm real fuck stardom
Niggas wanna talk, but they don't want no problems!
You might also like

All y'all niggas want is your heart back; dog, you pussy
Acting like you really wanna bark back; don't push me
Only room enough for one dog to hold the shit down
You cowards know it now (What!?) I'ma hold it down
When I'm done close it down; it's my shit here!
The fuck that nigga just say? Try shit here!
Come on, cupcake, y'all cats ain't even built like that
I done seen through the bullshit; I'm real like that
I know how to walk the dog, I know how to chase the cat
I know how to get a bone, I know how to bring it back
I know how to flip on a nigga, split him with the bat
I know how to train a pup to make sure they scratch
You motherfuckers don't want no problems, 'cause my revolver is solving them
One by one until it's all of them
Let that be a lesson to your mans and shit:
Keep your fucking mouth shut if your mans want spit, nigga!


Well it's the kid that'll crush your head into a cake batter
Y'all know that cake mix but y'all don't wanna taste this shit
Guns I should've been arrested for
Y'all gone make my bullets expand like a lesbi jaw
Don't you test me, boy!
Don't fuck with X or Drag-to-the-Dash, 'cause once you dump in these bags
You drag to the trash dumpster, amongst the rest of them fags!
My poker got your skin looking like acupunctures
Keep a silence on the tip; can't afford the noise
My banger got a jagged edge like them four boys
If you hot, I'll Super Soak you, and you won't be able to dry it off
Just relax, take your last breath, and die it off!
Nothing but love I spread
But if you take advantage, the weight that's lead will rush your head
You sweat'll die your hair red, like my bitch Eve!
And no, I'm not a faggot, but I make niggas striptease in front of me
It's fun to me, bitches!
