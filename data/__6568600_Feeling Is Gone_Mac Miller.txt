1 ContributorFeeling Is Gone Lyrics
TreeJay presents Sour Hour
I just hit this weed, but uh, now it's like
The feelin' is gone and I must get it back right away
(Haha, you know what I'm sayin'?)

Ah damn, think I just put out my last blunt
Empty plastic bag, lookin' like I need to grab some bomb
'Cause this feelin' is gone
I'm comin' down off this high and the weekend is long
It's full of grind, so I need to get some shit to ease my mind
Call me Corona 'cause I gotta keep that lime gap pine like 
Without it, I'ma fall and break
Chingy with the sticky, my connect is just a call away
I grab the zip while we gotta smoke it all today
I should be chillin', coppin' shoes at the mall with cake
But I gotta keep workin' like an office space
Comin' after numbers, now they callin' me Deuteronomy
My weed is fuel, so I need that sour diеsel
Just called my dude, and in half an hour hе will hit me
Billy keep the flavors of the sticky
That do you like some acid, have you tripping
Yeah, you know I smoke it, ya mama probably smoke it
And I can guarantee Obama smoke it
Just hittin' L's with Michelle, shit, I think I'm sober now
Let me grab my cell and see what smokes around

Ayo, Bill
Yo, what's good, Mac?
Yeah, I need some weed, man, I'm out
Uh, alright, alright
Right now
Aight, man, damn
Yeah, right now, I'm comin' over
What you need it that bad for?
Man, you know how it is when it's just like
The feelin' is gone and I must get it back right away
(Okay, okay, yeah, look)

I got that good weed sendin', hit this chronic smoke
Pounds to  so they send me, our closet fulls
Yeah, I'm honest, is four-forty-eight on the dot
You know I counted eighteen thou' for five of them
Been around  Swishers blowin' clouds of piff
Ounce of sour down, goin' in, you know what time it is
Thinkin' over lines, smokin', never too high to spit
Never doin' time 'cause we seem friendly in an environment
Ready to retire my early twenties, so I'm tryna spit
And get my workin' heavy so there's plenty more time to live
I can't lie, I'm livin' better, so I'll die with what I did
That's why I'm smokin' all the time with Mac Miller
So when he hits me, get my bitch up off me
Smokin' out the Civi' all night, never miss the party
Yeah, get her started on those spliffs  cigars for later
For that late-night Swisher with ya bitchy on me
And wake up to the next hit, early mornin' smokin'
Strap my Jordans, goin' to breakfast, blowin' smoke out like Vince, yeahEmbed
