13 ContributorsBad 4 Me LyricsYeah, gimme some gangsta shit curr
Some of that hood shit
Coming up
How that sound ?
I've been doing this shit since day one
Yeah nigga, day one, day one yeah
Let me, let me tell you what your worth is
Wake up in the mornin with a purpose
Only you can make me happy, surface
East side long beach baby, the turf shit
The place where I lurked at
13 on the scene getting bent back
With a whole lotta snake venom
Used to steal annihilators out the highway center
Up early getting shit started
Back flippin', trippin', tippin', Crippin' cold hearted
Way before I got high man
Both double up 15s from the pie man
Heat out the motherfucking frying pan
Little kids love Snoop, fuck IronMan
I'm a vet on the set I ain't lyin man
Let me show you how fly I am
Play in the school, lay in the pool
And I stay in the cool
Young loc I ain't playin with fools
Reset, repeat
Unlock and recock
The heat and it gets so fast
Spend yo cash
It will get in yo ass
Now the question is this for now
Are you really in love with that bitch yo?
Another man's trash is another man's treasure
What's your pleasure?
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye
On my balcony, asking how can I?

When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me
Curr I used to run with struck out gon' away
Cold things is he called me on the phone today
Told me he was up for release
Its been about a dub since cuz seen the streets
Yeah loc, shit don' change
Long Beach don' flipped crazy durange
Everybody sellin' out, word of mouth, the OG's tellin' now
I drove there the other day
To chop some game with my big homie Donald Ray
Its sort of hard for me to run away
Step out my car no gun today, underlay
I press my luck, if I get stuck, well then thats whats up
How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me
The true definition of that mixtape
How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me
Somebody pass that piff, grow it up
