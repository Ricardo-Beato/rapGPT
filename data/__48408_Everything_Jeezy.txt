12 ContributorsEverything Lyrics
Wassup? you got to man up, the fuck is that?
You don't know who I is? oh yeah
Well you ain't got shit on me, haha, Young!

You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything

I'm going out the same way I came in, harder than a motherfucker
Real street nigga I ain't nothin like these other suckers (Nah)
How much the club cost I might buy this motherfucker
Have the feds park right outside this motherfucker!
You know the name bitch, hotter than fish grease
Got a hundred move a hundred that was this week (Damn)
She want me to get the room man this bitch cheap (What?)
But she roll the weed good and she a big freak (Woah)
We on 75 her hands down my 87's
Dolce Gabbana belt, you know the MAC-11
First name Gots, last name Ends
Fix your mouth, fix your face, you might get a Benz
You might also like
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything

Put that on momma, my daddy and everything I love
For everything I rap, my gangstas in the trap
You can't see me with a magnifying glass
Two hundred on the dash, try some games, I'll bust ya ass
Nigga whole clique, iPhones, nigga, get your shine on
Used to whip it up and zip it up now it's the microphone
No man alive can't stop my shine, I'm a hustla mayne
I want it bad cause Bad Azz came from nothing man
Shining on 'em, grinding on 'em, 'bout what I'm talking bout
If I show your bitch my house, she gone take my dick and floss
Show after show I'm getting dough, hundred G's at a time
I'm MJ round my way and Louisiana is mine, nigga!

You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
You niggas ain't seein' me, I put that on everything
I put that on everything, put that on everything
Boy or b-boy, I'm a man about his business
Draw the line right where the family is
Devil cross it, be the boss of it
Love you down, until I've exhausted it
Other dudes, they pursue but they're clouds of you
I kneel down on my knees and I pray with you
I never walked for much, I make due for us
Believe me, I stand on my word
I put that on everything, believe me when I say

Put that on everything, everything
Put that on everything, everything
Put that on everything, everything
Put that on everything, everything
Put it all on the line for you baby
Put it all on the line for you honey
Put it all on the line for you baby
Put it all on the line for you honey
Put it all on the line for you baby
Put it all on the line for you honey
Put it all on the line, put it all on the line
Put it all on the line
Put that on everything, everything3Embed
