15 ContributorsValet (Interlude) LyricsR*Elevator opens, foot steps, car pulls up*
Iâ€™ma write it down in case you niggas wanna read this
Death in the air, you niggas might just want to breath this
Good motivation 'cause I know you niggas need this
Luxury like the pillows at the St. Regis
Black card down, presidential suite
Black truck out front, like my presidential feet
Presidential rollie, presidential wrist
Bout to order room service, this some presidential shit, let's go!

First I count a hundred, then I hit the mall
Bitch, I'm on my shit, yeah I might just buy a stall
She said, "You say the pussy good, how come you never call"
Said bitch, "That ain't my focus yet, I'm tryna never fall"
You can chase some love, baby, I'm just chasin' paper
And if I hit a lick, I might just take ya to Jamaica
And you can bring your friends, but she bet not be a faker
If she ain't talkin' bout fuckin', then we gon mufuckin' shake
Got that NFL money, that pay the bail money
That see me in the street, it ain't hard to tell money
Yeah it's really street though, we a higher ego
That St. Regis Bal Harbour for the week dough

2 Mil in wheels sittin' in the valet
Throw me my keys, and have a nice day
You ain't said shit, I'ma have a nice night
And anything I want, I'ma buy the shit twice
2 Mil in wheels sittin' in the valet
Throw me my keys, and have a nice day
You ain't said shit, I'ma have a nice night
And anything I want, I'ma buy the shit twice
2 Mil in wheels sittin' in the valet
Throw me my keys, and have a nice day
You ain't said shit, I'ma have a nice night
And anything I want, I'ma buy the shit twice
2 Mil in wheels sittin' in the valet
Throw me my keys, and have a nice day
You ain't said shit, I'ma have a nice night
And anything I want, I'ma buy the shit twiceYou might also likeEmbed
