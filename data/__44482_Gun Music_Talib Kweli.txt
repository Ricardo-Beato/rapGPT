Now
If I'm out of town my crew take of ya bodies the more the merrier
Point and spray the area, niggas is quick to bury ya
Punk niggas feel inferior, guns make us superior
Cats start acting scarier, situations get hairier, yo
You know who killing it? Niggas saying they militant
The only blood in the street is when the government spilling it
You could have a hand gun or a cannon and you still start the day
Without the knowledge and wisdom and understanding of

A .22 Derringer, a .38 long
A .44 Desert Eagle, a Glock Nine
Time to protect the fam, I'm a cock mine
"I make the streets run red like a stop sign," stop lying

P-poi-poi, clack-clack-clack-clack-clack
Gun man music never take shot back
P-poi-poi, clack-clack-clack-clack-clack
Ghetto red hot 'round the world, you hear that?
P-poi-poi, clack-clack-clack-clack-clack
Gun man youth never take shot back (Yes)
P-poi-poi, clack-clack-clack-clack-clack
Ghetto red hot 'round the world, you hear that?
In Jamaica, In Brooklyn
In Ethiopia, we go there and back
To all my real live soldier cats, where you at?
Dogs don't hold them back
Hose the cats that go to strapped to blow a back
You might also like
You could be whoever: a black panther, a lap dancer
When respect is the question folks coming with the gat answer
Shoot at your feet like spider, you a tap dancer
What am I, amusing to you? You better have that answer
Toys for guns, I got guns for toys
Silencers bring the heat without bringing the noise
Bringing the funk of dead bodies, go ahead bring in your boys
You'll see the soul of black folk like W.E.B. Du Bois
Israelis got tanks and Palestinians got rocks
Inmates got shanks and dirty cops, they got Glocks
We got tribes in Africa that listen to Pac
Fighting with brothers who pump Biggie like they live on the block

P-poi-poi, clack-clack-clack-clack-clack
Gun man music never take shot back
P-poi-poi, clack-clack-clack-clack-clack
Ghetto red hot 'round the world, you hear that?
P-poi-poi, clack-clack-clack-clack-clack
Gun man youth never take shot back (Brooklyn)
P-poi-poi, clack-clack-clack-clack-clack
Ghetto red hot 'round the world, you hear that?
In Jamaica (Kingston), In Brooklyn (Flatbush)
In Ethiopia (Yep), we go there and back (Come on)
To all my real live soldier cats, where you at?
Dogs don't hold them back
Hose the cats that go to strapped to blow a back
These are the tools of the trade, that we use to get paid
When we cruise on escapades and escalades with guns to blaze
We been this ways since the younger days, safe from the hunger pains
Bang when the trouble came, pioneers of gun slang
Supply you with them things a little something, something
Set fire to the game, my system be thumping
(P-poi-poi) the sounds of guns busting
(P-poi-poi) your heart just start pumping

A .22 Derringer, a .38 long
A .44 Desert Eagle, a Glock Nine
Time to protect the fam, I'm a cock mine
"I make the streets run red like a stop sign," stop lying
Gun music y'all
