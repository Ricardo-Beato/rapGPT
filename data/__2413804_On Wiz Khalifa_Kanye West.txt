40 ContributorsOn Wiz Khalifa LyricsOh niggas must think I'm not petty cause I'm the best that's ever made music
Like, oh that's Ye and I can put his wife's initials on my twitter   @Wizkhalifa
Bro first of all you stole your whole shit from Cudi
Second, your first single was corny as fuck and most there after
Work hard play hardYou have distracted from my creative process
I went to look at your twitter and you were wearing cool pants
I screen grabbed those pants and sent it to my style team #Wizwearscoolpants
3rd no one I know has ever listened to one of your albums all the way through
4th you let a stripper trap you
5th    I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years
6th  don't ever come out the side of your neck at me
7th I am your OG    and I will be respected as such
8th  I made it so we could wear tight jeans
9th   me and Cudi created this shit
10th   don't you ever in your fucking life speak sideways about a nigga that's fighting for us    I do this for all of us
11th   I showed you respect as a man when I met you
12th   You wouldn't have a child if it wasn't for me
13th   You own waves????  I own your child!!!!
14th   Nigga it's called creativity    #youshouldtryitsomeday
15th   Nigga I tried to call you and you changed your number
16th   don't even hint at mentioning me my family or my wife   I am your OG
17th   I think you dress cool      I wish I was skinny and tall
Maybe I couldn't be skinny and tall but I'll settle for being the greatest artist of all time as a consolation
Don't ever ever ever come out the side of your mutherfucking neck bro or bruh or   however you say it Mr. Waves
I'm YE     and I ain't gotta say it the right way      I'm Ye  I'm Ye  I'm Ye  I'm Ye I'm Ye I'm Ye I'm Ye
