Bad habit

Extra, I just spent three thousand on some shoes, bitch, I'm extra
I could turn a bum bitch rude 'cause I'm extra
Who that nigga flexin' with the bag? Bitch, I'm extra
Skecher on me, but I still got swag 'cause I'm extra (Yeah, yeah)

Ten bands to my mans, when he flip it, I'm like, "Yeah" (Yeah, yeah!)
On another plane, I be out of town like, "Yeah" (Yeah, yeah!)
Bougie ho a dime, when I fuck, I be like, "Yeah" (Yeah, yeah!)
Racin' through a red light, when I push gas, I'm like, "Yeah" (Yeah, yeah!)

I just spent three thousand on some shoes, bitch, I'm extra
She just wanna fuck a young nigga 'cause I'm next up
I'ma pack the strap 'cause you know a nigga flexin'
Light up on my feet, now I got these niggas testin' (Yeah, yeah)

Ten bands to my mans, when he flip it, I'm like, "Yeah" (Yeah, yeah!)
On another plane, I be out of town like, "Yeah" (Yeah, yeah!)
Bougie ho a dime, when I fuck, I be like, "Yeah" (Yeah, yeah!)
Racin' through a red light, when I push gas, I'm like, "Yeah" (Woah, woah, yeah!)
You might also like
I want the 'Rari with the horse (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt!)
My whip go faster than yours (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt!), woah
My bitch is badder than yours (Yeah!), woah
My clique is better than yours (Yeah!), woah
Bitch, I'm goin' in, when it's time to win, I win, uh (Yeah, yeah)
If I'm fuckin' one, just know I already fucked her friend, uh (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck a one on one, I'm gettin' rich, I'm gettin' bands, uh (Yeah, yeah)
Goin' at a nigga head like I want revenge, uh (Yeah, yeah)

Extra, I just spent three thousand on some shoes, bitch, I'm extra
I could turn a bum bitch rude 'cause I'm extra
Who that nigga flexin' with the bag? Bitch, I'm extra
Skecher on me, but I still got swag 'cause I'm extra2Embed
