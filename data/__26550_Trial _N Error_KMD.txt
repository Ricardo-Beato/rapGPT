"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
{*Big Bird, scratched: "I could never do that!"*}
"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
"Awww, I made a mistake"
"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
{*Big Bird, scratched: "I could never do that!"*}
"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
{*Big Bird, scratched: "You shouldn't be upset!"*}

Well Love tries, to come across swift, not stuck up
Rise, to minimize the fuck-up, smooth
Rollin in a jazzy light groove, gots nothin to prove though
Just to show how I flow
Like water through yo' kitchen faucet
Notice the fine line - try crossin it!
Don't even pause it, I roar like a lion
You duck, you quackin - so who you tryin?
The main, communicator, Z.L.X-act
Subroc's kickback will crack who can't hack
Range is point blank but my page ain't
You see I speak bold print like black spraypaint
Into the, extra strength new print cause I'm stressed
Zev Love test, God damn, God bless
So let it go, cause it'll just be another Love TKO
So don't try me
You might also like - second 1/2

Yeah I'mmm - servin this one no preservatives
Into sections described from a plank, I'm a splinter
Chip off the new block, Zev Love X-Pel it
And how I tell it will remain a relic
True, black and hard, but I'm no Blackstone
There's no presto in my manifesto
So, take the L, cause you can't take the Z.L
Neither the X, so I don't suggest trial
While, comin off is like a habit, so pardon
I'm too quick to smoke dancer sticks by the carton
I ain't startin a habit if Subroc is not venomous
He's more antidote, cheerin when you're hearin him
So listen up, LISTEN CLOSELY, who's supposed to be
Comin off if we're not?
What I mostly see is scrubs boastin free
But the low key X marks the spot
So don't try me

"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
{*Big Bird, scratched: "I could never do that!"*}
"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
To the bridge, to the bridge, to the bridge, to the bridge (Okay!)
{*musical breakdown followed by scratch: "Go right ahead!"*}

One for the disarranged, two for the duration of time
Ticks and ticks on as I speak
Three for the Hard Way, for real earns pay
No need for a 9 to 5, week by week
Zev Love is for the birds, I save the ducks
But birds if you will stay perched on my jock
Through rough productions we make bucks
And still kill two birds with one Subroc
You wish to go rounds on this dancer stick mister?
This we can do Mr. Magoo, list your bets
Here's eight cards and your odds
A stitch in time, will save nine yards
But if one is ripped, how can one expect
To sew shit up in 80-decca?
I think you need a new sewin needle my friend
So try, try again, but don't try me


Before I kicks it, would anyone care for a cigarette?
... Speechless, I figured it
I understand, followin the leader is a cinch
And suckers out, cause every inch I move and flinch
Nerve pinch strain on my brain from migraine pain
Damn it's my turn to explain
The rules of the game, why me?
Well if at once you don't succeed, don't try me!

"I wanna try"  "Good for you!"
"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
I made a mistake 
"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
"Everyone makes mistakes!"
"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
"I'm gonna try it"
"Well I'll bet if you really tried.."
"I'm gonna try.."
"Well I'll bet if you really tried.." {repeat 4X}
I'm out.. we're like AUDIEmbed
