31 ContributorsNot My Bro Lyrics
Boat, Boat
Yeah, woah
Uh, yeah, ay, uh

Twin tower-living, big booty bitch, dick all in her throat (throat)
White bitch gon' fuck gang, probably 'cause she all off the coke (coke)
I ain't fucking with these niggas, all these bitch niggas, all these niggas hoes (hoes)
You is not gang, nigga, stop tryna call me your bro (call me your bro)
Whoa, call me your bro, whoa, call me your bro
Nigga hating on a nigga, he gon' get knocked off with the scope
And a nigga grill so fresh, so clean like I use Scope
I'm the nigga with the new sound, all these people here tryna cope (woo!)

Whoa (woah), whoa (whoa), they all tryna cope
Yeah (yeah), this the new Boat, nigga, go on and get afloat
Yeah, whoa
Whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lil Boat, Lil Boat
Dick all in her throat, woah (Lil Boat!)

Timmy Chan's chili powder wings, lemon pepper wings for my black bitch
New ring cost 30 thou', did it just 'cause I like to do shit (alright)
And I ain't fond of these new rappers 'cause these new rappers be on that fu' shit (whoa, yeah, damn, whoa)
You're not my bro (no, whoa, nah, damn)
Knocked off with the scope (woah, yeah, woah) (pew, pew, pew)
I keep my dick all in her throat (yeah, whoa, damn, whoa, whoa, yeah)
