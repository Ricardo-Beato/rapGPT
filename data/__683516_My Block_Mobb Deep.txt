5 ContributorsMy Block Lyrics
Yeah, I'm bloodshot, glassey-eyed
Breath smellin' like piff
Wired up fire up another one
Let's get lifty, real dopey
Pour me another cup of that hellfire, watchin' for the police
We outside choppin' it up, shootin' the shit
Couple niggas making bangs, I'm just tryna spit
Some good rap to this bitch that I've been tryna hit
Since we was nineteen, damn, she still fine as shit
Remember at the card tables feelin' on my dick?
Got pregnant by that nigga, I ain't seen her since then
It ain't nothin' like the hood, sittin' on top the benches
You terrified where I'm comfortable in the trenches
Most of my friends is in projects, nigga
Brooklyn, Queens, the whole NY, nigga
Nigga, pull your card like a ATM
Mistook me for fool, found out that I'm poison on the block

A staple in the hood like the liquor store
In the church, I'm cut from a different cloth
The fabric of life in every Hav verse
Pull your cabbage wig worm, I did mad dirt
Deserve this groove so you fear to lose
Have your whole team rockin' R-I-P tattoos, rested and hooked to IVs
N-Y-C, city of the crime scene
Paint a better picture, call me ace Banksy
They scoop you off the floor like fall raked leaves
Nigga, take a knee 'cause this one over
You in the fourth quarter with the reaper on your shoulder
Around every corner or at least most of them
Somebody gettin' money or a chest openin'
The pain so real not even Motrin could take away the pain or save a closest friend
The block
You might also like
What up kid?
You not from 'round here
Outside on the block
Word?
Don't know who you is, man
Right here
Where y'all at? On the block
Out here on the block
Police, police
Niggas stay up in that block2Embed
