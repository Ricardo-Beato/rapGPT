55 ContributorsTake Care Lyrics
Better day, better day
See better days, ayy
Yeah!

A hood girl with a missin' taillight
You got me stopping at the green light, light, yeah
I'll set you good, I'm off a bean, right
And I know you want a savage to give you a ring, right? (So good)

Sexin' on drugs, oh yeah, yeah
Leave a little money on the counter, woah, woah
You remind me of Erykah Badu, you're on go
Thinkin' 'bout masturbating to your nudes, yeah, yeah

Take care!

Ayy, take care, all right
Yeah, she fire right by
Yeah, I'ma sleep with you every night
Ooh-ayy (Yeah, yeah)
Born star
I'm a born star (Uh)
I was a born star
Yeah, a born star (Woo!)

Maison Margiellas, they ain't come with no strings and the jeans Rockafeller (Hol' up)
Wraith umbrella for the hoes in the club when I throw my cheddar (Uh)
She got a Chanel-made bag, I'ma gon' let her, I'ma gon' let her
Everyday I say "Free Yak," lifetime rebel, do it for the fellas
I don't want no bitch annoyin' me
Get on that dick and she rode me
I fuck her hard like she owin' me
Put in this dick, now she moaning
My prices cheaper than Dollar Tree
I mastered math like white collars, B
Open your mouth like you yawning
Double cup featuring Barney
I'm with the dogs and we barking
I'ma take off like a Martian
Fuck her and leave her my mark in
Bust on that hoe, I'm just markin'
Look at these niggas, they markers
Ready for war like a Spartan
You can't block me like I'm Marshawn
My bro got a sound like a marker

A hood girl with a missin' taillight (Missin' taillight)
You got me stopping at the green light, light, yeah
I'll set you good, I'm off a bean, right (Hey)
And I know you want a savage to give you a ring, right?
Take care!

Sexin' on drugs, oh yeah, yeah
Leave a little money on the counter, woah, woah
You remind me of Erykah Badu, you're on go
Thinkin' 'bout masturbating to your nudes, yeah, yeah

Take care!

Born star
Ayy, take care, all right
I'm a born star
Yeah, she fire right by
I was a born star
Yeah, I'm gon' sleep with you every night
Yeah, a born star
Ooh-ayy

Bill Gates, I'm your stepson
I'm so proud to share your genes on your backbone
Thank you God, 2017 new G-Wagon (Skrt skrt)
I play Ring Around the Rosie with my stepson (Oh shit, yeah)
On pu-purple potion
Nigga ain't braggin' or boastin'
Temporary tag and I'm coastin'
All white Porsche like lotion
Everybody checkin' my motion
AP's, Rollies, and Pateks
Broke nigga, stop that madness
And you hoes need to stop that scrambling (Yeah)
Living two minutes from bando
Trip on these hoes, make 'em panic
I did 'em wrong and I meant it
New Derrick Rose and I'm winnin'
About these fuckboys, I'm relentless
I'm tryna put my nut in you really
I'm tryna put my butt in some skinnies
I'm charging my bitch a new Bentley, ayy
A hood girl with a missin' taillight (Think you got a missin' taillight)
You got me stopping at the green light, light, yeah
I'll set you good, I'm off a bean, right
And I know you want a savage to give you a ring, right?

Take care!6Embed
