3 ContributorsPut That Work In Lyrics
Yo I'm tired, son
We gon' do this last one, then I'm out

It's a natural progression, first you cut a nigga
Then you gun-butt a nigga, then you pull the trigger
Put that work in, put that work in
Make it hot, it die down, do the shit again

You know my aunt killed my dog and never said sorry
Niggas broke in my crib and they stole my Atari
Man, niggas could've asked, I would've let 'em hold a cartridge
I wasn't fucking with nobody, see how niggas start shit
Instead selling crack I could've been Tiger Woods
But they ain't got no fucking golf courses in the hood
I said I'm selling dope, I don't regret shit
I'm selling dope, nigga, that good shit
I was supposed to be an A student, a valedictorian
Instead I'm in special ED trying to fuck, I'm horny
They didn't like my style, they said they didn't like my style
Them same bitches want me now
In came the cash, out with the cocaine
Virgin Mary medallion hanging off my rope chain
Four finger ring, nigga doing his thing
You get a couple bitches after you get the bling
You might also like
It's a natural progression, first you cut a nigga
Then you gun-butt a nigga, then you pull the trigger
Put that work in, put that work in
Make it hot, it die down, do the shit again

"Can't read notes but I plaaaaay anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear."

What the fuck?
What the, who the fuck
Who would put this on the beat, man?
That's it, man
This shit is stupid, man
I'm glad this is the last one because
Fuck that man, I'm out man
What time is it?
It's like fucking 4 o'clock in the morning, son
Tuu, for a mixtape, I'm going home, man
Man fuck that, I'm out
This is, they can, this is good enough

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
