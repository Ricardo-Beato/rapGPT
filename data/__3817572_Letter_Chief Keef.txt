K.E. on the Track

Ayy, 'member when my teacher told me I wasn't gon' be shit
Now I can freak her, freak my teacher
'Cause I got the stacks, 'cause I got them racks
And I got dem guns, dem bitches go gratata, click-clack, nigga, brat brat brat, nigga

Never tell me what the fuck I can't be
Should take a trip to fucking Beijing
Lil ass Red Bottoms, niggas babies
I'ma grown boy, boy, you a baby
Even though I'm a baby, I get cakey daily
Got a gun and that's off safety
Mama always told me never let a nigga play me
I'ma get my ass whooped and I couldn't take it

What's the situation, is the situation paper?
If it is, shake up, I'ma earthquake up
Coolin' with the paper, ballin' is my major
She wants some top, wait up, baby, I'll take that
Pull up on the motherfucking label, where my cake at?
'Fore I up this motherfucking chopper and spray it
Fuck rehab, I get high for Bob Marley
Double O-7, bitch, the skies falling
Bought me some Rugers, I was tired of Glock 40s
Put it on Blood, bitch, I'm guap shawty
Put it on cuz, I'm a hot shawty
I'ma burn ya ass, on the spot, shawty
Bananas in the summer, chinchillas in the winter
Heard you was mad 'bout your thot? Nigga, get her
Made it from the bottom to the top, niggas didn't
That's why my mansion two million, niggas bitter
You might also like
Never tell me what the fuck I can't be
Should take a trip to fucking Beijing
Lil ass Red Bottoms, niggas babies
I'ma grown boy, boy, you a baby
Even though I'm a baby, I get cakey daily
Got a gun and that's off safety
Mama always told me never let a nigga play me
I'ma get my ass whooped and I couldn't take it

Heard fuck niggas was plotting on the low
I'm from Chiraq, I be spottin' on the low
I know everything before they thought I didn't know
Pull up on your block poppin' shit, Crisco
I'm Kanye rich now, 'member when I was in the field
Runnin' 'round the blocks, while niggas gettin' killed
Niggas sendin' shots, we gon' send them back
Baby, I'm the driver, I ain't in the back
Pull up in the foreigns, they like, "Who is that?"
On Tooka day, smoking Tooka pack
Pull off and I'm tourin' all the hoodlums, man
Bitch, I'm Yung Joc, I'll do ya bad
Coolin' kit on the gun and it'll cool ya ass
Do this rap shit for fun, let it fool ya ass
Fredo coming out the cut, he gon' do ya ass
Tadoe slow ass, he shot some more times, ayy2Embed
