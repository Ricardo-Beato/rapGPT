22 ContributorsMusical Chairs Lyrics
Ayo
Yo, what up, Jerm?
Beat's crazy
'Bout to get my drink on
Go to one of them high school parties, you know what I'm sayin'? Chyeah

Ayo, if you got a cup, put it up in the air
And if you smokin' on a blunt, better puff it and share
Y'all know you wake up not rememberin' last night
That shorty with the ass like the bottom of a bagpipe
Girl sucked my dick like she was swallowin' a mag light (Chyeah)
Gotta get my cash right, livin' in this fast life (Uh-huh)
I'm fucked up, the room is spinnin', the ceilin' is gone (Gone)
I'm spittin' game on a girl, but I'm feelin' her mom (Mom)
I'm sippin' Crisie, gettin' pissy while killin' in Pong (Pong)
I'm runnin' tables while my peoples are twistin' some bomb (Bomb)
Listen, it's on, I'm the man of the night (Uh-huh)
I shine bright, can you handle the light? (Uh-uh)
They can't stand that I'm white (Chyeah)
With a ego, find me like Nemo
Chillin' with the homies and you know we let the trees blow (Chyeah, chyeah)
Y'all ain't makin' one point like a free throw
Haha, yeah, and the beat go
You might also like
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair (Chyeah)

Party hard, muhfucker, party hard (Yuh, yup)
Have a ball, laugh a little, hardy-har (Hardy-har)
You hardly saw shit, but now I'm all up in your face (Face)
With mixtape money, boy, my wallet is a waste (Waste)
With a rubber band, Dutch with a dozen grams
Smokin' 'til it numbs my head
Now everybody do the runnin' man (Haha)
We takin' it back, it's easy, boy (Yuh, yup)
I'm all three members of the Beastie Boys
So fight, fight for the right to party
Everybody stand up like Steve Harvey
I got surfers like, "Damn, he's gnarly"
And mother's givin' me a free bowl of beef barley (Yup)
Ridin' in the back, back, back on the car seat (Chyeah)
Gettin' out, then pocketin' the car keys
Young and I'm reckless, with blunts with my breakfast
And I'm rockin' more dunks than Garnett gets
Yes, it's Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair (Chyeah)

And I'ma get my diploma (What?)
You need to notice I'm a scholar
Runnin' through the streets ever since I was a toddler (Uh)
Playin' cops and robbers (Uh), always was a robber (Uh)
In my neighborhood all day like Mr. Rogers (Chyeah)
Now a little taller, hip hop monster
Eight-legged flow, you can call me Peter Parker (Peter Parker)
I know you see it, boy, I'm weeded and spittin' it real (Real)
To match my style, kid, you best be equipped with some steel (Steel)
My swagger mean, dress fresh and so clean
In a flash, gettin' change like a vendin' machine (Chyeah)
Then I'm out, pocket of piff, hop in the whip
Head to the first dip at the top of the list (Ayo)
Roll in easy, got you drinks for the free
On lean and my eyes still chink from the tree (From the tree)
Hoes out the playpen, eyes behind some Rayban's
It's mayhem livin' in this teenage wasteland (Chyeah)
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair (Chyeah)
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Move around)
Then move around (Move around)
Get, get, get, get
Get down, get up, get down, get up (Uh-huh)
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around, like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off yourâ€”
