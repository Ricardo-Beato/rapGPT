(Yo, yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
(Metro)
I love you
I don't want you

I don't know what's next, yeah
I don't want my ex, no
Break up with a text
I'm not tryna flex (What? What?)
Girl, you know the rest (Bye-bye, ho)
Bitch, I write a check
Walkin' with a check (With a check)
Take off in a jet (I don't want my ex)
So I just never stress

I could never stress (Stress)
Yeah, my life's a mess (Pew, pew, pew)
But I'm also blessed (Blessed)
My heart's in the junkyard 'cause it's wrecked
And today's not feeling like it used to (Yeah)
You got stuck up in that life that you was used to (Yeah)
If you got hurt, yeah, I got hurt, yeah, I got bruised too (Yeah)
That's the main reason why I had to choose you
If you got options I got options, baby, who you?
I got one that's on my line that look like new new
She got ass just like a zebra on a zoo too
So basically what I'm saying, I'm not scared to lose you
You might also like
I don't want my ex (Ayy, no)
Break up with a text
I'm not tryna flex (What? What?)
Girl you know the, rest (Bye-bye, ho)
Bitch, I write a check
Walkin' with a check (With a check)
Take off in a jet (I don't want my ex)
So I just never stress

Leonardo DiCaprio (Yeah, swag)
Watch out, boys, I might bag your ho (Yeah)
Love so strong, that shit had me gone (Gone)
Didn't care too, I was all alone ('Lone, VLONE)
Swag on them by mistake
I cannot believe that I made this shit from a mixtape (Tape, yeah)
Bitch, you know I'm flooded, then you know my momma wrist straight (Yeah)
Grandma don't like diamonds, she say "Make sure that my rent's paid," yeah
And I make sure that your rent's paid
Make you live your own life when you hung out with Lindsay
I don't want you never ever running in a frenzy
But that's just some shit that everybody friends say

I don't know what's next, yeah (Yeah)
I don't want my ex, no (I don't want her back)
Break up with a text (Break up with a)
I'm not tryna flex (What? What?)
Girl you know the, rest (Bye-bye, ho)
Bitch, I write a check
Walkin' with a check (With a check)
Take off in a jet (I don't want my ex)
So I just never stress
Leonardo DiCaprio
Leonardo DiCaprio

Watch out, boys, I might bag your ho30Embed
