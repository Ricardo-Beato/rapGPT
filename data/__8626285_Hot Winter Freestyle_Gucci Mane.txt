5 ContributorsHot Winter Freestyle Lyrics
(Zaytoven)
('Wop)
(Yeah, Ziggy)
(Yeah, 'Wop, go)

My bank account a zillion (Jump), that's what Gucci be on (Gucci)
Your ex-boyfriend a peon, I don't even see him (Huh?)
Bad bitch look like Kim (Haha), house look like a museum (Wow)
Rolex with the diamond jewelry (Brr), damn near cost a M (Ooh)
Bitches tellin' other bitches "Can't believe it's him" (Ha)
White stretched fur, like a motherfuckin' pimp (Zion)
Trap Gang, they stack, they super fat, but Gucci gettin' slammed (Drippy)
'Wop been in his bag lately, racks been into jail (Ah)
Shaq stacks old money, I just broke the rims (Let's go)
This cap rap, no trap, you got up a dam (Trap)
Them big fats gave mysеlf a budget and a deal ('Wop)
The sound of racks bought himsеlf some diamonds and the grill
Tell MTV to chill (Chill), they can't come to the crib (No)
'Cause I be cookin' deuces up and T be cookin' real (T)
Back and forth with water, whip you, I was takin' trills (M)
Charged the cartridge by so much, it damn near made me flip (Well, damn)
Brought so many niggas there, they damn near got me killed (Huh?)
Sometimes I think of all the shit I did and get the chills (Brr)
So drunk and my ho' soundin' four, like, Jesus, take the wheel (Wasted)
Bitches askin' if I might be, no, I'm on the pill
You might also like
I don't ever say a lot or ever do a lot, I'm him
Nothin' to tell these bitches, goin' off the names
Don't ever get it twisted, supercalifragilistic
I'm that nigga got these milli's off of comin' off the rain
They don't look at me, no stain, I know I'm rich, my bag up high
All this water drippin', see this glass, oh my
Know it might look temptin', but look past me, bye
'Cause you try to rob me, just know your ass gon' die
They mad I'm getting dough-ough, dough dough, dough-ough, dough
Hate to see me glow-ow, glow, glow, glow-ow, glow

See somethin', we blow it, don't run up
Like I'm one of these niggas, 'cause brodie, I'm not
Came up from nothin', they turned me to somethin'
Can't let it right now, it's too early to stop
I know a couple niggas want me dead and I know a couple wanna see me pop
I know a couple niggas really fed and I know they hate to see the boy with the guap (Boom, boom)
Tjay on top, they on my yacht, only on shit when I see 'em, just watch (Watch)
How many niggas gon' diss on the bro 'fore they realize that shit get you put in the box? (Put in the box)
Fuck this shit's hot, gotta keep knots, when you out three-hundred-thousand a watch (Bling)
I got that feelin', I know I'm that nigga, like look at me right now and tell me I'm not
Feelin' my time, now they go insane, I ran up figures, comin' off the brain
Feel like they missed me, rookie of the year, other than that I've been goin' insane
Puttin' in pain, know they throw dirt on my name, that shit just a part of the game
Nothing's the same, no more coolin' by my lonely, that shit just a part of the fame (Boom)
I don't ever say a lot or ever do a lot, I'm him
Nothin' to tell these bitches, goin' off the names
Don't ever get it twisted, supercalifragilistic
I'm that nigga got these milli's off of comin' off the rain
They don't look at me, no stain, I know I'm rich, my bag up high
All this water drippin', see this glass, oh my
Know it might look temptin', but look past me, bye
'Cause you try to rob me, just know your ass gon' die
They mad I'm getting dough-ough, dough dough, dough-ough, dough
Hate to see me glow-ow, glow, glow, glow-ow, glowEmbed
