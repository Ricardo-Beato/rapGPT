60 ContributorsDraw Down Lyrics
I know how to go and get a motherfucking check, no flex
Flawless and VV's all over my neck and my chest (Ah)
I'm a big dog, baby, muhfucka a vet
I don't get sucked unless I'm having sex
Hoes know YSL, they real as it get
No giraffe, but Thugger want nothing but neck
Plus I'ma pull up drawin' down on all of them
I'ma pull up drawin' down on all of them
Pull up drawin' down on all of them (Quick draw McGraw)
I'ma pull up drawin' down on all of them
Nigga, I'm gon' draw down with my gun
Nigga, you might be swept by my sword
Pussy nigga, you's a rat and I'm Tom
Every given Sunday I got falcons

Pull up with that K out of the coupe
I like my bitch brown like her motherfucking boot
I like that ass big like Shaq' tennis shoes
And I want that wig mother fuck your hairdo
Control that ho, no voodoo
I be Thugger Liu Kang, Ryu
Damn I don't wanna hit it again, achoo!
Make a nigga go brazy, cuckoo
Drinking on that diesel like a pig
I don't talk to snitches, you can't tell me nothing
I think I found my new favorite bitch
I'm fucking with Travis Scott, so you can't tell me nothing
Tell me how you feel
I pull up and beat that pussy like the pill
I go Dre Beats on a mother fucking freak
I got white minks on my floor, I killed the sheep
I know you a freak yeah you the skeet meat
I'ma proceed to the T-O-P
I might ball Jerrika ask her where the fuck she started
When these bitches play with her baby, she go retarded
I'm biting, you barking, please tell 'em
You might also like
I know how to go and get a motherfucking check, no flex
Flawless and VV's all over my neck and my chest
I'm a big dog, baby, muhfucka a vet
I don’t get sucked unless I'm having sex
Hoes know YSL, they real as it get
No giraffe, but Thugger want nothin' but neck
Plus I'ma pull up drawin' down on all of them
I'ma pull up drawin' down on all of them
Pull up drawin' down on all of them (Quick draw McGraw)
I'ma pull up drawin' down on all of them
Nigga I'm gon' draw down with my gun
Nigga you might be swept by my sword
Pussy nigga you's a rat and I'm Tom
Every given Sunday I got falcons

Every given Sunday I got birds on the one-way, yeah, the Con-Way
Dreads braided to the back like a motherfucking cliché
When she tell me it's too fucking fast I'm like no way
Please don't ask if I wanna see it, I'm like show it
Baby girl show me that pussy, show it
And I ain't Future or Rocko but they know it
Yeah they know it, niggas know it
I can go all day like a fucking poet
House full of weed, drink fucking Moet
I can let my brother kill ya, nigga, Thugger muncher
Better know she popping if Young Thug approach her
I done bought me so much water bitch I'm overdosing
My car don't come with keys and your key a token
I bought a black Cuban link look like I'm choking
I don't like to talk, bitch, I'm not a spokesman
I do not want that head bitch, I want that throat and
If she get that dick hard you know I'm pokin'
Put that pussy on my head like a fucking Motrin
My diamonds still moving when I'm not in motion
I pour fours of the Act' in phantoms and toast it
I love green so much all my money fucking moldy
Hi Benjamin, Grant, Jackson, I'm just focused
I know how to go and get a motherfucking check, no flex
Flawless and VV's all over my neck and my chest
I'm a big dog, baby, muhfucka a vet
I don't get sucked unless I'm having sex
Hoes know YSL, they real as it get
No giraffe, but Thugger want nothin' but neck
Plus I'ma pull up drawin' down on all of them
I'ma pull up drawin' down on all of them
Pull up drawin' down on all of them (Quick draw McGraw)
I'ma pull up drawin' down on all of them
Nigga, I'm gon' draw down with my gun
Nigga, you might be swept by my sword
Pussy nigga, you's a rat and I'm Tom
Every given Sunday I got falcons17Embed
