6 ContributorsOh Yea Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, alright
104
Oh yeah
Yeah, what's up?
Uh, uh

Oh yeah, why the nigga gun on him?
Why his AK got a drum on it?
Oh yeah, why the nigga still in the game?
Why the nigga sell cocaine?
Oh yeah, why you still sell crack? (Crack)
Why the nigga still in the trap (Huh?)
Oh yeah, why the nigga still in the hood?
And hang with niggas up to no good? Oh yeah

Dropped two-fifty on the vert
And I got it all out the dirt
Oh yeah, feds hit the spot on the first
12 lost two when it hurt (Goddamn)
Oh yeah, caught a cell charge, made bail
Then I went and bought me a scale
Oh yeah, is the nigga blind? I can't tell
He readin' them bricks like braille
Oh yeah, dawg touched down from the feds
Say he 'bout to dig up his bread
Oh yeah, chopper get to choppin' 'bout the bread
Cost that boy an arm and a leg
Oh yeah, used to get the Remy out of trunks
I was really, really, really in the hood
Oh yeah used to get the bricks from Lauderdale
When I'm down there I'm really, really good

Oh yeah, why the nigga gun on him?
Why his AK got a drum on it?
Oh yeah, why the nigga still in the game?
Why the nigga sell cocaine?
Oh yeah, why you still sell crack? (Crack)
Why the nigga still in the trap (Huh?)
Oh yeah, why the nigga still in the hood?
And hang with niggas up to no good? Oh yeah

Rolex before the record deal (Swear to God, nigga)
Traphouse did five mil'
Why these niggas don't like me?
And yet they tryna be just like me
Oh yeah, came straight from the dope game
Still smellin' like a whole thing
My wrist sore, I need some Rogaine
Flex dancin' like Soul Train
How you want it, nine or the TEC?
The money counter faster than a jet
Oh yeah, bitch called twice, she got nerves, man
95 South, she got curves, man
Started off hustling on the curb, man
Hit 'em with the brrt, bought a bird, man
Oh yeah, you either get it or you got it
Just know you can't live without it (What's up?)
Oh yeah, why the nigga gun on him?
Why his AK got a drum on it?
Oh yeah, why the nigga still in the game?
Why the nigga sell cocaine?
Oh yeah, why you still sell crack? (Crack)
Why the nigga still in the trap (Huh?)
Oh yeah, why the nigga still in the hood?
And hang with niggas up to no good? Oh yeah

You already know what this shit is, nigga (Oh yeah)
Either you got it or you don't
Either you got it or you gon' go get it, nigga
Oh yeah, what? Yeah

But we still movin' like that though
Huh, woop

Why the nigga sell cocaine?
