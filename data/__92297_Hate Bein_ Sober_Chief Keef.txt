Young Chop on the beat
I can't spell sober
I'm a smoker, Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
Sober, my bitches stay sober
Sober
Damn, I hate bein' sober
I hate bein' sober

Damn, I hate bein' sober, I'm a smoker
Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
But we can't spell sober
Ballout roll up, when we roll up, bitches be on us
All the hoes, they love smokin' and love drinkin'
Anti-sober for no reason
'Cause we can't spell sober
Y'all know us, we smoke strong, bruh
Watch me roll up
'Cause I can't spell sober

On my tour bus we get dumb high, you's a floor boy
Fredo got a hangover, he totin' a Cobra
Last night he was shootin' shit up like O-Dog
Reese rollin', Tadoe got hoes on mollies
Chief Sosa, Ballout, we high ridin' 'Raris
My bitches love drinkin', some love smokin'
Let my alcoholic bitch hit the dutch, she start chokin'
Call up D-Money, now we throw money
All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies
Call up D-Money, now we throw money
All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies, yeah

Damn, I hate bein' sober, I'm a smoker
Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
But we can't spell sober
Ballout roll up, when we roll up, bitches be on us
All the hoes, they love smokin' and love drinkin'
Anti-sober for no reason
'Cause we can't spell sober
Y'all know us, we smoke strong, bruh
Watch me roll up
'Cause I can't spell sober
We got a hundred pounds of this shit (Yeah)
My stash house with them bricks (Yeah)
My pockets filled with them stacks (Uh)
My bitch be gone off a flat (Whoo)
She a hot tamale when she pop a molly
It's time to party, we party hard
Drinkin', smokin', drinkin', smokin', drinkin', smokin'
We high for sure
I came in back of that Rolls
Nigga, I ain’t stuntin' them hoes (Nah)
I trick a bitch to suck dick, trick
What you spend on her, we spend on clothes
Too young for me, she want Sosa
Shooters in the Range Rover
That's GBE, when them .223's get to flyin', bitch, it's over
See my ring chain and my Rolex when I’m flexin'
Bitch, I got to get mine, nigga get outta line, I check 'em
See this gangsta shit's done to perfection
Nigga, better believe me, I make it look easy
Damn, I hate bein' sober, I'm a smoker
Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
But we can't spell sober
Ballout roll up, when we roll up, bitches be on us
All the hoes, they love smokin' and love drinkin'
Anti-sober for no reason
'Cause we can't spell sober
Y'all know us, we smoke strong, bruh
Watch me roll up
'Cause I can't spell sober

Uh, uh, uh
My weed so strong, my cheese so long (My cheese so long)
Roll so many joints, soon I might need a lung (Might need a lung)
Spend so many grands that I might need some bands (Might need some bands)
That's your bitch, why she actin' like she need a man? (Need a man)
I’m faded (Faded), talkin' mill's 'cause I made it (Made it)
Talkin' pounds 'cause I smoke it (Smoke it)
Talkin' game 'cause I played it (I played it)
I’m wasted (Wasted), Rose thats my favorite (Favorite)
OG kush, you can taste it (Taste it)
Buying Cris' by the cases (By the cases)
I hate being sober
Don't smell no one smokin', me and my niggas gon' roll up
Believe they gon' fire on you
You think you could roll up
You smoke by the ounce
Well, bitch, I smoke by the pound 'cause
Damn I hate bein' sober (Hahaha), I'm a smoker
Fredo a drinker (Uh), Tadoe off molly water
But we can't spell sober (Sosa, what up nigga?)
Ballout roll up (What up Fredo?), when we roll up, bitches be on us
All the hoes, they love smokin' and love drinkin'
Anti-sober for no reason
'Cause we can't spell sober
Y'all know us, we smoke strong, bruh
Watch me roll up
