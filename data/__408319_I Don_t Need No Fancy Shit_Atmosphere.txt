I don't need no fancy shit
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"
Look down at where you standing, it's
A thin line between hand and fist
I don't need no fancy shit
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"
I'm an example of a man convinced
So let the planet spin and I'ma grab the wind
I don't need no fancy shit
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"
And you don't know what the answer is
Nobody knows what that answer is

Peter was my peeps who used to sell weed
Even though he didn't need to
He says he did it for the free smoke
But honestly he would've rather had a speed boat
Or a snowmobile or whatever
See the point is he didn't move enough to make a treasure
Never could have guessed that Pete would make a little impression
On a middle aged detective named Hamm
No irony, yeah Hamm
He didn't come to put the cuffs on your hands
He landed with a duffle and a plan but
Pete couldn't eat all of Hamm's demands
It was an awkward spot, officer thought
That Peter would be sittin' on a lot more crop
He did such a bad job at bein' a bad cop
That its obvious to me that the reason that he robbed him was Sidney
Sid was a sick kid that needed a kidney
The grandson, son of Hamm's son
You do what you gotta do for your fam son
Doesn't take a rocket scientist but I am one
The situation showed the pig for who he truly is
And gave the dealer an excuse to quit
And since Sid's Physician is Peter's father
You should mind your business, don't be a bother
Okay

I don't need no fancy shit
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"
Look down at where you standing, it's
A thin line between hand and fist
I don't need no fancy shit
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"
I'm an example of a man convinced
So let the planet spin and I'ma grab the wind
I don't need no fancy shit
I'm only askin' ya: "Can I live?"
And you don't know what the answer is
Nobody knows what that answer is2Embed
