15 ContributorsEye Patch Lyrics
Thank you, thank you
And for my latest basket of cheers, here it goes, baby!

Mess up my mind, mess up my mind
Mess up my mind with the eye patch
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind
Mess up my mind with the eye patch
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind
Mess up my mind with the eye patch
(Everything I do gonna be funky)

Channeling in sync so my would bring (What!)
With that causin' all fat
I'm responsible for ya diet (Keep it quiet!)
Yo I got beats, state this stitch on my national fabric
My daughter will speak the Arabic that's how I live
Levitate to my nation when holding up your nickels
I pie like crumble so I Don like Rickles
Like green on the pickle
My papes are the up, master of the cabbage patch
Ya' eyes got the latch
So catch the cut, I hold the rut
For the people's reminder when in Maseo Path
I be the finder of the patch

Can the cat's tongue slip, ya' do the 'da zip'
Take the horse into the jolly ranch
Keep the hush (*whistle*)
The good, the bad, and Uncle Tom, beat it kid (Ahh!)
Do-doot-doot-do-do-do-do-do
Show the sheep cause I found the fool
When I string the man with the eye patch, the eye patch
When I'm walkin' it and could ya' make it go sha-na-na-na

Mmm, it sniffs good
Punks show disguises while I'm standing on the wood
I be the in, cause the brotha' holdin' Glocks is out
I be the in, cause the pusha' runnin' blocks is out
I be the in cause the kid smokin' weed, shootin' seed which leads to a girl's stomach bein' 'bout a half a ton is out
Show the fingerprint and give me good grief for my lumber
Pants will sag cause my license as a plumber
Feel the Plug (Yo, something's wrong here)
Now give a shout

Yo what's up, I'd like to give a holler to Big 4-7 off in the Oakenone!
And I bring an income in to my baby girl Twyla in White Plains and all my peoples out in Delaware
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I'd like to give a shout out to all those rappers who dissed us on record, and I wanna let you know you're still wack
And oh yeah, I ain't mention no names cause you might f-
(Hold it, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were going back to that)
(Ecoutez. Ecoutez.)1Embed
