17 ContributorsPuff Lyrics
Tell a nigga something, ho, Tell a nigga something ho!
(Good work, Charlie!)

Okay, lots of the money, bet it though
Bet you can’t take nothing from me
Back in 10th grade when I had the Gumby
Now I'm 19 and I still got the gun, b
Got the 9 millimeter and pack in the undies
If you my son how the fuck you got son me
Bitch said she love me but hoe I don’t love you
If you for real thot, I do not love you, I just wanna fuck you
Got me a piece of the puzzle
You can bring your friend I don’t wanna cuddle
If she from motor ball then her friend scoop it up then its right back to the huddle
So many hoes it look like an army, they march to my dick like hut two
And rifle with knife on the end of it so when I run out of bullets I cut you
She ask me my name and I said they call me Vert
Double Cup full of mud mouth full of dirt
If it ain't xanny them I'm on the purp
Sippin' the syrup now I'm slurring words
Look in the mirror, now I see a curse
When I saw cara she looked good at first
Now I see models that bitch be the worst
Now I see models that bitch be the worst

Tell a nigga, tell a nigga something hoe
If I ain’t eating why I’m living so comfortable
And if I ain't skeetin' I never claimed I fucked a hoe
All these bitches at my concert I’m bout to fuck the show
Tell a nigga, tell a nigga something hoe
If I ain't eating why I'm living so comfortable
And if I ain't skeetin' I never claimed I fucked a hoe
All these bitches at my concert I’m bout to fuck the show

Okay shoutout to Dre shoutout to Tina
They getting married in Jamaica next season
I’m gonna be there with 26 women
Once I touch down yeah I probably ain't leaving
Lot of these rappers yeah they got some secrets
I ain't with  cause a nigga be feasting
Got bitches butt naked going out to eat and
Niggas they change on you just like seasons
Lil Uzi Vert yeah that nigga a demon
Fuckin' yo bitch and she eatin' my semen
Niggas be hatin' because they get eaten
She ain't got asthma but I leave her wheezin'
Sweating me heavily bitch keep on breathin'
Vicki and Ebony they keep on screamin'
I keep on skeetin'
Calling on jesus, in the two seater
Lean by the liter
I can not fuck with a bitch
If she ain’t fuckin' the clique, if she ain't sucking a dick
After I'm done Vert be ducking her quick
Working the back with the fifth
Ain’t got the cash, I ain't fronting you shit
Drinking on lean I ain't puffing a spliff
Watch getting loose cause I'm flexing the wrist
And you on the phone while I’m texting the bitch
And I be blessing a bitch when she licking the tip
And you be kissing that bitch like, Uzi ain’t nut on her lips
I be a dog, every bitch know I'm a pimp
Minus the ring and the cane and the limp
Benihana eating lobster and shrimp
What I paid for these is probably your rent
Tell a nigga, tell a nigga something hoe
If I ain't eatin' why I'm living so comfortable
And if I ain't skeetin I never claimed I fucked a hoe
All these bitches at my concert I'm bout to fuck the show
Tell a nigga, tell a nigga something hoe
If I ain't eatin' why I’m living so comfortable
And if I ain't skeetin' I never claimed I fucked a hoe
All these bitches at my concert I’m bout to fuck the show3Embed
