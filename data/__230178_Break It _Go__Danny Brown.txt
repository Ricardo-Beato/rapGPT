26 ContributorsBreak It (Go) Lyrics
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)

Who the fuck is you fucking with, I been in the dirt like a catcher's mitt
I'm activist on Actavis, won't smack a bitch, but I'm like a pimp
Long-ass cutty, eating lots of shrimp, got a wig and bring it back
She go in and bring it back and make that booty go *clap-clap*
Ain't no way gonna sleep with a whitey, rob my nigga, ho so furry
Ghetto Bill Murray, that's a whole 'nother story
What a nightmare, when you see talking to your chick
Put this in your nose, ho, then start sniffing
Put this on your tongue, ho, then start licking
Y'all niggas shrooming, y'all better fall back
And my loud got niggas go *clap-clap*
Ain't no time to be playing, spit champagne when you hear what I'm saying
Exhale kush when I breathe on the mic, everytime I rock like a diamond heist
Drop the lights when I drop the jewel, roll up bush and call it blue groovy
I'm just tryna say bring it back, drop it down and go *clap-clap*

With that work, we make it twerk, don't end up on your homeboy's shirt
Cause you popped you a pill, now you feeling like a ho, now go berserk
I'm just tryna see her shake it, shake it, don't stop girl, just break it, break it
Stick it out, then bring it back, make that booty go *clap-clap*

(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it

Girl, just give me your all
Girl, just give me your all
Girl, just give me your all
Hell no, you can't have it all

She had me on that wall, drink in my hand with her ass on my balls
Sweating, hot, and we rolling, phone off service, got a couple missed calls
Girl, don't stop just get it, get it, after this, ho, I'mma lick it, lick it
Rubbing on your stomach while I'm kissing on your neck
Thing getting hard while I'm rubbing on your breasts
Girl, you make me wanna do things, when you grind all on that ding-a-ling
Make me wanna rip off your pants, put my hand between your legs
Rubbing on them nipples, wanna make that pussy dribble
Wanna bend that ass over then hit it from the back
Girl make that booty go *clap-clap*
With that work, we make it twerk, don't end up on your homeboy's shirt
Cause you popped you a pill, now you feeling like a ho, now go berserk
I'm just tryna see her shake it, shake it, don't stop girl, just break it, break it
Stick it out, then bring it back, make that booty go *clap-clap*

(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it

Girl, just give me your all
Girl, just give me your all
Girl, just give me your all
Hell no, you can't have it all8Embed
