32 ContributorsIt May Be Glamour Life Lyrics

It's royalty
It's royalty

Hey world, this is lollipop, raps for the sweet tooth
The real fiends who want that GhostFace and Sheek Louch
Big chain changlin' charms, they be danglin'
Eighty thou worth of the ice, I'll strangle 'em
My raw fish scale, paid the jeweler named Ishmael
Had to eagle fly back to my wrist
Bigger chips, bigger wings, bigger rings
I'm with the Childish Gambino
On that Eastwood shit, pushin' a Gran Torino
Tarantino don't got reservoir dogs like mine
Thirty six different niggas with the same state of mind
Dirty Ghetto Kids lovin' them haters
We got skaters that'll ox your whole face off
Rob you like Madoff
Drug kingpins on the diet, we get that weight off
Real hood niggas snatch a bitch and clean your plate off
Gambino rap, cash money crack, table casino
Precision cut emeralds, sapphire visualsYou might also like2Embed
