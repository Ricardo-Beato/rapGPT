It's a blue world without you
It's a blue world alone

Yeah, well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, mhm, yeah

Okay, cool as fall weather, fuck your bullshit
I'm here to make it all better with a little music for you
I don't do enough for you
Without you, it's the color blue, ooh, don't trip
I was in the city, they was talkin' that shit
Had the homies with me, all a sudden, they split
We ain't even worried, we just laughin', that's rich
You know how it goes, it ain't broke, don't fix

Hey, one of these days
We'll all get by
Don't be afraid
Don't fall
You might also like
Think I lost my mind
Reality's so hard to find
When the devil tryna call your line, but shit, I always shine
Even when the light dim
No, I ain't God, but I'm feelin' just like Him, ooh, don't trip
See, I was in the whip, ridin', me and my bitch
We was listenin' to us, no one else, that's it
That's a flex, just a bit, let me talk my shit
Say my head got big, yeah

Yeah
Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, mhm

Don't trip
Don't trip
Don't trip
Well, if you could see me now
Love me and hold me down
My mind, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes
Yeah
Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, uh

Hey, one of these days
We'll all get by
Don't be afraid
Don't fall in line35Embed
