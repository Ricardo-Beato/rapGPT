7 ContributorsLeave Me Alone Lyrics
Leave me alone
Y'all ever heard of that term
What's it called, uh
Fatal attraction
Well this story right here
It's like that
Thin line between love and hate times ten
You be the judge

She sent me one-hundred and fifty letters sayin' we should be together
And how we should meet each other, when are we gon' see each other
Blowin' up my phone, I ain't even give my number
Leavin' voicemails to my fuckin' brother and my mother
Photoshopping pictures with me and my sister on it
Cut my little sister's head off and stuck her picture on it
She tatted Future Joyner on her titties and her stomach
Tellin' me that if we fuck she  for my brothers
Middle of the night she was in my fuckin' dreams
With a knife tellin' me that "It ain't really what it seems
I'll slice your fuckin' throat nigga, don't you even scream
Future Joyner don't you love me baby, we can be a team
Stick together, you and me forever, Batman and Robin
Or I'll cut your fuckin' dick off like I'm Lorena Bobbitt"
I woke up, jumped in the whip and tried to leave
But she was in the backseat with my keys like "Uh-uh-uh
It's you and me"

Leave me alone
Bitch, leave me alone

Leave me alone

She snuck in my hotel room
Lookin' all seductive, almost fell for it
Put my phone in her panties, tied me to the headboard
Shoved a pill down my throat and then my body felt sore
I woke up in the prison right before they shut the cell door
"Officer what fuck?" he said "Nigga listen
Since you wanna rape women, you gon' be somebody's bitch" and
I was trippin' like "Nigga what? You got it fucked up"
He said "Keep your mouth shut, pussy, tell it to the judge"
I went to court the next day, she was in the stands
Slipped the cuffs of my hand, then I ran, goddamn
Took a right down the alley, gettin' chased by the feds
Made it to my nigga's house and she was layin' in the bed like
"You can't run from me Future, don't you understand
I'm your number one fan, what about our fuckin' plans?"
I said "Bitch, you a crazy schizophrenic heffer leave
Won't you let me fuckin' breathe?" She said "Uh-uh-uh
It's you and me" *gunshot*
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me alone
Bitch, leave me alone
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me alone
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me alone
Uh Uh Uh Uh
