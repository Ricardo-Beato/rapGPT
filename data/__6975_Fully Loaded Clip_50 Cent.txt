21 ContributorsFully Loaded Clip Lyrics

While Jay and Beyonc√© was *mm mm* kissin'
I was cookin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
While Nas was tellin' Kelis "I love you boo"
I was shinin' my nine, you know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip

You want a problem with me? - no problem, it's all good
I ain't fresh out the hood, I'm still in the hood
Black rims, black hemi, nigga see me when ya see me
I appear and disappear with the heater like a genie
That party and bullshit'll get ya ass popped
Don't believe me - ask Fab, they got his head shot
I'm in the cut like germs, I do dirt like worms
Smoke on weed not on sherm, nigga it's my turn
I fire on ya ass, them hollow-tips burn, baby burn
I'm screaming "Fuck the cops!", riding 'round with my Glock
There's my pistol on my bitch, nigga fuck that box
That's how P. got knocked, thats's a jewel I drop
But you ain't peep that nigga, go 'head, repeat that nigga
You might learn a little something if you learn to stop fronting
I make it look easy on three piece bb's
Rolling locc-ing, up early with the dopemen
You might also like
When Janet and Jermaine was *mm mm* kissing
I was bagging one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Puffy was telling Kim "I love you boo"
I was shining my nine, ya know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip

At the dice game I bet it all, you hear what I'm saying?
Take grand, I form better, nigga I ain't playing
I'm trying to get it, holla at me if ya with it
And lace up the Chukkas, we can rob these motherfuckers
My stomach is growling, they say that I'm wildin'
I'm doing my numbers, I'm getting violent
They hearing me rap and they thinking I'm playin'
Till they see the barrel and they see the flame
I need full co-operation man, give us the chain
The watch, the ring and the grill, we ain't playin'
I fire that thing, it sound insane
Holla, I got that nose candy, mane

When Jeezy and Keisha was *mm mm* kissin'
I was bagging one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Trina was telling Wayne, "I love you boo"
She was just running games, she told Buck that too,
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
Now nigga, let me show ya how I do this right here
Now, the Ruger hold 16
I put 16 in the clip, I put it in, I cock that
One in the head, I take the clip out
I put another one in it the clip, I put it back
That was Big with all that "let the bullets breathe"
I need a fully loaded clip4Embed
