2 ContributorsThe Release Lyrics
Are you ready?

Hell yeah, I'm ready. My bags is packed
Let's get out of here

Jesus, what's with the clothes?

Man, fuck you, you don't know nothing about this
'95, '96? This was the shit! You crazy?

Well, my boy, in case nobody told you, it's 2001
Here, give my brother another call when you get home
He owns a bunch of stores in the five boroughs
They sell all that FUBA, Sean Jean, Prat Farm
You know, all that stuff you people wear

Man, fuck you, "You people"
'Talkin that shit, man

So tell us, Ace
How does it feel to be coming out after all this time?You might also likeEmbed
