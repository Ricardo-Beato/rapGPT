I waited all my life to play
I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain

Freedom, we can use some of that especially where we from
Where we grew up like a green thumb
It's like a criminal is the only thing you can become
Look at what I became
Something like a phenom, Nuthin' but a G Thang
Things I've seen when I'm looking out of these frames
Pictures I painted on the walls where we hang
From the trees we hung
Strange fruit man look at how we swung
How the hell you gonna tell a son
Who ain't have a father
How to try to grow up and be one
See, um, feel it in my bones
That I'm sitting on a throne
Like a killer with a chrome
When I spit another poem
Shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home, pow!

I waited all my life to play
I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain

Super Swah, the cape remains, thought I was M.I.A no paper?
Planes, I'm fly plus I don't write no more, its all off of the top I shaved the braids
And stayed sharp mother knew how to raise-a-blade (Razor Blade)
I paid my dues now I wait for change and the flows so rude it goes without...
Ask Lupe I'm Sucre, I aid the break
Quick to cut off any baggage like some samurai, I like to travel light
I've gotta leave you at home Delilah
This is Samson-ite
No case for the police
Said I know Killah's, I never seen them
Ghostface, only time I'm watching is my Panerai
I've got an alibi
I was taking pics in Chicago, call me Camera Chi

I waited all my life to play
I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
Chain broke, nicorette for your chain smoke
No cigarrettes on my plane, yo
Snatching herringbones from the game throat
Put it on mine, take a long time
B.A. Baracus is how I'm looking online
In the webisode, necklace stole, let 'em know
That I put up the footage that I'm takin' your shine
Wanna see the real chains? Look in your mind
Your brain look like Keenan Wayans, brother
Overgold, overload, broken soul
Niggas playing games in the hood they got you stuck-up
Playa thinkin' that its cool to be a pimp still
We gon' set it free like a fish in a pimp heel
Take this home, rearrange it, change it
Danger, Sway-zer, Lupe Laser. Pow!

I waited all my life to play
I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain4Embed
