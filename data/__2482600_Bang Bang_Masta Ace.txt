4 ContributorsBang Bang Lyrics
Stick 'em up, bang bang, everybody gang bang
East Coast, West Coast, South, doing the same thang
Give it up, put it down, turn around, on the ground
Mama  ain't no safe place to hang man
Stick 'em up, bang bang, everybody gang bang
East Coast, West Coast, North, doing the same thang
Give it up, put it down, turn around, on the ground
Yves Saint-Laurent frames, give me your chain man

The bus stopped over there, near Vanderveer
A bad block and the whole flock was standing there
On the corner, hanging like a chandelier
A bunch of lions and we felt like a band of deer
With no antlers, bunch of sitting ducks
Everyday after school somebody getting stuck
And it always cause sort of a fuss
Then they ran across the street and they boarded the bus
A pack of wolves, pack of tools we hopefully won't have to use
But will if needed to, we a distinguished group of schemers
All we want is a chain or two, if you got the latest Gucc
You already know what we came to do
Dude hiding his Ewings, we ain't into taking shoes
All lies, you will be alright, just obey the rules
Stay down or lay down, just relax
And take off the butter leather or I melt you, facts
You might also like
Stick 'em up, bang bang, everybody gang bang
East Coast, West Coast, South, doing the same thang
Give it up, put it down, turn around, on the ground
 ain't no safe place to hang man
Stick 'em up, bang bang, everybody gang bang
East Coast, West Coast, North, doing the same thang
Give it up, put it down, turn around, on the ground
Yves Saint-Laurent frames, give me your chain man

In these days got to watch your back
Cause you never can tell how some people act
This world is so cold, seems the love is all gone
You wanna let go but you got to hold on
Ghetto life plaques, police is on attack
No metal where you going, no metal where you at
This world is so cold got to keep the steel close
Cause you never really know when you let the shots go

Dude with the Cazal's on, take those and the frown off
Your face right now pa
You wanna look hardcore, I'mma show you the opposite
You are soft, like the quiet storm
I make it rain with the firearm
Will make you Sweat like Keith, pleading inside a song
Will Make It Last Forever like Right and a Wrong Way
Maybe if you cry to moms, she'll console you and even buy you more
All I know is what I got I ain't giving up
So they can sell it, get the money and live it up
In my right coat pocket got a starter pistol
And I'mma pull it on everybody who got an issue
But I hope it don't come to that
This ain't the Olympics and I ain't into running track
But I don't have to play Carl Lewis
Cause they decide to Rob Saul cuz Saul jewish
In these days got to watch your back
Cause you never can tell how some people act
This world is so cold, seems the love is all gone
You wanna let go but you got to hold on
Ghetto life plaques, police is on attack
No metal where you going, no metal where you at
This world is so cold got to keep the steel close
Cause you never really know when you let the shots go

Stick 'em up, bang bang, everybody gang bang
East Coast, West Coast, South, doing the same thang
Give it up, put it down, turn around, on the ground
 ain't no safe place to hang man
Stick 'em up, bang bang, everybody gang bang
East Coast, West Coast, North, doing the same thang
Give it up, put it down, turn around, on the ground
Yves Saint-Laurent frames, give me your chain manEmbed
