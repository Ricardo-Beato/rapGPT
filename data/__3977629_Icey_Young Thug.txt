Yeah, la, la
It's just funny how I do you, haha
Richard Mille make 'em pukey, ah-ah-ah
Gotta a tiny booty hoochie, wah-wah-wah

Woah, I told her she a Thug wannabe
Woah, Demon Hellcat and I'm tearin' up the streets
Woah, I got that gun, they can't pat on me
Woah, I tote a brand new bag on me
Woah, I beat the bitch up in Givenchy
Woah, I bought the stadium, don't need no seats
Woah, and I got cadence and real nice teeth
Woah, bitch, brown like cocoa, the real ice tea (Ooh)
Your Louboutin heels, you're never gon' wear Nike's (Ooh)
I done left you for years, this shit still the same, I see (Ooh)
For now, I ain't standin' no Nike's (Oh, oh, oh)
My bitch is a Virgo but she actin' like a Pisces

Twist up
Backwoods not no Swisher Sweet 'cause we get up
Fuck her every fucking weekend, catch up
Calamari dinner with a cougar, woah-woah
I'ma fuck her 'til she's purple Hoover, what up?
You can't waste none of my time, bitch, I'm up
I got way too many money, I'm up
You can ask my Mommy
Pourin' up this Dom P (Pour up-up-up)
Put a ring 'round your finger, charisma (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I left twenty-five thousand on your dresser (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I told her ain't this cool, on like Tesla (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dropped outta school then pulled up in a Tesla (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All my girlfriends are real done (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I told her, "Baby, don't waste my time" (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I put your ring on rocks, uh (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woah, I told the bitch I want icy teeth
