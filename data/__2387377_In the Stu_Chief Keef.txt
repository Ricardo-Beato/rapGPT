(Why you just ditching?)
I'm, I'm due the studio, let me work goofy, bye man, damn
Bitch, you acting like you slow
(Wha- What? What are you doing?)
I don't know
(Why is it dark?)

Bitch, I'm in the stu
I'm working, I need to get a coupe
Need a Rarri, and a Bugatti
Need a gun with a few bodies
Need some Benjis in my pocket
Need my fuckin' rocket like I'm Yao
I need a house with ten models
I need some weed and some bottles

I need a bitch that gone come through, give me dumb throat
I kicked her out, she thought she wasn't a thot, but she's a dumb hoe
My niggas get them guns, we comin' through shootin' like Rambo
I come through with this K and he wrestlin' like Rhino
Pull up in that red Bimmer, they lookin' like I'm Damu
What I see? Bunch of hatin' niggas and a bunch fine hoes
I pull up on up on 'em, skrrt skrrt skrrt, like, "Get in my car, hoe"
She gon' Google what I do, always grindin' Tony Hawk, hoe

Bitch, I'm in the stu
I'm working, I need to get a coupe
Need a Rarri, and a Bugatti
Need a gun with a few bodies
Need some Benjis in my pocket
Need my fuckin' rocket like I'm Yao
I need a house with ten models
I need some weed and some bottles

They like, "Who the fuck Sosa think he is, he think he Ginobli"
I got five kids and five rings like Kobe
I was ridin' smokin' dope, then woo-woo the police
I'm eatin' good, 'member when I was so bony
When you gettin' money, niggas swear that you act so phony
I ain't goin' nowhere, baby girl, so please don't sleep on me
I got my forty, I got my homies
Them be my brodies, I mean my GLOdies
And they some gloyalty
Niggas ain't loyal, niggas no loyalty

Bitch, I'm in the stu
I'm working, I need to get a coupe
Need a Rarri, and a Bugatti
Need a gun with a few bodies
Need some Benjis in my pocket
Need my fuckin' rocket like I'm Yao
I need a house with ten models
I need some weed and some bottles2Embed
