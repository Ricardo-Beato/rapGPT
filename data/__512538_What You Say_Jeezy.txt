Gon head nigga act silly, Let the choppa  Wet Willies
We cooking chickens in the back, like we at Chili's
All my niggas still up in there, Fuck you gon Free Willy
I bought my gold for the gold diggers
Learned about the whip game from the old niggas
They like why they call him Snow? Cause he cold nigga
Singin' Yayo songs..J. Cole nigga OK
Two bricks in one car
Bout to get 'em butt naked like a porn star
You know I put 'em back together like a mixtape
Have 'em jumpin' off the shelf like a sextape
If it jumpin' back right, then the sex great
Two of them cutie , got 'em looking like a pancake
Half a million dollar play with a handshake
Chick the person of the check  til your hand ache OK
All good, need a ace band
And buy 4s all day he the eight man
You really gettin that cake, then you the cake man
You really whippin' them pies, you the bake man

One time i re'd up with a half a ticket
Nigga fucked my order up, bout a half a chicken
Ya check always right, how can we help you King?
I said, Yea, I can name 18 things OK
500 in a ziploc, some man say he dropped it off in his flip flops
You know we peeled the top back like a T top
Watch the money starting coming, hit the G spot OK
This is something you should understand
When the work drop, same color rubber band
For my ghetto superstar, that really got fans
Let it sit up on the counter, catch a damn tan OK
Stove on and the water running
The yayo told the soda, look the water coming
It's gonna be a lil cool, be prepared
Nigga whatever you do, dont be scared!
I'm bout to get a cooking show on Netflix
And Ima call that motherfucker yea The Best Bricks
Cause it ain't no limit to this shit, Mia X bitch
