5 ContributorsWhat What Lyrics
Ayy, whatcha gonna do, huh?

(What what) What what
Let flavor rip it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what
What what
Let flavor rip it up
And if you step too close to the microphone
Your bitch ass might get caught

When Flav starts to get busy
Grabbin' the mic and they say, "Who is he?"
Cock diesel breakdown like Bill Bixby
When I think, yo I think in 360
Gimme the mic an I'ma solve all mystery
I dare any punk to try to step up and diss me
Cause when he do, that's when he kiss thee
Titles go by and my style is fly
One more time I came here to rhyme
Gimme the mic and I'ma go for mine
So emcees, alla y'all shut up
When Flavor's in the house we say
You might also like
What what
Let flavor rip it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what
What what
Let flavor blow it up
And if you step too close to the microphone
Your bitch ass might get caught

Now when I do my Flavor dance
All the ladies go crazy in a trance
Non-stop boy, from the clock on my watch
I can bring it from the bottom and take it to the top
Let me rock, come on let me get with it
When I tell you what to get, don't get offended
Gimme the mic and I'ma bend it
Transmissions from the sky, yo I'll send it
Times on my hands, yo sometimes I lend it
Though I'm spendin' it for a fact
I'll make you say "What what" cause Flavor's back

What what
Let flavor rip it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what
What what
Let flavor blow it up
And if you step too close to the microphone
Your bitch ass might get caught
Now everybody listen to Flav
If you don't listen to me, you'll end up in your grave
Most of these people's rhymes is whack
But I got a bunch of rhymes in my knapsack
Walk on my back with the black hat
Got the rhymes to come on the attack
Can't you tell that I'm really good lookin'
They know me from Miami, California, back to Brooklyn
Even in Spain they knew Flavor's name
In Japan they know I'm nice in the game
We maintain yo brothers feel the vibe
We did the first album and it came out fly
And don't ask why, you won't understand
Styles we got millions of fans
So come on get down like this what's up
When Flavor grab the mic, I rip your butt

What what
Let flavor rip it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what
What what
Let flavor blow it up
And if you step too close to the microphone
Your bitch ass might get caughtEmbed
