6 ContributorsTrim Lyrics
We gotta get it whenever we can
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend
Let's put the kids to sleep
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim
We gotta get it whenever we can
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend
Let's put the kids to sleep
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim

We used to be the party couple
We used to show up at the bar just to start some trouble
Now we got three more mouths to feed
And now we on the couch 'bout to fall asleep, yeah
I'll be the ground underneath your feet but I'mma need you to peel off those mommy jeans
And I don't mean for this to sound obscene
But I wanna push your panties down around your knees
Feeling like I miss you, but I'm living with you
Help me take the garbage out so I can try to kiss you
You forgot that it could get so hot inside of parked car up in the target parking lot
Put me on your calendar and dedicate a little time this month to let me tie you up
You can't imagine how much fun I'm having up in my brain
So meet me at the bathroom it's at the front of the plane

We gotta get it whenever we can
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend
Let's put the kids to sleep
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim
We gotta get it whenever we can
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend
Let's put the kids to sleep
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim

I love to watch you get ready for bed
Somebody need to give somebody some head
I didn't think you could hear what I said
And now I'm watching television Instead
I wanna make sex noises with you, wanna do it next Wednesday afternoon
I wanna chase you, catch you, and bite your lips
But I'm afraid to, don't wanna traumatize the kids (nah)
Looking over our shoulders like criminals
All because we tryna give each other stimulus
And we've enjoyed every possible position
But we probably should avoid on the counter in the kitchen (right)
Grandma play with your grandkids, let mom and dad sneak away to lay in these blankets
Lets take advantage of the circumstances
You'd think we tryna murder the mattress

We gotta get it whenever we can
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend
Let's put the kids to sleep
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim
We gotta get it whenever we can
I can't wait 'til the end of the weekend
Let's put the kids to sleep
So we can find a little free time to get me some trim
I wanna be a fool for you, I wanna splash in a pool of you
I wanna be a fool for you, I wanna splash in aâ€¦.splashEmbed
