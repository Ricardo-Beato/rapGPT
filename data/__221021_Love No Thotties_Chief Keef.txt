97 ContributorsLove No Thotties Lyrics
Hang up on me one more time and see what happens
I ain't hang up on you
Where you at though?
I'm in Chicago, Chiraq
Country?
Huh?
When are you coming out here?
When you finna come out here?
You know what I meant
Your ass drunk
What you say?
You're drunk
Why, why you act like you know me or something?
'Cause I know you, what you been drinkin'?
Why you playin' like you know me?

These bitches act local and think global
Never seen a hunnid thousand, well, let me show you one
What you want to drink? I know you hate bein' sober
And I know all these niggas hate Chief Sosa
I'm cruisin' in my 'Rari with my Louis loafers
Bitch, I'm a Rastafari, I'm a toolie toter
Wish a nigga would try to screw me over
Now I got blood on my Louis loafers
I wear thousand-dollar belts 'cause I'm a rich nigga
Nina like a boxer bitch the way she hittin' niggas
Shoes cost a bunch of shit, look at my kicks, nigga
I could've bought a ass for my bitch, nigga
I'm off this Actavis, it got me leanin' over
I poured a four of purple in some peach soda
Yo boyfriend an opp, I'll make Nina blow him
You was on the phone with him, suckin' my dick, and he ain't even know it
(Hang up on me one more time)
I ain't even try to
You wanna Glo up, baby, Keef got you
You's a gold bottle, these hoes pink Moscato
Baby, I'm the owner, you can be my castle
(Haha, why you gotta be all that?)
Baby, 'cause I like you
Only reason I text you and  why I Skype you
I just wanna fuck on you, I don't wanna wife you
But you gotta brush your teeth and do what I say do
(Hello?)
Bitch, can you hear me?
Keep your pussy in park, no 360
That boy said he gettin' guap, no, he didn't
I'm Almighty Sosa, it's complete mission
(Where you at?)
I'm nowhere around you
I'm high off this Earth I can't come back down to
Baby, this a song, I just thought I'd tell you
I would send you off but I don't wanna mail you (Be quiet)
I don't wanna smell you
'Cause I'ma cut you off quicker than I met you
I'ma swipe your name up off my schedule
And if I smoke this blunt, girl, I'm gon' forget you (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
I ain't even playin' though
I make bitches fly like Peter Pan do
(When I'ma see you?)
That's what I just asked you
You's a alcoholic, I ain't got no time for you
(Hey, can you get the water?)
Is you off the molly?
If I book your flight, is you gonna top me?
(Don't worry, I will)
Okay, you got me (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
