(Aw, yeah)
Every time I fall, you know I get up (Aw, yeah)
Try to keep me down but I get up (Aw, yeah)
Y'all say what you want but I'ma get up (Aw, yeah)
Bitch, I'ma get up (Aw, yeah)
Every time I fall, you know I get up (Aw, yeah)
Try to keep me down but I get up (Aw, yeah)
Y'all say what you want but I'ma get up (Aw, yeah)

I been down, but right now I'm way up
I been down, but right now I'm so high
I been down, but right now I'm way up
I'm too up like a layup
I walk up in Def Jam like "Fuck y'all, pay up"
This for all my homies feelin' down, y'all, stay up
Bobby finally finna take the crown, homie, wait up
Y'all ain't on my radar
I been tryna find who gon’ hold me down, no one is around
Just my homies and my family
My homies is my family
Oh my god, I can't believe I finally found a family
'Cause I ain't never had none
Family's a rarity where I come from
You might also like
(Aw, yеah)
Every time I fall, you know I get up (Aw, yеah)
Try to keep me down but I get up (Aw, yeah)
Y'all say what you want but I'ma get up (Aw, yeah)

Ayy, thinkin' about all of the things that I've seen
I'm thinkin' about the American dream
I made it from nothing, but what does that mean?
Without a family, without a team, it’s nothin'
Denials, I can't even bother to wonder
Just what my life would've been like
If I ain't had the homies right there from the jump
Would've been a fiend, would've been a drunk
But they believed in me and it perceived to be all I was doing was right
I was born in the dark, but they showed me the light
Now that's what I call homies for life
Take this advice, don't take the people around you for granted
Do not take advantage it's so hard to manage
A real relationship, yeah

(Aw, yeah)
Every time I fall, you know I get up (Aw, Yeah)
Try to keep me down but I get up (Aw, yeah)
Y'all say what you want but I'ma get up (Aw, yeah)
Bitch, I'ma get up2Embed
