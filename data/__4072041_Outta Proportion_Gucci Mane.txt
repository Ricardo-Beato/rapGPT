Hah
Cook that shit up Quay
Scooch (Evil)
Hah (Genius)
Fast coupe, haha (Nyoom)
Hah
(Mr. Nice Guy, haha)

If you ain't 'bout lettin' that choppa go, we ain't got none in common (No)
I hate snitches, I like bitches (Snitch), but I'm so in love with money (Money)
Had to cut some of my kinfolks off, they didn't keep it one hundred (What's up?)
If I said it, then I done it (Huh?), fuck that fake love, I don't want it
Time to renegotiate my contract, bitch I feel like Andre Drummond (Wow)
I'ma throw a half a mil' on Instagram lookin' like I play on Sundays
You just chick who suck my dick
Miss Lady, you're not the other woman (No)
Fuck that friendship that's platonic (No)
I need a friend that keeps me cumming (No, no)
Touch down in Boston, Gucci be flossin'
I'm about to go Stone Cold Steve Austin (Scooch)
Thieves on my trail, but you know I lost 'em (Scooch)
Four pipes, yeah I quadruple exhaust 'em
Outta this world like Marvin the Martian (Hah)
Fifty a verse and I'm underchargin'
These rappers so fake that they screamin', "Extortion"
My choppa keep blowin' shit out of proportion
Shout out these saucin', niggas are horsin'
Booties and titties, the perfect proportion
Postin' a pic and it's makin' me horny (Yeah)
Baby these carats, these are not pointers
Killin' that pussy, I'm Gucci Kevorkian
Ballin' in Fresno like Jerry Tarkanian (Yeah)
Gucci's the alien, I'm from uranium
Droppin' the top, yeah I'm crackin' the cranium (Drop)
Out in the stadium (Top) like I play (Guwop), all my kinfolks call me Ray (Ray)
Then my grandad look at me, like, "I'm so damn glad you lit"
Why's your jewelry lookin' aluminum?
Why's it dull? What did you do to them?
I'm gettin' full, pockets on stuffed (Ooh)
Dressin' like a plug, yeah I stay jerked up (Scooch)
Knocked me down, picked 'em up
Salt me down, yeah fuck me up (Yeah fuck me up)
Too turnt up, too turnt up
Knocked me down, but I picked them up (Whoa)
Salt me down, salt me down
Yeah they salt me down, but I turnt them up (No)
But I'm too turnt up (Too), I'm so up (Up, up, up, up)
Wop
