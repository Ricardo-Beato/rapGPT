What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך
What are you afraid of? (Uh)
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
One-two, one-two, uh
Tell me your fears
Sometimes I see the... Is everything okay?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך, uh
Tell me your fears

Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is
I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows, though
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe, though
Now I'm dressin' so expensive for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got some fam who can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go
Spent a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free
Remember love if you can't remember me
You might also like
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right

It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on
I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this
Still, plantin' seeds so my money long
Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon' itch
I wish we could just all get rich
Sometimes not havin' money is all I miss
And, yeah, these hoes are all up on my dick
The all American girl, that's just a blonde hair bitch
Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?
Could we figure out what God might've miss?
It's funny that these questions never get an answer
Life a bitch sometimes, you gotta reprimand her
Never understand her, why should I even try?
Live forever then you'll never feel the need to die
This a letter, open it to set you free
Remember love and remember me
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right

What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
And how you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam watchin' Paid in Full, I
Never had good grades in school, but
Shock the world is what I came to do, I
Got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me? I said
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
How you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam watchin' Paid in Full, I
Never had good grades in school, but
Shock the world is what I came to do, I
Got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me?8Embed
