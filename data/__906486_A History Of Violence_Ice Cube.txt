7 ContributorsA History Of Violence Lyrics
Blacks who ventured across the unmarked border were often attacked
By teenage members of the new gang called The Spook Hunters
One of a handful of white gangs active in this time
It was only natural for L.A.'s newest residents to respond unkind

As white attacks started to increase in the mid 1940's and late 1940's
Blacks started to organize their clubs really as a defensive mechanism
And the boss men or the business men and the Snyder boys and all these
Clubs in south L.A. really were just sorta defending themselves against
White violence that was coming from Huntington Park and Southgate

The demise of the black panthers in Los Angeles is said to be another
Blow to a generation of black teenagers that witnessed many of its role models
Assasinated throughout the 1960's
 spoken
What I'm sayin in so many words, they shoulda let the panthers
Went on because there probably would never have been no crips and no bloodsYou might also likeEmbed
