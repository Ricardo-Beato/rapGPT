38 ContributorsOut Late Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's Lil Boat
I need a hunnid for a show (I need a hunnid for a show)

'Cause with you, I like to stay out late
All night and all day
Just me and you
Yeah, you my favorite boo
'Cause with you, I like to stay out late
All night and all day
Just me and you
Yeah, you my favorite boo
Girl, with you, I like to stay out late
All night and all day
Just me and you
Girl, you my favorite boo

I bring you around everywhere and you know that
All these other bitches broke and you know that
Bitches ain't got nothing on you
You say Lil Boat's your favorite dude
Together we could make the news
These bitches broke, they don't even have a clue
That's why I'm rocking with you
That's why you rocking with me
Baby, it's plain to see
You and me, we are just meant to be, whoa
When you riding in the whip with me
I feel so safe, I feel so goddamn complete
You might also like
'Cause with you, I like to stay out late
All night and all day
Just me and you
Yeah, you my favorite boo
'Cause with you, I like to stay out late
All night and all day
Just me and you
Yeah, you my favorite boo
Girl, with you, I like to stay out late
All night and all day
Just me and you
Girl, you my favorite boo2Embed
