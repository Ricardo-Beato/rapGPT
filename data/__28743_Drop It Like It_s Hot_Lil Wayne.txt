You know me girl
I'm a Cash Money millionaire, look at my Rollie girl
Drop to your knees, tie up your hair, ah-ah, slow me girl
Now hit it strong, won't be long, now catch it slowly girl
"No he didn't say that," yes I did girl
I don't use rubbers and I don't plan no kids girl
I don't want your number, I want your draws and ya skins girl
Then after that, you can get it how you live girl
That's on the real girl, I'm a pimp girl (What)
Get it twisted, I'll slam you like Shawn Kemp girl (What)
I'm the one to get it hot like a lighter girl (Sss)
I'll just slap you a couple of times, never fight it girl
That's cause I likes it girl
And let me tell you somethin girl (What) I am a player girl (What)
So don't you try to play me cause I never save a girl (What)
Do me a favor girl (What) and wet the spot girl (What)
And after you back it up, drop it like it's hot girl

Go up in flames, block burner, that's my motto boy
It ain't a game, I cock that, put somethin' inside a boy

Catch her at the house steppin out the shower boy (Shh, hehehe)
Got a lot of boys, claim to be soldiers but lies boy
And if I catch 'em, I'ma bat 'em and make 'em retire boy
Put a hump in your back (What) and bend your rump (What)
Hey sexy little mama (What) we can do the hump (What)
And you can hurt me, hurt me (What) sex me, sex me

Got this thang up in ya like a snake in the grass (Sss)
I know you wish you could go home (Go home)
To a nigga with a dick like a python (Python)
Stay up in ya like a off the hook telephone (Telephone)
Got ya walkin round with nothin but a fuckin thong (What)
Take the switches on these bitches cause I'm so wrong
So wrong, so wrong, so wrong
