46 ContributorsGangland Lyrics
Future Hendrix
Yeah
It ain't a secret
Straight up

I'm the one that got the presi' flooded
You wear more Chanel than anybody
You the type to get your man indicted
I'm the type to pull up in a Spider
I'm the type to drive a Honda
Put a hundred round clip inside a dirty rifle
It's dirty when it got a homi' on it
Fuck that nigga, put a bounty on him
I'm the one that put that dirty in the cup
Had you sippin', noddin' off, nigga
You was gettin' fronted, runnin' off, nigga
I made myself to a boss, nigga
Put a hundred carats in a cross, nigga
Spent two hundred thousand on a cross, nigga
Can't never sleep 'cause it'll cost niggas
They can never see my palms sweatin'
You'd've never seen the hunger in me
I'm so sick and tired of being humble, nigga
This money put a lot of demons in me
Went and tatted all these angels on me
Fuck that nigga, put a tracker on him
Then we throw a pep rally on him
These commas coming in, these haters coming in
The karma coming back from when I was gettin' it in
Baby mama tryna sue again
Bought my little ones Christian Louboutins
Give my nigga commissary in the pen'
Got the federales on a nigga chin
Fuck the Benz, I'ma whip the Spur
Said fuck my Spur and bought my bitch a Ghost
I'm full of syrup and I'm seeing ghosts
I'm pushing heir' like the N.O.
You might also like
You know we got that boy-boy like New Orleans, you hear me?
We runnin' that pack through Chi-Town, Memphis
All up through B-More and DC
Back down South, you hear me?

Lil Mexico turf a gangland (Woo)
I'm ABK like I'm Zona Man (Zona)
That's Any Body Killa, nigga (Nigga)
Do you got the heart to kill a nigga? (Splatt)
A hundred thousand for a lawyer (A lawyer)
It gotta be a Johnnie Cochran (A Cochran)
We take the dope from off the border (The border)
From the water, put it in some water (Then whip it)

Know some Mexicanos down in Georgia (My migos)
We on every channel when we poppin'
Hit him in the head and start braggin' 'bout it
They on 7th Street, they got a bunch of bodies
Got a bunch of chains, my neck is very crowded
When I flood the streets, they have a powder shower
Know the recipe, you need to learn about it
Finessin' niggas, gotta learn about it
I could cook it in the microwave
I got your baby mama with the shits
I got your son sitting on a brick
My teacher said I wouldn't be shit (Fuck her)
She even know what I represent
Freeband Gang president
Money over everything, nigga
And everything else irrelevant
Yeah
Woo
Woo
Skrrt
Brrat

Lil Mexico turf a gangland (Yeah)
I'm ABK like I'm Zona Man (Woo)
That's Any Body Killa, nigga (Woo)
Do you got the heart to kill a nigga? (Skrrt)
A hundred thousand for a lawyer (Fuck 'em)
It gotta be a Johnnie Cochran (Brrat)
We take the dope from off the border (A hundred ounce)
From the water, put it in some water (Brrat)18Embed
