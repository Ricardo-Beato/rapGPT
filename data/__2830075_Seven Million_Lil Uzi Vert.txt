You see I'm drippin' in baguettes, hey
You see I'm drippin' VVS, hey
You see me drippin' doin' the flex, hey
(T-T-T-T-Trenchwerk)

You see me flexin' on your bitch, don't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' on your bitch, you can't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' VVS, hey
You see I'm flexin' on your bitch, hey
You see I'm flexin' VVSs, don't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' VVS, they can't forget about me
You know I'm flexin' on a bitch, hey
You know I'm flexin' on your clique
Say

Girl, you're cool but you know, I could find a better you
Feelings ain't changed but you might need somethin' new
Yeah, might need a better dude
Louis Vuitton, the Gabbana, Prada, the better shoes (Better shoes)

Put my pedal to the floor (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah)
Uh, yeah, make it roar (Roar, what?)
Pull up, skrrt, 'Ventador (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Jump out, uh, lift my door (Yeah)
You might also like
And that bitch kinda hard to handle (Yeah)
Chop it, flip it, move it out the bando (Chop it, chop it)
Pull up in a Bentley, foreign cars are random (Yeah)
Matter of fact, I probably want the Phantom, yeah

You see me flexin' on your bitch, don't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' on your bitch, you can't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' VVS, hey
You see I'm flexin' on your bitch, hey
You see I'm flexin' VVSs, don't forget about me

You know I'm flexin' on a bitch, hey
You know I'm flexin' on your clique

Put my pedal to the floor (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah)
Uh, yeah, make it roar (Roar, what?)
Pull up, skrrt, 'Ventador (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Jump out, uh, lift my door

Know I'm flexin' on your clique
Blink of a eye, know that I would take your bitch (Take your bitch)
I cannot lie, I cannot live life like this
'Cause if I lie then I know it is not real, yeah
You can't forget (No)
Baby, please, don't forget about me (Ayy)
Yeah, she saw my Rollie won't forget about me (Forget about me)
Addicted to my flexin', now can't live without me (Live without me)
