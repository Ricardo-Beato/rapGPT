36 ContributorsLord Forgive Me Lyrics
(Fuck 12)

A hundred a zip and I'm sippin' on drop
I hit for a hunnid and I bought me a drop
I pulled up on her and panties just drop
Up 32 shots and you niggas gon' drop
Off with your top (Head), give a fuck 'bout your block 1-2
High speed chasing, give a fuck 'bout the cops
When I see 12, put the dope in my sock
Niggas be rappin', I came up off rocks
I'm thuggin', Im thuggin', I feel like I'm 'Pac
They tried to betray me
I'm mad at myself 'cause I keep it real with all these niggas
Niggas actin' like bitches, niggas all in they feelings
These niggas acting like women
Drowning in money, I'm swimmin'
These bitches acting like pigeons
I just want a couple million, I just want a couple million
And I'm still loyal to the gang
These other niggas, man, they lame
I really sold cocaine, Gas stank propane
Glock .40, nigga bang, Blood, Crip, nigga, bang
I heard you got your chain took and had to get another damn chain
21, nigga, the gang, slaughter your daughter, the gang
MAC 90 got range, young savage got aim
I bought a new Rollie, it's plain, you niggas best stay in your lane
I pull up and fuck on your main
I'm covered in money, I'm drippin'
These niggas they telling, they snitchin'
So we gon' fuck on all they bitches, I be 'round lot of henchmen
Moving like I'm John Gotti, 12 gauge, nigga, shotty
Hit 'em all in the body, I just caught another body
Lord, forgive me, I'm sorry, I can't help it, I'm a street nigga
I had to get some money, I watched my momma struggle
I jumped off the porch, had to use my muscle

Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith
I just nutted on her face
Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case

Lord, forgive me for my sins, I was struggling, tryna win
I had to lose a lot of friends, nigga, tryna chase them Ms
Cooking up crack, it's illegal, riding with a Desert Eagle
I'm a felon, that's illegal, main bitch, she illegal
Hunnid pounds of Cali' reefer, Call of Duty heat seeker
Pull up on your in a Regal, window down, nigga, creeping
Nigga rapping? I'm preachin', nigga, we are not equal
In the trenches, niggas beefing, I remember not sleeping
Hit the club and get to squeezing, shoot it up for no reason
I was living like a demon, I was living like a demon

Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me, Lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me, lord
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith
I just nutted on her face
Brand new Rollie with the face
No face, no case5Embed
