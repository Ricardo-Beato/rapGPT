20 ContributorsFucked Over Lyrics
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over

I ain't got time for no diva
Especially when it came from Pleasers
I've got too much ahead of me
Give a fuck about a bitch, I got the recipe
I'm on my way, and ain't no one gettin' in my way
I'm doin' too much, I've done too much

You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You might also like
I know you feel salty
You wish you could be over me
You see how I lie, see how I lie, woah
'Cause your new nigga, he broke
Suddenly, I don't have to say it, you just know
It's too easy to see, I know you wish you could be with me
But no, because

You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
So fuck you, you fucked me over

Fuck you, you fucked me over
Fuck you, you fucked me over
Know you wish you were with me
Fuck you, you fucked me over4Embed
