4 ContributorsWord Is Born Lyrics
Let's begin, to talk!!

1990, and this is what's going on
To the break of dawn
24/7, Run-D.M.C. in effect
Fast-forwarding
All those weak-rhyming, rewinding MC's
	That need to pause
	My word is born

Yeah, speaking on truth
From the old school on down to the youth
Since the days, that I was the age of
"Three"; stop - listen to me
This is how it used to be - Go!
Stand on the ? line, why?
You did a crime now the time is mine
To school you and your crew, why?
Using my brother
Stop - selling and killing one another
Take some time, to see what's missin'
Brothers in the ? like you, we on a mission
Thinking back from the sale you made
And back home, a grave is what your brother paid
His life, 'cause of a system
Now you think you're down, you cold dissed him
Shut up, cause I'm fed up, with this culture
I'm flying high in the sky, a big vulture
Waiting and debating, to see who's next
For "brothers and sisters" of the opposite sex
So hold on, keep it intact
And go on, flow on, positive black
B-boys be black be proud, right on
"Come on! You know I'm proud to" be black
And my word is born
My word is born
My word is born
My word is born
You might also like
Let's, let's..
Let's begin to talk truth -- it seems
That y'all make a bang out of things that are small
We all play the same game for fame to claim
?? bright lights and write your name
They'll soup you up, til you think you're large
Got a spot on tour, but I'm still in charge
A big gig, a shindig, don't renege
Bust a rap like a cap like a snap of twig
That extends from the hands of a branch on a tree
Like you new jack rappers, run from me
I got proof of truth, I cut and go raw
(Word em up D.!)  My word is born
{*cuts by Jay and samples to the last ten seconds*}

1990's
And ain't nothing changed, punk!Embed
