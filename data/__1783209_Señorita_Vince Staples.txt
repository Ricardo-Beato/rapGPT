125 ContributorsSeñorita Lyrics

Hey, hey

Ayy, 9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she better not get—
9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she keep me, she-

Fuck your dead homies, run your bread, homie
Got some lead for me, I'm on Artesia
Parked in my Bimmer, bumping my own shit
I'm focused, they stuck on that old shit
Living for that True Religion is broke shit
I could spend that on a MAC with a long clip
Fly in that Benz, but you hide in that Focus
My nigga, just focus, I'm trying to paint you a picture
We stuck in the moment
My burner get stuck if I shoot it too much
So a nigga resorted to doming
That's somebody's son, but a war to be won
Baby, either go hunt or be hunted
We crabs in a bucket
He called me a crab, so I shot him in front of the Douglas
I cannot be fucked with, we thuggin' in public

My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she better not get—
9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she keep me, she-

What mean the world to you?
Is it fast life, money, and clothes?
Probably fucking these hoes?
Or what would you murder for?
Will your name hold weight when the curtains close?
Nigga caught one case, and I heard he told
Snitch get a full clip and closed casket
Won't hug your bitch when the ho ratchet
Cold jumper, been shooting, no practice
Been touring, whip foreign, coupe crashing
Still banging 2 Naughty 2 Nasty
Still "fuck the police," they won't catch me
My feature too pricey, don't ask me
Go hard 'til Goyard on my baggage
He mad, we won't fight, I'm gon' tag him
Mask up at midnight and start clapping
Kids crying, still snipe him, no lacking
Ayy, 9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she better not get—
9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she keep me, she—
9 millimeter, my brother's my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she better not get—
9 millimeter, my brothers my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me, she keep me, she—
