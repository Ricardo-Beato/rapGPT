This another one from your boy V-O
I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down
This another one from your boy V-O
I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, all this Love (Loving me)
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, all this Love (Loving me)

Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day
And I want to know, if You Feel The Same Way
Because I'm in and out of town, that's just how I got's to get down
But you understand, that's why I'm your man

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (Loving me)
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (Loving me)

Uh, uh, uh (Uh, V-O)
Uh, uh, uh (Yeah man)
Yeah, yeah (Haha, it's just me and you girl)
Yeah, yeah (Keep rocking to this beat)
Uh, uh, uh (You want me to drop to this beat?)
Uh, uh, uh (Ho!)
Yeah, yeah (Let me get a little gospel on them, yeah, Uh)

They say he wanted the bounce back
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game, ah
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (Loving me)
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (Loving me)

Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (Loving me)
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (Loving me)5Embed
