6 ContributorsMy Time (Outro) Lyrics
I do it on my time, you gone have to wait for me
I do not Roc crew (?) from me
Tasers on my feet, them bitches got rabies
I do (?) blow (?)
Get in, get gone, get in, get gone
Get in, get gone, get in, get gone
I do it on my time, you gone have to wait for me
I do not Roc crew (?) from me

In the pants full of bands, Polo v-neck
Swimmin' in the money so long, I think I'm seasick
And my crew victorious, no secrets
And I bet that I'll pass like the teacher's pet
But if I don't pass like the teacher's wreck
It goes down like I'm in Yung Joc's town
And I hear them lil niggas tryna steal Thug's sound
But I'm still the best, do it, pass my crown

Yeah, and I've been the best for four years, like Obama
And you know process is greater than a promise, bitch
Well come here Franklin, let me talk to ya
Listen, no homo though
You might also like
But you know I love you baby
You know I love you baby
You know I love you baby
I love you baby, I love you baby

Don't talk it personal, I never heard of you
You say he servin' you, he say he skirted you
He say he seen you wear that New York Knicks jersey blue
He say you wanted 50 but layin' with you was a copy too
What up (?) you
There ain't no stoppin' you
You turnt nobody in, yet they might be droppin' you
Tryna turn in one my members and they might be moppin' you
You know I'm blood bitch, I don't be with that rockin' blue

Yeah, and I've been the best for four years, like Obama
And you know process is greater than a promise, bitch
Well come here Franklin, let me talk to ya
Listen, no homo though

I do it on my time, you gone have to wait for me
I do not (?) from me
Tasers on my feet, them bitches got rabies
I do (?) blow (?)
Get in, get gone, get in, get gone
Get in, get gone, get in, get gone
I do it on my time, you gone have to wait for me
I do not (?) from me
But you know I love you baby
You know I love you baby
You know I love you baby
I love you baby, I love you baby

Rock the beat, rock the beat
Rock free, rocker free
Chef Boyardee, Chef Boyardee
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Haaaa, OG
Got my OG in the buildin'
We roll lackin'
We no longer mackin', we (?)
Ohhhh

But you know I love you baby
You know I love you baby
You know I love you baby
I love you baby, I love you baby1Embed
