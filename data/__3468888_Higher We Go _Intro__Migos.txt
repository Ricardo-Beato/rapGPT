Higher we go, beg and plead for the culture
Higher we go, beg and plead for the culâ€”

I'ma put these racks in your face
In your face, show you that you lame
I'ma stash these Ms at my place
In my place, but no I'm not the bank
I'ma pull that coupe out to race
Who wanna race? We livin' that fast pace
I'ma pull these hoes, I don't chase
Hit these hoes, get 'em right out my face
I'ma pull the strap close case
Hit a nigga hard, send him dat way
I'ma put the gang on your plate (Gimme the plate, ayy)
You can't eat on my plate (No eatin')
Mount it up like the horse on Raris (Yeah, skrrt, ayy)
Beat that pot like Ortiz, yeah (Beat it)
Two feet runnin' from the feds (Yeah, 12)
All these niggas lookin' like they scared (Yeah, pussy)
Lock a fuck nigga like these dreads (Yeah, pop 'em)
Pick a nigga off for that bread (Yeah, hey)

Big boy Wraith had them bitches seein' stars stars (Wraith)
Stock me out, I don't need no rims on cars (Hey, hey)
It's okay (Okay)
Icing, Icing glaze (Icin' glaze)
I don't take breaks
Shit, I'm 'bout to go blaze? ('Bout to go blaze)

Flooded my wrist, it's soakin' (Flooded)
Split up the waters like Moses (Split)

No drip, don't trip, my gang with me (Don't trip)
