Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere

In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh

It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright

Oh
Oh, oh

What a world that I'm livin' in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
(Still I feel my) Path narrow, I run again
Seem happiness is gone again
(And then you see 'em) Grey clouds up above, mane
Metaphoric to my life, mane
(Still I feel my) Heart stronger than it's ever been
Strong will 'til my journey ends
(Until then I roll) More than I ever rolled
Not pills, but the Mary though
(Still I feel my) Eyes heavy when the day goes
Nothin' helpin' when my head doze
(But I ain't 'sleep) Awake in another state
Livin' in a new space
(Still I feel my) Mind runnin' at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race (Until then I go)

(Ahh) The sky might fall

Somethin' special I am runnin' to
(Until then I go) Away, very far away
To another universe where all the people say
It's the new-new place for the special to embrace
Like a Martian who seemingly wandered out of place
Take what you need from the valley of the hope, where
Even if you drown you'll be floatin' higher up, and
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high

And nobody wanted to believe me

Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said, "Tonight I feel immortal," ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, woah

So many times I've broke this vicious cycle

I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

Stings bitch, bzzzz...
BzzzzZZZzzz

I pass any test of litmus, I workout at 24 Fitness
On the weekends I sip Belvedere with that citrus
My dogs is vicious, exotic nympho whore for the mistress
Life is good, I live every day like it's Christmas
Happy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here
I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird 'til she sings out
La la la la, Bobby could convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala
Plus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas
Like Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla
Gold rings like the Green Lantern you see me in the mean phantom
Pushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton
Or maybe in the grotty, rugged projects of Staten
Tall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks

If my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in '92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas gon' eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet

Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they never change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin' got them sucka niggas hatin'
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' 'bout crack or we talkin' about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin' the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin', they fittin' to run up
Then they gettin' the come up, yup, bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas

I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad, my nigga

Element of the surprise
Such a spectacular thing I cannot, lie
So many things people wanna limit you to be
I show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The negative that come out they mouth, so sad
When I smash, wipe the smirk off they face, my bad
Who bad? I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
At eleven I had to throw on the pants
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats, solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on, who gon' go half on a zone?
Oh, thought I would be done off that coke, no
Let me tell you some' ho
Ben said "Everything that shine ain't gold"
Been skeetin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been the nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really 'cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished, no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be ok, with being demented
By the way nigga, these cars ain't rented, I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted, look who the fuck it be
That skinny Cleveland niggie, I stay reppin' my city bitch
Been smokin', no jokin', Cudder's had that itch, so I scratch

Lord of the Sad and Lonely
Yeah

Won't you tell me who is; the supreme leader
Still underused, like I'm not a human heater
Move and groove, make a bitch linger
Want more than the dick, gold on the ring finger
Not the one to play dumb, see I'm from Cleveland bitch
Up in the hills, still keep it way triller than most
Wanna relax, someone tell me how that feels
I say that now until I go and pop this pill
I say out loud "You wanna let me cop a feel?"
Now I don't pray out loud but I know that my God heals
Bounce with me, if you don't give a fuck simply
Fed up, won't let up, on the overtime
The more I work, the more they wanna sweat mine
I can feel those lames, they love to speak my name
Sometimes dream of breakin' niggas whole faces
In front of the precinct, ain't scared of catchin' cases
Sky might fall, but I ain't worried at all
Got me some Xannies and a couple Adderall
Plus these racks I go distribute at the mall
In the spirit of God, with some Gandalf balls, yahm
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
And the ones that feel like shit on the daily
Don't let these phony niggas and hoes
Be the ones that bring you low
Let it be from the fatigue from making the pussy bleed
All of the things I've seen and survived
Make a nigga feel way more than just alive
You know my name, you know my face

Checkin' my fresh, if you want, I can style you
So unearthly, my profession is to wow you
Nigga how you not better than me? Listen, I swear to Je'
I feel like Baby back in '99
In the SLS stuntin' and it's all mine
Shittin' on these niggas, sippin' on some Swiss Kriss
I got some jewelry on it, sittin' on my slit wrists
My label fucking up my flow, see I'm getting pissed
Work too damn hard fam, for the shenanigans
Don't hang around bums, and that's how I win, fe fi fo fum
Haters, how do my cum taste? No more fun, no jokes, no smiles
Just a grin that suggest I'm the best
Living like I got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times
So many kids live their life through my rhymes
See, I'm in love with you all 'til the end
When shit was dark for me you were my only friends on the realer
So smoke some tree for your nigga
Ain't nobody got my bounce, know my kushy ounce

Think it's time I open my mind where I left these niggas incompletely
Make sure that they can't delete me
I'm bout to rewire your whole fucking mainframe, sick of the same
Lame old same thing
I got some bubonic you might wanna mix with some whisk
I got a vendetta with showing niggas that I'm way better
Feeling way worthless, the lost black sheep of G.O.O.D. Music
Only good for a hook, huh? Let me show you flows
Intuitive when it comes to the many things I know
Cold, most winters I would dream of being a winner
Feeling like less than shit to the doubters
Pain I promise to all who oppose my knowledge
My reign, the fucking essence of pain, fuck rain
Standing in a monsoon of cool, time will tell
This is what it is when you're walking to hell

I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human

God, I thought I loved you so
God, I thought I loved you so

They done let in the skinny jean-wearing
Fro-for-days in a old AA
Ball' so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don’t sleep
Figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think

Oh, oh-oh, oh
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Oh, oh-oh, oh

I live through words, not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, past the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
Lotta of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Some things will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga

What up, how is everyone doing?
You are now in a world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some "generation next" shit
Speak for the silent who are left with
Parallel levels in a dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club
Money doesn't move me except on the literal
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words, these are facts from a winner

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy

Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, faded aided to the T
Work hard, making sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh

My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable
Snowman, old man, when you trying to shine like gold
When it's my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was hit with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And Pachanga so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I've tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, it's better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way that I watch a stranger

Chillin', rolling up something to change my feelin'
Thinkin' about how I came up from nothing while I’m splittin'
This cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran in your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight, but cool enough for me to hit the scene
Not knowing this was all a set up, secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive, kept pressing on
Nine gripped, thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door, they shot, I shot, someone dropped shit
The nigga with something to lose just almost lost it
Won't trust him again
Do it again, I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again, do it again

Cheese came through at 3
Salute, at ease, C had supplied the weed
Cause IBN had OD'd
It's me with a black rockstar steeze
Real rock tees, 300 a pop for these
Please, bummy? You don’t know me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heine with my Jamie-boo beside me
That's my fucking best friend
When I'm tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off, I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught, I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me

Who whipped Supremes, the candy-painted eyes
But the love from the boppers had 'him watchin they rise
Wasn't no love for a nigga in the smug
Sipping out a cup, a concoction for cruising
High off life? My nigga, not even
I'ma go to war with the Devil 'til we're even

And we're right here on a beautiful morning
In Cleveland, Ohio, and it's chilly today
The kids are going to school, the grass is frosty
(This should be my) Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out
(Theme song) In the morning
(To life) Hello Cleveland
(Hahah) Yeah

A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
"Wonder what them folks on?" That's what they be askin'
Dumb kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga passin'
We gettin' to the cash and, you can see a nigga shinin'
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple, two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find him
'Less he out on the road ('Less he out on the road)
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just, pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
And free my scalp, I need to free my mind a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Don't really like sippin' cause I get to trippin'
My nigga, just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a little bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by 5-0

Probably cause of all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss
What a nigga tryna get you thinking 'bout

Puff-puff-pass with your bitch-ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict, tragic, stay rolling up while reclining

Good look, Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right

And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom, how a teach had a son
That never gave a fuck about a scantron?
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid, guaranteed fan
Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young, and my, my mom's calling
Think I should hit decline

Wearing a kilt? He must be gay"

But some girls tweet how they miss my meat
Yeah, Cudders; HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow
Don't take no shit, you can blame my ma
I'm in the maze, I'm in a daze, I'm losing it

In-in the room, boy on the moon
(Had-had no-no one) No one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my little homies
One year younger, they ain't get where I was going
Took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely (Hmm)
Lonely in my room
I-I mean me, up on the moon
Entertained myself, laughed at myself
As I grew to be a teen, I disguised myself
Had the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls
Tried every sport just to impress all the girls
Instead of all the ladies, 'cause they talked down
I was too artsy, known to be a clown (Hmm)
(Ah-huh) And now my Facebook poppin'
'Cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit
One day

This will be my world

Yeah, yeah, uh, big homie, made the move
Made-made the move, flew off the moon
Still (Had no-no one) no one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas
All I would wonder is when will my time come
Had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them
Thinkin' 'bout my bosses, yep I hated all of them
Studio at night had me hustlin' to most of them
Nigga, I was late damn near every day
But I'ma be on time when my stars align
When my soul was happy on my Ramen diet
Followed by a loosey, was the meal of grinders
If you knowin' the truth, all you think about is that thing
Always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
Until you meet a kid like K-I
Niggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high
We getting money, mom

See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and man
I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah
The beginning is always followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around

Things do come around
But some things trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing

You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend

Silent Fire
Silent fire burning in the far
the corners of my soul I don't roam
"Will heaven be brighter?"
Silent fire
"Hold on much tighter"
Silent fire
A woman with fire in her eyes
Lays by the flowers
Welcoming what underneath lays
Silent fire
He goes with her
The path of crystals and shimmering rays
Welcoming me whole in all my ways
A Silent fire

Jus for a little nano second to holla at her quick

Yup

Shades over my eyes
Make the creepers look back at themselves
Sittin' stuck, in emotional bliss
The skinny model girls rub coke on their gums
Tap my knee, I'm keepin' the rhythm
The young and wild take chances together
They all jump up, twist and groove
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood

No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

There's a hunger in the night
The moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame
I kissed her inner thigh
Closed my eyes, she began to make me fish
She like to go the mile
All the while I could see her tear a bit
I forgot her name, somethin that sound like Penelope
Maybe a French twang to it
Her tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
A lovely foreigner, foreign to racism
She like that young nigga vibe
My brown skin, my shagged out 'fro
I'm king to her, and she will please her friend for me
So funny how the starvin' are guardless
Naked is always honest
Her hands all over my privates, lost in the mood

Which in turn made my day

Lord help me out
Save my soul, need to find a new route
I don't even hear what other niggas talking 'bout
Call me a hipster as long as you're a listener
Label me what you like
I'm close to my victory, dozed in the fight
When I open my eyes somehow seeing night
Beyond tryna see what being rich feel like
Six-figure checks for my mom for peace
Everybody wanna stick on me like leech
Take my blood, give fake love
'Til I turned them down, now I'm the one who changed, bruh?
Ask why I don't call
'Cause when I was starving, you wasn't at all
Around, now I gotta shut shit down
Be a man, pick friends, all selective now
You're cool, you're cool, fuck you
And to the bitch that—oh yeah, fuck you too
Tried to shine, now everyone knows
Yeah, Kid Cudi slipped up and loved them hoes
We all make mistakes, yes
No worries, I just kill a bitch with success
While she at home stressed out eating ice cream
I'm at the Grammys living out a nice dream
No bitch on arm
Just my words and my stoner charm
And my dimples deep, I smile at peace
'Cause I went out and got what most y'all seek
Now I'm the one you meet
Who throws you the peace sign, missed not one step
And this is just the first step

Four in the morning, gettin' cozy

Tuesday weekly, the Legend of the Rager
Most have witnessed the Cud in the club
We don't have Plain Pat ready
Ice is thrown and the whole crew gone
Done off for better and very celebratory
Fuck the blogs, I'ma tell my story
No matter the phase, my name is engraved
In the minds of the youngins who be livin' to they graves
You live and you learn
Doing bumps in the day and keep blunts to burn

Rage, 'cause I'm paid
Take the grey, and create another shade
Awesome, no more bitches playin' possum
Pop and lock 'em and send 'em on home
Tired of hoes, all they want is to get chose
Know the code, want a woman with some toes
Optimos, takin' trips to Australia
Do some blow and hope you make it through the show
Hands, high
Go with your soul and try floatin' through the sky
Hide the pain with some pussy and Mimosas

I put black spray paint on my windows during the day
I want to spend time with it, I think I'm losing it
Or I found it and I'm using it
I wear my shades at night so I can look in the abyss
I see something in nothingness if you can picture this
Put black holes in my jar lid, I climb the wall
I'm too high now, I'll die from the fall

Transitionin' to my inner, I'm hearin' their voice
Tellin' me stay in focus, keep focusin', boy
Feelin' like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city

Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen', dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche

Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call

Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of the Chosen

Distancing myself while I'm focusing, fo-focusing
Don't pretend to worry bout shit
Go through one ear and out the other
Better off saying nothing, nigga

Stop judging a nigga because they're different

Having guillotine dreams with my enemies, oh
See 'em in the ditch, see 'em out, hit the exit
Can't stand to hear a bitch nigga mouth
I took a hook in the road to get in the mode, geronimo
Get in my jeans, white tee, and clean fitted
Hoes know me 'round the map, I can't hide the old summers
Hit the fuse and I lit it, the rest unfolds
Tell me how the fuck does he does it?
Levels unreachable, can't pin him to a mold
It's like a nigga been here before
Shit is a bore, my thoughts soar in the AM
Slay them like a machine round the clock
With the 12 gauge aim, telling Satan to fuck off
Hated the hand I was given
Tossed that shit back, like God must be kidding
And not for a nigga like me, not for the family
Not with a similar plans I just dumped
And I made me some choices, heard voices follow
No, can't stop a man with passion
These hoes don't distract a god, I am no clown
Grown man laying the stones all around in my throne
My kingdom, throwing from space
Fuck off expression on face, this is the case
I'm in place to be great, hmm
No fakes, raising the stakes

And if I piss people off along the way, bonus

No more dodging this shit, the cat and mouse
Finding love in the shadows, ready to pounce
They yearning for my return
Laying next to him, you daydreaming of my meat
You remember when I said, "Put it on my face"?
Damn, girl, when will you learn? There's no escaping me
Passion never dissipates, no soul without your mate, relate
Man, I could've never fathomed
Hate you mingling with these corny niggas, though I don't care how it happened

Sloppiest sex, the best way, we're both giving dome
Uh-uh, until the break of dawn

Can't duck my energy, ever

Stop searching, chasing your tail

Remember we once saved each other from hell?

Flaws and all, somebody would love to have me, too
But you can tell I'm bored with these hoes
Sex is weak when there isn't a glow
Takes a man longer to see this fact
Women are quicker with this type of shit, we know
Uh, uh, show me the lane, dude

Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone
Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon

Have you ever been to heaven at night? Night
Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night

Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Closing your eyes, the feeling so right
At first you might see just one bright beam of light
Clutching your soul to the toll of the bright
Happy unites and feelings take flight
Blind to the evils, you give them no sight
Focus on floatin', your focus is tight
Like you rewrote an essay for a class, to pass in the night
Have you ever seen an ending so nice?
You feel so free, like you're high as a kite
Like how you feel if you drink some Bud Light, followed by Jag
Models who smile, then tilt their head back
These are a few of the visions I like
Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
This is my heaven at night

Have you
Ever been to heaven at night?

Focus baby don't look at me
See right through me, understand my heartbeat
Murmurs to mock your rhythm
Yeah, my nuts, the other girls want 'em
But they can't have, at least for the moment, I'm with you
There could be people around, I'm just focused on you
You can sip Chardonnay and I'ma have myself a brew
I'm a country ass nigga baby, you know how I roll
Your face, never seen something more perfect
You dance in my mind like Justice
I know you listening back like, "Damn, bro!"
Laid back so gentle like the violins
Lay on the beat and we don't have to be as discreet
Can I have a taste? "Absolutely!"
You're my sweet tangerine, let's make a smoothie
But baby, all jokes aside
My heart beats faster when you open your thighs
I'm just ready to slide, ride and glide
Whenever, baby, whenever, baby
Whenever, baby, however

Whenever, however, you want me, girl
You got me (Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me, boo
It's me and you, babe, me and you

As he transforms to a whole 'nother being
Super duper
Nice

I am the one that you might see around town
Giving up daps and pounds
So high up but I'm holdin' it down
Screamin' what up? What it be?

Step up in the place just me and my buddy
Everywhere I go they screamin Kid Cudi!
Launching away from the helipad
Running out of bud, re-up before I'm hella mad
Hella like my dad in the sense of my ignorance
Now I give a shit bout less more than a little bit
One hell of a kid, and I kick it
Lord willing pure feelin' to the tenth power
Mash on the pedal, float above gravel
Weave through the city streets
Seize what the people seek
Please come follow a dude haters in the media call rude
How do you conclude to intro the interlude?
The game runs dry, bringin' the lube
Skinny as a fuck, still eatin' the food
Hard to kill Cudder like Steven Segal yeah
Haters applaud and they are appalled cause I see y'all
Can't hide in your closet, stop it
Be a boogie man, go do nothing beautiful
Sorry, I'm an honest man, fuck it
To my enemies: please squash it
You don't want Cudder to transform to a maniac
Kinda like Pat after plenty gin and tonic
Say I'm not a lyricist you fuckers need to figure out the logic
When I'm in rap mode it's nothing less than brolic
Don't run on beats motherfucker, I frolic

Hawaiian super kush for everyone

Let us get it in and get out
Exhale, inhale, eyes on the road seen foes
They linger ahead
Not really there, really here
Nor here, nor there, not really scared
But oh well, I'll still be where what they might see as the wrong path
Embrace bad with the good, keep doing the math
Trying to get it right so I can eliminate the pad when I scribble
Beer pong, I dabble; Shrooms on occasion, depending on the persuasion and who I'm with
Ask Ron Price, I was nice when I was younger
Yeah you was a Killer- "When You Were Young"
Though I'm 25 like I'm 16, first time high

Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed, indeed, just what I need
How I feel, upon a time, so recent in time, made me sad
When I recollect how it used to be
Like David and Goliath, kinda like me
And the Devil tryna rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no-no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in Hell

At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, no)

And they talk and judge a man
They have no clue of what I'm capable
'Til I show a side of me no one had thought could be within

I've achieved a bigger thing
No cash or check could be more blessed
And if you had ever seen the things I've seen up in my slumber
You'd be shook, stay awake
No need to run, your fate would follow
You should know, not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward
It's a goal, a simple code, I stay on the grind to the 25th hour
And I know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within
I told you, no, I'll never let you drag me down to Hell

But I be- the coolest mothafucka' "G" in the street

I come from Cleveland, y'all can really hear it now
Hit 'em like comic books, kaboom, pow-pow
Into a girl's mind, spit fine; no wine, dine
I keep two phones, sidekick for bad dimes
And a topical question is why I'm so chill
Girls don't understand, "He ain't even made a mill"
They say I'm Complex just like the magazine
I wear my closet Complex like the magazine
I get in their head
They don't even see my bread
Oh so, oh so fly
Cool as I wanna be, one hell of a guy
I keep 'em short and sweet, thick and petite

Some niggas sell CDs up out they trunk, man
Some niggas they go to school for that higher learnin'
I play the O'Jays, while I'm turnin' lanes
We be on our shit
Freakin' Black & Milds, still controllin' the whip
Ain't no city like Cleveland
Cruisin' with my bad bitch in the evenin'
You wanna know exactly why I'm this way?

A meal best served raw with a little steak sauce
Oh no, I bet you probably think I'm looney tune

See I was born back in '84
Without a damn clue what was in store
And furthermore even if I could bra
I do it all again real shit bra
Advocate rappin' and doing me
I ended up rapping renewing me
Ended up being better then the last
Whole new Cudder for the new class
Every time I think about the first step I ever took alone made me realize this prince was made for the throne
Defeated the beast, Sword from the stone, smoking so much weed I'm better off alone
In my own zone, in my own zone, I'm so gone never the less
I can't disappear stress, my life is way beyond your momma knows best
You can't forget I'm blessed, the feel is so curse, I can't stop the verse from spitting
Without feeling like I'm phony cause I speak my thoughts every time I think them up
I guarantee I will win if I was ever wrong this moment ain't it
So I am psychic in the in end, I think my thoughts and reality lets them
In, in, in, in

Two older brothers
And a single-parent mother who
Worked her ass off, did the best she could
There was nothing they could tell him
Let the boy know he wasn't worthless
Even though he was in the same home
He had felt alone, his pet gerbil passed on

Niggas is sign and dated like they recorded in fubu
Most niggas will quote you play scrabble with your words man
Till you see them at your shows is my dick that they blow man
I would sit up some nights and think about my own place
Probably cause I took so many blunts of Kush to the face
My bad thoughts I can’t erase
Or eat what’s on the devils plate
I just tell the devil wait
Cause murder will not be the case
In london with hudson
And them girls want some cuttin

"No guts, no glory", I always say

Along with inner peace, life will always be a grind
One day I'll be what the world want me to be
I was born to be super-duper Scott

Now super-duper fame gets me super-duper brains

I'm, I-I-I'm sky high
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Flashing lights
I go for mine, I got to shine
I'm sky high
Throw your hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody
Like we always do it this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
Feels good to be home baby, feels good to be home

Nigga I'm G-double-O-D Good
Back up in the blogs like a poppin' nigga should be
Never ever was a shoulda coulda woulda type
I am controlling what the people say they like
And no not the label, this is dream on
Play my songs so you can witness what I'm on
Besides 808's, okay now wait
When you hear my album it won't be hard to get a date
Yes M-dub it, I'm kickdrum strummin', hummin'
The product of a suburb is stonecold thorough
Very well-rounded, most people don't know though
Hey is that Diddy in that photo? (Hell yeah)
Back home they don't know what I have went through
To get to you, y'all, everybody

Hello, what it be
To you and yours

Salutations to all, you can call me Cudi
Or Mr. Extravagant 'cause I'm getting my money
Way my doors are swayin', it's like a bird on wheels
You can come to Ohio and you can see how it feels
And this the premier of that new-new here
It's gonna take you beyond
Where a jet can't Lear
But all you gon' hear
Is somethin' crazy in fact
How I be burnin' the booth
We'll get you looser than Yak
Yep-yep, you got it right
Now don't get left
Get on your good foot
It's only right that you step
And keep boppin' to this shit unfamiliar
If your main line got time then I be drillin' her
I keep you in my realm
I keep you in the sound
I keep myself up high
Because the haze by the pound
And my imagination
You can look all over the nation
But they ain't see

Salutations my niggas
I'm aware that I'm different
You can still keep it hood
While you're smokin' just listen
It don't matter your race
Just take a blunt to the face
And we all gon' rock
Got to keep up the pace
And them girls gon' twerk
Because the vibe is poppin'
As well as the bottles
Keep it rockin', don't stop 'em
At the Motel-8
We can park out front
Yeah the flow is unleaded
You sucka niggas will front
'Cause I'm Super-Cudder-Realistic-Leaner-Alidocius
And rap ferocious
I been coaching the league
I bobble head the public
If you love it, M dub it
Blood, sweat, and tears; homie, I'm made of it
Finish the class if you think nothing 'bout it
Tell 'em like grandpa, you don't know nothing 'bout it
Wear kicks once, then the Leaner come up out 'em
I been sayin' it, you was playin' him
Now you know
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop, it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
'Cause I provide

What it be to my ladies
With the bodies that kill
We ain't boppin' on money
Fuck with me 'cause you real
See you shakin' it fast
On some Mystical shit
You could slap that nigga
If he call you a bitch
Yeah I see you with that
But you should be on this
It's that Henney and Coca-Cola
Come over and sit
Won't you tell me your name
Tell me where you be at
I know you know that them hot
But I don't wanna hear that
You see I aim for a check
Before I aim for sex
Niggas aim for death
They tryin' to fuck with the blessed
Ain't no fuckin' with amateurs
Run passed the novice
Sip hella lean
To see who talks the slowest
Ain't no stoppin' me at all
You'd need a sawed-off, or maybe a chainsaw
And even at that
The crack that I brew is still new
Y'all niggas think acute
But Cudi is obtuse
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop, it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
