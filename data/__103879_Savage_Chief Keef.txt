We put that Jimmy Iovine money in the trap
Shout out to Young Scooter, man, he taught me that
We used put poles all in our videos, they copied that
Got Brutus on they car, no Forgiatos, damn
You Brick ass niggas don't know what to do
Y'all broke and y'all tired and y'all so confused
You don't know me, I'm Big Gucci Sosa to you
Disrespect my set then it's over for you
My young boys walkin' up and it's over with you
You ain't talkin' money, my convo over with you
My young boys walkin' up and it's over with you
You ain't talkin' money, my convo over with you
My young boys clap heat (Bang, bang)
My young boys don't care (Nah)
Yeah, them O'Block boys savage (O'Block)
Boy, don't go over there (Nah)

And if you think that you is tough (Huh?)
And you get popped, oh well (Oh well)
