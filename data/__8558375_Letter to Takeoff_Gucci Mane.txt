Letter to Take'
Huh?
Go

Just left another funeral, I shed a tear (Damn)
I'm still in disbelief, I can't believe it's real
I think about the memories, it give me chills
I'm wonderin' why they left the fake and took the real (Real)
Like, how the fuck we gon' lose Takeoff? Damn, he didn't deserve it
We don't supposed to question God, but, damn, Takeoff was perfect (God)
I go from sad to mad, I'vе been through every stage of griеf
We need some time to heal, but my job got no work relief (Nah)
See, we lost Shawty Lo, just months ago, lost PnB (Damn)
This world so crazy, you can't even take your chick to eat (Wow)
They way they killed that young boy X, it had me losin' sleep (X)
This shit hit close to home, it's really a sad sight to see (Sad)
They killed my nigga 'bout some candy, his folks blamin' me
Say all my artists go to jail and now they shamin' me (What the fuck?)
But I take it sober, like a soldier, I don't need a bean (Nah)
And I told Quavo to use my shoulder if he need to lean (Qua')
I tried to drown the pain away by drinkin' pints of lean (Lean)
Until I woke up in a hospital, it wasn't a dream
It's hard to not think about Dolph, his son, and little girl (Flippa)
And now I think about the life I'm 'bout to bring in the world (Me)
I said, "Don't diss the dead," they said, "Guwop's a hypocrite" (What?)
But I don't have the right to vote, I don't play politics (Nah)
They say I'm crazy and I just might be a little bit (I might)
But you all voted for Herschel Walker, you idiots (Wow)
The day we met, chain off my neck, you know I can't forget (Take')
He spoke on Take' with disrespect, got dropped, couldn't cash the check (Dropped)
R.I.P. my nigga Randy, died in front of Zesto's
I think about my mama passin', then I pray for Metro (Mom)
I think about my nigga Dame, we trapped all off the metro (Damien)
Beeper beepin' in the classroom, got to serve a zippo (True)
Ventin' 'bout my nigga Take' on a Zay instrumental (Ziggy)
You know I'll keep your name alive, you had so much potential (Take')
They sent you out in first class, the State Farm Arena
You had dope boys minglin' with rappers and singers
We lost my friend, we lost my dog, I lost my little brother
The last words you ever told me was, "Guwop, I love you" (Damn)
You might also like
Long live the Rocket
We love you, Takeoff
We miss you already
We never gon' forget you
My condolences to Mama Takeoff
Qua', Mama Huncho, Coach, the whole QC, Migo family
Let's start givin' our loved ones they flowers while they here
Because it's crazy out here
One day you're here, the next day you could be gone and it's sad
Takeoff, you will forever be in my heart
It's been over ten years since I met you at my studio
I knew immediately you would be a star
You left behind some amazing memories that will last forever
There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about you
We talk about you still and you will never be forgotten
Love, Gucci
