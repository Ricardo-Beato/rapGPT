Lately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much, heh-heh

As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too (Swishers too)
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm (Aha)
I'm just a regular kid (At my crib)
Doin' regular shit (Burnin' five spliffs)
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'ma pour another cup and roll another zone (Roll another zone)
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back (Bring me back)
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at (Aha)
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me? Hit me on Twitter, heh-heh
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name (Uh)
Waitin' at the station 'til it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune, fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin' 'bout ('Bout)
Pour a little liquor, then I drink it down
You might also like
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone (Spend another night alone)
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone, heh
I spend another night alone (Spend another night alone) (Yeah, yeah)

I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank God for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gates
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say, now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue
That's what I do, it's nothin' new

'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone (Spend another night alone) (Yeah)
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone, heh
I spend another night alone (Spend another night alone) (Yeah)
Night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone, heh23Embed
