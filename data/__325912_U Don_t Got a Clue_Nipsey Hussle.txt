12 ContributorsU Donâ€™t Got a Clue Lyrics
You Know, some things just got to be said
Marathon Music, uh

Look, you don't a clue of what you want to do
I'm busy gettin' rich, you think that I'm gon' stop for you?
I built this on my own and everybody know it's true
Still niggas act like they supposed to have control of what I do
But look, they don't got a clue of what I been through
Nigga ain't have no trust funds or eat off no silver spoons
Nigga ain't have no peace inside my house until I moved
And I damn sure can't recall havin' no exit route in you
But really, I don't got a clue of what you even do
And what good is a dream if you can't make yo shit come true?
What good is a team when everyone depends on you?
Hope opportunity don't knock, what opportunist in yo group?
'Cause then what you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
'Cause if you sharin' your success and not your struggle, you's a fool
Then you start to look like food, the game don't even chew
Eat you up and shit you out and then them critics say you through
But look, they don't got a clue what you was tryna do
Keepin' it one hunnid, one hunnid don't keep it you
But I'm gon' tell you what to do
Here is what you do
Say, "fuck the middle-man," get on your marathon and get your loot
I hustle 'cause I have to, not because it's cool
And over time became accustomed to the bullshit niggas do
Now I'm numb and it's cool, had to bounce back and regroup
Hope you don't expect shit from me, 'cause I don't want shit from you

Livin' life like we s'posed to
Fuckin' bitches like we s'posed to
Gettin' money like we s'posed to
Smokin' kush like we s'posed to1Embed
