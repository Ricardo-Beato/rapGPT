55 ContributorsGremlins Lyrics
I know some lil' niggas that thirst cream
That pop a bitch on camera and we ain't talking 'bout twerk team
Shooting up cribs turning porches to smokescreens
Momma smoking nightmares chasing her pipe dream
Hard to give advice behind a monitored call
So his limits Senim Sillas, cause his pop behind walls
School become a free meal, streets become a cheap thrill
Same prices pa paid, he gon' pay a cheap deal
Hourglasss empty but he looking for a refill
Revolver break dancing, yeah, he make that bitch windmill
Guess he's just a psycho in the city of the Chrysler
Everybody living spiteful nigga looking just to ice you
So we living hostile just to cop some Aeropostale
Trenchcoat Mafia, for a lil' Hollister
Gotta get his dollars up, so we hit the dice game
Lost all his re-up, now he rob the dice game
Probation violation call his ass the son of Satan
Got these old niggas scared, like it's Crystal Lake and Jason
Cause they been through cases, they ain't tryna go back
Fresh meat up on the street, he give a fuck about that
Snatching Cartie's downtown, wear 'em same damn week
Tryna get the same bitches on the same damn street
Rob a ho-ass nigga at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
You might also like
Cause they gremlins
Gremlins!

He just wanna smoke some kush
And fuck with some hoes at the mall
For that shit, he wished it all, baby face and all
My lil' nigga gotta ball, lil' nigga gotta ball
Run up on you where that money at, fuck nigga after that
Lean in that double cup, lil' nigga screwed up
Pop a pill nigga and he don' feel nigga
You do it in the song, he do it for real nigga
And all his OG's is either dead or in prison
Scared to talk to him like, fuck it, he won't listen
Unnecessary shit, thinking that he has to
A pair of True Religions dog, my lil nigga blast you
Listening to 2 Chainz, ain't thinking 'bout college
I wonder if he knew that 2 Chainz went to college
I wonder if he knew that, would that change his mind?
Guess that's something we'll find in due time4Embed
