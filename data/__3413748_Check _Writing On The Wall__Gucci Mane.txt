5 ContributorsCheck (Writing On The Wall) Lyrics
Last time I check
Last time thats thats
Last I check I got that scrap
Every time I wake
Every breath I take
Every time I walk
I got that safe
Yeah, I got that checks
Every time I check, yeah, stacks on deck
I use to push that back (listen)
Last time I check I got sticks in my bag

You ain't make a diss record I ain't heard that yet
But like Atlanta Falcons I drop bird shit
Niggas mad cause they ain't got on yet
Your 35 years old boy don't rap
Teenage year boy boy sold that straight
But ain't got the money to your found mixtape
I'm a product of the 6, nigga I'm that shit
So icey real estate, boy your section 8
First time second time third time can't slide
Drop top, chop shop - bye bye, bye bye
I'm Sunvalley shawty, homie ur not I
But if your from the east side must be 2 sides
Got a ninety thousands dollars walk threw the back
Blow handgun shawty chicken Popeye
I got a ninety thousands dollars walk in the back
And my plug filet mignon chicken pot pie
You might also like
Last time I check
Last time thats thats
Last I check I got that scrap
Every time I wake
Every breath I take
Every time I walk
I got that safe
Yeah, I got that checks
Every time I check, yeah, stacks on deck
I use to push that back (listen)
Last time I check I got sticks in my bagEmbed
