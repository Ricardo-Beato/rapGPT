16 ContributorsAston Martin Lyrics
On my wrist bout 40, one chain on my neck 15
This Tec with me hold about 50
Pull on his block like "Whatcha say about Lil Keef?"
Comin' through very foul with a referee
The only thing on my mind is money
That's why I don't know nothin' when you ask me somethin'
Been smokin' on dope in the fastest car
Bought 3 chains from Johnny Dang, coulda bought an Aston Martin

I got weed I don't need bitches
I got money I don't need friends
Me and B friends
Ben Franklin that's my best friend, we bendin'
Blocks, fuck with them make us put the heat in ya
With the opps, nigga, I can see the G in ya
Come in my house, we got dope all up in the weed vender
Come tryna rob, we gone make your dumb ass bleed, nigga
Flexin' on niggas like a sucka, he itchin' our finger
Pull up catch an opp then we gon' put racks on a nigga
Then shoot up the rest of the niggas
They gon' get the best of us, nigga

On my wrist bout 40, one chain on my neck 15
This Tec with me hold about 50
Pull on his block like "Whatcha say about Lil Keef?"
Comin' through very foul with a referee
The only thing on my mind is money
That's why I don't know nothin' when you ask me somethin'
Been smokin' on dope in the fastest car
Bought 3 chains from Johnny Dang, coulda bought an Aston Martin

Car go skurt-skurt, Tec go click-clak, tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh
Let a opp ride down the block like it's good good, we gon' tuh-tuh his windows
Got my Glock on me case a nigga think it's macaroni, smokin' on a big blunt of tooka
She ain't want me when I was in the hood hood
Now I'm rich, she say she got that good good
Pistols beat like KRK, we coming through day by day
We don't want no peace treaties, we don't want no dang all day
Wop made me up a peace treaty and we pulling off having a race
Walked in the bank with a smirk, walked out laughing away
I'm rich now, I can buy a school or a club or a business now
My niggas in the field still layin' fuck niggas down
These fuck niggas don't like how I'm living now

On my wrist bout 40, one chain on my neck 15
This Tec with me hold about 50
Pull on his block like "Whatcha say about Lil Keef?"
Comin' through very foul with a referee
The only thing on my mind is money
That's why I don't know nothin' when you ask me somethin'
Been smokin' on dope in the fastest car
Bought 3 chains from Johnny Dang, coulda bought an Aston Martin9Embed
