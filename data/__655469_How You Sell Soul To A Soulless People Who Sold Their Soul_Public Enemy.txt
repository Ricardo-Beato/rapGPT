8 ContributorsHow You Sell Soul To A Soulless People Who Sold Their Soul Lyrics
Banned from our damn so called country
No claim y'all know the goddamn name
Some got the rest of the planet to feel us damn it
Substance over style, that's right we on exile
Them ol' heads from strong out the velt
No love good looking out but damn sure felt
Hear me fear me appeared to disappear
The sequel said keep PE from the people
Stole your soul kept the groove on your body black
Now you can't get your mind back
Too dirty for the source power 30
Too clean for 30 year olds who wanna be sixteen
I beg your pardon we belive in other genres
You know what? While your favorites just starting
We come back to do a soul check
Every once in a while like a sonic You know what messiah
To find out these cats got this thing running wild
Oh, God bless the child

Soul Power 

I'm spitting in the wind 'til it knocks a tree down in the woods
(Allahu Akbar) God is good
Either you stand for something or fall for anything
You can get all the money cars and things and still have nothing
Looking for love in all the wrong places
Between getting high on the price tags and smilin' faces
Thinkin' you need rings and things rims and timbs
That ain't rap, that's being slaves again
Hip hop says you can be what you wanna be
As long as you ain't F-A-K-E
It is a four letter word like fame
That fades and if you believe it, you're F-U-C-K-E-D
But how you sell soul to a soulless people who sold their soul?
I guess we all got stole on
By some of the same cats that sold your soul out
G-wiz, bring the beat back, come on
