8 ContributorsDo It Lyrics
Okay, my momma not at home, so we gon' do this right
You ain’t gotta rush 'cause we ain't running outta time
You been eyeing me at school, talkin’ dirty on my line
And it started off "I like it from behind"
Shit, I ain't playing games witchu
I know what you came to do
I'm just tryna take my time and get a lil comfortable
I'm just tryna kiss yo' neck, you just wanna see me sweat
I need you to make it drip before I push your face in it

Shit, you ain't heard of that
Climb on top, I'm looking back
Leg up, I'm working that
He hitting hard, I’m hitting back
Boy, you better not spit me out
Keep my name all in your mouth
Let these hoes know where you go when you dip at night
Shit, I’m just tryna make it feel good for ya
Make you understand these other bitches ain't no good for ya
(Shit, I’m just tryna make it feel good for ya
Make you understand these other bitches ain't no good for ya)

Shit, shawty got me gone
Errytime she leave I be blowing up her phone
She ain't gotta beg for it she can get it when she want
Man it turn me on, errytime I hear your moans, it on
And I can get her how I wanna, make her do it real nasty
I get her how I wanna, make her do it real nasty
She got that good shit, I couldn't let her pass me
I get her how I wanna, make her do it real nasty
You might also like
If not me, then who? Who gon’ love you like I do?
Who gon' whip yo' dick out while you drive and suck you like I do?
Bitch, it's me, act like you know
Same bitch witchu when work slow
I'm the same bitch that was fuckin' witchu when your boys turned hoe
And there is no competition, he know what he be missing
These bitches is some fishes so they better get to swimmin'
He say "Loving you is wrong" when y'all know this nigga sinning
Niggas think they on my team when these niggas really pending

Shit, you ain't heard of that
Climb on top, I'm looking back
Leg up, I'm working that
He hitting hard, I'm hitting back
Boy, you better not spit me out
Keep my name all in your mouth
Let these hoes know where you go when you dip at night
Shit, I'm just tryna make it feel good for ya
Make you understand these other bitches ain't no good for ya
(Shit, I'm just tryna make it feel good for ya
Make you understand these other bitches ain't no good for ya)

Shit, shawty got me gone
Errytime she leave I be blowing up her phone
She ain't gotta beg for it she can get it when she want
Man it turn me on, errytime I hear your moans, it's on
And I can get her how I wanna, make her do it real nasty
I get her how I wanna, make her do it real nasty
She got that good shit, I couldn't let her pass me
I get her how I wanna, make her do it real nasty
Get her, get her how I wanna, make her do it real nasty
Get her, get her how I wanna, make her do it real nastyEmbed
