Oh my God, Ronny

The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it, too
I just gotta make a reservation
Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
Really, really runnin' out of patience

T— Timing, timing, timing
All about timing, timing, timing
Sit back in my chair, relaxing and reclining
He has not a care in the world, no, I'm lying
Takin' all these meds to the face got me flying
Takin' all these meds to the face got me dying
Smoke 'til my mind frying, eyes red, high and crying
Numb the pain with Oxy and Dior, yeah, pricey
Juice like 2Pac Shakur, no ice tea
Givenchy, Louis V, Double V, icy
Wedding ring, better things, better half, wifey
Only things numbing me from this hard life thing, uh, alright

The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it, too
I just gotta make a reservation
Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
Really, really runnin' out of patience

I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, sittin' up
Waiting, waiting, waiting, contemplating
My heart racing
Feels like I'ma die every second of the day
So I gotta get high
Ain't no coming down, ain't no coming down, why?
My anxiety bring me down, that's the fucking downside
It's like every time I ball, I just end up off-sides
This light of mine goes dim tonight
Will I be alright?
Let me guess, no answer, right?

The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it, too
I just gotta make a reservation
Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
Really, really runnin' out of patience93Embed
