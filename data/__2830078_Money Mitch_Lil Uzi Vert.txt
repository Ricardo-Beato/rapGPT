Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, what? Yeah, yeah
Yeah, what? Yeah

All your jewelry look funny
All your bitches look funny
All your money look funny
No big-face hundreds (Hey)
Yeah, Lil Uzi, huh, 1600 (Huh, huh)
Yeah, crib look like the Playboy mansion, got sixteen bunnies (Ayy)
Yeah, I'm the lover
Yeah, do what I wanna
Yeah, don't cop from that nigga right there 'cause he is a undie (12)
Yeah, 'member they ain't love me
Now these girls wanna hug me
Only said that 'cause their boyfriends listenin' but these girls wanna fuck me
Yeah, got the 'Rari
Saw the Wraith, run it (Skrrt)
Run it, run it (Yeah)
Run it (Yeah), run it, yeah
Now I'm on top of the game, I remember I was nothing (What?)
If I talk to you, girl, man, I swear you lucky
Ooh, swim in it
Ooh, let me touch it
Turn around, girl, let me bust it (Woo)
Running back, running back, rush it
Yeah, in Atlanta (In Atlanta)
Like I'm TJ Duckett (What?)
Dior suit
Take the arm and I cuff it (Ayy)
Trust no one for nothing (No)
Run up and they bust it (Bow)
Take Xans 'til I stumble (Woo)
Full bars, now I punt 'em
Look, she brung her friends, they wanna tumble (Yeah)
Talk to mines in the huddle
All my niggas, they some savages (Yeah)
You could leave 'em in the jungle (Jungle)
You could leave 'em in the desert (Yeah)
They some dogs, need a muzzle
Baby girl, turn around
I do not wanna cuddle (No)
Damn, you wet like a puddle, yeah
Said, you wet like a puddle, yeah
And I'm feelin' myself, what?
On a molly and an edible
Now your life is ahead of you (Yeah)
No one is ahead of you (No)
Mike Tyson, I'm impeccable (Yeah)
Man, I swear that's what this bread'll do (What?)

Got a white bitch, her name Connie (Yeah)

She give me brain, that's how I get knowledge (Huh)
In that studio rocking that Alyx (Yeah)
Yeah, smokin' gas got me high like a pilot (Huh)
Met a girl and she worked at that Follies
Met a girl that work at Magic City (City)
Yeah, the girl at Follies, she got the titties
The girl at Magic, she got the body
On the real neither one of them fit me (Uh)
Yeah, neither one of these girls get me, yeah
They only with me 'cause I got these hundreds and these fifties, yeah (What?)
Lil Uzi don't move with no twenties (No way)
Yeah, funny thing is that you really don't move with money (Yeah)
You still move with them tens and them fives (Yeah)
You still move with those nickels and dimes (What?)
You took that girl to, um, meet your mom (What?)
