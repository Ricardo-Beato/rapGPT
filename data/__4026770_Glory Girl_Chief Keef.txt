Shawty man, gone off the moon
I'm tryna go and she goes slow
Smoking on some loud and staying high like the Migos
Like she told me that she’s single
But I'm just tryna mingle
And when I be in that thing, shawty got that 
To look to the girls, all around the world
Like she know it's Glory boys, other nigga make her hurl
Sexy with them curls, worth a lot, like some pearls
When I gave her all of me, that bitch turned to a glory girl

She keep to my stacks, known for breakin’ backs
Like a shadow, random girls know me for spittin' cracks
Shawty sexy to the max and I gotta get her back
While I lay if its the crib, we know what happen after that
We be smokin' on that loud, she said I only sip goose
I said damn, me too, and so do all my troops
Shawty you could bring your girls, glory boys got hella guys
Like a thot, she a 
Like a bop, she be live
And she down, light my eyes up
Rollin with them skies, and I ain't never leaving her
I fucks with her, until we die
If she with it I'm with it, you know I'm gonna get her
I does what I want, im Chief Keef I'm that nigga

Shawty man, gone off the moon
I'm tryna go and she goes slow
Smoking on some loud and staying high like the Migos
Like she told me that she’s single
But I’m just tryna mingle
And when I be in that thing, shawty got that 
To look to the girls, all around the world
Like she know it's Glory boys, other nigga make her hurl
Sexy with them curls, worth a lot, like some pearls
When I gave her all of me, that bitch turned to a glory girl

I’m in and out of traffic, bad bitches laughing
Relaxing, in what we call the loud mansions
Product we be packing, it come from the Mexicans
Out of town trips got me feeling like a businessman
Big 54 zip
Get up on your business man
I pitch it man, roll it up and light it
I'm a Swisher fan
Blunt after blunt, call that shit ceiling fan
Stacking white O's, I'm tryna build a Michelin man
Picasso with a pistol, want me to paint a picture man?
Lil foe, running with the jam, he the cleaning man
New spot pay in advance in the minivan
They say its all in your head, 
Shawty man, gone off the moon
I’m tryna go and she goes slow
Smoking on some loud and staying high like the Migos
Like she told me that she's single

And when I be in that thing, shawty got that 
To look to the girls, all around the world
Like she know it's Glory boys, other nigga make her hurl
Sexy with them curls, worth a lot, like some pearls
When I gave her all of me, that bitch turned to a glory girl

Goddamn, lil bitch, she the best I ever had
Rolling with me, getting cash
Cops come, she taking 
Cause she know she getting bands
She was single, that's what's up
But I had to snatch her up
Don't no girl run in my 
But she so good to 
When I'm down she picking me up
Smoking on the downest zip and we up
In the back of the  and
