9 ContributorsPraying Right Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League
Yeah, uh-huh
You know what this is (Yeah, uh-huh)
If you don't, you better

Prayed for a Bentley last night
Maybe you ain't praying right
I know you prayed for a million last night
But maybe you ain't praying right (Let's go)

The future is sketchy, I'ma wait on the outcome
It's all in your head, it's 'bout the time that the doubt come
Ain't no retreat, I'm bouncing back on my feet, nigga
It's real in the field, you better buy you some cleats, nigga (Damn)
Woke up this morning, your problems big, you're feeling small
Woke up this morning, your problems really ain't big at all (Nah)
Limited life left, so go 'head and live it all
And you better be present my nigga, so you can feel it all
It was all a dream, just like Biggie, nigga
I-75, that far lane with that Iggy, nigga
I took it serious, I was never a silly nigga
I prayed a million times, I'm telling you really, nigga
You might also like
Prayed for a Bentley last night
Maybe you ain't praying right
I know you prayed for a million last night
But maybe you ain't praying right
Prayed for a Bentley last night
Maybe you ain't praying right
I know you prayed for a million last night
But maybe you ain't praying right (Let's go)

Now lay me down to sleep, 'cause talk is cheap
What you do when your old life is obsolete? (Woo)
They want you live ass backwards like the shit in reverse
Would you do it all over like this shit was rehearsed?
My nigga this ain't a show On Demand Xfinity
Overachieved the goal and tried to hit you with a penalty (Aye)
Your feet to the fire nigga, evolve or die, nigga
He tellin' you different, your big homie a lie, nigga
If ever I lost it all, wouldn't lose my faith, nigga
Grind til' I'm dead before I fuck up my face, nigga
I took it serious, I was never a silly nigga
I prayed a million times, I'm telling you really nigga

Prayed for a Bentley last night
Maybe you ain't praying right
I know you prayed for a million last night
But maybe you ain't praying right (Let's go)
Prayed for a Bentley last night
Maybe you ain't praying right
I know you prayed for a million last night
But maybe you ain't praying right (Let's go)
Prayed for a Bentley last night
Maybe you ain't praying right
I know you prayed for a million last night
But maybe you ain't praying right (Let's go)
Prayed for a Bentley last night
Maybe you ain't praying right
I know you prayed for a million last night
But maybe you ain't praying right (Let's go)Embed
