(Turbo)
Sosa Baby
Bitch, bitch, bitch
O Block, 300 (Turbo)

Nigga, go and get that check
Check, check, check, check, check, check
Just be all about the
Check, check, check, check, check, check
I'm in the mall runnin' through a
Check, check, check, check, check, check
Sneak diss, you can get your ass
Checked, checked, checked, checked, checked, checked
All I wanted was a check

All I wanted was a check
What you give is what you get
Make mistakes with no regrets
Take a bag and call me that
Take a pill and call me flat
She like, "You ain't call me back"
Look at how I float the Wraith
I got astronomic swag
Call me Mr. Poppin' Tags
Caught your bitch poppin' ass
In the mall, droppin' cash
Heavy like a body bag
Call my Kay Kay line and she got the tsunami swag
I just left Wells Fargo depositing a lot of cash
All I want, is a check
Swear to God, on the set
Whip whip, make it stretch
I'ma come back and flex
I'm ridin' with the fuckin' toolie, bang bang you fuckin' mooly
My life is fuckin' Gucci and I get fuckin' coochie
You might also like
Nigga, go and get that check
Check, check, check, check, check, check
Just be all about the
Check, check, check, check, check, check
I'm in the mall runnin' through a
Check, check, check, check, check, check
Sneak diss, you can get your ass
Checked, checked, checked, checked, checked, checked
All I wanted was a check

War ain't what you want
We can get it on
I still tote a gun
To shoot I'm the first one
She say she like my Louis
Big chicken and blue cheese
I'm in that zoom like Boosie
Salute me or shoot me

Nigga, go and get that check
Check, check, check, check, check, check
Just be all about the
Check, check, check, check, check, check
I'm in the mall runnin' through a
Check, check, check, check, check, check
Sneak diss, you can get your ass
Checked, checked, checked, checked, checked, checked
All I wanted was a check
I'm on an ATV in my backyard
Came a long way from the Chiraq yard
Slide down a nigga, pull his mac card
Then I hit Gucci with a black card
Everybody be on that gang shit
I didn't even know we was that large
I didn't even know I went that dumb
Foreigns in the shit that crash cars
You know I'm smokin' on dope
You can get hung with a rope
Hundred bands in my pocket
I throw twenty of it on the floor
Got blue cheese in the strip club
I throw twenty of 'em on a hoe
I'm in that bitch doin' the most
And I got Bonecrusher with me, let's go
O Block, Sosa Baby

Nigga, go and get that check
Check, check, check, check, check, check
Just be all about the
Check, check, check, check, check, check
I'm in the mall runnin' through a
Check, check, check, check, check, check
Sneak diss, you can get your ass
Checked, checked, checked, checked, checked, checked
All I wanted was a checkEmbed
