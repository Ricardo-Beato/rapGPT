11 ContributorsGlamorous_Ref Lyrics
Goddamn, my life is so glamorous
Surrounded by money and cameras
That Hollywood life, it do damages
Cut you deep down with no bandages
Goddamn, my life is so glamorous
That Hollywood life, it do damages
But nobody's painting this picture
'Cause we on devices, and threw out the canvases

Fuck who the greatest, soon as I drop it they play it
Ain't stacking no cheese, I serrate it
All of your shit is outdated
You bring me the beef, I'll filet it
Deon bring me the beat, I'll replay it
Bobby you know he gon' slay it
Just me and the homie from Fayette

Police wanna take my lifе
Emcee wanna take my spot
But they don't give a damn, what I got
Might gеt got, but then again not
I drop beats on the MP, feelin' empty
I'ma beat them to death like No I.D
Streets full of envy, wanna kill me
'Cause I made a lot of money and I'm still me
Dollar dollar bill don't thrill me, know somebody feel me
Not Logic, but the real me, under the surface
I'm rhyming with purpose I know I ain't perfect
I'm Kirk and you irking me?
All these go-getters ain't what they assert to be
I am the universe, you Captain Kirk to me
Nothing but regurgitated, far from innovative
I made it, I'm hated, I'm feeling elated
You might also like
Man fuck who the greatest, soon as I drop it they play it
Ain't stacking no cheese, I serrate it
All of your shit it outdated
You bring me the beef, I'll filet it
Deon bring me the beat, I'll replay it
Bobby you know he gon' slay it
Just me and the homie from Fayette

Fuck my Rolex, fuck my Rolodex
We live in a Matrix, we live in a holiday
Watch how you talk to people, everything you do effect
Treat people with love, treat people with kindness
Treat them with respect
Innovate, innovate, set to kill and disintegrate
Innovate, innovate, set to kill and disintegrate
Ready set, coming for your neck
Ace in the deck, noose around your neck
In effect, coming to collect, like a payphone
Better pray for 'em, keep it A1 for my day ones
People hating on the internet but then in person
They the same ones sucking my dick
Talking 'bout Bobby, you know I love the way you spit
Knowing goddamn well they don't really give a shit
And they be like, "Can I get one for the Gram? You're the man, let me shake your hand, I mean, I'm a really big fan, no I am, I'm a stan off-camera"
Fuck who the greatest, soon as I drop it they play it
Ain't stacking no cheese, I serrate it
All of your shit it outdated
You bring me the beef, I'll filet it
Deon bring me the beat, I'll replay it
Bobby you know he gon' slay it
Just me and the homie from Fayette

Goddamn, my life is so glamorous
Surrounded by money and cameras
That Hollywood life, it do damages
Cut you deep down with no bandages
Goddamn, my life is so glamorous
That Hollywood life, it do damages
But nobody's painting this picture
'Cause we on devices, and threw out the canvasesEmbed
