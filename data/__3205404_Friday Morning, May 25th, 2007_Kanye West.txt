Hello Ladies and Gentlemen
It’s Friday morning, May 25th, 2007
You know I never say the dates but since this is a mixtape
I might as well mark the day our lives changed
This a whole new world out there
I’m speaking to you from the future right now
I mean, at all times, I was always speaking to you from the future
They say music change a lot since saw you first drop
I say music gon’ change a lot after I drop
And the polo is Versace by the way
Maison Margiela, Dior, what have you, partake
And the Jordans is the sixers
Y’all don’t see, I be, Gemini
L, G, Hip Hop, rock, K
Yeah, Jay, uh, LA, J Brown, ta ta
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Are y’all all ready for this ride?
Are you all ready for the ride?
I’ma stop playing with they emotions
Plain Pat, let’s goYou might also like1Embed
