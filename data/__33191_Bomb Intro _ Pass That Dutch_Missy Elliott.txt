36 ContributorsBomb Intro / Pass That Dutch Lyrics
Listen up, everyone
We have been just informed that there's an unknown virus that's attacking all clubs
Symptoms have been said to be
Heavy breathing, wild dancing, coughing
So when you hear the sound "hootie hoo"
Run for cover, motherfucker

Mm (Woo)
Oh, daddy
Oh (Ooh)
Oh (Ah, woo)
Pass that Dutch (Ah), pass that Dutch (Ooh)
Pass that Dutch (Ah), pass that Dutch (Ah)
Pass that Dutch (Ah), pass that Dutch (Ah)
Pass that Dutch (Woo), pass that Dutch

Misdemeanor on the floor, pretty boy, here I come
Pumps and a bump make you wanna hurt somethin'
I can take your man, I don't have to sex 'em
Hang 'em out the window, call me Michael Jackson (Hee)
I'm a pain in your rectum
I am that bitch y'all slept on
Heavy hitter, rhyme spitter, call me Rerun
Hey, hey, hey, I'm what's happenin'
Hpnotiq in my drink (That's right)
Shake ya ass 'til it stink (That's right)
Mr. Mos' on the beat (That's right)
Put it down for the streets (That's right)
You might also like
(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch (Come on, pass the Dutch, baby)
Shake, shake, shake ya stuff, ladies
(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it 'til ya clothes get wet

Number one, drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make your pum pum jump
If you's a fat one, put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
I'm under attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'
(Whoop-whoop) Who touched my car alarm?
Break in my car, you will hear "Viper armed"
I've been a superstar since Daddy Kane was raw
I'm live on stage, c'mon and give me some applause

Thank you
Oh, thank you, you all are so wonderful
(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch (Come on, pass the Dutch, baby)
Shake, shake, shake ya stuff, ladies
(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it 'til ya clothes get wet

Listen up, motherfuckers
You have five seconds to catch your breath
Five, four, three, two, one

Pop that, pop that, make that money
Just keep it going like the Energizer Bunny
Shake that, shake that, move it all around
Spank that, yank that, Dutch back now
Freak him, freak her, whatever your choice
Didn't come to judge, I came to get ya moist
Scream "hootie hoo" now my voice is lost
Can I get a ride on the white horse?

(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch (Come on, pass the Dutch, baby)
Shake, shake, shake ya stuff, ladies
(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it 'til ya clothes get wet
Pop that
Pass the Dutch, baby
Jiggle that fat5Embed
