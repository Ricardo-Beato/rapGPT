6 ContributorsRock Show Lyrics
Yo!  D.. J.. Run!  D.. Mmmmmmm C!
Yeah, what?  Kings, of, rock!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Echo tech, b-boy down..

I wanna rock right now
DJ Run and I'm claimin my crown
I be internationally known
Even got chrome on my microphone
I ain't stupid, y'all outrageous
Actin like Run can't rock all ages, so
DON'T, act like y'all don't know
Run been rockin since Kurtis Blow
Me and my brother been gettin this dough
Came in the do', said it befo'
These are the kings from around the way
Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay..
{*scratched: "I'm the king.. of rock!"*}

Alright, never lose your flow
In the end it's just a rock show
Alright, alright, alright
In the end it's just a rock show
You might also like
Y'all wanna know what it takes to be
An MC like D in the place to be
And got a house on the hill for my family
With the grass more green than a gram of weed
Stars in the cars on the way to my show
Gettin rah at the bar when they drinkin the Mo'
With a cigar in the palm steady gettin the dough
Ain't nuttin changed but the lane and the Range a Rove'
Just, cause y'all know my name
Heard my fame and seen my game
Don't mean I'm all about the glitter and flam
The king of rock is who I am
Raw, we are, by law
First one rockin these Adidas y'all saw
Jumped on tour way back in eighty-four
Jay, Run, D. Mac smack back up at your door

Alright, never lose your flow
In the end it's just a rock show
Alright, never lose your flow
Cause in the end it's just a rock show
Alright, never lose your flow
Cause in the end it's just a rock show
Alright, alright, alright
In the end it's just a rock show
Alright, alright, alright
In the end it's just a rock show
Hey y'all it's me from the Three Beezies
N.Y.C. is sucker free just to show y'all it could be done
Step up and funk everyone
And we're out..
You can't touch this, you can't touch this, can't touch this
You can't touch this, you can't touch this..Embed
