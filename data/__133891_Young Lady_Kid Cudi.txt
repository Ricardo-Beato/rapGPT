46 ContributorsYoung Lady Lyrics

In my head your smile appears clear
Wish it wasn't my imagination running away with a dream
Your eyes they tell it all called it
Hope you have a good heart and you're smart
You've got a good head on your shoulders

That's what turns a nigga on, strong feelings that I have
You'll probably never, find out ever
I'll admire from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady

Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on young lady
You might also like
How'd you get so fuckin cool?
Fools probably try to spit at you daily
The price you pay cause you're hot
Has anyone told you that you're fresh as hell
And I dig the way you wear your hair too
It makes you look more mature
See I just wanna be a man and I think you can be the one to guide me
But who the fuck am I kidding
Man you know they say I'm wild
But real people rarely come around if ever
You got it going on, young lady

Jesus Christ, girl! (Oh)
You got it goin' on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl! (Oh)
You got it goin' on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl! (Oh)
You got it goin' on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl! (Oh)
You got it goin' on young lady


You turn a nigga on, these feelings I have
You'll find out never, unless you're clever
I'll admire you from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl! (Oh)
You got it goin' on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl! (Oh)
You got it goin' on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl! (Oh)
You got it goin' on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl! (Oh)
You got it goin' on young lady29Embed
