Livin' good, I've been livin' good
Rollin' through my hood, understood (Yeah)
Just a youngin in this bitch up to no good (Yeah)
In the whip, every day with Nikki, she be riding with me (Yeah)
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties (Yeah)

Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang, no, they know
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the fame, yeah-yeah)
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the...)
We've been at it way before the fame, psych

Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it (Yeah-yeah)
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit (Yeah-yeah)
No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this (Nah, nah)
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do (If you 'bout it)
Seems like all this new shit really just leftover residue
I'm coming through, if I see your bitch I bet she coming too
What it do, we ain't never switch it up, we keep it true
You might also like
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the...) (Yeah)
Way before the fame, ho
(Way before the...) (Yeah)
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)

Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)
We've been at it way before the fame
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
We've been at it way before, way before the fame
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)

Back again, like I never left
Had to take a breath (Yeah-yeah)
'Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore
God-Goddamn (Bounce)
That's my fucking jam, they know who I am (Yeah-yeah)
Bitch bounce
Homie smoke a ounce
Fuck it, make it count (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa (Killa)
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl
RattPack, know the deal
What's the motto? Keep it real!
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it
We live in an era where they get deleted
I'm wondering if I'ma make it
Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going, that's why I be flowin'
I'm already knowing this life that I'm livin'
Don't know what I'm given
It's so hard not to give in
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho (Yeah, yeah)
Wa-wa, wa-way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)

Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)
We've been at it way before the fame
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
We've been at it way before, way before the fame
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)
