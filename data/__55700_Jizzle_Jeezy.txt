7 ContributorsJizzle Lyrics
Don't let me rip shit for ya
Still come through ya
Panoramic ass niggas
Yeah I shoot right straight for ya
Hole in ya nigga yeah you gon’ need a ruler
The way I measure that, you can call me the ruler
Walk up in this motherfucker like a walking cooler
Yeah I'm a walking cooler nigga thanks to my jeweler
Oh kimosabe
Big ballin’ is my hobby
I should buy a double up
And throw a party in the lobby
Said a homeboy told her
I was fucking Roxy
Swear I hate niggas
I should be a fucking Nazi
Don't know what you hear
Baby that could be a rumor
Stones in my ear
Yeah, that could be a tumor

Shawty Redd on the drums, it's a hit
Yeah we got Jizzle in the booth talkin’ shit
Give it to ya hard cause we know you like that
Shawty tell ‘em what it is, they don’t know me like that
Go Young on ‘em, go Young on ‘em (I'm goin’ Young)
Go Young on ‘em, go Young on ‘em (I'm goin’ Young)
Go Young on ‘em, go Young on ‘em (I'm goin’ Young)
Go Young on’ em, go Young on’ em (I'm goin’ Young)

Young Jizzle what's wrong what are you sayin’?
Say somethin’ wrong, what's that what are you payin’?
It's 2010 and you payin Patrick Ewing
Last time I payed that number I was wearin’ Patrick Ewing
At the end of every song you be talkin’ about work
I said as far as I'm concerned motherfucker you a jerk
Real niggas love it when I talk that shit
Can't wear skinny jeans cause my Glock won't fit
How you make it out the streets?
I tell ‘em “Lord knows”
You met the Feds outside
You better off doin’ shows
What you play for?
I said you're goddamn right
They need a real nigga homie give me that mic
Shawty Redd on the drums, it's a hit
Yeah we got Jizzle in the booth talkin’ shit
Give it to ya hard cause we know you like that
Shawty tell ‘em what it is, they don’t know me like that
Go Young on ‘em, go Young on ‘em (I'm goin’ Young)
Go Young on ‘em, go Young on ‘em (I'm goin’ Young)
Go Young on ‘em, go Young on ‘em (I'm goin’ Young)
Go Young on’ em, go Young on’ em (I'm goin’ Young)
Might as well do this motherfucker strapped up, ain't I?
Pull this motherfucker out and blast a bitch, can't I?
I said I break that ho down and unwrap a bitch, can't I?
Doin’ what I wanna don’t have to ask a bitch “can I?”
And after this song I'm a make a diss album
One thing about you ain't makin’ this album
Young against the world when I was makin’ this album
Goin’ on my 4th feel like my 6th album
What you need 3 grand? I got all 3 thousand
3 dead lie youg pocket 3 thousand
Paco said he was cool
Then why the fuck is he wildin’?
Ain't said shit funny so why the fuck is you smilin’?
Shawty Redd on the drums, it's a hit
Yeah we got Jizzle in the booth talkin’ shit
Give it to ya hard cause we know you like that
Shawty tell ‘em what it is, they don’t know me like that
Go Young on ‘em, go Young on ‘em (I'm goin’ Young)
Go Young on ‘em, go Young on ‘em (I'm goin’ Young)
Go Young on ‘em, go Young on ‘em (I'm goin’ Young)
Go Young on’ em, go Young on’ em (I'm goin’ Young)Embed
