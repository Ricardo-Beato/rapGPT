5 ContributorsTime and Time Again Lyrics
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh, oh yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh, oh yeah (Music)
Oh, yeah
(Music) Oh, yeah, yes (Woo)

The things you say to me can't make or break me
Everything you bought I give back absolutely everything
And, I am through wit'chu, you and your crazy moods
You be trippin', and slippin', and givin' attitude (Holla)
I deserve the finer things (Yes), the joy that love brings (Yes)
And you'll be missin' my kisses, and makin' love scenes (Oh)
I'm better off alone ('Lone), can't wait 'til you get gone (Gone)
Ain't no need to keep hopin' 'cause it's over and done

Why do you keep comin' back time and time again? (Oh, yeah-yeah)
You promised me you'd change your ways, time and time again
I heard the same old line from you time and time again
And why I take you back? Because I cannot change a man

(Why do you) Why do you keep comin' back time and time again? (Oh, yeah-yeah)
You promised me you'd change your ways, time and time again (Hey, hey)
I heard the same old line from you time and time again
And why I take you back? Because I cannot change a man (Yes)
You might also like
No use in talkin' (No), better get to walkin'
Better get them chicks who turn tricks, 'cause I'm just too smart, man
I hate men who lie (Yes), who look me in my eyes
Come up with alibis for the thousandth time
I won't take bullshit, leave ya ass wit' the quickness
Because I'm stable and able to live my life alone
Boy, I'm through wit'chu, no more to say or do
'Cause you're too confused, and it's over and done

Why do you keep comin' back time and time again?
You promised me you'd change your ways, time and time again (Oh, yeah)
I heard the same old line from you time and time again
And why I take you back? Because I cannot change a man (Oh-oh, I-I)

Why do you keep comin' back time and time again? (Oh, why, why? I)
You promised me you'd change your ways, time and time again
I heard the same old line from you time and time again
And why I take you back? Because I cannot change a man

I be comin' wit' a rap on a ballad
You should vote Misdemeanor on your ballots
'Cause you know I blow your mind anytime that I rhyme, and I'll be down for a challenge
I'm wicked, I-C-K, â€“icked, not Twista twisted
From coast to coast, I brag and boast
I'm better than most insufficient
I got that good love, that goody-goody-good love
That puddy-puddy-pusha
Slick talkin' sister to any nigga that wanna get with her
Don't never diss her, M, dot, S-E
And let me stop playin' wit' y'all motherfuckers
This ain't no rap record, get back to the hook
Why do you keep comin' back time and time again?
You promised me you'd change your ways, time and time again
I heard the same old line from you time and time again
And why I take you back? Because I cannot change a man

Why do you keep comin' back time and time again?
You promised me you'd change your ways, time and time again
I heard the same old line from you time and time again
And why I take you back? Because I cannot change a manEmbed
