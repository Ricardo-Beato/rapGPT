7 ContributorsJust Saying LyricsIntro:
OLYMPICKS OH-LYMPICKS 
Look... look
I'm just saying though  
I'm just saying though 
I'm just saying though  
Verse 1:
Mixtape shit this my mixtape bitch
Trap or Die II what the fuck did you expect
Def Jam on the phone, tell them niggas cut the check
And when it get here shit better be correct
I vow that i'll never ever lose my respect
Like that time in Cancun when I lost my begets
Niggas acting like they lost on some shit I might address 
Nothing but the real
Nothing more nothing less
I don't wanna be apart of ya rap contest
If thats the case nigga then it's no contest 
Yeah, I said no contest
I'm a street nigga bitch I got no con-science
Heartless, where the motherf-cking wizard
Used to see me in the lamp I'm like the motherf-cking wizard
Gotta whip that shit like an oreo blizard, tryna get that green like the Geico lizard
Shit so easy a caveman can do it, put the fork in the bowl nigga its nothing to it
In a circular motion like a merry go round, then its "uh uh uh", yeah that merry go sound
Use a stryofoam cup nigga and just lean
Now you too can be a lean cooking machine
Maybe one day I might right a cook book
But one thing about its gonna be a good book
You might also likeI'm just saying though 
Yeah, This is Trap or Die II nigga
I'm Just saying though 
Verse 2:
Look.. look look 
I'm just saying though
I hope you niggas listening
Half you niggas ain't even worth mentioning 
So I don't even mention them
Cause thats just like lynching them 
Then its young jizzle in a lynch mob 
Niggas like Re rock, they just act hard 
Stay the fuck up outta mine
It ain't that hard
Make you wanna buy 100 bricks on ya black card 
Bought some Jordan's and some Air Max
Make you want 1,000 pounds on ya Air Max 
And I'm talking that mid
Man the real niggas love when I be talking that shit
Can't comprehend, a whole nother conversation
Bitch I'm bout to drop a ya-yo compilation
Call it stunt history cause my history stunt
Either that or white history month
Like a repeat bitch, yeah I run straight threw it
Real nigga talk, yeah I speak that fluent
Been getting money cause that's part of my culture
20 years old with my eyes on them posters
I'm just saying though...
