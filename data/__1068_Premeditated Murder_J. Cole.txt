Yeah, hey
Hey

Yeah, am I changing right before your eyes? Huh
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a 7, must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband then, nigga
You might also like
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it, either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned it so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth it for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I'd give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke? You would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me?
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though, I'm never going back
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
Hey, you know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
Hey, you know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

I can't keep running away
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back one day
Hey
What if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all them people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me
Hey, hey, hey, alright18Embed
