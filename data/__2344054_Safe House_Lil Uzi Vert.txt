T-T-T-That be Maaly Raw!

Oh, no one's safe nowadays (No)
You ain't safe in the safe house (No)
Get money out the safe house (Yeah)
Put the choppers in the safe house (Chopper)
In the kitchen, I'll whip it, yeah (Yeah)
Pockets got extra cake now (Now)
SLS up in L.A. (Yeah), up in playhouse, Meek Wraith now (Meek Mill)
Matter fact, it was Maybach, just a new one (Yeah)
Bad bitch gon' lay back (Yeah)
Watch all the damn paper stack (Yeah)
Beefing with niggas I don't even know
Say you gon' kill me, I'ma wait for that (I'ma wait for it)
She shake her ass I smack that
Man, show it off, I'll pay for that (Ten thou')
I'm a boss, bitch, what it cost, bitch?
Got workers, I ain't weighing jack (Oh)
Margiela with the RAF shit
Got all this, I'm laying that (Oh)
I ain't got no real problems, if I do, AK in that
That cocaine, she love it
My bad bitch, she tasting that
Steph Curry with the ball status
Swerving, swerving 'round in all traffic (Swish)
Got a white bitch with a brawl status
I wrestle her like Trish Stratus (Trish)
Nigga, I just didn't know Lil Uzi Uzi had been had it
Nigga, you don't know my business
Better watch out 'cause I've been trapping
I remember my grandma was nickled up (Ooh)
Now I'm rolling, rolling with the bezel diamonds (Damn)
Shine jeweler like Rick the Ruler
Now a nigga always there shining (Shining)
Fucked on that stripper bitch
Hit that bitch without a condom (Condom)
We'll ride up to CVS with the Plan B that was sixty dollars (Sixty)
