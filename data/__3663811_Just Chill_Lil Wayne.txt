36 ContributorsJust Chill Lyrics
Verify, got haircut
Mu in this bitch, Scoob in this bitch with me

So much shit on my mind, I just hope I don't smell like it
The motherfuckers pointing fingers
Be the same ones that have nail bitin'
Real niggas, still real niggas, you new niggas, just lil' niggas
When ya shit fall, don't be surprised
Acting like you didn't hear timber
I'm caffeinated, I'm half-sedated
I started from the bottom, I gravitated
I'm validated, I'm a trigger happy nigga
And it's sad to say it, but I had to say it
I had to do it, I had to stunt, act like I had what I had for once
With all of my thank yous added up
I still can't thank Birdman enough, I woke up in a new Tyra Banks
I've been gettin' money since Shabba Ranks
The car I'm in brand spankin' new, it just got spanked
Real niggas say rest in peace to DJ Screw
Rest in peace to Pimp C too
Fuck your bulletproof vest (blat) I still need proof, my nigga
I hate you like mustard, I'm disgustin'
I'm aiming at your chest, hit your face, I'm just rusty
Cherish every step that we take, some of us clumsy
Lookin' for a breath of fresh air, it's hidin' from me, fuck
Mall roll it up in the leaf, weed stronger than Zangief
I last longer than an antique, her pussy cummin' like a stampede
She cooks, fucks and clean, the type of bitch that every man need
The type of bitch that every man leave
That ain't cool, and she wearin' sleeves, but chill, just chill
You might also like
Girl, you gotta chill, uh, I just gotta tell you how I feel, yeah
Girl, you gotta chill, uh, you know that I'll always keep it real
You just need to chill, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Yeah, girl, you gotta chill

You could fuck all these bitches, except my bitches
Yeah right, I wish, with all three wishes
Man I swear she got too attached, had to cut the umbilical
Man I swear I'm so armed, I feel like I got tentacles
Niggas bumpin' their gums, I feel like Orajel
Got 'em scratchin' their head, combin' out broken nails
See I give 'em my love, but I'm an indian giver
Got my ear to the streets, I hear the enemy whisper
I break the bank with a sledgehammer
Cellphone rings like Saturn
Bitch let a nigga breathe, breathe like a dragon
I hide money everywhere, that's my hidden talent
One time for them gangstas, fuck that, two times for them gangstas
If you got a problem, I'll fix that like, yeah nigga I'm maintenance
Got a bad bitch and she anxious, bitch, you just an acquaintance
I'll ask a rat, "Why be a rat?" then kill him while he explainin'
Tell your foot soldiers to walk light, handful of real niggas left
And if any nigga wanna step to me tell 'em hurry up and take bigger steps
My bitch deep, I get in depth, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
She dyed her pussy hair red, she said she had to roll the red carpet out
That's real
So real
Yeah, you know that I'll always keep it real
You just need to chill, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
I just gotta tell you how I feel, yeah, girl you gotta chill
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Yeah, girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill
Girl, you gotta chill

Yeah, Tunechi
Shawty is you gon' ride 'til it's over? (Ride, 'til it's over)
Man we gettin' high, never sober (High, never sober)
Still ridin' dirty 'til it's over (haaan, ayy, ayy, ayy)5Embed
