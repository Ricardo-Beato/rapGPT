Uhh

B.I.G. is making this cream
Bitches always say what the hell does that mean?
B is for the bitches, who can't understand
How one fly nigga became a man
I is for the way it goes in and out
One by one I knocks 'em out
G is for the way the game goes in the gutter
Other MC's man they ain't sayin' nuthin'
Rockin' on, to the break of dawn
Meet the bitch, get the pussy, get the math, I'm gone

What?
It ain't no more to itYou might also like6Embed
