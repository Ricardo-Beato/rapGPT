5 ContributorsSuicide Watch Lyrics

Hello? Oh shit, nigga, oh shit
What the fuck is going on?

(When I die fuck it, I wanna go to hell)
I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell (yeah)
(Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion)
I know my momma wish she got a fucking abortion (yeah)
(When I die fuck it, I wanna go to hell)
I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell (uh huh)
(Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion)
I know my momma wish she got a fucking abortion

Some niggas is broke, trying to be on some don shit
Me? I'm a grunt, comfortable in that conflict
Go 'head nigga stunt, it's cool 'til I get on it
You can keep the blunt, but that chain, nigga, we want it
Call it a jux or whatever you wanna call it
Call the police and get hit with a clip for it
You know how I move, that semi here on my waistline
Ain't nobody ever gave me shit, nigga, I take mine
I run in your crack house, MAC out, screaming "Go 'head make me"
Duct-tape you, the fiends and that snotty nose baby
Calm down and cooperate 'fore I hit you
With some shit that doc'll operate for hours you coward
You might also like
(When I die fuck it, I wanna go to hell)
I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
(Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion)
I know my momma wish she got a fucking abortion
(When I die fuck it, I wanna go to hell)
I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
(Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion)
I know my momma wish she got a fucking abortion

I tried to keep it cool these hobby niggas make me violent
I split your fucking head, yeah, that would stop your ass from whining
Baby, I'm delusional, distorted, no defying
You think you can play me? Pussy, go 'head, nigga, try it
I fell I broke my arm, I felt pain when I was six
They kill mommy at it, by 12 I was selling knicks
See me I'm a survivor, I tell a nigga suck a dick
And niggas know I'm strapped so they ain't saying shit
Me? I'm a party pooper, I be fucking up the fun
These niggas wanna stunt, I wanna get at 'em with my gun
Since a little nigga, I been on the same shit
Don't act like something new when you see niggas getting hit (What up, BIG?)

(When I die fuck it, I wanna go to hell) uh huh
I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell (whaat?)
(Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion)
I know my momma wish she got a fucking abortion
(When I die fuck it, I wanna go to hell)
I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
(Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion)
I know my momma wish she got a fucking abortion
I'm Notoriousssss!
Biggie ain't around, now you need me, alright?
I'm Notoriousssss!
You can chill with 'Pac, nigga, in your next life
I'm Notoriousssss!

It's 50, nigga, I'm back mashed, what's up?
Man, this shit getting ready to change, man, telling you, mane
Motherfucking gangstas can't do the skanky leg
What's next, mane?
You gon' be dropping it low like a stripper? Oh, shit
I'm trying to fit in and I can't fit in, damn, I'M BACK, BABY!Embed
