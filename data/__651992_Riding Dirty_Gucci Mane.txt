7 ContributorsRiding Dirty Lyrics
Fuck an informer, fuckin’ told ya, fuckin’ cockroaches
I ain't eyeballing shit, nah, it all mine nigga
I ain’t selling shit clean anymore nigga

Man I ain’t eyeballing shit I let the scale do it (fuck that shit)
Man I ain’t riding cross the country I let the mail do it (say what)
I know them cops on my chop, But I just sell music
These niggas don’t have heart to fight, they’d rather let 12 do it
I’d rather be judged by twelve than carried by six niggas (fosho)
I feel like a one man army I got like six clips nigga
You know one than bout lil pimpin’ nigga, he never slippin’ nigga
I come through light up your block like it was christmas nigga (Wooooho)

Riding Dirty man they said that I had 9 Birdies, 9 Birdies
Man they tryna’ catch me Riding Dirty, Riding Dirty
Got 2 guns you know I’m Riding Dirty
Riding Dirty, Riding Dirty, nigga Riding Dirty
Riding Dirty, man them folks so I sent nine birdies
Nine birdies, thats the verdict nigga, nine birdies, nine birdies nigga
Man I got this dirty 30, dirty pistol, I’m a motherfuckin’ dirty nigga
Dirty nigga I spent like 80 thousand for Bart Simpson
I was tripping’ then I went and spent a whole million
Whole million yeah I got a whole buncha green bills
Got a fork and I got them bands in them
You might also like
I wish I would catch a nigga with his hands in it
Find that nigga dead with his fuckin’ pants in it
Send a box to ya papa with a hundred grand in it
He came back in the north he fill with them PT’s in it
That gucci gas man you ain’t gon have a seed in it
That gucci gas man you ain’t gon have a seed in it
I’m sittin’ on top of Bentley you know I’m sippin’ (sippin’, sippin’, sippin’)
Pour some lean on her titties now they sticky (sticky, sticky, sticky)

Riding Dirty man they said that I had 9 Birdies, 9 Birdies
Man they tryna’ catch me Riding Dirty, Riding Dirty
Got 2 guns you know I’m Riding Dirty
Riding Dirty, Riding Dirty, nigga Riding Dirty
Riding Dirty, man them folks so I sent nine birdies
Nine birdies, thats the verdict nigga, nine birdies, nine birdies nigga
Man I got this dirty 30, dirty pistol, I’m a motherfuckin’ dirty nigga
Dirty nigga I spent like 80 thousand for Bart Simpson
I was tripping’ then I went and spent a whole million
Whole million yeah I got a whole buncha green bills
Got a fork and I got them bands in them1Embed
