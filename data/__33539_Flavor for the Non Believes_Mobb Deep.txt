11 ContributorsFlavor for the Non Believes Lyrics
Yo

This is flavor for the non believes
Sit back, take a seat, and don't forget to pass the weed
And by the way, this is all the way live
And the way that I survive is pumpin' nickels and dimes
Pumpin' rocks on the corner, pumpin' rocks 'cause I wanna
The little Don Ho drug dealer, plus performer
At my height, I'm described as a midget
But it ain't about height, it's about, "Can I Kick It?"
Some say I'm too little, but yo, I'm too ill
I hit skins, light up, and then I smoke a Phil'
You don't wanna beef with this juvenile delinquent
I'm not good, I'm livin' like a hood
And when I kick, MC's abandon ship
'Cause my brain is the sun of a solar eclipse
Yo, Havoc is the man that you have to bring
'Cause I'm flippin' like pages in a Word Up! Magazine
Sweet like candy, the poetic vigilante
So explicit, even porno flicks ban me
And girls gel me like Jheri curl activate
The forty dog drinkin', money grip, you're dead and stinkin'
Brain cells overload when I'm thinkin'
This is a rap rape and I leave a fat taste
Get off the microphone, kid, stay in a child's place
I cook you up like Uptown raw base
And leave you open like if you just saw Scarface
Like I said it before, shorty scores
I get raw for the cause
Battle me, take a loss
I steal shows like Bell Biv DeVoe's
And put on my latex when I hit up the hoes
You know the flavor, kid, give me my props
'Cause it's 1992 and all the bullshit stops
You might also like
Check it, this is flavor for the non believes
This is flavor for the non believes
Check it, this is flavor for the non believes
This is flavor for the non believes

Mr. Soul, trunk jewels, sippin' Old Gold
Roll up my nickel pack of weed, lick it up, and stroll
Prodigy, verbally tragic and I'm toxic
Check out the way, check out the way, the way that I drop it
You know my style, step back 'cause I'm buckwild
All it takes is a mic, forty dog, and a smile
Baby Grand Puba, little Rick the Ruler
And in my pocket is a crazy fat bag of Buddha
MCs can't get with Mister Mister
Money don't fake moves 'cause I probably hit your sister
I'm on a mission, word is bond
Word to God, I goes on, the little Don
Smooth and fantastic as I get drastic
Shake your brain mentally and psychopathic
I murder with the brain of Hitler, black
And me bein' weak, even Kodak couldn't picture that

This is flavor for the
This is flavor for the non believes
Flavor for the non believes
This is flavor for the non believes
This is flavor for the non believes
Niggas don't understand, first of all
I rip when I rip, check it, never stall
Freestyle meanwhile for you and yours
I'm goin' all out, check it
You thought I couldn't, wish I wouldn't do what I did
I did it so I done, kill another fuckin' kid
'Cause I don't give a motherfuck
And you do, that's why your stupid ass got bucked
Out of luck, never took the time to wish
Took a bitch down, then I'm out like quick
Nestl√© chocolate, munch like it's buffet
That was then, this is now, I'm goin' for the gold
Thirty-yard touchdown, Mr. Short
Fuckin' niggas' bitches just for the sport
But not without the jimmy
'Cause bitches nowadays know magic tricks
And that I ain't with
Oh shit, time to move, time to move
Here we go with another fly groove, 'cause I'm so smooth
Never like to brag, but I do it still
Sip on a forty, smoke on the Phil'
So next time, kid, you wanna beef, just chill
Before I break your ass up to bits
How many licks would it take?
Check it out, one, two, three bitch-ass nigga lace
'Cause this is flavor for the non believes
This is flavor for the non believes
This is flavor for the non believes
This is flavor for the non believesEmbed
