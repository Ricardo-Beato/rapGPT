10 ContributorsMac 10 Lyrics
Ayy, I just had a conversation with my old hoe, ayy
She say she don't like me no more, ayy
'Cause I be getting dough
And too busy tourin', fuckin' on hoes
Pull up on my next bitch with my ex bitch
Pull up on your block, it's going down like Tetris
Pull up throwin' cash and shit at my old bitch wedding
Pull up on a opp like say hello to my Mac 10

Ayy, give a nigga ass a little 3 P, smoke and get head by Keke
She say she wanna be with me but I'm a roadrunner, meep meep
Fuckin' on all the thots, see who next on my freak sheet
Pullin' on all the opps, see who next on my heat sheet
30 bullets and 16 ounces in this pt, ayy
Put the money in the money counter, that bitch go fffff beep beep
And that bitch top so good, I swear that I went oghh, skeet skeet
Then I met the plug, pulled off with my drugs beep beep, ayy
Lucky I ain't rob his ass, ayy
Glo Gang can mob his ass, ayy
Knife on the AK then stab his ass, ayy ayy
Batman and Robbin his ass, ayy ayy
But he stay playin' games like he the Joker, ayy ayy
Send my young niggas through to smoke him, ayy ayy
Niggas steady talkin' 'bout drill, ayy ayy
Don't get killed over my mill's, ayy ayy
I'm off a pill, pipe in my wheel, ayy ayy
Pull on your ass, now sprite rockin' tilt, ayy ayy
That's why my bitch say she dont like me, ayy ayy
She say you always in the streets while I'm sleep, ayy ayy
Bitch you ain't my momma, bitch you ain't birth me, ayy
But answer this did I leave 30 G's in my jeans, ayy ayy
Niggas think we beef because of my tweet, ayy ayy
No, it's just red tape on your street, ayy ayy
No peach tree, she thought it was sweet, ayy ayy
Shouldn't be sneak dissin' bitches bout me, ayy ayy
You might also like
I just had a conversation with my old hoe, ayy
She say she don't like me no more, ayy
'Cause I be getting dough
And too busy tourin', fuckin' on hoes
Pull up on my next bitch with my ex bitch
Pull up on your block, it's going down like Tetris
Pull up throwin' cash and shit at my old bitch wedding
Pull up on a opp like say hello to my Mac 102Embed
