Niggas wanna win
These niggas wanna win
These niggas wanna win
Everybody wanna be a motherfuckin' winner
But that ain't how it work though, yeah

Ayy, ayy, disproportionate convictions
Especially when it come to our case
You seen the movie, they killed the nigga
Why you still wanna be like Scarface?
That's why niggas gon' lose (These niggas gon' lose)
Yeah (Ooh, yeah), I said it, niggas gon' lose (These niggas gon' lose, ooh-oh), yeah
And you can have a friend and you can have a Benz
One's sittin' down, the other's traffickin'
If you get the car, then your friend dies
Havin' one keeps the other one from happenin'
I hope a nigga don't lose (Ooh)
Fuck that car, nigga
Niggas gon' lose (Baby), uh-huh

And she want love, you only want sex
You got yours, she didn't get hers (Get hers)
She got no respect, y'all had a son (Oh)
She like, "Fuck you," she only want a check
That lil' nigga gon' lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Motherfucker, niggas gon' lose (Oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, and these rap niggas talkin' 'bout the hood
Like we all lames and they seen it
It's entertainin', it's cool as hell
And that beat dope, don't mean shit
That's why niggas gon' lose (Woah)
Fuck you talkin'? Niggas gon' lose (Yeah, yeah)
If they legalize that whole thing
They doin' weed, next cocaine (Cocaine)
Niggas ain't gon' have no jobs
And Wall Street gon' run the dope game (Woah-ooh)
What a nigga gon' do? (Ooh, yeah)
Huh? You niggas gon' lose (Ooh, oh)
You might also like
And when you see me, you don't see yourself
So I ain't got no problem shootin' me (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Willie Lynch set the shit up beautifully
One of the reasons niggas ain't got unity
That's why niggas gon' lose (You niggas gon' lose, oh, yeah)
Ayy, fuck that shit, ayy, niggas gon' lose, yeah (Oh-woah, yeah)
And most hood niggas is good niggas
In a heartbeat, I'll shed blood for him
But he too stupid, he won't sit down (Mm)
That nigga too hot, I got love for him (Woah)
That nigga gon' lose (Ah, yeah)
On my mama, that nigga gon' lose (Ah), yeah
And you did it 'cause your daddy did it
But he locked up in there and ain't happy with it (Oh, yeah)
With the same thing, get the same results
If your brain work (You know) then what's the matter with it?
You knew you was gon' lose (Ah, yeah)
They told you, nigga, you was gon' lose, yeah, yeah, yeah (Uh)

I never met a saint, from no color
From nowhere, from no other
From no castle, from no gutter
It ain't nobody that don't suffer
Some niggas gon' lose (Niggas gon' lose, ooh-ooh)
Some niggas gon' lose, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ah, yeah)
Promised land, I don't believe that
Had a dream and I don't need that
Please God, send us some jobs
'Cause my niggas really really need that
Or niggas gon' lose
That's right, niggas gon' lose (Ah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
And we sell dope then we turn around
And give the white people all our profits (Oh)
Take a percentage of that, set it to the side
And send these lil' niggas off to college (Oh)
So niggas don't lose (Yeah, yeah)
Niggas don't lose, uh, yeah (Oh-oh)
And if they offer somethin', just take it
Then work hard, don't waste it (Waste it)
Every castle started at the basement (Basement)
Yeah, your manager a racist
But you the ones that's gon' lose (Lose)
That's right, niggas gon' lose (Lose)
And these niggas gon' lose, oh-woah
I said, I said everybody wanna be a winner
Everybody wanna be a winner
Be a motherfuckin' winner, never gotta worry 'bout nothin'
But some niggas gon' lose
And it's fucked up (Yeah, yeah), so niggas don't lose
Ayy, you wake up 'cause you hear shots
Mean another nigga got his teardrops
And you call his phone, it ain't pickin' up
And your stomach hurtin', that fear drops
I hope a nigga ain't lose1Embed
