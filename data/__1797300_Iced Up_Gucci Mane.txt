12 ContributorsIced Up Lyrics
I pull up to club valet park my coupe
I'm lookin on the ground kuz I lost my damn roof
I can sit real high but I'm squatin real low
In a 07' lambo, same color smoke
Yo girl in my ride,can ya drive a stick
10 grand in my pocket like I sold a half a brick
Red monkeys on my ass,gucci's on my face
Pradas on my feet,on my wrist i got that Jac
Don't ya like my chain don't ya like my grill
Ain't I fresh ain't I fly baby girl just keep it real
Wit my paint like snot wit them green booger guts
I blow my nose wit hunneds I don' give a flyin fuck
Walked through the club showed love to the DJ
Left, went home and made it rain on the freeway
Gucci mane la flare AKA zone 6 shawty
Hunned pack of pills turned the club into a block party

I'm a roll me a blunt, Pour me a cup
Pull up to the club lift both doors up
Gucci so iced up, Gucci so iced up
I'm a roll me a blunt, Pour me a cup
Pull up to the club lift both doors up
Suga Suga so iced up, Suga Suga so iced up

Everything's new, fresh out of the wrapper
Pull fresh out off of the lot wit them thangs in a wrapper
Hold on, Push button doors go up at the same time
Kush burnin, now i'm flushin know its game time
I'm ridin down campbellton wit both doors up
Perssae in the changer wit the dro rolled up
Spent 10 thousand in a day thats off a blunt in a row
200 thousand in a safe I bout to stunt on a hoe
She like don't leave me, bitch you better get you a passport
Believe me, hoe we carry straps like the task force
Its easy practice like you takin' a crash course
You down to yo final hour you makin' yo last choice
I pull up to the club smokin' on a kush pack
I walk off in the front and get the whole line pushed back
Give ya boy a chance get yo whole life fucked up
Do it with no hands now i'm so fuckin iced up

I'm a roll me a blunt, Pour me a cup
Pull up to the club lift both doors up
Gucci so iced up, Gucci so iced up
I'm a roll me a blunt, Pour me a cup
Pull up to the club lift both doors up
Suga Suga so iced up, Suga Suga so iced up
(Work In Progress)
Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Maseratis and 'Vettes
 big coupes that ain't came out yet
Gucci , Gucci great, Gucci talk Gucci Mane
Run down  street  switchin' lanes
In a five star hotel right by Lenox
Give 'em 500 dollars for 15 minutes
Two iced out chains, in a brand new Range
Give the valet a 100 told him 'keep the change'
When I walk through the mall, hoes toke my bags
Just take it to the counter don't shake the tag
Quarter pound of bubble kush bought it to smoke
Mix it with that purple threats call it the 
Get 
 do it with no hands
Suga Suga, Gucci Mane in my drop top 'Vette and I'm drivin' with no hands

I'm a roll me a blunt, Pour me a cup
Pull up to the club lift both doors up
Gucci so iced up, Gucci so iced up
I'm a roll me a blunt, Pour me a cup
Pull up to the club lift both doors up
Suga Suga so iced up, Suga Suga so iced upEmbed
