In-inhale, in-inhale
In-inhale, in-inhale

I breathe deep like an old man in a deep sleep
Or Indian peace pipe in a tepee
The beginning, the end; the first, the last
Breath into eternity the verse will last
Got a chick in the south that be cursing fast
When it was a drought, I knew the thirst would last
Hunger of a homeless, microphoners
Played the game and got a bonus, man cause the plan is
To master like Tiger, so much drive
I am the definition of a rider
Daughter's name means 'survivor', from a tribe of
Colliders, just one word can't describe her
A scribe of the streets, and a good life that we all want to reach
I'm hotter than a beach
Flow is so deep, even underwater
I can inhale to put the world in order

In-inhale, in-inhale
In-inhale, in-inhale
You might also like
Gasping for air, and everlast
Still raps that are rare, I write with Christ
Passion to stair-way to Heaven is to stay in step
Breath is deep like my man Johnny Depp
You never know the next one God could have kept
So I find it hard to accept
I came from a gang, now I'm a star with a rep
Just to get-- by, 'cause I was slept on like a red-eye
Like Rastafara, I knew to keep my head high
Blessed by the father, son of the author of life
So rap became my wife
Like love at first sight or a thug in his first fight
It's all new, so you got to feel your way through
Until you break through, it might take two
Inhale deep to inflict too, it's great to
Breathe

In-inhale, in-inhale
