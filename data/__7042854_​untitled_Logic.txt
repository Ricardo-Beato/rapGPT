Yeah
Yeah, just keep it going, man
You good (Here we go)
We all going to come in together like this, here we go

Ayy, yo
Rapping just to rap, what the fuck happened to that?
Mainstream took a hold of my soul, but I made it back
Bringin' it back to the roots on some Dat's Dat
I've rhymed for the love of it, this right here is my covenant
Since I was a youngin' eatin' cheese from the government
Come on now, no matter where you at up in the world we on now
Me and my dogs do it different, yеah, that's on the pound
If you want to know what we on right now listen to thе sound
Uh, listen to the sound
I said I've paid my dues and stayed cool since grade school
Yeah, you know we bringin' that heat like AU
Back in the day in G'Burg I was wonderin' wagwan
Tryna make it out I was a fish in a small pond
My word is bond, we had somethin' going on
I played all the parties and sang the la-di-da-dis
I've picked up the mic and serenaded the hotties
I drove the Impalas with cats that's had bodies
I hit the studio, you know I left the track bodied
I do this shit right here for me, myself, and nobody
Me and my family rollin' deep like Gotti
Word to John, oh, you know we got it going on
I'm a silver tongue motherfucker, but it never gone
It goes on and on and on and on and on
In the studio 'til like five in the mornin'
Rappin 'til the sun comes up and it's the dawn
While my homies smokin' more grass than acres on my lawn
Put on your good clothes, it's showtime at the Apollo
Shut the fuck up and get to the point like a hollow
I need the microphone like thirsty bitches need the follow
I get the pussy wetter than mahalo-halo, ho!
Aw yeah, you know I'm going beast mode
These other rappers kiddin' themselves, in vitro
It's no contest, steppin' to me it's time to rest
I'm beyond blessed, greatest MC put it to rest for a yearYou might also like7Embed
