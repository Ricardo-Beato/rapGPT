(Yo, Pi'erre, yo, Pi'erre)
In my triple cup, that's two times two
Man, this shit darker than a wonton soup, ayy
Yeah, my eyes red, but I'm no Damu
If you don't run it up, that's all on you

You know I'm ballin', usual like Kobe (24)
Ooh, worried 'bout a hater that don't know me
He say that he tough, then that boy gotta show me
Pull up Bentley truck, extra poles, and we four deep (Bah)
Say my name three times like I'm Tony (Tony, Toni, Toné)
Diamond VVS, I put baguettes all on my Rollie
I ain't never believe nothing that you told me
These niggas keep sneak dissing, they turned me to my old me
Before I had these mils, I was oh-so lonely
Runnin' 'round in Philadelphia only with my 40
I ain't never been a phony (No way)
You be gettin' bands? Hardly, yeah
I just fucked your bitch, sorry, oh (I'm sorry)
Man, I put that on my shawty, ooh
Fight me, we're not scared, sorry (I'm sorry)
No, I'm not here for no games, Atari (No way)
Diamonds, they hittin' like water, ooh, starbeam, yeah
Rockstar life be callin' (Callin', yeah)
Don't want that girl, she stallin', she stallin' (Oh, oh)
Big ol' foreign whip, ooh, I can't park it (Ooh, no way)
I'm from outer space, ooh, in a starship (Ooh)
Thick ol' foreign bitch, ooh, that's my target (Ooh)
Ten bands, what you say? Ooh (Ooh)
Ten bands for my Chanel carpet (Alright)
Rockstar life like watch this (Okay)
Young nigga slick like margarine (Huh?)
Lost your bitch in Starlet's (Jeez)

The bitch staring at me
Got real big titties (Sos', baby)
What's in my jeans? (Huh?)
Them real big fifties
Flight after flight (Beep)
Hittin' real big cities
From the sandbox, yeah, my brothers is with me (Mhm)
If they give me a bond, I'm comin' to get me (Let's get it)
And in the club (Let's get it)
We snuck the semi (Bang)
Cup, dawg, it ain't Rémy
I can feel the envy
In my triple cup, that's two times two
Man, this shit darker than a wonton soup, ayy
Yeah, my eyes red, but I'm no Damu
If you don't run it up, that's all on you
Disrespect the gang, and we stall on you, hey
Send them Trackhawk shots, don't get called on you (Bang, bang)
Bring my belt, better have that coat on you, ayy (Gang, gang)
Marry that guap, you know I do
