14 ContributorsMotivation Lyrics
Well, Darnell Boat here
And it seems like we've come to an end
It's been a long four years, lotta ups, and a lotta downs
But I just want you to know, Boat
I'm so, so proud of you
And of course, I'm proud of you too, Yachty, you know that
Both of y'all have put on a lot of pounds
But you've made a lot of money
Surprised me, actually, surprised us all
Now, I know what those people have been sayin'
And what they've said, but you know I know you both
Before all of this, you guys are still the same
Don't let any of this cloud your mind
You are who you are (Uh), because of who you are

Rather stay around with that MAC-10
Tired of breakinâ€™ my back for those who won't bend
This bitch gon' fuck when the racks spend
Pullin' up with my pack and my brothers with me
Cameras rollin', I see how you actin'
You be cappin'
Niggas ain't on my side, and I know
They want me to fail and I know
Niggas playin', bangin', they G on my soul
Mm-mm, we done made it too far to go back now
We done made all of these stacks, look at plaques now
Beat all on her back, she get tired
Only get excited for a wire, twenty thousand dollars for my tires
They thought I was expired, that shit had me inspired
You might also like
Mm-hm, I can tell niggas need some motivation
I'ma be the face of the new nation
Gimme my paper like a citation
(Gimme my muhfuckin' credit, my respect, all that shit)
Closet lookin' like the salvation
You ain't rich yet 'cause you be impatient
I ain't done yet, I ain't complacent
Need a hunnid spots like a Dalmatian
Crib in every state, that's the real goal

She gon' eat it hot like a egg roll
And I think she mixed like a Oreo
And she look young but she forty-four
She gon' go dumb when that door close
Suckin' on her thumb, know she want more
Get all in her gums on the GoPro
(And that, you feel me, windows tinted, you feel me)
I cannot lie to you, dawg
I'm up in the sky with you, dawg
RIP Juice WRLD, that was my dawg
(R-I-P my mothafuckin' brotha, these lame ass niggas suck, man
These niggas need some help)

Mm-hm, I can tell niggas need some motivation
I'ma be the face of the new nation
Gimme my paper like a citation
(Gimme my muhfuckin' bills, man, for real, I deserve it)
Closet lookin' like the salvation (Yeah)
You ain't rich yet 'cause you be impatient
I ain't done yet, I ain't complacent
Crib in every state, that's the real goal
She want me to kiss on her pussyhole
I got twenty racks sayin' you can make it out, dawg
I got twenty racks sayin' you can make it out, dawg
Without no help
Believe in yourself
(You don't need a muhfuckin' handout in this muhfucka)
Model bitches flyin' over me right now
My newest bitch badder than a racist
Short hair with brown skin like a Reese's
I'ma nut in her till my sister got nieces
Can't figure out where I wanna stay
Only reason why I keep doin' leases

Mm-hm, I can tell niggas need some motivation
I'ma be the face of the new nation
Gimme my paper like a citation
(Need my cut and respect like I ain't been doin' what I'm talkin' 'bout)
Closet lookin' like the salvation (Come on)
You ain't rich yet 'cause you be impatient
I ain't done yet, I ain't complacent
Need a hunnid spots like a Dalmatian

Whole gang hit, she a train station
Tryna cuff me but I can't go
