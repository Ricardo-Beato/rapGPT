11 ContributorsLove Somebody Lyrics
If you need somebody say "Yeah yeah"
And if she love somebody, say "Hell yeah"

I can't even lie, baby girl you super cool
And I got a crush on you just like first day of school
Every time I bought some shoes, I bought your ass some shoes
Every time I bought some Trues, you got a pair of Trues
And you left me by myself, now girl I'm so confused
Tell me why you do the things, you do the things you do
I like the way you walking when you walk, the way you move
Ain't no secret 'bout it baby, that's what made me choose
One girl ain't enough for me but fuck that shit, I'm straightenin' up
Them bitches know shit 'bout me, them hoes just wanna break us up
Come on girl, let's fall in love cause I'm so tired of being tough
This might be beginners luck and I don't wanna fuck it up
I'mma get your hair fixed baby just so I can mess it up
Grab that skirt when you get off of work so we can dress it up
I'mma be here thick and thin and God gon' keep on testing us
I said I wouldn't do it again but I just keep on messin' up

If you need somebody, say "Yeah yeah"
And if she love somebody, say "Hell yeah"
If you got somebody, say "Yeah yeah"
But if you love that nigga, say "Hell yeah"
I wanna know, I wanna know if you gonna say "Yeah yeah"
I wanna know, I wanna know, if you love me, say "hell yeah"
I wanna know, I need to know, if you need me, say "Hell yeah"
But if you really love that bitch, say "Hell yeah"

Firs time, I love you
I trust you, I'll fuck you all night, yeah
I'll treat your body right, yeah
Buy you black diamonds, no night
Have you ever had your name on the seat belts of your flight, yeah?
Cause that bitch belong to you
Motherfuck who think they king, baby girl I'm throning you
Lil tomboy ass cologne for you
And I ain't never ever had a girl like you
I know what to do with a girl like you
That's why I just had a little girl for you
You're perfect, I might leave Thug's world for you
And I can't wait 'til I get home
So you can only do it with that dome, ooh
And I can't wait to get in the house
Cause I'm gonna eat that pizza on the couch, ooh
And I can't wait to get upstairs
Cause I'mma put your legs in the air, yeah
And I can't wait 'til we get done
Cause I'mma beat the pussy in the morning

If you need somebody, say "Yeah yeah"
And if she love somebody, say "Hell yeah"
If you got somebody, say "Yeah yeah"
But if you love that nigga, say "Hell yeah"
I wanna know, I wanna know if you gonna say "Yeah yeah"
I wanna know, I wanna know, if you love me, say "hell yeah"
I wanna know, I need to know, if you need me, say "Hell yeah"
But if you really love that bitch, say "Hell yeah"9Embed
