Ooh, this for my bad bitches cross the country
You know it's about that time right?
Time to pop it nasty!

The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies (babies)
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies
Pop that, pop it, pop that, pop it, pop that, pop that booty (Pop it nasty!)
Pop that, pop that, pop that, pop that, pop that booty
Bow, pop it, bow, pop it, bow, pop it, pop that booty (Pop it nasty!)
Bow, bow, bow, bow pop that booty

Pop it! Oh! Pop it!
Quavo wanna see you pop it nasty (Go)
Lil mama so thick, look like Kim Kardashian (Mama)
But no I'm not wifing, young nigga passin'
She making it pop like the 4th of July
She know I got millions, ain't no need to lie (M&M's)
Tattoo on her booty is a butterfly (Brrrr)
I bet when she make it pop, it's gonna fly (Go)
Soda pop booty, she poppin' her booty like popcorn, and it's wobblin' (Oh)
Wanna take her home, wanna get in my room (Woo)
When I get the pussy, I'mma dive in it (Ooh!)
She make me wanna have a million babies, when she poppin' the booty, hop-scotchin' it (Uh!)
I reach in my pocket, I slap her on the ass, told her she better not stop poppin' it (Don't stop)
Everybody know that she a cutie (Oh)
You keep spendin' money, she make you foolish (Whoa)
But look at me, Young Quavo, I'mma do it (Do)
She poppin' it on me, she make me lose it (Do)
I ran out of cash, hit the ATM (ATM)
I'm livin' my life like the game of Sims (Sims)
She stomp the booty on me like some Timbs (Timbs)
End up leavin' the club around 6 AM

Freaky deeky, pussy drippin', leaky (Freaky deeky)
White girls, I got jungle fever (White girls)
Her booty jumpin', every beat out the speaker (Jump)
Hit her one time, then I leave her, delete her (Smash)
'Round and round, jump up and down like a pogo (Boing, boing!)
IPhone my camera, we might make a porno (Porno)
I had to pipe her up, I gave her a makeover
Private jet to LA, we don't do layovers
Ooo, Oh, piercings in her nipples, piercings in her dimples
Pop it like a pimple (Rahh, eew)
She nasty, bet you didn't know her daddy a pastor, laughter (Hahaha)
She in my traphouse, she poppin' the castle (Whoa)
Speed it up, then she go slow
Poppin' that pussy, do the tootsie roll (Roll)
She go harder than the concrete (Hard)
Italian tailor, Givenchy
Money longer than a bungee (Uh!)
All this damn gold like a treasury (Gold)
Lick on me like I am licorice (Slurp)
Birkin bag, she's an expensive bitch (Expensive bitch)
She ratchet, she still got the kinky twist (Ratchet)
Pop it, pop it, in my Bentley, bitch (Oh, uh!)
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies (babies)
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies

Bow, pop it, bow, pop it, bow, pop it, pop that booty (Pop it nasty!)
Bow, bow, bow, bow pop that booty

The way that she shakin' it, I might be taking it
Breaking it, but no relationship (Nah)
Big ole booty, no big booty Judy
Her pussy wet when she get on that percocet (Wet)
She looked at my hand, saw it full of bands
Told that lil bitty bitch pop that (Pop that)
I'm throwin' cash, cash, all a nigga see is ass
It must be an ass attack (Ass attack)
Do you want some of these old hundreds, baby?
I'm talkin' older than Thundercats (Oh)
She shakin' it, she know her ass fat
It got me thinkin' 'bout where is her momma at?
All the bitches starin' at you in the club
'Cause they know that you be poppin' that (Poppin' that)
She breakin' it, makin' the club shake
She done gave the old man a heart attack (Dang)
She shakin' like Shakira, look in the mirror (Mirror)
No ass shots, her booty real
She poppin' it, nigga, no Activis seal (Dang)
Bad bitches tell me how you feel (Bad)
All my rich niggas stand in the mirror
Mirror, mirror, it's a million here
Migo chain lookin' like chandeliers (Migo)
Shakin' that ass like it's fast and furious
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies (babies)
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies
