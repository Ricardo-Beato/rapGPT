Oh you want that bitch?
You can't have that bitch
She got habits man
She been around rich nigga too long
Sosa!

Why hoes be callin' my phone?
Cause hoes just wanna have fun
I be ridin' round with the chrome
Try me then I put one in yo dome
I pump it like
Guess what boy 
I got one up in the head, guess what boy

Yous a little ass boy, little ass shoes
Little ass house, little ass jewels
Little ass you, little ass tool
Little ass bullets, little ass shooter
I pull up with the stick, then I play some pool
I just got a pool, your ho invited too
I don't how I'm afford that, I know I'm so cool
I ain't go to school, I ain't know the rules
Pull up on me try to score, gonna front your move
Better be a badass cutie, I'm on you like a s'more
Ridin' with my nina, I ain't go to war
And I got a subpoena, I ain't go to court

Why hoes be callin' my phone?
Cause hoes just wanna have fun
I be ridin' round with the chrome
Try me then I put one in yo dome
I pump it like
Guess what boy 
I got one up in the head, guess what boy

Pull up on your ass and get you boy
Walkin' out the bank I laugh funny boy
When I pull up it's a tragic boy
It's a silencer and a gun
That's me pullin' off in traffic boy
Bling, bling, that's the magic in my necklace boy
Bang, bang, that's the crank up in my ratchet boy
Ding, ding, that's your thot up in my mansion door
Ping, ping, that's the money callin' me boy
Beep, beep, that's me pullin' off with 10 boy
Skeet, skeet, cause that bitch top terrific boy
Eat, eat, when they see how I'm livin' boy

Why hoes be callin' my phone?
Cause hoes just wanna have fun
I be ridin' round with the chrome
Try me then I put one in yo dome
I pump it like
Guess what boy 
I got one up in the head, guess what boy4Embed
