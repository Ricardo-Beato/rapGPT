4 ContributorsFly Away Lyrics
(Fallen Angel on the track)
Yeah
Back at it again
Neighborhood Nip'
Omar Cruz
Westside 
What up, Bayside?

If you ask around my city
This is what they'll tell you about me
I'm a boss, yeah
I'm all about my paper, bitch, you better have my cheese
It's cheesy, I'm a boss, boss

Big boy toys, young nigga balling
Hang up in the face, lil' mama keep calling
Wanna play the game, but I go way harder
If I take away the pussy, it's another lame off
And I'm a real one, so I ain't gotta soak up
But I'm a Rolex rocker, your boy G Shocked up
One thing about them niggas, they is not us
Poly your spots, my women swimming topless
And I don't do too much clubbin'
I'm busy doing everything your last nigga couldn't
I'm flying 'round the country, spendin' money like it's nothing
And every time I land, my driver picking up the luggage
We on, yeah
Yeah, we on
We taking trips, lil' mama, said, then we on
Take one with us
Everyday we on
It's to the west, Jersey to L.A., you know, yeah
You might also like
If you ask around my city
This is what they'll tell you about me
I'm a boss, yeah
I'm all about my paper, bitch, you better have my cheese
It's cheesy, I'm a boss, boss

My wrist on glissin', dodging head  (Uh)
Get on the whip, make it look like I'm Rider Low (Yeah)
Cocaine T chain with a lotta gold
Go in and go hard, like Geronimo
Chrome ryms, what I spent had a lotta dough
But when they spin, hoes grin, met a lotta hoes
And a lot of yo's didn't wanna ride with us
See I done made it big, I call it my lotto ho
Pick a number, 'cause you gon' wait in line for O
You ain't ready for the cherry 
Get inside with O, I told you a while ago
Pulling up, riding slow
Beep beep, gotta go
And you ain't even gotta pack no bags
Hit the first mall we see, soon as we land
Don't forget your plans, no need for hesatation
L.A.X. bound, you pick destonation
If you ask around my city
This is what they'll tell you about me
I'm a boss, yeah
I'm all about my paper, bitch, you better have my cheese
It's cheesy, I'm a boss, boss

What's the deal, baby girl? You the one I like
And if I ever go crazy, you're the one I'd wife
Gotta phone, let me call, got a place we could ball
We can meet up at the mall, fuck it, go and spend it all
I'm a cirtified gas shorty, off the leash
 one way ticket, coming off the streets
Now push off your heels, let me rub those feet
And you better finish that, 'cause this rub ain't cheep
I'm as slick as the  mixed together
When the snow starts coming, we can fix the weather
Gotta live it for the moment, no one lives forever
Your body, my place, nothing fits it better
Your boy styled up, freshed out, 
Tall ryms, new tims, with a 
We can do what you wanna do, tell me to go
Fast lane, had to know it's slow

If you ask around my city
This is what they'll tell you about me
I'm a boss, yeah
I'm all about my paper, bitch, you better have my cheese
It's cheesy, I'm a boss, bossEmbed
