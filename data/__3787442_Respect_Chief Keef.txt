Respect a real nigga

It's all about the respect
And if you ain't got the respect
We come through blamin' with Tecs, nigga

I got the weed and the snacks
I got the cash and the racks
I got the bitches and bags
Respect with the Tec
I got this Tec to your neck
Respect with Uzi and net
Fuck around get your ass wet
You might also like
Respect

I'm shaking
Got you
I know my car got the flu
But it still would get you

Respect a real nigga
Respect a real nigga
Ayy, respect a real nigga
Respect a real nigga
Ayy, if you don't respect a real nigga
You 'bout get killed, nigga
So respect a real nigga

It's all about the respect
And if you ain't got the respect
We come through blamin' with Tecs, nigga
Came through with the AK and the saw
You a real nigga, knock off nigga
Fuck nigga, knock it off
Got my driver doin' drop-offs, nigga
Come and get your bitch cus' I'm going soft

Why I'm all alone going off
Hopped out with the guns and the foreigns and the bloods so we come through, swormin' nigga
And we Glo Navy
Pussy nigga, fuck your army nigga
Get mixed in the blender with the fruit 'cause the shit here don't involve you nigga
They get that call from So Obama then Yosama, nigga

Ayy, respect a real nigga
Respect a real nigga
Ayy, if you don't respect a real nigga

And if you ain't got the respect
We come through blamin' with Tecs, niggaEmbed
