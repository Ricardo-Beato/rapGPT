12 ContributorsI Fawk With That Lyrics
You know I fuck with her
You know she fuck with me
You know she stuck with me
It's Gucci Mane she gotta be
A dime piece
Look at my time piece
A big bag of kush what she remind me
I'm on the slick-talking shit, like the Isleys
You got to spend 400,000 to ride behind me
You got to pay 15k just to sit beside me
I'm on the grind, I ain't even got to go outside before you see me shine
Real niggas want to get me fired
Cutie pie wanna come and say hi
Player haters want to see die but it can't stop me, nigga I'm alive
.45 shoot 13 times
AK's yetta don't take lies
And your main girl on my line
Nigga, I swear I ain't never seen a bitch so fine

She got her own cash, I fawk with that
I fawk with that, I fuck with that
She got a full swag, I fawk with that
I fawk with that, I fawk with that
Turnt up to the max, I fawk with that
I fawk with that, I fawk with that
She only fuck with street niggas, I fawk with that
I fawk with that, you know I fawk with that

The bitch I’m with she so fly she need a fucking flight attendant
If I said that shit, I meant that shit
Ten million dollars cash, I done spent that shit
If you love that chick, don’t send that bitch
Don’t lend that bitch, I hit that bitch
Break that bitch and bend that bitch
Don’t follow my rules I end this shit
Sipping on Bombay, what would your mom say?
Let’s not pretend ’cause I’m not your fiancé
Met on a Sunday, fuck on a Monday
Girl you ain’t heard I’m in love with that money
Keep it a hundred keeping you running
Turn your ass round and you lay on your stomach
Cuffin no woman, keep it from coming
Keep it I’m coming. I’m brutally honest
All in the AT, all in Atlant
Pulling her Tracs while she’s scratching my back
Leaning in forward, she pushing me back
Bad at commitment but great in the sack
Gave her a stack, baby relax
Way that she sucking, it's paying me back
Dick is a horse so I’m fucking with that
Roses are red, Ferraris are black
