Well my name is Latifah (yeah)
Well my name is Latifah (yeah)
Well my name is Latifah (yeah)
Well my name is Latifah

I am a bill, yes, I'm only a bill
(Yo yo yo, La, chill
The Nature wanna hear some of that
Up-to-date, New Swing stuff)
Aight, I got you, here we go
One more time
(Kick it)

To all the coons, I say hi-de-ho
Produced by the mighty pro
Crazy Kay Gee kickin' hits like Karate Joe
Always with the mind every time to
Blame it on the Whitey so
See just Black and White?
There's no room for that in the '90s, yo
I'm still a bill and still checkin' mics, one-two
A whole year later, made you wait 'til the album's through
So many controversies over the language in rap
It wasn't a cuss that started a fuss
Now that's just a Black thing
Figure of speech is one thing
But enough of those reruns
Callin' sisters this and tricks
You gotta be one to see one
And sisters, brothers ain't all to blame, this may help
'Cause no respect is given to those who cannot respect self, see?
The queen has spoken
Yeah, I'm yokin', my head is hot
My style is like me shootin' hoops
Yeah, I better drop
For the last time, it's rag time I go for mine
I was leanin' towards a reason
To get you steamin' one more time

I'm the Q-U-E-E-N, L-A-T-I-F-A-H, yeah

A little taste from a bird's eye view
Of all the styles I might do
Don't have it down to a "tee"
I have it down to a Q
U know the E-E-N is close friends
So they come too
You ever step in the way?
You get stepped on and stepped through
The Flavor Unit's come and then we must make room
For all the flavor's here
This is one of my all-time flavor-ite tunes
Dissin' the Latifah? What this for?
You'd better off rammin' your head against a brick wall, Seagal
Time to rag that asset from corner to cassette
Chumps come try to trash it and see how far that gets
On the rhymin' tip, I ain't no joke
Singin' tip? Golden throat!
I hold a note so long, here's a ransom note
Prepare for war the worst who's first sharin' a
Glock, lick shot from Africa, bust 'em at America!
I never bite my tongue
This is what some long nights have done
Bitin', to me, don't even sound like it might be fun
Start with a change of heart and save all that sorry, child
I'm like P.E., I get bold, buckwild, safari style
For the last time, it's ragtime I go for mine
I was leanin' towards a reason
To get you steamin' one more time
One more time
I'm the Q-U-E-E-N, L-A-T-I-F-A-H, yeah

Put a freeze on your jolly raps
I ain't a dizzy dolly that
Takes a line and splatterin'
No happenin' when it's probably wack
Don't approach the queen like she's a skeeze
'Cause I am way past that
Makin' my own, savin' my own
Is why y'all always find me stacked
Keepin' my cool, speakin' my mind
And givin' it all I got, alright?
Bustin' buffoons, peekin' to find
Who's goin' left and playin' right
Lovin' my crew, bringin' 'em up
Leadin' 'em all to somethin' great
Want to be sure
One may not have
But since I'm strong
My clique is straight
And I could never go out like an exit
'Cause my fans stick behind me
And they wouldn't expect it
I'm level-headed, head-to-head
I'm headed straight to Harlem
Though I'm not dreaded, dread the dred
If they're not there, you call 'em
I need my brothers and sisters
With me, standing hand to hand
Band to band, we're off land to land and
Buyin' much property, properly, pronto, please
That's the only way a Black business starts, you see
Name callin' hasn't fallen into what I'm runnin'
I wouldn't diss another sister 'less she had it comin'
One time, I'm chill when I sing it
You think that you can swing it? Then bring it
