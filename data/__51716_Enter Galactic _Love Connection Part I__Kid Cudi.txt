Okay
You say you never done this before
And that's cool and all
But I want you to try this with me
That's cool
Don't worry

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

I once used to dream of peace until I found you
Once upon a time baby
I once used to dream so sweet until I had a taste of you
Once upon a time baby
Reachin' out to outer space, dancin' to awesome sounds
This all new to you
I'm reachin' out to hold you close so I don't slip away
Explore a new approach, a whole new free I'd say
You might also like
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

I know it's easy to imagine
But it's easier to just do
See, if you can't do what you imagine
Then what is imagination to you?
Just a waste of space in your brain
To take the place of hate or things all the same
Tell me your secrets, the things that make you tick
I like when you talk, because your voice is angelesque
Ay, I want to kiss you on your space below your navel at
The place that you keep neat, so moist, like a towelette
This will mark the day our minds and souls will connect
Let's not forget the sex, my heart you can collect, now, now
My heart you can collect, now, now
My heart you can collect, now, now
Have just one more cap, babe, babe, babe
Have just one more stem, babe
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

Pop it, ready, go
Let it, take, take, take, take over
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Get ready, let, let, it take you over
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Take it, just let it, take, take, you over
Get ready, let's go, let's go, hey

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Soon after falling into a deeper psychedelic state
To escape the prison of our reality
Our hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place
Which immediately becomes his sanctuary
A place filled with his wildest dreams
This is his new home31Embed
