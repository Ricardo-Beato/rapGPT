Baby I don’t mean to stare cause yo nigga right there
I suggest you fuck with me cause baby I’m a bigger player
If yo man is a square then you shouldn’t fuck with squares
I suggest you call yo girl cause I fuck bitches by the pair
From the bed to the couch, fucking all over the house
If yo man don’t pay yo rent then I suggest you put him out
I suggest you invest in a nigga with some clout
I suggest that you put a rich nigga off in yo mouth
You know I’m ice cold
Ice cold 

I’m so cold when it comes to hoes
Think my heart is made of coal
If you ask my mama though, she’ll say my heart is made of gold
But my Rollie made of gold and my heart been turned to stone
And my boss a rolling stone and where he lay his head home
Baby girl I’m freezing, take me out the freezer
If you don’t believe me I can make you a believer
My motor had a heart attack, my truck, it had a seizure
All this gold around my neck, they think I come from Egypt
Gucci Mane got stupid grown so you can fire that weed up
Go on and call yo hairdresser cause I’ma fuck yo weave up
Diamond rings all on my fingers, I look like a preacher
Losers keepers, you can keep her, I just wanna freak her
You might also like
Baby I don’t mean to stare cause yo nigga right there
I suggest you fuck with me cause baby I’m a bigger player
If yo man is a square then you shouldn’t fuck with squares
I suggest you call yo girl cause I fuck bitches by the pair
From the bed to the couch, fucking all over the house
If yo man don’t pay yo rent then I suggest you put him out
I suggest you invest in a nigga with some clout
I suggest that you put a rich nigga off in yo mouth
You know I’m ice cold
Ice cold 

Coldhearted, I got mo' money than a gold artist
They say rapping make you money, I keep buying mo' 'raris
Strangers talk when they walk by me then they say sorry
And if a nigga touch me, shut down the whole damn party
Drinking Rosé out the bottle, like a ice cold vodka
They say you bought her the D but you just start balling
I used to run up on the scene but I got no degree, shawty
Niggas don’t gotta fuck with me long as these bitches keep calling
I’m a stone cold killer, load my shot Glock 40
You got a problem 'fore you walk, don’t be no dead man walking
Tried to be a humble nigga but my bread started talking
Tried to tell my dogs to stop but them choppas start barking
I say what the fuck I wanna say like my nigga Charles Barkley
How you gon' play ball with niggas when you niggas not balling?
Tried to sneak me in the joint, had to stomp 'em to the floor
I ain’t goin' back no more cause it’s so ice cold in the hole
Baby I don’t mean to stare cause yo nigga right there
I suggest you fuck with me cause baby I’m a bigger player
If yo man is a square then you shouldn’t fuck with squares
I suggest you call yo girl cause I fuck bitches by the pair
From the bed to the couch, fucking all over the house
If yo man don’t pay yo rent then I suggest you put him out
I suggest you invest in a nigga with some clout
I suggest that you put a rich nigga off in yo mouth
You know I’m ice cold
