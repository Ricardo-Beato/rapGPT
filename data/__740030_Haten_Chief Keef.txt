14 ContributorsHaten Lyrics
Ayy, ayy (Ayy)
Bang (Sos', baby)
Gang
Lame (Bang)
Bang (Bang)
All of my bling on
Smoking on the strong (Sos', baby, Sos', baby)
My thing on
All of my bling on
My watch on
And my chain on
And my gwap on

All of my bling on
Smoking on the strong
They like, "Sosa where you been?" Huh
I've been getting money, you've been gone
Come back with my watch on
And my chain on
And my gwap on
Getting my boss on
They be hatin'
They be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin'
They be hatin'
They be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin'
Hatin'
Hatin', hatin', hatin', hatin'
Hatin'
Hatin', hatin', hatin', hatin'

Well I got money all up in my palms
Bitches all up in my phone
Niggas start to hatin', then stop participating
Then go'n get it, go'n get it on
I'm big from my chain to my arm
Pulled up flexin' on the low
'Member taking dope money back like, "Ayy, sir, I'm Shawn"
What the fuck you thought?
I had to go and get me some guap
I don't like no small
I had to go get me a large
These niggas come through going far
Me, I come through going hard
Something like MIMS
'Caue this is why I'm hot
Need some M and millions, I like chocolate
Pull up with no ceilings on, I think that I'm Wan'
I think that I'm Wayne, Big Tymers, blang blang

All of my bling on
Smoking on the strong
They like, "Sosa where you been?" Huh
I've been getting money, you've been gone
Come back with my watch on
And my chain on
And my gwap on
Getting my boss on
They be hatin'
They be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin'
They be hatin'
They be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin'
Hatin'
Hatin', hatin', hatin', hatin'
Hatin'
Hatin', hatin', hatin', hatin' (Sos', baby)
Pair of Air Force 1's, no socks
Remember having rocks in my socks
Bitch I got Margielas that I don't even wear
But I'ma put it on and get hot
All these fuck niggas jealous, they don't want me to kill it
They don't give a fuck if I flop
But I'ma keep on killin', I'm a keep Meek Mill-in'
I'm straight gon' chase that guap
Pull up smoking skunk to the skunk
Shawty got some junk in her trunk
And these niggas keep on hatin'
But I don't give a motherfucking fuck to the fuck
Sneak dissin' like what to the what
I'm like huh to the huh
I'm just getting money, that's it, homie, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
Ayy, 110 in a 55, now I'm running from the cops
She say that I got style, baby, I get that a lot
I get that a lot, I get that a lot

All of my bling on
Smoking on the strong
They like, "Sosa where you been?" Huh
I've been getting money, you've been gone
Come back with my watch on
And my chain on
And my gwap on
Getting my boss on
They be hatin'
They be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin'
They be hatin'
They be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin', they be hatin'
Hatin'
Hatin', hatin', hatin', hatin'
Hatin'
Hatin', hatin', hatin', hatin'4Embed
