18 Contributors8 Mile: D’Phuzion vs B-Rabbit Lyrics
Yo, B-Rabbit
This silly rabbit don’t like lettuce, I heard he like dicks
Faggot niggas, with ponytails and lipstick
I'm for real; don’t give a fuck, what
What, oh
It’s like this; east side is where I'm from
You got beef, hit me on the streets with a badge and a gun
Fuck the badge, I'm coming through with black mags
'Bout to do this B-Rabbit nigga 'cause he's a fag
Like I said earlier in the clause
I stated that in my— oh, shit

A'ight, look
I can see that I’m put to the test
Battling this chick...with no breasts
And why I gotta battle a chick?
Especially one that’s whack, wit' a dick?
So you a dope MC?
Don’t get mad, start taking your period out on me
‘Cause I ain’t done shit to you
What’s your name, Confusion? Well, then I guess I gotta confuse you
This ain’t something I’m used to
Why the fuck did Future even introduce you?
I really don’t understand
Why this chick is up here right now and wants to be a man
On this mic, it’s rat-a-tat-tat
Why the fuck am I standing here battling Da Brat?
You don’t really even wanna see this
On this microphone, I will eat your fucking fetus
