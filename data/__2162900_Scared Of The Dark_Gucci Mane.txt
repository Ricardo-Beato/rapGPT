16 ContributorsScared Of The Dark Lyrics
I think I'm scared of the dark, so I wear glasses at night
I think I'm scared of the dark, fuck all my hoes in the light
I said I'm scared of the dark that's why my diamonds soo bright
I think I'm scared of the dark, so haters, get out my sight
Because I'm scared of the dark

Fuck her with the lights on, fuck her with my ice on
Tokyo diamonds, thoin yoin in her loins
Sip goop, hit the joint
Can't wait to guwop out the joint
Sun roof back me and Mak' doin kung fu with the strap
Bruce Lee Roy need these M&Ms like I'm from Detroit
But who these niggas in the city thinkin' that they them boys
I smoke out, I po' up two L's above Beelzebub
Right next to the check cashin place
Citgo & the liquor store
Custer Ave, Barrio boys bust yo ass
Ay ask yo bitch, I fucked her mouth, and fucked her ass
Ay, wash my dick in sink, na nigga I ain't tryna link
I on't give a fuck 'bout your new tape
It's a party, I'm just tryna drink

I think I'm scared of the dark, so I wear glasses at night
I think I'm scared of the dark, fuck all my hoes in the light
I said I'm scared of the dark that's why my diamonds soo bright
I think I'm scared of the dark, so haters, get out my sight
Because I'm scared of the dark

Hopped out the Phantom, Coca-Cola Lambo
Last week Alabama, don't worry 'bout my trunk
Yup, my speakers Jackie Chain, um
Found my new wheels at the bottom of the Grand Canyon
Guwop and the rap Breezy, that's a nice Versace tandem
The fact that I ain't won a Grammy, yup I'm gettin' robbed
When Gucci Mane get out, I might sign with Bricksquad 1017
Part of triple beam, triple beam dreams
Checkin' the block like Hakeem, I can Scott Skiles
100K just for me to crack a smile
Aw shit, look who it is, it's the white Berry Smalls
Maybe show my swift, diamonds on my stick shift

I think I'm scared of the dark, so I wear glasses at night
I think I'm scared of the dark, fuck all my hoes in the light
I said I'm scared of the dark that's why my diamonds soo bright
I think I'm scared of the dark, so haters, get out my sight
Because I'm scared of the dark

I'm a money maker, I'm a heart breaker
I gamble, I'm a risk taker
I'm a dice shaker, I'm a bitch breaker
Got more racks than a pool table
I'm a money maker, I'm a heart breaker
I gamble, I'm a risk taker
I'm a dice shaker, I'm a bitch breaker
Got more racks than a pool table6Embed
