12 ContributorsBouldercrest Lyrics
I'm serving Coca Cola, me and my bola
It's heavy on the yola, or heavy with the soda
My momma screaming "Gucci Gucci Gucci what you doin'?"
"Look I ain't doin nothin
I'm cooking up them chickens momma, rent due Monday"
1000 pounds of coke coming in Sunday
Bentley coupe on bally's getting washed buy a junkie
Quarter for the Bart cuz I took it for the money
Still fuck around, still gettin to the money
They call me Gucci Mane and they say I sound funny
Besides the colored carats bitch ain't nothin' funny
Asphalt colored Aston Martin on Asantis
A stripper bitch that look TWICE better than Beyonce
Yo auntie wanna gram and yo uncle want a fo way
I ain't even front her cuz she never wanna pay me
Meet me on Flatsho nigga at the fo way
Meet me on Bouldercrest nigga on the Fire Way
Smell the Bubba Kush when you pull in the driveway
Gucci Mane LaFlare I'm coming in on the highway
15 hundred mid grade next Friday
Gucci Mane LaFlare everyday is a Friday
It's Gucci Mane yeaaah
Gucci Mane LaFlare you know I'm so player
I throw the money up, you know I don't care
They call me damn threes cuz I use to have the 30 birdies
Now they call me Jim Bore and now I got more dirty birdies
2-21 with the, the James Worthy
Got more hawks than a damn Hawks jersey
33 the Scottie Pippen got these niggas nervous
Sunday we serving bricks while they in service
Got washing powder and fleece, ya know detergent
Got t-shirts, they clean, they ain't dirty
Gucci Mane LaFlare, you know they wanna shop me
Kid with the CT 5 go kick rocks
Know he rock, that boy H-L shock
The boy so hot man he ain't luke warm
He got yo whole damn budget on his arm
It's 10 damn thousand to see him perform
It's 20 thousand dollars just to see him live
Add 12-5 for the GOD damn drive
It's Gucci Mane LaFlare I don't GOD damn drive
10 charge 8-5 man I'm gon' fly
I riding from the club so DUI
Me, DC, and OJ and we so fly
It's me, you, me, oh I say I
It's I am Gucci Mane why you lie?
It's that Mack who? Did that last year
40 grand floored customize my ear
60 grand floored make me shit up these pills
Got 6 pack because I'm rolling a pill
It's like the G-U, C-C-I, M-A-N-E fly
7 days a week
20 g's to speak
10 g's for half
19 for whole
I get my promotion straight out the doorYou might also likeEmbed
