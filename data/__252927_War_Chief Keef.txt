114 ContributorsWar Lyrics
Boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Don't want war
Pussy boy
Don't want war
Want war, want war
Nigga fuck your mama, she should’ve wore a condom
Boy don't want it
Pussy boy don't want it
Pussy boy
Pussy boy
Pussy boy
Pussy boy

Nigga, fuck your mama, she should’ve wore a condom
Pull up in that 'Rari, burning off this rubber
Niggas undercover, so you know I can’t trust them
I be smoking earth, boy, you be smoking bubba
The bitch like Benihana's, took that bitch to McDonald's
I got plenty condoms and I got plenty commas
If you want some beef, boy, I won't be your farmer
I might be your father, ball like Penny Hardaway
Judge tryna lock me up, 'cause my pee look darker
But that ain't gon' solve nothin', weed solve my problem
Guns for my armor, nigga, fuck security
Out the cut like barbers, got niggas Forrest Gumpin'
Smoking on this Compton, but bitch, I'm in Chiraq
Where you disrespect me at, bitch, that's where you die at
All these fucking lab rats, now I got my mouse trap
Niggas wanna fake kick it, wan' know where my house at
That life I ain't 'bout that, I'm 'bout pushing scalps back
Pull up on yo' block, bitch, let my niggas out that
Foreign car, clout that, I'm high off this Tooka pack
I'm high off this Aiki pack, I'm high off this Tu-Tu pack
Smoking on that Jay Loud, smoking on that FatHead
Run up on 4-6, leave a nigga flat dead
Shoot a 47, flying off like Batman
Boy, I got a bag, bitch, put that bag on that head
I'm high off this Chief Keef, got me feeling like Superman
That bitch called Chief Keef "G", bitch, I'm not no MuBu man
All these damn frenemies, I'm gon' call up PooPoo Man
I got niggas in these streets, they fuck around and do you, man
I’m rich, hallelujah, man, still got my toolie, man
Fuck with me, I’ll fuck around and screw your mans
Flexin' like a ruler, shoot at your medulla, man
And get your bitch, she wanna suck my dick, I knew it, man

Pussy boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war
Don't want war
Pussy boy don't want war, don't want war, want war

Come down your block like thunder, thunder, thunder
I just bought ten guns and ten pounds and ten mansions
Come through dunkin' shit, Kevin Durant, Lebron-in'
But you like to Twitter beef, pussy, how you warrin'?
Pussy, how you warrin'?
Pussy, how you warrin'?
Pussy, how you warrin'?
Pussy, how you warrin'?
How you warrin'?172Embed
