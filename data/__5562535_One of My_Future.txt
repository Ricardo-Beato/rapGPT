Freeband, mm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

One of my niggas got rich off bricks
One of my niggas got rich hittin' licks
One of my niggas got rich sellin' grass
One of my niggas got rich off swag
One of my niggas got rich off hoes
One of my niggas got rich off coke
One of my niggas be kickin' in doors
One of my niggas ain't got no soul

One of my niggas trappin' out his house
One of my niggas trappin' out a penthouse
One of my niggas don't talk, he a boss
One of my niggas come through, knock you off
One of my niggas drink syrup, no coughin'
One of my niggas be scamming, yeah
Bustin' checks, he the scammer of the year
One of my niggas comin' home in a year
One of my niggas got a body in here
One of my niggas on molly, need help
One of my niggas, he a real one, he rap
One of my niggas don't never play fair
One of my niggas be stalking the opps
He one of them niggas don't talk to the cops
One of my niggas turn a half to a block
One of my niggas got bags by the box
