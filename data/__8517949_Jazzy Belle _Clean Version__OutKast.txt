2 ContributorsJazzy Belle (Clean Version) Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

Oh, yes, I love her like Egyptian
Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bi**** to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill, boy, because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, f****, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting nig*** into the tеmple they call their body
Now еverybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They **** a different **** every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle
You might also like
See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon
Smoking an **** of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these **** in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
Bi***, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that **** but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southernplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a **** don’t even know yo' name
It’s a shame, you cracking 'em up and **** like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other **** be Dumb
And Dumber, yeah, you know what I’m saying

See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar (Star)
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are (Are)
Talk bad about her **** guaranteed to snap like bra (Bra)
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world (World)
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl (Curl)
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to hurl (Hurl), 'cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school, now they d****
Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be, I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures, baby
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her
