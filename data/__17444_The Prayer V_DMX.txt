5 ContributorsThe Prayer V LyricsLet us pray
Father thank you for makin' me righteous and accepted through the blood of Jesus
Because of that I am blessed and highly favored by you
I am the object of your affection, your favors surround me as a shield
And the first thing that people come in contact with is my favor-shield
Thank you that I have favor with you and man today
All day long, people go out of their way to bless and to help me
I have favor with everyone that I deal with today
Doors that were once closed are now open for me
I receive preferential treatment and I have special priveledges
I am God's favorite child
No good thing will he withhold from me
Because of God's favor my enemies cannot triumph over me
I have supernatural increase in promotions
I declare restoration of everything that the devil has stolen from me
I have honor in the midst of my adversaries, and an increase of assets
Especially in real estate and an expansion of territory
Because I am highly favored by God I experience great victories
Supernatural turnarounds and miraculous breakthroughs; in the midst of great impossibilities
I receive recognition, prominence and honor
Petitions are granted to me even by ungodly authorities
Policies, rules, regulations and laws are changed and reversed on my behalf
I win battles that I don't even have to fight because God fights them for me
This is the day, the set time, the designated moment for me to experience the free favors of God
That profusely and lavishly abound on my behalf
In Jesus' mighty name we have prayed
Amen, and AmenYou might also like10Embed
