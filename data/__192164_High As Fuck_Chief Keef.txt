22 ContributorsHigh As Fuck Lyrics
(You don't even wanna smoke no more)
I'm high as fuck, high as fuck
I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck
(Bitch, we just smoke blunt after blunt)
I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck
('Til you don't even wanna smoke no more)
I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck

Bitch, we just smoke blunt after blunt
'Til you don't even wanna smoke no more
My bitch Nina got a dick and my bitch need to suck on it
Gettin' money after money, I can't trust a soul no more
'Cause I got signed for a Bugatti and niggas got signed for a Volvo
The wrong kicks, 'cause I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck
I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck
I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck
I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck

I roll with people that will shoot you
Pistols bust bullets, fly like soo-soo
All my niggas wild, they cuckoo
Fuck with squad, then you gon' get that Mubu
She moving that cook move
She say she don't like me, she like my new shoes
I'm moving that guap move
I got a big, big, fat bankroll, same size as Young Chop's shoes
I got this nine on me so try your luck, try your luck
Try your luck, try your luck
I ain't blind, homie, I'ma fire you up, I'ma fire you up
I'ma fire you up, I'ma fire you up
If it's macaroni then buck buck, buck buck
Buck buck, buck buck
Got this cash on me like what what? What what?
What what? What what?

Bitch, we just smoke blunt after blunt
'Til you don't even wanna smoke no more
My bitch Nina got a dick and my bitch need to suck on it
Gettin' money after money, I can't trust a soul no more
'Cause I got signed for a Bugatti and niggas got signed for a Volvo
The wrong kicks, 'cause I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck
I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck
I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck
I'm high as fuck, I'm high as fuck4Embed
