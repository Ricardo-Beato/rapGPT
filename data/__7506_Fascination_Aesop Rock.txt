16 ContributorsFascination Lyrics
Shooken to Casper
Illustrate beautiful disaster
Flight of the mother ship lift to badger the male-factor
Marionette versus the threat of wire cutter function
Stereotypical Grinch bashing your pumpkin
Plug, try to count up your warrior hatchling batch before gestation segment ended
And head a platoon of embryonic remnants to the game board
Release Japanese beetle swarm to counter the spread of bitch crops
Demolish the harvest and herd colony out immediate
One massive attack, hunted, confronted and gutted
Most pungent component cloned in outrageous bunches
From the grimacing faces to the knots in my shoelaces
I'm a show you all the phases of a fuck up (Yeah)
Plucking the petals but every rose had its thorn
Consider that first warning, second will be good times, laughs and epitaphs
As a matter of basic principle next I set my boat a sail
I won't always be there for your tugging on my coat tails
Family stuck, voyage of the S.S. Martyr
Who you think put that unseen iceberg in the water?
Manufacture flotsam and jetsam from out your charter
We got the once pushovers pushing back a little harder now, blink
I think I can, I think I can
I got grips, muckraker major spin circles 'round sunken ships
Walk an invisible city of lost clans and he's jealous
Cause my silhouette had more dimensions than his game plans
You might also like
Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why I pass the hated wasteland with a grin, cause in the end I got my passions
While you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle
Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturbance with a smirk
Cause I feel I got direction in my work

And everything I touch magnificent
Picking apart a drunken township
Sitting in the rain rusting the nails my crown's bound with
If I had an anchor I would lay it in the dirt and mark today
"The Day The Earth Stood Still" while I complete my search
You honor delusions and falsified life comfort systems
As boy in the bubble huddled up to simple Simon subtle
Born tomahawk. Shock the peanut gallery loopy
Debate the cutesy, groupie, Kewpie doll community
And I'm hung in a virtual skin and bones emaciated ringworm
Circus freak bloodthirsty intern trainee urchin feast
With a delectable style compiled of that which stands
To buff a child's yellow brick vision of slick living
I observe the stories from my fire escape observatory
First I herd the glory, then desert the herbs that word it poorly, understood?
Well, maybe a pat on the back for the lucky losers
Who truly felt they were born to touch the music
I catalog cats as welcome mats, and for the ones
Insisting on dimming the stars I wipe my sneakers extra hard
I wish upon a penny toss that every servant will betray his gatekeeper
And leap to reap the freedom fighter mad galaxy
Huff the war gas vapors and cram hard for tomorrow
Brother, I own twice my weight in patience
Be it padded cubicle or beautiful tomb
I'll be listening 'til you whistling that more suitable tune
Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why I pass the hated wasteland with a grin, cause in the end I got my passions
While you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle
Fascination, fascination
Fascination, fascination
And everything I do I'm fascinated with
That's why I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturbance with a smirk
Cause I feel I got direction in my workEmbed
