Got a darkskin girl, 5' 8" with the brown eyes
We been up and down, had a couple crashes but she still ride
She go to school, got two jobs, drive the same Kia 'cause it still slide
Work so hard on her off day, she be still tired
I just wanna take away the pain
I just wanna put you up on game
I just wanna help you make you better, wish you would've never gave it to that lame
Even if we do our own thang, the bond we got can't be explained
Girl, I'm just speakin' for future reference (Oh, oh), 'cause I understand feelings change (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)

You're my little secret (Secret)
That's how we should keep it (How we should keep it)
We should never let it go, never let it show
You're my, you're my, oh yeah

I don't care what these hoes think that they got goin' on
I've been here day one, I know what's goin' on
You ain't gotta try to tell me, like I know my place
I never went too far, I always find my way, back to you
Ain't no way I could lose you
Sometimes it's just things in life just worth keepin'
Why we ain't creepin'?
I'm just your little secret
That's how we should keep it, yeah, babe
'Cause you know and I know
You might also like
You're my little secret (Secret)
That's how we should keep it (How we should keep it)
We should never let it go, never let it show
You're my, you're my, oh yeah

I hope you had a dream 'bout me
'Cause I had a dream 'bout you
Hope you been thinking 'bout me
'Cause I been thinking 'bout you
Girl, I'm tryna make you my wife
I done told the thots, "I'm through"
If you ever leave my side, I'ma probably lose my cool
We was in high school and your friends said that it won't work
From the sixth grade to the ninth grade, she did my homework
Put my pistol in your book bag, you ain't even own a purse
You done held me down from the jumpstart, you deserve a verse
You my little secret (You my little secret)
That's how we gon' keep it (That's how we gon' keep it)
Got done gamblin', feelin' like Michael, now I'm finna beat it
'Cause I like a couple pictures on Instagram that don't mean I'm cheatin'
'Cause I'm hangin' out with my dawgs late night that don't mean I'm cheatin'

Oh-oh, oh, yeah-yeah, yeah
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
We should never let it, never let it show
'Cause you know and I know
You're my little secret (Yeah, yeah)
That's how we should keep it (Yeah)
We should never let it go, never let it show (Oh yeah)
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go4Embed
