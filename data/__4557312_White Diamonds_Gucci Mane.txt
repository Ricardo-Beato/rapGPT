6 ContributorsWhite Diamonds Lyrics
Got a lil boy with big wheels
Got a low car with big wheels
I'm a tall nigga with low tops
I'm a hood nigga with a big deal
Got a black girl on four pills, got a white girl need more pills
It's 2012 nigga, so that means I get more skrill
I'm so hood, I'm too real
Hard to stop, and I'm hard to kill
Probably gon die a bachelor, I'm single as a one-dollar bill
I'm a good cook, I got chef skills
Got fish scale, like fish gills
Tryna jack Gucci, that's unreal
Bet a hundred K, you won't live
(It's Gucci!)

Red and blue diamonds, it look like a riot
Shoot him up, bang bang, wish a nigga try it
Mike WiLL Made-It, Wooh and Gucci slayed it
My career taking off, his career fading
Red and blue diamonds, it look like a riot
Shoot him up, bang bang, wish a nigga try it
Mike WiLL Made-It, Wooh and Gucci slayed it
My career taking off, his career fading
You might also like
Used to kick doe, put your hands up
Pop a  nigga, make a nigga stand up
Chopper shells sit him right back down
Life on mute, won't make no sound
Woo Da king of beasts, fucking up the chain, I don't need no leash
Catch a nigga slippin', and my boys gon feast
I could do it acapella, I don't need no beat
No BS, boys be on that BS
Eighty-thousand worth of diamonds, every time that you see us
I think I should slow it down, can't forget my old flow
My life a mill, been on, Wooh 

Red and blue diamonds, it look like a riot
Shoot him up, bang bang, wish a nigga try it
Mike WiLL Made-It, Wooh and Gucci slayed it
My career taking off, his career fading
Red and blue diamonds, it look like a riot
Shoot him up, bang bang, wish a nigga try it
Mike WiLL Made-It, Wooh and Gucci slayed it
My career taking off, his career fadingEmbed
