6 ContributorsKeep Going Lyrics
No domestic violence I put my hands on you
As soon as I walked in she like 'them bands on you
And if you act right girl, them bands might land on you
You got me feeling like Future I like the stand on you
And you just keep going, going, going
And this money keep blowin', blowin', blowin'
And you just keep going
And this money keep blowin'

And I'm like round and round and round and round we go
All this money on this floor, girl you can go and touch your toes
A whole brick in ones look like I done signed with the pros
And the way your body move, I thought your momma was a pro
I know that they be watching all this cash that I be blowin'
And I know that they be smelling all this gas that I be blowin'
I walked up in this bitch left pocket cheesecake right pocket still sloppy
And them hoes they run to Ca$h Out and Young Thug, they know we got it
Plus we say we got it
I pull up in that Maybach tell the Valet, hey he got it
Plus the shooter with me, no Master P but yeah he 'bout it
I brought out all my jewelry, now she heard of me
These niggas broke, need surgery

As long as we fuckin' I'ma spend my cash on you
You slidin' down the pole, look at that ass on you
And I'm on that young nigga shit, I'm tryna smash on you
On your worst day you a nine like Steve Nash on you
If you just keep goin', goin', goin'
I'ma keep it goin', yeah, I'ma keep it goin', yeah
So you just keep goin' goin', goin', goin'
You might also like
I'll coax it outta you, I'll coax it outta you
I hope you feel better, why?
'Cause the jewelry had you sick, tired of callin' you
When my lifestyle is smoke stank blunts
And ride around with them choppers
And the cars full of niggas like Rastas
Stay on Molly's and them my partners
What the fuck you mean baby girl? Ca$h Out the man
And if you ever thinking about robbin', you'll need 1000 plans
But I love you and I trust you
And I never put no one above you, girl
Yeah, and I will mind ya, I was lookin' but I couldn't find ya
And when I find ya, I'ma get behind ya like ayy

As long as we fuckin' I'ma spend my cash on you
You slidin' down the pole, look at that ass on you
And I'm on that young nigga shit, I'm tryna smash on you
On your worst day you a nine like Steve Nash on you
If you just keep goin', goin', goin'
I'ma keep it goin', yeah, I'ma keep it goin', yeah
So you just keep goin' goin', goin', goin'1Embed
