You ain’t never had bricks, no way
You ain’t never hit a plug, no way
You ain’t never cash out, no way
You ain’t never had a strap, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way

Finessing the plug for the cheddar
I understand I can do better
I am the king, no Correta
I understand I’m a trendsetter
I know that you lying ‘bout bricks
I know that you lying ‘bout licks
You not in the trap with the zips
I know that you lie 'bout your bitch
Stop lying, No way
You never, done it
I won, the top, I earn it
My diamonds, are green, like Kermit
You're a worm, you’re squirmin'
I’m a teacher, listenin' and learnin’
Gone!

You ain’t never had bricks, no way
You ain’t never hit a plug, no way
You ain’t never cash out, no way
You ain’t never had a strap, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way

It’s GuWop up in this bitch, call me Mr. pink slip
I don’t slip, double cup, pour it up
Yeah I keep a double pink, that's enough
Pour it up, nah not enough
Gucci Mane, call your bluff
Man your diamonds ain’t wet enough
Man your car ain't wet enough
Man your money ain’t large enough
Gucci Mane, I’m in charge
I'm the boss and I’m backin’ up a Rolls Royce
Drop my top, all my rods they add it up
Had one, I got two
Now then three, not enough
Need four, I need more
‘Nother whore, get another one
Gucci Mane La Flare, big diamonds I could smoother one
Fly the scott and cover one
I’m the Governor
And I got a Ferrari nigga it got no cover

You ain’t never had bricks, no way
You ain’t never hit a plug, no way
You ain’t never cash out, no way
You ain’t never had a strap, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no wayEmbed
