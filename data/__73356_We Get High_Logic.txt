We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at

From the back to the front door
Dealers on the Southside sellin' on their front door
Little bit of weed, little bit of crack, whatever you need
While I'm sellin' out shows in the ice cold
Shout out to the homies in the front row with the blunt rolled
That waited for hours in the snow just to see me flow
So you know I gotta stay after the show
'Cause if Chi-Town show love, I'ma show love
Outside, no gloves in the wintertime
'Cause I'm hungry like dinnertime
Stayin for every single one of my fans
Autographs 'til I couldn't feel my hands
Just a man with a plan, but you wouldn't understand
I get high by the notes, you get high by the gram (Sinatra)
While you smoke to this, reminisce
When I wrote to this, up-and-comers take note to this
We get it done on tour, waking up before the sundown
Lake Shore Drive shooting videos (Logic)
On the block getting spotted by them city hoes (Hey!)
I know I never had to wonder if it's love or not
Shout-out to the homies up at Jugrnaut
For keeping a motherfucker fresh, hell yes
No contest when it comes to gear in the city they be the best
Love my girls outgoing in my City, Chi
But it's MD till the day I die
You might also like
We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky
Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry
We get high, oh so high, that's what they say in the Chi
I get high, you get high 'cause I'm the one that supply
We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky
Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry
We get high, oh so high, that's what they say in the Chi
I get high, you get high 'cause I'm the one that supply

We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at

Shout-out to the Bobby Soxer girls that just love the flow
Chillin out late night with the weed lit blunt split and the paper rolled
RattPack smoking loudpack yeah they 'bout that
Haters talking shit yeah I never doubt that
With the GPS flow we re-route that
Road to riches we be 'bout that
Getting money like Oprah
Fryin' motherfuckers like Okra
Put your L up if you be a smoker
Full-time toker
Everything I got that's what I'm given no division till it's over
Sleeping on the Young Sinatra like a sedative
Now they on a brother's dick, so repetitive
And they wonder why, and they wonder why
We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky
Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry
We get high, oh so high, that's what they say in the Chi
I get high, you get high 'cause I'm the one that supply
We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky
Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry
We get high, oh so high, that's what they say in the Chi
I get high, you get high 'cause I'm the one that supply
We get high

We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at
We get higher and higher44Embed
