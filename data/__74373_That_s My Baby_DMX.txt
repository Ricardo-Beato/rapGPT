5 ContributorsThatâ€™s My Baby Lyrics
It's like a walk in the park
She even fuck with a nigga in the dark
She's been fucking with a nigga from the start
Cause she fucked with a nigga from the heart
Man, it don't get no realer
See her fucking with another nigga, I kill her
That's how much I feel her
It's like I'm the fiend and she's the dealer
That's my baby
She's the only one that make me crazy
Ain't no maybes, never acts shady
And at the end of the day, still my lady

Say what you want, that's my baby
Only one that drives me crazy
End of the day, she's still my lady
She got my back, I got hers
She got my back, I got hers
She got my back, I got hers
She got my back, I got hers
Bigger than words

Hey, something special about her
And it ain't even the pussy, I just can't live without her
Independent shit, yeah she work
Strong, but if I do wrong, then yeah she hurt
Hey, we all got feelings
What we feel is so real, it's straight to the ceiling
After a long day of robbing and stealing
A nigga come home for some (sexual healing)
That's my boo
Only she understand what I been through
She got my heart, and it do what it do
I love you, baby

Man, I went to school with her
Since 14, I was fool with her
I see her bent over, I shot pool with her
Bitch was so bad, didn't know what to do with her
In the hood, she was that chick
And I was that nigga who with that bitch
And if went and I lost my life
I'd die knowing she was my wife, I'd rest in peace
