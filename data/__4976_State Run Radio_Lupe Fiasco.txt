You must be a radio station
And who are we, we must be
A number one song, spinnin' all day long
And over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win when we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

We interrupt this broadcast
To bring you this special message about the forecast
The future's cloudy and it's raining on the poor class
Road to peace is closed, heavy traffic on the war paths
Love is balling on a budget
The military's says it's gon' need more cash
To keep fighting for your gas, keep us in our hoods
And hope we never explore past, stay inside of your half
Believe the lies you learn in your class
That there's no treasure in your trash
And a Sealy has the same feeling as the floor has
And that's where you should stay; this is what they play
You might also like
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

You're now tuned into the weakest
Frequency of fear, keep you locked right here
And hope you never leave this, never be a leader
Think inside the box, and follow all procedures
Never ever believe that, you will never need this
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this
Hi you're on the air, now what you want to hear
Well we ain't got the truth but how about a remix
Different is never good, good is only what we pick
You ain't got a hit, unless it sounds like these did
Not too smart, you will be a superstar
And if you dumb it some, maybe you could be number one
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

So beware what's on the airwaves
And be more aware of what's not gettin' airplay
Independent spirit, you can barely hear what they're sayin'
Truth ain't getting on like shampoo on an airplane
Propaganda's everywhere, constantly on replay
All the hits, all the time, back-to-back on relay
We're really where it lives, make them hear the records we play
Build your own station, become your own DJs

You must be a radio station
And who are we, we must be
A number one song, spinnin' all day long
And you put me on daily rotation
You're on the air, we know you're scared
But we don't care, we'll play this here
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio8Embed
