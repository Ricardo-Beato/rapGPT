19 ContributorsNo Problems Lyrics
Shooter holding my pistol as I switch lanes in that Audi
Tennis shoes my choices ain't shit changed but my bottom
Ain't shit lame 'bout my partners
Your bitch came to my house to get fucked by my roster
My team homie, Peewee put me on it, yeah
These niggas don't want no problems, yeah
I can see it in their eyes, the feeling's in my heart
Got me thinkin' through my mind
And I can't hide the feeling inside
I don't know how I feel like this but shit just got real like this

Rich Homie, this feeling, man it on vibe
And can't no suckers get in my ride
So I slowly let them Forgis glide
Now let that marinate while your bitch get in my ride
She can't believe her eyes, the ghost came suicide
I'm trapping in Guisseppe, gotta make a play, bae let's ride
In traffic with goons behind me, my dawgs gon' spray them chromes
And if you got a problem, my god I'm 'fraid I'm drunk
Rich Homie where they do, it's your boy Longway
I count a lot of cash, my homies hold AKs
And if you try to pass, make sure you saying grace
My homies at your ass, aiming at your face
You might also like
I say my shooter holding my pistol as I switch lanes in that Audi
Tennis shoes my choices ain't shit changed but my bottom
Ain't shit lame bout my partners
Your bitch came to my house to get fucked by my roster
My team homie, Peewee put me on it, yeah
These niggas don't want no problems, yeah
I can see it in their eyes, the feeling's in my heart
Got me thinkin' through my mind
And I can't hide the feeling inside
I don't know how I feel like this but shit just got real like this

Yeah I don't put sixes on her, she should put fours on
I told her wear it just so I could fuck her with her clothes on
50 bitches hit my line in jail on my cellphone
Niggas say he got the sticky icky purp velcro
Say he got a truck load, tell me what I don't know
Niggas that I run with will rob Wells Fargo
Got a clip and a gun in every pocket of my cargo
Half a million dollar worth of bales in my condo
Frisco, oreo, nigga not Nabisco
I'm in molly world, I done hurled on my girl and my shell toes
Snuck up in the club with a pint and a elbow
I say my shooter holding my pistol as I switch lanes in that Audi
Tennis shoes my choices ain't shit changed but my bottom
Ain't shit lame bout my partners
Your bitch came to my house to get fucked by my roster
My team homie, Peewee put me on it, yeah
These niggas don't want no problems, yeah
I can see it in their eyes, the feelings  through my mind
And I can't hide the feeling inside
I don't know how I feel like this but shit just got real like this3Embed
