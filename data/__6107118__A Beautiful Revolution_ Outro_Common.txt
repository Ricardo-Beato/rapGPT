3 Contributors(A Beautiful Revolution) Outro Lyrics
What is a beautiful revolution?
(A beautiful revolution)
A beautiful revolution is when old and outdated ideas
Are replaced by new and better ones
Everybody's in peace, everybody's shaking hands
A beautiful revolution?
The Earth going around the Sun, it's a beautiful thing
(The truth is, revolution can be small
It's in the stillness, and it can be painful and warm
Because it's happening on the inside first
It can't happen out there unless it's happening in here)
(A beautiful revolution is a truthful revolution
A revolution that balances the extremes of
Of inner and outer, light and dark, good and evil
Masculine, feminine, black, white)
(People were able to change other peoples' minds
Without any loss of life and without any shedding of blood)
{That's a beautiful revolution}
{That's, that's what a beautiful revolution looks like to me}

And finally, we take us back
The boat and the big house
My body, my thoughts, our words
Our fate, my people, our peace, my people
Come, sit down for a spell
We gather to announce our freedom
Unafraid to turn our backs, and we can bring you
And nobody wants us dead
And we are free to rest and tend our wounds
Give us this day to grieve who we could've been
Give us this day to bless the Atlantic floor
To worship what was stolen
Give us more than survival
Weave fists, glistening with blue magic and black glory
Only roses in our mouths
We pray like this, we keep us safe
We can breathe, we give us breath
And we is us again, amenYou might also likeEmbed
