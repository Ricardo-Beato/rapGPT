I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high

Well it's the funk elastic, the blunt I twist it
The slamafied, Buddhafied funk on your discus
Oh, what, you missed this? You got to bear witness
Catch a ho and another ho, Merry Christmas
Yes I smoke shit, straight off the roach clip
I wrote shit for the blunted ones to approach it
Forward motion, make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion? Yo, I'm not jokin' around
People learnin' 'bout, what they're smokin'
My oven's on high when I roast the quail
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale
Exhale, now you felt the funk of the Thai
Wanna feel the effects?

I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high

Yo, hits from the, from the bong, from the bong
Yo, hits from the bong
Yo, hits from the bong
Yo, hits from the, from the bong, from the bong
From the bong, from the bong, from the bong, from the bong
From the bong, from the bong, from the bong, from the bong7Embed
