Yeah, the crazy, the wizard
So much whiskey all in my liver
I really like the punch it delivers
Makes me warm while I high-five sinners
All alone, trying to hide from the shadows
Ain't no use, it seems everywhere, they follow
They know where I be at
Infect my mind, tryna get me

These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more (no more)
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more (no more)

Life is like that
Beat me up, and I'll fight right back
Poof, poof, be gone
I see the devil linger on
Yeah, stuck in my hell
Lied to my mom, and I ain't doing so well
Lord, let me in
I feel like He's my only friend
You might also like
Yeah, the rager, the menace
Hate me now, then hate me when I'm winning
Work so hard to not go insane
It's a full-time job to not lose my faith
Okay, I've been here before
Alone for the umpteenth time or more
I'm tired of motherfuckers saying that they worried 'bout me
When, in fact, they probably never gave a fuck about me

These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more

Yeah, life is like that
Beat me up, and I'm fighting right back
Poof-poof, be gone
I see the devil linger on
Yeah, I wanna win
As long as I can do the work within
Lord, let me in
I feel like You're my only friend
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more

Yeah, the rager, the menace28Embed
