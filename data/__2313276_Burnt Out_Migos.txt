11 ContributorsBurnt Out Lyrics
Aye, you remember that young nigga we seen in the hood?
Hell yeah
That nigga burnt out
You remember he came and told me that shit, man?

You turn a dollar to a million (million)
In a trap I look like a chameleon
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings (nah)
Got the chopper for the victims
Momma told me to go kill 'em (momma!)
So I'm in an all black like I'm John Wick
Open up the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That's a life sentence, quarter mill on my wrist (damn!)
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
That nigga burnt out
On a highway with hundred pounds
That nigga burnt out
Young nigga trap out his momma's house (trap, trap)
That nigga burnt out
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
Damn that nigga burnt out

12 got him in interrogation but he burnt out and he ain't sangin' (nah)
They'll give a young nigga a life sentence if they ever find a fucking banger (damn!)
He a young nigga still trapping and banging
Walk around twisting his fingers but he's still in the kitchen and whipping the pot
Watching the dope look like it Kurt Angle (lock)
Hit the pot at every angle (hit it)
In the kitchen and I'm cookin' Topanga
I don't really fuck with strangers (nah)
Never know he could be sangin'
If you want a hunnid, we can arrange it
No refunds so it changes
You can test the dope with your pinky finger
Now he feeling like a Power Ranger

You turn a dollar to a million (million)
In a trap I look like a chameleon
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings (nah)
Got the chopper for the victims
Momma told me to go kill 'em (momma!)
So I'm in an all black like I'm John Wick
Open up the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That's a life sentence, quarter mill on my wrist (damn!)
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
That nigga burnt out
On a highway with hundred pounds
That nigga burnt out
Young nigga trap out his momma's house (trap, trap)
That nigga burnt out
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
Damn that nigga burnt out
The nigga walking with a dirty stick
Burnt out, he looking sick
Robbing, finessing everything in sight
That nigga Debo 'cause he's taking shit (Debo!)
Young nigga fifteen and he with the shit (with the shit)
His brother just caught a charge for a brick (brick)
He sent the little bitch on a trip to pick up some shit from the Mexicans (Migo!)
Momma preaching like a reverend (momma!)
He a rookie, wanna be a veteran (veteran)
All he wanted was a necklace (necklace)
And his trap game be excellence (excellence)
He like the boot of the Hannah Montana
Young nigga burnt out like I blew out the candles
No ski-mask, got a bag but she said fuck the cameras
Walking with a dirty stick, long as an antenna

You turn a dollar to a million (million)
In a trap I look like a chameleon
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings (nah)
Got the chopper for the victims
Momma told me to go kill 'em (momma!)
So I'm in an all black like I'm John Wick
Open up the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That's a life sentence, quarter mill on my wrist (damn!)
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
That nigga burnt out
On a highway with hundred pounds
That nigga burnt out
Young nigga trap out his momma's house (trap, trap)
That nigga burnt out
That nigga burnt out
Burnt out
Damn that nigga burnt out2Embed
