5 ContributorsFor Da Uh (Jus So I Could Get Some) Lyrics
Why you wanna walk over me? (for da uh)
Take control and won't let go of me? (for da uh)
You said that you had plans for me? (for da uh)
You mean it was all a scam? (Jus so I could get some)
A nigga tell a bitch anythang (for da uh)
And play the same ol’ silly game (for da uh)
I thought you said you loved me (for da uh)
I gave you somethin' to nut to (Jus so I could get some)

Relationships, is full of headaches and heartbreaks
I know where it's heading, had me switchin’ gears and pumpin' brakes
Catch myself, before I make the first mistake
Whenever its feelings, I with yellow tape
It's hard for me to change my ways from a guerilla stage
Whenever its drama, you put it on center stage
Girl, you run mo' games than the Staple Center
With the cheerleader skirt
...

Why you wanna walk over me? (for da uh)
Take control and won't let go of me? (for da uh)
You said that you had plans for me? (for da uh)
You mean it was all a scam? (Jus so I could get some)
A nigga tell a bitch anythang (for da uh)
And play the same ol' silly game (for da uh)
I thought you said you loved me (for da uh)
I gave you somethin' to nut to (Jus so I could get some)
You might also like
Nigga, so you sayin' all of that was for the twat
You sold me a dream when you said you’d take me off of the block
I never aksed but you offered a lot
So I ate it all up cuz I liked the way you hit my spot
And like a bitch I caught feelings for you
Wanted to marry you, probably have a baby or two
And that’s my word

But hol' up
I’m feelin' you too but slow up
You said it's a dream I sold you but so what?
With so much, time invested with yo' ex, it’s
Hard to trust you, regardless of the
Way, you make me feel when we chill undercover
Still, I'm 'bout buildin' not tryna' fill up rubbers
When I tell you the real, you just tell me you love me
And that you hate me for the same reason you want me
Say you jealous of the blunts and the block and the bitches
That seem to be gettin' all my attention, but listen

Why you wanna walk over me? (for da uh)
Take control and won't let go of me? (for da uh)
You said that you had plans for me? (for da uh)
You mean it was all a scam? (Jus so I could get some)
A nigga tell a bitch anythang (for da uh)
And play the same ol' silly game (for da uh)
I thought you said you loved me (for da uh)
I gave you somethin' to nut to (Jus so I could get some)
Now I don't mean to give you the cold shoulder
But how you think I keep O's in the sofa
How you think we blow smoke when we rollin'
Stay fresh, gold on my chest, not stolen
I gotta grind, a lot a mind, got a lot a time
I was preoccupied, you not satisfied
You emotional, I was tryna' stroke a hoe
It was physical, but you don't feel it's thru
Look what I did to you, keep a wet pillow boo
Makin' love to your man, close yo' eyes, think of who
And it's cool, we just leave it like that
Cuz if it's mines and I let it go, it's comin' right back

Why you wanna walk over me? (for da uh)
Take control and won't let go of me? (for da uh)
You said that you had plans for me? (for da uh)
You mean it was all a scam? (Jus so I could get some)
A nigga tell a bitch anythang (for da uh)
And play the same ol' silly game (for da uh)
I thought you said you loved me (for da uh)
I gave you somethin' to nut to (Jus so I could get some)Embed
