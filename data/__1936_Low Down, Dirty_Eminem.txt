I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty! (Ahh)
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
Warnin', this shit's gon' be rated R: restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my mama, "Bitch, you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself, and got convicted
Wearin' visors, sunglasses, and disguises
'Cause my split personality is havin' an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearin' voices in my head while these whispers echo
"Murder-murder, redrum!", brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (Rah!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler (Ah! Ah!)
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring yo bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
You might also like
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch of crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doin' whippets, passed out like sampler snippets (Hi)
Where's the weed? I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine, so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke and left rich
Walking biohazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check, bitch!
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast (The fuck is this?)
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips (Pew)
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence (Hahahaha)
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
My head's ringing, like it was Spider-Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Ah-de-la, ah-de-la)
Delinquent, chokin' microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like, "Ooh, this is good! Who sings this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit" (Drug shit)
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, livin' on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishin'
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying; God, is that you? (God, is that you?)
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip-hop
They say that's where it lives, the closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks (Pssh)
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty! (Ahh)
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
