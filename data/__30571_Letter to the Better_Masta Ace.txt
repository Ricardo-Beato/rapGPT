5 ContributorsLetter to the Better Lyrics"Is everybody ready? All right, here we go"
Allow me to begin, once again my friend
Yo, it's Ace in Action, here to send
Any and all MC's into a frenzy
'Cause I'll take a rapper out just like a Benzi
Yeah, this ain't the same old, lame old
Bragging and nagging, yo all that became old
Years ago, and yo, here's a pro-
Fession that I'm am fresh in, and so...
I am going on and on like an adventure
Some of y'all in awe from that cause I sent ya
Hmmm, this move is forward, or would
You like it if I pause, yeah you sure would
But I ain't pausing, no stop, just like a freeway
Rappers, you play me too close, I need some leeway
'Cause it's about time for the party to get a
Little bit hyper and yo, this is a letter to the better
So go check the mail for yours, I unveil the jaws
Then I dog ya, get down on all fours
So we can brawl, the capital A's, the dream
Rhymes are fierce, pierce your ears like a laser beam
Reach, and I'll teach you each the speech
Spectrum, even if you add bleach
It won't fade or run, cause it's made of one-
Hundred percent knowledge to weigh a ton
Listen bud, yo the rhyme's a dud
Pencil or pen and I'll draw
Blood I'll take a strong stance, strictly long pants
No short-taking, when you hear my song, dance!
'Cause you can't keep still, so dance 'til
You drop or the hip-hop stop, but it never will
Yeah, now if you're better, then here's the move
Ace in Action, I'm here to show and prove
Plain and simple, pretend my rhyme's a pimple
Now bust it, and watch it ache your temple
You need Buffrin, you're suffering, can you cope?
Nah, nope, cause it's dope, and you hope
I might slip or trip, stall or fall
But all hope is lost, you've been stalled
You're drugged and youd've been bugged if I'd said a
Another line, end this verse, of my letter to the better
You might also likeI'm flowing, so in fact, kind of rivery
Are you a dope MC? Special delivery
There's no time, here's a rhyme, go ahead open it
This is a letter to the better, I know you're hoping it
Might be some claim on my greatness
But once I state this, watch the crabs rate this
You wear a crown, you don't deserve one
You need a meal for the mind and I'll serve one
Like a chef so def, I'm gonna rip up
Rhymes they gonna rip up those that turn a lip up
One page at a time, you keep reading
Each stage of the rhyme, where's it leading?
You want to know where a path leads, you follow it
I feed you your pride and make you swallow it
Used to be an innocent bystander and the
Lotta years filled my ears with slander
Why should I choose to get used to the way you burn?
When will you learn that every rapper has a turn?
And when the spotlight shines on you, you ought to glow
And show, the next man how to grow
And so, enough said about yourself
The central wealth of our people is mental health
And good things come in due time
And through rhyme, watch as a few climb
Non stop, straight to the top just to get a
Great big piece of the pie, this is a letter to the betterEmbed
