33 ContributorsMegan’s Piano Lyrics
And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it

Big-ass chain 'round my neck so these niggas know I'm rich and I don't need shit but the dick
Big-ass stack in this purse so these niggas know I'm workin', I'm holdin' this Glock in my Birkin
Niggas gotta hold that L tryna come for my pen, I'm really finna make another M
Now, tell me how the fuck I'm in the wrong if I don't want the nigga and he still ain't fuckin' with the bitch?

I be workin', I make moves in silence
Hoes might never like me and I'm fine with it
Nasty, I'm a real nigga fantasy
I'll drop dead 'fore a broke nigga handle me
D'USSÉ, this rich bitch energy
Y'all lil' hoеs still drinkin' that Hennessy
Messy, and I'm sick of y'all tryin' it
Bitch got rеceipts, but ain't never finna buy shit (Ah)

Sorry, hoes hate me 'cause I'm the it girl
I ain't never asked to be the shit, girl
Don't call me "sis", 'cause I'm not your sister
You really need to come and get your mister
Seein' all my opps linked up in a picture
Everybody look busted, injured
Stalkin' my page, bitch probably wanna scissor
All in her mouth like I kissed her
You might also like
I be workin', I make moves in silence
Hoes might never like me and I'm fine with it
Nasty, I'm a real nigga fantasy
I'll drop dead 'fore a broke nigga handle me
D'USSÉ, this rich bitch energy
Y'all lil' hoes still drinkin' that Hennessy
Messy, and I'm sick of y'all tryin' it
Bitch got receipts, but ain't never finna buy shit

Bad bitches run in my pack, gang shit
Cartier frames, spot a bitch on some lame shit
Broke niggas all in my way, clear 'em
Chains ain't makin' no noise? They ain't big enough
Wildin', on a boat on an island
When I throw it back, bet I make him throw the towel in
I got a nigga, but I don't need one
He fuck up, I'ma have my fun
Teacup, I can fit a bitch in my purse
Which one of y'all wanna go first?
Spicy, ain't a bitch out built like me
I run shit, probably how I got a deal with Nike
Beefin'? You just mad we ain't speakin'
And I'm the one that put the roof where you sleepin'
Phoney, I don't need no new homies
I'm the reason all of my opps ain't homeless (Ah)4Embed
