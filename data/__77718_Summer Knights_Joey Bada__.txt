64 ContributorsSummer Knights Lyrics
And thatâ€™s all people wanna see truthfully
Don't stop it, Bad, just keep it runnin'
(You already know what I'm talking 'bout, you)
(He don't even want to go right now)
(Let's talk about, yo, yo, yo, let's talk about how Demetrius lookin'. Cali slackin', slackin' over here)
(First of all, )
(Nigga, every time I see you, you look like you just bought a joint)
And just ride with a nigga like
Just fly with a nigga like
Just vibe with a nigga like
Uh, uh, one-two
Show you what this do, yo

It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
Clouds is they limits 'cause we in 'em
Eyes low, squinted, more L's but we winning
Acting like it's hard to find women when I'm in these hard-to-find linens
Remember those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ends, and it's only the beginning
Big pimpin', fooling dimes, rob 'em for they innocence
Cake like Entenmann's, flow sweet like cinnamon
He a child but they treat him like a bigger man
'Cause when the pen in his hand, they big 'em up like he Jigga man
Know you see him in the mirror fam
The ones who say you ain't hot be your biggest fan like, "Nigga, damn"
Before he got popular, he been the man
With your chick in the cam, rolling through an Instagram
Got a whiff of grands, now everybody say they distant fam
Know the haters still jelly, but fuck it though; it's the jam
It's the fuckin' jam
You might also like
Sorry I kept y'all waiting
1999, 'til forever
The era, no better
Nothing more, nothing less
