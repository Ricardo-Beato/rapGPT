39 ContributorsBank Closed Lyrics
So, they callin' me a legend off of six years of work
So, I guess in another six years (Commission), I'll be a god to you niggas
(Holiday Season!)
Yeah, I'm a god to you niggas, man
Feed me grapes and shit
Hahahaha
This is Bang 2 right here
Sosa, what up, nigga?
Bang, nigga
Bang, nigga
(Oh, it's Holiday Season, nigga!)
Chi-Town, what's up?

I got two chains on, I got two thangs on me
Shawty gave me head like she got two brains on her (yeah)
Can't wear these True's no more, bitch, I got food stains on 'em
This nigga say he don't like me, his bitch got who ringtone? (damn)
I got Play-Doh, I don't play, though
And I just smoked earth, boy, not no mango
And right now, I like Beamer trucks, not no Range Rovers
On my way to pick up 50 thousand but the bank closed

What you say, ho? I got that K, ho
Shoot a nigga dead then go smoke my brains out
I donâ€™t wife no bitch, I ain't got no main ho
Ion't fuck with niggas, I see haters, Maino
Me and Franklins hang hoe, check out my bankroll
I ain't answer my FaceTime so this bitch try to tango
And I know that I'm a rapper, I still got them thangs on me
Spilled a drink on me, I slapped her 'cause I had to change clothes
Hear the cops comin'
Had to smoke a nigga 'cause he a lame, I'm not one
Why you think I bought this double trigger? I'ma spark somethin'
Tadoe off that molly, tryna pop somethin'
Try to take my jewelry, you'll get shot up

I got two chains on, I got two thangs on me
Shawty gave me head like she got two brains on her
Can't wear these True's no more, bitch, I got food stains on 'em
This nigga say he don't like me, his bitch got who ringtone?
I got Play-Doh, I don't play, though
And I just smoked earth, boy, not no mango
And right now, I like Beamer trucks, not no Range Rovers
On my way to pick up 50 thousand but the bank closed9Embed
