It's to the listeners
It's to the listeners
It's to the listeners
It's to the listeners
It's to the listeners
It's to the listeners

It's to the listeners, for those that have a ear for this
State of the art, engineered for the mix
Eardrums are playin' along to what I'm sayin', you're singin' a song
Stevie Blass on the keyboard, swingin' along
But you don't have to dance, play it cool and listen
My DJ's mixin' and I'll do the quizzin'
'Cause who is number one? If not best, then better
Here's a hint, the eighteenth letter
The rhymes is sportable, microphone is portable
For any immortal man, swords is not affordable
Never take a loss 'cause I'm hard to beat
I ain't cheap, but don't sell me a dream, I don't sleep
I'm paid in full, so save the bull
This ain't a stick-up, you don't have to wave your tool
You feel sure, and you want more, then wipe your sweat
'Cause I just wanted to see how hype you could get
'Cause when I came in the door
Steppin' hard enough to shake the floor
I just started, but the others can't make no more
Runnin' out of beats, breaks and out of time
If I was gone, you'd be runnin' out of rhymes
I prove records don't have to be long
If it's understood and the story is strong
You could speak out and hold the crowd as prisoners
The people is peepless, it's to the listeners
You might also like
Shh, it's to the listeners
You still listenin'?
It's to the listeners
Shh

I'm the lord for somethin' you can absorb
Try and control and be cautious, but the cuts and the chords
Make me deeper than down, I make the crowd crowd around
People are peepless 'cause the soloist found
Phrases, thoughts made by the R of course
One thing I do is keep 'em different and far from yours
You keep talkin', when will all the damage be done?
You say you're rulin', but when I'm in the place, you don't come
Maybe you're waitin' to see what I'm makin'
One more style gets taken, then I'ma be breakin'
Into patterns and pauses, piano is soft
But make it hard for you to start where I left off
You find yourself lost 'til the point is across
You hit reverse to rewind it, that's when you hit the pause
I set the scene, first, you hear mixin'
Then the microphone fiend's in effect, still listenin'?
Pay close attention, never before mentioned
Listen up, I got a brand-new invention
Made from a musician, its notes are played crisp
But listeners listen to what I wrote on a disc
Copywritten but still bitten, it almost sound like
Almost pumpin', but it ain't down like
A record's supposed to sound, watch it, it goes around
Records are broken, smashed into the ground
That ain't my melody, brothers keep runnin' up and tellin' me
Others are tryin' to flow smooth and steadily
Potholes are left in my path, then I crash and bruise
Whoever refuse and cruise right past 'em
'Cause I just left to do it for easy forever, death
'Til I get back, you better stay in step
At the speakers, you'll stare, if I was there, your description is
Letters full of poetical messages, this is for the listeners
It's to the listeners
It's to the listeners
You still listenin'?
It's to the listeners1Embed
