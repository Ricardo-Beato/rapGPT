I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
Money, Money, Money by the ton
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
Money, Money, Money by the ton
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it

Roll up and get swoll' up, hold up
How ya gonna play me like a sunkin' dunkin' donut?
I done came a long way to get checks
So give me respect when I get wreck
Or get your motherfuckin' chin checked
Once again, it's your friend outta Oakland
Hoping I can rock the shit to get ya open
Say you're looking for some real shit then catch
A funkified batch, like that!!
Oakland's on the map
2Pac is on the big screen strivin'
Gotta love a nigga for survivin'
I wear a lot of old school jewels
Look how the fools drool, ooohh
Stop lookin at me hard 'cause you're buffer
My nine is buckin' bigger motherfuckers
Turnin' men to suckers
Niggas wanna spark a little ruckus
Better duck 'cause I'll be poppin' them motherfuckers
They wanna throw their hands up, that's tight
Hit em wit' my ain't never had shit left, right
Then hit em wit' the uppercut, duck quick
Shit outta luck, fuckin' stuck with that rough shit
Fuck a pop song, fuck a video, fuck Arsenio
Fuck the radio Do you hear me though?
Give a holla to my niggas in the pen
And my murderous partners wit their Mac 10s
I represent the real 'cause I'm ill, G
Glock cocked 'till the day they kill me
I'm representin'

I got a head (Damn, who did I forget?)
But ain't no screws in it
But ain't no screws in it

I'm a soulja, daddy was a soulja strong
And the struggle must continue so it's on
Raised in a house full of bad motherfuckers
Mad motherfuckers, never had, so we grab
From the sad motherfuckers
Now they know me, the homies
Raised by some crazed ass well paid OG's
Ah shit! Pulled up in a Benzy, snatch
The wheel as I peel off catch
A cocktail, block sale's hit, raise a fist
So they know who make the hit
Can I flip it? I make it wicked as I rip it (Uh)
To get specific: if the shoe fits, then kick it
It's for the gifted, pump your fist if you with it
Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit
Now they wanna ban me (Told ya)
All I wanted to be was a soulja
Bang bang boogie, it's a stick up
Quit now, nigga, eat a dick up
Huh, I'm representin'8Embed
