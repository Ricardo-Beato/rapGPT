1 ContributorTake Your Time (2003) Lyrics
Lil' somethin' special for the ladies out there
On 187.4FM on your dial, here inside the love zone
DJ Twinkleballs, all in your face
Brand new Snoop Dogg, get a load of this

You know how to make me say things I wouldn't normally say
Girl, have a drink (Have a drink), and just think about it
Ain't nobody else for me (Nobody), you've always been there for me
Girl, take your time (Take your time), and just think about it

I figure we can make this thing last
It's all about the future, boo, quit bringin' up the past (Past)
It hurts me like it hurts you, I'll never desеrt you
I hurt you on purpose, but the surface has been scratchеd
It's hard to bring my love back, matter of fact, boy I love that
I'm lookin' for it, tryna find it, pausin' it, rewindin' it
Findin' it, unbelievable, wouldn't even know
Even if I said I love you so, plain irresistible
Sanctionable, let's take it slow (Slow)
I'm tryna be with you, I ain't got nowhere to go
And the way I feel, girl, I think I ought to let you know (Let her know)
I'm through lookin' for a ho'
And like Big Pun and Joe, I don't wanna be a player no more
And that's on the real dough
'Cause I'm feelin' like, uh, gettin' paid
You might also like
You know how to make me say things I wouldn't normally say
Girl, have a drink (Have a drink), and just think about it
Ain't nobody else for me (Nobody), you've always been there for me
Girl, take your time (Take your time), and just think about it

Flashback to the Cadillac with the fat sack
SA's out front, P-Lo stayed in the back
Wasn't nothin' to it, slide through it, get to it
I was so horny, bitch, you never really wanna do it
I guess they my growing pains
I look back on this shit, now I'm knowin' things
Ha, ease to please you, love to kiss you
Hold you and squeeze you, and breathe to you
You know, talkin' on the phone
Holdin' hands, laughin', while I'm walkin' you home
I proceed to love you, believe you
And don't trip 'bout what them other fleas do
Baby-boo, I'd never leave you
'Cause I do need you in my life, forever more
We a perfect combination
And it's built on trust and conversation

You know how to make me say things I wouldn't normally say
Girl, have a drink (Have a drink), and just think about it
Ain't nobody else for me (Nobody), you've always been there for me
Girl, take your time (Take your time), and just think about itEmbed
