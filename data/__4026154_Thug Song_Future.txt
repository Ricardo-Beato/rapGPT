Livin' in the streets, takin’ chances every day
My people hit the spot, my dawg go to trial today
In the plug, they give his ass thirty years straight
One of the goonies got ninety-nine for that murder case
Keep that strap and that tooly, 'cause I know it ain't safe
Smokin’ on Kush, tryna make that pain go away
Throwin' money, can see the tears fallin' from my face
Throwin' money, it's like the tears fallin' down my face
Couldn't see it comin' down my eye, so I had to let the money fly
Couldn’t see it comin’ down my eye, so I had to make the money cry

And this the thug song, we had touch from above
We one the come up now, and it's a new day now, hey
And this the thug song, and this the thug song
And this the thug song, and this the thug song

Trappin with the gang, runnin up that green
Where I don’t pay gold, so you know I took a chance
I done stacked a couple M's, I done lost a couple friends
But I don't give a damn, I swear, I'd do it all again
I done sold a couple drugs, finessed a couple plugs
My nigga asked me if I care, I said, "I don’t give a fuck"
I done bust a couple moves, I bust a couple tools
Ain't shit changed, find me, I'ma bust at you
Pay cash for all my cars, done fucked all of the stars
Who woulda thought a trap boy make it this far?
The hood on my back, the streets show me love
Shout out to all my thug, I do this shit for us
You might also like
And this the thug song, we had touch from above
We one the come up now, and it's a new day now, hey
And this the thug song, and this the thug song
And this the thug song, and this the thug song

Let's toast it up for all my thugs on they way back home
Let's toast it up for all my thugs, my people dead and gone
I wish my nigga Loco was right here to hear my song
I got blood, sweat, and tears inside my tone
If I never got to mention, I'm proud of me
I get more money than a student with a college degree
I pop out, like it's water, and it's starin' to me
My La Familia is deep, you can never see me
I keep designers on my face, 'cause I stay as high as can be
I got some real bad nerves, and I still'll serve
We roll the dice and shake 'em up, and let 'em go off the curb
This for them lil' Mexico niggas, 

And this the thug song, we had touch from above
We one the come up now, and it's a new day now, hey
And this the thug song, and this the thug song
And this the thug song, and this the thug songEmbed
