72 ContributorsRicky Ticky Toc Lyrics
Once you call my name out, things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow just so that
I don't explode, and- have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna
Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Every day it's the same thing, people in this game
Try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us, everybody just wants
To have something to do with that
They all trying to get that stamp, they after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common than we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later, me and Doc had to come, and, uhh-
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was hollering "Fuck Compton"
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head, that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya' don't stopYou might also like31Embed
