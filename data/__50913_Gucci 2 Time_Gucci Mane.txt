25 ContributorsGucci 2 Time Lyrics
It's Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times

Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times

I'm startin' off the day with the paper, the paper
Me and Flockaveli, nigga, ballin' is my major
Seventy-K tucked like I'm robbin', I'm robbin'
Brick Squad bandana in these Robins, these Robins
Me and YG Hootie, he from Compton, that's Bompton
Half a onion, bought it from the game room, that's Thompson
1017 on my face and my necklace
Mob so deep we wish a nigga would disrespect us
Put me in the game, I might score a triple-double
Kush, purp, lean, aw man, they in trouble
Meet me at the Georgia Dome, standin' on a fifty
With fifty on my wristy-wristy, eighty in my Dickies
You might also like
It's Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times

The paper, the paper, I'm 'bout that ('Bout that)
Ferrari black and yellow, got one yellow black (Ooh)
Back to back in 'Raris, who the fuck is that? (It's Gucci)
The Brick Squad boss, anybody get it (Squad)
I got so much money, if I want the bitch (Want the bitch)
I go into my bag, everybody hit it (Woo)
I'm at Club Onyx fuckin' with the strippers (Damn)
I tip 'em, squeeze your nipples, squeeze your nipples (Woo)
I got crazy choppers, crazy choppers
I'll send you to the doctor, to the doctor
All-black Phantom, pulled up the opera (Woo)
Bad white bitch, call her Cindy Lauper

It's Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times
Gucci Gucci two times, say it two times7Embed
