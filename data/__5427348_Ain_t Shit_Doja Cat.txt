Man
This happened one, two, three times too much
These dumb-ass niggas

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did
Listen to your friends
When they said niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did
Listen to your friends
When they said niggas ain't shit, 'cause

Umm, you could say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassin'
Ten-page text, shoulda wrote a book, coulda made a bag
But he broke and he still waitin' 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doin' too much, relax a bit
Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Shoulda known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative
