72 ContributorsFuck Friendz Lyrics
Pawhoo hoo hoo hoo, live from the crazyhouse
I don’t wanna be your man, bitch, (Fuck that) what you crazy
I don’t wanna be your fuckin' man
You stupid, you fuckin' idiot! (Drunk ho)
I wanna be… yo let me fuck that nigga down
What’s that? Ayo, what you doin' with that big ass?
My ghetto love song (Hahaha)
Set it off, set it off! Let’s be friends! Where my niggas at?
Where my niggas, where my niggas, where my niggas at?
All my real niggas (Throw your mothafuckin' hands up!)
Where my niggas, where my niggas?
Hahahaha yeeeah (Let's go, let's go!)
Let’s be friends! (Throw your hands in the air!)
There’s no need to front
(Let’s see you just throw your hands in the air!) Let's be friends!
(Westside in this motherfucker right here, Westside)
(Throw your hands in the air!)

Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye, winkin' my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps, baby? Come get with me and perhaps, lady
You can help me multiply my stacks, baby
Currency seems small, I need companionship
Through with that scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitatin', actin' like yo' shit don't stink?
Check out my diamonds, bitch, every one go bling
This be a thug thing, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my résumé, sippin' on Cristal and Alizé
Smokin' on big weed keyed the Cali way
Don't like trickin', but I'll buy you a 'Fit
I can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree read briefly, they're so cheap
Puttin' bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called comp, who the man?
While I'm tuggin' on your main bitch head
Understand this: ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z!
He broke and I smoke daily—baby, let's be friends!
You might also like
Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? C'mon!)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(All my niggas, where my hoes at?)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes?
Let's be friends! (Where the bitches at?
Where the niggas with money? Where you at, baby?)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends (Cash makin' hoes)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends

I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants, every time you pass
Got me checkin' for you hardcore, starin' and watchin'
Me and you, one on one, picture countless options
Was if prophecy clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, when possess by bodies
Far from a crush, I wanna bust your guts
And touch everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in '9-6? Find tricks in drag
Fuck Dre! Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass!
Back to you, my pretty-ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs, now let me in-between as friends
Let's be friends (Westside, motherfucker, right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(Westside in this motherfucker)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (Westside in this motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(In this motherfucker right here)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends

Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks?
I got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame, my dick or the game?
Bet I screamed Westside when I came (Westside!)
Scream my name ‘cause, baby, it's delicious
Got a weak spot for pretty bitches
Up and down similar to switches
My movement, baby, let your back get into it (into it)
Make it fluid (fluid), in and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high, let me cum inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby, let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player-hatin' niggas, ‘cause they cockblock
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a livin' out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizin' seein' you naked
It's the fuck song so check my record and let's be friends
Where my niggas at? Show me where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at? Thug style!
Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)
(Throw yo' guns in the air!)
Friends… (My ghetto love song!
It goes on and on and on and on)
Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)
(Where my niggas at?)
Friends… (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)
(Where my people at? Let's be…)

Where my people at? Show me where my people at!
Where my people at? Show me where my people at!
All my niggas now, just my niggas come!
Where my niggas at? Just my niggas now!
Be friends, tell me where my niggas at
Be friends, tell me where my bitches at
Be friends, tell me where my people at
Be friends, tell me where my bitches at
Make money, take money, be friends

Let's be friends (Get your cash on! Let's get dough!)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(C'mon, get your cash on!)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (C'mon, get your cash on! Let's get paid!)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(C'mon, get your cash on!)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends

Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!4Embed
