I don't like girls who always in the lime light
I don't like girls who think that I rhyme tight (nah)
I don't like girls who tryin' to be in my life (fuck that)
Let me tell you the kind of girls that I like
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like the ones who like slurpin' (slurpin')
'Cause I like girls who like slurpin'

Work it when you slurp it, make sure that you jerk it
And swallow it and then burp it, once it has been inserted
Maybe I will give you a pat on the back if it is worth it (thanks)
Stick this sword inside your mouth like it was a circus
I wanna Slurpee and sticky when you get jiggy with licking me physically it will be like a paradise (dise)
While you doing that you can put my scrotum inside of your palm and maybe play with them like their a pair of dice (dice)
That'll be nice to have every night I'm sure that I'd be walking around with a happier life
Girl come over here snack on my pipe (But I want chicken)
Bitch beef stick is what you're having aight now shut up
So don't be trying to fight it, open your mouth and let me slide it inside it, but don't be trying to bite it
Or we'll be fighting tonight and then you'll be crying and trying to call the ambulance sirens and I'll just say that you lying (Ha!)

I don't like girls who always in the lime light
I don't like girls who think that I rhyme tight
I don't like girls who tryin' to be in my life
Let me tell you the kind of girls that I like
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like the ones who like slurpin' (slurpin')
'Cause I like girls who like slurpin'
You might also like
Slurp it like you about to finish a soda
And keep on doing it through out the night until it is over
Just don't shake it up a lot or else the fizz will get on ya
Here, my soda is so delicious isn't it Sonya
Oh yes it is, a matter of fact, you can have the rest of it
Let your lips just caress it, and rest against it it's heaven biotch
And you can keep your mouth open 24 hours seven days out the week like your ass was 7-Eleven biotch
My shit is alright, full of caffeine keep you up all night
Make your life all bright
Don't know what you heard, shit
You feeling thirsty, you can get first dibs 'cause baby girl you deserve this
More than anyone slurp it soon as your Henny's done
When your done you can try some of the little homies when he comes
Just sip it up like he don't give a fuck don't be giving up
Then I will zip it up, when you want more you can hit me up

I don't like girls who always in the lime light
I don't like girls who think that I rhyme tight
I don't like girls who tryin' to be in my life
Let me tell you the kind of girls that I like
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like the ones who like slurpin' (slurpin')
'Cause I like girls who like slurpin'
Just like Clinton does, sure that every nigga does
She don't want to do it then give her something to get her buzzed
Now it's on, "Hey can I try some?" Hell nah, that's how these niggas get pounded on
Homie, only for women who love sippin' and lickin' and ticklin' and jigglin a big one up in â€˜em that's not for boys man
And don't be stepping to be, or you will definitely be resting in peace if your swinging that way, I ain't your boyfriend
Girls, you ain't got to get all greedy with each other trying to throw it down
'Cause there is enough Slurpee to go around
Got brains? Use them, I got enough to give you some, you some, you some, you some
I hope I didn't leave anyone out
And if I did put here stick this straw end up in your mouth
It's so tasty baby isn't it?
I don't see how any women out there could get sick of it (Nope!)

I don't like girls who always in the lime light
I don't like girls who think that I rhyme tight
I don't like girls who tryin' to be in my life
Let me tell you the kind of girls that I like
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like the ones who like slurpin' (slurpin')
'Cause I like girls who like slurpin'1Embed
