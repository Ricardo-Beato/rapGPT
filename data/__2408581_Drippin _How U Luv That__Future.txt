40 ContributorsDrippin (How U Luv That) Lyrics
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
DJ EscoMoeCity, the coolest DJ on the motherfuckin' planet
Ayy, ayy, ayy

Got a money counter on me, baby, how you love that?
I'm a big timer, baby, how you love that?
Got a money counter on me, baby, how you love that?
Got bottles on me right now, how you love that?
I'm drippin' on 'em, baby, how you love that?
I'm drippin' on 'em, baby, how you love that?
I'm drippin' on 'em now, how you love that?
I'm drippin' on 'em now, how you love that?

I'm drippin' flavor, you just a traitor
No sports agent, I am a player
I'm at the Four Seasons like I'm on vacation
Tryna count some paper everyday I wake up
I can't get no sleep, I'm runnin' these bands way up
Louboutins on my feet gettin' laced up
Hublot wrapped around my wrist, it's perfect timer
Hublot wrapped around my wrist, I'm tryna find her
I got fine bitches on me just like Chyna
Here's a chance for you to prove it girl, line up
Ain't no pressure, got a drapper bustin' diamonds
If you care about her, put her in designer
You might also like
Shawty want a taste of the high life
Shawty want a taste of the high life
Tussin' up right now, how you love that?
We toastin' up right now, how you love that?
I could pay your rent right now, how you love that?
I could pay your bills right now, how you love that?
I buy you a brand new car, how you love that?
I'm standin' on the bar, how you love that?
We came in VIP, how you love that?
We came in VIP, how you love that?
Got a money counter on me baby, how you love that?
I'm drippin' on 'em now, how you love that?

Foreign automobiles, spinnin' these wheels, yeah-yeah-yeah
Take the top off a seal, take the top off a seal and pour it
Make me some Codeine I want it, make me some bars I want it
I got a feelin' she want me like I want her

Shawty want a taste of the high life
Shawty want a taste of the high life
Toastin' up right now, how you love that?
We toastin' up right now, how you love that?
Actavis and red, how you love that?
Actavis and red, how you love that?
Ace of Spade Rosé, how you love that?
Ace of Spade Rosé, how you love that?
You need that drip, you wanna drip
I show you drip, I'mma get on that drip
Like to drip, they like to drip
You wanna drip, you know we drip
I'm drippin' on 'em, baby, how you love that?
I'm drippin' on 'em, baby, how you love that?
I'm drippin' on 'em now, how you love that?
I'm drippin' on 'em now, how you love that?22Embed
