8 ContributorsFly Shit Lyrics
Young Lloyd
Aye Holiday we got one
Zone 6, East Atlanta stand up
Aye baby you know how much this motherfuckin car cost?
Don't spill nothing in my shit

I ain't makin' this shit up, ho I ain't Maybeline
I got some shit off in my cup that's gonna make ya lean
I told er cool it, please don't make a scene
Cause I'm a fool with it, this is every day for me
She want that fly shit (fly shit, fly shit)
Expensive clothes and diamonds (diamonds, diamonds)
Just remember you in my shit (my shit my shit)
If you don't like the rules then bye bitch (bye bitch, bye bitch)

Higher than a pilot, fresher than a stylist
You a bad bitch, I'm a take you to a island
Aggressive watch game, yeah my diamonds real violent
If you a grown lady then why you actin all childish?
Bought a new Bentley, I don't even gotta drive it
Parked outside so I jumped inside it
Lights frog-eyed'd, the seats cow hide'd
Private jet flying, smoking kush with the pilot
Head so good that it keeps me smiling
Forgiato rims so I keep on sliding
So icey boss so I keep on diamonds
And Too Short told me to keep on rhyming
2 Pac taught me to keep on riding
Biggie Smalls says yo mama be cryin
Owe me money and you keep on lyin
I'm a grab my gun, I'm a keep on firin
Ball so hard I can touch the sky
I can't even lie, I don't wear levi's
Goon came in and you took up yo chain
Fuck them niggas I'm a keep on mine
Your girl so fly and she gonna on wine
I ain't gonna tell you, nigga one time
Slide in with me, you can come in free
Or you can stand and freeze in that long ass line
You might also like
I ain't makin' this shit up, ho I ain't Maybeline
I got some shit off in my cup that's gonna make ya lean
I told er cool it, please don't make a scene
Cause I'm a fool with it, this is every day for me
She want that fly shit (fly shit, fly shit)
Expensive clothes and diamonds (diamonds, diamonds)
Just remember you in my shit (my shit my shit)
If you don't like the rules then bye bitch (bye bitch, bye bitch)

Riding down to crest and the Bentley Mulsanne
Little hand choppa and the big weed bong
Born by myself, I don't need no one
If you don't got no enemies, make you some
Sometime money can make you dumb
Money on yo head, better get yo gun
Broke ass nigga can't even make bond
I don't trust that bitch, money make er cum
Flyin to the nigga, tryna go to the prom
Smokin on kush like fuck my lungs
None of these hoes can't meet my mom
At the end of the day you want a suck her son
Leather jacket on so I feel like Fonzi
I ain't never ever had so much fun
500$ gun and a million on jewels
And I wet yo ass up like you jumped in the pool
Feds wanna get me just like Ja Rule
Five bad bitches, that's deja-vu
Wutchu gonna do with them scraps on you?
And kicks so fly, got a birds eye view
Gucci 2 times, 2 times times 2
All this money can't fit in these Tru's
This a T neck so my neck hurt too
But I pity the fool tryna try my crew
I ain't makin' this shit up, ho I ain't Maybeline
I got some shit off in my cup that's gonna make ya lean
I told er cool it, please don't make a scene
Cause I'm a fool with it, this is every day for me
She want that fly shit (fly shit, fly shit)
Expensive clothes and diamonds (diamonds, diamonds)
Just remember you in my shit (my shit my shit)
If you don't like the rules then bye bitch (bye bitch, bye bitch)3Embed
