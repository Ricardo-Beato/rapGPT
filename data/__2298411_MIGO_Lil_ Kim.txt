5 ContributorsMIGO Lyrics
This is vibe
Yeah!

Hit my migo, tell him send another one
Hit my migo, tell him send another one
'Cause I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain

If I hit my migo he gon' send me kilos
I'm gon' quarterback it, call me Timmy Tebow
I smoke organic, bitch, I roll 
We got all bricks like Shaq got the free throw

Hit my migo, tell him send another one
Hit my migo, tell him send another one
'Cause I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain

You might also like
Hit my migo, tell him send another one
Hit my migo, tell him send another one
'Cause I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain

I could build a mansion, I got hella bricks
I am not to be fucked with, I'm celibate
Put yo' eyes on yo' lips, bitch, watch yo' mouth
I cook it up in the South like waffle house
I'm the connect, I thought I told ya
I got a street full of soldiers
Go ahead man, they ready for whatever
Pussy like monsoon, can you stand the weather?
Aye, hit my migo, tell him send another one
Hit my migo, tell him send another one
Whippin' and flippin' that work
I twerk to these squares
You know I swallow it all
He lickin' my ass just like he a dog
No wholesale you resell, my shit cost, no retail
I get it through mail, pack it, ship it, I sell
School bus, Chanel suits, trench coats and rain boots
Made by Balmain, I can't stand the rain
Hit my migo, tell him send another one
Hit my migo, tell him send another one
'Cause I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rainEmbed
