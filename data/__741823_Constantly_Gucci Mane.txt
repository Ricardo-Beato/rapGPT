24 ContributorsConstantly Lyrics
Hello?
Yeah?
What up?
Nothing
You dry
Its 3 o'clock in the morning out here
How? Ah its 3 hour difference doe, never mind

You're runnin' through my mind
I think about you all the time
You motivate my grind
You shine, I shine, we shine
What you've done to me
Girl come have some fun with me
What you want from me?
Please don’t get scared, don’t run from me
Walking on the beach
Damn, my lil' mama a freak
Seven days out the week
Yeah, we fuckin' constantly

I'm a star, being humble now, parkin' rental cars
Ballin' hard, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, with my broad
Constantly crossin' the country
Constantly gettin' the money
You niggas hatin' constantly
But I don't take it personally
Thirty G's a verse from me
Your baby daddy work for me
And I am not ashamed to say
And I think 'bout my family constantly
You might also like
Your friend constantly hittin' my phone, constantly
These feds steady tappin' my phone, think they onto me
I be gettin' money, spendin' money, constantly
Continue to hate on me, swear that shit don't bother me, ayy
Smoke OG, no bubbly, ayy
And I smoke that shit constantly, ayy
I fuck hoes constantly, ayy
And I rock shows constantly, ayy, ayy
Baby, why you jokin'? I don't play
These niggas jokes, I'm out of space and out my space
Every time she whine, I'm like, “Ok”
I don't wanna hear that shit, not today
Let me check my watch
Twenty-four in a day, and it's twelve up in my watch
Ain't no time to waste, got some cake to make
She wanna see me, I told that bitch, "Another day"

I'm a star, being humble now, parkin' rental cars
Ballin' hard, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, with my broad
Constantly crossin' the country
Constantly gettin' the money
You niggas hatin' constantly
But I don't take it personally
Thirty G's a verse from me
Your baby daddy work for me
And I am not ashamed to say
And I think 'bout my family constantly8Embed
