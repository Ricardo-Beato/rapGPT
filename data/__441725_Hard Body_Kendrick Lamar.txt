17 ContributorsHard Body Lyrics
That’s where you headed boy, to pine oil heaven. I'mma get that gun, and then I'mma get that money. I don’t believe you got it in you, Jake. I'mma go get it right now (gunshot) Oh shit, awwwww you motherfucker! The next one will kill you. Ohh, son of a bitch. You shot me in the ass

I never been a bitch in my life, I never ran from a fight
I was told when niggas bark you should bite
And these puppies ain’t eatin' enough Pedigree to scare something
They play with the word gangster til some lead dumpin
Until the ambulance coming pressin' on they chest
Calf and stomach, you grabbin' the hand of a woman
I never took the stand, snitched on my man and came back home Like it was nothin', actin' like I ain’t do somethin' wrong
Fuck it, and if I did i would look 'em in the face
Tell hop out that bucket and spray
Tell 'em to make sure they hit my head and my waist
Tell them to circle round the block twice in case
Shit, cement pump in my veins, hard body to the death
Scream fuck the world with a capital F
Everybody extinct, it’s just me and my niggas left
And this is how we think

No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
You might also like
And when I say hard body, homie, not in a physical
You either born with it or real niggas around real kids
And it’s passed on like a ritual, not sworn in it
You ain’t livin' it because you put it in sentences
And you ain’t givin' it if it’s ten percent, it gotta be a hundred
Walkin' down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it?
I got a hundred shots for any one of you blood clots
Motherfucker, we will fuck ya
Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker
I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid
We lift something out the trunk that got a kickstand with it
You either fall now or stand with it
You either crawl now or get laid down
Think about it, I’m only giving you one minute
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you’re too late
Motherfucker, meet your fate

No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Look between my eyes
You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires
And my burner from the four fifth which is the four five
Which is that ninety-five Jordan shit
Jordans on your feet, we gon' take them shits
Put them on our feet and reshape them shits
Now don’t they look sweet?
Wear em for a minute, sell them the next week
That’s good profit, y'all ain’t thinkin' logic
You talkin' ass backwards like criss cross pockets
Mel Gibson, you just actin'
Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to target practice
Teach you niggas a lesson or two
Won’t you listen when a grown man is lecturin' you?
Cause any weapon will do in the process of fuckin' up you, nigga
You rappers ain’t built like us
Y'all just lift a lot of weights and look tough
We see through that, we shoot through anything that’s buff
And we ain’t thinkin' about handcuffs
The police runnin' from us, we so hard bodied, trust

No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tongue tissue ass niggas man, ay wait, we say, either go hard or go home, tha- tha- tha- that’s what we go by, either stand for something or fall for anything nigga, bite that, o- open your mouth, bite that go ahead, you’re suicidal
Yeah, , oh fuck, I’m winning anyway, I’m winning, I’m winning any mother fuckin' way, I can’t lose3Embed
