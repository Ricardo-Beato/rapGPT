8 ContributorsTransition Lyrics
Is really just making a transition of being a street hustler nigga to like a quote on quote star
Jahlil Beats, holla at me

Me and my homeboys walked up in the strip club
37 deep, Long Beach, 20 crip, cous'
I could really give a fuck about a bitch, cous'
We in this motherfucker tryna hit a lick, cous'
Pouring drinks in a bitch face, tryna pop a bottle with a model
I bought a whole case
Glasses up, asses up
They paying homage to a nigga like a 
VIP scene looking like a massacre
This little bitch got mad 'cause I wouldn't dance with her
It's all a setup, I sat up, get up, and listen to the 
Balls up, real nigga, punk bitch move back
Let me get my vape on
Don't trip, super crip with my cape on
Bacon, how much am I gon' take on?
It don't matter at all, no ladder to fall
You either the bat or the ball
Through the heart of it all, true heart of it all
Sipping on this liquor, tryna hit this lick up
And when it's done, I make the pick up, kick up more dust
Word on the street's the shit had to be us
Now they wanna see us, so we LBC ya
I take off the  and I spin it on my rear
Yeah motherfucker, we up
Shoe box money with two Glocks on me
In case y'all put the motherfucking pigs on me
The little homie with the shit, homie
Tiny cous', big cous' look stoney
All he ever wanted was the money, but we'll take it all
And we never hesitate to break it off
So cold on the pole, baby shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off (shake it, shake it)
Yeah, shake it off, shake it off (take it off)
I see you get money, more dollars
No money, no pussy, no habla (no habla Ingles)
I see you get money, more dollars (money, money, money, money)
No money, no pussy, no habla (no habla Ingles)
Yeah
So when you see a nigga sitting up in a ace of diamonds
Or you may see me 
Wherever you see me at, you gotta know and understand
It's not a trick, it may be a lick
Haha, yeah nigga
See, you want the honey
All we want is the money
Believe that
Gangsta (my nigga we so motherfucking)
Gangsta (my nigga we so motherfucking)
Gangsta (my nigga we so motherfucking)
Gangsta (my nigga we so motherfucking)
Gangsta
