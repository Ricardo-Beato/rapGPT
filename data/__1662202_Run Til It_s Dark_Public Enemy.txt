"It's time to start running!"

Bomb drop, designed as a warning shot
Listen, 'cause some of us don't check statistics, kick it
40 or so million blacks in America
How can 13.5% of the population be scaring ya
Survey says, 88% of us cites are black
95% of America's suburbs are white
But 10% of blacks are 50% white
But post racial politics tricks and lessens the fight
Education economics enforcement of law
The gaps the ratio even worse than before
Obama, baby, the truth is America will show you the door
Survey says

Run 'til it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
You might also like
"Run, run"
"Ain't nobody talkin' when I'm talkin', fellas"
"Run, nigg, run nigg"

Run 'til it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark

Truth hurts
Makes me curse in this Fight The Power church
Stole history from everybody
Sellin' lies at the tea party, shame
Survey says peeps fed up with the feds
40 acres to 40 yards to 40 feet
Might as well be sleep, down laid out six feet
Deep respect, sot yet
You gotta give it to get, survey says
You gotta learn to earn way beyond your check
Lovable as huggin' a bull, that's some bull
Negativity gotta lot a pull, what's the use?
If you tie the noose and love the abuse?
Hanging yourself while you loving the loot
DJ Lord, knock it out the park
Survey says, survey says
Run 'til it's dark
Run 'til it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's dark
Run till it's dark, run 'til it's darkEmbed
