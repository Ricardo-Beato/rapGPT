28 ContributorsKush With Them Beans Lyrics
GBE baby
Glory Gang
Sosa, bitch
O'Block
Bang

I’m on that kush with them beans, countin' all this green
All us get money, bitch, 'cause we the money team
We got 40s on our waist, 30s in them things
I’ma let this hammer blow, bitch, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I got all the shells on me, bitch, I'm never lonely
I got all this money on me, bitch, I'm never hungry
I got all these diamonds on me, your bitch waitin' on me
Say you wanna get like me, keep grinding, homie

I’ma go to the mall, I’ma buy that bitch
I’ma hop in my 'Rari and I’ma ride that bitch
See my truck sittin' on 4's, can’t ride on no lows
And bitch my pockets on swoll, blow hundreds on my nose
I put Fendi on my belt, Robin all in my jeans
I don't wanna go to sleep, so bitch, I don't do that lean
Big knots in my pocket, I don’t carry no wallet
Sneak dissin' us, stop it, and go get you some money
I love bankrolls, I don't love these hoes
Never snitchin' on bros, keep my mouth closed
High off that Earth, I don’t smoke that purp
I don’t smoke that mid and I don’t smoke that dirt
You might also like
I’m on that kush with them beans, countin' all this green
All us get money, bitch, 'cause we the money team
We got 40s on our waist, 30s in them things
I’ma let this hammer blow, bitch, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I got all the shells on me, bitch, I'm never lonely
I got all this money on me, bitch, I'm never hungry
I got all these diamonds on me, your bitch waitin' on me
Say you wanna get like me, keep grinding, homie

I got all this kush on me, all these bitches on me
Steady textin' my phone, leave me alone please
I'm busy countin' this green, all 100s and 50s
And steady I'm throwin' money with the Slutty Boyz
We the Glory Boyz, all the bitches know we
All the bitches on we, and all these bitches want we
Plus we be throwin' money, we be straight stuntin'
Fredo off the molly then shoot up the party
600 on some Mikes 'cause I don't like them spikes
And I don't do that Molly, I be high as a kite
Come on O'Block, and you gon' lose yo life
300 for life, on the block with the pipes

I’m on that kush with them beans, countin' all this green
All us get money, bitch, 'cause we the money team
We got 40s on our waist, 30s in them things
I’ma let this hammer blow, bitch, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I got all the shells on me, bitch, I'm never lonely
I got all this money on me, bitch, I'm never hungry
I got all these diamonds on me, your bitch waitin' on me
Say you wanna get like me, keep grinding, homie2Embed
