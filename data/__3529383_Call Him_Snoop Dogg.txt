Excuse me
Excuse me real quick, thank you
Hello, hello
Yes, yes
Hey um, how ya doin' mam?
I, I'm sorry I, I don't have it now
But I was prayin' that maybe...

Wait a minute yeah
I got caught up in some mess
Thought I knew what I was doin'
Got my friends and family stressin'
Don't know how to keep this train movin'
Rent man want his money, light bill is due
And I don't know nobody I can run to
So now I'm callin' on Jesus
And I know he'll bring me through
Woah yeah, now I'm right down on my knees
Tryna figure out how, you brought me through many 
That I'm callin' on ya now
Jesus, Jesus
Cause I know where my health comes from
So I gotta call ya with the songs in my life
 go by in the middle of the night
Somebody call him
Jesus, Jesus
Somebody sing it
Just like you mean it
Call him like you need him
Call him like you know him
Somebody sing it
You might also like
Call him when my times get hard, call him when my days get rough
Lookin' for my blessin' get him down in my heart
Givin' me a brand new start, every time I call him
I don't really know about you, but I know what I've been through
Every time I call him ain't no tellin' what God can do
He did it for me, he'll do it for you
It ain't a problem, call on Jesus right away
He will hear you when you pray
And he'll brighten up your day
Woah yeah, callin' him right now
Cause I love, I love, I love to call him
I love to call him
How sweet the name, how sweet the name
I call him when I need him, call him cause I love him
I love the name, Jesus
I dare somebody to call him
Sing it, Jesus
It's alright to call him, come out and call him
Somebody call him, just like you need, just like you want him
Somebody sing it

Jesus, when I'm down and out
Jesus, turn my life around
Jesus, make me scream and shout
Jesus, put my feet on solid ground
Jesus, I know you care for me
Jesus, you're always there for me
Jesus, gave me victory
Jesus, yes, he'll set you free
Jesus, Lord I testify
Jesus, you've been good to me
Jesus, always there for me
Jesus, yes, I know you care for me
Jesus, I was lost but now I'm found
Jesus, cause you turned my life around
Jesus, and I love you more today than I did yesterday
Call him when my days are rough
Call him when my times are hard
I'm lookin' through, glisten, I'm lookin' through my, glisten
Call on him in the midnight
When the stars are too tight
When your paper is funny
Somebody call him
To watch over yo' family, to bless yo' kids
Somebody say Jesus, somebody say Jesus
Say Jesus, say Jesus
Sing it, hit 'em wit' it
Call him when my times get bad
When I'm feelin' low and sad
He will come and lift me up
He will come and fill my cup
The name down is above, every name
Just call on him, and he will answer
I said, he will answer
Somebody know, what I'm talkin' 'bout
Just put yo' hands together one time
Jesus, somebody call him
Somebody sing itEmbed
