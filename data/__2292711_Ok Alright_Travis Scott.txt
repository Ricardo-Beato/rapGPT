They ain't want to let us in but they had to

Zona Man in the building

Should've never let us niggas in

Should've-should've-should've never let us niggas in
Okay, okay, okay

Let's get this shit lit poured right
Need my drugs alright
Call my bitch up, she gon' suck this dick four ways
Four ways, now it's time to pay
Need my money now, not tomorrow, need that shit today
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Now it's bombs away
Bitches kissing bitches while my niggas serve 'em candy cane
Okay, okay, bouncing on La Flame, put you up on game
Teach you mix a little, how to dab a little
Them bitches scared, them bitches scared, ah, yeah

Bottom bitch say ho
Know you on top when the top get floored
Crib where the cop won't go
Rollie on bling bling, neck-neck on ice
Tell a bitch, "Get right," make a nigga miss that flight
Can a nigga hit that twice
Should have never let us niggas in
Got my first M 2012
'Nother hundred K in the mail
Free another homie on bail
Money low, her pussy gon' sell
Tryna tell you money ain't sh—
When you tried to tell me water won't whip
When you tried to say this quarter won't flip
Since Snoop who the other rich crip
How Groovy get the Pringle man chip
Walkin' with a twenty-yard clip
Walkin' while a real nigga limp
Black nigga green grass no golf
So on turn the satellite off from the set
Feel like I died on that cross, hang on
Okay, okay, (yeah) okay
Already know it's gon' be alright
Way we going up we might be all night
Okay, okay
Now we gon' blow like the wind
Should've never let us niggas in
Okay, okay, okay
Should've never let them niggas in
Should've never, should've never let them niggas in
Should've never let them niggas in
Should've-should've-should've never let us niggas in
Should've never let us niggas in
Should've-should've-should've never let us niggas in
Okay, okay

Alright, alright, alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright
(Take the long way home)
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Jacques was born April 30, ayy
Doctor said he won't be home in thirty days
He gon' be alright, alright, alright, alright
Mama said her son gon' be a gift
Mama said her son gon' be the shit
He gon' be alright, alright, alright, alright

Will it be alright, alright, alright, alright?
Feel like I'ma need me a sip
Feel like I'ma need me a bitch
Make me feel alright, alright, alright, alright

There's blood on your face
Uh, salt on your skin

Scrape a little off the top
