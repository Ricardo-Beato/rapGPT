21 ContributorsDeeper Than the Ocean Lyrics

I put spikes around my jacket and I'm strapped up with the ratchet
I'm chasin' after paper, I became a savage
My nigga set my nigga up, the game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside the Escalade and crash it
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean

Leather jackets, no motorcycle
I'm spiked up like a bad drink
9 to 3, that good supreme
With all the stress to blow a gas tank
I work hard and it came out
I turnt up and turnt ya bitch out
Then I went from dead broke to layin' up in a penthouse
There are no secrets when you leakin'
I woke up this evenin'
And I seen a demon
I'm on that pure codeine and
Tryna clear my thoughts
Niggas mourn for my pain
All they see is fame and what it bring
I paid dues, graduated from finesse school
I showed and proved, I never lose
I'm too smart, I should've went to Harvard
Drinking out the bottle, holdin' my revolver
You might also like
I put spikes around my jacket and I'm strapped up with the ratchet
I'm chasin' after paper, I became a savage
My nigga set my nigga up, the game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside the Escalade and crash it
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean

Takin' three drugs at one time, duckin' one time
Can you niggas stop hating on Future for one time?
I commit a million crimes
That ain't enough for you
I'mma sell a million rhymes
All that shit I been through
I was grindin' hard
Niggas tried to hold me back
They ain't wanna see me with the plug
They ain't wanna see with the sack
I got it
It worked out
I kept loyal
I set standards
Now I'm royal
Niggas tried to take some paper
Now he gotta take his life
Till we get the screaming
I can't sleep right
Niggas'll put a hit on your head
Now you walkin' around with a price
Nigga ain't make it to see it
Im gon' be alright
I put spikes around my jacket and I'm strapped up with the ratchet
I'm chasin' after paper, I became a savage
My nigga set my nigga up, the game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside the Escalade and crash it
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean11Embed
