13 ContributorsNever Been This High Lyrics
Yeah, I ain’t never been this high
You ain’t never been this high

I been fly since my baby pictures
Alligator on my shirt I been too consistent
I had a beeper in the kindergarten with a gerry curl
And I always got the pretty girls
I’m shinin like Vvs’s I was born shinin’
Matter of fact I should’ve been a diamond
My left wrist Aquafina and these girls im with from Argentina
Body flooded up with ice name a rapper cleaner
Came in photogenics sky ain’t the limit for me
Turnt myself to a astronaut, if you believe you can achieve
I want ya spot homie numero uno
And I brought a check with me bigger than a sumo
Blood Sweat Tears inside this rap as I flow
I know some niggas dead and gone want the best for me
And I know some niggas living praying for the worst for me
I seen darker days I know this ain’t the end for me
That’s why every chance I get cuz I’mma give em hell
Me and my niggas we the last real niggas left
Me and my niggas we the realest niggas left

It’s like my body made of diamonds, I can’t stop shinin’
I ain’t never been this high (I ain’t never been this high)
I ain’t never been this high (Man I ain’t never been this high)
I’m shinin’ over everybody around me (I’m shinin’ over every body)
You ain’t never been this high (You ain’t never been this high)
You ain’t never been this high (I bet you ain’t been this high)

International future don’t follow me follow my footsteps
Every pair of Jordan’s done came out I had em ‘fore they hit the shelf
Air Force One’s I prolley have 2.000 left
I ain’t gave away I’m donating Ralph Lauren
I had every pair of skippers from the green to orange
Yellow Blue White three stripes Adidas suits
All day I dream about selling dope like shootin’ hoops
One day you dreamin’ then you wake up to reality
First you lose your heart then your true friends disappear
I was already shinin’ fore I got here
I told myself I’ll get my feet off ground I’m goin’ outta here
I’m taking some people I never would thought even be here
Everything I went thru it’s a purpose why I’m still here
Hard work perservere keep them people in your ear and them people in your rear
Me and my niggas we the last real niggas here

It’s like my body made of diamonds, I can’t stop shinin’
I ain’t never been this high (I ain’t never been this high)
I ain’t never been this high (Man I ain’t never been this high)
I’m shinin’ over everybody around me (I’m shinin’ over every body)
You ain’t never been this high (You ain’t never been this high)
You ain’t never been this high (I bet you ain’t been this high)Embed
