I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroke

So she can get a sensual seduction
So I can get a sensual seduction
So we can get a sensual seduction
So I can get a sensual seduction

She might be with him but she's thinking 'bout me, me, me
We don't go to the mall, we don't go out to eat, eat, eat
All that we ever do is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Smoke us a cigarette, then go back to sleep, sleep, sleep
'Cause we done got a

Sensual seduction
So I can get a sensual seduction
So we can get a sensual seduction
So I can get a sensual seduction

I was all in da club, havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all in the bar, wind drift up, Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor, now
With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips
You so right I'm gon' beat
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shh"
See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love-faces
But it wasn't no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption
Bust-Bust-Bust-Bust one
Bust-Bust-Bust-Bust one
Sensual seduction
Bust-Bust-Bust-Bust one
Bust-Bust-Bust-B-Bust-Bust-B-Bust one
Sensual seduction, seduction, seduction
Bust-Bust-Bust-Bust one
Bust-Bust-Bust-Bust one
Sensual seduction
Bust-Bust-Bust-Bust one
Bust-Bust-Bust-B-Bust-Bust-B-Bust one
Sensual seduction

Sensual seduction
So I can get a sensual seduction
So we can get a sensual seduction
So I can get a sensual seduction
