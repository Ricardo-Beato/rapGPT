31 ContributorsPlay with Fire LyricsBitch, yeah, ha
Compton most wanted, haunted by the ghost of the dead
Climbing out the casket, with a bullet in the head
All blue, all red, smothers every corner
Catch 'em while they're young like the symptoms of pneumonia
Good 'ol California, killa' California
Where the violence lives, and the peace remains homeless
Killers off the leash, at the mouth, they be foaming
Mad dog mad dog, my goonies be some mad dogs
I'm in the booth zoning
Like 28 grams, of the good yams
Fiends line up in the morning
I'm cloning, greatness
My words made of fire like I'm rhyming about satan
I could burn through some braces
If I had 'em
This is the return of the dragon
I'm not talking about, Bruce Lee
I'm talking about, true heat
And it look like you got cold feet
Step into the flame and I might rekindle your name
(laughing)
Point blank range, as I take aim, at success
Put a bullet in the brain, then one more, in the chest
I'm not thinking about no vest, that is not a factor
I rip through that like I rip through a rapper
I'm not a rapper, I am a raptor
Dinosaur climbing on, everything that I perform
Mayhem, chaos, they pray i, fall
Victim of a fight, which is a gunslinging brawl
But I'm all in all aware, that I'm rare
Like a flying saucer hovin' through the air
Kendrick don't have a spare, meaning there's
No two alike, you can bet it, and I guarantee I'm right
Like a freeway exit, I hope you get the message
Before your T-Mobile lose service
And donâ€™t log off AIM on purpose, you nervous
Ain't you, I'm ready to spank you
Discipline the disobedient hang 'em like Willy Lynch
Don't fuck with me
You might also likeI'm a furnace, burning, turn this mothafucka' inside out like
Daddy mac, mac, daddy's back with a brand new bag
And I'm talking about, mo' money pussy and pistols
Students please get out your pencils
I'm about to break down the principles of the game
Don't complain because, it could be much worse
Whenever you took an L, know that, you could be taking a hearse
Ask you first, don't trust no skirt because bitches are the biggest liars
You playing with that you playing with fire
Burn (echoes)
Straight from the belly of the beast
Break it to the police
Said he put it on me
I'm a ride til my wheels fall off with a G
Ride with the P, 89 creep
On him like a ninja, you entered the warzone
Your home Get bombed on, like an iraqi, and the policy
A guerilla warfare, that nothing is fair
We playin for keeps, no food no sleep
I'm a warrior the coroner going to have to come and get him
Put him under the streets, and I guarantee
I hit 'em where it hurts, I'm a lurk where he sleeps
His alarm clock beep, I be right there
Gun then knife, dead kids, dead wife
Dead bedrock head shot, I'm a hit him twice
Then clear out the block, until there's no mo' life there
Top dawg ENT, bitch we right here
We ain't runnin'
We be gunnin'
Niggas talk alot but they don't say nothin'
Chop 'em up, slice 'em up, he a cooked onion
Shake 'em down, break 'em down, throw 'em in a dungeon
Don't wanna brawl with 5-6 hog
I'm a beast when I bark, every skyship fall
Ground shall break, part the seas and the greatest lakes
Anarchy is taking place, turn gorillas to bathing apes
I'm a gorilla in every state
Your opinion don't mean shit mind yo business
Before I give your mind a business
Ask matadors I ain't bullshittin'
Bitches
