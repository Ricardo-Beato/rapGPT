15 ContributorsDoo Wop Freestyle Lyrics
Ayo, I know these niggas don't like me
But I don't like none of ya'll niggas, you know what I'm saying?
50 cent, 9-9, motherfucking Doo Wop
Volume 3, take it however the fuck you wanna take it
Faggot ass niggas (50 Cent show these niggas how to rock)

Yo, they shot that boy down like a dog in the street
Left him smelly, man fuck that, roll 'em over, take that Pelle Pelle
You ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
Not even Puff and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm saying this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son, I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rapping niggas dying to shine
And I'm tired of fiends asking for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punchline from me may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down before I make change
Yo, the sale went stale, caught 'em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man indictment, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an O.Z
My man brought 'em to me, see he ain't really know, B
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just trying to prop to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him O.Z.'s then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-d's -- damn man, I O.D
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holding the heat
Po-po walking to beat, we burning L's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over, I can't believe it, damn it's over
Feds seized the Six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rolling in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
.380 six-shot Glock top loader
Keep it in my waist, son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga, so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long
But it feel like a motherfucking marathon
You might also like
Come on, bounce, nigga, bounce
Wop the reason why y'all motherfuckers say bounce, bitch
Niggas, niggas don't set trends, niggas just jump on dicks
That's why they Bloods and Crips now3Embed
