Ayy, bang bang
I need a S-O-L-D-I-E-R
We was goin' hard like Mardi Gras
He thought he was hard, thought he was

I need a soldier
One to keep mouth closed if shit go down
I need a soldier
One to hop in my car, let's ride around
I need a soldier
Freak up in the sheets, outside smoke loud
I need a soldier
When we havin' sex, moan, yeah I'm so loud
I need a soldier
Baby girl, you're wild, girl, chill out (Need a soldier)
I need a soldier
Don't turn up, go sit your dumb ass down (I need a soldier)
I need a soldier
Come outside any day, at night doin' work (I need a soldier)
Can you be my soldier?
No matter what I do you can't go hurt (Will you be my soldier? Soldier)

S-O-L-D-I-E-R
I'm off the trees, bitch, I see stars
L-O-L, he thought he was hard
Tried to take my bitch but she plea her part
She don't like busters, she don't like suckers
She don't like niggas, leave 'em with their mothers
Police come, she ain't sayin' nothin'
I know that I can trust her, don't know if I can love her
O-P-P's come, I ain't sprayin' nothin'
She so quick to bust 'em, she so quick to touch 'em
C-O-P-S come, we won't stay for nothin'
We so quick to dust 'em, we so quick to dub 'em
You might also like
I need a soldier
One to keep mouth closed if shit go down
I need a soldier
One to hop in my car, let's ride around
I need a soldier
Freak up in the sheets, outside smoke loud
I need a soldier
When we havin' sex, moan, yeah I'm so loud
I need a soldier
Baby girl, you're wild, girl, chill out (Need a soldier)
I need a soldier
Don't turn up, go sit your dumb ass down (I need a soldier)
I need a soldier
Come outside any day, at night doin' work (I need a soldier)
Can you be my soldier?
No matter what I do you can't go hurt (Will you be my soldier? Soldier)

I think I need me a Navy Seal
I need 'bout six mill' for a deal
Need a bitch with a good head and crazy skill
I know I'm brazy, I can show you what brazy is
So just fuck me but sex appeal up in them Hills
I know I'm from Chiraq but now I live in them Hills
You went through my phone, now you mad, lil' lady, chill
I be high as fuck I don't know who the lady is
Don't turn up, you don't need bill, you need gears
Smokin' on this damn loud, think that I need years
I need a soldier, credited for the kills in the field
I need a soldier, ready for the steel in the deal
I need a soldier
One to keep mouth closed if shit go down
I need a soldier
One to hop in my car, let's ride around
I need a soldier
Freak up in the sheets, outside smoke loud
I need a soldier
When we havin' sex, moan, yeah I'm so loud
I need a soldier
Baby girl, you're wild, girl, chill out (Need a soldier)
I need a soldier
Don't turn up, go sit your dumb ass down (I need a soldier)
I need a soldier
Come outside any day, at night doin' work (I need a soldier)
Can you be my soldier?
No matter what I do you can't go hurt (Will you be my soldier? Soldier)2Embed
