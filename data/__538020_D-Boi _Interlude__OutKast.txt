13 ContributorsD-Boi (Interlude) LyricsTalkin' hanging out wit' the D-Boi's
You know you a D-Boi
Cause when someone frontin' something 'S like havin' two daddies
One time my home boy fronted me a 8 ball at 3 oclock
At 4:30 he wanted the money back
It's rough bein' on that thang man
How you gonna front me somebody done fronted you?
He ain't no real real hustler, the dude shootin' at both of us
Hit you wit' a quarter pound talkin' bout 'we coming up'
A real D-Boi know you gotta get you own work
And you don't get high off your own supply
Til later on at night
I gotta drop of 'bout 30 keys
