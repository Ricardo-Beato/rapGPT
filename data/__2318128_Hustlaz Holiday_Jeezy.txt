15 ContributorsHustlaz Holiday Lyrics
The grind never stop, man
I don't give a fuck how much money you got, my nigga
I don't give a fuck how rich you is, nigga
You still gotta hustle
Every day, it's a holiday every day, nigga

I got hustlin' on my resume
Wouldn't think it, never, ever hear the hustlers say
That he don't wanna hustle no more (No more)
No more (No more), no more (No more), no more (Yeah)
And it's a hustlin' holiday
Wouldn't make it, you'd never, ever hear a hustler say
That he don't wanna hustle no more (No more)
No more (No more), no more (No more), yeah, yeah

We hustle on our birthday, we hustlin' on Christmas
Don't care if it's my worst day, them kid gon' get they cream up
Keep your eyes on the prize, yeah, eye of the tiger ,boy
If we talkin' hustlin' you know who the messiah, boy
What a hustler need a bed for? I ain't tryna lay down
When you on the come up, all I know's to stay down
You don't see me at the club, nigga
I don't see you at the bank, though
When I walk up in that bank, nigga
I walk in through that back door
I can't lie, I love the grind, I can't even stay awake
Here you go, I love you, mama, I'm even hustlin' mother's day
Kept me hustlin' Thanksgivin', stack it like a Black Jew
You know today a holiday for hustlin' niggas like you
You might also like
I got hustlin' on my resume
Wouldn't think it, never, ever hear the hustlers say
That he don't wanna hustle no more (No more)
No more (No more), no more (No more), no more (Yeah)
And it's a hustlin' holiday
Wouldn't make it, you'd never, ever hear a hustler say
That he don't wanna hustle no more (No more)
No more (No more), no more (No more), yeah, yeah

Hustle Monday through Monday and we ain't missin' one day
We all gon' be rich one day, put that on God on Sunday
You lazy, bitch, then stay away, we even hustle on Labor Day
And I ain't been home all week, I wonder what the neighbors say
Ain't no such thing as "I can't", if I want, I get that
They talkin' 'bout how you fell off when it's all 'bout how you get back
Hustle every minute, every hour, shit can go from sweet to sour
Right from sour back to sweet, you-you just practice what you preach
We don't do no vacays, we hustle every day, nigga
Just send you on that vacay, we count our paper, pray, nigga
Hustlers don't get no sleep, you niggas stay sleeping
I've been griding all week, I'm hustlin' them weekends

I got hustlin' on my resume
Wouldn't think it, never, ever hear the hustlers say
That he don't wanna hustle no more (No more)
No more (No more), no more (No more), no more (Yeah)
And it's a hustlin' holiday
Wouldn't make it, you'd never, ever hear a hustler say
That he don't wanna hustle no more (No more)
No more (No more), no more (No more), yeah, yeah2Embed
