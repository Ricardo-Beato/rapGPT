Back-back for an old gnat with a peahat on her lil back
She need to come back, but I'm a true blood, she need to bome back
She wear boy clothes, her crack, she never show that
Class where it's at, she a real gnat, she a true brat
She gone bring it back, see I'm Papi, I mean Thuggie
I might cop it
She got cute feet, she got nice teeth
She got good hair, her eyes droppie
(?), I can handle you, I can slander you, I can bander you
I can camel you, I can mammal you
I can miss you, David Banner you
Air force 1's, Air force 2's
We can fly too, we can fly a few
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to you
I'mma seahawk in the flyin' coupe
I'll see outta you, I'll paddle you
Like a biker (?), I'll saddle you
Like an earthquake, shake salad you
Put wood in you like a paddle, boo
You might also like

Hey, wait, what's on your Skooly
Got paid today, no fuckin' movie
Big Guwap gone take my weight, he gone show me my way
Just follow that pace
Gone succeed twice, gone succeed thrice
That gnat burn your motherfuckin' ass
'For I pass, stop actin' like fuckin' trash
I'mma G plus I smoke ass, that's gas
Come trash, your ass with my dinick
You broke, better hit you a linick
Ride the dick too fast, need a ticket
So bad she'll end up missin'
Come here baby
Surround my ho with grineen like the Navy
My pocket look like a bear team, Chicago baby
We never ever been no lifeguard, we don't save them baby
Why order? Why order? Why order? Why order? Why order?
