Eh yo Timb, you know
Niggas like Dr Dre and the Neptunes and Just Blaze
They should be so hot they be keepin us workin yah feel me
But but that nigga R. Kelly
He got one of the illest lines when he say
"Is anybody feelin freaky"
Man up...yep, good to go
Ele-phant Man and Missy Elliott (yeah)
Ladies keep it movin (uh)
Gi dem di dance now
(It's like butter baby, it's like butter)
Buss di dance now
(It's like butter baby, it's like butter)
(It's like butter baby, it's like butter)
(It's like butter baby, it's like butter)
Missy, Elliot
Ladies windin around
Tweet show dem kindly how fi do it
(Whoo, come on)

When you hear the song, role down yah window
Let the music thump yeah, thump thump thump thump
Take a walk in the club, thats how I roll
You look so so down, so so so so
Now when you step out on the scene, so fresh so clean
Lookin like a wet dream, yo know what I mean
Its about that time, what time would that be?
Wind yah waist line to the base line
Slow it down now get the beat right
