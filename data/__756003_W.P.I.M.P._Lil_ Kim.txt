7 ContributorsW.P.I.M.P. LyricsGood evening ladies and gentlemen
I am here live
Welcome to W.P.I.M.P. T
I don't know what it take
I'm talking about it's hard in the beginning in the industry
How the f**k do you get in the industry and then stay there
Every time you come out you got some more hot shit
Doing some more shit that bit as 'round the country go
That's what the f**k I meant to do
That's living legendship
You just livin', that's how I've been
But if you don't watch your mouth
Somebody might take it apart tooYou might also like1Embed
