8 ContributorsWill It Lyrics
Yeah
Destined for a life behind bars, but now where I'm living is gated
I made it, made million on millions, I'm elated
But never outdated, I move with the times
Do whatever suits me like Louis Vuitton, one of a kind, the don
A legend that's destined to pass the baton, and so on
I don't mean to go on, but (Go on), okay, fine
I'ma get mine
No shade, let me shine, in due time
My rhyme is nothing but classic
Most people fakе, nothing but plastic, get ya ass kicked
Quick, take a sip
Bitchеs know I'm packin' like a trip
Now get the fuck off my dick, I'm just a man
Bullshit make me sick, good pussy make me cum
Most never make it where I'm from
Feel these kicks in my soul
Getting money was the goal, now it's be a good person
Shit worsen, second I come through dispersing
This ill lyricism like a prism deep inside your mind
Never counterintuitive, so divine
I spit it strictly off the top of my mind
Can you understand, I’m just a man, where I’m from
Where I’m going, no one knowing
This is how we do it, who is showing their cards
The highest was the odds
I don’t understand, I’m not up there like the Gods
But I will be, yes I will be
Said I will be, say yes I, say yes I, say yes I willYou might also likeEmbed
