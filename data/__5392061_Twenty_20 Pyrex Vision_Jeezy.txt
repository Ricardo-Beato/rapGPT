4 ContributorsTwenty/20 Pyrex Vision Lyrics
All I know is what I know and I don't know nothin' else
Them indictments come around, best believe I'm goin' stealth (Yeah)
I ain't about to ask some nigga some shit I can so myself (Nah)
See me grindin' in these Dickies and these new designer belts (Ayy)
Only thing that's on my mind, an abundance of wealth
Givin' up or givin' in is some shit I never felt
'Cause I'm a street nigga (Street nigga), and I don't sleep nigga, gotta eat, nigga
Street nigga, nothin' cheap nigga, we don't lease, nigga (Go)
I'm laid back in this Maybach, bitch, it's payback
From way back, and I'm still on, them niggas hate that
I'm Superman, got a super grind, where my cape at? (Cape at)
I'm Clark Kent, got a laser beam, where my safe at? (Ha-ha)

Always on my grind, always on a mission (Mission)
Tried to tell 'em then, they weren't tryna listen (Listen)
Ask me what I do, I say, "I hustle for a livin'"
Plus I got that twenty-twenty Pyrex vision (Let's go)

Let's go nigga, nothin' slow nigga, want some mo', nigga? (Mo', nigga)
For sure nigga, rule number one, grind like you're poor, nigga (Damn)
Bounce back, get that cash stack, like at NASDAQ (Yeah)
Count that, slow your roll, nigga, gotta stash that (Ayy)
Get your check, let your accountant get it, gotta pass that (Pass that)
Get your check, bein' reckless with it, yeah, we past that
Invest the shit, straight up test that shit, win or lose, nigga (Lose, nigga)
Bill Gates and that Warren Buffett, them is clues, nigga
You might also like
Always on my grind, always on a mission (Mission)
Tried to tell 'em then, they weren't tryna listen (Listen)
Ask me what I do, I say, "I hustle for a livin'"
Plus I got that twenty-twenty Pyrex vision (Let's go)

Always on my grind
Tried to tell 'em then (Pyrex vision)
Ask me what I do, I say, "I hustle for"— (Pyrex vision)
Pyrex vision
Always on my grind (Pyrex vision)
Tried to tell 'em then (Pyrex vision)
Ask me what I do, I say, "I hustle for"— (Pyrex vision)
