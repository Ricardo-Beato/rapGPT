6 ContributorsDracula Lyrics
Neighbors real nosey, weed real flunky, I'm a weed Junkie
Got F-la cash, but I still eat baloney
Beef ravioli, turn to Master Chovey
Grab the macaroni, come and smack his homie
You know I got it on me, flat em like a Sony
Burn em like a phony, In Florida like I'm Tony
Bitches said she saw me, she thought she saw my Audi
Okay hoe, I'm outy, I just want the toppy
You said it was your hobby
Well, why you ain't do it sloppy?
Yeah, I got my moppy, Okay cool, you copy
Dare you try to rob me, turn you to a zombie
Baby, you're a lil boy, he calling for his mommy
In a red car, gettin head by a blondie
Chopper started laughing, I'm like ain't shit funny
I might be wearing a see through coat, you tryna find me
Yеah, we open, like a plaza
Screen a nigga, likе a plasma
Got the pump, like some asthma
Spray your block, like a tagger
Foot down, It's going faster
Football, we gon catch em
50 shots, it's a massacre
Taste some blood, bitch it's Dracula
With a boy band, call him spectacular
Uh-uh, he smoking regular
One of my hoes, BMOS Dracula
They flipping gangs, these niggas spatulas
I know she fucking, bitch I'm a happener
She put it down, I have to laugh at her
She curious, to why I don't ride with her
Your pig ass ain't come around till I got my cabbage up
Your pig ass ain't come around till I got my cabbage up
Your pig ass ain't come around till I got my cabbage up
Your pig ass ain't come around till I got my cabbage up
Your pig ass ain't come around till I got my cabbage upYou might also likeEmbed
