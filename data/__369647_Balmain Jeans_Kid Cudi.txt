Mmm, yeah

Help me take off my Balmain jeans, I'll undo yours
You can lick it after I'm done licking you first
I wanna taste it, tired of waiting, are you tasty?
Yum, yum, come on baby, yum
Hope you can feel that vibe, the vibes of the night
Your body is warm in my arms, we're under the stars
Can I come inside your vortex?
Can I come inside your vortex, let me baby

It's been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body
I need you to protect my heart
Gimme your hand, put it here, this is where you start

Keep feelin' on me (Don't stop)
Keep feelin' on me
Keep feelin' on me (Don't stop)
Keep feelin' on me

Lord help me (Lord help me), Lord help me (Lord help me)
Got a lover under my covers, I don't want her to leave
She says I'm perfect, perfectly kissing on my neck
She is the sexiest, she said she loves my scent
Hope you can feel that vibe, the vibes in the night
Her body is warm in my arms, we're under the stars
I wanna taste it, tired of waiting, are you tasty?
Yum, yum, come on baby, yum
