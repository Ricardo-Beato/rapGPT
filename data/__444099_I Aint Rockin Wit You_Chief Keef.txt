Bang, Sosa, Sosa, Sosa
O'Block, bang, bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang
Chief Keef
L's, L's, L's, L's, L's, L's

I got a lot of hitters
I only rock with killers
And if you ain't letting pistols pop
Then I ain't rocking with you
I'm L's ass nigga
Glory Boyz be my agenda
And if you ain't letting pistols pop
Then I ain't rocking with you, nigga
I ain't rocking with you
I can't be rocking with you, boy
You ain't letting pistols pop
So I ain't rocking with you, nigga
I ain't rocking with you
I can't be rocking with you, boy
You ain't letting pistols pop
So I ain't rocking with you

I can't be rocking with you
I only rock with killers
You say you letting' pistols pop
But boy stop 
3hunna ass nigga, L's up ass nigga
And I ain't rocking with you
I leave your ass missing
I'm boss man kind, I got a lot of hoes
I save money like a bitch
Cause this money come and goes
Bitch I'm in the field
This shit is for real
You can get your ass killed
Talking about all you do you kill
I gotta see a mill
At least before I'll be killed
All I know about is smoking drugs
And then popping pills
This money so high
With the L's in the sky
Drop a "L" in tookavile
Screaming "Fuck the other side!"
You might also like
I got a lot of hitters
I only rock with killers
And if you ain't letting pistols pop
Then I ain't rocking with you
I'm L's ass nigga
Glory Boys be my agenda
And if you ain't letting pistols pop
Then I ain't rocking with you, nigga
I ain't rocking with you
I can't be rocking with you, boy
You ain't letting pistols pop
So I ain't rocking with you, nigga
I ain't rocking with you
I can't be rocking with you, boy
You ain't letting pistols pop
So I ain't rocking with you

That bitch ain't rockin with us
You stunnin', stop it boy
You sucked on my dick
Can't be thinking I'ma miss you
I'm wild ass nigga, OTF we the team
And if you ain't with the team
Bro Gods make a scene
The clip super long, we be shooting for months
Roll up the dope, we live few blunts
Like D Rose Iâ€™m pistol totin
When his chieffin' ass come through I show you
RIP La Flare, he be on anything
Fucking hoes, hittin stains
Shooting niggas in the brain
These niggas lames, they not on anything
Bitch I got a lot of fans
Mean I got a lot of fame
I got a lot of hitters
I only rock with killers
And if you ain't letting pistols pop
Then I ain't rocking with you
I'm L's ass nigga
Glory Boys be my agenda
And if you ain't letting pistols pop
Then I ain't rocking with you, nigga
I ain't rocking with you
I can't be rocking with you, boy
You ain't letting pistols pop
So I ain't rocking with you, nigga
I ain't rocking with you
I can't be rocking with you, boy
You ain't letting pistols pop
So I ain't rocking with you2Embed
