Woah

Shit

Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
Lil' Cannon
I understand, I understand, I understand (I understand)
I understand, I understand, I understand (Let me know)
That hunnid racks, that cuban links, the kilograms (That money, money)
I understand, I understand, I understand (Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi)

I understand, I understand, I understand (I understand)
I understand, I understand, I understand (I understand)
I understand, I understand, I understand (I understand)
That hunnid racks, that cuban links, the kilograms (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I understand that lil uzi might crack a deal
I understand how that shit right here 'bout to feel (I get that money)
They askin' me on the streets am I gettin' meals (Am I gettin' meals)
I said I don't care, as long as I survive for my next meal
And I be gettin' all this paper, I'm doin' well
I understand that next year, I'll be XXL (I will, I will)
I understand that I be juggin' on the block (I'm juugin' my nigga)
But Lil Uzi gotta watch out for the 12 (Gotta watch out for the 12)
And I don't fuck with no fuck niggas, they be snitchin'
I give you Glock if you got problems, don't start bitchin'
I hit you up like in your shit, nigga not with it (You not with it)
And this Glock tend to knock you off your pelvis
Young nigga but I'm heavy like a OG
Ya your bitch wan' suck my dick, but she ain't even know me
Talkin' shit I put a hole in you like slowly (Like slowly)
Hit you with 8 or 24 if you think you Kobe
You might also like
I understand, I understand, I understand (I understand)
I understand, I understand, I understand (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I understand, I understand, I understand (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That hunnid racks, that cuban links, the kilograms (Cannon, yeah-yeah)2Embed
