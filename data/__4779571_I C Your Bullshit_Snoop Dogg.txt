9 ContributorsI C Your Bullshit Lyrics
I see your bullshit
I see your bullshit
I see your bullshit
You ain't changed
You ain't changed
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I don't have no time for you
So you should have no time for me

Oh, damn, oh, oh, damn
I see your bullshit
I see your bullshit
For real, you still on bullshit?
Nigga, miss me with that bullshit
Nigga, miss me with that bullshit

I see your phony ass
Out here actin' like you changed with yo funky ass
Fake-fake as my last bitch, flunky ass
Mind all over the place with your clumsy ass
Niggas still fake-fake fakin' like they not
Ferraris switchin' lanes, 'scape takin' niggas spots
Oh, you thinkin' that she love you?
No, she just needs a sponsor
Claimin' you a boss, but you still livin' with yo mama
You might also like
Oh, damn, oh, oh, damn
I see your bullshit
I see your bullshit
For real, you still on bullshit?
Nigga, miss me with that bullshit
Nigga, miss me with that bullshit

Why you actin' smart when you not? (No, you're not)
Actin' like you hot when you not? (On my mama)
When you not? When you not? When you not?
I can't fake with you no more, I'm just not (Can't do it)
All that fast talkin' shit, it ain't gon' work here
Go back over there 'fore you get hurt here
Shit hit the fan on the Klan, I was first-first
Think I'm a problem, on God, it get worse here

Oh, damn, oh, oh, damn
I see your bullshit
I see your bullshit
For real, you still on bullshit?
Nigga, miss me with that bullshit
Nigga, miss me with that bullshit
Every time I see you, you beg a nigga for money
Don't even ask how I'm doin', but tell me keep it one hunnid
So, I'ma say it and mean it so you can hear this
Loud and clear, fuck outta here
See I'm a smile away, put the pile away
And I can smell bullshit about a mile away
Old bullshit-ass nigga, let it go
Or a bunch of bullshit is what you headed fo'

Oh, damn, oh, oh, damn
I see your bullshit
I see your bullshit
For real, you still on bullshit?
Nigga, miss me with that bullshit
Nigga, miss me with that bullshit

I see your bullshit
I see your bullshit
I see your bullshit
You ain't changed
You ain't changed
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I don't have no time for you
So you should have no time for me, me1Embed
