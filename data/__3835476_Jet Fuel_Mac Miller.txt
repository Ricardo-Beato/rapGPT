Stopper, to every DJ, dem haffi talk to me proper
Mi come a dancehall, mi a go kill you with di lingua
Galang Cutty Ranks 'cause you full up of a stamina
Anyweh me go, Lord, a roots and culture
One man me praise, a di Almighty, Jah Jah
Jah Jah give me strength and him give me di power
That's why Cutty Ranking, full up of stamina
Come a dancehall, mi a go kill you with di...

Yeah, used to wanna be a superhero
Flyin' round with a cape catchin' bad guys
Now my head underwater
But I ain't in the shower and I ain't gettin' baptized (No)
To the good and the bad times (Bad times)
All the cuts, broken bones, and the black eyes (Black eyes)
Young motherfucker with a mad mind
Made a couple million off of rap lines
Y'all can’t tell me nuttin' no more
Came from the basement under that floor (Floor)
You don't come close, you don't even know I'm the G.O.A.T. (Hmm)
You don’t need to know how I go
'Cause I know what you want
All I wanna do is the most
Backflip off the rope, sky hook when I'm in the post
Yeah, my girl too clutch to choke (Hmm)
And I ain't callin' it quits
You can build a wall with your bricks
While I keep talkin' that shit, it's like this (It's like this) (Hmm)
Liquor still in my cup (My cup)
Get faded when I wake up (Wake up)
'Cause everything is too much (Too much)
So what? (So what?)
You might also like
Woke up this mornin' with a bright idea (Smoke)
Maybe I can exist forever right here (Let it run)
Yeah (Mmm-hmm, yeah)
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm

Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel

Hundred-twenty on a car that I don't whip (Woo)
I don't even pull it up the driveway
Throwin' up shots like I don't miss (No)
Never put a limit on the high stakes (No)
Try to pull my card, tell them, "Go Fish" (Woo)
You ain't gonna find a lie in my face
I pick it up and let it go quick
They wanna get pussy from my—(Uh-oh)
Yeah, I don't say nuttin' that I don't know
Jumpin' out the womb wearin' Polo
Everybody wanna jump in, but I'm old school
Lone wolf, take 'em on solo, yeah
I don't need nobody (I don't need nobody!)
I don't need to be nobody (I don't need to be nobody!)
I'm just doin' my thing
Kick it at the crib, I don't see nobody, no
So over there with that bullshit
We don't need it on this side
I'm pullin' up in that new shit
You always whippin' that dick ride
I demand your respect
I won't share my connect (No)
Let's get this clear, I am here
I don't care who got next, young vet (Goddamn)
Feelin' like they forget, I let it slide, this time
Like twenty-five years I've been high and no less (Yes)
Shit, I know, I don't guess
Rather glow, I won't stress
Better say that shit with your chest
Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel (Jet fuel)
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel (Jet fuel)


Fate in your hands
While you're waitin' for me
I'm already there
Fallin' in deep
Now is only now
Head back to the ground, dear47Embed
