10 ContributorsHell Yeah Lyrics
If you talking about money, the hell yeah, nigga
Did I fuck that thot, hell yeah, did you?
If you wanna get some money then hell yeah, I'm with you
Am I gon' get this money, hell yeah, is you?
Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Boy you smoking on that ew ew, ain't you?
I'm smoking fresh packs of pale whale nigga

Look here I can't feel you like I'm in a wheelchair, hell yeah

I be grinding hard
She point at her knee like put yo foot here, hell yeah

You can smell it even if you wasn't in here, hell yeah
Ten thousand dollar clothes, remember wearing pale pale nigga
Bitch tryna find a ghost, I ain't even in there idiot
Tryna get some money then hand me up idiot
Don't be an idiot, clap yo ass like Missy Eliot
Counting on the dough, hell yeah
Pour up a 84, hell yeah
Got yo nine to five nigga, hell yeah
Do yo bitch do the most, hell yeah
Sneak dissing on the low, hell yeah

Boy you smoking on that ew ew, ain't you?
I'm smoking fresh packs of pale whale niggaEmbed
