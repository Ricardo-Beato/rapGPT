Wearin' every chain on my neck (We in the house, come on)

I ride around with a TEC (Champ)
Stashin' all the pills in my desk (Champ)
Wearin' every chain on my neck (Go crazy on 'em)

Look, boy, boy, don't believe what's on your TV
Look, boy, don't you sit close to the TV
Look, boy, seeing is believing

Would it be unlawful (Yeah)
To spend this honeymoon in a brothel?
And share pics from the camera
But they'll be quick to turn that into a scandal
I'm down in the Meadows
Slidin' down the Waterfall, creep to the ghetto
Need my Rio de Janeiro
And I'm swimmin' out that bitch, Michael Phelps with the medals
So visit me (Yeah)
I just built a castle deep (Yeah, yeah)
In them trees (Yeah)
That's how I get them backwoods free (Yeah, yeah)

Bend it back from me (Yeah, yeah)
Way, way back for me (Yeah, yeah)
Way, way back for me
Way, way back for me
Way, way back for me
