"Man we're making all this money
Yeah all the hoes like this
Yeah, fired teachers too so I won't have to go to school no more. We can have all of this. We can be rich
We'll be going around teasing women and stuff
Yeah, selling candy, getting money
Just selling candy, getting money, making the greenbacks."
I'm trying to get that greenback
I'm trying to get that greenback
Pro Era on the rise, man you tape that
We'll never be broke again
Bro-Broke again
Whole damn world in the palm of my hands
Pro Era on the rise, man you tape that
We'll never be broke againYou might also likeEmbed
