Starin' in the mirror and what do I see?
A three-eyed man starin' back at me
Two for the flesh and one for the soul
But where did man go? I'm tryna fill that hole
Tryna fill that hole
Fill that hole
Feel my touch

Yeah
Speak with your mind
Speak with your mind
It's only us left (It's only us left)
Dividin' time, livin' between the lines
Only one goal
To reach the sunshine


Can you feel it?
Ballroom dance with my demons (Ballroom dance with my demons)
Look pon' the dance floor, they're schemin' (Look pon' the dance floor, they're schemin')
At first I didn't believe it, but why shouldn't I?
I'm a bad man (Bad man)
Hmm, I'm bad
I'm a bad man
