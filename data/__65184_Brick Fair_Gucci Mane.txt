28 ContributorsBrick Fair Lyrics
Ever since I got a brick fair
I never look back there
If you ain't from the Zone 6
Shawty don't go there
I'mma die a bachelor
Girlfriend I don't want none
I already smashed her
So don't even go there

Bitch I got a brick fair
Say them boys don't play fair
I'm from the East Atlanta Zone 6
And the kid got rich there
Hell yeah we got bales there
And you know we got bricks there
If the police pull me over
I'll probably get the damn chair
First one off the bench nigga
You can call me the 6 man
Lot of squares in my living room
AKA I'm the brickman
And I hope that you a snitch player
So we can throw you in a ditch player
The way I wrestle with the work nigga
People call me Rick Flair
You might also like
Ever since I got a brick fair
I never look back there
If you ain't from the Zone 6
Shawty don't go there
I'mma die a bachelor
Girlfriend I don't want none
I already smashed her
So don't even go there

Dirty ass folk, dirty ass pistols
My lil goon in the hood & he just wait for me to hit him
Do you got a body for me beggin' on the line
And when I do, what would you do or not?
Hit em in the head, I had an extra five
Pushin weight like I'm doing exercise
Moving up the interstate
And I got them pills and pies
I go Pauly Costellano, I'm a mafia santano
I got accepted to the MOB now I think I'm Tony Soprano
Without the t.v, you wanna be if you see me
Just A-1 FBG, we hit onyx on our PT
Keep water on like FiJi
I make real movies in HD
Imma astronaut my real life
I promise you can't see me
Ever since I got a brick fair
I never look back there
If you ain't from the Zone 6
Shawty don't go there
I'mma die a bachelor
Girlfriend I don't want none
I already smashed her
So don't even go thereEmbed
