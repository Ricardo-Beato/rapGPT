Pubic hair
Oh my gosh, I'm going there
Where are you going, Thug?
To her spot
When she get out the shower, drink her bathtub
Inside the club, shoot his ass up
Play with me - get hit with these bucks
Pass me the pump
Leave him short like a stump
Feel like Donald Trump
I made Forbes List this month
But come here, babygirl
I know you want go to Thug's world
I buy you diamonds and pearls
You've got the best of both worlds
You might also like

I swear I miss you
I promise I miss you
Babygirl, I miss you

Mwyah mwyah, give me kisses, baby
Youse a boss
Can't shit on you
Thugger constipated
Yee ain't got more watches than me
Call it Flava Flav
And I'm not talking about no candy
I want some now and later
Babygirl, I miss you
Oh yeah, I miss you
I fucking miss you
You turned up to the max
These niggas can't diss you
Ain't talking about no deed
But you know I miss you
If you're clean, I'll lick you
So come here, come here
You ain't gotta walk no more
No wheelchair
You know we loaded with the bands
It's there
I'll let my bitch flex on you
Ric Flair

Oh yeah, I miss you
