19 ContributorsInterlude (Cole World) LyricsI'm drivin', nigga as soon as I get the text we all in the car like, "Ahh, yeah nigga, we outta here nigga, yeah nigga!!" So we goin' crazy, we goin' crazy as fuck, we like super excited. Dawg, ten seconds later, all I see in the back and hear is
Woop Woop
Blue lights right behind me, on the fuckin' undercover car, of all things
So I'm like "Fuck" I knew right away what it was. Dawg, for the, for two and a half maybe three years before that, in New York, I had been drivin' dirty, my license was no good
Dawg, how 'bout the moment I found out I was gon' get the deal a fuckin' cop got behind me and I already knew what it was
I handled it so like, I handled it the best way you could ever go to jail like I went to jail knowin', bitch like, ah know what I'm sayin'? I'm in there dawg, spendin' the night in jail realizin', like, "These niggas have no clue, bitch I'm 'bout to sign to Jay-Z"
Laughs
That was the easiest night in jail a nigga could ever do, sonYou might also like6Embed
