Yeah, shinin' hard 'cause we back up (Back up)
Rose gold from your neck up (Young BL$$D, boy, you saucin')
You know shit gon' get sloppy, tryna check us (Check us)
Pop an X pill like we Malcolm (Young BL$$D, boy, you saucin'), yeah
(BL$$D)

I'm in a relationship with all my bitches, yeah
I need to cut some of 'em off, I need help
I got some bad tings, I want her to myself
Had to take the time to cut 'em off, I need help
I know how to make the girls go crazy
When you treat her like your number one baby
Put my bitches on yachts, we don't do jet-skis
Put your ice on rocks, they need to help me

No baby, your collection, won't stand for it
You know you're in relationship with all us
I get a few texts a day sayin', "It's all yours"
I got a few states on speed dial like good drugs
Get in your bag, uh, yeah, get in your bag, uh
Hundred new purse for a brat, uh
Comin' down the street, new Jag (Skrrt)
Turbo bitch 'bout to drag, nigga had M's 'fore ass
Got a brand new bitch, who that?
Rock the flooded AP, all black
White toes, get me a tan, cocaine, killing time
All a bitch wanna do is shine, Audemars, pick which kind
I made you a starter, you went from a dime to a quarter
I Chico DeBarge it, I'm leaving that loud in apartments, yeah
Don't play with a sergeant (Ah), I'm ready to spoil it (Ah)
She suck on my dick (Yeah), I'm hidin' in the closet (Uh)
I'm higher than the moon, three mil' in the room
You get silver spoon, I bought you some goons
You might also like
Shinin' hard 'cause we back up (Back up)
Rose gold from your neck up (Yeah)
You know shit gon' get sloppy, tryna check us (Check us)
Pop an X pill like we Malcolm, yeah, hey

I'm in a relationship with all my bitches, yeah
I need to cut some of 'em off, I need help
I got some bad tings, I want her to myself
Had to take the time to cut 'em off, I need help
I know how to make the girls go crazy
When you treat her like your number one baby
Put my bitches on yachts, we don't do jet-skis
Put your ice on rocks, they need to help me

I don't do jet-skis, give me the yacht please
I made you queen status, check out my lean status
I'm in a relationship with all my bitches, yeah
I put my dick inside her mouth before she left
Yeah, I built relationships with all my bitches, yes
I put my dick right in her mouth before she act
I got your bitch in a backpack
I paid extra for the crib, it got a kid shack
I paid extra for the crib, it got a game room
Got a penthouse in the back, it ain't my main room
Tamika, Jo and Porsche they kept it silent
That's the only reason I let 'em fly private
Shinin' hard 'cause we back up (Back up)
Rose gold from your neck up (Yeah)
You know shit gon' get sloppy, tryna check us (Check us)
Pop an X pill like we Malcolm, yeah, hey

I'm in a relationship with all my bitches, yeah
I need to cut some of 'em off, I need help
I got some bad tings, I want her to myself
Had to take the time to cut 'em off, I need help
I know how to make the girls go crazy
When you treat her like your number one baby
Put my bitches on yachts, we don't do jet-skis
Put your ice on rocks, they need to help me44Embed
