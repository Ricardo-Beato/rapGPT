5 ContributorsToo Hood For Her Lyrics
I'm too hood for her
I'm way too hood for her
I'm too hood for her
I'm way too hood for her
I know I'm too hood for her
I know I'm too hood for her
I tell ya what's good for ya
Cause I know I'm too hood for ya
I think I'm way too hood for ya
And I know you tell me what's good for ya
You better go get a good lawyer
Cause I'm just telling ya what's good for ya

I had your ass doing everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
And I put that shit on everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
I'm too hood for her, I'm too hood for her
I'm too hood for hеr, I'm too hood for her
I put that shit on everything
I put it on еverything, I put it on everything
I put it on everything, I put it on everything
You might also like
They say that opposites attract
And I knew the first time we laid eyes on each other, you would be my girl, and that's facts
She from the other side, when I say other side, I mean the other side
We on the Boulevard, we in the Avenue
We ain't havin it, we went trappin it
Where the action at
Treat your chick like she my bitch, we got that dope connection
She only trip and start to bitch when she need some effection
And I pull up to her lunch break
And I lift her skirt and I eat the box
And her legs shake and yell checkmate
And I roll out and go get it
She got a couple girls hating on me, probably cause I hit it
But we never had a commitment
See we was really only kicking it
They was tryna be on different shit
And I was only tryna chill
But with you 

I had your ass doing everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
And I put that shit on everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
I'm too hood for her, I'm too hood for her
I'm too hood for her, I'm too hood for her
I put that shit on everything
I put it on everything, I put it on everything
I put it on everything, I put it on everything
Wake and bake, early morning she roll my swishers
She ain't know about that freak I unleash in her
Was a schoolgirl, now she gone naughty
Cause I get up in that pussy, go retarded
And all the hoes on me
Smelled 'em from the start, I was in the streets
She wasn't even down for the lame shit, girl
Infatuated with a G
Said her boyfriend was like Carlton Banks
I'm from the hood, shawty what you think?
And oh, girl, fo' sho' girl
I have you trappin on the low girl
I stash that work up in your whip, and you ain't know girl
I have your ass doing everything, I give you game, cause I don't want you lames

I had your ass doing everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
And I put that shit on everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
I'm too hood for her, I'm too hood for her
I'm too hood for her, I'm too hood for her
I put that shit on everything
I put it on everything, I put it on everything
I put it on everything, I put it on everythingEmbed
