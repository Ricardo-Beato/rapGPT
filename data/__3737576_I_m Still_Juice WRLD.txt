Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Like, oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-ooh

I'm holdin' my breath and watchin' my step
I'm listin' regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression wasn't deception, you were lyin'

Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not hidin'
Bitch, I'm still movin', I'm in slow motion
I rolled my dosage, I'm gettin' higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel

Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-ah

Uh, fell in love with your face off the 'shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazin' at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof, ooh
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feelin' overconsumed
She walkin' me to my doom, I see her face in my room
When I'm alone in the room, I'ma blame that on the 'shrooms (Blame that on the shrooms)

Oh, feelin' ridiculed, feelin' like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose

I'm holdin' my breath and watchin' my step
I'm listin' regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression was in deception, you were lyin'

Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not hidin'
Bitch, I'm still movin', I'm in slow motion
I rolled my dosage, I'm gettin' higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel

Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh47Embed
