15 ContributorsE-Mac (Interlude) Lyrics
From Texas to GA, niggas bleeding your speaker box
Playas stayin' throwed, ho, putting diamonds off in your socks
Blowing killer, sipping lean and dropping screens
North Dallas and Aquemini, fool, it's all the same team (It's all the same team)You might also likeEmbed
