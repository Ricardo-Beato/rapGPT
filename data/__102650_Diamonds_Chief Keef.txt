51 ContributorsDiamonds Lyrics
Young Chop on the beat
We're next, we're next, geesh
O-Block
Bang
Bang, bang

I swear my diamonds are so blinding please don't look at my wrist (look at my wrist)
In one blink of an eye, I bet I can take your bitch (take your bitch)
That boy jewelry looking blurry like who sold him that shit (sold him that shit)
They say I ain't getting money well who told them that shit (told them that shit)
Ok your bitch she like my diamonds and the cars that I ride (car that I ride)
Or she might just like my style or its the squad that's behind me (squad that's behind me)
I don't know but she gone go cause my pockets on swole (pockets on swole)
I just walk up in the mall then I buy the whole store (buy the whole store)

I know my diamonds looking blinding, please don't look at my wrist (look at my wrist)
My young niggas shoot your face, if you think about taking my shit  (taking my shit)
10k for my ears, 20k for my wrist (20k for my wrist)
You ain't fucking me for free bitch 20k for my dick (20k for my dick)
Catch you slipping Scottie Pippen one phone call and you hit (call and you hit)
I just get these bitches numbers I don't call I forget (call I forget)
And I'm riding in them foreigns I'mma ride on St. Lawrence (St. Lawrence)
I'mma ride on brick squad catch a nigga I'm scoring (catch a nigga I'm scoring)

I swear my diamonds are so blinding please don't look at my wrist (look at my wrist)
In one blink of an eye, I bet I can take your bitch (take your bitch)
That boy jewelry looking blurry like who sold him that shit (sold him that shit)
They say I ain't getting money well who told them that shit (told them that shit)
Ok your bitch she like my diamonds and the cars that I ride (car that I ride)
Or she might just like my style or its the squad that's behind me (squad that's behind me)
I don't know but she gone go cause my pockets on swole (pockets on swole)

You got a bad batch to much bakin' on it
Right back on the stove, right back to them shows
Right back to my bitches, your advance is my clothes
