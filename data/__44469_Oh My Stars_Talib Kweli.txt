8 ContributorsOh My Stars Lyrics
I'm freestyling, for me, myself and I
I write them on the paper til it gets sky high
I say goodbye, to all the bad things I've done
I start a new beginning, and this is how it begun
From, KRS-One to Talib Kweli
Now I'm the best superstar on BET
And MTV, better yet I'm known universally
I am the key, to being the best MC
The prophecy, the one and only
A timeless masterpiece, I ain't the least
I'm the best, cause God said so
I'm just trying to express my lyrical flow

Yo, yo
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
It feel good, it feel so damn, uh
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
It feel good, yo, yo, yo
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
Baby tell me how it feel when I always keep it real
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
Yo, now how it feel? Yo

It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
Khalil brought the fly shit, I brought the hood appeal
Notes from the piano is falling out the sky
Like angels losing their wings so they see how it feel to cry
Babies have babies for the welfare coupons
Dudes on the radio rapping, them cats is lukewarm
I get up on it, spit up on it like a new born
The family structure ruptured, there's living proof like a group home
B-Boy being a man, throw a suit on
Stepping out hotter than Tuscon when the soup's on
My son like, "Daddy, I be missing you when you gone"
I said I gotta go so I can stack chips like Lou Corn
I ask my daughter how I look, she fixed my hat so I can wear it cool
Cause she's like "That's what they wear in school"
Then she asked me "Daddy, you know any superstars?"
I looked at her and said "Stop being silly, that's what you two are"
I say it now and I've said it before
And you can trust me on this cause I've been through it, y'all
Follow your heart and you can do it dog
Baby you're a star...
You might also like
All of the days...
All of the days, of my life I spent on trying to find
Yet another way to show you how, how special you are
There ain't no body, that can take that away from you
No matter what...
Even though...

Yeah, yo, yo, yo
And even though mummy and daddy might fight all through the night
Argue and fuss, you a part of us that we've got to get right
I don't love you to death, cause I love you to life
And you a teenager, you might not want my advice
You might be full of spite, think you're grown, still a tyke
And say things that cut like a patient under the knife
I say this, cause I was once a teenager too
And respect for my peers is really all that I related to
But I made it through, you gonna make it too
So much I wanna say to you...

Baby you a star, that's what you are to me
You know I can tell? Cause you a part of meEmbed
