6 ContributorsDonâ€™t Wanna Be Right Lyrics
Nigga whats wrong with you
And I don't wanna be right

If selling dope is wrong to you
Then I don't wanna be right
If sipping lean is wrong to you
I don't wanna be right
If checking off is wrong to you
Then I don't wanna be right
If getting money is wrong to you
Then I'll never be right

Well i'm just smoking kush and sipping lean all my life
And I might have to pour a half of pint in all my sprites
If u see Gucci fighting a grizzly bear I'm aight
I bet I hit that grizzly bear ass with all my might
I had 2 dykes sucking my dick and that was just last night
I passed out from sipping lean but i'm alright
I put that blama on yo ass man I won't think twice
Don't give a damn they hating on me they hated on Jesus Christ
I got yo wife sucking dick with ice, that bitch go hard
I  pulled yo card and I fuck yo broad pass her to the squad
You playing hard but don't think you smart
I just might pull out the garage take it apart and paint it orange
You might also like
If selling dope is wrong to you
Then I don't wanna be right
If sipping lean is wrong to you
I don't wanna be right
If checking off is wrong to you
Then I don't wanna be right
If getting money is wrong to you
Then I'll never be right

Cause I sell dope that make me different
That's how we eat the family business
Selling dope that shit ain't right but fuck it
I gotta feed my children
My son keep calling my baby mama trippin
Like a doctor I keep filling prescription
Wanted to sign a major deal but fuck that shit i'm independent
BMG my own business I could put you on niggas
6 months run paper chasing I ain't seen ma children
Top off seat back leaning riding to that Nipsey
Keep a bad bitch with me rolling Caviar swishy
See I done did it all fucked all a the bra
Drove all the cars hopping spree with dawg
See I done did it all fucked all a the bra
Drove all the cars hopping spree with dawg
If selling dope is wrong to you
Then I don't wanna be right
If sipping lean is wrong to you
I don't wanna be right
If checking off is wrong to you
Then I don't wanna be right
If getting money is wrong to you
Then I'll never be right

I remember them days didn't sleep didn't bathe
Grind a lot carrying weight tryna  wit a pay
Just a young nigga tryna profit off play
Just a Black nigga with nappy temp fade
Probly fuck yo girl back in the tenth grade
I'm a hustlin ass nigga man i'm stuck in my ways
I'm a gambling ass nigga shoot dies dice play spades
Ran off on your boy cause you felt he was fake
Real nigga for the real real nigga go relate
Real nigga go relate real nigga everyday
Gotta keep it on me gotta keep the thang off safe
Gotta keep it on me gotta keep the thang on spray
Fly ass nigga I ain't fucking with you bum ass bitch no time in the day
These nigga telling on the low keep em out ma face
These nigga playing snake they ain't playing shit straight
Riding hard mofucker go and get fuck wage
Working burger bar doe, she ain't taking pie scrapings
Where is you blazing that mofucker till it look amazing
Bring stam stam need the homie need to taste
Ever since I was a young nigga gone man I fell in love with that money
Fell in love with that money most a these nigga be really country
If selling dope is wrong to you
Then I don't wanna be right
If sipping lean is wrong to you
I don't wanna be right
If checking off is wrong to you
Then I don't wanna be right
If getting money is wrong to you
Then I'll never be right
