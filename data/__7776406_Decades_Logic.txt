I just wanna thank God for the life that I got
Seen a lot of pain, yeah, I seen a lot
Coulda copped that Lamborghini off the lot
But money isn't everything
Money isn't the reason that I sing
I got a lot of chains, got a lot of bling
But money isn't everything
No, money isn't everything
I just wanna thank God for the life that I got
Seen a lot of pain, yeah, I seen a lot
Coulda copped that Lamborghini off the lot
But money isn't everything
Money isn't the reason that I sing

Yeah
Yo, this motherfucker 6ix, man
He played me this verse I had from like ten years ago, so I thought I'd do it now

Ayy, look to my left and see my brother sellin' drugs
Look to my right and see my sister's fuckin' thugs
Ain't it funny how this life go? One moment, you're in the dark
But when that light glow, it's like you're seein' for the first time
As I penetrate your mind like a burst of ammunition that was shot out of a nine
I'm givin' everything I got, so, yeah, it better be my time
They said I'd never make it, that's the reason I still rhyme now
Feelin' like Annie singin' 'bout the Sun
No food in my stomach, hopin' that tomorrow gon' come, yeah
Maybe it won't, but I pray it will
'Cause drug dealers on the corner, they finna spray you at will
And this music is a dream that I plan to fulfill
Starin' at the morgue through my windowsill
In the beginnin', I was itchin', no, I couldn't sit still
But when you got this much heat, it's just too hard to chill
You might also like
I just wanna thank God for the life that I got
Seen a lot of pain, yeah, I seen a lot
Coulda copped that Lamborghini off the lot
But money isn't everything
Money isn't the reason that I sing
I got a lot of chains, got a lot of bling
But money isn't everything
No, money isn't everythingEmbed
