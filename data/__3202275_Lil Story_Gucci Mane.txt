41 ContributorsLil Story Lyrics
Yeah, I got the fire on me
I keep the chopper close by, that's just my philosophy
Misery loves company and I don't need the misery
House full of baby bottles like I run a nursery (Wop!)
Drop top, red 'vert, I'm slidin' down universities
A lot of niggas feelings hurt cause they can't get a verse from me (damn)
Nope, nope, hell nope, boy you sound like a joke to me
And you look really broke to me, how I'ma take you seriously?
Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, cooking up the groceries
Same color T-shirt, just got a half a bird for free
I'm sending mine all low-key behind 10 at the Busy Bee
'Cause I don't need no one to do for me what I won't do for me (pow pow)

Here's a lil' story 'bout a gangster like me
A eight figure nigga, fresh out the penitentiary
A nigga like me, would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way
Here's a lil' story 'bout a gangster like me
A eight figure nigga, fresh out the penitentiary
A nigga like me, would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, aiming out me Cartier
Pussy boy, you sweet, don't play with me, you know you gummy bear
Bitch, I paint the street, I guarantee bloah bolah bloah, pourin' this
Bitch, I drive Mercedes, huh, hop out like the Navy, huh
Pussy, I can sell you work, hold crack like the eighties, huh
I just fuck her makeup up, you just give her baby bump
Hit that lick, got double stripes, judge had tried to give me life
Came home, I got extra bright, platinum records, now we on
Remember couldn't afford a blunt, now a million ain't enough
Ball on them niggas, huh, crawl in them bitches, huh
Icing, that's a carrot cake, side to side, my Chevrolet
Keep a strap on side of me, sold it all through A to Z
