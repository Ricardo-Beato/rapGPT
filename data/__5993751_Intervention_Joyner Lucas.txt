4 ContributorsIntervention Lyrics
This is intervention for these weak niggas; run around
Jump around like their shit is sweet but they funny style
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session

You should get up out that bullshit
Just point me to the good shit
She just wants some good dick
I'll show you where to put it
So sick of all your fussin'
That shoulda/coulda/would shit
I been cursin' like I'm ign'ant
And my aunty told me different
"That's that ratched"
Bitch, I'm ghetto fab'lous
Broke as hell the whole year
Then boss so hard with taxes
I felt like a grown man
When I was just a bastard
Hidin' condoms in my mattress
Tryin' to figure how to catch a bitch attention
I been dreamin' like I'm Malcom
Schemin' like I'm browsin'
Grindin' times a thousand
I been flyin' like a falcon
Over water, under bridges
This beat is too ridic'lous
Fuck around and break a mirror
I ain't into superstition
I'm is what the game is missin'
This the main invention
This is fuckin' homework
I hope you paid attention
I been playin', you been benchin'
These fuckers need detention
Or suspension or some counselin'
Or some Joyner intervention, nigga
You might also like
This is intervention for these weak niggas; run around
Jump around like their shit is sweet but they funny style
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session

Okay, you brag about the Benzs
Then hoppin' out the Nissan (You lyin'!)
I thought we were best friends
A shoulder I could lean on
Bunch of niggas thirsty
Go drink some Aquafina
Bunch of men that act like females
Ho, go drink some lime-a-rita with yo bitch ass
White on white like riff raff
Shined so bright my whip dashed
And it killed my swag on impact
And I died, what the hell, got sent back
And they sent my ass to the med lab
And now I feel like Hulk with a pen pad
And two lightnin' bolts would've went passed me
Don't look at me
I'm hype with a game like this
His flow tight, but it ain't like this
It feel like that, then it ain't my shit
Better frame my pic in an eight by ten
And I made my bed, don't lie by me
She don't suck dick, that's fine by me
'Cause I got chicks that abide by me
Better honk your horn when you ride by me
Better high five me when the game's in session
'Cause this the main invention
And this is fuckin' homework
I hope you paid attention
I been playin', you been benchin'
These fuckers need detention
Or suspension or some counselin'
Or some Joyner intervention, wha'?!
This is intervention for these weak niggas; run around
Jump around like their shit is sweet but they funny style
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session

All y'all niggas need intervention, I'm independent
Don't get defensive, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
Mind your business, I'm thinkin' big
And I think I'm pimpin', I'm Scottie (Scottie)
Bitches think that I'm cocky (Cocky)
Dead silent, my posse (Posse)
Better be stressed, no East–West
No Keith Sweat (No body)
Probably ain't get that line, my nigga (Nah)
Probably throw a fit and cry, my nigga (Yah)
But it's okay, I ride, my nigga
Go drink some henny and drive, my nigga
Go slide by, this my time, my nigga
Don't mind my thoughts, I'm just 
Y'all just  snakes, I piss on venom
More reason y'all niggas need intervention
I'm just Lieutenant Sergeant Joyner
Lucas, nigga, what you doin'?
Spendin' all your fuckin' bread
Tryin' to stunt, what you provin'?
Ba-ba-ball so hard, motherfuckers want to find me
Or motherfuckers want to try me
Motherfuckers want to rob me
Shit, you better robbin' Williams' Jumanji
And that's what it is (What it is)
For the li'l kids, I'm what it is (What it is)
Break down doors at your mother's crib
Better open your door or I'm comin' in
Yeah, I'm runnin' in, better ace this lesson
You niggas need detention
Or suspension or some counselin'
Or some Joyner intervention, wha'?!
This is intervention for these weak niggas; run around
Jump around like their shit is sweet but they funny style
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in sessionEmbed
