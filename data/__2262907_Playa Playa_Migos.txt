17 ContributorsPlaya Playa Lyrics
I can take you places you ain't never been
You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
Bitch go back to watching basic cable
If she thinking she can play a player
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
Playa playa, playa playa (nah, never)
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon)
That bitch she think that she gon' play a player

See one thing you can't do is you can't play a player
I done did everything that you did, and I've been everywhere
She riding on Toyota, have you ever been on a Lear?
A California foreign baby, something you can barely steer
Wait hold up, that's something you can't afford
You say you want that for real, well I can lease that Porsche of course
Take her to the mall, shutdown your favorite store
Have her walking out with bags, she don't wanna shop no more
Damn, Dolce Gabbana's, Alexander McQueen, she want red bottoms
This bitch she say she want her hair just like Rihanna's
And she know daddy money longer then Rapunzel
My diamonds stone cold she thinks she want a stunner
The way I kick it shawty thought I was a punter
Try to play me like I'm crazy, make me think that she famous
But I got one question baby, how the fuck you thinking that you gon' play a player?
You might also like
I can take you places you ain't never been
You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
Bitch go back to watching basic cable
If she thinking she can play a player
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
Playa playa, playa playa (nah, never)
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
That bitch she think that she gon' play a player

No she can not play me like a Playstation
Pull up and I drop her off Atlantic Station
You know I don't want nothing but some penetration
So hit me later, tell me what's the situation
You know It's nothing
She said she never been to Atlanta now she coming
Flying from a foreign country, trying to get into something
Really she don't know nothing, can't play a player
Baby girl I want you on the northside, welcome to my world
Then why the hell she so mad then
She ain't got nothing but a little back end
She hop in the front of the Bentley coupe
And she give me brain that's frontin'
Her phone ring, she hop out my Bentley like her grandmama was calling
I ain't seen her since then, and she still keep calling
Can't play a player
They say she got a man, keep her shopping out on Rodeo
Imma let him do it, I ain't gonna spoil her, I'm a player
No not gon' sell no dream, this ain't no fairy tale
They say that you cuffing her, nigga you working for 12
I can take you places you ain't never been
You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
Bitch go back to watching basic cable
If she thinking she can play a player
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
Playa playa, playa playa (nah, never)
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon)
That bitch she think that she gon' play a player

I'm a player, bitches calling me Bill Bellamy
She want my formula, can't give away my recipe
Italy, Hawaii, Beverly, it don't even matter to me
I'm on the road every day, somebody come call for me
The rings, the chains, the bezels, you ain't even on my level
Gotta fit you in my busy schedule
I can help you get your life together, I'm flyer than a feather
In any weather, I'm a player
We can swap these bitches out nigga and trade them
I've never been the cuffing type, I'm no lifesaver
I put a hole in your nigga, he like a bagel
I'm on the molly calling Scotty like I'm Fabo
You not a J-Lo, you a OK ho
Shut the fuck up before I beat it on my table
Number one rule in the player book
Never cuff a bitch that one of your partners done hit
I can take you places you ain't never been
You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
Bitch go back to watching basic cable
If she thinking she can play a player
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
Playa playa, playa playa (nah, never)
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon)
That bitch she think that she gon' play a player3Embed
