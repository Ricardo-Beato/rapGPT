8 ContributorsRock Solid Lyrics
 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid
 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid

 not stoppin
Girls looking at me, cause the man still poppin
You say you got a record deal, but I ain't seen nothing
Chilling in the club, but you ain't spend nothing
I ain't gotta show the world, just show me something
 boy that's cuffing
 the gravy and the stuffing
Gucci what you doing? Pussy I ain't doing nothing
If you want some money, nigga you gotta sell something
8 in the morning, and my trap still jumping
Zay on the track, so the baseline bumping
It's Gucci

 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid
 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid

I'm the people's champ, call me The Rock
I lay the crack down, when I'm on the block
Thanks to my trap, my bankroll can't fold up
You can smell the weed when my windows rolled up
I just put it in the 
Put the stove on medeom, and make it hotter
 swisher filled up with the purple
 my wrist go in a circle
You know I fuck with Gucci Mane
A hundred hoes get  Gucci Land
 Aley Boy and Yung Fresh 
 we the best

 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid
 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid

 in the left, fork in the right
If I whip it right,  glass of sprite
Italian dykes naked in the kitchen 
Over here we make them birds sing like Berry White
Glock shots , 
My watch rock solid, straight drop 
Hurricane hurricane, me and Ralph wildin
Fresh downstairs, yes sir, the money piling
Me and young Alley Boy moving pounds of  boy
Gucci hit me up, and said 
Gucci not a ,  boy
Zone 6 ,  vally boy
 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid
 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid

 back in the kitchen
Yung Ralph he water whippin, while Yung Fresh hold a pistol
Montana the rock nigga, so he just wait for the drop
 ike it's the 4th of July
Get money, rock solid
We poppin, no stoppin
 top droppin
Got pills, got kush
We got K's in the 
 cookies, 
Alley Boy acting funny, but I been looking like money
So your homeboy , 
Bring it back to the 6, where niggas killing for sticks
 my favorite room is the kitchen
 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid
 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid

Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid

Bitch I really rock and role, I really rock the 
Bitches on my dick like  boxer draws
 with me and Alley dawg
You wish ya'll were trappin, 
 problem solving 
 dirty pile
I'm a dirty child 
 style

Me and Ralph do the math, you know who we are
We be making shit hard, stretch it out far

 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solid
 in the kitchen, tryna make it rock solid
 shawty got me rock solid
 mind rock solid
Hit it with the fork, and it get rock solidEmbed
