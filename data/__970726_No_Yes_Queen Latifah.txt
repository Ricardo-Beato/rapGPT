Talking about sex in the '90s

My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me, my body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
Don't wanna get too complex
But does the stress come with the sex?
I know you wanna see me undressed
You're fiending to taste my sweetness
And since I'm your sex interest
It's 'bout time for me to confess
I wanna smoke you like buddha-bless
But my mind's like a bulletproof vest
It's a no/yes

My body's ready, my mind's blocked
It's gonna take a lot to reach my hot spot, I kid you not
I wanna set it and let you wet it, so come and get it
And when we're through you'll need a paramedic
No, never mind, my thoughts dip, you might trip or flip
And so instead I'm staying celibate
My body's ready, my mind's bugging, so I'm struggling
Do I need your love or your lovin'
I just don't know
You might also like
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me, my body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
Now I know that this could be a big blow
To somebody with a big ego
Who could get any ho' in E.O
But I got to put your status on slow
'Cause baby I don't know
If it's me or the TV show, my records or my videos
And got your nose wide open like blow
I just don't know

Now what are you prepared to do if I decide
To put away the pride and let you inside
Would you tell how good it felt
I made you melt, or keep your mouth closed and keep it to yourself
Who should I trust, my love or lust, body or mind, before you
Came along I was doing fine
On the other hand, you claimed to be the man, if I said no
Would you run? The last brother ran
Just don't...
(repeat chorus 2X)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me, my body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
Well I like it in the morning I suppose
I'm having wet-dreams and taking off my clothes
I can't front only a few brothers know
That I like it when the flow is slow
If it's wack then your rep's exposed, if it's right or do you
Till you explode
Hope your ready to catch my whole load, if you hit the right
Spot you've found the code
Do you know...
You be the object of my wet-dreams
Until my mind and my body can't breathe
I keep it tight and I keep it sexy
'Cause you wanna sex me
And if you wanna test the queen (sexually)
I'm trying to see my mind set free
'Cause cause my mind and body don't agree
I hope this is the spot where you wanna be
'Cause you gotta put in work to earn me
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me, my body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)Embed
