Can't ever do right, can't lose this fight, I'm already low
I think the demons are winning
I can't ever do right, I can't lose this fight, I'm already low
I think I need new beginnings
I think the demons are winning
They beat me up
Don't wish me away, wish me luck, yeah yeah
I'll be good either way
Who am I to say what good ain't?
I'm finding my way, my way (Way)
