You know you can call me when nobody picking up
When it feel like don't nobody in the world give a fuck
Call me, I'll be there to pick you up
56442, hit me up
Call me, when nobody picking up
When it feel like don't nobody in the world give a fuck
Call me, I'll be there to pick you up
56442, hit me up

I know sometimes shit can get crazy and out of control
I know sometimes this world reminds us we should take it slow
Weight of the world make it impossible to stay afloat
And the demons we battle with make it harder to cope
Why you think we get addicted to alcohol and dope?
Addiction's like a mud bath without a bar of soap
In other words, it's impossible to stay clean
For people like us, bein' happy is just a daydream
But, beyond drugs, it's even day-to-day shit
Constantly comparin' yourself to others and they shit
Know your self-worth
'Cause that's the whole meanin' behind this first verse
I'm in the cut, I'm covert, definition introvert
Life's a bitch but I'm a flirt, tryna get up in that skirt
Come now shawty, get this work, get it 'til I'm in the dirt
No matter what they say, no matter what, I'm all me
And no matter where you been or where you goin'
You might also like
You know you can call me when nobody picking up
When it feel like don't nobody in the world give a fuck
Call me, I'll be there to pick you up
56442, hit me up
Call me, when nobody picking up
When it feel like don't nobody in the world give a fuck
Call me, I'll be there to pick you up
56442, hit me up

Call me
Call me
Call me
Call me
Call me
Call me
Call me
