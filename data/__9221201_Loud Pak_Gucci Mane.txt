4 ContributorsLoud Pak Lyrics
Zaytoven

Call the weed man, tell him come and 
I think my nerves bad, I need that loud pack
Mr.  bring me that 
I call the lean man, for that promethizine
Mr. Lean Man, bring me my medison
I call the kush man, I'm smoking kush again
Mr. Bird Man, bring me that 

You wanna get high, baby?
You want that vibe, baby?
You 24's to the moon with the mama, baby
What's your habit? I get at it, if you gotta have it
My  'cause I chop 
 got ya if you leaning or rocking
 got you if your chiefing or popping
 turning profit
Wide open, mama flow like a fausit
I'm the plug, ain't no way they could stop it
Call me
You might also like
So bring a thousand bags of it
 all hundreds, ain't no need to count this shit
 you can be my new connect, but damn, I miss my old connect
Trackter trailers full of kush, 
Smoking back to back, man, I smoke them shits like cigarettеs
I would turn you on no more, but you be with that hook up shit
800  pack of it

Call the weed man, tеll him come and 
I think my nerves bad, I need that loud pack
Mr.  bring me that 
I call the lean man, for that promethizine
Mr. Lean Man, bring me my medison
I call the kush man, I'm smoking kush again
Mr. Bird Man, bring me that 

Kush man, kush man, please bring Juice a 
Stupid loud pack, for that AK47
Purple kush  purple, yeah Juice, they smoking
Post up on the crest with them bricks, bust whide open
Stay down, stay down, and watch the Juice come up
4 plus a 2, and the Juice stay poured up
Boldercrest shawty,  Sun Vally

Eh hey, call me Smokey or Lil Chimni
That's how it's feeling when the kush in me
Man, I'm higher than a motherfucker
Feels so good,  higher than you other suckers
Plus I'm hanging with the Gucci Mane
Gucci Mane, call your boy, bust a Mary Jane
Everyday I be high, I'm so high, I touch the sky
If  Gangsta Boo is not 
So

Call the weed man, tell him come and 
I think my nerves bad, I need that loud pack
Mr.  bring me that 
I call the lean man, for that promethizine
Mr. Lean Man, bring me my medison
I call the kush man, I'm smoking kush again
Mr. Bird Man, bring me that Embed
