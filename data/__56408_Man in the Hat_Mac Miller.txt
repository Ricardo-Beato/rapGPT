30 ContributorsMan in the Hat Lyrics
Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial?
If you lookin' for a answer, you probably gon' find it now
And to the man in the hat standin' lookin' at his watch:
Motherfucker, well, the time is now
Go and clap your hands, let me hear you say, "That's the jam"
See, I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down, kids, you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, I have them sayin', "Mac's the man"
The maximum, comin' through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money, better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door, yellin', "Fuck a list"
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this, hey

All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
All my people in the front (Front)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back (Back)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk (Funk)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that (That)
Go and clap your hands (Hey), go clap your hands

H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up 'cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls, "It's cool, look but don't touch"
I'll be home soon as I can, I don't rush
'Cause girl, you're baby, girl, you're good, just don't fuss
I wanna hear y'all clap, just like that
Keep it goin', I'ma bring it all back
H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up 'cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls, "It's cool, look but don't touch"
I'll be home soon as I can, I don't rush
Baby, baby, girl, you're good, just don't fuss
I hear these couples fightin' all the time, not us
We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What? What? Goin' hard tonight
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, drivin' 'round in my car tonight
Makin' music that ain't hard to like
I got the heart to write
A couple bars, I might go do
Somethin' crazy, I may be lazy, love me or hate me
You know it's the same me
And it goes a little somethin' like this...
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
All my people in the front (Front)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
Everybody in the back (Back)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you're feelin' that funk (Funk)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands
If you like it like that (That)
Go and clap your hands, go clap your hands

Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial?
If you lookin' for a answer, you probably gon' find it now
And to the man in the hat standin' lookin' at his watch:
Motherfucker, well, the time is now (Time is now)7Embed
