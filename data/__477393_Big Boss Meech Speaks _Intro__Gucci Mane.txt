3 ContributorsBig Boss Meech Speaks (Intro) Lyrics
Holiday season
This the New Year twenty twelve
The boss of all bosses
The real Big Meech
Rocking with the homies
Gucci let no man separate what we create
From every hood to Hollywood
Coming to a ghetto near you
Death this whole dishonor
The greatest show on earth
After us it will be no others
It is we got 'em
Death is streets on live homie
You know what I'm saying?
Keep doing what you doing
You know what I'm saying?
Because that's what time it is
We gotta keep the real out there pumping
Real is here to stay
When you're here to stay you ain't gotta come back
Free Big Meech and see the streets
Aka the BMF stimulus package oneYou might also likeEmbed
