19 ContributorsThe One Lyrics
Aww
Shout-out to Slaughterhouse
Joe Budden
Royce, Crooked, Joell
Ugh
Yeah

The game was looking weak, the whole scene starved
So, I came through with some Muscle Milk and protein bars
Barbells and jump ropes, Bowflexes to body it
And a couple Billy Blanks Tae-Bo Karate kicks
If you ain't million-dollar-dreaming, then we opposites
In high school, I was voted "the most Ted DiBiase-est"
Also "the most slept-on," 'cause my Ted DiBiase-ness
An "Inglourious Basterd," and you looking like a Nazi, bitch
They say, "It's hard out here for old boy"
Then, tell me where Taraji is
I am going so rawâ€”watch me soy-sauce, wasabi this
Nobu a damn Pro-Tools, hot as H-E-double hockey-sticks
Make sure you give the chef your compliments
And thank him for his constantly great tasting accomplishments
Or smiley face emoticons if you want to remain anonymous
My retirement's on hold, I got the whole world on conference
Matchstick Man: I really have the confidence
That I'ma give them good music like Common Sense and Consequence
Content that's relative across the continent
New York, Houston, Chi-Town, Los Angeles
