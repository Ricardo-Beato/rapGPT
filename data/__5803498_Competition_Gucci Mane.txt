Competition, competition
 tryna be the best 
Competition, So Icy competition
My flow so sick, who you think is the illest?
Competition, let's start the competition
 competition

Gucci Mane the  my mansion is a  house
Yello diamonds shine so bright at night, I pissed the moon off
 go so hard, that I just might 
Studio in my bedroom, I did this verse with my shoes off
Driveway full of Lamborghinis,  full of True 
So I see the competition, I feel like I gotta win
Twisting up that 
I started off  after me
 from Gucci, he a 
 dawg, you can't be hot as me
 wanna see

Competition, competition
 tryna be the best 
Competition, So Icy competition
My flow so sick, who you think is the illest?
Competition, let's start the competition
 competition

Competition? Where?
Competition? Who?
I got so much game, I make a Crip say soo woo
I'm the illest nigga, I'm the realest nigga
 call them  Hillfiger
Hundred round clip, so I don't fucking miss
Fuck a punchline, Flocka straight blunt
Knock his teeth out, call that shit one punch
Drinking red punch, talking red syrup
Looking in the mearor, see a Brick Squad nigga
Eat your ass for dinner 
 Gucci 

Competition, competition
 tryna be the best 
Competition, So Icy competition
My flow so sick, who you think is the illest?
Competition, let's start the competition
 competition

 my chopper,  my Glock
 short, but bullits 
 hotter, ask your chick
Cause when she grip, I think she blew the soul out a nigga dick
Gotta pay for the  I ain't that type of guy
I would stick around, but I gotta fly
They lost, but you know I'm in that fast car
Swerving in and out  like a nascar
One bitch in my  the other in my lap
One blowing my dick, the other on my sack
They react real quick to a finger snap
Michael Phelps on the track, I be swimming laps
Competition, competition
 tryna be the best 
Competition, So Icy competition
My flow so sick, who you think is the illest?
Competition, let's start the competition
 competition

My flow heavy, 
Laffy taffy Range  same color as lavender
You say you're the shit, but honestly 
Gotta eat your weedys, just to see me breathing
Indian style, I'll rap you tight like a 
Spray you like grefeedi
Niggas say you're hungry for beef, so Imma feed you hollo tips, cause you're greedy
What the fuck these kids think?
Frenchie running up a big bank
Your house is my garage, your swimming pool is my fish tank
 got a nigga stuntin in videos
 run my city,  4 years ago

Competition, competition
 tryna be the best 
Competition, So Icy competition
My flow so sick, who you think is the illest?
Competition, let's start the competition
