7 ContributorsEverything About Me Is True Lyrics
Oh, they gonna bring this shit back
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

I say hey! What if I told you, everything
They say about me is true? (Yeah)
Had a droptop Lamb' it was blue, had a
Black Glock .40, it was new
I say hey! What if I told you, everything
They say about me is true?
They were for the 24, I copped two
(Yeah)
And then I split 'em both up between
The crew
I say hey!

I don't really fuck with that nigga (Why not?)
I don't know what's up with that nigga (What's up?)
All I know,  half the niggas in the streets
In the rap game
They don't really fuck with that nigga (Damn)
My homeboy say he a buster, my old
Head said he a hustler
But them niggas round the way said
"Bullshit, you want it, you play, he gon'
Touch ya"
My dog say that he a snake, my round
Say he had to flake (Woo)
Either he the realist nigga walkin', or the
Fakest nigga talkin'
Hood ssay he fake gangbangin', hit the
Gang with the work, gang gangin' (Yeah)
Heard he had switched on his mans, I heard
His man forced his hand
On his mans

I say hey! What if I told you, everything
They say about me is true? (Yeah)
Had a droptop Lamb' it was blue, had a
Black Glock .40, it was new
I say hey! What if I told you, everything
They say about me is true?
Had a droptop Lamb' it was blue, had a
Black Glock .40, it was new
I say hey! What if I told you, everything
They say about me is true?
They were for the 24, I copped two
(Yeah)
And then I split 'em both up between
The crew
I say hey!

I heard the nigga say that he a legend
He a legend
I heard he used to front a nigga 7
(Damn)
Yeah, the birds are the words
He gon' keep the shit a stack, with the
Gospel he a reverend (Yeah)
I heard he used to feed the whole town
With the off-white and the brown
And the brown
My nigga in the feds say he snitched but
There ain't no paperwork to be found
(Nah)
Fuck that he a boss, yeah, and fuck
Them, it's they loss
He a boss
Bank statements and receipts
When you see him in the streets, just
Know he paid the cost (Aye)
Put 'em on the interstate, fuck local
Nowadays he a real estate mogul (Yeah)
Niggas own half the town, left the circus for the clowns
I say hey! What if I told you, everything
They say about me is true? (Yeah)
Had a droptop Lamb' it was blue, had a
Black Glock .40, it was new
I say hey! What if I told you, everything
They say about me is true?
Had a droptop Lamb' it was blue, had a
Black Glock .40, it was new
I say hey! What if I told you, everything
They say about me is true?
They were for the 24, I copped two
(Yeah)
And then I split 'em both up between
The crew
I say hey!Embed
