Yeah, grrat
Yeah, damn
I feel like John Wick, empty clips
Yeah, empty clips
Yeah, empty clips

Shell cases scatter the floor, bullets, they shatter the glass
I could feel the tension in this room like a chatter in class
Every day breakin' records, shit is just happening fast
That shit was a quick switch, yeah
I feel like I'm always on thin ice with a thick bitch
So many shots fired, I need me a clip switch
I'm in that fuckin' bag right now, I'm a lipstick
Sabbatical in Miami, this shit was holistic
Man, I remember niggas was jokin' 'bout some tick, tick
And now that rapper broke as fuck, the boy a statistic
Empty clips, yeah
Empty clips

I'm almost expressionless
John Cena wouldn't know emotions I wrеstle with
Plagued by the fact I was born a pеrfectionist
Still can't even wrap my mind around the success of this
Point me to your boss, nigga, you a receptionist
I really hate the fact I make this shit sound effortless
I put so much thought into the messages
It's borderline obsessiveness, remember who you messin' with
White America say I'm becoming a threat
Black America love to remind me what my mama look like
As if I'd ever fuckin' forget
I'm never enough
Much to their dismay, I'm levelin' up, yeah
There's too much treasure to hunt, there's too many hoes in the spot
The ratio seven to one
Livin' for right now 'cause I really think heaven's a front
Nadia died in Dubai
I waited on a spirit to come by for like seventeen  months
That shit didn't visit me once, damn
She wanted to better her life
She wanted some opportunity, we wasn't given a bunch
Her ex would eat away at her soul, that nigga a munch
The last message she sent to my phone's 'bout keeping in touch
So pardon me questioning God and not believing in much
It's Wick, man, don't listen to Wikipedia
Capo a wicked nigga, I pray it don't hit the media
They say, "Drake, you gettin' harder," funny, it's getting easier
Rappers are slick comedians, and they get disobedient
And they don't stay in they lane, it's like niggas hit the median
Boat say he the recipe, I must be the key ingredient
Capo might wick a man down with evil deviance
They gon' have to talk to Ouija boards like heebie jeebian
Like the large was too big for you, you'll need a medium
Just to send a message to somebody you loved previous
Empty clips, yeahYou might also like1Embed
