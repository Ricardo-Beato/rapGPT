10 ContributorsDown as Great Lyrics
I'm tryna go down, down as a great
Every night I get, on my knees and pray
That I will go down, yeah
I will go down, yeah

Legendary moves, leader of my crew
Heavy is the head that wear the crown, that shit true
Do it like Nip Hussle, that's to fill some big shoes
And what good is excuses when the fuckin' rent's due?
Smokin' on this indo, run away from my pain
Rosemary on my temples, heard that's good for migraines
Solo in my Benzo, exit off the highway
Solitary thoughts like how to reinvest my side change

I'm tryna go down, down as a great
Every night I get, on my knees and pray
That I will go down, yeah
I will go down, yeah
I'm tryna go down, down as a legend
Every night I ask God for the blessin'
That I will go down, yeah
I will go down, yeah

So many niggas doin' time, who are you and I?
To play with it is a blessin', so reach for the sky
Pick up Shady off the block and we'll smoke and drive
Politickin' on the block to make it multiply
Keep some bitches on the team from the other side
Keep at least a pound of green, mothafuckin' right
30 hours in the spot, goin' overtime
Then we pull up to the Fox and go hold it down
You know this life, it got a cold design
How you go from eatin' lobster tails at Ocean Prime
To chain to a smoker and throat on the line
But when them gates close, keep an open mind
It ain't a force in this world like the focused drive
You gotta focus on yourself like an only child
You make your dream realer, and you make your team better
You wake your game up, and you make your scheme better

They say this time, this time
Won't be like the last time
But this time, this time
I'ma do it like my last time
I'ma go hard, my nigga
Put my name in the stars, my nigga
But I gotta pray to God, my nigga
That I will go down
Until we legendary, yeah
'Til we legendary
We legendary, yeah
Who don't wanna be legendary? Yeah
Wanna be.... legendary, legendary, yeah
I wanna be legendary
I'm just tryna go down, I'm just tryna go down, I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
And be a legend in my town
I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
And be a legend in my townEmbed
