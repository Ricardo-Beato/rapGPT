Whoop
Whoop
Ladies and gentlemen
This is Macadelic
You motherfucker, hahahaha

Uh
I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sippin'
Groupies fall in love, I'm like, "Bitch, you must be trippin'"
I'm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck, yeah, nothin' 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain, haha
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
And it don't make a difference if you cryin' in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'ma kill more, I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mill' more, then a number one spot on the Billboard

Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

Argh
I'ma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team in that pack with me, hear the Jerm beat banging, with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be tryna fuck the female faculty
I'm a crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way, when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
Pump out raps, yeah, I got raps, tryna talk shit, what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank roll, I'ma lay low, chill, 'til I let that stack

Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low53Embed
