Thanking God for all my setbacks
'Cause He the reason I'm able to get back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, woah
Yeah
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Yeah

This the feeling know that I been missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have
On Sunday with Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or the spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Timb's, in the Lamb, mixing it in with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan, bucket hat like Gilligan (Yeah)
Lately, I been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone, though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, Grandma and Mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan
Funny thing about it, you always act like you knew
You told me I would feel it would happen before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and Grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me of how we used to dress up
As a family and go to Sunday service, and be in church singin'
Ain't been to church in a while, but it ain't just 'bout how you just praise Him
In the building, it's about how you praisin' Him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
To my all time low self and throw me a jetpack, woah
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone, or any other
Girl look like Lisa Bonet whose jealous of me and Jhen√©
Who you would always advise would be in the way
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of ya 'til I see you myself
You might also like
Praise
So many times
I prayed for you
I put up prayers for you
Praise
For all the times
That you prayed for me
All the nights you stayed by me
All the nights that you cried
And all the days I coulda died
Because of you, I survived
Because of you, I'm still alive

Thanking God for all my setbacks
'Cause He the reason I'm able to get back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, woah
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Yeah
