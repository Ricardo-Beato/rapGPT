Oh!
Oh!
Gucci
Bangladesh!
Gucci
Brr, brr, brr (Gucci)

I'm the fire, you say you more fire then nigga, you a liar (What)
Homie you and I, know the truth but that's 'tween you and I
Stupid jewelry on me then, stupid jewelry on me now (Brr)
If you think you finna shit on Gucci then just show me how (Brr)
Someone dissed me yesterday, what I'm 'posed to do, go cry?
With my money chasin' million dollar mission on the side
Church's chicken in my Lambo, bought two drumsticks and a thigh (Nyooom)
I'm so hood right now they question whats gettin' Gucci high
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Girls fightin', hoes fistfight just to touch my tie
Being smart smart, I ain't been this hard in a while
Blow cha-cha, I ain't been this hard in a while

Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Every single night I'm ballin'
Sippin' on that drank, rims crawlin'
Mostly every night I'm count, count
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shooting, shooting
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shooting, shooting (Yeah)
You might also like
Wilder than a jaguar, wildin' in a Jaguar
Pl-Please don't play with me, I'll put that pistol on your grandpa
I swear I'm so wild I think I just may need a xan bar
And if she on my team I bet that bitch know who she playin' for
Mr. Coach Carter or Mr. Go-Harder
And I like my kush dry like a fish with no water
Swagger stupid perfect, I might as well surf it
And if she ain't fuckin' she get the voicemail service
Tell it like it be, bitch I do it for the bloods
And every fuckin' time I say soo woo it's for the Bloods
What you dislike I love, man I do just like I does
And if you wanna fight then come on you can fight my guns
Weezy man, Young Money

Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Every single night I'm ballin'
Sippin' on that drank, rims crawlin'
Mostly every night I'm count, count
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shooting, shooting
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shooting, shooting
Let's do the furs, his and hers
Started gettin' on my nerves so I hit her with a "BURR!"
Hustlers love me, all the haters hate me
They brothers wanna fight me, they sisters wanna date me
I tell her bust it baby, you could be my bust it baby
But stay in your place, I need my space: don't suffocate me (please)
Back black approach us, clack clack take gats out the holsters
Cops in black the patrol us, treat us like rats and roaches
But the blue Benz, Got the blue lamps
And your wifey, well we use her for her food stamps
Ain't no big deal, but she keep the fridge filled
Eggs scrambled, cheese grilled, cold juice the grits kill!
Don't forget veal, Italiano, Gallardo
Yea the big wheels, like milk your wig spilled
We'll rush in ya spot, knock knock, snub of the Glock
It's Gucci turn, Huh?, You gon' suck it or not

Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Every single night I'm ballin'
Sippin' on that drank, rims crawlin'
Mostly every night I'm count, count
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shooting, shooting
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shooting, shooting
Bitches wanna fuck me mainly
Cause I got the kitchen all famous
I'm tryna hold my head above water
Stack a billion cash I just oughta
My shades cost that cause I'm Gucci
My warddrobe Gucci'd out like I'm boostin'
I shine just all the time your homie shine
Wanna hate me get a ticket and join the line, fine
It's Gucci!3Embed
