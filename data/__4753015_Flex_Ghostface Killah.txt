5 ContributorsFlex Lyrics
Yeah, nigga
I just wanna flex, son
Yeah, yeah

I just wanna flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got a bag though, runnin' up a check
'Cause I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got a bag though, runnin' up a check
'Cause I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna flex

Ayy, yo, patty cake, patty cake, multiplying five pies
Mountains on the table, take a whiff, that's a line drive
Pullin' out cocaine biscuits, doin' drive-bys
Bitches buttnaked in the kitchen, shorty suck me dry
2 a.m. flights, elite jet, furry Louis seats
Alkaline bottles of Don, the whole crew eat
Flex ice water stones as long as baguettes
The new joint escalator piece, we flooded the steps
Baby blue passports, Hong Kong Task Force
Heard about the murder regime, made Ghost style mask for us
Bitches with tongue rings fresh out the geisha house
Did everything to these hoes but never ate them out
Niggas can't say shit, it's gold in my bank account
The foul play and the accolades is what my gang about
The knots, big faces falling out my Gucci sweats
TECs, vests, motherfuck, I'm daring you to...
You might also like
Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got a bag though, runnin' up a check
'Cause I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got a bag though, runnin' up a check
'Cause I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna flex

Yeah, uh, come here, brother
Have you ever seen rare Wallas with an Air Max bubble?
And a steel that come with the grip with the beam this color?
Tomato dot'll cover the opps, if not, I'll cut you
Forbes, got young bitches blowin' my cover
He's the black Tom Selleck, I've been dyin' to fuck you
Them Caribbean seminars, he flashy like menopause
Bet you get hit with the best shot like Pat Benatar
The Oscar winner, his collar is knitted with linen
His jeans, you can consider it illiterate denim
Fish tank so big even the babies can swim in
Rockin' the toddler, four finger lacin', ridiculous gems in 'em
Benjamins stuck together like boxes of Entenmann's
Been in the vault since '88 with the tape of Rakim and them
I got that music ear
I can't leave a chick crib without them tryin' to keep me as a souvenir
Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got a bag though, runnin' up a check
'Cause I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got a bag though, runnin' up a check
'Cause I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna flexEmbed
