5 ContributorsAin Nun Lyrics
Ain’t nothing but a stunner, pocket full of hundreds
Walk inside fifths try to buy that motherfucker
Ain’t nothing but a baller, been a shot caller
Ask your main bitch I don’t ever have to call her
Ain’t nothing but a hustler, fuck you lil busters
Pull up in a Rari, inside mustard
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ stuntin’ ass nigga
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ ass stuntin’ nigga

Ain’t nothing but a cash fanatic, mathematics
Ain’t nothing but a school teacher to you niggas swaggin’
Ain’t nothing for me to stunt hard than your baby daddy
Ain’t nothing for me to ice my wrist out Roger Rabbit
Ain’t nothing for me to come up with the lingo have you snaggin’
Chewed on the kid whole crew you the wackest
Ain’t nothing for the kid to get ya hit with the ratchet
Ain't nothing for me to come through top down smashing
Looking at you lil busters can’t stop laughing
Skrt when I pull off still pay the tag
Ain’t nothing for me to buy another if I crash it
Ain't nothing for me to some shit you niggas just imagine

Ain’t nothing but a stunner, pocket full of hundreds
Walk inside fifths try to buy that motherfucker
Ain’t nothing but a baller, been a shot caller
Ask your main bitch I don’t ever have to call her
Ain’t nothing but a hustler, fuck you lil busters
Pull up in a Rari, inside mustard
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ stuntin’ ass nigga
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ ass stuntin’ nigga
You might also like
Fifth plaza shoppin’, flyer than a helicopter
I ain’t nothing but a money throwin’ rubber band poppin’
Told woadie like to shop they some goons but they my partners
Ain’t gotta pull the trigger still to hit ya with the yoppa
I’m a Benihana nigga Future through with red lobster
Gettin’ money is a hobby drank Ace of Spades like it water
Need a chain like Maraka thats the power of a dollar
Ain’t nothing but a street nigga hot as damn lava
I ain’t spend a dollar on her but she still call me Papi
Ain’t doing nothing but mixing collard greens with ?
Promethazine Baby bottles, Lortabs, Oxycontin got the kid and I’m always riding foreign

Ain’t nothing but a stunner, pocket full of hundreds
Walk inside fifths try to buy that motherfucker
Ain’t nothing but a baller, been a shot caller
Ask your main bitch I don’t ever have to call her
Ain’t nothing but a hustler, fuck you lil busters
Pull up in a Rari, inside mustard
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ stuntin’ ass nigga
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ ass stuntin’ nigga

Nothing but a flexing, Scooter straight finessing
I bought everything before the deal just off a Juggs
Saran wrap the rap thats how you sign thats one jug
I paid off his whole rent for one year
I need another stash spot them things on the way
Walk inside fifths spend fifty thats how we play
I just made a hundred racks this month off of J’s
Them Black Amigo numbers you can eat and do your thing
I ain’t nothing but stuntin’, countin’, jugging’ ass nigga
I ain’t nothing stackin’ cow money ass nigga
Young Scooter all I talk is cash on you niggas
650 I got gangster swag for you niggas
Ain’t nothing but a stunner, pocket full of hundreds
Walk inside fifths try to buy that motherfucker
Ain’t nothing but a baller, been a shot caller
Ask your main bitch I don’t ever have to call her
Ain’t nothing but a hustler, fuck you lil busters
Pull up in a Rari, inside mustard
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ stuntin’ ass nigga
Ain’t nothing hustler, ballin’ ass stuntin’ niggaEmbed
