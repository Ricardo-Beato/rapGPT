Because I'm grinding
Got this shining
Tell my connect
That I love him
Tell my connect that I love him
Tell my connect that I love him
Because I'm grinding
Got this shining
Tell my connect
That I love him
Well shoot the house apart
Shit, burn it down and call it justice

So holla at the bustas if you looking for a sucker
They  and the body 
Gucci!
Cocaine white as dairy
Provided by Dirty Harry
I bet you call me dirty when I spun this for the Marys
The pounds got me married to my negro for the cabbage
I'm living lavish, gambling houses look like Caesar's Palace
Gucci!
Driving to the hole, I'll pull up on your for the J
I'm dirty when I play, I might cross over for a Tre
Gucci going postal, coast to coast about my mail
I break you playing CeeLo, then I buy your drawers- Chapelle
I'm higher than Stone Mountain and my penguin like a fountain
My boy down in the park will leave your heart somewhere, not pounding
You might also like
Gucci gamble!
I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
Three hundred-fifty in my duffel, finna buy a Lambo
Your life in fucking shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
An AR-15 in case a nigga want to gamble
I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
Three hundred-fifty in my duffel, 'bout to cop a Lambo
Your life ain't worth the shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
AR-15 in case a nigga want to gamble

Nigga try fluids!
My chickens rap Jewish
All white beads and the light shine blue-ish
Money, money money. I'm making love to it
A thousands pounds of mid. You know I'm gonna move it
Snowing in the summer. Raining in the club
Fuck, I'm off to get your diamonds, I just spent a fucking load
Drop a grand in six seconds. Tell a bitch to bounce
She'll find out there I bought a ward that's thicker than a house
My closet like the Gucci store
I am such a Gucci whore
Gucci glasses, Gucci bag, I gotta go and get some more
I'm gonna roll the dice and hope that I don't crap out
Can't through my hand in, I'm too low down
Gucci gamble!
I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
Three hundred-fifty in my duffel, finna buy a Lambo
Your life in fucking shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
An AR-15 in case a n* want to gamble
I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
Three hundred-fifty in my duffel, 'bout to cop a Lambo
Your life ain't worth the shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
AR-15 in case a n* want to gamble

We can reconvene at a place that's more serene
In Athens I'm a God. In Alabama I'm the king
In Georgia I'm the boss. In Las Vegas I'm a baller
And he's a ballerina, dodging bullets like a dodger
Shout out to the bloggers. I know I'm a problem
I'm strapped like Super Contra, so tell the fucking robbers
I'm inky tatted-crazy, diamonds blinking out my pinkie
I'm inky in the water, guess that's why the hoes' so kinky
You rinky, dinky, stinky record labels are beneath me
Now you being nasty. Dissing when you cannot beat me
I'm still undefeated, and that's an honest statement
But I speak it and I preach it, so fuck all of you leeches
Gucci gamble!
I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
Three hundred-fifty in my duffel, finna buy a Lambo
Your life in fucking shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
An AR-15 in case a n* want to gamble
I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
Three hundred-fifty in my duffel, 'bout to cop a Lambo
Your life ain't worth the shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
AR-15 in case a n* want to gamble1Embed
