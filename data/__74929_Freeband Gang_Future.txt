You suckers wouldn't understand, it's a man thing (It's some big dog shit) Y'all just saying things
(Y'all just talking out your mouth) I'ma show who really ran things
I just joined the Freeband Gang
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, yeah
I just joined the Freeband Gang
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, yeah
I just joined the Freeband Gang

Designers on my face cause I will never see a hater 50,000 dollars worth of jewelry, future, taylored
Gucci aviator, I stay high than elevators kings, Jacksons, Jones you know the Mexico I'm major
Commando guns only freebands can save ya, transformal cars pulling up in some in place
We got that freeband money and we got that long paper tossing up yo baby mama with no conversation
She like the way I flex with my astronaut persona, I rather take my shoes off if it ain't Dolce & Gabbana
Two cups filled up, we drank, strong marijuana, what's the use of having muscles if you can't flex all summer

You suckers wouldn't understand, it's a man thing (It's some big dog shit) Y'all just saying things
(Y'all just talking out your mouth) I'ma show who really ran things
I just joined the Freeband Gang
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, yeah
I just joined the Freeband Gang
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, yeah
I just joined the Freeband Gang
