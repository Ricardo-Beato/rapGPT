Ohh, ooh, ohh
Uh, uh, uh
It—It—It was all a dream
Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racing through my head (It was all a dream)
Felt so real to me (It was all)
This is what was said (All-all-all-all-a-all a dream)

"Had a dream," I said, "'Bout who?" he said
"'Bout B.I.G.," I said, "That's big," he said
"Dig what he said", "Proceed," he said
"Indeed," I said, so, breathe I did
"Don't repeat what I say," I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said
"It came to me like a whisper last evening," I said
"What's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead
"Mo' Money Mo' Problems,'" better believe it," he said
"Careful what you wish for, you might receive it," he said
"I see," I said, "jealousy" I said
"Got the whole industry mad at me," I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"
"I agree," I said, "my one of a kind self"
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
"What he said," I said, "has been said before"
"Just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more"

Was it all a dream? Tell me
Was it all a dream? Was it a dream?
Was it all a dream?
(It was all, all-all, all, all-all, all, all-all) I got to know
Was it all a dream? Was it a dream? (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream? A dream
Was it all a dream? (Oh)

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped (Oh, oh, oh)
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock (Oh, oh, oh)
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack (Oh, oh, oh)
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke, "duh-ha, duh-ha" (Oh, oh, oh)
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far (Oh, oh, oh)
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight (Oh, oh, oh)
Time to get paid, blow up like the--
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner (Ooh)
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri (Ooh)
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good (Ooh)
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh
Was it all a dream? Tell me (It was all a dream, uh)
Was it all a dream? Was it a dream? (It was all)
Was it all a dream?
(It was all, all-all, all, all-all, all, all-all, all, all-all) I gotta know
Was it all a dream? Was it a dream?
Was it all a dream? A dream (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream?
It was all, all-all, all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all, all a dream

It was all
It was all, all, all-all, all, all-all-all-all-all-all-all, all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all, all, all, all, all, a-a-a-a-a-a-a-all a dream
It was all, all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all
All-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all
All-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all
All-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all a dream

"I see," I said, "jealousy" I said
