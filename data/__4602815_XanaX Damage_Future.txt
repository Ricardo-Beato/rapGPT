Blood, blood, blood
Xanax dreams, Xanax
Covered in blood, oh

Baby, when the sun is out, it's like I'm not myself
Xanax doin' damage, make it night so I can handle you
Baby, when the moon is out, I finally know myself
Xanny pills, then I feel my body startin' to give up, yeah

I only call you when I'm faded
Your arms around me, come and save me
I only want you to have my baby
When I'm drunk and I'm down and depressed
I just need to confess to you
Oh, oh-oh

Baby, if I want you, then I know there's somethin' wrong
I don't mean to ruin all the times we had alone
But I'm not my best with you, I'm so depressed with you
But it's so hard, I don't think I can exist without you

I only call you when I'm faded
Your arms around me, come and save me
I only want you to have my baby
When I'm drunk and I'm down and depressed
I just need to confess to you
Oh, oh-oh

Baby, when the sun is out, it's like I'm not myself
Xanax doin' damage, make it night so I can handle you
Baby, when the moon is out, I finally know myself
Xanny pills, then I feel my body startin' to give up, yeah10Embed
