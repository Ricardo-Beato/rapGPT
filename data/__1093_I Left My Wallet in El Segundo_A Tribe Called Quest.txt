76 ContributorsI Left My Wallet in El Segundo Lyrics
Toqué ese guitarra!

I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got, got to get it

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said "Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?"
You might also like
Well, describe to me what the wallet looks like

Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: pay for lunch, so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
"Yo Tip man, you got what you need?"
I checked for keys and started to step
And what do you know, my wallet I forget

It was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
It had my jimmy hats, I gotta get it man

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts to scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, "all right, Tip, see you tomorrow
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said "Why?," I said "We gotta go
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo"
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got, got to get it

Come on, let's go
Come on, let's go
