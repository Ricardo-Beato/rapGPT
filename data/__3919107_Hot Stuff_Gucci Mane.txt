3 ContributorsHot Stuff Lyrics
Zone 6
It's the trap shit, trap shit, trap shit, trap shit
Bouldercrast
It's Gucci, huh
Dramatic, nigga
Clester Ave
I need a trap girl, trap girl, trap girl, trap girl
DJ the fuck Drama
Lil' mama so fast, lil' mama so fast, slow down, huh
Lil' mama so jazzy, lil' mama so bad

She got that hot stuff (Hot, hot, hot, hot)
She got that hot stuff (Hot, hot, hot, uh, hot, uh)
Baby, you the grown-up, damn, you the grown-up
Baby girl, you're showin' off, showin' off
Got that hot stuff (Hot, hot, hot, hot)
Baby, come and get it 'cause you know I got that hot stuff
Got that hot stuff (Hot, hot, hot, hot)
Baby, come and get it 'cause you know I got that grown-up
Baby, you the grown-up, damn, you the grown-up (A grown-up, a grown-up)
Baby girl, you're showin' off, showin' off (Ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm so grown up)

Got Hollywood watching you, watching me (Watching me)
Jockin' you or was you jockin' me?
Seen me come up in the hood (Oh)
Then you was too young for me (Yeah)
Younger than me, six years
So that makes up twenty-two (Huh?, twenty-three, oh yeah)
Twenty-two or twenty-eight
Ain't seen her since her in '93 (Well, damn, yeah)
Ninety-three thousand dollar, old school just for her pussy (Well, damn)
Let your hair down, eat the Levi's, I'll crank up the beat (Oh, woah)
Graduated, look at me, 'said she went to Georgia State
I play for So Icey, baby, ballin' like the NBA
Really in her face, small in the waist (Oh, oh)
Will fire her like the birds got crazy (Oh)
Nails stay done, quick A1
Never been married or she never had a baby (No)
No old lady, my old lady (I'm so done)
Your old lady, my lady, your lady
Texas face, Sex In The City (No)
Sex In The City, she eat that nigga, uh (Oh)

Got that hot stuff (Hot, hot, hot, hot)
Baby, come and get it 'cause you know I got that grown-up
Baby, you the grown-up, damn, you the grown-up (A grown-up, a grown-up)
Baby girl, you're showin' off, showin' off (Ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm so grown up)

Last time I seen you, you were itty-bitty
Now you got some pretty titties
Seen you working at Magic City
Heaven's on my dunk in the six playing ''Get safe''
Get safe, get safe, Rooga cockin', oh well
Fuck Fenji, nigga fidget, midget come from my bridges
We should get it, yeah, really, head so Big Willy
Shawty got that hot mouth, then she needs to fuck with me (Hot, hot, hot, hot)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, pussy nigga stuck with me
Buck fifty, new Benny, Bentley, Riley, one-sixty
House cost me nine-sixty, blue Beamer, seven-sixty
I get it, I get it, you don't fuck with me
Suck Denny's dildo, bitch, you a lil' kitty

I pledge allegiance to feed the streets for the rest of my lifeEmbed
