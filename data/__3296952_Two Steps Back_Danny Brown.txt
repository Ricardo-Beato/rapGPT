6 ContributorsTwo Steps Back Lyrics
Seen niggas lose lives over eight ball money
Seen crack babies grow up to serve their mommy
Can't explain why we live with so much sorrow
Guess the stories of today'll be a movie tomorrow
Mama always said there'd be days like this
Ain't got my own pot so in the alley I piss
I'll risk my own life to be rich
Workin' like a slave for them chains and whips
I daydream around palm trees
Blowin' haze in the day, summertime breeze
But in reality I just blow my breath
Let the Michigan cold numb my flesh
I need a tissue 'cause my nose is runnin'
Faced harsh winters, locked hot summer
Fuck the president, and the next running
None of them niggas gon' let me hold something

I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
Take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that
You might also like
At night I lay in bed and just pray I can sleep
Think about my life with the TV on the blink
Starin' at the ceiling, I just think
"Should I write my own will?" but I ran outta ink
Ask God questions almost every day
I almost get my answers a damn year later
I roll gan that tastes like now-and-laters
Spit for crack babies
Layin' incubators
This is for my niggas workin' nine to five
They wanna beat they boss ass but they gotta survive
For the ones who hustle, had to slow up
'Cause they wanna be around and see their kids grow up
My boy got a chain for his 13th birthday
Went to school, niggas jumped him the next day
Truthfully, they took his honesty
'Cause now my nigga locked up for two armed robberies

One step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that
Yeah-yuh
That's how it is sometimes, you know
Shout out to all my niggas with they dreams tho' man
Don't give up
You gotta keep movin' man
All my Detroit niggas, we fucked up
We gon' make it outta this shit man...Embed
