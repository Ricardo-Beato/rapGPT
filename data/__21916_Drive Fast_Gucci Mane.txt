13 ContributorsDrive Fast Lyrics
Yeah, Gucci {*4X*}
Yeah, Gucci {*4X*} (So Icy, So Icy)
Zaytoven baby

I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow
Let ya hair blow, let ya hair blow

I drive a sports car bitch, put them Bapes to the gas
If you scared go to church cause I'm fin' ta drive fast
Throwing cash out the brains of a '74 Oldsmo'
Me and ol' mojo, he need to get some mo' dough
Cornerstore, Amoco, Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Niggas want that work, lil shawty meet right by Gresham Road
East side up, put them E's in the air
If you smoking bubba kush, put them trees in the air
I'm smoking on that kush so it's stankin up my car
They call me "twinkle twinkle" cause they know that I'm a star
I told her come here then I didn't say shit
Cause my ice talk for me, I don't need no broke bitch

I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow
Let ya hair blow, let ya hair blow

Verse two, Gucci fit shoes, and a purse too
Skittle up yo' chain, turn your watch to Starburst too
Put them Lemonheads in yo' ears
Put them Fruity Pebbles on yo' fingers, now you envied by yo' peers
And I'mma get yo' ass in shape
All that Gucci Louis tone got yo' ass losin weight (leanin)
Gucci Mane got you straight, huh?
You know he got that cake, gave it to her first date
I'mma ride down the block like a damn X pill
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels
I'mma roll down the block like a damn X pill
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels

I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow
Let ya hair blow, let ya hair blow


Yeah Rose, red Monkeys wit da Bapes
On some pharaoh shit, bitches feedin a nigga grapes
I'mma buy some hot wings, but I could buy steak
But I'm good with a trap bitch a model too fake
Zaytoven on the beat so you know they gon' hate
Got that Tony Tiger kush, man that shit smoke great
Got that waterboy mentality, I think I can do it
Try me and your body filled with embalming fluid
Trapper slash rapper but a full time G
Smokin purp' with my boys, 'bout two or three P's
I'm a trapper slash rapper but a full time G
Smokin purp' with my boys, 'bout two or three P's
I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow
Let ya hair blow, let ya hair blowEmbed
