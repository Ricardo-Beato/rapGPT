7 ContributorsArmed & Dangerous Lyrics
Ready, set, go, I'm ready to run
Steady we get doe under the sun
About to let go, show me respect though
This will effect your soul and your mental
We came from the bottom and rose to the top
Like the cream in your coffee - burning hot
Climbing the Billboard for the number one spot
King of the block - stop for a second to watch
Look and learn and loose your knot
No more bottles to pop, no birds in the drop
But - we still rollin'! (we still rollin'!) - Pocket's swollen. (pockets swollen!)
We're locked and loaded, then the scene exploded
We solid as ever on any endeavor
Cypress Hill forever, doesn't get any better
We - came and saw, we conquered it all
But we're hungry for more like the kids in Darfur

We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We on God, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just say it with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us

I'm the dog and I'm undisputed and you've been recruited
I'm the general that your boy saluted
Give you a minute to see how we do it
You've never seen such finesse cause you're so polluted
I'm the king in the city of Stone Gate
Knocked 'em out the park when I'm standing at home plate. (c'mon!)
So many years of blood sweat and tears
Without  the dogs steady switchin' the gears
But I'm still the same man from back in the day
And I'm still gettin' luck from Africa to L.A
Jake One hit play; burst started to sway
Every time I leave the city fools want me to stay
'Cause they stay loyal, so it's harder to go
And like the weed under the lights I gots to grow
That means I'll roll (I'll roll!) but I'll return later
Give props to my people, buckshots to haters (buck, buck)

We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We on God, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just say it with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us
We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We on God, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just say it with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us

Raise your hands in the air like you're supposed to
And everybody scream like you're on a rollercoaster
We're down with La Coka Nostra
We smashin', we Sick Jacken and the Soul Assassins
The hip-hop culture - we fuck you vultures
You caught in the rapture, all I hear is laughter
In a year's time some of you punks, won't matter
Let's see if you can hang as you can climb the ladder
You ain't a rapper, you're a fucking joke
A one-shock hack on a track, get your pass revoked
I got keys to the city and we lockin' you out
We come hard for the paint and I'm blockin' you out
So run for the hills and hide when you can
We just put the mic down and be that fan
With your pen in hand outside of the lobby
I'm a pro, get my signature, this ain't no hobby
We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We on God, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just say it with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us
We live hard, still armed and dangerous
We on God, be alarmed, don't play with us
Play the song, gotta bounce just say it with us
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with usEmbed
