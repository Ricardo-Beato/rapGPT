52 ContributorsFighters Lyrics
When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

Or is it something they can never believe?
Or is it something you can never achieve?
Is it beyond your means? Is it inside your dreams?
Can it never come out cause it's scared to, unprepared to
Too worried about the words of the people it's weird to
You don't want them to hear you
You just wish there was a door that would appear
That you can go disappear through
Well I'm feeling your pain
I was feeling the same, but I said I'd never feel that again

When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

Man, I really miss my pops
Hope that God watches over him and that he's on top
That there is no more disease and that he's alright
That he's one of the generals inside the army of the light
And grandma, you know I had to bite something from you
So after every show it's "peace, and much love to you"
Auntie Tweetie's on the way, please look out for that girl
I know we'll meet again, so it's never me against the world

When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?

I hope that God forgive us, all of us sinners
Turn us back into beginners, put us up where the winners go
Holy apartments in the gardens in which the rivers flow
Thank you for all your blessings and all of your miracles
I thank all my fans and all my supporters
Shout out to Bishop G, congrats on your new baby daughter
I tip my hat to all my family and friends
Now we just got one more to go, L-U-P-END
When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are on the ground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?
Is it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?
The world?
