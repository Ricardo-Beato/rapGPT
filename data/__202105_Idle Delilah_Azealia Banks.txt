28 ContributorsIdle Delilah Lyrics
Idlest Delilah
Darling, do ya like beige in your coffee? Tea? A wild-?
Wild breeze on a day, a dawn
Oft' indeed a child, smiles at me cause I'm made of yarn
Dolly, me? Am I? I'll trade a dollar for ya dime, oh
Idlest Delilah
Trout and trees remind me of my
Darling 'D the Diver,'
Diver D was a satyr - a
Father figurine
I made him run away with his stale lung
Folly me am I? Oh, Idol-less Delilah
Darling Miss Delilah
While you're wasting your days alone
All your friends are hired, all your friendships are fading
Don't try to cheat the dial, don't look the other way
It could play out wrong
Are you suicidal?
Are you in denial?
Idlest Delilah
While you're 'wake hear my latest song
Glad to see you smile
Glad to see you so stable
What's all of these divided by the pile of peas on the nape of your..
Dolly me am I? I'll trade a dollar for your dime
I'll take you
