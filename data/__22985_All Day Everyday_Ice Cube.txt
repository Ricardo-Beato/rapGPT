8 ContributorsAll Day Everyday Lyrics
Gangster
Slow that shit down
Yeah
Who wanna ride with this?

We can ride all day everyday
It's do or die all day everyday
It's suicide all day everyday
You'll be high all day everyday

I'm rollin down the avenue, doin what I gotta do
Sick as the swine flu, ain't nuttin fine as you
Must I remind you, what is behind you
Drop it down, to the ground, like you was designed to
You can do it lil' momma, you can do it (you can do it) {*4X*}

We can do it all day everyday
Get into it all day everyday
Drinkin fluid all day everyday
I pursuit it all day everyday, c'mon

You can have it, just reach out and grab it
You can have it, just reach out and grab it
Just be careful don't be a silly rabbit
Recreation use turn into a habit (drop that shit)
You might also likeTo the ground girl take to the ground (drop that shit) {*4X*}

Fuck the feds all day everyday
And chickenheads all day everyday
Get your bread all day everyday
Use your head all day everyday, c'mon
You can do it lil' momma, you can do it (you can do it) {*4X*}

Drop that shit
All day everyday, certified
All day everyday, qualified
All day everyday, West coast warlord
All day everyday, yay yay
The road that I blazed at, nigga from way back
I do's that, I does that, homey what was that {*fades out*}1Embed
