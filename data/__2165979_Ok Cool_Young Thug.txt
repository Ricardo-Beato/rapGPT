8 ContributorsOk Cool Lyrics
Got a thousand ways new dressing island
Me and Skooly  like a thousand islands
Thugger Thugger got cash steady piling
But a young crew steady ready wiling
Dive in, okay bool
Slide in, okay bool
Dive in, okay bool
Okay cool, okay cool

Hickory dickory duck
I'm on my way to the motherfuckin' top, non-stop
I got all these bitches askin' when that album comin' out
I got plasmas in my roof, I'm askin' when they gonna drop
But they ain't, cause I sold a lot of dope to  my plug 
My money turned into water, it'll be a flood this way
I'm sippin' on some lean that's thicker than mud or somethin'
I got so much weed in my blunt, you could cuff a body or somethin'
But this the movement, join in
And every week we swipe up, bowling pens
I love my X double L and Rock friends
Money makin' basketball players, Coach Kidd

Got a thousand ways new dressing island
Me and Skooly  like a thousand islands
Thugger Thugger got cash steady piling
But a young crew steady ready wiling
Dive in, okay bool
Slide in, okay bool
Dive in, okay bool
Okay cool, okay cool
You might also like
Up and on it, still movin' slowly
Pain so big, I got tears up to my shoulders
I'm unloading, fuck it I'm reloadin'
Bout to hop off in your bitch
She gone ride me like I'm stolen, ugh
Not an animal, a monster darlin'
Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan ballin'
I'm hardly ballin'
That nigga better not play with the homies
But on that roster for the rastas homie
Send them rastas on ya
Never will I leave my brothers
Never will I leave my mother
Forever need my mother
I forever feed my brothers
I plant a seed they gonna feed the others
The streets, they love us

Got a thousand ways new dressing island
Me and Skooly  like a thousand islands
Thugger Thugger got cash steady piling
But a young crew steady ready wiling
Dive in, okay bool
Slide in, okay bool
Dive in, okay bool
Okay cool, okay cool3Embed
