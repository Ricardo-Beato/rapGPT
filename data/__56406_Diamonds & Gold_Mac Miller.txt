31 ContributorsDiamonds & Gold Lyrics
Ayy
Turn my beat up a little bit, yeah
For real, I was—, I was—
Oh, it's gonna get louder?
A'ight, cool

She keep on gettin' played like it's recess, break her heart's a reflex
She wanna hit the beach and show her titties down in Key West
Someone leave her cryin' all the time and now she finally outta Kleenex
Sick of dudes not givin' her the respect
'Cause really she a genius, a CEO
Tryin' to be on top alone, she don't keep them close
She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss
Tough bitch, probably would've thought she played lacrosse
Sick of bein' soft with her heart broken all the time
Want some money too, fuckin' dudes
And fallin' all in love with who, was nothin' new
Only comin' through to bust a nut or two
She just need her family like the Huxtables
And now she on the road, left them home to takeover
Get rich and have her crib made over
But she gon' do it partyin', with her cup full
Ain't gon' trust you, but she gon' fuck you, haha
You might also like
She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
'Cause she's been high and she been low
But now she finally on her own
And they’ve been lookin', so they been findin'
'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
Until she find her way back home
And then she's finally all alone

She gon' be rich, as fuck
In high school, they were callin' her a slut
But now she comin' up, Louis Vuitton, and Juicy on her butt
See the bitches that be hatin' like, "What’s up?"
'Cause they ain't doin' nothin', and she out here stuntin'
Middle finger to them hoes, all them bitches had it comin', haha
Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down
Invite you to the crib, let you look around
Just a fuckin' tease, tryna get your cheese
Invite you out to dinner, 'cause she wanna eat for free
She could pay it if she wanted to, she won't though
Go home, she got more dough, haha

She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
'Cause she's been high and she been low
But now she finally on her own
And they've been lookin', so they been findin'
'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
Until she find her way back home
And then she's finally all alone

She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
'Cause she's been high and she been low
But now she finally on her own
And they've been lookin', so they been findin'
'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
Until she find her way back home
And then she's finally all alone6Embed
