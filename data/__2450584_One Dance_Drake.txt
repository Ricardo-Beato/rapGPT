47 ContributorsOn My Way Lyrics
The clock that you've been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands will say
They'll say

Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start, no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Oh, oh, think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh, baby, I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need's an address and I'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes, I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Because I'm on my way

Won't hurt, it's just some turbulence we're dropping
Don't be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
I'll keep you safe, so safe
You might also like
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start, no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Oh, oh, think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh, baby, I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need's an address and I'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes, I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Because I'm on my way

Ah-ooh, I'm on my way
Ah-ooh, I'm on my way
Ah-ooh, I'm on my way
Ah-ooh, I'm on my way19Embed
