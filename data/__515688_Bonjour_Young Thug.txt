18 ContributorsBonjour Lyrics
Um...
Thugga Thugga, baby
Say what up?
Free bars

I'm having sex with molly (Hey, what?)
Fuck a bodyguard (Ha)
Duey Kartel gon' guard my body
Cause I'm iced out (Ayy)
But this ho right here she's a real hottie (She hot)
Make me fuck around and climb on the top rope like Scotty 2 Hotty (That move)
Powerbomb, baby (Huh)
No, actually these are powerbombs, baby (Uh-huh)
And I hope they make it so I can go and get me some baby (Hey, what?)
That shit tie you up baby (Haha)
Uh, my blunt stay like real  baby
Try to rob, put some sight upon his head (What's that?)
That's a power bomb baby! (Haha)
Ball everyday no set back (Hey, what?)
I tell her: whip this here (Hey, what?), then go get that babe (Go get that)
And these niggas, they ain't hard (They what?), they like wet crack baby (Catch up, nigga)
Treat his body like two bricks (Just what?), just split that babe (Haha)
On the old watch for new reason (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Got a wear coat with my jewels like it's flu season (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Just bought my son a blue coat (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Like he was Four Seasons for no reason
But my whole crew is obese
And grab me and just gave me sixteen bars on the track but I know he teasin' (Let's go)
But I'm Thug!

Look out the corner of my eye (Hey), I'm thinking again (Hey, what you think?)
Bonjour, 'ey, Bonjour, my friend (Okay, cool)
