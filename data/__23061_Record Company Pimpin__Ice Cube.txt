Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
A nigga told me, the record company's the pimp
The artist is the ho, The stage is the corner
And the audience is the trick, god damn

Incredible young nigga, you can't believe I'm just one nigga
God damn i've gotten bigger
Intellect superior
Walk in a room and make the whole interior, inferior
If you look me in my eyes
You might fuck around and lose control
Of your mind body and your soul, grab ahold
Undisputed on the microphone, whatchu think
If you wink, i'll make you ich think
Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter
Shotgun enema, this ain't no cinema
All praises due to the creator
--for this man here, that can't no nigga stand near--
True, inventor of the W
Whatchu wanna do, i got the red and the blue
Show me one nigga dedicated to raps
I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps
Record company death traps settin' decoys
Just to pimp young b-boys
With a cup full of yak, studio contact
Maniac with a contract
Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble
About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level
Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in
And take all my publishin', god damn
Do i take it up the rectum
Just to rock the spectrum
Give up a right arm, just to do the form
Hell no, all you motherfukers goan leave this bitch limpin'
No more, record company pimpin'

No more (No more), record company pimpin'
No more (No more), record company pimpin'
No more (No more), record company pimpin'

You ain't pimpin' me (uhn uhh, uhn uhh)
I ain't pimpin' you (uhn uhh, uhn uhh)
I just wanna be free (i just wanna be free)
So what we gonna do (can i holla at you, holla at you)
You ain't pimpin' me (please listen to my demo)
I ain't pimpin' you (please listen to my demo)
I just wanna be free (i just wanna be free)
So what we gonna do (can i holla at you, holla at you)

I'mma keep it simple, it went from "please listen to my demo"
To "get your ass out my limo"
Stretch presidential
It's essential cuz the record company will have your ass in a rental
If you let 'em, You have to behead 'em
Contracts you never read 'em
CEO's you never met 'em
Sent to a attorney, Burnstein and Burney
Nigga that's his lawyer, ain't got nothin' for ya
Treat ya like they employ ya, I'm a warrior
Bite you in the ass like a Georgetown Hoya
When they ignore ya cause, you got to hold your balls
Catch a motherfucker slippin' in bathroom stalls
And then you show 'em that you ain't a rookie
Let 'em know that you'd rather have, more points than more pussy
Pimp turned bookie
Now how the fuck i get in so much debt
God damn, we just met
He said, "Welcome to the rap game"
Motherfucker be confused and broke before he know whats happenin'
You can be the star and fuck women
I'mma just play the back and keep pimpin'
No more (No more), record company pimpin'
No more (No more), record company pimpin'
No more (No more), record company pimpin'
No more No more No more No more
You ain't pimpin' me (uhn uhh, uhn uhh)
I ain't pimpin' you (uhn uhh, uhn uhh)
I just wanna be free (i just wanna be free)
So what we gonna do (can i holla at you, holla at you)
You ain't pimpin' me (please listen to my demo)
I ain't pimpin' you (please listen to my demo)
I just wanna be free (i just wanna be free)
So what we gonna do (can i holla at you, holla at you)

It went from please listen to my demo
To get your ass out my limo
It went from please listen to my demo
To get your ass out my limo
It went from please listen to my demo
To get your ass out my limo
It went from please listen to my demo
To get your ass out my limo

Mama's, don't let your kids grow up to be rappers
Unless you tell them if they gonna get in this business
They better learn this business
Or they gon' get fucked
Simple as that
Simple as thatEmbed
