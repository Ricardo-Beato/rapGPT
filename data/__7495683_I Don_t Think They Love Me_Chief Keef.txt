20 ContributorsI Don’t Think They Love Me Lyrics
Ye put Chicago on, I put Chiraq on
Ye put Chicago on, I put Chiraq on
On foenem
Nah, for real
Thank you, thank you, thank you

We done buried so many of the guys
Got a AP but don't know when it’s your time
She like “Sosa, do you like fish?”, un-un
If she from Hong-Kong, she be eatin' wonton
Chopsticks, sizzle cake 'cause it’s bum-bum-bum
Gun on you, but it's in trunk, what the fuck?
I pulled Jovel out the seat and pump him up
You in close range, that shotgun gon' dump you up
In Audi bitches juggin' on me
Party bitches, juggin' on me (Yeah)
Pop him and his homie
Fry they ass, like baloney
I can buy a chimp, still lonely
Ever since I got money
I don't think bitches love me
Ridin' 'round in my Hellcat
He hate me, I felt that
With the coochie, she be actin’ stand jack (Gang)
Turn the T, I nailed that (Ayy)
You ain’t grow up in the projects (Gang)
I made it bitch, that's some stretch (Gang)
We love you more and one less (Gang)
I don’t want you, baby, I want neck
I ain't buyin' a bitch shit if she don't buy me shit
Weed, water and cock for a freak bitch
I can’t give a bitch shit if she ain't gave me shit
She don't know who her baby daddy, say I might be him
Say a nigga actin' crazy, that's how we get
You ain't get tutored in the streets, how you gon' teach shit?
I can't live with no bitch, she might leak my shit (Bang, bang)
I just hit the back of the club on some VIP shit
You might also like
Ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Sos' baby (Bang, bang)
Sit' gang, situation gang, bitch (Bang, bang)

I wanna clear my mind (Ayy, ayy)
I got a Lamborghini and it's parked outside (Ayy, ayy)
I'm in a Lamborghini (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Couldn't make it right with shorty, at least I tried
Wanna be my shorty, I am not Plies (Ayy, ayy)
Tryna have me sprung, I ain't T-Pain (Ayy, ayy)
Got some bad hoes, brought them to meet gang (Ayy, ayy)
I mean, gang got bad hoes, and they brought ‘em to me, me (Ayy, ayy)
Sent some flyers up, let you know, choppa got a meet and greet (Ayy, ayy)
Fuck G on the west side of the fefe (Ayy, ayy)
You know I'm Gucci, yeah, I'm GG (Bang, bang)
Skinny lil' bitch with a head like RiRi (Bang, bang)2Embed
