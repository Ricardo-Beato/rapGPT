Hear Me, See Me
Welcome to Soundview Projects
Bronx New York, 10473

Intersection action ribs touching
New gutter smacks replacing the whole Dutchman
Loose mamis fucking, they're definite land mines
Dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs
Empty in the webbings broke and underpaid
Fighting federal cases with legal aids
The unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat
Can get you in a 8 by 5, the corner's younger
I smell, feel, touch and taste their hunger
Next in line to rep these street signs to their blunder
Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony
These niggas wanna be Pistol Pete - without the penalty
His last words, promise me this much in death:
"Don't let my boy grow up to retrace my steps"
Minne- stay safe move quiet and get it
If you encounter opposition get a inch from their face with It
Later amigo, digest the data end discreetly
Sex money and boss my ties to hear me see me
True villain, face covered, driving gloves
Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove
They say that grown men lay on they prey, took shorts in the street
Came back and made up for that with that white sheet
Revenge is best served cold, get it the same way you give it
This ain't fear I just need to get away with it
So don't stop over here, you're looking at me like I'm lame
But I'm looking at y'all like "You call this the drug game?"
Grandchild hosing sims, put the heroin in queens
Put Pops Freeman on in the early seventies
I sat in rooms with money machines
Drugs sitting three feet off of the floor, cover the smell of the raw
Chess moves like Barksdale, my connects untimely
King Henry from 12th street flooded the Bronx in the 90's
03 scene MVP and one Accord
Boss makes decision paper wins awards

See Me, Hear Me
Welcome to Brooklyn, New York City 11206
Roosevelt Projects, wild rose water the plant

Son you know what it is
From the moment that you come over the bridge
And if you don't ride with me I'ma show you some shit
I'mma show you how my niggas stay sure in the mix
I'mma show you where the pain in the poetry is
Ghetto young'ns spend a lot of time alone in the crib
BET on the screen, walls and posters of BIG
Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6
Blazing up the ambro', with glow over their wrist
Hop in the game knowing the risk, still down to load up their clip
Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip
But when you hear a head crack there ain't no rolling again
Snatch the dice and everything you want is going to them
That's how it happens
Good people, bad habits
Diabetics, crack addicts, asthmatics
Searching for the truth, leaping through the holy tablet
The Bible, the Quran, or the ten crack commandments
Speak on it God: "What's today's mathematics?
The five day forecast? The Dow Jones average?
The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers?"
Life is a test and we've all got to answer
The streets keep calling. It's hard not answer
And on my government-my attribute-my all
So it's only natural I holla black and respond
Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down
Cock hard with no coat we do not fuck around
That's what it is (All Day)
That's what is niggas (Official, Official)
That's how it is niggas (M-Don, M-Definite)
BX, BK live all day
Get with it
