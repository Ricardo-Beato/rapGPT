16 ContributorsDem Lyrics
If you ain't fuckin' with my campaign ain't no love for you
I went from sellin' cocaine to my auntie and dem
Dem same niggas I grew up with I be clubbing with dem
We whipping Maseratis back-to-back we lovin' this shit
Dem cold cold niggas yeah I thug with dem
I drink my lean I roll my bud I do my dirt wit' dem
You got my back I gotcho' back I'm breakin' bread wit' dem
I got your girl askin' your FreeBand niggas wasup wit' dem

Dem goonie goon niggas them my partners
Serve crack, buy a old-school Impala
Dem same niggas I used to be in the trap-house wit'
Dem same niggas that you see me with will take yo' shit
No mask on sight it's not a job
That's every day life for niggas around my way
Oh you lookin' for a sponsor, I can sponsor you
You keep fuckin' round and you gon' get a monster coupe
I'm talking Space Jam ballin' 'ont play no games with you
You know them FreeBand gang niggas sell bales with you
And it ain't nothin' to get brand new
Sippin' Tropicana, holdin' onto banana clips

If you ain't fuckin' with my campaign ain't no love for you
I went from sellin' cocaine to my auntie and dem
Dem same niggas I grew up with I be clubbing with dem
We whipping Maseratis back-to-back we lovin' this shit
Dem cold cold niggas yeah I thug with dem
I drink my lean I roll my bud I do my dirt wit' dem
You got my back I gotcho' back I'm breakin' bread wit' dem
I got your girl askin' your FreeBand niggas wasup wit' dem

Lit up a blunt, the blunt right here for niggas dead and gone
Rolled up a  for niggas with life, ain't comin' home
That interstate, that interstate, takin' that ride
I swear the day we played hearts plays back in my mind
A few Hublots and a bad ho, with Styrofoam, I'm leanin'
If I ever told you I love you, dog, if I said it, nigga I mean it
I'm 'bout to wreck the bank, no robber, put the vault in my house
We kick that big shit with them bitches then we kickin' 'em out
You see a nigga turn on you when you ain't in the circle
And I knew that shit would hurt you when you see I was leavin'
It really fuck your hope, cause my niggas, they need me
If you ain't loyal to the game then you know I don't need you

If you ain't fuckin' with my campaign ain't no love for you
I went from sellin' cocaine to my auntie and dem
Dem same niggas I grew up with I be clubbing with dem
We whipping Maseratis back-to-back we lovin' this shit
Dem cold cold niggas yeah I thug with dem
I drink my lean I roll my bud I do my dirt wit' dem
You got my back I gotcho' back I'm breakin' bread wit' dem
I got your girl askin' your FreeBand niggas wasup wit' dem4Embed
