15 ContributorsTrying to Fly Lyrics
And I don't even know why
I can't hold on to a word that you say
You escaped from your cage
Just to dance and play across a random face, like
Fly away, little horse, fly
'For it finds you on the front page
We're familiar with the frustration
To say we stay sedated, it's an understatement
Look alive, life is a celebration
We would like to use your current location
Lost faith after the first rotation
And gave it back to the dirt like it wasn't worth saving
And oh, Lord, if I wasn't so bored
I'd already poured this bottle on the floor
Yeah, right, we ain't spilling a drop
About to get so high that we feel like Gods
And I don't even know why

Time ain't cheap, but I know why
'Cause what I need, I can't buy
You're trying to sleep, I'm trying to fly
But life goes on, and so do I
I'm trying to fly
You might also like
And I don't even know why
I still feel like a rat in a maze
Even though I know nowadays
I should probably have found a method to count my ways
I'm tryna leave the runway
Confident, I need to go surround myself with sunrays
Life's too short to keep shoveling flakes
I walk into the water till I'm covered in waves
From the first breath till the next laugh
Better have a plan to catch your best half
Never let the lakes break beneath the heavyweight
Gotta spray a little paint on this designated negative space
And I don't even know why
But I'm committed to leaving you with the valid and vivid impression
We could separate the pain from the message
But state of mind still in the state of corrections
And I don't even know why

Time ain't cheap, but I know why
'Cause what I need, I can't buy
You're trying to sleep, I'm trying to fly
But life goes on and so do IEmbed
