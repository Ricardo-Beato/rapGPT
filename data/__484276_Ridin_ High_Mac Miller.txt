12 ContributorsRidin’ High Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune (High)
To the sounds of The High Life

Roll a Swisher up, put the windows up
I'm in the whip, I'm ridin' high (I am Mac Miller)
Roll a Swisher up, put the windows up
Chillin' with yo' bitch, I'm ridin' high
(So for y'all who don't know, you about to find out real quick)
Roll a Swisher up, put the windows up
Gon' hit that spliff, I'm ridin' high
(If you smokin' a L, better roll ya muhfuckin' windows up, bitch, it's The High Life)

Gotta bunch of piff, don't touch, don't sniff
Y'all gon' hit it when the blunt get lit
Speakers so loud that they bust through bricks
I'ma kidnap Pelé, trunk gon' kick
It's The High Life, come and get ya mind right
I'm in the spotlight, blind 'cause it shine bright
Let me get a Dutchie and a honey wanna love me
Never bummy, gettin' money, well, that's just my night (Haha)
And when the lights go out, nobody gon' know yo' name (Uh-uh)
Fans screamin', they believe him when they meet him
It's so easy and they see that when he blow to fame
See, the kid know the game (Uh-huh)
And I'm a little bit swole at change
But forget that, kick back, hit that piff sack (Oh)
Light up, show your flame (Oh, oh; high)

Roll a Swisher up, put the windows up
I'm in the whip, I'm ridin' high
Roll a Swisher up, put the windows up
Chillin' with yo' bitch, I'm ridin' high (I'm ridin' high)
Roll a Swisher up, put the windows up
Gon' hit that spliff, I'm ridin' high

Jerm, you crazy for this one
Get into itEmbed
