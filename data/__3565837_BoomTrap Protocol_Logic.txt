88 ContributorsBoomTrap Protocol Lyrics
Let me get up in this bitch, like, "What's good, ho?"
Grippin' this grain, I spit to release the pain
Pimpin' ain't a thang, what's good?
Hold up, let me get it right, I been contemplating life
I been grindin' on a fight, I been writin' on a flight
Roll up on 'em like that Backwood
Better act good or get smacked good
I'm just tryna live life, I'm just tryna get right
Anybody got advice?
I know I'm a workaholic but everybody got a vice
I leave 'em diminished
And I do not know if you know
That I am so ahead of my time
That my whole motherfuckin' discography's already finished
The greatest alive, bitch, I been it
Now go on your business, can I get a witness?
Been smoking and drinking a little bit
There's levels to the litness

Pull up with that new-new in the driveway
So fresh, I double park that bitch sideways
When it comes to life, I do it my way
Smoked out 180 on the highway
Yeah, I'm sittin' shotgun
Gotta let my shawty drive
I'm too alive, leave that pussy crucified
It's just you and I
You know it's do-or-die
It's just you and I
Girl, you know it's do-or-die
(Made this shit right here for any season)
Do-or-die
(Everybody know that it's the reason)
It's do-or-die
(Made this shit right here for any season)
It's do-or-die
(Everybody know that it's the reason)
Yeah, this shit right here do-or-die
(Made this shit right here for any season)
(Everybody know that it's the reason)
It's do-or-die
(Made this shit right here for any season)
(Everybody know that it's the reason)

Hold up, wait a minute, bring it right back
Mix that real with that turn up, call it BoomTrap
I ain't heard no shit like this in so long
I don't know how this right here could go wrong
This is my theme song, me and my team's song
I got millions in the bank because my dream's strong
I don't sip the syrup, I got friends to lean on
But I get my green on, yes, I get my green on
Pull up in this bitch and smoke a O
Like woah, goddamn
Yeah, that boy, he been on the low
About to blow, about to show
About to show 'em, I don't know 'em
I don't know 'em, no, I don't know 'em
I don't know, I don't
I vibe wit' 'em, I ride wit' 'em
If they down wit' me, you know I die wit' 'em
