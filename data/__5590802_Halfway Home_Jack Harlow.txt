Okay these people think they know me and they might
Imma be honest but that's only for tonight
If you step up to me homie then you know we 'bout to fight
And she want a real man I could show her what that's like
Not really, I'm kind of a pussy
Every fella in the building wants a bite of the cookie
And to be honest I'm overwhelmed
You prolly don't know me well
I'm frontin' like I'm somethin' but it's honestly show and tell
I'm tryna trade my v-card in for a driver's license
They said that I should wait until I find the right chick
So I guess I'll get a girl that I could ride my bike with
And when we grow old she can ride on my nine-inch
Set of rims that I'm gonna buy for my car
Gotta get 'em chromed out 'til they shine with the stars
I tell the truth, I ain't never lied with these bars
On a lazy Sunday man I'm tryna re-charge

They don't ever know what to expect, ha
Ima have to show 'em I'm the best, ha
Never knew that I was doper than the rest, ha
Got your girl touchin' on my shoulders and my chest, ha

Halfway home and I'm feelin' like a winner
Still the young boy but I ain't no beginner
We can get it poppin' if you really want to
You deserve a round so baby come through
You might also like
People think they know me and they might
Ima be honest but that's only for tonight
If you step up to me homie then you know we 'bout to fight
And she want a real man I could show you what that's like, uh
One's in my pocket and some change in the fanny pack
Flows so stupid I be parkin' in the handicap
Parking spot night or day, dark or not hard to stop
 I just hit the mic, lay it down and mark the spot
I  in the studio
Chillin' with the boys while we steady playin' Yu-Gi-Oh
Girls want my heart 'cause they know the kid is truly dope
Ion play with love though, I ain't Ricky Rubio
But the other side of me thinks maybe I'm just scared
I want a girlfriend that understands and likes playing with my hair
I want a girlfriend that comprehends that everything ain't always fair
And doesn't passive-aggressively have to say that she don't care

They don't ever know what to expect, ha
Ima have to show 'em I'm the best, ha
Never knew that I was doper than the rest, ha
Got your girl touchin' on my shoulders and my chest, ha

Halfway home and I'm feelin' like a winner
Still the young boy but I ain't no beginner
We can get it poppin' if you really want to
You deserve a round so baby come through
Ok these people think they know me and they might
Ima be honest but that's only for tonight
If you step up to me homie then you know we 'bout to fight
And she want a real man I could show you what that's like, uh
'Cause I'm extroverted, introverted
Drop a beat I'm finna murk it
Write the bars and spit the verses
All you rappers been deserted
Skippin' dinner, get dessert, I hit the track and get to work
Analyze the situation tryna pick out which is worse
Watchin all these women twerkin', vicious when they get it workin'
Swear to God it's picture-perfect even if it isn't worth it
And I'm writin' 'til the pen is burnin'
Still doin' me just a different version
I'm 'bout to get it go ahead and tell 'em fall back
I got the raw tracks homie you ain't all that
We can get it poppin' if you really want to
You deserve a round so baby come through

They don't ever know what to expect, ha
Ima have to show 'em I'm the best, ha
Never knew that I was doper than the rest, ha
Got your girl touchin' on my shoulders and my chest, ha (x2)
Halfway home and I'm feelin' like a winner
Still the young boy but I ain't no beginner
We can get it poppin' if you really want to
You deserve a round so baby come through (x2)Embed
