6 ContributorsWRMS: Catâ€™s in Control LyricsIf it's not De La Slow, then it's not WRMS. Where Cat's in control
Twisting and tuning until you're purr-fectly content. Special cat
Call goes out to the suckers at the donut shop. Thanks for serving it
To me dark, hot, and no caffeine. Snuggle tight and hang loose
Boys, it's time to groove to a De La Slow move on WRMSYou might also likeEmbed
