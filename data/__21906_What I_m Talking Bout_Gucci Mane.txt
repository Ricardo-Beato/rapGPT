4 ContributorsWhat Iâ€™m Talking Bout Lyrics
(Headbangers) Yeahhh! {*2X*}
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
Yeahhhh~!

Gucci Mane, Laflare, there's money in the air
It's ballin over here, it's models over there
It's party over there, we ballin over here
It's Gucci Mane, Laflare, this song is out of here
That's what I'm talkin 'bout, I'm gettin guapped out
And I don't swap it out, you better walk it out
Cause if I pull it out, there's nuttin to talk about
That's what I'm talkin 'bout, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Pedal to the floor, that's what the Porsche about
Chickens in the kitchen, that's what I'm talkin 'bout
And I'll chalk you out, and I'll cross you out
And I'll move you out, that's what I'm talkin 'bout

Twenty-eight inch rims that's what we talkin 'bout
Million just on our jewels, that's what we talkin 'bout
Birthday cake for the crew, that's what we talkin 'bout
You either cash it in, or we'll cash you out

Girl we'll get you drunk, and then we'll dog you out
Kick you to the curb, that's what the boss about
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? On some twenty-eights
That's what I'm talkin 'bout, it's sittin so high
I don't see the traffic, but I can see the sky
I just get the cake, but I don't see the pie
Walk through the club, we don't see the lines
They don't pat us down, so they don't see the nines
Where I party at, you know I'm keepin mine
You know I'm sneakin mine, gotta keep in mind
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
What'cha talkin 'bout - So Icy bank account
You might also like

Signed with Atlantic, now I'm makin mills
Bitch I might be, gone off of pills
Paint match the wheels, the chain match the grill
Major record deal, hundred dollar bills
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? You don't know about
Pull up to the bank, and snatch a hundred out
Then smash out, to my shawty house
Let's go shoppin shawty, that's what I'm talkin 'bout


Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh~!
