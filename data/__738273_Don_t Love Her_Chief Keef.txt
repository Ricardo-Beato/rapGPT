13 ContributorsDonâ€™t Love Her Lyrics
GGP
Ayy, ayy, ayy

Bad bitch, ayy, want my number, ayy
I'ma fuck her, ayy, if I wanna, ayy
I don't wanna, I don't love her
I love the way she suck me up, but I don't trust her
I don't love her, I don't love her
I don't love her, I don't love her
I don't love her, I don't love her
I don't love her, I don't love her

I smoke loud, smoke that thunder
You smoke that uh-uh, I don't want none
She's a runner, I don't want her
Boy, you love her, you put your trust in her
I be flexin', she be textin'
She wanna pull up, ayy, so we could be sexin'
I ain't with it, she can forget it, ayy
She can give me top, I only got a minute
I'm a eagle, ayy, nigga, fuck your pigeons, ayy
I'm like Weezy, nigga, fuck your feelings, ayy
She call my phone, ring ring, I'm like, "What is it?"
She like, "I'm in town and I wanna give you a visit"

I'ma fuck her, ayy, if I wanna, ayy
I don't wanna, I don't love her
I love the way she suck me up, but I don't trust her
I don't love her, I don't love her
I don't love her, I don't love her
I don't love her, I don't love her
I don't love her, I don't love her4Embed
