I swear, I seen you at the mall today
I tried to call your name, but you were far away
And when I look into your eyes, I see just stars and space
In the future, please don't Medusa, if you start to snake
Which is why me and my ex, we had to part our ways
She left me for this dude, Tim, I learned a harder way
I was a sucker for love
There would be nothing above
These girls, but I was dumb and that was nothing but lust
But girl, I can tell we headed in the right direction
You got a really nice complexion and you like attention
What explains, you're like extensions
And we can head into the night, ascension
And did I mention
That whenever you smile at me, you take me to a galaxy
Way past the Earth, you made me laugh at first
Which is far different from any other girl, you're so authentic
And in this love game, I'm hard in it, my heart spinning
Not to mention, your elegance and intelligence
Musta been practicing, more blessed than a reverend
And I can tell again
That there was someone else, makes me a jealous man
Heart feeling like gelatin
And no matter for a simile
Can't express the envy that I get, when you not that really into me
Although mentally
It kills me when you say that we really wasn't meant to be
It's like she just want to be friends with me
I swear that kills my drive, yeah, my last gear
Cuz I've been wanting and watching you for the past year
Or at least a few months
I hope you keeping in touch
Because it's a little deeper than lust
And it's a reason to blush
Cuz it's the season to cuff
See I noticed you, liking
Mind showing, Tyson
Plus she light skin
And that's just facts
I gave her my number and she never text me back
Now that's realYou might also like1Embed
