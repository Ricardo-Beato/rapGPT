If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin'—

I ain't never quittin' on my homies from the set
Rather die a legend than be livin' with regrets
Granny up in Heaven, know she watch a nigga back
G Class, flyin' down' Orizaba Ave
I know that you love me but you gotta give me space
Money hungry women do whatever for a taste
All my people in the hood, what it's finna take
To have everybody livin' good? I don't wanna wait
In a minute, I'ma bust a juug, I'ma make a play
Hit the homie up and hit a lick, run in where you stay
All the pressure I be dealin' with, still ain't ever change
I'm about the money, I ain't fuckin' with the fame

DJ Quik (Get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid)
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
(Get paid, young nigga, get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid)
DJ Quik (Get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid)
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
(Get paid, young nigga, get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid, get paid)

You should see the limit on my Amex
One phone call and it's niggas at your address
I'm gon' ball 'til I'm sittin' in the grave
Fuck all y'all, bet Ramona get the last laugh
Close your mouth when you talkin' to a killer, bitch
They say I murder cuh, I say, "I'm innocent"
This ain't suburbia, these niggas ignorant
I always get my man, I only miss my bitch
Yeah, hit me up if you wish
I'm in the studio, couple guns, couple Crips
Tryna make a hunnid Ms, what's a couple bands?
Keep it comin' in, keep it comin' in

DJ Quik (Yeah, get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid)
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
(Get paid, young nigga, get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid)
DJ Quik (Get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid)
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make sense
(Get paid, young nigga, get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid, get paid)

(Get paid, yeah, get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid, get paid, young nigga, get paid)
Nigga that you know that's been down for years
I've clowned for years, and y'all could never fade my peers
One, two, three, four, five—3Embed
