Looking back then you’ll be like... ayy
(Oh lawd) Look at me now
(Oh lawd, oh lawd)
Looking back then you’ll be like (Oh lawd) fff, ayy

Looking back then, you’ll be like oh lawd
Look at me now, you’ll be like oh lawd
Looking back then, you’ll be like oh lawd
Look at me now, you’ll be like oh lawd
That bitch seen my chain and she was like oh lawd, oh lawd
I gave her that thang and she was like oh lawd
Niggas seen my earrings and they was like oh boy, oh boy
But he know never try to rob Almighty So, boy

Come through killin' shit, droppin' shit
Or I do a hit list bitch on my Dodgers shit
Niggas steady talking about poppin' out
We gon' start poppin' shit
Nigga gon' be on that roster again
Like fuck the Feds
They mad cause a young nigga made it and got ahead
They wanna lock me up and throw away the key, that's not fair
I made it up outta there
Now I'm ridin' round totin' choppas
Ridin' round shootin' blocks up
Everybody mad cause I'm gettin' that gwap up
Like that's gon' make me stop it
Nuh-uh, no
Give it to me, money, choppa waterfall
Don't give a fuck 'bout no cops but I am one of y'all
We some Energizer bunnies y'all
Even though I believe in God, uh
I'm still goin' out with my Glock up
I spent 40 thou' on Balenciaga's
Baby, I don't like no Prada
You might also like
Looking back then, you’ll be like oh lawd
Look at me now, you’ll be like oh lawd
Looking back then, you’ll be like oh lawd
Look at me now, you’ll be like oh lawd
That bitch seen my chain and she was like oh lawd, oh lawd
I gave her that thang and she was like oh lawd
Niggas seen my earrings and they was like oh boy, oh boy
But he know never try to rob Almighty So, boy

I took her to the crib, she like "oh lawd"
She never seen a mansion with glass floors
I’m stuck up in my glory, I know
I got some top and kicked her out the door
I put her in the whip, she like "oh lawd"
She said she done fuckin' with lil boys
They ain't got no guap, ain't makin' no noise
She hit my dope, it knocked her out like Floyd, oh lawd
For these shoes I paid 'bout four, oh lawd
I bought a pint and po'd a fourth, oh lawd
Pockets fat like ass on Couture, oh lawd
200 on the dash in my car, oh lawd

My pockets fat like the ass of Kim K, oh lawd
How I'm runnin' through this cake, oh lawd
What car I'ma drive today? Oh lawd
Remember when I ain't have nothin' before
Now I can have it all
Problem is that I'm gon' ball till I fall
Don't care bout none of y'all
Looking back then, you’ll be like oh lawd
Look at me now, you’ll be like oh lawd
Looking back then, you’ll be like oh lawd
Look at me now, you’ll be like oh lawd
That bitch seen my chain and she was like oh lawd, oh lawd
I gave her that thang and she was like oh lawd
Niggas seen my earrings and they was like oh boy, oh boy
But he know never try to rob Almighty So, boy7Embed
