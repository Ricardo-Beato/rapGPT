14 ContributorsGym Lyrics
Gucci got it going on, bout to roll one a mile long
Walking through Hell with gasoline drawers on
Niggas saying the 'wop falling off, they got me all wrong
Bullshit on top of bullshit, it get piled on
I'm a OG, you better get your child, take your child home
You'll be long gone, all gone, no one to call on
Big diamonds on my bezel, damn near bigger than rhinestones
GuWop, 1017, 'nother milestone!
(Hello, hello, hello, I'm painting everything red, no more yellow
I'm pulling double headers, wish I never met her
Rihanna, Umbrella, Gucci, , I'm like "fuck a Cinderella")
Puchanella, Puchanella wearing cashmere sweater
This year I'm doing better so my paint mo' wetter
And she can't trick you less you let her, my Jordans patent leather
I want your bitch, I go get her, smashed her, now can't get rid her

Puchanella, Puchanella, give me that pussy, don't let up
I chase that paper, don't let up (x2)
Kiss that little girl one time, then I'll never let her let up
Kiss that little baby one fucking time, then I'll never let up

100k spent on my rings, 100k spent on my jeans
100k spent on my..., 100k, throwed on her spleen
100k, fucked all her team, 100k spent on her...
100k spray through my team, we chase paper, Charlie Sheen

I guess them bezzie, my wife, done slaughtered them
I'm not Casino but I just be killing it, killing it, killing it
The bitch say she wanna fuck on Young Thug because he the real-i-est
Ah! Bitch, I'm attending the party, these niggas are jeal-i-ous
I done po'd a eight inside a fo', I'm po'd (slow up)
I done spent my last thousand with mojo
I'm so easy to rob, I'm always at the store
I could treat her like cray cause I keep big ol' bowls
Ah, she got that "come back", she got that "hum-tam"
She got that Bill Clinton, she got that YSL
She got that "skrr-skrr", she got that "ooh-wee"
She got that bomb, lady, she say I'm ugly

Puchanella, Puchanella, give me that pussy, don't let up
I chase that paper, don't let up (x2)
Kiss that little girl one time, then I'll never let her let up
Kiss that little baby one fucking time, then I'll never let up

100k spent on my rings, 100k spent on my jeans
100k spent on my..., 100k, throwed on her spleen
100k, fucked all her team, 100k spent on her...
100k spray through my team, we chase paper, Charlie SheenEmbed
