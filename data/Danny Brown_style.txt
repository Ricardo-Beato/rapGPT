Another day, another dollar I make
Risk I take for the chrome 28's
Momma said son, keep your head up
But it's hard in the D, I gotta get my bread up
So I ride '94 with nowhere to go
Bag came in, cause I moved the bows
The son of a player no love for hoes
And the year ain't new, but it don't look old
Should hit Northland see what they got new
But I'd rather hit the store go fuck with the crew
Ride around the hood, blow blunt after blunt
Seem like a good day I ain't seen a hook once
So I'm riding in the wood 'bout to pick my man up
Hit a couple corners, probably roll some gan up
My man's got his heater 'cuz the streets is cold
But I told him put it up because my L's is bold

Let's go, c'mon, roll with a nigga
Where we going? I don't know my nigga
Let's blow, hey yo you got another swisher?
Light the gan up, c'mon roll with a nigga
Let's go c'mon, roll with a nigga
Where we going? I don't know my nigga
Let's blow, hey yo you got another swisher?
Light the gan up, c'mon roll with a nigga

Just another day in the streets of the D

And the work might cost, but to murder is free
Pray and holler at my man 'cuz he owe me a few
Gan in the air, with a Bud Ice brew
Narco's ride, so I took my sack
And before hop on the lines 'cuz I know its packed
Break bows, so I ride slow, slow
Hit the Coney's cause my gas low, low
Cop a bag, roll a blunt and say to extras
And I swoop a couple hoes then ride up Dexter
Blow my trees, no stress at all
Gan in mine, but it's stress in y'all
Hit the crib get dressed as soon as the sun fall
Right now, I'm just rhyming, timing my phone calls

Let's go, c'mon, roll with a nigga
Where we going? I don't know my nigga
Let's blow, hey yo you got another swisher?

Ain't no more food stamps, man they been stopped that
Give it to you on the card, if you follow these steps
And my girl got one, mean we gon' eat good
A week out the month, mean we gon' be full
And it's so hard, we depend on that
But who cares if generic brands in the cabinet?
So I'mma hit the hood, and see what's up though
Maybe try to cop some gan, hopefully I serve some custos
But if it don't work, I ain't gon' trip
Cause when my girl get off of work, we got to hit the market
And I got to help her with the boxes out the car
Yeah, boxes, boxes out the car
And it might sound hard but the steaks so soft
And I love the way she cook, hook the rice up with the broth
Yeah, pour another glass of pop y'all
And thank God for a Bridge Card

Let's bow our heads, hold hands, and thank God
Let's hit the market my baby and go hard
Let's hit Save a Lot and we can buy it all
Thank God for a Bridge Card, hey!

They say the hood starving, but we be eating
Frying wing dings with the fake Lawry seasoning

Just one swipe, we barbecuing in the hood, bro
Eating cheese doodles, don't let the size fool you
Tonight we eating shrimp, take a break from the noodles
Yeah, and you know we out of place
When welfare the only thing that put a smile on her face
So baby cook some breakfast, I need my energy
I hit the block fresh, time to serve these fiends
Just tryna catch sales, you know how I do
And she got the WIC Card, so that's mad Juicy Juice
And I pipe her, call me the plumber

I'm feelin' kinda sick
Shorty cause my last flip got hit with some counterfeit
Whole damn hundred
Must of been desperate
Be out here bein' greedy, so the line I didn't check it
So I'm sittin' in the spot
Countin' on my knot
Pistol on the flo' while I'm sittin' on the couch
Then I heard a knock
I know this bet' not
I was so damn excited I forgot to grab the Glock
Snatched open the do'
Gave my dawg the nod
And pieced his ass up while he was reachin' for that do' nob
Grabbed his head and kneed him in his chin
Put 'em in a headlock, kicked him in the shin
Got him on the ground
Hands on the throat
But guess what the fuck this nigga started reachin' fo'?
Lucky for me my nigga peeped him, changed the moment
Cause at that very point, shit went in slow motion
Picked up the heater
Cocked that bitch back
Squeezed two times saw a real bright flash
"Tat tat"
Then the fiend started screamin'
Ran out the apartment with his right calf leakin'
Then we chase after
Heater still smokin'
Caught him in the alley and let that bitch open
"Tat tat"
He squeezed two mo' at my man
And next thing we heard he gettin' picked up in an ambulance
Next day
Chillin' feelin' proper
We just smokin' some Mustafah
Hash in it, and we ain't even mention it
Around this time playin' 2K1
We were so young and dumb dawg we even kept the gun
And if we got caught dawg we would've got hungYou might also likeEmbed

Came up off the porch, straight serving off the cizzurb
Long time ago, I don't do that shit no more
This the last time I'mma tell you, wanna hear it? (Here it goes!)
It was me and Baby James, with an ounce to our name
Rolling up two at a time, same clothes from yesterday
Had a smoke around a custo, paid his ass a stone
When the narcs came and raided hid on the roof and smoked bong
Fuck with rat bitches, head from them hunnies
Lost a sack but I got back, cause the dice game was hitting
It was me and Carbo, breaking day in the lobby
Nigga popping NoDoz, selling rocks as a hobby
Bankroll in my pocket, so everybody know me
Went home and gave my momma three hundred for some groceries
We hit the mall and ball, hit the club and spend it all
Now I'm back to Square A with them squares to get off

Renaissance like a sculpture in my backyard
Same nigga used to get F's on his report card

And I put that on great granddaddy's soul
Told me I'mma fuck bitches and always have hoes
So let me call another bitch up
A nigga tryna get his dick suck
Make my toes curl up when you licking my nuts
So when I call bitch, you better pick up
So let me call another bitch up
A nigga tryna get his dick sucked

Nah, what you think this is
I ain't paying for your cab bitch you ain't getting shit
Nah, but a mouth full of kids
Told the bitch take the bus, guess what, she did it
Blew a nigga down like the wolf did the straw house
'til I huffed and puffed and shot it in her mouth
Now I got the skinnies sagging with the dirty chucks
Thrift store tee cost a nigga four bucks
Now hipster bitches bomb a nigga like Pearl Harbor
Swear to God, I treat a ho like I ain't got a daughter
Might as well do the same to my baby momma
While all my new hoes look like Jane Fonda
Bump techno and drive little-ass Honda
Give me brain and they say they learnt from they momma
Say she bi and make out with her best friend
Love it to death, but she ain't lesbian

I had to be like 15
My dog ain't have his ills but copped a Cutlass Supreme
Clean from an old white dude, he got a deal
And at the gas station where he got killed
Late night filling up, niggas shot him up
Asleep when the call came, news when I woke up
17 car-jacked, dead at the Mobil
I swear I shed a tear every time I see a photo
Now I'm all grown up same spot cop Swishers
Old school Chevy check the rear view mirror
Give a bum a buck, show the lil niggas love
Pocket full of kush, so I hit 'em with a nug
My homie left the hood, I ain't seen him in a minute
Pull up smoking reggie with his bitch in a rental
He said "I just got out" and can I let him hold something
I told him that I'm broke, man I ain't got nothing

And I'm out (Aight then)
In a '87 Cutty 'bout to go pick up a light skin
And I'm out (Aight then)
Blowing on some kush the color Minnesota Viking
And I'm out (Aight then)
Catch me swooping up a freak and I'm knowing how my night ends
And I'm out (Aight then)
Saying killa has some lightning, pipe blue or pipe thin

See this is all we know
Just running 'round the hood dog with nowhere to go
Wanna grab some Swishers but the narcs at the store
So we parked at my man's, put the chronic on hold
So now we just posting, drinking on some 40's
My nigga got his 40 said drop him at his shorty's
Told my nigga chill, 'bout to roll one with hash
Soon as the hook leave then my nigga we can smash
All in rotation, puff-puff passing
Eyes like cherries through magnifying glasses
Think I got the munchies, my nigga, you hungry?
'Bout to run to Cork Town grab us some mudgies
The blunt turned to ash, gave a dap and laughed
Drunk the rest of the 40, threw the bottle in the trash
Made sure I had my phone, grabbed a square out the pack
Gave my homie that, jumped in the Cutty then I smashed

And I'm out (Aight then)
In a '87 Cutty 'bout to go pick up a light skin
And I'm out (Aight then)
Blowing on some kush the color Minnesota Viking
And I'm out (Aight then)

Got my young, light-skinned ho rolling up the tree
Wearing jackets in the house, it's a Michigan winter
Boiling water on the stove, Ramen noodles for dinner
Dope fiends out the halfway house and they still sniffing
Homie mommy's 50, smoking and still tricking
Still talking shit with this loosie, I'm ash flicking
See my breath when I talk, but nigga, I ain't tripping
Landlord is, the nigga tryna put us out
Selling all the samples, can't afford to give 'em out
Just copped a half-track, see my nigga tryna get it
Standing on the baseline, Scottie Pippen pivot
Needles in they arms just to keep the lights on
Shit, fuck around, be on hardcore pawn

Ran a bath with the Calgon and take you away
You know I can't cook, so I made a bowl of soup
Rub your feet on the futon and TIVO soup's

Just escape for the moment and let your problems rest

Cause today's 'bout you
Wanna see that pretty smile, so what you wanna do?

Dog

Remember one time, dog, this fiend owed the boss
Put peanut butter on her pussy, let his pits lick it off
Back when I was living on Flanders
Seen another dope fiend beat another with a hammer
Remember at the park, seen a nigga at the payphone
Got rocked in his dome, Mama picked me up and ran home
Was like fucking seven years old
When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove
Damn near burned his top lip off, so my mind ticked off
Desensitized to a lot of things, mind would drift off
Wish it was what I seen on TV
I snapped out of that, unc' beating on my auntie
Gunshots outside was sorta like fireworks
We know they ain't fireworks—it's December 21st
Cold winter with a kerosene heater
On the couch, so cold, can't take off your sneakers

And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen, nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors

Can tell that I scared him by the look on my face
Reached in my pocket, served him, nervous as a surgeon
Can't believe where I'm at, 'posed be writing verses
Heard a knock at the door, 'nother fiend wanted four
Gave him what he came for, told him, "Go to the store
Let me get a box of Swishers, Faygo Cola"
Gave his ass another stone, now, guess what? It's over
He ain't coming back
Before I could look back, I heard the wood on the door crack
And they yelling, "Police!"
With this work up in my jeans, man, this a bad dream

I start to wonder
Why time moves so slow
No matter how much I implore

The thoughts are cloudy
In the marijuana sky, but it started raining molly
It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself
Cause I don't know this bitch name but I'm feeling on her breast
I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care
A whole week went past, I ain't gone nowhere
Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus
Daughter sending me messages saying "Daddy, I miss you"
But in this condition I don't think she need to see me
Ain't slept in four days, and I'm smelling like seaweed
Problems in my past haunt my future and the present
Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings
Sent a couple G's but that make it no better
And now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy tryna get all together
Been stressed for so long, think depression done set in

It's time for me to clean it up

Pops left mom when I was only 18
So rightfully that meant I had to be the man of things
And by 28, mom was damn near homeless
And now I'm 31, she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit
Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares
Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair
Cases had me locked up, mama always wrote me
Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me
That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags
Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week
For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care
I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there
I sent my mom some G's, but that makes it no better
Cause now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy tryna get it all together
I been stressed for so long, think depression done set in

I was thinking 'bout something, but I ain't worried 'bout nothing
Remember when I was struggling, fucked up on my knuckles
Tryna sell some dirt weed, taxing off a ten speed
Money wasn't coming, for sure nigga I kept fronting

I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way

And I kept licking on that clit 'til she gave me that shit
I've been fucked up for so long, swear to God I gotta get it
I put my back into it, serving bags to them students
Tell 'em I got that fire on that porch right there by the Buick
I'm just tryna get my mind, go worry nigga 'bout yours
Rolling up that Swisher, pouring up a four
Serving in them hallways, the courtrooms all day
Hoods kicked the door down, now we in the Coney

Everybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up
It's killing me, niggas wanna get rid of me
Cause I lyrically bust on the riddim, fill the room with humidity
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm banging out
Doubling my money getting my hustle in Canning Town
Listen up Danny Brown, I been doing this thing
Skipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em
(I had my dubs on the step)
I never stopped cause I sit in the booth, flipping the truth
While you're running and chatting, thinking you're realer than Screw
You ain't so why you act, dummy, you think you bad, well that's funny
I'm tryna get Maybach money, I'm a Mac Miller, spitting A$AP Rocky

Hé bien peut-être l'oiseau
L'oiseau qui dormait en chacun de nous
S'élèvera

Hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel
Everybody thirsty, and they looking for a refill
If the gang eating, guns barking at your doggy bag
Get took out for your take out now you carry out
Murder by delivery, married at the Paramount
I just coughed up a fair amount of niggas might air it out
Judge a book by cover, so we never educated
It ain't about races, poor and rich segregated
Just to get the bacon, dog, you gotta go HAM
Use to be lost until I found who I am
But it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands
Locked, tryna get real creative with some Spam
Glock tend to jam cause a nigga serve butter
Just to get a little bread had to keep the mayo smothered
All I really wanted was to overdub my vocals
But no one ever thought that I would take it past local
High like 'top a totem, man, somebody shoulda told 'em
That if money grow on trees, being rich is dime a dozen

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self—I don't need your help, homie
'Cause don't nobody really know me
Say, nobody really know me

Gone for three days, ain't nobody ever heard about—
How I got them Jordans, but that ain't too important
When I got a bitch pregnant, and I'm stacking for abortion
And all I really wanted was to give myself a portion
Lit up off the Henny, got a nigga self-absorbing
Smoking on a bogey, no bust-down, who can I trust now?
A lady snitchin', got the whole block down
Now, we gon' eat now
No rebound when you're boxed-out, belly of the beast now
Now, you got me feeling trapped, and I can't look back
When the road ahead is gold and the past is made of ash
And I'm going through the trash, tryna find a little treasure
Living for the better, tryna get myself together

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self—I don't need your help, homie
'Cause don't nobody really know me

Ain't no way gonna sleep with a whitey, rob my nigga, ho so furry

Codeine in my cereal
Always behind a smokey, I'm sorta like a miracle
You rappers are venereal, and never in my stereo
Might spray your ass with vinegar, the next time that I see ya bro
Bet your ass still won't be tight
The size of my dick, nigga, every pussy tight
I write all night 'til the sun come up
Dodging texts from your sister tryna lick on my nuts
Cobra clutch the game, put that bitch into submission
Your bitch want the stick shift, no transmission
Dawg, I'm on a mission, you're playing exhibition
On an expedition, popping X but never tripping
Chilling with a vixen, tryna stick my dick in
Red head ho, like a young Kathy Griffin
Smoked so many blunts, I can hear my lungs whistling
Still rolling up, ho smelling like chicken
Rap Martin Lawrence, all you other rappers boring
Bruiser make 2 Live Crew look like some mormons
Nigga my essay is hard like a life-doing ese
Gang-banging on the yard with a home made machete
Been nice since cassette tapes, stay smoking heavy
Popped a couple pills, eye's glowing like Belly
Used to stash the cracks in the seams of my Pelle
Detroit nigga, but I'm smoking on LA

Hotel room like a hair metal concert

For dinner nigga used to eat shit that didn't match
Like cornbeef hash and some fucking Apple Jacks
Used to bag up the packs and eat Coney every night
Bologna all night, traps with no peanut butter
Couldn't waste it on the mice, so I wasted every night
Everything came with rice, and I knew I wasn't right
So I got my ass up, fuck depending on luck
Greyhound to NY 'bout 300 bucks
Kept my hopes up but my confidence was low

Backwood of that good to the pain for the brain
A cup of lean for me to sleep, see I be going through thangs
Music business got me stressed Xanax to maintain
Waking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain
Vicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle
Remember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers
And now I, got the whole world listening
Give your ear for a second a life changing decision
Every other minute thoughts run through my mind
'bout how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time
So I'm trapped in the beat, stuck on every line
Nothing else matters, except my next rhyme
You can never understand all the pressure I'm against
Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit

Might have a mental breakdown
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on
Let's go, hop up in the Chevy four-door
Let's roll (I float on)

Remember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread
And niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head
It's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim
And to beat your enemy, you gotta think like them
So I was up late breaking day with the gremlins
Music in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen
Hood outta bye-bye cause rap shit was sci-fi
So I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes
Can't get a wink 'less I'm leaning off of syrup
Dreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up
Staring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away
Until the verse is done wrote all day but them shit's throwaway
So I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing
And not for the money for the life after dying
Pray I get old just to hear I been the future
Just to see my influence in this genre of music

And might make it to see somehow
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth

From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas

Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists
'Bout to feed her kids at night, sit between her legs and twist
While she listen to the oldies, soap operas, smoking bogies
On the phone, gossiping, telling homegirls stories
Girlfriend worried 'cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state pen' or a cemetery buried
Ma replied, do her best, but it's still rough
Keep your kids off the street and away from drugs
Doing hair in the house, ain't putting on Daniel
Daddy in and out: "Ayy, who turned that channel?"
Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back
Ashing her cigarette in a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, laughing, tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove, put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going

On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
Said "Go get some bread and a pop and come back"
Walk out the door, first thing I see
A dope fiend standing there looking at me
Standing right there, in front of the porch
With a pipe in his hand, in the other, a torch
I kept on moving, ain't worried 'bout that
'Bout a block later heard rat-tat-tat-tat
Next, some niggas from over there shooting
Dog I ain't blinked just kept it a-moving
Block later up, what do I find?
A junkie ho, at left and right, crime
Flagging up cars, getting her bread

Dried up blood on that baggie, I done scraped myself with that razor
Getting head in that trick house and I snuck out without paying her
Locked up in that precinct, used my Timberland for a pillow
Break the dank in that swizzle, riding 'round in a dope fiend rental
Pulling up on ya baby momma, like bitch what you tryna get into?
If you ain't about that sucking, then ho you can keep on trucking
I'm getting mine straight up, no middle man, nigga I don't like you
Fool's Gold the clique, and musically we don't fuck with you
Went from holding crack in my ass crack to racks on racks on ASCAP
Coulda rhymed ASCAP with ass capped, Jadakiss already said that
Do it for the days when for dinner, all a nigga had to eat was a couple of conies
Broke as fuck and no bitch will fuck, in my basement, jerking off lonely
Used to fall off fucking with the work, but guess what I'm back on ho
No more messing on that couch, now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth
And I gag her 'til she cry, on her stomach fluid come up
I be fucking her face on the daily, you be kissing that bitch in the mouth

Then land on my dick from the back
Look I ain't tripping, no, I ain't kidding
Have her licking my head like a cat
Now shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose
Come and let a young real nigga cut
But nah, bitch, this dick ain't free
So she copped my dick and then cuffed
Now come here chick and let me feed you nuts
Cum on her ass and have a lioness
How her mouth can be wide as her legs

Hit it raw cause I'm with the shit
Gave her the pipe, said she need a fix
Gave you life, you can't believe the sight
Take the wood like a termite

Even played a lil' house with your sister

Why the  can do more than fist her

Want you to snitch so they can hit the jackpot
Rappers make it sound good 
But they don't tell you bout the rock with the 
The real Rick Ross sold work for the feds
Used to get fronted work, my man wanted his bread
Back in 2000 and niggas still poor
Matter fact crack ain't even poppin' no more
Now your best bet is fucking with the trees
Don't slang for what you want, slang for what you need
A-Town niggas talking bout they flipping keys
Detroit run Atlanta nigga ask Big Meech

Niggas in my city always talking bout the bag
Never sold crack, just the crack of their ass
Flip more stones than a fucking archaeologist
Smart like scholarships to two colleges
Skipped class had to quench my thirst
Now i'm jumping fiends who ain't pay me on the first
Rocks in my socks, jeans 
Remember having dreams I ain't never coming home
Lost in the streets can't find my way
Hit 
Getting paid while my ho's kiss J's
Niggas in the streets know Brown don't play
Competition snitchin', hood caught me pitchin'
Now i'm in the Coney, cooking in the kitchen
Year later back home no time
Only thing I know is going back to the potYou might also likeEmbed

I take a blunt to the face late night watching (breath low?)
Pray for paper, writing rhymes about dope
Cause when a block's slow, tell me what's next
Wonder why I'm running in your crib with the tech
Hell with no job, unemployment having high fiend
If it ain't a crack rock, next day die
Hell to work they life and I really don't know
Why they wanna give it back to the damn casino
This world is a joke but I really can't laugh
Cause the tank kinda low, they killin' us for gas
Child support warrent, licensed bimbo
Tail light broke on the way to the store
Used to wear my daddy clothes sneaking in his closet
Now I can cop the winter line in August
Used to sell rocks now I can rock your baby mama
Hit her with a text, let her scoop me in the Honda

Give us any chance we'll take it
Read us any rule we'll break it
We're gonna make our dreams come true
Doin' it our way
Nothing's gonna turn us back now
Straight ahead and on the track now
We're gonna make our dreams come true
Doin' it our way
There's nothing we won't try
Never heard the word impossible
This time there's no stoppin' us
We're gonna do it
On your mark get set and go now
Got a dream and we just know now
We're gonna make that dream come true
And we'll do it our way
Yes our way
Make all our dreams come true

Been in this room for 3 days
Think I’m hearing voices
Paranoid and think I’m seeing ghost-es, oh shit
Phone keep ringing but I cut that shit off
Only time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off
Had a threesome last night, ain’t matter what it cost
Couldn’t it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft
Had to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed
Been grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw
Nothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring
Your worst nightmare for me is a normal dream
And if I learned anything

Knocking on my door but I won’t answer

We was so ambitious
All we really wanted was new Jordans and some bitches
Flashing bankrolls in the club taking pictures
Thinking we was grown men, really lil' niggas
Jumping dope fiends that's owing us for credit
Taking turns catching sales things copacetic
Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce

You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just release me

Feeling like I got money
Know I'm just nigga rich
Even if she fuck me
I still know life a bitch
Bought a nightmare, sold a dream
Happiness went upstream
Blame myself, I had no control
Now I'm living with no soul
I'm on a road that never ends
Don't know opposite of sin
Some people say I think too much
I don't think they think enough
Time rough but it got rougher
Weight heavier up on my shoulders
Living crooked 'til it's over
Can't be straight, can't be sober
Thought process so immature
Can't make it up, up out the sewer
Feeling like there's no hope
Blaze dope, my mind float
I love her, she love me
Love ain't enough with no bucks
Fucked up, that's the way it is
I don't know who I should trust
Riding around with the windows up

You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just re-

All that I know
All that I know is to feel your shame
'Cause you can't let go
'Cause you can't let go, you drive me insane
But will I ever find my way?
Or go back to the beginning
There's a thing that I know for sure15Embed
I’m like Kubrick
With 2 bricks
And hoes on the strip
Off a 2 piece
A toothpick I flick
And I preach
Bout how I’m a get this money out here up in the streets
In the Caddy Ron Isley on between in the sheets
And a way a nigga work make a grip in a week
I’m a chill with this freak
Sniff a gram and a half
Plus her pussy juicier than Shalamar curl bag
While she draw me a bath
Roll a blunt then passed
Jiggled and giggled her booty
Couldn’t do nothing but laugh
Credit cards separating
White lines on a mirror
Roll a 100 dollar bill
Now my sinus all clearer
Flat screen porn on
Watching Asa Akira
Nothing on but my pinky ring
Sniff when I get up
On the balcony drunk
Like the world is mine
Staggering inside with my robe untied

So fuck waiting round
Nigga I’m about to get it
Dog I’m tryna eat
So I’m staying in the kitchen
Hunched over the stove
Gotta water water whip it
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring
Packing up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping
Lost on the sauce but a nigga ain’t flipping
Cutting up the hard like the yard ain’t filling

I'm like Spielberg
With ill words and hoes on that curb
Gotta screw loose
I'm cuckoo
Mentally disturbed
But still smart enough
To hit this bitch wit a rubber
And with ya wrinkle pussy
Hoe can’t be ya lover
But I still get the head
If you swallow with bubbles
I'm a Linwood nigga I done traveled the world
Made a name for myself use to serve on the curb
Now my words worth a bird
I could front you a zip
Made a million in a year and I still ain’t trip
Bout to put my niggas on make a million for them
Show you that you can make it without acting like them
Do you lil nigga go out there and just get it
Gotta have a hardback
Because these niggas gon’ whip it
Do you lil nigga get up out there get it
Gotta have a hardback
Because these niggas gon’ whip it
So fuck waiting round
Nigga I’m about to get it
Dog I’m tryna eat

Verbal couture, parkour with the metaphors
The flow house of horror, dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch, six sense with a nose drip
Mind skydive, sniffing bumps in the cockpit
Locksmith of hip-hop, appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size as the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic, prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends 'cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke just to sniff, need a ski lift
Flip your table over if you cut it with the bullshit
Nosebleed on red carpets, but it just blend in
Snapping pictures feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life, seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left so I try to seize the moment

Funny how it happens who ever would imagine
That joke's on you but Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?

Nose running right now, could ya pass me a napkin?

Panic when the drugs are gone and nobody is answering

Say ya need to slow down 'cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing
Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing
It's a living nightmare, that most of us might share
Inherited in our blood, it's why we stuck in the mud
Can’t quit the drug use or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to, tell you what I'm gonna do
I’ma wash away my problems with this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me so I'm popping them Xannies
Might need rehab but to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y'all 'cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8-ball of coke and my nigga on the way
Got three hoes with him and they all tryna play
Funny how it happens who ever would imagine

Bust it open
Flake looking like gold dust
Nigga get a whiff of this uncut
Bloody Marys at brunch
From last night still drunk
Popped a Adderall nigga that was my lunch
And I gotta hunch
Roll another blunt
Call some hoes up nigga lets do some bumps
Caught up in the whirlwind
Life took a tail spin
Hid behind designer shades
Life of sin
Lost control
Don’t have a soul
Myself I don’t know no more
Numbing up with drugs
To suppress these feelings
Praying to the heavens
Letting these devils get the best of me
Nigga what’s the recipe for a good time
A whole lot of liquor while you doing coke lines
Residue on my mustache
How could it last
Roll a hundred dollar bill

Now I do way it more then I use to
Have no clues
All the false alarms
Where most would've died
But my tolerance strong
Been cursed all along
Whole family addicts
Floating through my bloodstream
Like I gotta have it
Tried to quit a few times
But it didn’t work out
Can you understand
What my life is about
Cause I think you don’t
So take a step inside
A mind so horrific
Images that I hide
Take look inside
Scare you for life
This is the way
Nigga step inside
Mimosa for breakfast
With a thick hoe from Texas
Got good karma
Feel the persona
Got the Hermes towel while I'm up in the sauna
Smoking on ganja
Tasting like caramel
Ass so fat think she get it from her mama
Came along way hitting thots in spots
Now I fuck pornstars I done jerked off and watched
Spending racks up in  Bergdorf
Bitches take ya shirt off
Took a couple molly’s
Now they wanna have a twerk off
Guess who the judge
Why they hold the grudge
Me I done got it on my own out the mud
Will it all last
Will it all last
Roll a hundred dollar bill
Nigga blow cash
Will it all last

8 balls with a safety pin
I deserve the finer things
Told myself back then when I used to ride a Schwinn
Now I'm on a tour bus going places I ain't never been
Wrote my rhymes down on a paper bag
That was way back
Having dreams of a Cadillac
Dog, I had to bounce back
Locked a nigga up, why they do me like that?
Now I'm on the jack in the county asking mommy for some money
Swear to God she'd do anything for me
Now we out the hood and the nightmare is us going back
So I won't go to sleep 'til I finish that
Cousin of death anyway
Now I see better day
Miss a minute, second, hour
Living on borrowed time, can't think about tomorrow
'Cause it's 'bout today
And you know you wanna take my place
Let's get it

You turn around and now I'm winning
I built it up from the ground
You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it
I built it up from the ground

Now tell me, would you sacrifice your dreams?

Got me missing sleep 'cause my mind on the beat
So while I'm counting bars, y'all be counting sheep
No cheat sheet, get it out the mud
Get it how you live, why I'm out here in the field
My nigga, wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes
It's a cold, cold world, but even hotter when you die
So no try to do, what about you?
Work hard for where I'm at, do the same thing too
A lot locked up wishing they was like you
Got a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June
Been down for a minute and every since sentence
Things ain't been the same, so I'm missing my nigga
Staring at the ceiling thinking how far I came
Was trapped in the storm, but I made it out the rain

You turn around and now I'm winning
I built it up from the ground
You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it
I built it up from the ground11Embed
Watch who you 'round, gotta watch they mouth
When them guns come out and them shots ring out, you know what they about
Watch what they say, watch what they do
When a hook come around, them kids come down, they'll tell on you
It's snakes in the grass gettin' trapped by rodents
Potent we smoking'll leave you choking
Hoping you focused, so dog, take notice
'Fore a flash of light run you off like roaches
Hopping off porches with chrome for focus
Nose long as song made by Mike Bolton
Lightning bolts rip through your torso
Raining blood after that thunder
Mama crying, children wonder
But this is the life that we all succumb to
Make a nigga wanna go and cut his phone off
Cops kill a nigga every day like protocol
Watch the TV, turn on the news
Make a nigga feel like he listened to blues
In the hood with that Arm & Hammer
Gettin' them Pampers for baby mama
Hood flicked us, we in the slammer
Now your baby raised by another man, bruh
Cure for cancer, cure for A.I.D.S. 
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Everywhere you go, gotta keep that tool
'Cause you don't want it end up happen to you
So everywhere you go, gotta keep that tool

I'm blowing on some Miles, something kind of blue
The kind of dope you swear could make dreams come true
Sticky icky nugs, real furry buds
This my party pack, call it the cotton club
Towel under the door, hotboxin' hotels
Security knockin', what's that smell?
Ornette with a fortress
Scorching frontos on porches
Torching up the purple
Got me spinning in a circle
I'm Coltrane on Soul Plane
Propane flow game
Bitches know my name from Cancún to Spokane
Got it in my carry-on
Smoke it 'til it's all gone
No homo, but your bitch go Tommy Dorsey on my trombone
I hit the greenery, jaws go Gillespie
Have a nigga shakin' like he got epilepsy
I hit it twice, then I pass it to the right
Mary Jane, you be the love of my life

Say you had a bad day, you want the stress to go away
Just roll up and take the pain away
And get high

Holy spirit
When I look, I cannot see reflection in the mirror
I broke bread with the Judas and I think I see it clearer
These niggas want what's mine, but I'll be damned if I'ma give up
Stuck up in the hood, praying rap would get me out
Mama 'bout to lose her house, gotta figure this shit out
Used to catch the bus to 12th just to hustle for some Prada
In the kitchen with my uncle, beat the pot like a piñata
Baraka with the product, used to hide it in my closet
Type of shit that have a fiend crawling on his carpet
Walking over carcasses of artists in my garden
Nice with the bars, even the beat begs my pardon
Got me mistaken, Muslim salami bacon
Always on the defense, so it's no offense taken
I'm smokin' on them raisins from the bay, they taste amazing
Cajun, kicking flavor all the time, not on occasion
Would be amazed, all the time, I heard I wouldn't make it
I was writing shit that was so damn amazing
When half these little niggas was still watching That's So Raven
I was out there hustling, scrapin' up and saving
Just to catch a twelve hour bus to NY
Sleepin' on the floor in studios, asking God, "Why?"
But never got deterred from the voice I heard inside
Tell myself every day the greatest that's alive

Wanna cry right now, so I'm wishing that it rain

Can't explain why we live with so much sorrow
Guess the stories of today'll be a movie tomorrow
Mama always said there'd be days like this
Ain't got my own pot so in the alley I piss

I daydream around palm trees
Blowin' haze in the day, summertime breeze
But in reality I just blow my breath
Let the Michigan cold numb my flesh
I need a tissue 'cause my nose is runnin'
Faced harsh winters, locked hot summer
Fuck the president, and the next running
None of them niggas gon' let me hold something

I take one step forward and two steps back

Drowned by the street, floated back to shore
Now I swim in cash and I still want more

Used to sip colds (?), now we waste Clicqout
Used to ask Mama, why we gotta be poor
Days got hard, nights got rough
Used to eat a coney on the Gratiot bus

Preacher took my money now he got a new truck
Best friend a snitch when his life on the line, soft niggas
Turn tough when they bust that nine

Right up in the same pot unc' cooked the rock
Went from flippin' on mats to flippin' them sacks
Hide and seek, send spots to out on, we sell crack, facts
War on drugs was a chess game
Was a pawn, guns drawn on my front lawn
Just a young nigga, starin' down the corner
Checkin' out the hustlers with the latest kicks on 'em
Know a nigga want, mama ain't got it
Fuckin' up in school, lyin', what she know about it?

Jumped off the porch, really, I wasn't ready for it
Get up out the hood, find a way out

Still drop dirty, have to pop a Niacin
Itched all damn day, just to get violated
Ever seen a roach with babies have babies?
In the hood like whatever, we in this bitch together
Once got a ho, ain't had money for the room
So we did the humpty hump in a Burger King bathroom
Lowkey kept it undercover
The way she slurp slurp, she's the quicker picker upper
No job, dropped out and a felon
On the net, met a fat white bitch named Helen
300 pounds, maybe more like 280
Had a couple babies, 270 give or take it
Call that securin' the bag, had to fight the baby dad
Try to stop how I eat so I got up on his ass

What's in the dark, always come to light
Head was nasty, you'd think she had head lice
Why try? Throw bleach in your eye
Put your life on the line, hang 'em out to dry
Tryna keep my hands clean, out here ridin' dirty
Shit get messy? Mop him up with the .30
High Tide, Gain off the Arm and Hammer
Swim towards the current, system try to drown me
Stain your record like Clorox 'n' darks
Spin cycle had four tops for one
Out the slums, nobody gave me nothin'
Had temptations, so I hustled, David Ruffin

Left my wallet at home, ain't wanna hear that story
In the car had change from laundry
Had to wash clothes anyway, told her, "I'm sorry"
Slow anyway, before you was boring
Said, "Gimme a moment", jumped on it and bounced
No fabric softener, 'cause I was hard
Then she gave me head, had me moaning and groaning
Guess who I seen doing laundry next morning?14Embed
They thought I was gone, back from the grave
Mind of a master, blood of a slave
Heart of a king, stuck in between
The devil and an angel on my shoulder when I speak
Lost in the streets, found on the beat
Still kept a clip, asked, and got it for cheap
Now I'm in the world where they pray for the weak
Stand-up niggas take shots to the knees
Lord, have mercy, pray for me
Need to calm down, so pass me the weed
Got me stressed out, situations look bleak
Time's runnin' out, how'd my days turn to weeks?

Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in my drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up

I'ma keep goin', you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up

Leather inside, dark-tinted window
Wood-grain wheel, tell me how you really feel
Ride past all the kids, yellin' out, "Bingo"
Talk a good game, Trey Wingo

Meet Heaven and you gotta know evil
Heart of a lion, eye of a eagle
Life a movie, but ain't no sequel
Switch lanes in that new thing
Got on that red line while I'm playing Flock of Seagulls
So, no way we could ever be equal
In the hay stack, I was that needle
Hold it in, thinkin' no one will believe you
Lose it all in a second, like #MeToo

Pray you lose it all, one second, all gone
Ayy, know you feelin' all alone
But who can you turn to when things go wrong?
Ayy, it's the plot all along
Push you down the wrong path, the statistics have shown
Everything that I known turned out to be lies
Found out when I was grown so I shared that light
On these dark undertones, had a nigga head gone
Why they buy the diamonds and the car with shiny chrome
My fault, all alone in the scheme of it all
Played like a bong, had to stay strong
Got my head above water, had to keep movin' on

Twelve-gauge shotguns, I seen twelve-gauge, um, pumps

I don't give a fuck

Tell me, "What's up?"
All about the game, so I'm hunting big buck
Big butt, slim waist, and her hair long
Pass it down to me like a heirloom
The Henny got me wetter than whale piss
I die for this shit like Elvis
Boss up and shake down
Get it jumpin' like a techno breakdown
Night young and we just gettin' started
Let me walk on yard at the Bruiser Brigade party
Got smoke, of course
Goin' up, fireworks on the Fourth
Take mine, and I do it with force
Been with this shit since I jumped off the porch
Used to chop grams on my Grandma's faucet
Pay me what it costs, I ain't tryna hear offers
Tryna play Brown, you be hangin' with Hoffman
Copped a pound and I broke it down in ounces
Bust it open like them hoes came in
Got more pills than the Olsen twins
Focus, I can see where ocean is
Kush stankin' like it broke the wind

Wasn't thinkin' 'bout no lawyer, nigga, fuck savin'
Didn't know we'd see them horrors like Wes Craven
Hook jumpin' out them vans, throw us on pavement
Locked up with dirty white boys, all musty
Prayin' for probation, hope I get lucky
Court-appointed lawyers, gotta stay coppin'
Put you in predicament, but that's your only option
Sink or swim, look at him in the system
Just another nigga, one-way ticket to a prison
Tried to help, only hurt in the end

Kinda cloudy like them diamonds that them rappers wear
Clowning like jesters that be in front of kings chairs
But they don't make a crown big enough to fit my head
My self-esteem high, see it can nest eggs
I'm sipping vodka straight, eating on fish eggs
Cashmere, and the color pastel
Used to have that crack like the liberty bell
But now I hit chicks with lips like Estelle
New SL, lights like fish eyes
Bitches say the dick good like Mickey D's French fries
Y'all never held weight, sorta like an ant thigh
Think you're doing bad? Think about Apartheid
Look in a narc's eyes, ask him why he flicked me
Said, "Brown, I had to, just look at your history"
Tried to tell the dude the truth
He still reminiscing when he used to lock me up for curfew
But I was just a young nigga staying past street lights
Kinda fascinated finding out what the streets like
Learned my lesson, for sure changed my ways
But the hook still treat me like the kid I was yesterday

And I'm still that nigga
We just getting started, roll another swisher
Crack another brew, cop another fifth
These rap niggas trash and all their beats filth

Pleading guilty to anything they offer us
Copping out like quitting police officers
But we off it bruh, cases we forfeit
6's high, hope the 24's fit
Instigate beef and we all get torched

The Shakespeare of sixteens, dipping my ink pen
Made a sculpture of me, but my dick was too thin
Paint pictures of me, but they never get my chin
One writing scriptures, bringing tears to the princess
Every time I indent, you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent, hanging onto every sentence
Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants 'cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide
I'm the town hero 'cause my words give 'em pride
And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for
Leave 'em all astonished, ride with the verbs
Make a grown man cry with strength of the words

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid

Business cards from her attorney
Got probation 'cause her parents paid the money
Six-month rehab, but she back at it
Reflection stares at her, but she can't look at it
She wiped out the debit card, owin' on the credit
For student loans, they call her phone, but she don't sweat it
Cocaine on counter tops, separatin' lines
Every time she do it, she say this her last time
Chasin' that high from the very first time
Back in her dorm room in 2009
Never thought this relationship would come this far
Rolled singles in her nose, on plates, sniffin' hard
In nightclub stalls, her and her friends sniff it all
Never sleepin', random dude's apartment, missed calls
Unreplied texts from her boyfriend
Feeling like any second, the world can end
And when it freeze her, it make her pussy wet
Face rushin', goin' numb, nipples hard on them breasts
Sniffin' 'til it drip
Back of the class, blood runnin' down her lipsYou might also like3Embed
I was born one day before Saint Pat
I guess a nigga miss luck just like that
Henry Ford, not even one mile from Motown
Explains all the soul that you hear in my sound
A ten minute ride to Linwood, I begun
My mama first son, look what I just become
A weedhead with words more potent than what I'm smoking
And this ain't no reggie, caught the plane ride from Oakland
I used to play with pistols in crackhouses
Skippin' school just to fuck bitches on dirty couches, abandoned houses
Find one with the lights on it
Landlord came, pulled the hook, now it's locks on it
Money? I'm plotting on it, I put the block on it
I'm gon' get it, four deep, no shocks on it
We sit low, rep the D 'cause it's all I know

Passin' 'round forties, brown paper bags
Rolling up a Swisher while this rat freak a Black
It ain't about nothing, but let me hold something
Ate a Lunchable for dinner, nigga, I ain't fronting
Caught the bus to Eastland just to walk around it
Ain't buy nothing, nigga, just walked around it
Looked at some hoes, I ain't even holler

This is anti-clean rap, nigga, where the green at?
Risks I take, you'd swear I had the balls the size of beanbags
Not what you're used to, bitch, I rep the Bruiser
And the label Fools Gold, jeans with medusas
Bitches wanna scoop us, get pussy like loofahs
Y'all niggas losers, cop clothes from them boosters
Hoes wanna choose up, of course they gon' choose us
So though you need a stylist, also you need a tutor
These stupid-ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas, guess what that makes you?
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fail
'Cause they don't care about music, just first-week sales

So they say you need a hit, a chart-topping single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash club banger, play it all night long
You never get on without a radio song
So this my radio song
This my radio song

She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thing on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'ma make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk
Until it's skeet-skeet on the walls and her shirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, 'cause bitch, I ain't tricking
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch, I ain't Puffy
Ice cream paint job, semi with the hemi
Heavy-duty Chevy, not a Bimmer, Benz or Bentley
There's no originality, carbon-copy singles
He made "Black and Yellow"? I'ma make "Black and Emo"

The sack I got is lookin' like some green caterpillars
But it's smellin' like a skunk that's oh-so-defensive
These bitches suck my dick like it was moral incentive
I'm off the chain like broke nunchucks
From where these little niggas try to shoot you over new Chucks
A little dark like wet nubuck
Describe my state of mind is inside the tomb of King Tut
Murders all the time is all I see
Detroit 187 on you niggas' TV
And I can first degree this beat, kill a nigga, no charges
Fuck a female MC and a pop artist
Oh, baby, I like it raw
And my dick so big, left stretch marks on her jaw

I'm so institutionalized
I wake up at 6 AM because I think it's chow line
Borderline porcupine, a step from drinking turpentine
Just to wash down a plate of wack rappers' rhymes
I got a mind in the cosmos
And if these niggas cold, then I guess I'm osmosis
That be blowing on some potent that these white boys be growing
While you niggas smoking something smelling like a tanning lotion
Concoctions, make world-ending potions
These other niggas got lines, dog, I got encroachments
I get endorsements, so motherfuck your cosigns
Punch punchlines, I'll punch rappers 'til your broke spine
'Member back in '09, told 'em it was showtime
Now they pull they cam'-phones out when I go for mine
Light, camera, action, Hybrid be snapping

Mind racing like Bristol, heart of igloos

Ain't even had pads, stuffed they panties with tissue

Nigga, that's bland, fuck you up and your mans
I smack you like a bitch, nigga, that's open-hand
Fuck you and your tough talk

Fag, you ain't play sports, but always at the ballpark
Type of nigga rocking Crocs at the fuckin' Walmart

Always tell her yes, never tell her no
Know you think you know everything, but you don't
Wanna do the right thing, but you probably won't

Bottom of the empty glass where you find life
Always left behind because she think she right
Thinkin' that she grown, but always need your advice
And always in a situation that she need your help
But wouldn't help another, only care about herself
In the VIP askin', "Where the drink at?"
Calling her a groupie, you think she really think that?
She just wanna hear that that ass look right

Wanna snort some blow? Pop a lot of pills?

Aluminum siding and had to come back

You know, that one house where Kenneth 'nem use to live
Now it's just another shortcut to the store
The TV in the window drew the line of what was rich and poor
Mommy gave me food stamps and told me buy Wonder Bread
On the way, these niggas jumped me, left me with knots in my head
Went to school yesterday and had to leave early
'Cause niggas said they was gon' jump me at 3:30
All because I lived in the hood they had beef with
And I ain't never tell 'em, dog, I kept that shit a secret
I can't really trip, niggas looked out for me
Them same niggas played me ain't around to tell the story
I'm just a young nigga on the D.O.T
With my headphones on and a sack full of weed
Rhymes in my head, thought nobody wanted to hear 'em
So I had the fiends hittin' rocks like the Pilgrims

Sent your bitch a dick pic and now she need glasses
Turn your bitch Slick Rick right now if I flashed it
Ate a couple pills and took the bud up out the plastic
Flickin' bogey ashes, bitch, I stay blasted
Microphone Cassius, Magic with the sick shit
'Posed to been dead, but bitch, I'm still up in this bitch
Verbal herbal poison, words I contortion
Fucked a pregnant bitch, she save money on her ga-bortion
I feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ
Coverin' Too $hort, smokin' a Newport
Hurt, hoped the drugs would help the pain to go away
But all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray
So step inside the mind that revolves around the rhyme
And every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines
Dyin' in the arms of a blonde, blue-eyed twenty-something
Don't know her name, but the paramedics chest pumpin'
Thirty-something Black male OD'd off of pills
That he weren't prescribed, but they took his life
Left behind a daughter that don't really even know him
'Cause her mama thought he wouldn't make a living off of poems
But it was a long journey on a rocky road
Had a hoodie on and a jacket in the snow
Walkin' in the cold on the way to the studio
Nigga, that was just a couple years ago
Dropped a couple mixtapes on the 'net
Niggas tried to front like I wasn't all that
But guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Signed to Fool's Gold, now everything is all gnarly
Now these bitches want my number to get up in the party
Came a long way from extension cords in the window
Borrow neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo
Where the oven's never closed and the stove's never off
Every winter so cold, niggas sleepin' wearing scarf
But I always tell myself that it's gon' get better
You know who you is? You the greatest rapper ever
So now the pressure's on to prove that voice right
Some people never knew they goals, knew mine my whole life
So now his turn's up, fixin' up to bat
Pitchin' singles to the label when I used to pitch crack
I never learned to rap, always knew how
Ever since a nigga eight, knew what I would do now
When I turned twenty-eight, they like, "What you gon' do now?"
And now a nigga thirty, so I don't think they heard me
That the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed
Tears in my eyes, let me get this off my chest
The thoughts of no success got a nigga chasing death
Doin' all these drugs, hope an OD ain't next, triple-XYou might also like16Embed

But who am I to judge, baby? Want another drink?
Tonight give me your brain, you ain't gotta think

Find you a purse to borrow, beats is like your friends

Best friend 30, she's forever 21
Going down the same path, take another sip

Drunk, fully clothed in tubs, I cut showers on her
But I still love her and I live life for her
She ask me for a dollar, I'm gon' give it to her
Stay drinking on the brew, keep a can in her hand
Tied grocery bag full of keystone cans
Alcoholism has poisoned our city
Liquor store on every corner ain't like that in other cities
So you have a drink, take a hit and pass that
Give a buck to a wino help him buy crack
Dwell on the past, looking towards tomorrow
Wish I could lend my pain, let you borrow my sorrow

Uh... what they did last night
Pills and orange tubes got the government right
They say there's no stopping from starting Oxycontins
They in trailer parks sniffing it with rolled dollars
All about a dollar, baby killers in the world
The ones that supply you, when you gotta fucking cold

When it's hot, you need another drink
What you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside?
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

I see a lot of hoes, they all on my dick
Bunch of player haters wanna front for a bitch
If a bitch want to fuck me, then let her do her thing
Just step the fuck back, and let her give me brain
I'm insane like Hussein
It's like I got two brains
See my shoe game
And say them shit's butane, y'all niggas too lame
My bill game like poontang
Nine niggas on a track like Wu-Tang
Shoot like a two guard from Tulane
Big Ving Rhames niggas at the door
Like, like, like, you rang? No need for ID
Walk straight past security, they don't search me
Put three numbers in my phone 'fore I reach VIP

No not Superman you can call it X-Clan
Black red and green, sissies
All my bitches eat pussy like Missy
But they look like Chrissy
From Three's Company, roll another blunt for me
Smoke so much weed like I'm tryna lose my memory
Like I'm tryna smoke away my mad thoughts
Blunt gave 'em up, a bit too bad go
She wanna hit it, and I do too

My little nigga 14
Got his hand on the 40 with the infrared beam
His daddy locked up and his momma is a fiend
Catch her tricking on the corner, knees dirty on her jeans
At night he never dreams cause he hardly ever sleep
Laying in the bed, facing someone else's feet
So late night he creep, walk around these streets
With the same hoodie on, he been wearing for a week
He wants something to eat, and his sneaks so scuffed
Just looking in his eyes, you can tell he living rough
Standing outside a gas station puffing on a loosie
Dropped outta school cause his peers appeared bougie
And they want Gucci, and shit that rappers talk
Robbed an old lady, but his ass got caught
Will he get out, man I really don't know bro
I hope I'll find out after the guitar solo

After the guitar solo
The guitar solo
After the guitar solo
The guitar solo

This little girl pregnant man she only 14
Bust in by an older nigga, lack of self-esteem
Her mom's a gold digger, and her dad is not around
Last time she saw him he took her to Belle Isle
A child with a child and her momma don't care
Another bridge card gon' put her on welfare
Baby daddy say he got her, prolly won't succeed
Cause he bought a pair of Cardi's 'stead of reing-up the weed
His dream is a cutty with some rims on that bitch
Is that the type of man you want raising your kids?
So now you ditch class cause your belly getting bigger
And every other day your momma fuck another nigga
So what she gonna do is find herself a drug dealer
Her dream and goal in life is to be saved by a nigga
And will she get far? I really don't know bro
I hope I find out after the guitar solo

Same nigga, notebook full of rhymes
My nigga Ace of Base saw the signs
My talent level excel my age
So about age 9, knew that I would rock stage
So it made me think of grades, sort of like catching AIDS
Didn't hit class, I wrote in my notepad
Mimic what I heard, got sicker with the verbs
Figured this the quickest way to get the picket in the 'burbs
Distribute herb, admit I used to dabble, but dawg
The snares a better sound than the gavel
Got so damn hungry, with the work I used to travel
Packets in some drawers, toothpaste in the packets
Tryna leave my habitat, in ways that I've adapted
Sleep different when you on somebody else's mattress
Mental got scarred, change the pace could be advantage
Everybody in the D tryna move to Atlanta

Click your seat fool, get ready to ride
And say good bye we 'bout to go past 8 mile
Brace yourselves only the strong survive
If you alive, we 'bout to go past 8 mile
Its too heavy, hope your heater is deadly
Are you ready? we 'bout to go past 8 mile
Tired of hating with the changes I'm making
I've been waiting just to go past 8 mile

Hate fellas goin' back over the 8
Used to talk to white girls that I knew I couldn't date
Cause we was outta bounds, if we met either way
Now tell me what's the call
When we still gotta go over there to hit the mall
So I'm a take this d shit far
I'm the hybrid meaning sun takin' it past ours
As the summer's get hotter, winter get colder
Sons get locked, and our daughters having daughters
Feel its time to speak, before this shit be out of order
Before you be the nigga out here begging for quarters

And fucked it up at the same time
That pain in my heart, I can't hide
A lot of trauma inside
You can see it in my eyes
Could've ended it in seconds
Just time on my side
Show must go on
Bought a ticket, take the ride
Songs are life, but a dead dream

On my own, gotta get to it
Came too far to right now just lose it
Lost everything in pursuit of my dream
Push everyone away, now no one here for me
Now all everyone do is ask
And when you don't have, they just talk behind your back

We doin' this even without a record deal
Half the shit I say can't be understood by executives
I'm from that crack rock
Pawn your grandma wedding ring
So what the fuck they gon' tell me 'bout anything
Strap up, nigga, get yo boots on tight
I'm from back when Snoop called Luke a 'Frisco dyke
Made moves and went left, and you went right
Niggas wanna be hot 'til they souls on ice
Long as I got the rent, you can't tell me shit
You ain't got it, put you out like Hannibal Buress
Got it all fucked up thinking I won't flourish
'Fore my family sitting starved, you be all malnourished

My raps like Tetris
Bars keep fallin', gotta know whеre to place 'em
Smokе with Dave Chappelle, the nigga think I laced him
Knew it was the pack
He started talkin' 'bout spaceships
I write like, it's the only thing I'm good at
Took yo' bitch shopping, it was nothin' to that
Nah, I ain't gon' say that, nah, I ain't gon' do that
But the bitch you with, blew my muffin top blue back
Sit with thoughts like a toad on a stone
Try to put my finger in her like a rotary phone
If I take her for a spin, she would never call home
Put her hand behind her own head like Karl Malone

Spittin' on porches, rappin' for a mortgage
For a bowl of porridge I put you into orbit
My nigga did a bid, just got home with a rack
Last time he heard me spittin', he had a Nautica jacket
But he still packin'
God gave him a hat trick
When his ass got out, LeBron suddenly on the Mavericks
I was gon' stop ya, but when I heard this beat I started countin' up my car fare
The way I get product' and beats this good this shit is not fair
Sorta make you think but this ain't like a high chair

Let me change the channel with the pliers
Wet clothes on the porch, we ain't have a dryer
Spending food stamps, wait ’til ya leave the store
Too many in the bed, had to sleep on the floor
'Cause my cousin always pee, getting whipped in the morning
Every night can't sleep, got me tossing and turning
Late night in the kitchen, here I’m always fussin'
Got my ass beat, I ain't even do nothin'
Seen her crying in the kitchen and I don't know why
Caught my aunt smokin' crack and she got a black eye
Living on Focus: HOPE and we tryna get by
Sippin' on WIC juice, wash it down with chili fries
Homie shot at the Coney, hope he survive
Only go to church when someone die
Kids raisin' kids, all tryna be grown
Things never fix when we come from broken homes

We was young, black and poor being raised in Detroit (Raised in Detroit)

Surrounded by killers, couldn't see the big picture

Didn't know what was true, had nothing to lose
"Home where the heart is"? But where is the love?
Feeling lost in the world, they don't care about us
Back to the world, we ain't had no plan
Everything about the city made me who I am
You can make it here, yeah, yeah, you know the rest
Everyday was like a test, if you fail, it's death
Or a trip to Wayne county, hope you don't get sent to Jackson
Middleman taxin', to the story just a fraction
How the system made division but it don't add up?
Take away from the hood, never giving back to us

Who's that peeping in my window?
I don't really know what they here for
On the corner just built a Starbucks
I was just looking for a come up
Right there used to be a crack house
Now it's an organic garden

Tell me what to do when the block gets slow, and the money get low, but the rent rise up
White folks popping out the blue, they done tore that down and made that to a Whole Foods
Landlords looking for a payday
Now it's rental scooters where we used to sling yay

What the fuck I'm 'posed to do now?
All alone, now I'm feeling like a clown
Should've listen to my homie when he told me "slow down"
Caught up in the moment, head was stuck in the clouds
Lifestyle of this music shit
Had me on some stupid shit
Never would've thought I'd fuck up who I'm closest with
All my fault, for most of it
Thought I knew everything, but don't know shit
That's why I'm so sick
Lost in my emotions, the path that I chosen
Left a nigga broken, can't stay focused
Hard for me to think
Tryna kill my pain, so I drink
Whoever would've thought it would end this way?
Caught a couple times, but I thought we was straight
Got caught a couple times, but I thought we was straight

World fell apart ever since you left
Fucked up bad, now I blame myself

Rap a young man game, and ya missed ya mark
Probably never win a Grammy or chart on the charts
Should I still keep goin' or call it a day?
All night thinkin' 'bout dumb mistakes I made
Tell me where you're 'posed to go when it ain't fun no more
If you don't rap, you don't eat, and that's the way it go

You can never trust yourself when you're livin' a lie
Like a few of these rappers I know, always following trends
Never stick to the code
Back in the day, they sold their soul for Rock'n'Roll
But with this rap shit, a nigga sell his booty-hole
What you doing over there, we doing this over here
My aunt died, was on tour, couldn't shed no tears
Had to go, won't stay, so I'm turning the page
We can wish all we want, but this ain't back in the days

Never know when it's over cause this life won't last

Shit getting out of hand, tell me when will it stop

Done so much coke, it's like a gram on my booger, nigga
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, nigga, let her wake up
It's a million ways to get it, better make 'em pay up
