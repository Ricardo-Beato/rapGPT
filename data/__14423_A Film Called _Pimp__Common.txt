Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a Person In Making Profit
See, I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be travelin'
And Chevy windows be rattlin'
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asking her the name wasn't the way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin' on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried
You might also like
Motion denied (pause)
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god

(Hey girl, come on over here, check it out)
Make your next move your best move, choose me

How I look working for a nigga in a kufi?
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy

(Yeah, OK)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream
Nigga, you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me (Common: Get real now)
Pimp yo' punk ass, have you write me poetry
I'm from a lane called cash, you too slow for me

You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than baguettes, furs, and slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin' in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
(Common: Try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball?
I know pimpin' ain't easy but damn, you barely surviving
We can't ride together 'cause you ain't driving
(Common: Oh, it's like that)

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
(This, this, this really how I look at it, check it)
You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention

Think I'm gon' risk my ass then give you the cash (Common: Yep)
That shit is the past, I got my own stable (Common: Where at?)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract

Girl, you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right

(Is that right?)
I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Common: Say what?)
Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (Common: And pimp what?)
Pimp systems
Got stores called Big Pimpin' (Common: Where?)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house

(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou
(MC Lyte: Yeah right)
Bring 'em back to the States to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer

(HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Common: Why you laughin'?)
I'm laughin' 'cause you funny
I make bitch niggas like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki

Yo, whatever happened to loyalty?
Don't you want to become royalty?
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher


Well there you have it y'all
The story of pimps and hoes, y'all know how it goes
It's been the oldest profession
The whole thing is like a lesson
Ain't no second guessin'
Pimps y'all, hustlers
All that good shit
Yeah, yeah, 2000 and forever
It'll be here
Uh, uh aiight cool
