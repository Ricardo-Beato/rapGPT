I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh
I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh

I'm laughing at me, not with me
One hand to keep the other hand clean
The full moon looked like a tangerine
Fell out of the sky to land into the sea
But when I drifted up on that beach
Previous presidents got impeached
Then she put me on the longest leash
I feel like a new drug on these streets
And ain’t nobody in denial
I’ll eat your dinner off the kitchen tile
Never been afraid to go the extra mile
Just wanna see you flex your sexy smile
Woke up on the bottom of a fox nest
Top heavy like a cop's vest
But I gotta put it in the context
She's not an object, she's a bomb threat
You might also like
I never felt the world explode
Until it was too late, oh
You had me when you lost me then
I found I couldn't stay, oh
Sometimes you were around the hours
I wish you were away, oh
The things we want ignite in flames
Sit back and watch the parade, oh

It's just her and me and some cheap balloons
Turn the key and sing the tunes
The full moon looked like a macaroon
I feel invisible till the afternoon
But everybody wanna catch a star
To try to recharge that electric spark
Crash a car and set it in park
But she’ll smash his ceramic heart like a dead guitar
No spotlight not the type that needs vacancy to occupy
Gotta put that rabbit back into the magic act
Astronauts but they’ll launch your Cadillac
No stop light, no stop sign, no basis to apologize
Fight for that right to love, that’s what life is of
Look up high, you can see us fly above
I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh
I never had those finer things
Those finer things in life, oh
I never worry 'bout a thing
About a thing in life, oh2Embed
