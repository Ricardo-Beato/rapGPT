みなさんJay-Zのようになりたいよ
彼はすごいかっこいいけど、周り全然楽しんでないよ
Roc-A-Fella, y'all
It's the Roc
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
R-O, R-O-C, niggas, R-O
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
Hov, R-O-C, niggas, R-O, woo
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
It's Hov, R-O-C, niggas
(Jay-Z)

Come on the track like duh-duh-duh-duh
With a throwback jersey and a fitted
Might blow a bag of Hershey in the siddix
Or might take sips of Army with a chiddick, I'm so sick with it
Lampin' in the Hamptons
The weekends, man, the Stan Smith Adidas and the Campus
Or playin' guts on the cruise, Hermès boat shoes
The Izod bucket on, I'm so old-school
Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops
Six top model chicks, who is this hot?
J-A, ladies, help me say it now
Y-Z, mami, why you playin' with me?
Ride with me, get high as me
It's how it's supposed to be when you rollin' with G's, Hov
Back up in this bitch like woah
Jigga get this whole shit jumpin' like six-fours
You might also like
(Hov), V is I, and I am him
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all got love for me, I got love for y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all go to war for me, I go to war with y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)

Hov, and so I breeze through, jeans is Evisu
She's respondin', top is C. Ronson
We in Luan (Woo), gettin' our groove on
Buyin' out the bar, on our way to Spa'
She never seen a hundred on the wrist before
Never seen twenty-twos on the six before
I am killin' 'em out there, they needin' first aid
'Cause the boy got more sixes than first grade
The crib got killer views and square feet
You have to film MTV Cribs for a week
So sleep if you need to, mami, I will leave you
Right where you stand, nah, I don't wanna dance (I'm good)
I just wanna see what's in your Frankie B pants
Waist is low enough to let your waist show
Top like a rock star, I got a fast car
We can cruise the city doin' a buck-sixty
(Hov), V is I, and I am him
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all got love for me, I got love for y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all go to war for me, I go to war with y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)

He did it again, haters no like
But they gotta fuck with it, 'cause the flow's so tight
Gnarly, dude, I puff Bob Marley, dude
All day like Rastafaris do
Now I'm stuck to the point I could hardly move
You fuckin' up my high, don't bother me, dude
But Red Rover, send your hoes over
She can do whatever, sip somethin' with soda
She can leave whenever, sip somethin' with Hova
We can play however, slay bed or sofa
And the prognosis, sex is explosive
Left her with wet bedsheets, nigga, I'm focused

(Hov), V is I, and I am him
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
Slim with the tilted brim on twenty-inch rims
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all got love for me, I got love for y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga)
And if y'all go to war for me, I go to war with y'all
(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga), woah
R-O, R-O-C, niggas
R-O-C, niggas
(Roc-A-Fella, y'all)8Embed
