37 ContributorsSellin Dreams Lyrics
Welcome to Hell's paradise
I always heard life was a pair of dice
Seven, eleven, or a pair of eyes
As I'm lookin' at her smearin' eyes
She yellin', "Take them glasses off
Your eyes are the only thing that's not lyin'"
Not carin' to the point that I stopped lyin'
I tell her I feel the same
She tell me, "Nigga, quit playin'
You the only one that's not cryin'"
You said you wasn't on no steal your man shit
If I broke it off now, we won't be on some friend shit
Man, what goes around comes around, that ceilin' fan shit
I broke the levee to your eyes, that I don't give a damn shit

And time (Time) after time, it's the same old shit
Think it might be too late, for me to learn from my mistakes ('Akes)
And I know that it hurts (Oh), I know that it hurts you (Oh)
But you should have used your head first
This might be the biggest mistake, it's too late
'Cause two can't be in first place

Well, wake up then, shit
Call your ex and makeup then
What was no strings attached got tangled when
Fun stopped bein' fun, and feelings tried to finagle in
We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in
Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one
You need a good guy and I'm already not one
She said, "We lost a kid already, I'm already not that young
My biological clock is tickin', I'm not just tryna have fun"
Shit's way different from us first chillin'
Sometimes last words can have the worst endin'
Wish we could fast forward time and reverse feelings
Is there a warranty for love to return or fix it? (Hmm)
She said, "You good either way
When it was her last night, nigga, and me today
You the man, huh? Gettin' all the TNA
You fuckin' her raw too, sharin' our DNA?"
Huh, and so on and so on (Hmm)
And the shit just always goes on
Nothin' about us feelin' right
But she'll be back before the end of the night, sayin'
You might also like
Oh, and time (Time) after time (Time, time), it's the same old shit (Same old shit, yeah)
Think it might be too late (Oh, no), for me to learn from my mistakes ('Akes)
And I know that it hurts (Oh), I know that it hurts you (Oh)
But you should have used your head first
This might be the biggest mistake, it's too late
'Cause two can't be in first place

I love, I love her2Embed
