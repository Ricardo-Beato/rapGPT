52 ContributorsBirds & Bees Lyrics
Birds and the bees, they wannabes, they'll never fuck with me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes, they'll never fuck with me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes, they'll never fuck with me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes, they'll never fuck with me

Rounds up in that chamber, I'm a gangsta like my daddy
My mama caused another problem when she had me
They found another dead body in the alley
They found another dead body in the alleyway
Stacking paper, I'm a gangsta like my granny
It's money over everything if you ask me
They found another dead body in the alley
They found another dead body in the alleyway
I'm "stop-and-pop"-ing like a shooting guard
My seat is back, I'm too relaxed, not moving out this car
I shot your child, so what? You know we wilding after dark
The sun come down and guns come out, you know Ramona Park
Bandana brown, my skin is brown, I'm fighting with the law
We running 'round the city, east, west and the north
G check, better leap if you feeling frog
You with the shit, get your feet wet with the sharks
You might also like
Not a choice
In my world
Choose to fly or fall
Oh
So if you fall
In my world
Choose to fly or
Fall

Birds and the bees, they wannabes, they'll never fuck with me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes, they'll never fuck with me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes, they'll never fuck with me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes, they'll never fuck with me

Rounds up in that chamber, I'm a gangsta like my daddy11Embed
