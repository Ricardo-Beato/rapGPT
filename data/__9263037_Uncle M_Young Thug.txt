(Metro)
Ya dig?

I'ma bailer, same way I own the mailer
Own the smell up, cooked the— uh, he tried to sell us
You can pick up couple grand and a fill up
Peel the top back, we don' need no fuckin' peeler
Uncle Murda, you can still get turned up
In suburbans, came in six levels up
I'ma flush, yellow Xanny school bus
On a island, damn near spent a million plus

This some big dawg shit, get your levels up (Bitch)
Last time I seen the slut, she had started nuttin' (Shit, shit)
I had got her to her worst, we was all in public (Right)
She don't gotta do nothin' first, 'cause he out your budget (Gotta)
White bad shit, lookin' like a fuckin' napkin (Uh-huh)
Wе been clappin' (Let's go), shit, that's why we always absent (Woo)
Undеrstandin', Phantom Rolls-Royce, it's backwards (Yeah, yeah)
They respect us (Yeah), honeycomb AP bezel (Woo)
I'm just mad 'cause (Uh-huh), the cameras on the front and back of us (Woo)
They stay gassed up (Yeah, yeah), they don't know when it's time to mash for us (Woo)
She cummin' fast up there (Uh-huh), I don't know when it's time to care for her (Woo)
Smokin' a vegetable, I just been choppin' and fuckin' up vegetables (Woo)
