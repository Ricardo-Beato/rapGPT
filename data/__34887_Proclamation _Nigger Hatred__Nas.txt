The white power structure of today is just as much interested in perpetuating slavery
As the white power structure was 100 years ago
Only now they use modern methods of doing so
And, uhâ€¦

White folks made up nigga and don't want me to say it
Ain't that a bitch?
You made it up, you shouldn't have made it up!
You done fucked up, you shouldn't have made up nigga
And you made up a song to go with it
Please don't make me sing the song
Eenie meenie minie
You know the god damn song I'm talking about
And you change the words when you see black folks

This is my opening scripture - I've been preparing this album
My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satan's bombarding me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not Bathing Apes
But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty
This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defending Vick, and free that nigga T.I.P
I'd take the grave or a bid
Then let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's going to church
Plants packs on the man that's going to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruiting all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar a racist
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga hatredYou might also like1Embed
