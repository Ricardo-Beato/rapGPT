83 ContributorsJust How It Is Lyrics
Wheezy outta here

Ooh-woo, diamonds peek-a-boo
Ooh-woo, I done fucked her crew
Ooh-woo, I done did the robbin'
I done did the jackin', now I'm full rappin'
I put on my brothers, I put on my bitch
Had to wear the dress 'cause I had a stick
You know where the bag at, tell me where it is
I came from rags to riches, I'm the shit
I can no longer disguise it, bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I got cars galore, lil' bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I escaped every one of the licks 'cause I was supposed to be rich
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is

Put it in a Uber, send it to a shooter
Ask me how they do it, kickin' shit, Ryu, Ken
Put it in a cab, send it to a Arab
Hit 'em with the MAC now, now his whole body scabbed
Cash on delivery (Ayy)
G.O.A.T. talk of the century (Oh)
No time for gibberish, all the critics hearin' this
All the bitches lipstick, and her pussy slippery
I can call a troop, go by the name of Duke
Kidnap a kangaroo, I can send a moose (Woo)
Niggas stole a chain, but I ain't worried, fool
I'ma keep on spinnin' 'til they tell me who
You might also like
Ooh-woo, diamonds peek-a-boo
Ooh-woo, I done fucked her crew
Ooh-woo, I done did the robbin'
I done did the jackin', now I'm full rappin'
I put on my brothers, I put on my bitch
Had to wear the dress 'cause I had a stick
You know where the bag at, tell me where it is
I came from rags to riches, I'm the shit
I can no longer disguise it, bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I got cars galore, lil' bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I escaped every one of the licks 'cause I was supposed to be rich
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is

I don't gotta throw you shit like Kaepernick, nah
I got seven bitches with me, Kaepernick
Yeah, R.I.P. Nipsey, I can tell you how to get rich
I can tell you how to die or how to live in this bitch
I can tell you how to talk the most impeccable shit
I can show you how to walk like you got decimals, bitch
Show you how I can get the top from all the top ten bitches
I got white Adderalls and I have amoxicillin
I got lights on, baby, I got moths in this bitch
No fly zone, caught you like you're Moss in this bitch
Growin' tycoon and I took some losses, you bitch
I'm a boss, but I don't like to take a loss in this bitch (Wheezy outta here)
Such a player but I cake and cuddle all of my bitches
I got layers, I got millions, I got all type of buildings
Fuck around and air the pussy nigga out like linen
Last nigga tried me almost got popped in Lenox
Ask the cops, ask the detectives, they know all the business
Ask the cops and the detectives, all the jurisdictions
Ask the kids at school who ambition all the missions
Gave the lawyer close to two mil', he handle all the killings
I don't know and I don't wanna know who 'flaged Bentleys
I don't know what's goin' with bro, I think they all spillin'
We don't speak 'bout shit on wax, it's all mob business
We known to kill the biggest cats of all kitties
Ooh-woo, diamonds peek-a-boo
Ooh-woo, I done fucked her crew
Ooh-woo, I done did the robbin'
I done did the jackin', now I'm full rappin'
I put on my brothers, I put on my bitch
Had to wear the dress 'cause I had a stick
You know where the bag at, tell me where it is
I came from rags to riches, I'm the shit
I can no longer disguise it, bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I got cars galore, lil' bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I escaped every one of the licks 'cause I was supposed to be rich
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is8Embed
