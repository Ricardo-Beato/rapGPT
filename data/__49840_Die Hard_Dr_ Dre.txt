31 ContributorsDie Hard Lyrics
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight

My life is like a highlight reel
Some might consider this my twilight but depending how I might feel
I might continue on with my career for 5 light years
Critics can fly kites here?
Welcome to my nightmare
Pressures on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step, pacin’
Don’t know if I’ll meet expectations
All I know is the World better get set
Dre’s in effect
Been in it since you had cassette decks taping
I’m sick

I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight

It’s on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations
They're soaring too high to meet, my reputations in jep’
Yep, face it, the fans they’ve been upset yet patient, I love ‘em for that

I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going 'cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight8Embed
