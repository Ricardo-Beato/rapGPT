5 ContributorsBlack Is Back Lyrics
Full blown, rap, rock and roll
Whatever happened to solid gold?
Ain't like it can't and won't get sold
Sold by the same cats that stole your soul
Back on a track, don't sound too old
What's goin' on? I don't know, it's trouble
Back in black to bust that bubble
Black Superman's back and not Daredevil
Don't wear throwbacks cause I'm a throwback
So I threw that throwback on the racks
So let's go back, just way on back
Before 8 tracks and Cadillacs
Cats still on crack, screamin' what they lack
And it started with your baby on Similac
Don't get me started, get it up to speed
Gettin' back your soul is what you need

{scratches} Black is back

Get on the soul train, get your soul drained
If your soul's drained, backed right to your brain
Keep the peoples away from P.E. the peeps
So the top 10 joints kill 'em all asleep
So what they got, you think is hot
But the real things in life, your soul forgot
Don't hear it on the radio or MTV
I damn don't know about BET
You might also like

If we can't reach 'em, damn can't teach 'em
Somebody hatin' cause we got the information
Do this once a moon like an eclipse
So back to them politics off my lips
Tell the scared beware of them ghetto tricks
Tell the government, please stay off my dick
The Cris whatever I never sip
Keep the whole damn bottle, I don't even trip
