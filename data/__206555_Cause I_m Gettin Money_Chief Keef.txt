25 ContributorsCause Iâ€™m Gettin Money Lyrics
Holiday

I smell like I got a 100 pounds of blocks on me
It's reekin' out the car, homie
She wanna freak 'cause I'm a star, low-key
Tell me what bitch do not know me
I'ma blow this .30 like Odee
Leanin' off this A-C-T, I OD'd
Can't trust a face, feel niggas plottin' on me
And it's all because I'm gettin' money (808Mafia)

Got that bitch off the drugs, she a zombie
She wanna fuck with us, we get money
Bitch, is you drunk, you want my Beamer car keys?
Let's see if they got Beamer taxis
Just bought Kay Kay a Beamer car seat
My boys gon' spray, let us see a opp please
I'm Sunny and you niggas coffee
But now that is my favorite mafi (808Mafia)
Bitch, I ain't with that lovie-dovie
Bitch, you just gotta suck and fuck me
Got a pound of that Earth, it's lovely
Now I'm sparkin' up, climbin' up trees
While I'm smokin' on this dope, this bitch keep callin' my phone
Don't you see I'm gettin' high? Bitch, just leave me alone
I see niggas feelings hurt, tell Chief Sosa what's wrong
Bustin' like a Dillinger, got my dumb ass pulled over (808Mafia)

I smell like I got a 100 pounds of blocks on me
It's reekin' out the car, homie
She wanna freak 'cause I'm a star, low-key
Tell me what bitch do not know me
I'ma blow this .30 like Odee
Leanin' off this A-C-T, I OD'd
Can't trust a face, feel niggas plottin' on me
And it's all because I'm gettin' money (808Mafia)Embed
