8 ContributorsShe Love It Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah
Baby don't stop what you're doing
Yeah
Baby don't stop what you're doing
I Like that right there
Yeah
Let's get it
Baby don't stop what you're doing
Check

Shorty got a ass but she playing hard to get
Poured a cup of Goose, then took a couple sips
Rolled up the purple, then I took a couple hits
Asking about Nick Speed, she was all on my dick
Crooks tee, Air Max from overseas
True Religions bluer than the oceans in the sea
I'm just trying to get up in them Juicy jogging pants
Wash your toe rings and send home to you're man
I can do things that you wish he can
Let me hold your legs while you do a handstand
Shorty let me taste that applesauce
Have you grabbing sheets saying "oh my god"
Climb the wall, scratch my back
You might also like
Bet

You didn't know I could do it like that
Bet
You didn't know you could come like that
Got her mind gone and she keep coming back
Said she want it hard, said she want it fast
Said she love it when I'm smacking on her ass
Said she love it here, said she want it there
Said she love it when I'm pulling on her hair
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
You know I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
Only if you want it
You know I really want it

Ooh baby, you're turning me on
I'll let you get behind and rub it while they playing my song
You know i like it like that
Oh you like it like that
You know I want it like that
Oh you want it like that
Ooh girl I wanna touch you make your shoes curl
Bend you over, lick your  girl
Sip that good wine and make the room swirl
Your ass out of control
So move girl, till the sun up, sun up
Switch your hairdo out when its done up, done up
So sexy when you dance and you like your ass smacked
Nasty girl want to get it all up in that clap trap
Plus I do all that wild shit you like
Make them bust every time, ain't nothing different tonight
I want to push all your buttons
You gotta be the shit
When your tush starts to  and slide on it's  it's busting out the most
Jelly shaker, remind me of the sandwich toast
Give them a piece of the juicy fruit and niggas brag and boast
Feel what I'm working with baby
 make you feel
