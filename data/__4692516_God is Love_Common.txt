16 ContributorsGod is Love Lyrics
The unconditional, critical mission, listen to
The indivisible, mystical, it was meant for you
And meant for me, infinitely
Even been to prisons to visit you
Ask, "What would Christians do?"
Well some are harassing Native Americans
If God is love, why is hate in the air again?
Search for Samaritans in the hood, misunderstood
A savior comes, will he only come for the good?
The lost tribe of Shabazz and the second class
God, I see you in the streets where the checks is cashed
Hear you in the heartbeat, hopin' that love'll last
I know you in the words, "Where the first is last"
They try to use math to quantify you
In 2005, you saved lives by the Bayou
I know you in the mouth of the spouse singing, "I do"
The most vital is how I describe you

Even when the hard times come
I'll be standing in your love
Grateful, grateful for this life
You turned on the light (Hey, hey)
Even when the hard times come
I'll be standing in your love
Grateful, grateful for this life
You turned on the light

We were Buffalo Soldiers, dreadlocked Rastas
Praying to Jehovah, Rafa, in the back of cop cars
Even then we knew that love was not far
It's in the passion of the teachers and the rockstars
The muslim sisters singing "allƒÅhu akbar"
It's coming from where Maya and Pop are
It's in the grandchild's stare up at Papa
"Love is love" became the mantra
The montage for creation, we need it in relation
When two ships pass, one love is the flotation
It's what God used to put the planet in rotation
It's what the culture used to build a hip hop nation
From the basement to the attic, where cookie show for magic
It's what we told the world when we said our lives matter
Turn the student to a master, hustler to a pastor
That's why I'm a rapper, it's all that I'm after

Even when the hard times come
Yeah I know that
I'll be standing in your love (Yeah)
Oh, that's why I am
Grateful, (So) grateful for this life
You turned on the light (Hey, hey)
God your love has taught me that
Even when the hard times come
Oh, I know that I'll
I'll be standing in your love (Hey, and I am)
Grateful, grateful for this life (Grateful)
You turned on the light
You turned on the light, yes you did
When it's hard (Yeah)
I know you're right there
Tell me where would I be?
Placed it all
Without your love
At your feet
Where would I be?
I don't know
Without your light
What tomorrow brings
Tell me where would I be?
Without your grace
What I know is
I am so grateful, I am so grateful
Oh oh, oh I know (Oh-oh)
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
'Cause you are the light
