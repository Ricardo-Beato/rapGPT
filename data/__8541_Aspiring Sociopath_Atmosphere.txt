24 ContributorsAspiring Sociopath Lyrics
No wait, a tea, make it a good green tea

7:30 AM, alerted to life by a song on the radio
The evening is over
Another morning, another opportunity
To do something progressive, to prove that he's worthy
Up and out the door by 9 O'clock
The sun is shining up and down the block
This children in the corner, waiting for a bus
That will take them to school and exploit their trust
He starts the car, sparks with one crank
It's those good ol' fashioned American mechanics
And even though he'd rather own a new import
It's dependable and more important, it's all he can afford
Stops by the coffee shop to pick up some smokes, and a cup of Joe
(No, wait make it a tea, a good green tea)
Back into the Ford with the windows rolled up
So when the radio rocks, he can sing along freely
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
At the top of his lungs, the words burst through shameless
Pushing that dream, trying to beat the time
Oh well, whatever, nevermind
Nothing else matters when you're knifing through traffic
Wishing it was a stick shift, it's an automatic
Listening to the road, voice of the nomad
How he'd love to leave, drive away never go back
Wheels keep on turning, turning, turning and turning
Alone is when he finally feels like a person
Light another Nat Sherman
Crack the window, feel the wind blow
Serenity tenfold
God bless whoever invented sunglasses
And while you're at save the saints that work the fast food drive-thrus
Objects are closer than they appear
Cause when you're by yourself there ain't one else to lie to
Talk radio gets a lot of play in his vehicle
It teaches him topics to discuss with real people
So, when he stops to get gas or hit that coffee shop
His neurotic ass can act like he knows a whole lot
Pour some sugar on me, my counterfeit personality
He's a loner Dottie, he's a rebel
He's gonna drive the escort to the middle of that meadow
Thinking about how he could leave this city
Fill the tank and towards the water, he'll flee
Maybe he should just go get a pitcher at the CC
Find a stool at the bar where he can stare at the TV
Either way, tomorrow will be just like today
And that's all it takes to make the change
He loves to drive more than he loves being alive
And this town doesn't even know his real name
You might also like
It goes bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove the Ford to the border, to disturb the order
If only that he'd know that, he wouldn't be missed
Maybe then he could have grown to exist1Embed
