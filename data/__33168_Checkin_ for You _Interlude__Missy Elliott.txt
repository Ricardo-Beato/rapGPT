5 ContributorsCheckinâ€™ for You (Interlude) Lyrics
See, it's two type of bitches in the world
You got a broke bitch, you got a rich bitch
That would explain what I am and what my girl Missy is
We the rich motherfuckin' bi-o-tches!
That's right
And then you got a bitch like me
Who just stand above all bitches
That excludes my girl Missy, Mary
You know what I'm saying?
But ya'll know what the fuck I mean, heh
I'm the Queen Bitch, that's right motherfucker, what?
Ya'll gotta problem wit' it, come see me
A motherfucker ain't taking my title
Or my girl Missy title, or my girl Mary title
What, that's right
See, only bitches like us is allowed to play a game a chess
You see, a real queen needs a king
You damn motherfuckin' right
I don't want no nigga laying up under me
That I can't do for me what I can't do for my motherfuckin' self
So when ya'll see me in the street
This is what I want ya'll to do:
Fix your lips, put 'em together nicely and say
Say it along, say it along now
Say "She's a bitch!"

I was walkin' real slow to the dance floor (Say what?)
He was lookin' at my ass and I turned him on
I see him talkin' to his boy on his cellular phone
I looked at him and all he could say was
"Damn, baby, bring it on"
I talk shit, but I come though like a storm (Say what?)
I keep my piece so sweet, yeah, nice and warm
And all he could feel was this "Love, baby"

I don't give a fuck about what they think, what they say
They can call me a freak, call me anything they wanna name
I don't give a, I don't give a
I just wanna take him home
Take him to the house, then turn him out
He ain't checkin' for you
I don't give a fuck about what they think, what they say
They can call me a freak, call me anything they wanna name
I don't give a, I don't give a
I just wanna take him home
Take him to the house, then turn him out
He ain't checkin' for youEmbed
