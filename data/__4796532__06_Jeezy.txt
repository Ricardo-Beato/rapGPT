9 Contributorsâ€™06 Lyrics
Let that shit rock for a minute, nigga
It's 104, nigga
It's gangster shit, nigga

We keep them thangs cocked (Yeah)
We hit and we don't miss (Don't miss)
Check out this bad bitch (Yeah)
We fuck but we don't kiss (Don't kiss)
Watch is a plain Jane (Yeah)
Cost me like 4 bricks (Yeah)
Just seen your first mill (Ayy)
Spent that in '06 (Yeah)
We keep them thangs cocked (Yeah)
We hit and we don't miss (Don't miss)
Check out this bad bitch (Yeah)
We fuck but we don't kiss (Don't kiss)
Watch is a plain Jane (Yeah)
Cost me like 4 bricks (Yeah)
Just seen your first mill (Let's go)
Spent that in '06 (Let's go)

Picture me rolling, nigga, like Pac in the '90s, ho (90's, ho)
Knocked off that 50 pack, told 'em send me 'bout 90 more (Yeah)
Already famous, I was a star at the corner store (Yeah)
Just holler at shawty, one twenty-five for a quarter O (Haha)
Jeezy for president, make America snow again (Yeah)
Make America snow again (Snow)
Hurt us in '05, yeah there go that blow again (Damn)
Cuzzo just touched down, I cast him out on a truck (Truck)
My cousin set up my cousin, that's what you call bad luck (Yeah, you already know what this is)

Spent that in '06 (Let's go, Mayback Music)

Soldiers of fortune, you niggas giggle with groupies (Huh)
I sold my soul for two Porsches so niggas kill me or sue me (Boss)
Smorgasbord full of bitches, nose candy delicious
Pocket silk, turtle necks (Woo), Rolls Royce repetitious
I'm chasing money relentless, massive wealth what you call it
Crime scene at your party, young nigga dearly departed
Gave a stack to my barber, bitches loving my beard
Make her get so erotic, I think she feeling sincere (Maybach Music)
We keep them thangs cocked (Yeah)
We hit and we don't miss (Don't miss)
Check out this bad bitch (Yeah)
We fuck but we don't kiss (Don't kiss)
Watch is a plain Jane (Yeah)
Cost me like 4 bricks (Yeah)
Just seen your first mill (Ayy)
Spent that in '06 (Yeah)
We keep them thangs cocked (Yeah)
We hit and we don't miss (Don't miss)
Check out this bad bitch (Yeah)
We fuck but we don't kiss (Don't kiss)
Watch is a plain Jane (Yeah)
Cost me like 4 bricks (Yeah)
Just seen your first mill (Let's go)
Spent that in '06 (Let's go)Embed
