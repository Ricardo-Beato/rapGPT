I'm not really supposed to talk about this
But-
But-
But-
But-
But-

Try not to make a huge deal out of nothing now
Levitation look too real let me touch the ground
The way I feel don't define me I'm just shutting down
Ain't enough minutes in your life for you to fuck around
Thought that you was ready for the world but you don't love me down
Celebration of participation never struck 'em out
There's something 'bout the way we run our mouth in DoubleTown
But you the one that called the cops to come and cut the sound

Everybody knows somebody (Rooftop party)
But nobody knows anybody (Rooftop party)
But everybody knows somebody (Rooftop party)
But nobody knows anybody (Rooftop party)
Everybody knows somebody (Rooftop party)
But nobody knows anybody (Rooftop party)
But everybody knows somebody (Rooftop party)
But nobody knows anybodyYou might also like1Embed
