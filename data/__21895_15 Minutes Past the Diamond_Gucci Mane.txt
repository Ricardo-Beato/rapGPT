5 Contributors15 Minutes Past the Diamond Lyrics
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane geah
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane uhh
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane {*2X*}
So Icy E-N-T {*3X*}
It's the kid {*2X*}
It's the kid again {*echoes*}

Shawty asked me what time it is?
I said it's fifteen minutes past the diamonds bitch
An Laflare, in the cockpit, Gucci the prophet
I Met Her Ass shoppin, West coast hoppin

Gucci~! Niggas get Boxed In I get Cochran
Now ask Josh Avanta{?} or Egalin{?}
Lawyers, doctors, and policemen
Jewelers, Mueller, Jacob, Breitlin
My hood life Thunder the verse like lightning
My flow so frightening, it not nothin nice man
See I shoot bul-lets and you shoot dice man
It's my life man, so Im Ray Right Man
See I'm no red man, and I'm no white man
I don't Be Countin my Aston Martin
My chain be shinin, my grill be sparklin
It's Gucci darlin, now whassup shawty?
You might also like

Shawty so sexy but she be flexin
Oh he ride Lexus, ooh I fly frequent
Oh he pop bottles, then I'm not drinkin
Oh that smell stinkin, what I'm just thinkin
Its Cold outside why didn't you Mink it?
Oh boo you left it, so bitch I bet ya
Fifty dollar ring with a four dollar outfit
Talkin 'bout your man tell him why you a trick bitch
On to the next one, shawty the best one
From Houston, Texas, damn she vibrant
Crushin, blushin, I got her Ass smilin
The sunburnt eyelids, but I'm not whylin
I'm admirin, she perspirin
The way she dancin, has got me risin
Let's go kick it, let's go shoppin
Tear the mall up girl I'm not poppin


It's Gucci baby, it's +groovy baby+
The Maybach mango, the inside gravy
My wrist game crazy, His Necc Piece Hazy
My 180, Your Chain Fugazi
The black Slim shady, I know they hate me
Ya Wife Want date me, but you won't Let Her
Cuz you know better, cause you gon' save her
I know you Pay her, Damn That Lame Boiii
But that's not playa, and that's not gangsta
My fingers got The Paper Cuts But I'm no banka
See I'm Ah Thinka, Straight Up Ship SInka
So Icy Entertainment we cuttin off Fangaz
