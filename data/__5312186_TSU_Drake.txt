Yeah, we back
What's up, ladies?
Swishahouse, baby
What's up to all the ladies on the north side, south side, east side, west side?
What's up in Bay City?
What's up to all the ladies in Louisiana?
What's up to all the ladies in Dallas, Austin, San Antonio?
Marshall, Prairie View, it's going down
Wharton County, Texas City, H-Town, baby
TSU ladies

She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit
Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

I'ma just give it to you direct, instead of me throwin' this shit
You know you important and shit
You know I'm supportin' this shit
We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit
I got like four on the wrist and an adorable kid
I got a Drac' in the studio, and I don't just mean that I'm in this bitch
Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head
And then you go glow up a bit

Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

Her daddy is not around, mama is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight

She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business

Black boxes with the bow and rose
Zara heels bound to give ya Zara toes
Back that thing up, it's a wide load, shawty
I don't even know where the time goes, shawty
Know you got some brand new life goals
Baby blue, but you are not a baby, I know, shawty
I know, yeah
So, why you gotta be so hard-headed?
Why you wanna ask? Girl, you know what I did
Actin' like you don't  already know what that is
Baby, just relax, I'm on your side
I will not discuss it with nobody
Neither of our pasts 'bout to go away
You made me forget about it anyway
I know, I know
Black boxes with the bow and rose
Little side hustle with the Fashion Nova
Know we both came from a broken home, shawty
Mom and daddy didn't really get along, shawty
Heard you got some brand new life goals
Baby blue, but you are not a baby, I know, shawty
I know, know, know, know, know37Embed
