8 ContributorsHuman Chandelier Lyrics
Huh, D-O-G
Wow, wow, wow, wow, Wop
Yeah, huh, go, go

Is it a crime to be full of yourself? 'Cause I'm gettin' cocky as hell
Ain't got time to be goin' to jail but I been feelin' myself
For three months they say Gucci canceled, I'll be rockin' Chanel
Know you heard 'bout my rep, I got murders on my belt
Black and green Moncler ring, call that bitch the Boston Celts
Sent a fiend to rehab but that shit didn't even help
Tell the haters when they see me, "Look, but do not make no step"
Slidin' through Charlotte in my Spider, man, I think I left a web
Dope jumping like Spud Webb, tell a hater go to hell
I'ma send a ting through the mail and drive the money in myself
Early teens, East Atlanta, we was broke, we jumped the rail
On my dick, had to ante up, pitch in to pay for bail (It's Gucci)

Water like a whale, cold as a polar bear
The human chandelier, coldest nigga ever lived
Diamonds in my ear, I look in the mirror
What you lookin' at? The coldest nigga ever lived

Brand new truck, it's yellow, and it came with an umbrella
Shawty got a bod' but she's a known woodpecker, 'pecker
Crowd full of folks, Coachella, 'chella
Mob hit like Costello, 'stello
Wise guy like Goodfella (Fella)
She wanna suck me up, I let her, let her
Beat her from the back, it's better, better
Told her hit back, she better, better
Gucci Mane got forever cheddar
Save a bitch, I never ever
Grippin' on her head, I pet her
Took her out to eat, I fed her
Knew she was a freak when I met her, met her
Fly ass and I jet her, jet her
She drink it all up like kettle
Dick rock hard, it's metal, metal
Head so good, got a medal, medal
Bad bitch, I'ma go get her, get her
Broke hoes hate, they bitter, bitter
I'ma leave money for the sitter, sitter
I'ma keep rollin', they quitters, quitters
They gon' keep trolling on Twitter, Twitters

Water like a whale, cold as a polar bear
The human chandelier, coldest nigga ever lived
Diamonds in my ear, I look in the mirror
What you lookin' at? The coldest nigga ever lived
Water like a whale, cold as a polar bear
The human chandelier, coldest nigga ever lived
Diamonds in my ear, I look in the mirror
What you lookin' at? The coldest nigga ever livedEmbed
