Alright, catch this real quick
Oh I, oh I

Baby, why you acting funny towards me?
Baby, I just need some company, company, company
Baby, I just need some company, company, company

You wanna go on a vacay
But you don't ask enough
You just be getting mad as fuck
I give her dick when she acting up
Baby, you should let me hold you
Let me be the one to, give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection
I love your imperfections
You are my selection, on God

Baby, I just need some company, company, company
Baby, I just need some company, company, company
Baby, I just need some company, company, company
Baby, I just need some company, company, companyYou might also like9Embed
