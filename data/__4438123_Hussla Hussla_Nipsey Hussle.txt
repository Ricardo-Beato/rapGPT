Let's get in that Slauson Boy shit
I know you feelin' a new movement on the West, baby, let's go
Yeah, it's one of them Slauson Boy hits
Y'all already know what it is
Ayy, Nip', you know that I'm sayin'?
Neighborhood, Nip' Hussle, H60dsta Rob in this motherfucker
Ayy, Rob, ayy my nigga, I think they want somethin' to bang to
I think they want somethin' to ride to, my nigga (Yeah)
You know, that get right music, huh? (Yeah)
It's only right, homie
Ayy, you gon' go first or I'ma go first?
Alright, holler at these niggas, yeah

I'm a hustler, hustler, baby, what it do?
Yeah, I always pop tags, yeah, I'm always brand new
Maybachs that's burnt blue, honey water for shoes
Women holler for dude, they sayin' he's the most improved
What, they mad, because he been in, must've thought I would lose
Thought the ho wouldn't choose my pimp, probably stayed on cruise
Now what I'm lookin' like not ballin' here, plenty broads callin' here
Niggas rentin' space for some months, they pay us all year
Let's get this clear here; I don't fear nobody
Especially if he soundin' body (Shh), better ask somebody
Slauson Boys, we run the party, bottles here for everybody
Crenshaw, Crenshaw, yeah, yeah, homie

Keep my neck and wrist shinin' and my diamonds see through
It ain't trickin' if you got it but that's not what we do (Nah)
Flip the game and get a dollar out a bitch just like you (Yeah)
Wanna sit inside coupes, wanna sip on my Veuv
VIP, you starstruck, tryna get inside too
Other niggas tried to, just to slip and slide through
But that feelin' you provide 'em have them tryin' to wife you
I know you've been lied to but he don't wear my size shoe
