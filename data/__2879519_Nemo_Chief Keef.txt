I tell my niggas, find Nemo
Find Nemo, find Nemo
I tell my niggas, find Lil Gay
Find Kemo, and find Nemo
When we see ya, Terentino
Pistols be Terentino
Who I trust? Me, Al Pacino
Come through clapping out a Venom

Come through busting out the trap like what to the fuck, buck to the buck, cut to the cut
Gun short, it'll smoke a nigga like a duck like dududuh, hop in my truck
Caught a nigga lacking, caught him by the bleechers
Left under bleechers, But I didn't see nothing
I'mma shoot gat E-US cause it's me and Nina and Reefer
Leave a nigga in the ER, car faster than a Cheetah
Come to your block, me and two Glocks, rockin' ya porch and leave ya
I ain't turnt up, I'm T'd up, take the bail for us and peed up
Got ugly ass throw away guns, and some cute ass keepers
I told my boys to getcha, boy, don't get got, come up in your kitchen, shooting up your pots
Shooting up your dishes with some guns with knives
Lookin' for ya nigga, where ya at? Sneak dissin' where ya snunners at?
I'm king Mufasa, but I ain't no Simba yet but I got KayKay, that's my little princess
Gave my nigga a golden spoon, like, could you cook with that?
I'm coolin' with my young niggas, don't start up, then it's done with ya
Blackgate come through shootin' up cars nigga, 3Hunna come shootin' up Mars nigga

I tell my niggas, find Nemo
Find Nemo, find Nemo
I tell my niggas, find Lil Gay
Find Kemo, and find Nemo
When we see ya, Terentino
Pistols be Terentino
Who I trust? Me, Al Pacino
Come through clapping out a VenomEmbed
