4 ContributorsCan’t Take It Lyrics
Uh, yeah

You ever have a love for something and it's taken away?
Tryin' so hard to forget all of the pain and mistakes
Don't know how much fuckin' stress that my brain can it take
On top forever 'cause I'm so afraid of fadin’ away
This music shit my love and passion
That's why I fell in love with rappin’
God forbid something happens, y'all still have my rhymes
Even though y’all didn't fuckin’ listen half the time
Got my reason, comeback season, dawg, I had to grind
I mean this shit is not a hobby, waitin’ out hours in the lobby
Ain’t no labels tryna sign me, but I’m flowin' like tsunamis
Through the struggles through the grimy, I’ma make it out
Couple years, there's no debate that I’m the greatest out
Better yet, just admit it now
Split the reel and switch the style
Niggas pay attention now, nobody is ill around
And when I say that "Nobody fuckin’ hot as me"
I’m not even being cocky, that's just honesty

All I wanna do is chase my dream
Gotta make it, everybody’s fuckin’ hatin’ me, oh
I can’t take it, oh no, I can’t take it
I can’t take it, well, no, I can’t take it
It’s crazy that I can’t trust my friends
Let me know when the lust will end
‘Cause it’s killin’ me
I can’t take it, well, no, I can’t take it
I can’t take it, I know I can’t take it
You might also like
Anything I spit was nothing but fact
Can’t say the same for other niggas who be frontin’ in wax
Takin’ pictures up on Twitter and they stuntin’ with straps
Overall, cause overhaul ‘cause they suck and they whack
And stress have you fuckin’ jumpin' off the floor and the wall
I’m tryna holla at my pops but he ignore my calls
Got me thinking like, damn man my father is trippin'
Momma got paper but spend it all on college tuition
So my first day of class I’m screamin', “Fuck the professor”
What this nigga gotta say for 30k a semester
Grandma claimin’ that you always gotta pray to get better
Can’t believe it when my niggas gettin’ sprayed with Berettas
And meanwhile the school's collectin’ they fuckin’ checks
We get a fancy sheet of paper with a bunch of debt
Man, that don’t sound right
Its like your fuckin’ whack ass music, it just don’t sound right
The beats with the sound like…

All I wanna do is chase my dream
Gotta make it, everybody’s fuckin’ hatin’ me, oh
I can’t take it, oh no, I can’t take it
I can’t take it, well, no, I can’t take it
It’s crazy that I can’t trust my friends
Let me know when the lust will end
‘Cause it’s killin’ me
I can’t take it, well, no, I can’t take it
I can’t take it, I know I can’t take it
And what you need
And what you need
And what you need
And what you are
What you are
What you are
What you are1Embed
