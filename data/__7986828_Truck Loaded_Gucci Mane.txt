3 ContributorsTruck Loaded Lyrics
Chyeah, chyeah, yeah, yeah
Uhh, uhh, wow, wow, phew, phew
Zay, yeah, yeah, burr, burr, burr

18 bands, I done sold another thang (Yeah)
10 grand cash, that'll get ya bout a half (Yeah)
3 point 5 that's a hundred dollar slab (Phew phew)
13 hundred for a baby, pussy nigga do the math
Tractor-trailer truck and it's full of that mid (Wow)
Caravan baby and it's loaded down with bricks (Wow)
Got a tractor-trailer truck and it's full of that mid (Wow, phew phew)
Got a caravan baby and it's loaded down with bricks, uh

Kilos stacked up, thirty's on my lack-truck
Re-up half a mil, pills, I'ma vacuum seal
Gucci, Truly, life of my movie
Woke up this morning bought an 08 dually
07 Charger SRT bitch
Sittin' on Ashanti's, trunk just beatin'
Dubs just breathin', old folks peekin'
Somebody bitch gettin' fucked this evening
Gucci got clugs, that's the slang in Cleveland
I'm so gangsta, he so corny
I'm so hood that ya bitch got horny
Cookin' up a brick 7:30 in thе morning (It's Gucci)

My vette burgandy, Hummer snow white
And I bought 'em same day, true story real light
See my right wrist ice me out like a bitch
I got so much money, I can ice my clique
Put ice on the bitch, put ice on my fists
See them diamonds on my rims, that's some million dollar slims
I'm a cocaine chef, and I love myself
Waitin' on Gucci to fall off, better hold your breathe
'Cause the donk look clear, Malibu look stealth
Got so much money I'ma ice my belt
See my donk look clear, Malibu look stealth
Got so much money, I'ma ice my belt (Gucci)

Got a caravan baby and it's loaded down with bricks, uh
Call me Pizza Hut 'cause I sell a lot of pies
In the drought, I might get 23 of them guys
23 of them grams? That's a whole lot of mans
See my plug Afghanistan, get my pills from Pakistan
Sold a lot of grams, got them graham crackers man
Green and yellow donk, It's my Green Bay Packer Van
I don't understand, I don't really like the chicks
See I'm known in the 6 for sellin' all them fuckin' bricks (Gucci)

18 bands, I done sold another thang (Yeah)
10 grand cash, that'll get ya bout a half (Yeah)
3 point 5 that's a hundred dollar slab (Phew phew)
