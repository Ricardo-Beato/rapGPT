Heavy On It, mm-hmm
New York, stand the fuck up (Grrah)
When we come out, it look like Princess Diana on the street (Grrah)
Ayo, Ice (Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT)
(Finish 'em)

Like, grrah, keep it a stack
Bitches move wock' 'cause they know I got bands (Damn)
They be chattin', I don't give a damn
And I'm still gettin' money, I know who I am (Grrah)
Tryna be low, he gon' hit up my 'Gram (Grrah)
If he smart, he gon' act like a fan (Damn)
Thinkin' you bigger, they got ya head gassed (Grrah)
Bitches slow, so I give 'em a pass
Like, grrah, keep it a stack
Bitches move wock' 'cause they know I got bands (Damn)
They be chattin', I don't give a damn
And I'm still gеttin' money, I know who I am (Grrah)
Tryna be low, he gon' hit up my 'Gram (Grrah)
If hе smart, he gon' act like a fan (Damn)
Thinkin' you bigger, they got ya head gassed (Grrah)
Bitches slow, so I give 'em a pass

And I just fell in love with a gangsta (Like)
So he put my name in a tat'
But I don't let him come to the crib (Grrah)
So we get it on where we at (Grrah)
Nowadays, I be duckin' them cameras
And they hype that I'm up on them banners
Callin' my phone, but they know I don't answer (Why?)
In the hood, I'm like Princess Diana (Grrah)
I'm thick 'cause I be eatin' oats (Huh)
Bitches not takin' shit from me but notes (Notes)
Wanna be me, so she do my emotes
And my name in her mouth so I bet she gon' choke (Bitch)
To her man, I'm the girl of his dreams
Thinkin' 'bout me when he brushin' his teeth
He keep textin', I leave him on seen
Hottest bitch out and they know what I mean (Know what I mean)
