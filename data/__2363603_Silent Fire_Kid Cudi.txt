11 ContributorsSilent Fire Lyrics
Silent Fire
Silent fire burning in the far
the corners of my soul I don't roam
"Will heaven be brighter?"
Silent fire
"Hold on much tighter"
Silent fire
A woman with fire in her eyes
Lays by the flowers
Welcoming what underneath lays
Silent fire
He goes with her
The path of crystals and shimmering rays
Welcoming me whole in all my ways
A Silent fire
