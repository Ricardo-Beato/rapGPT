7 ContributorsLight It Up Lyrics
I'm systematic, hydromatic
I'm unorthodox like Lenny Kravitz
I don't play guitar, still on your radar
And you can help by screamin, “FUCK YOU HATERS!”
I’m so hungry, I’ll take what’s on your plate
Look in your face like I’ma hit you with the milk crate
They say he one of the greatest, he’s a animal
My appetite is enormous like that of a cannibal
I eat emcees up, you might wanna ease up
I squeeze the trigger like I squeeze on a C cup
The beat is like crack now, you might wanna re up
Pete Rock, hit us with the heat rock, ease up!
I’m on the block straight, smokin' up a Ozone
You in my shit, steady beggin' for my homegrown
The beat is on, the heat is on
If Sen Dog’s Cheech, I must be Chong

When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
Everybody everybody (i'mma light it up)
When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
If you're invited, you're invited (i'mma light it up)
You might also like
I'm so amazing the joint's a blazin'
I can rip a mic on any occassion
My forfeit, your stretched like a limousine for hatin'
Hip hop so we took the nation by storm
A million fans stormed the the stages
The times are changes, my 9 is dangerous
My steel is stainless it will leave you brainless
Young and famous, we run LA
Its all city and can nobody take it
Honey's are waitin'
Backstage at the show they wanna run with the crew
Half-ska but as cool as a fan
With theis moc in my hand Imma stay true to my friends
With this gun in my hand, I stay true to the streets
If you say you are a dealer you have to prove it me

When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
Everybody everybody (i'mma light it up)
When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
If you're invited, you're invited (i'mma light it up)
So much game, fools beggin' for a seminar
You want a bong hit, homie what you beggin' for?
I bring the static when you act dramatic
Got a mix up my sleeve call me Mister Magic

It's automatic, Pete Rock and the Hill
Now that's a classic, ya gots to have it
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
We'll put you in the dirt if you fuck with' us BUST

I'm a natural and I ain't neutral
Come and learn somethin', homie, you can be my pupil
Get out of pocket? Sorry! Yes, my homies'll boot you
Film it on the cam then we put it on YouTube

They try to say I operate with a screw loose
And who am I to say I ain't packin' a deuce-deuce?
Last day out quick to give you a new suit
And a pine box that you better get used to

When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
Everybody everybody (i'mma light it up)
When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
If you're invited, you're invited (i'mma light it up)Embed
