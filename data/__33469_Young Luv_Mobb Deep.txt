Fresh out some bitch pussy, hay in the middle of the barn don
Super hoe putting on a freak show
Inside the mini mansion, had bitches dancing
And a naked bitch who ain't ready
My dick is two percent head, ninety-eighty percent shaft heavy
Steadily long stroking shit
P stands for penetration while y'all parleying
I'm in the back, digging her back, got shorty hollering
Candy girl took a blast of the shit, I got her in
A pretzel, pushing her legs back, she wet too
Perverted niggas do this type of shit all day
Sodomize, modernize 'em up to my standards
1996 bitches got ran through, 1997 cancel that hoe
She blessed the god well though
Word up son, you know what I'm saying, you know how that go though
Caligula style, young love, model actress
Superstar, porno star on a mattress
Looking like Jada Pinkett, I stabbed it
The vultures grabbed it, money no date raped it
Videotaped it, handy camera record
The bitch is blowing me, my dick went soft young love
Scrubbing that crotch with Dove
Potpourri bitches get fucked and mouth plugged
So lady cop, secretarians and librarians
Midtown high-class hoes with pearl earrings
Bump into a true to life vulture like P
Beat you over the head with G, and drag you back
To the cage and let this Mobb nigga coach boo
Train that ass, put it on curfew

Hey, young love
Hey, young love
Young love, young love
Hey, young love
Hey, young love
Hey, young love
Young love, young love

Left it in the hotel, must admit we don't love 'em
Before you consider it foul, let me put you on cousin
Eighty-eight had a vision on some rap shit
Not knowing it would happen, down the road gold status
But back then there was this one little chick
That I wanted to hit, get with, the whole shit
Fourteen, laying my G, little me
I had to have her, had a nigga like me losing Zs
No sleep, fucked up in the head over her physique
Even thought about going downtown (keep it real)
I know there's niggas out there that would've felt the same way
It was the freak in me, actually crossed my mind frequently
Finally and once again we bumped heads
A stank gesture suggested that I was dead
Like a crack-head, didn't even give a nigga rib
But fuck it, what can I say? I tried to put my little bid
And kept living, nigga move on, you a man
No matter what it take we're gonna hold the upper hand
Shuffling beats, six years later son it was done
The Infamous, Mobb Deep left you stuck off the Shook Ones
And then the funniest thing after a show backstage
I peeped chick who didn't give me play back in the day
It was all love, hold no grudge, gave her a hug
What's the drilly baby? She was like "you", nah what's up?
You know me, doing my thing tryna live
Asked if I was busy, could I chill with her in her crib
No days, but we can chill up in the Ramada
Payback is a bitch, once I get in there I got her
In the telly, E&J dick popped the cherry
Left the little hoe with no dough and got jetty
Bless the god boo, you know how we do, it's self-explainable
Un-domesticatable, but highly we capable
The turntables beat you in your own game, enough said
Another victim caught up in fame's web
Young love, young love2Embed
