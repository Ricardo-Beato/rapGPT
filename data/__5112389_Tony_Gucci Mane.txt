12 ContributorsTony Lyrics
Honorable Court

Ridin' around in my town, important
Hit me a lick, it's enormous (Skrrt)
Uh, run with that sack (Run)
They be lookin' for you in the mornin' (Hey)
Uh, look at the batch (Batch)
Got the whole world swarmin' (Uh)
Uh, look at the racks (Woo)
Got the whole world screamin', "Tony"
I feel like Tony when them shooters tried to run in his house
Watchin' the camera with a chopper and a blunt in my mouth
Facin' a FBI indictment, ain't no bondin' me out
I feel like OJ beat a murder 'cause two bodies got found

And I made my bones in East Atlanta
Started from the bottom like Tony Montana
Yellow black 'Rari like a yellow bandana
Crazy young niggas that'll kill you on camera
Gucci Mane got plenty ammo
Y'all gon' need so many candles
Got me bent, I'll bend you backwards
Chopper spent you, bent you backwards
Smoke you like a pack of Backwoods
Go forward ain't never backwards
Pounds of weed and tons of coca
I ran off on Sosa, baby
All my bitches love a gangster
All my bodies drug related
Things escalated, Fezzi made it
My diamonds are never hated
You might also like
Ridin' around in my town, important
Hit me a lick, it's enormous (Skrrt)
Uh, run with that sack (Run)
They be lookin' for you in the mornin' (Hey)
Uh, look at the batch (Batch)
Got the whole world swarmin' (Uh)
Uh, look at the racks (Woo)
Got the whole world screamin', "Tony"
I feel like Tony when them shooters tried to run in his house
Watchin' the camera with a chopper and a blunt in my mouth
Facin' a FBI indictment, ain't no bondin' me out
I feel like OJ beat a murder 'cause two bodies got found

Sold so many drugs (Woah)
They done put me on the Forbes list (Woo)
Ran off with so many packs (Hey)
They done put me on a hitlist (Woo)
And I'm always comin' back
Fuck nigga can't stop this shit (Comin' back)
Niggas creepin' out in the back
Put a nigga on the rocket list (Grrah)

Ridin' around in my town, important
Hit me a lick, it's enormous (Skrrt)
Uh, run with that sack (Run)
They be lookin' for you in the mornin' (Hey)
Uh, look at the batch (Batch)
Got the whole world swarmin' (Uh)
Uh, look at the racks (Woo)
Got the whole world screamin', "Tony"
I feel like Tony when them shooters shot then ran in his house
Watchin' the camera with a chopper and a blunt in my mouth
Facin' a FBI indictment, ain't no bondin' me out
I feel like OJ beat a murder 'cause two bodies got foundEmbed
