That ho let me some strange
That shit nice
Nice, nice, nice, that bitch be like
I just got a new bitch, that bitch be nice
Yeah, you mean, bitch fuck off, be nice
Nah, nah, gloin' up
That shit long as hell
Nice, nice
Nice, nice
(Hoodrich)

Nice, nice, nice, I just got a new bitch, she nice
Shawty got a booty, it's nice
Baby, you never seen this much nice shit in your life
Bitch, everything that I buy nice (Phew)
I'm always Gloin' like a light (Phew)
You can call me any damn thing but nice (Phew)
I just got a new crib, it's nice, nice

Nice, nice, nice, I'm sippin' on this dirty Sprite
I got a nice gun to take your life
Bitch these Balenciagas, these ain't no Mikes
And they nice, nice, nice, I payed three hundred twice
I'm 300 and 300 twice
And growin' up was nothin' nice
So I tote pipes, pipes, pipes
Fuck with me, I'll shoot you twice
And it ain't gon' be nothin' nice
We left his ass, he wasn't right
They say my cup too dirty, I'm gon' die
And it ain't gon' be nothin' nice
I'm goin' out with my pipe
Havin' a shootout with the Sprite

Nice, nice, nice, I just got a new bitch, she nice
Shawty got a booty, it's nice
Baby, you never seen this much nice shit in your life
Bitch, everything that I buy nice (Phew)
I'm always Gloin' like a light (Phew)
You can call me any damn thing but nice (Phew)
I just got a new crib, it's nice, nice6Embed
