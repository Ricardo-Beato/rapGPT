I keep one in the chamber (chamber) so I ain't gotta cock it (cock it)
You gets no respect ('spect) I mean none at all (none at all)
I'm in the junk yard (junk yard) runnin body parts (body parts)
Roll another blunt ('nother blunt) Magic another blunt (never blunt)
It might look gravy (gravy) but this ain't what'cha want
My money on the rise (on the rise) yo' money standin still (standin still)
On fire with the tools (tools) better with the steel (steel)
Fuck with my nigga Cat (Cat) nigga watch your mouth (mouth)
Cause any disrespect ('spect) I'll be at'ch house (house)

See we can shoot it out (shoot it out) or we can duke it out (duke it out)
But all that Hollywood shit I can do without (this fo'real)
I roll with drug dealers (drug dealers) body snatchers (body snatchers)
Cap peelers (cap peelers) and kidnappers (kidnappers)
Murderers (murderers) and burglarers (burglarers)
Mercinaries (mercenaries) you ain't never scary (never scary)

Gucci Mane bitch, Big Cat ruckus
You ain't gotta like us, but you must respect us

Uhh...

Ay it's a movement, it 'bout to be some changes
We will be respected, what the fuck y'all niggas thankin? (Hahaha)
We squaded up, camouflaged down, ragged up
We can get it poppin, got ther choppers in the stash box (stash box)
With Magic on the scene (scene) niggas gettin shook (shook)
We knock 'em down first round and we ain't usin' hooks (nope)
I'm from the streets so you know I think the same way
And plus my gun don't shoot water down dawg naan day
You need bricks nigga? Me and Gucci got it (Gucci got it)
One call and Young Snead'll have them toolies poppin
You could be from the North (North) or from the South (South)
I don't discriminate, I'm shootin if your run your mouth
We ridin speed boats (speed boats), and they full of coke (full of coke)
The word is out - we supply the whole East coast
Lemonhead chains (chains), and my watch is Skittles (Skittles)
New H2 interior like peanut brittle

See we can get it poppin - UHH...Embed
