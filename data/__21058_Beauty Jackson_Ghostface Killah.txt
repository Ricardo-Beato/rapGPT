20 ContributorsBeauty Jackson Lyrics
Standing at the bus stop
I heard a voice behind me saying: "Hi, baby"
Ohh I just fell all apart inside
Because I hadn't heard that voice in such a long time
I turned around...

That's right y'all, y'all shoulda seen what I did
So so pretty, so pretty - y'all hear how she sounds right?
She sounds crazy right? Yes
This what happened at the bus stop

She turned around and this grown lady said hi
I was quite stunned from the way she replied
Peace, nice to meet ya, sweetie call me Tony Starks
Ghost if you like ta, mind if I invite ya
Over for some red wine, nice Barry White huh
She pulled out a cigarette, hon here's a lighter
Her voice was a slow jam, full length white mink
Hella fine with a beauty mark on her right cheek
When she spoke her smoke floated when it left her throat
Spelled honey when she blew it out it turned to water word
I was infatuated
She put the perfume to her neck and sprayed it
Plus the bottle was nickel plated
It make a young girl steez yo feel outdated
And know the married chicks shopping with they man's hated
One stone on her finger was green, Maybelline
Cover Girl lipstick, Plumb color fingertips
Revlon face blush, oh-five-six shit
The ashes was hangin off her stog' so she flicked it
Damn, had to bundle up, I caught goosebumps
Plus the windchill factor had dropped, here the bus come
I never rush one, here take my number miss
I live alone, her face fell when I dropped the chrome
Damn, can I have YOUR number? {*bus pulls away*}You might also like1Embed
