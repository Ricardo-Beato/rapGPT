21 ContributorsBeauty and the Beat Lyrics
Uh, beauty and the beat
It's pretty ugly what I do to any beat
Amen, Hallelujah, nigga, preach
She wanna lay up but I shoot too many threes
Goddamn

Now, the mula got her speakin'
I've speakin' for myself, I thought of usin' Robin Leach
I just bought Barbie a gift and it's an Uzi, got it pink
Should I teach her how to shoot it? She might take a shot at me
We some killers round this bitch, where it's kill or be killed
Prescription refill, pop a pill and be still
Not for nothin', for the most, we hold a toast at each meal
I can flip a Jae Mill to a fuckin' Meek Mill
Knock on wood, it might answer back when you this real
Fuck your bitch, told her, "Hit me back whеn I clear here”
I could roll a blunt fastеr than your get your ears pierced
I'ma shoot your ass exactly where you get your ears pierced
Never seen a bigger ticket than this, little bitty nigga
New Orleans, burry me up in the middle of it, nigga
I've been peepin', I've been squintin' and I still can't see a limit
Higher than my limitations, and the fuckin' Himalayas
And I'm stuntin on my neighbors
And the blunt as long as cables
There’s some hundreds on the table
That was our paper towels
Left my number for the waitress
She was flirtin', I embraced it
Now I'm fuckin' her and the women I was on a date with
I'm a god among Satans, I'm the doc that lost patience
I went from the judge sentence to a fuckin' fashion statement
Disappear like David Blaine when it come to affidavits
Aphrodisiac, all on your bitch face like aftershave
I never met Captain Save 'Em, Army, better yet, a Navy
Wore a sweater for the ladies
Pockets heavy, set inflated
That Prometh' it got me faded
Tell the chef that I'm the gravy
My bitch pussy hole so deep, feel like I'm steppin' out the grave
And that's the beauty in it
You might also like
The beauty in the beat
Steppin' out the pussy, therapeutic for my feet
Amen, Hallelujah, nigga, preach
She wanna lay up, I've been shootin' too many threes
God damn, it's the beauty and the beat
But it get pretty ugly what I do to any beat
Amen, Hallelujah, nigga, preach
And you're the only one that left the funeral in peace, yeah

It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful, it's beautiful)
It's beautiful, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful, it's beautiful)
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (Yeah, oh, oh)
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (It's beautiful, it's beautiful)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's beautiful, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallelujah, nigga, preach
Hallelujah, nigga, preach, amen (Beautiful, beautiful)
