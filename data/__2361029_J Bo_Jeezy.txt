4 ContributorsJ Bo Lyrics
Roll up the swishers, get money lay low
Just ask them bitches I ball like J Bo
Rose’ we piss it, get money lay low
Shine in my pictures, pull up like J Bo
Death before dishonor I put that on my mama (like JBo)
Shine in all my pictures (pull up like JBo)
Rose’ and them swishers (pull up like JBo)
I want that Corvette and that Audemar
Compartments all in my other car
Light show at my table, 100 bottles like J Bo Bitch!

I know some real niggas doing real time
Snitches out here living real fine
I know the lawyer bought in didn’t wait on him
Road dog done went state on him
Talking Audemar that AP
Too cold talking AC
No procrastination, no stalling
We ain’t falling, we balling
Still up ain’t fell yet
Probably why them niggas upset
Tryna throw me off I’m too smart on them
Swear its too easy to make it hard on them
Cup full I’m in my own zone
Got hustling all in my chromosome
Do this shit for them havenots
Represent the struggle, I’m the mascot
Stay low key when you grinding
So when they see ya you shining
Rose gold, sky dweller, grown man no diamonds
Summer time with those links on
Winter time with those minks on
Want a light show at my table
Bottles coming like JBo bitch
You might also like
Roll up the swishers, get money lay low
Just ask them bitches I ball like J Bo
Rose’ we piss it, get money lay low
Shine in my pictures, pull up like J Bo
Death before dishonor I put that on my mama (like JBo)
Shine in all my pictures (pull up like JBo)
Rose’ and them swishers (pull up like JBo)
I want that Corvette and that Audemar
Compartments all in my other car
Light show at my table, 100 bottles like J Bo Bitch!

Make a movie off in the parking lot what you call that
Drive thru valet on click-clack, got the bottles coming like 6 packs
Keep 'em coming like Bud Lights when you living that plug life
Me and J Beezy we back to back
Dude behind us in his Maybach
Murcielago with those shades on
Nigga hood fresh with them J’s on
Was the first nigga in that new Vette
With Forgies on it  and it was offset
Violate we gone demonstrate
So much smoke we need to ventilate
They knew better, they do better
New jeans on  new leather
Stay in black big Darth Vader
Duffle bag and it's full of paper
Got paper want more paper
Ain't got enough want more haters
Club night nigga every night when you living that club life
Fuck the couch we on the table
Bottles coming like J Bo bitch
Roll up the swishers, get money lay low
Just ask them bitches I ball like J Bo
Rose’ we piss it, get money lay low
Shine in my pictures, pull up like J Bo
Death before dishonor I put that on my mama (like JBo)
Shine in all my pictures (pull up like JBo)
Rose’ and them swishers (pull up like JBo)
I want that Corvette and that Audemar
Compartments all in my other car
Light show at my table, 100 bottles like J Bo Bitch!2Embed
