16 ContributorsA New Day Lyrics
Spend two hundred on a bitch, huh
I feel like I'm rich, huh
She think that I'm famous, she wanna fuck, I'm faded
She wanna fuck 'cause she think I'm on TV, woah
Pussy wet like Fiji, woah
Don't think that I need you, woah
Skrrt off, you won't see me (Yeah!)

It's a new day, different bitch
It's a new day (Yeah!), different bitch
It's a new day, different bitch
It's a new day, different bitch

Made my bitch mad (No!), I think I'm sorry (Yeah!)
Nah, I'm not sorry (No!), okay, fine, sorry
Twin turbo with a Benz and a jeep, I sit and laugh
I think I'm cool, my closet full (Yeah!)
Woah, I'm just foolin' with your bands now, can't be out of town
Turbulence with all my friends now, that ho like my swag
When I fuck, I hit my dance moves (Yeah!), her boyfriend a lame
I think he my biggest fan too

Spend two hundred on a bitch, huh
I feel like I'm rich, huh
She think that I'm famous, she wanna fuck, I'm faded
She wanna fuck 'cause she think I'm on TV, woah
Pussy wet like Fiji, woah
Don't think that I need you, woah
Skrrt off, you won't see me (Yeah!)

It's a new day, different bitch
It's a new day (Yeah!), different bitch
It's a new day, different bitch
It's a new day, different bitchEmbed
