(Wheezy outta here)

Sitting behind five percent, you can see the chinain
Lil' one going crazy, ready to sprrt for the ginang
If it wasn’t for Google, man that bitch wouldn't know my nickname
Dropped a Maybach truck on a watch and it was plain jane
Let the door swang, swang the door open, smell cocaine
Trafficking drug money and trap out this one lane
Stepped all in mud, this bitch can't wait to tie my shoelace
Oh, she don’t like girls, bet this money make a bitch so gay

Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff
Digging in hеr back, pull out my money, make a bitch bust a nut
Came out thе bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick
I bought the Tahoe from the trap money, haven't even seen a brick
Cocaine by the kilo, these days put it right on my wrist
You can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent

Every time I re-up, they gotta advance at least twenty M
I been getting richer and richer my whole career
Took the dope money, went and record a mixtape, it's rappers way out
Sitting on a bail toting a big K, ain't even got a couch
To Australia, I'm familiar, spent two million on a jet
In that dualie doing the dash, I let lil' dawg he hold a TEC
I got molly with the crystals, but I been back doing X
Got a Rolex on my wrist, this bitch cost 'bout a Corvette
Give these niggas a couple bands and hit your face and hit your chest
I was rolling off the pill, I should’ve never fucked the bitch
I got hoes these niggas married, I don’t let 'em go, they come through
I got fentanyl in my diamonds, I spend a nine on a pair of shoes
I don’t even care who these niggas shot at, ain't nan of 'em got murked
I got some real killers, they'll kill a nigga, then go and shoot up the hearse
You think a nigga like me give a fuck ’bout a nigga shooting up the church?
I gotta take this shit up with God 'cause I'm a god on the earth
I got this motherfuckin' new Benz, I ain't even drove it since it came out
Couple of bad bitches, they twins, walkin' naked through my house
Cook good dope up in the kitchen, I could do that top chef
Bitches still claiming me, I ain't fucked in over a year

Cartier wrist, Cartier watch, Cartier diamond buff
Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff
Digging in her back, pull out my money, make a bitch bust a nut
Came out the bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick
I bought the Tahoe from the trap money, haven't even seen a brick
Cocaine by the kilo, these days put it right on my wrist
You can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent

Sitting behind five percent, you can see the chinain
Lil' one going crazy, ready to sprrt for the ginang
Stepped all in mud, this bitch can't wait to tie my shoelace
Oh, she don't like girls, bet this money make a bitch so gay16Embed
