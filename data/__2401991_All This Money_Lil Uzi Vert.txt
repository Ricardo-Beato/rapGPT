All this money, all this money
All this money
(DP on the beat)
All this money, all this money, all

I said "Hold up, back back"
Told that girl "Get off me" (off me)
I swear that I'm ballin' (ballin')
All this money fallin' (fallin')
Told my mom "Don't worry"
All this money on me (on me)
Now your bitch all on me
Lil' nigga, I'm sorry (sorry)
I said "Hold up, back back"
Told that girl "Get off me" (off me)
I swear that I'm ballin' (ballin')
All this money fallin' (fallin')
Told my mom "Don't worry"
All this money on me (on me)
Now your bitch all on me (on me)
Lil' nigga, I'm sorry (sorry)

I just fucked your bitch and now you lookin' sad, damn
Hit it from the back and now the blonde be clappin'
Countin' all this money thought I still was trappin' (yeah)
Water on my jewels, my diamonds get to dancin'
Like hold up, roll up, I just got my dough up
I just talked to ManeMane, listenin' to Sosa
Doin' shows with Rocky, share my ho with Carti
Braid my hair like Muddy, dread my hair like Thugger
Used to argue with my mother
Pray to the lord to watch over my brother
We gon' be rich by next summer
All my shooters, yeah, they my lovers

And I know I'm young but don't card me (no)
And I dream chase with my Barbie (yeah)
Getting all these racks off these shows
Don't fuck with rats, now you know (now you know)
Boy, I swear your style is so old (so old)
Boy, I swear your style growing mold (growing mold)
