Centralised or way out in the sticks

Ha ha ha ha
Ha, ha ha ha ha
Ha! Ha ha ha ha
Ah-ha ha ha, ah-ha ha ha ha, ha!!

Now, this goes out to all area cliques
Centralized or way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the De La in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup, our sound is game thick
Now, this goes out to all area cliques
From manicured lawns to projects bricks / from 718 to the 51-6
Remember to keep the Mos Def in the mix
Straight butter hits, drop as good as it gets

Now, come on, y'all, get live, get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So don't none of y'all just be misled
The De La's gonna do the body good like wheat bread
Shakin' laces outta shoes, Mos Def brought the brews
Sittin' Indian squats to make that bread tie knots
See, I'm out to get the coin like in them rainbow pots (Wooo!)
Swingin' life like a hammock, invested like stocks
Through your sinus complex, I aims to clog it up
Slappin' fives with pain is a crew here to gain
We remain on your mind like skulls
Not a dull moment shown
When in the house, all perimeters are blown
Native Tongue come through to make you say, "Yes! Yes!"
This is the mighty Mos Def, style fresh like baby breath
We are the killer combination with the size to administer
The beatdown to swell up all three of your eyes
You might also like
Now, this goes out to all area cliques
Centralized or way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the De La in the mix
'Cause just like log cabin syrup, our sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area cliques
From manicured lawns to project bricks
Remember to keep the Native Tongue in the mix
Straight butter hits, we as good as it gets
Now, check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop
Now, check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop

I don't bug out, I chill, don't be actin' ill
No tricks in '96, Native Tongue gon' build
But we be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
'Cause to me, MC mean makin' C.R.E.A.M
When I speak on groups and I'm smooth like gabardine
Tryin' to hang out with Dove and catch love in Aberdeen (Word up)
I bag dimes like my man born on August 17
Life be nuthin' but a river, son, I'm swimmin' upstream
Playin' wait up! With the data servin' your ears
With information due to confirmation of the nation's most
Wicked ways of livin', like them glassy eyed beans
Inhale the smoke of fiends, while bangin' the tape
Rated at the high point of the mass
Rippin' MC's at the top of our class
Occasionally, rippin' some sucka's face
Or some suckable ass from a girl
It's the big brother beat for the wide wide world
I'm makin' memos off these demos, back in '89
Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind (Right)
Did the hustle with a couple of us, but soon noted
That my niggas buttered Benedict rolls, and then voted
I wrote in the dark so I could feel it like braille (Uh-huh)
Heard the big brother beat, got locked with no bail
Came to set it like equators, invented with the heat
Yo, Mos Def, how you radiate to make it complete?
(Right!! *echoes*) So when I shine the light crabs wince
Manifestin' for the future here in the present tense
No doubt, I love the sound biggin' out off your Jeeps
Son, I want the little kids bangin' big brother beats
Now, this goes out to all area cliques
Centralized or way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the Native Tongues in the mix
Just like log cabin syrup, our sound is game thick
Now, this goes out to all area cliques, from 718 to 516
Remember to keep the De La in the mix

Yo, we straight butter hits, we straight butter hits
We straight butter hits, we straight butter hits
Manteca, manteca
