Waterboading hip-hop i’m tortured the flow like water
The drop over yeah here we go
We usd to spit now i flow my soul to the shit
Crazy god mobb deep goes hard and never ends
You can drown in the ocean the dopeness
Jump in to this deep darker ..and swimming they wish
They pray, they hope, they dream make a piece soul fresh
All my drive and passion super sees they attempts to do
Just like H just like P the .. reaven air they compare with this
They lead niggas from new .. that’s hold this new .. they know who i ..
You want that slow pain that’s so respect my team
Will get one tone more babe my vein they believe
The blood of a young done boy i squeeze if i pull a ..
And i sting like the bullets for the fight i would ..
And i said the bottom slow flow drip to the nigga pool
No stop flows I’m about to ..a double mena sixteen
This is that queen shit
2 x Hook:
I’m psycho regret get your brain wet
We can’t let the shit fall, the shit fall
We too strong we too dope
We torture these niggas waterboard these niggas
We torture these niggas waterboard these niggas
You might also likeI think I'm Dick Cheney, George Bush
The way I waterboard these niggas got 'em all shook
A verse I spit is fire got 'em coughing up soot
A gruesome act committed, and his judges throw the book
So this is for my niggas, trapped in them dungeons bidding
No commissary coming so you know they guns are spitting
That's just the way we living society won't forgive us
But we don't ask forgiveness, we take it that's a stick up
Who want be opposition, that's when the plot it thicken
My mind is so malicious how you sleeping with them fishes
The world is mine I figure, and everything that's in it
That dead armor Popeyes have you leaking spinach
And so you finished, expired like old milk
I catch the bodies it ain't over till the quota filled
Call it overkill stand over you holding still
Empty out on the closed casket funeral
