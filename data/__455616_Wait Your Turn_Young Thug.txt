14 ContributorsWait Your Turn Lyrics
Yeah, yeah (Hell yes)
Yeah (Fuck yes), yeah
Sheesh, eeee (Fuck yes)
Eeee (Thug)

We done ran down the plug but we can’t no more
We done flipped all the dope but we can’t no more
We done fucked all these bitches but we can’t no more
We done slutted all these bitches but we can’t no more
While you suck me up, YSL me to the floor
And the bitch behind 'em, please wait your turn
Please wait your turn
Please wait your turn
Please wait your turn

Baby girl got curls like Big Worm
She catch me slipping and suck off all my germs
Mr. Jeff, this bitch just ain't gon' learn (teach her, teach her)
I make her write a book like she a worm
(Ah, ah, ah) Skeeted right up in her perm
(Yah, yah, yah) Here go 10 racks that you earned
(Nah, nah, nNah) You ain't get no fuckin' more of it
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt) Pull off on me, I'm like dern
Walkin' on these thousands leave these bitches in my trousers
Leave they head inside my boxers
Leave they head inside my carburetor
Leave her in the loft, I'm goin' leave a YSL boss
She don't ask me for no cost
Perfect mouth, but she quiet like a mouse
You might also like
We done ran down the plug but we can’t no more
We done flipped all the dope but we can’t no more
We done fucked all these bitches but we can’t no more
We done slutted all these bitches but we can’t no more
While you suck me up, YSL me to the floor
And the bitch behind 'em, please wait your turn
Please wait your turn
Please wait your turn
Please wait your turn

Make her wake like a week before my funeral
Diamonds dancing in the night, look like lightning bugs
Molly Cyrus, break her down, put her on my tongue
Got this Ragu on my feet, chicken pox on her tongue
Everywhere I go it be, it be, it be, it be
Seventh letter of the alphabet, I'm being G
I'm just being G
Gave him letter after A 'cause he just wanna be
He just wanna rock like that, he wanna rock like this
He wanna cop them VVSs hurricane that wrist
I hurricaned his bitch
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

We done ran down the plug but we can’t no more
We done flipped all the dope but we can’t no more
We done fucked all these bitches but we can’t no more
We done slutted all these bitches but we can’t no more
While you suck me up, YSL me to the floor
And the bitch behind 'em, please wait your turn
Please wait your turn
Please wait your turn
Please wait your turnEmbed
