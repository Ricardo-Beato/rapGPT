120 ContributorsIâ€™m Not Real Lyrics
No
Yeah
No
Uh

Passport, fillin' it up with stamps
Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan (Yeah)
She keep on askin' for a rack, so I ran
Lookin' back like you can't see who I am
Think my bitch don't know me no more (No more)
'Cause every time she's sad, I can't console her no more (No more)
If money buy you love (Love), then love's not enough ('Nough)
So tell me why you on your knees cryin' to the floor
If you had the chance
Would you take the time you need to make it right?
The clouds are gray, but would you pay the price to paint 'em white?
Might have a baby on the way
'Cause I've been goin' in raw, it feel better, that real pleasure
I'm not real, I think I never was (Was)
I get a rush every time she let me get a touch (Touch)
I need to feel that (Love), I need to feel that (Pain)
My garden hasn't been growin', so can you bring that (Rain)?
I keep my head up (High), a little fed up (Lies)
They always tell me where my mind is on this LP
I don't (Exist), hiero-(Glyphics)
Pyro-(Technics), meta-(Physics)
Telekinetics put 50K on my credit card (Card)
Look for the answers, I'm searchin' but I ain't gettin' far (Far)
Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon
Decepticon, hit it 'til my head is gone
You might also like
Point me to a road (To a road)
And I'ma run it, bloodhound with my nose (My nose)
To the money, ain't fuckin' with these hoes (Never that)
Gettin' ducats 'til I die while my foes (My foes)
Busy runnin', fuck it, marijuana smoke in my stomach (Uh)
Toasted in public (Uh)
Head in the clouds, but my toes in the struggle
Like, who dare to test it? (Dare to test it)
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch (Uh, yeah; in effect, bitch)
Listen up, go
See, this a rather spooky action movie, roll it up and pass it to me
Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie actin' boujee
(See a creature) At its beauty (Need a feature) Rather shoot me
Truly, bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you, in fact, assuming
Back to doing (Cash pursuing), posted up like (Patrick Ewing)
Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it
Don't forget, you infested in nesting crevices
Allowin' birds to fall to their death before they even fly (Brr)
He and I are not the same
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me somethin' for the pain
Money in machines ('Chines), those will make you change (Change)
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain, but I can't complain
Point me to a road (To a road)
And I'ma run it, bloodhound with my nose (My nose)
To the money, ain't fuckin' with these hoes (Never that)
Gettin' ducats 'til I die while my foes (My foes)
Busy runnin', fuck it, marijuana smoke in my stomach (Uh)
Toasted in public (Uh)
Head in the clouds, but my toes in the struggle
Like, who dare to test it? (Dare to test it)
It's a few new rules in effect, bitch (In effect, bitch)
