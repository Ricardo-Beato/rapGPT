Groove thang, groove thang, groove thang...
Yeah, cause I be rockin' my two chains
And I do things, and I do things...
Yeah, cause I be all on my groove thang
My groove thang, my groove thang...
Yeah, just watch me now in my groove thang...
My groove thang, my groove thang...
Yeah, cause I be all on my groove thang
Yeah, just watch me now...

Too hippy to be cut-throat - hippies blow the best smoke
Rollin' up RAWs and living royal
All my and bays & jays is loyal, they won't leave me cause I spoil
The baddest of them all, the hash is why I won't fall
Molasses can't match my crawl, I'm higher than all of y'all
They sayin' they born to ball, I'm sayin' I'm Santa Claus
Funny jokes I tell all, always inhale fog
Nappy dreads, my hair long - Diamond 5-foot bong
Could never be a clone...


It's a new thang and a new look
Kids be makin' our names in the book
Who you wanna be when you grow up?
The Broadus Boyz, we actin' up
We showin' out and we show up
We ballin', it's all we know, it's not an option
You see us, and yes, we poppin'
Standin' tall, we not fallin'
On top, and yes, we callin' shots
What you thought? I'm in charge and I'm the boss
Do a show and then we shop for the flyest gear
We up in here, dippin' and dodging, man, changing gears
This the life we chose, so you gon' hear this all year
