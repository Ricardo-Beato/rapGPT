TrapHouseMob (Woo, grrt)
What's rockin', cuz? (Woo, woo, woo, bah)
Ayy, CZR, you did a mazza still (Bah)
This is a Melo Beat (Bah, bah), look

Dior on my body (Woo, uh)
Head to toe like a mannequin (Mannequin)
Amiri denims got them panickin' (Woo)
I pour a four in my Fanta (Fanta)
If my opps in a foreign (Foreign)
Then we shootin' up the Phantom
Dior on my body (Uh)
Head to toe like a mannequin
Amiri denims got them panickin'
I pour a four in my Fanta
If my opps in a foreign (Grrt)
Then we shootin' up the Phantom (Bah)

Big Glock up on my hip (Woo)
That mean I don't ever slip (Woo)
Run up on me, I'ma whack a nigga
Clap a nigga, skate off in the whip (Bah)
Gucci foreign, see the drip (Uh)
Fifty-five hundred the 'fit (Woo)
55K on my wrist (Bah)
I'm tired of jackin', my money legit (Grrt)
You might also like
Trav' got the Urus, Boy got the Huracan
I got the Range, and all of them paid
I'm from the Floss, I'm a double G
And I know 'bout puttin' in pain
I spent fifty on my left wrist (Woo)
Another hundred on the chain (Woo)
Try to reach and we takin' shots close range (Bah)

Baow, bang, hit his brain (Woo, woo)
Catch me an opp, I'ma treat him and beat him and show him he lame (Grrt)
I lost my brother, shit won't be the same
Ever since then, I been goin' insane (Bah)
Do it for Smelly, I do it for gang
And nina gon' wet 'em up, show 'em my pain (Grrt)

Big Louboutin for the steppin'
Big .38 for the weapon
And I catch a case for nothin' (Nothin')
I back the Wraith for nothin' (For nothin')
Gas 'em up, Getty (Getty)
Rock steady, rock steady (Steady)
Shots hit your belly (Woo)
Runtz pack got me deady (Woo)
Checks, Chevy
Swing at BOA, we ready
R.I.P. them fallen soldiers
Screamin' free my nigga Melly (Grrt)
All this shit been in my mind
Smokin' dope, I'm gettin' deady (Woo, woo)
Lotta pressure's on my shoulders
Steady movin', but it's heavy (Grrt)
I was posted by the deli
Any means to get it, early morning, I was ready (Bah)
Think I fell in love with fetti
She give super neck, I think I fell in love with Betty (Woo, woo)
Tati ate it like spaghetti
I ain't even mean to say it, but I'm bein' petty
2020, vision steady
You know I ain't finna hesi'
Crossover for the cheddy

Dior on my body (Uh)
Head to toe like a mannequin (Mannequin)
Amiri denims got them panickin' (Woo)
I pour a four in my Fanta (Fanta)
If my opps in a foreign (Foreign)
Then we shootin' up the Phantom
Dior on my body (Uh)
Head to toe like a mannequin
Amiri denims got them panickin'
I pour a four in my Fanta
If my opps in a foreign (Grrt)
Then we shootin' up the Phantom (Bah)14Embed
