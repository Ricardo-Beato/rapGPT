Ay yeah, what's happening mommy? How you doing baby?
Oh you looking kinda good and everything, I see you with them stilettos on baby
Ay check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me?
Ay let me put the bug in your ear baby
Why don't you turning them floor shoes into some ho shoes, ya dig?
Yeah, check this out, this Universe Finest, your Royal Highness
You know what baby? I can do a whole lot of thangs for you
Guess why, 'cause I'm a motherfucking pimp

(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
I-In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you a nigga
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you

The good man in me say, "Get money and stay on the path"
But the pimp shit in me say, "Yo, keep looking for ass"
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait 'til you grown, when he love you, you'll know
Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two
Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick
Revenge to get, against - who I don't know
Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake
They mistake blaming me for they failures, I'm fresh, getting tailored
Single breasted, a lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit
A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, 'cause he still with her
She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga...

(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
I-In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you a nigga
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you

Ay pimping been going on man for eons and eons man since the beginning of time
You know me, the only thing I need to do is get on the grind, and get mine
So the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know
Do what you gotta do man
Bring my money back, get on that track and get on your back

I heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves
A portea wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is
Jerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings
Let's just say more than collectively all of his players
That's business, not really pimp shit
Maybe a tid-bit similar to when we rappers make big hits
And not own the masters, that's the deal
By the way, Poitier helps all the Denzels excel
He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out
I knew a girl 'bout, 5'9", so fine, she could for sure grind
She was sleek, chic, with a classic mouth
Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch
She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler
She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road
I showed her all my stones and gold
I said "Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga"
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
I-In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you a nigga
(Like me...) Hustling and grinding babe
(I be...) Staying on that paper chase
In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, youEmbed
