4 ContributorsR.I.P. Blackat LyricsTonight I can't sleep, I just stare at the wall
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
Tonight I can't sleep, I just stare at the wall
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
Tonight I can't sleep, I just stare at the wall
It's like we was from the sandbox, I miss my dog
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
It's like back in '94 when we were first met
In Houston, Texas, I was on tour, I'll never forget
You had me come out to Houston to play celebrity basketball games
You had towels and cups and shirts with my name
When Flavor Flav walked in the gym, the gym lit up
I was hot, on fire, couldn't tell a nigga shit! (WHAT?!?)
We became boys and had that connection
All you wanted for me was go in the right direction
I started having my darkest days, up in the streets of
New York secretly diggin' my grave
With the drugs and the thugs, everything that was white
I dug it out the rugs, I was goin'
1700.4 miles per hour
From the top of the Empire State, I seen the Eiffel Tower
Then you came through and you helped save my life
And I'll never forget you my dude, my boy for life

Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
Tonight I can't sleep, I just stare at the wall
It's like we was from the sandbox, I miss my dog
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
Thanks to Blackat he gave me a place to stay
So I could have a chance to take my life another way
Because of the way the shit was goin'
I had money flowin' but I wasn't flowin' like the money was flowin'
So he said come to Houston and see what you could do here
I'll give you a room at the crib and food to share
You ain't even got to pay me no rent
You can stay here with me at the crib bro and get high, get bent
I don't care just long as you're doin' good
You could stay here as long as you could
Whatever you do, I'll never hold it against you
You's a grown man, can't hold it against you
We boys till the end, can't hold it against you
When you need a ticket to New York, I sent ya
I'm your homie all the way to the grave
You could always speak to everybody through your boy Flav
Tonight I can't sleep, I just stare at the wall
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog
Tonight I can't sleep, I just stare at the wall
It's like we was from the sandbox, I miss my dog
Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dogEmbed
