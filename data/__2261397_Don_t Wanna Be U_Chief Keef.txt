20 ContributorsDonâ€™t Wanna Be U Lyrics
(Real 808 Beats)
Like you need
I don't wanna be
Almighty
Ayy (Tarantino)
(808 Mafia)
(808 Mafia)

Break the blunt down, put some weed in
Smokin' on this dope, it ain't got no seeds in 'em
Niggas hatin', but Sosa be the reason
Niggas Glo'd all up and ridin' Lamborghinis
I fucks with God, but I gotta be a demon
I got my money, because I got 'em, I don't need ya
Bitch, you don't like me, I don't like you neither
If you in front of my thirty, I don't wanna be ya

I don't wanna be you
I wouldn't wanna see you when I get through
They look like Almighty TTU
I hang with pitbulls, your niggas Shih-Tzu
I got a big gun and a big clip too
Try to run, hollows get you
Like where you goin'? Nigga, I been sent you
Pussy nigga
You ain't got no nothing, you don't even got no pussy, nigga
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, nigga
But I got a lot of guns, try me, you'll be cooked meat, nigga
You might also like
Break the blunt down, put some weed in
Smokin' on this dope, it ain't got no seeds in 'em
Niggas hatin', but Sosa be the reason
Niggas Glo'd all up and ridin' Lamborghinis
I fucks with God, but I gotta be a demon
I got my money, because I got 'em, I don't need ya
Bitch, you don't like me, I don't like you neither
If you in front of my thirty, I don't wanna be ya5Embed
