6 ContributorsGotta Get It (Atlanta Gave Me Vision) Lyrics
, jewelry, and interviews
Earings, outfits, new whips, and tennis shoes
My girl, Mariah Carry with the hairdo
08 baby, but I'm 09 Camero
Iced out 
Woke up this morning in a mansion
Jumped up with a bad bitch, start laughing
Started balling, living the day like it's my last
But I don't think so, cause I started blessing
Cars real clean, but the whip game nasty
Ugly ass nigga, but I pulled up in a Phantom
Might be ugly, but my car is real handsome
(It's Gucci!)

Its twenty-five for a half, twenty-four for a ho nigga
This the drought season, everybody work the stove
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Country nigga get texts, and flicks for his set
I'm laughing at him, causе he can't get it back
Gotta get it up
Gotta gеt it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up

Junky can't hit the fence, but come test the dope for me
Got a couple bands, the stash is still grocery
Good dope come in this week, well shit, hopefully
Can't ask a nigga, cause I ain't down with that friend shit
But I'm ready to eat, like school time with lunches
Got rock-solid, yeah don't fuck with that crunk shit
Shawty with the 62., went to 1-1-1-6
Got all white bricks, you might cop six
On the way home, he on the phone with 
Hard time trappin', that nigga just got tricked
Laughing at them lame niggas, ha ha ha, bitch

Its twenty-five for a half, twenty-four for a ho nigga
This the drought season, everybody work the stove
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Country nigga get texts, and flicks for his set
I'm laughing at him, cause he can't get it back
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Who is this? Who is this?
That boy, you sold a dummy brick
Flip me for one-twenty, Gucci, can you give me something 
I ain't giving nothing, 'lil boy, no more money spent
Gone, I done fucked it all, you can get a hundred dose
Matter fact don't call my phone, cause 
If you needed gas, swear you couldn't get a hundred gallons
Gucci Mane LaFlare, feel like beefing with a hundred ho's
Fuck niggas acting like they hard, they get their car 
Tied to a  exhaust, 
Swimming with them fishes pull them up, they'll be your souvenir
Country nigga coming up, by twenty with a bag of money
Devil on my shoulder and he telling me to take it from you

Its twenty-five for a half, twenty-four for a ho nigga
This the drought season, everybody work the stove
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Country nigga get texts, and flicks for his set
I'm laughing at him, cause he can't get it back
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it up
Gotta get it upEmbed
