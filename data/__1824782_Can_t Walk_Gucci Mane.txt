10 ContributorsCanâ€™t Walk Lyrics
I told you grind and go hard, don't even play with the deal
The bitch so fine I stay away from the chick
Her ass so fat I gotta pay for the shit
No lies, she's so bad you take a trip with the bitch
White girl in the bedroom pillow talk in this shit
Michael Jackson, chest of diamonds, moonwalk in this shit
She got some hips bigger than a hippopotamus ape
Tryna put the dick all in yo esophagus babe
She second week, oh get some barbs, I said let's eat on the way
I'm tryna leave a good impression, bitch you're right on yo face
She told me Gucci you a dog, I told her give me a break
I'll take you anywhere you want except take you on a date

Damn, damn, I swear these niggas in trouble
Pockets so fat that I can't walk, walk
I swear these bitches in trouble
So geek'd off that she can't talk, talk
These diamonds got me so turnt up
Yo bitch choosin me so how it's my fault, fault?
She feelin us so she think that she so turnt up
I told er get er shit and get out my house

Gucci Gucci, that's my motherfuckin dog
BSM, going hard, we be putting on
Wooh Da Kid thuggin like the '94 Pac
100 round drum, bug got 94 shots
Diamonds got me turnt, yo bitch on my dick
Everything squad baby, everything brick
We be going hard nigga, we be on our shit
Brand new 40 with a stupid rubber grip
I be on my grind, swear you niggas over with
Brick Squad all foreign, we exposin shit
My pockets so dumb that I can't walk
If we ain't speakin money then it ain't no need to talk, Squad!

Damn, damn, I swear these niggas in trouble
Pockets so fat that I can't walk, walk
I swear these bitches in trouble
So geek'd off that she can't talk, talk
These diamonds got me so turnt up
Yo bitch choosin me so how it's my fault, fault?
She feelin us so she think that she so turnt up
I told er get er shit and get out my houseEmbed
