10 ContributorsMore of That Lyrics
(Ear Drummers)

I'm so drunk that I can't keep balance
You stepping on my New Balance
I put sixes on my Charger
'Cause these niggas ain't no challenge
Kush coming in from Cali
Yeah, that's up my alley
I'm a dope-sellin' nigga, I'm a kush-smokin' nigga
Yeah, the shit run in my family (Yeah)
None of these niggas don't scare me (No)
Half of these niggas don't like me (So?)
Got me grabbing for my gun, got me going on the run
Got blood all on my Nikes (Nikes)
A lot of the hoes be striking (Striking)
Some of these hoes be trifling (Trifling)
Got a nigga in the trunk jumping out with the pump
And you came to the hotel icey (Brrr)
Took a dog to the fight, bet the dog gon' bite
I'll end a nigga life with a gun or a knife (Huh?)
I'll take a nigga girl, I'll fuck a nigga wife
If you do it in the dark, then it's coming to light (Bling)
Got the plug pullin' up to the park with the white (Skrrt)
On the Crest with a vest and a tech and a check
Don't do it the best, but I'll do it to the death
Don't need you to do it, I'll do it myself
You might also like
I called my chick and said "I need some more of that" (Mwah)
The way she put it on me, at a loss for words (Yeah)
I called my plug and said "I need some more of that" (Huh?)
A thousand pounds of herb and plus a lot of birds
I'm sipping lean, I'm 'bout to pour some more of that (Yeah)
I think I need about a thousand pints of syrup (Wow)
You make me mad, then I'ma fuck your hoe for that (For real?)
I got your bitch with me, I know your feelings hurt

Your bitch is with me and your bitch is a flirt (Ha)
Limpin' with pimpin' I know that it hurt
Took off her dress and I took her to dinner
Then took off my shirt and she took off her skirt
Smoking on purp and I brought out the vert
Hating on Gucci is making it worse (Yeah)
Your dick in the dirt and my goons on alert
And I wonder if this nigga can fill up a church (Wow)
All of my niggas still fuck with the work
Fucking with Gucci's a gift and a curse (Yeah)
Fell on her dress then I fell on her breast
If I'm feeling like that, then I fill up her purse (True)
Play with me, nigga, you ride in a hearse
Pay me and pull up, these choppers will burst
Hit in the head and I know that it hurt
Dead on arrival no need of a nurse (No)
You think that it's funny, you owe me some money
You niggas be' pay me my cash by the first
Fuck with my cheese and these 40s'll burst
Got a hole for you niggas real deep in the earth
I'm fucking your bitch, but she sucking me first (Yeah)
Roll me a blunt and I pour me some purp
Gucci the boss and your life has a cost
Play with my money, I blow up your house
I called my chick and said "I need some more of that" (Mwah)
The way she put it on me, at a loss for words (Yeah)
I called my plug and said "I need some more of that" (Huh?)
A thousand pounds of herb and plus a lot of birds
I'm sipping lean, I'm 'bout to pour some more of that (Yeah)
I think I need about a thousand pints of syrup (Wow)
You make me mad, then I'ma fuck your hoe for that (For real?)
I got your bitch with me, I know your feelings hurtEmbed
