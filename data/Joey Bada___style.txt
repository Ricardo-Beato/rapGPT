We done came up
Everybody love ‘em
On the regular
Lookin’ at popular colored faces
Observing what my brothers faces in all races
Lost in generations before hatred
See with your eyes dilated for the sake of the Gs
But keep it sacred G, fuck a rat race, we take the cheese
Jack cheddar from the make believe
Break the trees on they eighth CD
Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully
I’m a Brooklyn nigga, basically I grind with the grimiest
Learn how to eat in the jungle full of hyenas
And vultures, don’t worry what a verse will cost ya
From the young scorcher, just remember who taught ya
Imma spark it off unorthodox
Won’t sign to no major if no wager
Less than a 3 million offer off the top
I’ll be in a box with my coughin’ drops
Why settle for a office spot?
Niggas don’t always make it off the block
Unless they extort rocks or support the cops
They still snitchin’ - let me guess: that’s your mannequin?
Leave ‘em shook while you’re standing and quit the shenanigans
Have you panicking, induce damages ‘til you’re vanishing
Words are told properly, resort top sea examinin'
This is for my real hip hop fans and ‘em
I dispose for 'em, leave fake MC’s in the post mortem

Cause money ain’t a thing if I got it I won’t spend
All I got is my Pros, I don’t need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won’t sin
No he won’t give in
Yo this world is bone chillin’
Make meals in hell’s kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered drop trees in my swisher
And bring that back to my property wit ya

It ain’t easy being this royal
When you got this much going for you
It ain’t hard to be disloyal
Comin’ straight from the soil with lines that never coil
Start to think pretty off new career with this spoil
The kid is that sick so expect more coffins
I’m the chosen one so you can expect more offerings
I be sonning niggas so expect less orphans
Best rapper alive hear that line used less often
Word to God I’m the best offering
BMX like Hoffman, BMF like Boss-man
Young boss, man, got Jimmy Fallon endorsements
From porches, to Porsches, getting portions of fortune
They said next up so I stepped up
Fly like I dressed up
Bitches try to hang like left nuts
Like orangutans in the west of
Of the motherland, but I’ve got the swank of no other man
Brother man
They can’t understand
Pro Era boys pop rubber band
Cause money ain’t a thing if I got it I won’t spend
All I got is my Pros, I don’t need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won’t sin
No he won’t give in
Yo this world is bone chillin’
Make meals in hell’s kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered drop trees in my swisher
And bring that back to my property wit ya

Everybody love ‘em

Got the reggies from the Bush
Get lifted like a saint off the kush, man all my niggas push
So I always got the zipstock in the Ziplock
Stay lo, like Ralph lip stock, hit the Mary, won't kiss and tell
My lips locked but my grip's not so I pass it off
Real burners, and we ashing off your furniture
Fuck your couch, bitch, hush your mouth
She said she fell in one of them Ls, but lust don't count
These chickens don't love me, they love the account
But they will never know what's the amount, I keep the hoes in check
'Til they bounce, don't ever let a chick see you withdrawn
These niggas want to know what I draw with
But won't respond to what I've drawn
Tetrahedrons, take a dose of Patron
With knowledge juice and deuce Cubes of Metatron
They wouldn't hear the tone through a megaphone, let alone
Cella phone, but my line stay hella blown
Hella blown, hella blown

Yo Houston, we got a problem, copy
Four, five hotties in the lobby
Said that they can blow the rockets properly, but blow up spots and never stop
Like them aki's, they never get aqui to my property
Known around my city like George Pataki
Young Jason for them dollars in the mix like teriyaki
And round four, I force my large Versace
Over my big head, cause I don't live here, she getting too cocky
Won't spot me in no closet
I ain't like Kels and them
Her closet full of arm limbs and a skeleton

Better tell that doofus deuces before he catch a whipping
Hit him in his Charles Dickens and strip him for his Scottie Pippens
Cause it's all about the big pimping
Rob him for his Nixon, and then question him about his timing
Right here, it gets reckless, best advice is
To tuck your necklace, and put your arms right back into your Lexus
Cause G-Stone Crips, they ain't nothing
To flex with, and billy gang Pyru, they really on some next shit
So if I were you I would probably ride with two
No fool, not two dudes, two tools
As in deuce-deuce cause niggas jack you for your soul
And your new shoes and your jewels too
There's something about another nigga having shit
That have a nigga spazzing clips all up in your back and dip
Cause it's all about bagging the baddest chick
Stacking them chicks up in Saks Fifth
But word is bond, you been on
Word is bond, you been on29Embed

And we smoking, toking potent herb
Preaching spoken words that just might poke your nerves
Hope you ain't scared, my jeep go "Scrrrr"
I peep the obscured, and what ain't normally easy to observe
I swear I'm born abnormally absurd
If I give you a piece of mind, you've been disorderly disturbed
That's my word, flip similes and verbs, now I'm eating
Retreating for seconds and thirds, y'all niggas seasoned
(Oh, you salty)
Don't worry what we ate, you don't want that plate
I combine yours with mine quake, and make the earth shake
Supernatural disaster on you half-ass rappers
Pass the herb to an actual pastor, word to the black lip bastard
I drop knowledge like a Five Percenter
Every time I drop a line, it touch like five placentas
Schooling your offspring, drop heat all spring
And stay hot for five Novembers, I think y'all niggas lost me

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find
You might also like95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time

Instead of lead slugs, I spreads the love
Like a bed bugaboo does, I'm in the W with your lovable slut
I'm in the walls while you bugging her up
I'll do your girl like this beat, straight fucking it up
Y'all niggas nothing to us, this feels like nuttin' to us
Son, taught your daughter how to bust a nut for fun
Recollect and collect the funds
When she see the sun spit the proceeds when I cum
'99, 'til infinity beyond
Hold my peace full of energy 'til enemies be gone
Until then niggas in my vicinity gone
Peep the melody we on
But they don't know the remedy to these songs
Basic necessities on how to be put on
Cause they see my team, we strong, Beastcoast in your region
If you get dropped you can't rejoin, they wanna know
Whose shoulder we leaning on
But all we do is show them who we leading on

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find

Cause they will never stop for a young black male
Blackmailed in braille that means what he felt
And the very reveal could appeal
Put you on the Alcatraz trail or railroad to hell
Oh well, some of us is taught there is help
The other source is lost in all sorts of wealth
Uh, roots of all evil
The highest stars; Evel Knievel
I see through people's door, the world may never know
How my third pupil show, Incognito and cold needles flow
And I don't throw subs, I throw torpedoes
The Don, not Cheadle, this don got a Cornelius fro
Afro punk festivities
This for my negus that's lying with queens like Nefertiti
Waking up to pyramids and big kitties
Gold soul theory, but what is life really

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find

(Fuck You!)
I stand on the corner of the block slinging amethyst rocks
Drinking 40s of mother earth’s private nectar stock
Dodging cops, cuz’ 50 be the 666 and I need a fix of that purple rain:
The type of shit that drives membranes insane
Oh yeah, I’m in the fast lane snorting candy yams
That free my body and soul and send me like Shazaam
Never question who I am, God knows, and I know God personally
In fact he lets me call him “me”
And it's just like, 3:47 in the afternoon
And it just hit me like an epiphany
All these niggas is fucking wack
Yo

Yo, when did rap turn into a fashion show?
Too many makeup artists won't let their passion show
The anti-social mogul, havin' 20/20 visions
In needa bifocals, for your eyes dilated ojos
Open wide, never did I owe hoes
Suck a dick dilated, tell my old hoes
Hit my main bitch in the Poconos
I'm not Pinocchio, I never lied, I poke her nose
With the dopest dope, brand new Pablo, brand new God flow
It feel like, Escobar and Apollo
Swank apparel, I put a pic on the site ‘ya megabytes
Y'all niggas ticking me off like headlights
Get your head right, it all falls down
I bread right on the house
Eye was on 106 & Park and still on the couch like "bitch fuck Jacob"
I went to meet my maker, with 25 sacred stones
Told him save me a few acres

Is what get fake MC's infront of loose triggers
Can't knock the hustle though, I may just bust a jigga
And lookin' through my eyes, you can kinda get the picture
Mo money mo problems as you get notorious, inglorious, until you're a big Victorious, no show
Only way you get to see the kid is through a photo
Or  branded up logos, and the females come out at night
And when they find the pot a gold they strike, seducing me?
Wait y-y-yeah, you nice on the mic, yeah yeah, you lookin' right
Yeah, you just my type, yo

Her friend split and dipped, damn I should've seen this
I'm in a boobie trap and thats some clever ass cleavage

She said "You got clever speaking"
And after I'm done, I still got it leaking
I dipped off ‘cause knowledge a nigga is still seekin'

Defined by every line, niggas tryin' to outshine
We’re both number one enemies, yo it’s sad though

When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do
When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School
To the big games but you know just how i do

Adapted to these new ways of living, getting money and sinning
Go together like denims diamonds and women
Tryna balance it at once but keep hitting these blunts
Demons of lust, keep hinting they stunts when I'm drunk
What if I jumped off this cloud full of thinking aloud
Into a, pool of my sorrow and start sinking in doubt
Rethinking it out, 'cause tomorrow ain't ever promising
And ever blink it counts for a prophet who see deposits
But he ain't always see the positives
He used to live in poverty, Thinking probably
One day, he strike the lottery
'Cause dreaming big never been odd to me
And since a kid Ive been on a musical odyssey
I knew the day would come where I wouldn't be sorry in a pile of G's
Or probably be rehearsing a verse on the beach
Wait reverse in the speech
'Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly

I turn my dreams to reality
So, I burn green same time I burn calories though
I'm eating now in fact, I'm feasting now
No more mistreating, my miss is treated now
No more misleading mister leader now
Mister visa now, I got green and cards with no limits
Bad boy life but shyne with no diddy
But it's no biggie, I spread love the Brooklyn way
But when push come to shove I'm bout that Crooklyn wave
Shook for days, Don't ever judge a book by a page
That could be a cover up if you ain't looking that way
But what can I say, everything happens for a reason
Time will tell 'cause even fall lasts for a season
So keep on believing, you live and learn die and you teach
Another, piece of the pie and it's finally sweet
But reverse on the speech, 'cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly

When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now
King me like James straight out of High School

Said we done came a long way 365 bong rips later
Last year I ain't make no paper
All I earned was some kicks some snares from some haters
And some favors from some chicks that move there rumps like shakers
But what's that shit, I was tryna be the greatest
Upgrade to the grade A list, but all they do is degrade us
And it ain't to hard to be famous, Whats hard is sustaining
Remaining the same when stuff changing
'Cause I remember days at the bus station, waiting
Still had no patience, so niggas try to play him
Imaginary players, Imaginary playlist
I been your favorite before you even started playing it
Who’d of thought the day would come I wouldn’t be sorry
In a pile of g's, and rehearse a verse on the beach
But reverse on the speech
'Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly

When it rains it pours down
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now

Yo, with not a damn thing on my mind but this rhyme
And a matter of time to make this whole shit align
Like I planned out, nothing in life gets handout
Just stand out, ever since I hit the pot my vision panned out
Pressure boil 'til I'm fanned out, now we the popular band
So they can't keep their hands off of the man now
Invite 'em in, give 'em that S vitamin, baby Cham style
Got some Trini girl to soak it up, ShamWow!
Damn, child, you're killin 'em
Fillin' 'em, drillin' 'em with serums of pure noradrenaline
High blood feelin' like the thermostat cracked, left mercury spillin'
Your favorite rapper tryna earn stacks from nursery children
True emcees write a verse and rehearse it a million times
Just for the rebirth of a feelin' prime and golden
Shawty ask what I'm holdin', teasin' 'em
Know when the magnum blast eye squeeze magnesium
Used to be mad premature, now I'm mad premium
From lookin' up to niggas, to lookin' up niggas
Meetin' 'em, meetings with 'em
Give 'em a high pitch like curveballs and helium
Young scorcher trying to evolve like Charmeleon
Million, yeah, nigga, we tryna get a million

We don't say swag no more, we say swank
Yo, yo, hip-hop's a jungle

Uh, lost in his time, I'm just tryna get it like a boss in his prime
These fake niggas sublime, light for fine sights
Wishing we'll fortune but the price ain't quite right
The slice ain't quite ripe
Still pulling strings how I fly but I don't like kites
How they gon' treat Brooklyn's finest not as fine as diamonds?
And fine nice, surrounded by hard flow like Icelands
Now we getting icing, finances nice
And I don't like surprises, I like superb prices rising
It's the least I could do, these verses priceless
Rehearse in private, reverse her eyelid until she curse in silent (insolent)
Got a problem solve it, all my Pros solids
We all gon' dine and until then we mobbing
So don't push me, uh, I'm close to the pussy
Even closer to the knowledge, dropped out of college in advance
Then hit the ground running like it's ants in my pants
Honey, Pop was a bumbaclot and had a queen bee Mommy
Uh, I love her to the tissue, disrespect my blood and it's an issue
She like, "This you on the cover for real? Ah, you so official"
Now go ahead and buy you some shoes that really fit you
I know she always think of little me, but now I got big literally

Rock your socks and sockets out your knees
Fulfil your needs with similes non-similar
Spit that unfamiliar, put that on familia
If you love hip-hop, ladies, rub your papillas
And fellas beat they chest like they silverback gorillas
It's the new age, children of the crystal healers

Uh, just put it in the air
Light that loud and watch disappear here
Thoughts at the speed of light years, I could see the light
Yeah, this the right year made the flow, yeah
Clear and easy to steer in the space and time erasing fine
Amazing in the maze of clichés
Each day weighs out enlightenment
Niggas blacked out 'cause I got ultra violent
Now my wave lengths to the radio waves
Still keep it under pavements but not a ratio change
My patio the same, but I ain't even got to tell them that
Poppy leave them dimes at my welcome mat
Get high as heavens, hope he'll never come back
I'm like 5'11, but have angelic contact
The devil jealous in fact, 'cause I rebel the spells
With a letter to God, I swear you know me so well
This one time, I said, "Lord, would you help?"
Some short time after, see my music on the shelf
And of course, I gotta thank myself
My wealth is in my happiness and mind
And not my pocket health in its ashes
If you don't even think sometimes
If its passion let relationships synchronize
Drowning inside her, true eyes is to the higher

Kama Sutra, back to basics
Since I was on the go, back to the block
105 on, started bumpin’ Hard Knock
I looked at my nigga Fly, as my heart dropped
Sedan in front swervin’ as the car stopped
In that split second, my foot steppin’ breakin’
I thought to myself, I always knew that I would make it
All it took was patience, and now I’m on the stations
Luckily I made it right before my life was taken

People callin’ my phone, like they happy that we did it
Little did they know I was ‘bout to meet my maker

My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm

The only lady I can ever match bonds with
On some atomic bond shit, our love is plutonic
But I just can't put my foot on it
My one and my only, we not only lovers but homies
Whenever I'm lonely, right on time she arrives
She know the business for some minutes
I bury that kitty alive, oh no, I'm kidding but I really be in it
And we don't plan on having kiddies
But I really be skinnin', really be raw
They say sex is the weapon, love is really a war
And sometimes I feel threatened 'cause she really know all
My weaknesses, sometimes we fight, won't speak and shit
But we both know what the sequence is
It's like a never-ending cycle, something like your menstrual
The day you put your menopause, I'll pause the instrumentals
That dussace got me in the mental
Me and you until the end of time 'til we no longer existential

Right on time, you are my love
This ain't nothing like consistence, persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions

No, one man's clever, one knows no better
I like to go get her to keep her warm in cold weather
She blow below better then she goes for endeavors
Write our names on the clouds in bold letters
If hoes ever touch me, she load Berettas
But trust me, she's lusty, it must be me rubbin' it off on her skin
I can't budge her, a pen? I swear that her love is just a sin
We back at it again, fussin' and fightin', I start cussin', she cryin'
Break up to make up, I start cuttin' then slide it in
Then mix the vibe with some Hen, you got five, I got ten
Now we some trippy niggas as high as a fin
But what's your game, love? Already know it
We some ordinary people but extraordinary poets
Get lost in the Moet when I po' it
Fuck it if we drownin' in pain, 'cause we don't really show it

Right on time, you are my love

First I wake up, wake up, thinking of a plan to get my cake up, cake up
Cause I can't pay the rent with school papers
I need two acres and more
I know how it feel walking out the door pockets out of dough
Out it doe, be on the flow
We smoking indo, but we out though, adios
My audio getting me that Audi dough or the range rov
Mahogany colored clothing, my hog in the road
Drive slow, cruising down memory lane before I hit the streets
Have my melody playing, creators choose flight with my melancholy saying
Head between clouds, I think I'm married to Jane
I remember the days when I'd forever complain
That's way before they started paying, I was in pain
Sick in the brain like I never met a physicist yet
Only lyricist on my metaphysics intellect

Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of timing
And time's not rewinding, yeah

Round two bout, half of this loud through
Don't let them hounds snoop and get soundproofed
High frequency sounds too
Has statik spot over serious statik shots
Scrap vinyls over them statik pops
Im a fanatic fly but a sporadic guy
Never chat a lot, just pass the Lye and guide the youth
Stand with the truth, Nigga nothin' less
When the playbutton pressed
Killswitches feel it hit ya chest
And meet your death, if im caught on the fence know hell hit ya
Yes true vets keeps it real whichya
Ill wit ya, show you the real picture
Only keep the ones around that suffer for meals whichya
Cuz when them suckas, see ya supper
And your cake getting richer and your pockets getting thicker

Thats 100 on the real, no balance scales, still trippy
Where I live it's either you know talents well and sell records
Or no talent, well we still sell for the record
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the trap game
In fact is the exact same, and these tracks is my crack caine
And if you listening then you a fiend
Our music is the cure like some vaccines
Exotic to the core so stop asking
Got the blueprints to the game, but I read it as king
There's 47 ways to get this green
One is being an enslaved being, the other dreams
Red pill or blue bean, I can't sit still I'm too lean, nigga

This is from the real side

Yo, Badass don't act or pretend, back at it again
Hit it from the back, she a addict within
I got her on some shit like "I'm a get tatted for him"
She a ride or die, slim, when she in the denims
Remember it like it was yesterday
Another case of "I fucked your bitch, nigga" but a more clever way
Quarter in the room to elevate, said if you ever may
Slip then hit her on the hip where the Beretta stay
Catch me somersaulting my eyelids
Awakened from a dream, just perceived how I live
So it's make believe, rather unique
Lavish, sweet all live in a rapper physique
Hit up a show then after retreat back to the telly with freaks
Pack up a bowl and we ain't even eat
But we got a appetite for cookie creases and treats
And they all got tricks up they sleeve

I'm ashing on the bridge, Mary Jane, fuck your cigarettes
I'm laughing out loud, ask me if I'm still stressed, possessed
Hope the boys in blue don't arrest yours truly
Respect but suspect, protect your neck jewelry
47s and Uzis, well-connected and recruiting
I be with my Mexicans, I know they got the toolie
I'm smoking doobies with like 20 of my goons
Hotbox the whip and let smoke fill the room
Even through my lenses, my sense is on the moon
Dirty be the name and I came from the black lagoon
I'm sick with the ink like infected tattoos
Just one love but the two-three's branded on my shoes
You would think I had a eighth the way I'm crushing them grapes
Had her whining for a taste, that's why she's up in my face
Them Apex taking over like we running with Apes

Art what we drop, shopping cart with Da Vinci
Whimpering, leave that risk to your Pros
Wrist full of stone, lapidate if they pass me the smoke
I'm strapped and irate, daps from the fake
Get me mad and I contemplate irrational mode
Don't think about nada, strung you by your collar
The flow father who balanced out his chromosomes proper
I'm going home partner like Posada, they talk beef
But toss the ensalada, peep the blue Impala
There's arrogant cops who stay intruding
Can't stop the 47 like protagonist in Absolution
Them wack rappers who track-eluding
Critic is a random student who use the Era as a new rap influence
Faster than ransom shootings or some cancer fluid
I still kill and you can't lose it15Embed
After that day my nigga
I remember when he came back to school 3 weeks after
Gave that nigga a bible
And I was like "Yo wherever you go, take this shit with you
You feel me, and you gon' be good
Like I can't, cause you my friend and I can't protect niggas"
Like all I can tell niggas is sit n' pray and that's it
But niggas be taking their life for granted like
You know being on some wild cowboy shit, you can't
You got beef with some nigga like, don't be in their vicinity my nigga…
I feel it
Soul music

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way

Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Tell me what the fuck an angel does
We're seeing kids who ain't aged enough
Getting high off angel dust
From NY to Los Angeles
There ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Looking where they car be at
And they party at
Cardiac arrest can feel risky
Real pissy I chase cheese and real pussy yeah
Cats used to yawn on his rap now look at 'em
Shit ain't been the same since them niggas started booking 'em
Pull up with your pen up, looking sharper than a bulletin
With pin stripes and hollow tip bullets in it
He's something that you'd invest in
Catch him live on late night, but he ain't interestin'
Pop up and poop out something like intestine
No corrections cause the mic been checked in
The only time he be asking is when he sexing
My team like teenage mutants and X-men
Fire spark when I step in
He the human torch
Inhaling fumes of all sorts of course
Steez taught me how to store it in my ball shorts
So when we stop by the D we never get caught
I say it again we face L's but never lost

And they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand
But don't understand they the only one who gets the benefit, damn
Sometimes I just sit and pray
They couldn't walk this way in my J's
It wouldn't feel despair, but disarray
Like their souls disappear
Son got hot flows, got dropped like disarray
Couldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed
Covered with Ray-Bans, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!
Even through shades of black
I see brighter days looking back in fact
So I relax my mind, see what these tracks can find
A gold mine that will make me rich in both dimes in mine
Gotta make it all mine if you don't mind

Lives the vicious ways where they spit and spray
Vicious trey's coming for the ice you kept in yesterday
It's nothing but the history
Protecting ya' from being history
And then the next day your face is just a mystery
For niggas who really ain't feeling me are all my fucking enemies
Even the lightest hours requires heavy artillery
Accelerate without the breaks of a break
And still I'm not eating up to now and there's a lot on my plate
All in a day's work of God and his grace
You wanna eat then tell God and say grace
And avoid the heat getting the boil to surface
A soft nigga caught between these rocks and a hard place
Because the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface
But the ill-minded child, is ill minded child
Got a round of styles
Killing niggas' mental like a round of shells
Very well rounded, round it well 'til the highest number
Praying that 2047 ain't the highest number
Sometimes I just sit and pray

Said I don't know why do I live my life this way

Shit, my eyes low
(Hey, what's up nigga *echo*)

It's only one way this can work out
Drop down, I'mma give you twenty if you scurred out
You scurred now, call me the drill sergeant
Charge in the apartment like a charger compartment
I'm in the walls now, I'm wired up
So now the higher ups is trying to quiet us, uh
Smoking on land, lord I light it up
Just gettin fired up, now she coming like a fire truck
She threw the towel in, score for me oh for she
Cause she keep howlin' we showdown like Shaolin
Slow down for an hour then, sink it deep into the shallow end
How you like beef girl? Keep swallowing your food
I'm following your mood and it's blue and me too
But I can't lie like I blew this green on you
I blew it on the purple fume and I know I read your mind, right
You're bright, you want green of all types like limelight
Balance is the kiwi fused in the tunes
Third eye sight, she rodent the car with three blind mice
They chase cheese and don't think twice
And for that, some niggas in the cut get sliced
She looking back
Now, cause she ain't met a nigga as real in the back
Down as shack she throw it back for that, willingly
She hope I catch children
But the mag sheilding, in other words I wrap feelings

You on that third eye shit, Huh?

It’s all illusions, fixed gear cruising
Fixed reality shrouded from governmental pollution
I ain’t a saint, the holy ghost up in my aura rebuked it
It’s the era of indigo and they go with the preaching
I ascend as the seasons, go on and I vanish
Cause I notice I’m slowly becoming way more imbalanced
A king with the crown, firm grip on the chalice
Solid gold angel coming back to burn down this Babylon
Has told many tales, his flows you could sells
Mastering wind elements, I move with the gales
‘Cause I’m a socialite in the night, bitch get right enable
I’m boxing yo dorm, put my Nikes on the coffee table
My tongue’s below her navel, she makes it wet, her skills are naval
Seals my hands on her extremities, we’re chopping up these remedies
Came in between her and I
We leave it to the constellations like should we continue relations?
I think not cause all I do is smoke pot
And make beats, and yo ass just want back shots

When I release the flows I goes over yo dome far
The nigga to represent the barrio, we hold bars
I shine further, you sons get in the bogart
You gotta pick yo road, give it a go, keep the point, God
Better with the regis my mind, they manifesting
Beast coast, yea we the pros, you don’t wanna mess with
We leave you breathless, don’t second guess the best who blessed it
Less than yo adolescence when I speak my progression
Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

This is what I asked for, asked for
Chilling at my back door, back off, mind tweaking on bath salts
Confuse my intelligence, maybe I’m irrelevant
So eloquent, being riders with a elephant
The higher rank tryna pull a trump card
When I try and do the things, I deserve all respect
Intricit my amount, boy to any amount
To any account, probably I gets em out uh
I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I can see it through the pyramids
I must admit, I must admit

The mental state with a nigga that was penciled for great
Following schedules, never scheduled for break
But still embrace he'll put ya' neck in a brace
Regular days went to getting paid regular
Respecting the Era where the Era’s been ascending up
Got all types of fans that’s always sending us love
And ex girls that I loved I now offend with a glove
And stayed deeper but still heading above
‘Cause Mr. Hinds always gotta float to let the people know that nigga head is above
Regular sea height, cause they 3rd eye never seen height
Cause only this Brooklyn street light gave me shine to shine for these nights
Came with the free ice to bag bodies on the beat sipes
Bring it down baby
Bring it down baby, uh

Looking for who’s in charge, don’t be shocked, I’m the plug
Get inside like the socket, the surgeon, the sergeant
Energy – I put all in
I’m learning the flaw things
In the storm you stand out, you can struck and stand up
I know how to conduct, feelings electric
Well we’re connected, your buttons are pressing
Can test the reception, I sent you a message
Let me know if you get this, the question

Seen it all in the retrospect, took retro steps
Like it’s ’93 still, got ’93 til mic skills
Even got the ecko check
Like for real there no testing, my tribe is not some Tribe called Questions
My professions are not no seconds
To no veterans and they minutes of fame
I’m a menace, insane, minus the brain as I diminish the flame
Make it rain, champagne, 'til it falls down the drain
Got my head up in my dreams
Everything ain't what it be seemin'
Don’t blame me girl, blame my semen
You got good jeans so your inseams made seamless
And off top, you’re ingenious
We took a hit of of the greenest
Now she at most fear on the atmosphere but don't intervene us
Break her body down to the genus if she leaving
She didn’t get the pic and now I see Sophia
She get the tone, sorry Bonita but

And the green stuff turned to slime, and grime
Everybody want to be your blood cousin
When you're buzzing
Fine, I give 'em my other line, another rhyme
Word to mother, I'm goosed up
My two fucks in two cups
Another double entendre
She fell in that Bombay
Now she tumble dry lingerie
Chardonnay nothing but the bottle of emotion
But the love potion when it sprays
They just caught up in the days
Let me show you how I feel these Jays
The cheese stays high like Dr. J
My flow is like land the boats, dock the planes
Hand the dope but cop the chains
For more fiends some antidote to stop the pain
Now my stream, floods these streets
They can't stop the reign
All right I need them back

Just smoking drinks both the broken in-glass like old English
Are you good bro?
Is your eyes dilated from the kush 'n Nuvo?
This new for the life
Like a Nubian with the doobie cold eyes
Better smell the coffee I'mma coughing
That means I'm sick widdit, spit it out
Kill it like airborne diseases
Is this why the rap game is this easy?
Like please eat your vegetables
So I took a dose of the edible
Ain't an overdose
Already a rap monster fucking overload
Hopping up on stepping stones

Come and hear the blunt-smoking philosopher
Smoking with a joint to get you open like a chakra
No time for the roster this rap game goes either way
Let him lead the way
And niggas will know who they need to play
Freeing the ways to amplify the idiolect
Saw nothing but shots since the project days
Like I was eyin' the Tec
Kept the eye in the text
Make 'em see my eye in the Lex
Giving my blood sweat and iron injecting selecting the soul
Cause mind body and soul can't be reinstalled
Special with the flow to make Niagara fall
It's over for the systematic rapping robotics
Crashing my logic
These niggas hooked on hooks and Hooked on Phonics
With hooked on phonics the pot could get em hooked on chronic
Cause pain conditions from the page conditions
Racing like Sonic inhaling the tonic
They couldn't grade my brain in a college
Themes behind it rob you for ya mind like thieves is behind it
So we had to squeeze in knowledge
To pile it when the green sees wallet
Anything to let the green seize wallet
Taking forever and a century with sentence speeds
Like a penitentiary to build cell blocks to block your memory
Catch me on the enemy's territory
Telling terrorist story with a terror
The Era ends with a good night story

Three K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today that's worthwhile
Will for sure inspire actions in your first child
I'll begin my verse now

Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
I feel my ancestors unrested inside of me
It's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle
They built for us
The first step into change is to take notice
Realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier
Obama just wasn't enough, I need some more closure
And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over
Let’s face facts 'cause we know what’s the real motives

I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action, hold up, yeah, uh
Trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison
All our history hidden, ain't no liberty given
We all fit the description of what the documents written
We been lacking the vision and barely making a living
We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'
Every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it
The Lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness
Put opiates in syringes then inject his religion
How many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission
Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission
A human with super vision, ain't no livin' condition
I'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen
Start a new coalition against corrupt politicians
It's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions
Another family evicted, another black man a victim
That's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors

Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

Why you can't recognize my stride?
Always gotta minimize my pride
Always gon' criticize my moods
I can't make one mistake, it's no room
Feelin' like I gotta leave real soon
I'ma say, "Namaste," and just bloom
But for now, let you run away from the truths
Since you can do anything you want to, anyway, uh
Know some things I ain't supposed to know
It's way deeper than just bein' emotional
Some things you just couldn't keep on the low
Now I'm free, by the truth, I can't be controlled, no more
Nothin' like I used to be back before
Know it must hurt for you to see me evolve
Why you gotta kick me down on all fours?
Why you can't stand to see me stand tall?
Tell me why we got a war?
Why we gotta fight? Why we always gotta spar for?
Why the cops always gotta get called?
Why you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?
I guess some things will never change
Locked in the cycle, tryna break the chains
Handcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins

Now, what's freedom to you?
Let’s talk about it, take a minute, think it through
I'm all about it, but the concept seems new
The coppers still shoot us down on Channel 5 news
Lock us up for anythin' we do to pay dues
Some of us woke while some stay snoozed
Zombies walkin’ around trippin' over issues
The knowledge is official but it's often misused
America my masseuse, massagin' my back
Tryna act like, she ain't gonna do me like Pratt
Geronimo, take a leap and lay flat
I'm down to go for my message to spread across the map
Holy cross on my back got a bullseye on it
I gotta get stoned to fulfill my moment
Oppress my oppressor, suppress the opponent
Channel my ancestor, he wouldn't condone it
In search of the healin' component
Said you would notice
If you took notice, but you too nosey
Time to wake up
Won’t you come and smell the hot coffee?
Stick your nose in the wrong places, one day you’ll OD
I swear the whole world owe me
I'm nothin’ close to the old me
If you never knew me, then it's too late to be homies
Homie, say fuck what you told me
I'm ridin' out by my lonely
Waitin’ for the day the big homie take these chains off me

I don't wanna be good, nigga, I'm tryna be great
It’s hard when your back's against the wall
And if you got it all to keep your feet up on the floor
So I thank the Lord when I wake up in the morn'
'Cause to inform the world the very reason I was born
You can see the power when the mic is in my palm
When I storm across the room, hit the stage and perform
Word is bond, don't be alarmed
Don't let me have to sound the horn, and drop a bomb
Wanna get my mom a crib, with a lawn
Somethin' that my future kids, can run up on

Still swervin’ on these city blocks, for one thing
My man just copped a 30 shot, protect the team, know what I mean?
Music is a form of expression
I'ma use mine just to teach you a lesson
Rule one: this microphone's a weapon
I'm shootin' out the actions manifested and my passion
Never restin', I'm surpassin' the expectancy
Of life in my direction

Peace to my Slimes, and peace to my Crips
Neighborhood police and they always on the shift
Protect my Bloods, look out for my cuz
When it's all said and done, we be the realest there was
Who else if just not us?
If you 'bout this revolution, please stand up
We ain't got no one to trust
Time is running up, feel the burn in my gut
And if you got the guts, scream, "Fuck Donald Trump"
We don't give a fuck, never had one to give
Never will forget, probably never will forgive
Uh, I guess that’s just how it is
And they still won't let the Black man live

Feel the energy surge through my veins when I flow
Mentally, I can never be controlled
No sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed

With the fake, look me in the face, eyes of the storm
You don't want none
No beef could never hurt me
I be on my Istanbul, they cold turkey
Firstly, it's the double entendre monster
Takin' haunted constant trips through your conscious
So be cautious
If it call for it, we leavin' corpses
The causes of the coffin is the broken clauses
Skeletons in my closet, tomorrow's never promised
Never mind it because we immortals regardless
Real G's move in silence like my designer
Intertwined with the timeless, divine higher powered
I was drippin' in the gold since a minor
Sittin' on my throne, overlookin' my empire, uh, uh

What you think I do it for? My brothers under a spell
It's clear we livin' in hell, the life of a black male
Right out the womb, you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail
Just waitin' for you to fail, a special room in the jail
With your name, a number on it so you property now

Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light

This is legendary, it's never secondary
I'm getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary
I kill my enemies by any means necessary

Amerikkkan Idol, one hand on my bible, one hand on my rifle
I'm aimin' at my rival, sure to leave him dead on arrival
They say it's all about survival, never lackin' the vitals
So I came to kill the game and still gave it revival
I'm coming for the title, man it's best you throw in the towel
Last nigga who tried to vio, now facin' a trial
I'ma be here for a while, gettin' richie like Lionel
Now she all up in denial 'cause she gettin' the dial
While I'm only gettin' better, so she back on my D now
I wanna be down but she denounced
I got my shot, then made her, bounce
Now you tryna rebound, I'm livin' in the now
While the future figure me out
Told mommy pick a place, yo, and we out
'Cause Bed Stuy a little unsafe for me now
That's why I keep the .40 loaded with no safety around
Never thought I'd have to hold it, I'm just holdin' it down
Protect my neck and my crown, patrol throughout the town
And they judgin' just 'cause my skin color is brown
And for that, they wanna leave me dead in the ground
And have the nerve to blame it all on my background
Sorry white Amerikkka, but I'm about to black out
Got a message for the world and I won't back out
So turn the kid raps loud, I'm about to spazz out
Watch out, another nigga runnin' in the White House
But I won't stop 'til this whole shit painted in all black
And we on top, 'cause my people been paining before crack
Media's got this whole thing tainted, that's all fact
Feedin' you lies like this whole thing wasn't built on our backs
Assimilate our history then made it a mystery
Now they all inherit the bittersweet victory
Look at what they did to me, can I get a witness please?
Justice never served, reparations never sent to me
It's clear who the enemy, they declare war on the end of me
Assassinate my character, buryin' my entity
But they can't kill my energy, so when it's said and done
They forever gon' remember me
The fuck is you tellin' me?
Fuck is you tellin' me?
Way more than a celebrity
And fuck white supremacy, huh

This that Bada$$-assination
Topic of conversation, my proclamation to the nation and its congregation
Been makin' observations like it's my occupation
Debatin' speculation like it ain't just second nature
Thou shall love thy neighbor, don't let that nigga hate you
'Cause he know where you lay up, when it's karma, time to pay up
Climb the ladder of success, I'm steady on my way though
Devisin' plans while you sleepin' I'm just tryna stay woke
You leave me no choice, I'm about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice
Yeah yeah yeah
I said leave me no choice, about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice
What the government is doin' amongst our people is downright evil
Disturbin', but not surprisin', that's for certain
With all of the conflict of propaganda, I believe they are simply tryna slander
Start a Civil War within the USA amongst black and white and those alike
They are simply pushin' us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it
They want us to rebel, so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails
Alton Sterlings are happenin' every day in this country and around the world
The scary part, boys and girls
Is most of these stories don't make it to the news and reach mass consciousness
It is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement
And accomplishment of what we call human rights
It is time to rebel, better yet, raise hell
I just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it
Because this is all part of the government's plan and what they been plottin'
They're literally beggin' for this to happen, so they can kill us off
Usin' uprisin' and rebellion as the excuse in a timely fashion
The cancerous foods, the chemical warfare, economic sufferin' is not workin' fast enough
There are many steps ahead of us and manifestin' the future that they want
We have to work together, not only rattlin' them on a physical plane
But to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same
As black men, I think our gangs need to do a better job at protectin' us
The people, our communities and not assistin' in destroyin' them brutally
It's time to even the score
'Cause who do we call when the police break the law?
We are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another
But not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other
The code words to killin' a black man by police is, "He's got a gun"
Damned if he do, damned if he don't, damned if he runs
Or what about them? Them murderers got it
We need solutions, you better start plottin' now
It's always been clear that they don't value our lives
My people been sufferin' way too long
And I'm tired of singin' the same old song
People actin' like this shit isn't happenin', it's downright wrong
Justice won't be served by a hashtag, and that's the very reason I ask that
What are we to do? We're scattered around
With no clue of this ugly truth
All we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed
Time to wake the fuck up and do our own research
And not form opinions based on just what we've heard
Ameri-K-K-K-a is force feedin' you lies down your throats with a silver spoon
And eventually, we'll all be doomed
Real, real, real soon42Embed

Let's get it

And here's an ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

I could never forget them gloomy days
Although I regret where my time was placed
If I could go back, some things would be changed
And I would know that, for a fact, it was fame
That drew me to this unfamiliar side of my brain
That withdrew me from familiar and the closest remains
Although I'm gaining ends now, I'm losing friends
They say that time is money, and my time is well spent
Girlfriend hit me up to chill, but does this shit make sense?
And I don't expect for you to know if you ain't paying rent
I got to make this album, and hold it down for my camp
Surrounded us all like bonfire
When I lay a verse down that's more fire, I was born fire, uhh

Old man no longer snoring, snoring, ah
The rain just won't stop pouring, pouring, uh
What's heaven's capitol like, like, li-like?
Maybe I can crash tonight, night, night
Cause I'm trapped inside this hell, hell, hole
God, please answer your cell, cell, phone
I'm coming home tonight, can't touch no microphone tonight
Outside my comfort zone tonight
My brain's blown out my dome tonight
Tonight's the night, don't you try to put up a fight
Don't you trying looking for light
Cause I'm bout to take that flight

Indigo father, meant to go farther
And travel across the water and pocket a million dollars
I am the spirit, I am the guava
You sippin' out of your coconut beverage in the Bahamas
Pardon me mother, pardon me father
I'm glad that you split apart it was part of my firestarter
Along with niggas, bitches, and ballers
And people that look down on me like they so taller
I go harder, I grow smarter
The flow's water, like Osama
Oughta gropple every dollar, every single piece of change
Move into the woods so I'll never ever change
Lose a couple friends but I'll never ever change
I probably miss some money but I never ever change
And they can say whatever but I never ever change
I feel I understood why the stars went insane
Ummmm brain battered from scattering every Saturday
Pitter patter with people that really matter
And I'mma fuck up regardless cause I'm a kid right?
That's why you can't spell summer without trouble
Stripper with no bubble, threesome with no double
Love without hate, life without pain
This without that, choice without thought
A dog with no day, a Seattle without rain
If it rains in Seattle
I'll saddle up and then you can ride with ya nigga
Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga
Vibe with me nigga, say vibe with me nigga
Say, if it rains in Seattle

You don't want to see the evils, which I dwell in hell
To excel, this shit never fails, always excels
They been swallowing sons before the double XL
Sex cell, ex ask why it never work out
I guess I exercise too much, when I work out
Shows too turnt out, return home burnt out
Now I got to hear all the shit, that you heard 'bout
Can I live? What, these niggas want me off a bridge?
If I say it's turnt down, do I burn that shit?
Truth is, if it ain't real, I don't feel it
If it don't hit my spirit, I don't get near it

Yeah, so gullible just like my first love
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up
Picked up the pen, and that's when I drew my first blood
Spill my heart again, 'cause the pain'll never end
Happiness is temporary, always has been
I just lost one, but sometimes, I win
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end
Always kept like 47 friends in my circumference
All that’s left now is the radius
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere
This is my moment of truth, right here
Swear I ain’t scared of no man, I see the omens
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'
The omnipresence is omnipotent
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done

And read: "Here lies a G," followed by a poem (Oh, oh)
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling wrong
Went with both shoulders that my head is always on
I charged through harm's way, carried boulders on my arms (My arms)
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms (Many storms)
That rain on my parade, seen the doves cry for days
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gates
Though Steezy told about me, yo, I know he always watching
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip-hoppers
I really miss my partner
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2Pacs, and a big L, rolled proper

So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
I’m not eating, not blaming, I’m just saying
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking
They too fake
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty
Long as Rawle and Whitney seen different cities, different titties
All with no money with me

It's all a hidden  history of mysteries
I see vividly, hysteria
Cause misery on the interior
As shit get more scarier, I'm never in fear
Just a little inferior in some areas
But I share, wisdom with Sumerians
Somewhere we in the place
Peace means harmony, not war and armory
But fuck that, cock your gun back
This survival of the fittest
Some cats get boxed in where they litter
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in the trap
Get smoked out and I ain't talkin' bout what you toke out
You choked out for really thinkin' that this shit is a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't actin' on the scene, niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well-schemed
I'm tryna' have wealth for my well-being
By eighteen, pockets healthy green
What the fuck is twelve beans?
I need the cake and cream
The stakes is high like feens off a dream jet streaming
Having cuisines with the best seasonings
Its the vets season
Carry a vest, you know the reason
I'm in Chi-raq and I'm getting blown like the breezes
The chicken strip teasers
Thighs, legs and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I ain't got a bow and arrow

Overdose on high fructose, royal toast till I’m overthrown
And over-slowed, I been speakin' over tones
Low but keep them L's high, legends live long
And we gon' be forever, this for the Era
They tried to tell us we too deep in the flow
The mo' the better, the mo' clever, et cetera, whatever
Why do they sweat us?
Dead us, they just met us, but they won't forget us
They don't know better than the worst case
I be headed for first place
Purchase they position cause they worship our position
But I too had no pot to piss in, and so spot on in this instant
And they still ain't got my decision, I won't stand under no man
Except my high supplier, he got the fire, I got the lighter

Money ain't a thing if I got it
Mo—mo—mo—mo—mo
Money ain't a thing if I got it
Money—Money

Before the money there was love
But before the money it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough, yo

Sittin' back plottin', jottin' information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still plantin' plantations, we keep buyin' in
Closed-minded men, pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and
Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava, with just a penny I could
Multiply my worth and make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same since Biggie smacked me at my christenin'
Watch what you dishin' and please play it safe
'Cause your position on the top is switchin' right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep duckin' down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose, foes
Keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them, the Pros been on a mission, listen
Enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' MACs, I raise stakes to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS, "Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis, I got"
Dreams sellin' arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm crackin' a Serena

Like, "Oh, he's broke! I told you he was broke!"
Word. 
"I told you he ain't got no money!" or, you know, this and that, or whatever, whatever, then you'll see some other people, you'll put that you're here in this house: "Oh, Joey done made it! He bought a crib! He this, he that."
Word, haha. 
So it's all a story, it's a perception that people make for you, along the way. So it's not really what it necessarily is at any point in given—in time, and that's the thing that concerns me.

First things first is I been rehearsing these verses
In hopes that I hit the surface and keep myself afloat
But I know one day I'm earning me some platinum and some gold
And all them labels could just reimburse this dick in they throat
And tell my mama "Oh no," your purses will never run low
No more cause back when I was four, and we was poor
You would purchase the store
So here I go, your little man has got to grow
I'm walking out the door
My mama just be smiling cause she know
I got my back, ain't gotta worry
Only thing she ask is that I hurry
Home in time for Christmas for some dinner (Some dinner)

How I made the pussy dance?

We could call that magic
Say poof and our boots is tappin'
The sweetest taboo you practice
The sweetest juice that I have sip
I was raised by the Sycamore tree
I was told not to bite every apple I see
But somehow that's hard for me
Shorty make it clap, make it hard for me
Come grab the mic, spit a bar for me

We get high and say "Fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "Fuck the police"

They put this mic on trial cause he be killin' now
Forever bitin' my forbidden style
Been laying low for a minute in the game
Since I came all these niggas lookin' timid
My light could never dimith, the Lord is my shepherd
Jesus woke a devil in him since sinnin' with least effort
Thinking back to those lefferts days
And I ain't been the same since I left 6th grade
My mind strayed, used to have the biggest heart
Taking walks with abuela in the park, I used to tell her
I'ma grow propellers one day and be a good fella
Play the hero or whoever, the hood gon' tell us
Let's just pray it ain't the villain
Till then I be feeling some way
Thinkin' I can get the Maybach off gun play
Instead I let the words play with 90 beats a minute
Bet the streets lose a heart beat before the verse finish
But life goes on, basic rules still apply
Bet you can feel that line in any hood you live by
From Flatbush to Figg side, I was a schoolboy too
Hoppin' trains, I just missed my Q

And I guess we them little black beetles
This won’t attract the singles
And that flow is mean, but it lacks tacs and needles
I spend my days sharpening my skill wills while it's still legal
Reading through cathedrals applied to my cerebral
They ain't built they feeble, driven by the ego
The vision of a eagle, see the vision in my people
How many lives will they take today? We ain't equal
Another world war sequel and doomsday prequel
This ain't the world we thought it was when we was in pre-school
Sometimes it's hard to be cool, sometimes I feel like I'm see-thru
Sometimes I really wish, yo I wish that I could be you
Away from all the Hollywood acts and record contracts
I won't say I take it back, because I worked hard for that
But this life ain't turn out to be what it seem

I swear all my life I been around crips and bloods
Grips and slugs, the trigger happiest thugs
Claiming the slums, and all the hoods that they from
Too much of the sum, got it twisted up blinded in a rat race
Cash straight, the fake kill jake, the snakes too late
My eyes dilate, and I could tell them how he strafe
Coming at me sideways, get straighten up
Don't deflate it up gimmie the bucks my cash wrinkling up
Looking back in the days
Amazed 'cause the lab rat done made it out the maze
Still feel caged, enraged though
Used the underground railroad like a runaway slave
Broke off the chains still runway fresh
Got you on that mental plane with my project jet
I'm two steps above that nimbus cloud
My limit is low, when I'm smoking on that loud

Tell me what them know bout the Badmon named Jozif
Women come around, I look em down like they don't know shit
Word around the town is that they got the match explode it

I'm a child of the city
Son of the streets
And it's just a pity
They not tough like we
And things not look pretty
When we got to eat
Things get much deeper
Deeper and deeper
The belly of the beast

And I survive, thank the father
Feel like I was raised by Clans One Order
Had to keep calm and hold ma corner
Cause a stray gun shot if you cross the border
Pro Era teach them the pros and cons
Of living in a city with a thousand dons
A thousand ghetto youths with a thousand guns
Cold hearted killers with frozen lungs
But praise rastafari we wheel and come again
Know I Nyabinghi sit know we the drummer dem
Dem ammunition are tougher we power dem
Lightning and thunder a devour them
Pro Era teach them the pros and cons
Original Chronixx and Joe Badmon
No King Selassie, we have the golden crown
Get ready for the shift we are the chosen ones
I'm a child of the city, city, oooh

Son of the streets
And it's just a pity
They not tough like we
And things not look pretty
When we got to eat
Things get much deeper, oh no
Deeper and deeper
The belly of the beast

I'm a child of the city, city, oooh city
The belly of the beast
Been get real ugly

Now every man has to stand on his own two feet
You have to love you have to dove tougher than a concrete
It's them to you a white sheet oh dear

These are the only-child blues
The only-child blues
The only-child who? Yo, yo, yo
Back once again—hello, it's yo' favorite mellow schizo
The pavement on this yellow brick road fuckin' up my mental
My mood just like the tempo
Heartbeat, that instrumental
I never lack potential, every track is essential
Every project is special, abundant and fundamental
Give a fuck about hundreds as long as it's for my mental
With wisdom from what I've been through
Knowledge that some can't get to
Understanding that college is only out for a nickel
We could all be so simple, tune it to the metronome
This how I used to feel back on the metro home
Fresh outta class I knew these days, they wouldn't last
Just a stepping stone I gotta pass, another story for the lap
But fuck it, give him glory when he crash
He gettin' revved up, heads up and he's coming fast
He paved the lane before the cash
They tryna swerve me out of that
But I don't just got speed, nigga, I handle my ass
Pedal to the gas, life is but a getaway dash
My mama stash guarded by my pen and pad
I'm drawin' weapons with the raps
You shoot, I shoot back—no questions asked
Raise your hands for the realest cat alive
(Cat alive, cat alive, cat alive, cat alive...)

And I remember sittin' in my room all alone
Staring at my ceiling fan, getting in my zone
Mama was never home
Woke up one morning; Papa was gone
Young and lost so I ease my mind to popular songs
And of course I sold my mind to music
Writing everything I thought
Started openin' my mind, then I send it abroad
They don't know what my ascending has caused
My third eye been blinking since
Irv Gotti been inking murderous thoughts
At least that's how Irv gotta be thinking
If I'm takin' a loss and I'm better next week
And I'm never weaker
Never sinking on the fucking deep end
Any shit I missed I prolly peeped it

(Like, you know, it's fast living)
These are the only-child blues (It's not necessarily living)
The only-child who?

Yo, only-child blues—O-C-B, O-C-B

Headed north west, that two seater Kardashian

And keep ya head up, that 2Pac blasting
Face two sacks and then we back into this action
No time to relax, I need someone to count this cash with
That match with, give me what I'm askin'
The lady in the streets, a pure beast on that mattress
That's it, you're the only one I'm trying to mack with
But you could be a liability or fat ass-et
How real is that ass miss? Bend that shit backwards
Hit one backwood, crack the pussy like a password
Bet that pussy's last word is master
Ask her, rode my rocket til I made that astronaut
That's NASA'S thought, be that young fly, nasty one
Swallow the seeds, please, but you can't catch me slipping, hon

Niggas don't want war, I'm a martian with an army of Spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right, your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite, I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got 'em niggas P.E. nuts, like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate, though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Y'all collect pesos, your money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they Lightyear, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit, time to inaugurate
My P.E. conglomerates, 'bout to P-E-E on any wanna-B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty, congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be Simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of Theodora
My heart go, "ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom-boom"
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raised that 'K
Like every day in every way, and everywhere you go just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say to you is, "Pray"
'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and catch you slippin'
Another victim, don't know what's hit them—through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life

Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell 'em that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Start spitting fire, 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author, I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics

Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzis 'cause it's given to 'em

Yeah, you remember back in the days
When niggas used to rock waves and shit?
When like, yo, I had the fucking 360s, my nigga
Like nobody in the hood was fucking with my shit
And that's real shit

Since '95 momma been working nine-five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the gods, the Jahs and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives
'Cause all we tryna do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
'Cause these niggas these days is loco
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul
And I'm hopeful that me spittin' it soulful
Will have me in the Daily Postal, flying coastal, eatin' tofu
Like I told you, I know niggas who trash rappin'
Worried bout the trendin' fashions rather than ascendin' passion
They want me send 'em tracks but I just send 'em laughter
Right after I start laughin', they start askin' "What happened?"
But back to the chapter
Momma told me "follow dreams", should never have to ask her to
So that’s what I do, became an MC master
Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead, ask 'em "Who is Joey Bad?"
Watch 'em gasp, asthma, damn, it’s so sad
He paused the chatter 'cause he know he rather back up
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
'Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found in your retinal
Uh, and they told me not to be so complex
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex
And The Source — alfredo, of course
There I go again, steppin' out of line, runnin' off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north
Speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless with some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss, no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes

Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like three times, have three kids
I hope me and my wife can show 'em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge
'Cause yeah, they gon' need it
'Cause when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, till I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, my punishments, they grew more crucial
Should use the word brutal, 'cause my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib
Go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine
Imagine, I'ma make it all happen

Time waits for no man, life is but a two-step, slow jam

But God blessed the kid with many talents, he was chosen
It's why you see him livin' in the moment
Every second, gotta own it
'Cause you never know when could be your last
Time breathin', now you bleedin' from the gun blast
Then you thinkin' 'bout the past, see your whole life in a flash
Best friends lowerin' your casket, now your son a bastard
Pressure on his shoulders make him gotta grow faster
Wherе I'm from, the stories nevеr end with no happily ever afters (Uh)
Just broken families forced to start new chapters
A natural disaster, the cycle in a loop
And we caught up in a rapture
Not to mention all the other factors
Government agendas against rappers
They wanna see us either dead or captured

Shit, I could talk about any type of stuff with him
Never gave a fuck about who didn't fuck with him

Niggas on the streets is wylin', he look to God but can't find Him
So he demand silence from the glaring sirens
The sympathy symphony, only thing playin' is the banned violence
No lyin', niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn your molecules until you let go ions
Treat beef like they let go lions, so don't eye 'em
They get the wrong message, wrong methods put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure, God bless ya when the semi wet ya
They told me, "more dress-up", I'm giving too many lectures
And I'm puttin' in too many effort in my nouns and verbs

Smokin' on the Clematis, get open like a present is

Stay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead

Now
If I ain't know no better
I could have been sucked right up into the setup
But I kept my head up
And every time I fell I would get up
See I don't need no nines and Berettas
I kill with the lines and the letters with the verbs and the nouns
Just a kid trying get his sound heard around
Jump into cyphers and keep the old timers astounded
They said he was the best in the surroundance
Cause everyone around him was drownin'
In the fair one, no one son could pound him
With the lyrics, you pray you hear it
They say his bad hood couldn’t match his good spirit
And one day his mom and dad will be cheerin' to his grammy nomination
And proclamation to his world domination
Inauguration into greatness
From making rations to cakin'
2 AM and he be up like attic
He's an addict, alarm clock pop, he back at it
Barely got any sleep
But, he gotta eat
Cause ain't shit cheap and his soul/sole torned out of feet
He got dreams, but don't plan on sleeping until he reach 'em
Until you out feastin', paying houses where you sleep in
Until his album ready and his fans get it leaking just for sneak peaks and
Until then, his home is the booth
He spittin' to the plaque it's poof off his tooth
Like Hocus Pocus
Or word he's too focused
You should quote it
His goal is the denial that he wrote it
Flowin' like oceans and menstruals
Ink from the pen, lies within my credentials
They told me that I could be mental
But mommma always said that I was special
Haters tell me I should stop
My enemies tryin' see me in the box
So the streets tell me to cop a Glock and pop it
But something down deep tells me I'm the next prophet
Like the new Muhammad or the new Marcus Garvey
Or probably, it makes sense why I'm so heavily guarded
Wait, no, please restart it
I'm heavenly guarded, it's the golden child and for a while
God been looking down with a smile
Watchin' me prosper
Attackin' with the raps and then conquer

And just ride with a nigga like
Just fly with a nigga like
Just vibe with a nigga like
Uh, uh, one-two
Show you what this do, yo

It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
Clouds is they limits 'cause we in 'em
Eyes low, squinted, more L's but we winning
Acting like it's hard to find women when I'm in these hard-to-find linens
Remember those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ends, and it's only the beginning
Big pimpin', fooling dimes, rob 'em for they innocence
Cake like Entenmann's, flow sweet like cinnamon
He a child but they treat him like a bigger man
'Cause when the pen in his hand, they big 'em up like he Jigga man
Know you see him in the mirror fam
The ones who say you ain't hot be your biggest fan like, "Nigga, damn"
Before he got popular, he been the man
With your chick in the cam, rolling through an Instagram
Got a whiff of grands, now everybody say they distant fam
Know the haters still jelly, but fuck it though; it's the jam
It's the fuckin' jam

Yes, skrawberries

I'm a beast with these flows
Two birds, one stoned, you get geese’d when trees rolled
They say I'm evil cause I trained my ego to see gold
Cause he know, seagulls couldn't see these goals, please
It's the return of the Beast Coast
No cash flashed, but the cheese still make teeth show
Incognito, is how you move on the strip
What you tryna be Vito? Well there's rules to this shit
Don't get clapped, y'all ain't real spitters, y'all lips chapped
Better watch it, Mr. Nice Watch, don't risk that
I got a six-pack of bare skill that I spill like that
And everybody know (that shit crack!)
Y'all niggas softspoken, down below choking
The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men
It makes sense why you want beef, well this frozen
It's nuts for you screwed in the tool, and can't hold em
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go
The Progressive flows from New York to New Mexico
My lyrical span is what the fans is demandin'
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu stand in
Ain't no half steppin' around me
And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me
The young cop killer, I'm that ill, so doc' will ya
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer, nigga

That shit'll get your hips to move with no 7D's
Audi-opium, can I bust soliloquies?
Got that shit mixed and mastered, both remedies
Grab a spoonful, we stirrin' up a pot
And you know we gotta serve it while it's hot
I'm flowin' like a volcano and drippin' verses off the top
Dirty cops still swervin' on the block
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid
It's in my jeans so don't worry what my pants is
Get with the script, it's that ignorant shit
And they bound to get sick of us quick but I ain't sealin' my lips
It's a shift, I know you feel it man
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man
When it comes to kickin' verses, I'm Mr. Van Damme
Crushin' strawberries, it's a jam
So throw up both hands if you can
Ironic how I'm killin' this shit, until they bury me
My volume is going in depth with longevity

Sometimes I feel alienated
Because I'm not up in the stadium playing or on the radio sayin'
"Fuck 'em broads we don't love 'em we degradin' 'em!"
But always find my self back at the bacchanalian
Blood vessels poppin' out my craniums
Niggas askin' when the tape gon' drop but I got nothin' to say to them
Because I been slacking the skill, although my passion is real
I'm too caught up catching a feel when I should be cashin' a mil
It's something bout me being younger that affected my hunger
Got older in number, realized I can't count on these hundreds
To determine my elation
Pursuit of happiness I keep pacin', these motherfuckas racist
These ain't fair races, they just let the fear erase us
Adopted by the slums, son of guns this is how they raised us
Yo son we gotta raise up, don't let them just array us

Thinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake now
Cause I don't know who to believe or who to deceive
Got me thinkin' I sold my soul and ain't received a receipt
But I won't proceed to retreat, Jigga told me watch your throne seat
And now I sees it and in respect to B.I.G., I gotta cease it
And I hope he see me cause these niggas don't want beef with my talents
They ain't fit for this green, they just caesar salad
You think because you avid they just gonna let you have it?
It's a lot to learn and that my nigga need to ask us
It's the axis of the earth at the birth, I found a new balance
And now I walk on water like I knew balance
Just like a relative, marijuana sedatives

You've been warned on the risk it takes to sit on top
Been on clock cause you could see that I been on watch
Shit don't stop, 'til you make the sacrifices
Trade in what's priceless to ices and devices
When the light switch, I shift like I'm typin'
Livin' in the era where Christ is the crisis
The lifeless in the trance actin like yo mans
Bitch niggas only know that transactions is the plans
But the mic is in my hands so I valor the booth
The blacker the berry is, the more sour the fruit
They ejectin' us to make us cowards to the power of truth
Became flowers from roots and now we just move in cahoots

Let's get down tonight
I think I might blow a whole pound tonight
So shorty, hit me with the spot, and if it sound alright
Then you know I'm in the house
Let a nigga run his mouth, it's goin' down on sight
I'm always down to fight, ain't duff a nigga in a while
No bluff, ain't no church when you're livin' in the wild
I was hidden in the crowd, rippin' on some loud
'Til I seen the sucka nigga dick-lickin' on my style
Wow, must've been the material linen
Whole night, kept him in my peripheral vision
All I gotta say is the word and imperials get him
Word to my pops, I know niggas known for serial killin'
But back to the women, they tryna catch me slippin'
So I gotta pack a Mag' to stop venereal venoms from enterin' my system
If it ain't my moms or my 'sis then, I cut 'em in the system

They just wanna come and have fun
Told this little hun she could come, but don't touch my funds
I might get crazy, I might bust a gun
So just gimme some more, and I might bust a son, might bust and run
They said love will come knockin' at my door, well, I guess lust must've rung
The dutch touch the lungs and it was on
Had her beggin' for the dawn 'til the crack of dawn
Then I passed it off to Kwon
I said it gotta be the swank if it ain't the rank

Ma, you ain't that girl at giving throat so bye
F it, I'm bipolar, took shorty to the backroom
Play charades, she actin like a vacuum
Showed her to the door before the afternoon
She fell hard on the floor, so you know that she'll be back soon
Fake MC's get their reps ruined
Young villain hop up on the track then the track doomed
Click-clack-boom, resurrecting boom-bap from the tombs

Gassed up like Sunoco, press the pedal through the floor
Bitch we out the door, vroom vroom, skrrt
Bitch love don't live here no more

Now all I really do is get the grass lit and bust asses
I'm sure to blow like bust acid
Puff, assist like Maravich, a true Maverick
And I average above average on an average day
Doing bad shit bet you still can’t pass this
And his teacher still pass him
Though they adolescents be addin' rappin' sessions over addin' lessons
Like fuck trigonometry, I’m trying to multiply monopolies
Subtract some homies then divide the cheese
Divide legs just to isosceles so my eyes can see through the E
Shit on you hypotheses
Hypocrisy after essence like apostrophes
You can’t stand here unless you pay a posture fee
Part the cheese, head out the spot and leave
A pile of G's for apology

"Say, Brain—what do you wanna do tonight?

Who the fuck is this Joey Bada$$ nigga, son?

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow?
Point 'em out bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic?

Check!
Puffin' on stramonium, underground like potholes but going fossil
These bars like art in the Smithsonian
These flows is for custodians, homeless men, horny OBGYN dudes
Browsing my laptop lookin' at red fallopian tube
They like "Yo Joey, you rude", I'm like "If only you knew
I'm only in school for cosmology, that's why I act as lonely as you"
You see I'm wise beyond my years and my peers
So my voice over the snares is the only way they hear
What I got behind my membrane, but I've been smoking chem strains
So lately I've been having hard times with remembering
But be patient, my studies prove Egyptians ain't shit
Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in "The Matrix"
But fuck it, I'm erratic, momma lock me in the attic please
Til I draw enough static in my somatic anatomy
And come out imputed with fusions of "Blueprints" and "Illmatics"
I’ve been going raw, this just how I feel rappin'
We gave y'all Sur' Tactics, so y'all can’t even gas us
We taught you how to be prepared but still attacking the masses
Y'all better get y'all caskets cause we ‘bout to annihilate
(The new Babylon era) My empire gate’s in the Empire State
I’m on the higher platform, look at the way they clap for ‘em
Never fuck with phony men cause I don’t like my back torn

Yeah... another love song gone wrong
Should've known you were a.. woo! like Based God in Wonton
But I didn't, and I ain't even trippin'
Another foul ball, but I'm still glad I hit it
'Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know?
The coulda-shoulda type like, "Oh! It was slight too tight, come on!
I would've piped, but our schedules contradicted, we're always tied down"
Ay, pipe down! The first night, ya boy laid the pipe down
Took off the night gown and pulled out the slinky
She screamed, "Joey, spank me!", and after that she even thanked me
Swanky, one time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we be kickin' rhymes 'til the end of time
But.. back to the topic — oh yeah, I'm pissed off
And still tripped off and wonderin' why shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front — a nigga do miss her lip gloss
Now she sucks the next nigga dick off, and my dick's soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm 'posed to do?
And you know it ain't too easy gettin' over you
I sent them postcards so you know it's true
I promised that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it!
Why you front like you don't miss my whole cockpit down yo' esophagus?
Screamin', "Daddy, stop it!", rippin' out your tracks
Chipped nail polish in the scratches on my back
Like, did you forget about the time we had the sticky rolled?
And I tried to suck your titty hole for milk for my Cheerios?
Did you forget about the video when you first came?
I hit that spot twice and since then, you haven't been the same
But now I heard you fuckin' with some new man
Can't remember his name, but my first impression — "What a lame"
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walkin' out the bathroom kinda strange with his shoulder stained
Faggot, six months and I'm still at it
You'll probably never hear this track, but I still wrapped it
I guess I'm still attracted to you bein' here
I swear, I can't imagine you would not even care
Whole thing played out like magic, and it’s kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back, sometimes I get scared

Is leave the crib without some rubbers or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get a brother caught up in a sticky situation
Missing menstruation cycles
They all psycho ask Michael
Before you give her dough for billie jeans and them nice clothes
Like woah don't let them trap you on the tight rope
Spike holes in the condom to form a zygote
Overnight, ask Kwon, he know what it's like
He wore a hat but it exploded twice
But fuck a bad bitch I do this rap shit and put it over life
On the coldest nights son shine like a solar strike
And I swear I got the weirdest cases
Pipe chicks in the weirdest places from rooftops to staircases
Like get a load of their faces
Face it, if you fear, hate it, you get put into this clear space

Yeah, make sure my shit sound tight

I never knew the world could be this mad
Only vision I had of sex was Color Me Badd
And I, I never knew the world could be this cold
Only time a nigga die, he was playing a role
But now niggas get their souls stole' so often
They only thing they offer dreamers is a wake and a coffin
From NY, to Compton, down to Austin
She said that orphans morph into abortions without precaution
Problem with our people, there's too many wannabe Jordan
Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune scorin'
Too many wannabe actors instead of achieving their masters
At least a bachelors but no, too many wannabe rappers, hah
That's just statistics, don't mistake me for hypocrites
Like niggas in the White House supplying Wite-Out
On Jim Crow laws, you probably missed it
Hard to be persistent when you're tryin' to fight for your existence

It ain't easy livin' life like this

Mothers be jobless, so they make dollars shaking it topless, and

Shit like that make you wish you were adopted

Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit

Started blazing, and stargazing
See how you can reach your farthest aspirations
It's like holy matrimony in the matrix
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift
Cold feet 'cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a .47 with a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try and hide divine intentions
Like, let 'em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life hands you lemons it's time to eliminate
More sour than lemonade, anyways
Different days, different highs, different haze
Kamasutra with miss Mary Jane
And the karma suits her, she a vibrant thang

You niggas is suspect and I'm just a ruffneck
That wasn't breaking pencil tips when I would bust lead
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead
Her cunt wet, she getting rough sex, no sunset
I like a chick with a buck tooth, yeah it could get fucked too
We keep one eye open, they sus' too
Never tell 'em my government, make any covenant bitches be loving it
Say not to put a glove on it, some funny shit
You must've thought I was a dummy, miss
I feed lines to felines just to get up in their tummies quick
Yeah you got tricks but I got five more
So any game you try to play, you better know I got the high score
You better settle down cause you not on my level now
The Pros is semi-circle, they can tell the world you get around
Some niggas clowns, what's the shit about?
They used to doubt now they see us sprout and I'm out

When I was 13, I was bad, rapping 'bout guns we never had
Now we smoke raws with filter tips, old homies talking shit
Said you got what's best of mine but you stay plotting on that dime
Thought 'cause we was cool before that we gon' take yo ass on tour?
Fuck nah, this my chance to get it
How you entitled to my shine? Nigga you ain't help me get it
Now these niggas see me getting it, check the statements on my debit
My profile get requested but I never hit "accept"
Hit the sour to the chest, I reflect
When I was 14, up late, eyes glued to the sampler screen
Eyes beam, 'cause we can make it better
Smoking on that Jack Herer, welcome to the Progressive Era

And brains don't matter but tell me what really matters
When you pissed off at the world like you got a crazy bladder
And, momma always said that shit don't come on silver platters
So I gather my thoughts and make use of all these synonyms
'Cause I could never swallow the truth, like it's cinnamon
Excuse me if I'm militant
The sinning men in my hood could leave a nigga quivering
Like goddamn, deliver him, the venom and his liver is
Corrupting all his ligaments
Now he's at a standstill so tell me if he'll live again
The fire in his heart, still seem to be simmering
Now take that little simmer and turn it into adrenaline
Penicillin could not stop the drive he be giving 'em like mad fours
But fast forward, let's get to the part where his records
Could 'fford him a couple Fords like "Lord, ain't he gifted?"
Christmas just doesn't fit him, I need my own holiday
And by the way, I'ma possibly own Monopoly
And all McDonald's property 'cause I won't live in poverty like

Homie tripping, got 'em sounding like Hansen in the '90s
Charlie Manson your whole body, cause that damage in your party
Can you manage what I'm dishing out? Go get your wishing count
You sell me something then I flip that amount
I just switched that account, get that profit then I'm out
Yeah, they all wonder but it's Nyck bitch don't doubt
Rip your lips off your mouth
Man I'm violent ring the siren with these bars I'm reciting
Cars with no license
Hard man, I'm feeling like a spartan with a trident
Damn, picture perfect, bet I'll make that picture worth it
I'll be doubling my spot, no Louisiana Purchase
So declare that, with my hair back
You want a fair one, catch a fair smack

Slipping like fishes, choking when you hit the cypher
And I ain't talking weed smoke but I let the weed blow
Anything, just let the leaves know, oh
Suckas fuck around, get clapped where you rest at
Nigga saying you cracking, fabric of your imagination
Ask your lady
It's assassin when I come up on the track
It's a curse that I always try to find sex in these verses
But I got your attention, it's part of my ascension
But if I keep toking this strain

Who that mofo that came to showboat just 'cause he float like no other?
Style smooth as butter and slick like lubricant rubbers
So going in on tracks ain't a real test, the real quest
Is making real tracks with feelings people ain't feel yet
Dessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face, so lace me in the line-up
The bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge, rap is in my blood
So much, my capillaries adapted a sanctuary
From the fifth of January, every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times than my school's lunch line
So if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine
Been spitting dirty, the vocals recording spit shine

'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move 'cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you could see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul, probably you know
I found mines right through the pencil, started bodying flows
But fuck that, this be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to squeal
This one for my people, headed to the top, no redo
Thinking up evil but see no evil, just be Knievel
Cause I ain't ask to be this good, they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me clever
See God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error
The Era

Yo, what's the word word?
Pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Had to learn, had to learn (Had to learn)
We just had to burn (Check)

It all started with this special herb, then after that, it came to sexual words
I'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse
She played Bonnie and I collide with a vibe when I'm inside her walls
I cut my shorties on the side cause I decide that she all
Mine's, I keep her in my eyes at all times
Not because I don't trust her I just, can't get enough of her
On the phone late until her mom dukes be cussing her
She played the hustler and I'm like mad customers
Man swear I'm in love and ain't afraid to admit it
Be blowing up her line, man I swear I'm addicted
But, it's all cool cause when in love, we all fools
They say men lie and women lie naked, that's all foolin'
Numbers don't matter after the first night
Right, so what the fuck is love at its first sight
If you ask me, another stupid analogy
Made to cover flaws in the female anatomy

But I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front (Don't front) don't front (Don't front)
Don't front, don't front though (Don't, don't, don't front)
I got some weed and some fronto (Don't front)
And you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front (Don't front) don't front (Don't front)
Check (Don't, don't, don't front)
You might also like
It's like a massacre when mass occur
I got a massive urge but I had to learn
Heard you had it on lock so I pass the word
I stash the herb, sit back observe
That she make me feel good is all I ask of her
In the clouds, who would've known we would've crash and burn?
I prayed long and hard, hoping things will last with her
I ain't mad at her, but I really wish that it ain't have to hurt
Let's be blunt, we're best buds
Both knew our role this is more than just a crush
I used to pick her up longing for our lips to touch
But now I rarely even see her
In everybody, hood not even the law enforcement can keep up
She ain't want no one to know, so I kept it on the low
Any time that we would kick it, I make sure I had some toe
I thought I knew her better than anyone would know
Bagged her at her friends, but home were I would take her
Didn't know that she was a ho, that only wanted my paper
Whenever I was with her, my mind would just relax
Could've been the hot topic cause I swore we were a match and
I admit it girl you fine as hell
Don't know your perfume but you exert the finest smells
You tryna find her then follow her trail
She left a few old lovers inside of a jail, that's all a part of the tale
But I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front (Don't front) don't front (Don't front)
Don't front, don't front though (Don't, don't, don't front)
I got some weed and some fronto (Don't front)
And you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front (Don't front) don't front (Don't front)
Check (Don't, don't, don't front)

Ayo, don't tell me be patient with no doctor prescription
Emotionless positions and provocative visions
Should've known you missed a note like the octave was switching
Remember hate the game but she's spotting some glitches
It's a simulation yeah, stimulation
Take off your shirt, let me feel manipulative
My heart like the Himalayas, but yeah, I gotta slay her
I'm crushing on you sweetheart but yeah I'm a player
Sort of like Isaiah so baby let me coach you
And I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you
So, this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual
Nothing you ain't used to so my nothing is useable

We all try when you go bye, we all high
Truth is I'm never home and I'm cold if that's where the heart lies
So label me as heartless, it's not that I don't care
I just learned to use my heart less, gain sanity and lost stress
It put me in a state that just started taking a toll on me
Kept the secrets you told me, keep emotions I would hold beneath
Always kept the L so I know defeat
Said everything will feel much better soon as you know I leave
Not sure if it's the meds that made you think I'm mediocre
I was still body with a glove on, you know I'm cold, ma
I'm in animal pause, but you got an Ark
When it flooded, used to always feel like Noah
And I know I know her, had these kind of skills I had to show her
So I told her I'm the nigga she see on the posters
Came back through and I put it in the holster
Just had to teach her one time

Put it down, don't really give a fuck though (Don't front)
And tell your bitch don't front though (Don't front)
Don't front (Front, front, front, front)
(Don't, don't, don't, don't front)
Com sol e chuva…20Embed
Uh, uh, uh-uh
Yeah (Static Selektah)

Back on the set like I never left
I'm takin' steps to be the best 'til they lay me to rest
VVS upon my chest, it got them devious
Ain't no tints on my two-door, I want them see it's us
'Cause if I paid enough, them fuckers better see me comin'
I used to drive my mama bucket, ridin' 'round frontin'
On Snyder Avenue, buildin' number thirty-four-hunnid
I gave this shit my all or nothin', now my bank bussin'
I'm livin' plush', new crib cost a milli' plus
Six figures on every art piece that's hangin' up
You little niggas still spendin' on the obvious
And if you think I'm flexin' now, just wait 'til I re-up
And just to sum it up, we shinin' all year long
When I was comin' up, they tried to tell me that was wrong
I had to run it up, and now I'm right where I belong
If all my niggas dead and gone, I gotta carry on

I pray the Lord have mercy on a nigga soul
We reminiscin', reminiscin' like it's all we know
Take hollow tips and extra clips everywhere we go
'Cause I be takin' risk every time that I hit the door
I pray the Lord have mercy on a nigga soul

Focused on the present, know my presence is a gift
Just so happen to be good at rappin', that would be my niche
I was only like six when my cousin Richie Rich
Wrote my first verse for me that I would never forget
And since then I was never known to leave a microphone alone
Often took the long way home just to get thoughts off my dome
Mama blowin' up my phone, leave her message at the tone
I was gettin' in my zone, at times I felt so alone
Like how it feel to know that you the best and nobody know
Every punchline a chin check and a body blow
With all disrespect, you niggas still ain't fuckin' with me though
And never was
Every time they thought they had me down, I just leveled up

They all saw it
I'm from Brooklyn, I rep Brooklyn all day
They killed Biggie
Y'all niggas is killin' us and you fuckin'—
This world is about money, money revolve around money
Just know that I'm from Brooklyn

Everybody's dangerous, posin' with the stainless just to be famous
It's like you gotta be brainless, for real
'Cause believin' in things that ain't even real
They thought he was a gangsta, they thought he'd never tell
Time will tell, it reveals and it heals so I chill
Another day, another deal, made another mill'
But what do that mean when these kids still gettin' killed over no reason?
R.I.P. my cousin Rell', yo, I'm still grievin'
That's why I'm usually unavail
But what I need to call for help for? Bitch, I put myself on
Niggas behind bars vent to me on my cell phone
Hate it when they gotta leave the message at the dial tone
But they know I gotta do me if we gon' eat
So I proceed to unleash the beast, and decease the beast
Let me speak my peace, and if you reach, I teach
I'm only here because I'm known in the streets
I ain't proud about it but I wouldn't ride without it, ayy
Push me to my limit, bet you see I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Can these niggas fuck with me? I highly doubt it
I'm mildly psychotic, hide the body in the trunk
And still hit the hydraulics and prolly forget about it
The flow's a sick dot, it see through the trick knowledge
Never did college and I still raised dollars for tuition
You could buy my album for like eight dollars

Journalin' and jottin', we ain't know the world was watchin' (Facts)

Sometimes I gotta shed a real tear (Tear)
You see, the truth about Steelo, he lacked the mental health (He did)
But try to tell that to people way back in 2012 (I can't)
But now that it's a mainstream topic
I'm guessin' I can finally open up and talk about it
So, yeah, let's talk about it (Yeah)
Come into my mind, I show you where the darkest cloud is
You ready? I doubt it, but let's go
You see, Steelo was my bigger bro (Uh-huh)
At a point in time, spiritually, we was in the same boat, but
I wanted to take it slow
He wanted to take it as fast and deep as he could go, pause
Yeah, we had some problems, but what brothers don't? Sure
Then I caught a little wave and headed back to shore
And that's when he started drowning
And he had no one around him, so, partially, I feel it's my fault (Hey)
And that right there is my internal war (Uh-huh)
The reason why I got to feel these external flaws
The reason why I can't heal this eternal loss
The reason why I gotta feel this survivor's remorse (Shh)

Pastor Black Lip back on that shit
True story, look, so I'm in New York, my first time
One of my first times that I'm, I'm playin' my-my
One of my first albums for the big homie
And he got these kids in there, they just on skateboards
I'm like, "Yo, this super cool"
This, this guy got the kids out here, you know
Keepin' the kids off of the streets, right?
So, fast forward a year later, I go back to New York
And then I meet this kid, he's like, "Yeah, man
I don't know if you remember me, me and my homies, the Pro Era"
Crazy, I was like, "Oh, yeah, wha-what's your name?"
He said, "Capital STEEZ", I said, "Oh, okay, fosho"
Fast forward, my boy Doe called me, DoeBurger
That nigga called me and say, "Yo, you heard these kids
The Pro Era? Joey Bada$$?"
I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I met the kid Capital STEEZ, they crazy"
Fast forward another year or so, I'm on tour with Joey

Life is too short, we came a long way
From pissy hallways to court-side up in Barclays (Yeah)
Stuntin' is a sport, the way I'm ballin', we could all play (Ballin')
My cup overflowin', I'm feelin' fine in this Chardonnay
I dropped seven bands in Rick Owens, it was a calm day
Prices lookin' like a zip code, I switch zones when it get cold
So they gon' have to throw they shade from far away
I brought it in, walkin' with your broad down Broadway
Skip the foreplay and brought her back to where the Don lay
It's Brooklyn, get your chain tooken lookin' like entrées
Parted in my origin, get your troops, call 'em in
I gave 'em fair warnings
I'm up late nights and early mornings
I got a little buzz, I can't afford to miss my callin' now
Be the first to arrive and last to leave
Dropped out of school, still voted most likely to succeed (Ow)

My cat flow got you fat souls in fascination (Haha)
I made her make it clap, then I told her "Congratulations" (Yeah)

Curb your enthusiasm
It's the Creature from the Black Lagoon, snatch your Julie Adams
Most niggas really pooms when you wave the toolie at em' (Boom, boom)
Could've made the Goonies clap
But masked up like MF DOOM, don't know what truly had (Rest in peace)
And firstly, all my wolves is blood thirsty (Yeah)
Ready to shoot from mid-range like they James Worthy
Let a nigga try to hurt me (Try)
He gon' see some bloodhounds, some blue flags
Duck down or move fast and push your own kuf' back, nigga

Only magnum rounds when I bust and explode 'em
Eight figure nigga, so I'm always gettin' chosen
Middle of the summer, my ice is still frozen (Brr)
I try to show these niggas the ropes, they let it choke 'em
I got sick of playin' with niggas, I started coachin' (Yeah)
I ain't worried 'bout y'all hands, 'cause y'all jokers (Right)

You wouldn't know what really goin' on, you feel me?
We smokin', we drinkin'
It's good vibes, it's the right vibe
It's the player vibe
2000, we gettin' this shit right
You feel me? All night
Take that, take that, 'cause Diddy was just right here, you heard me?
My nigga Joey Bada$$, two-fuckin'-thousand
We saw it in '99, but now we in 2000

Something in the way you make me feel
Feel, feel (Statik Selektah)
Tell you, baby
Something in the way you make me feel
Feel, feel (Uh)

When opportunity meets preparation, I'm goin' off like a detonation
I want it all, fuck a reparation
I do it all with no hesitation
Fuck a punchline, I hit 'em with a combination like this shit was second nature
Layin' down the law like this shit is legislature
Alligator jaws sayin' ain't nobody greater
I bow my head and do my numbers like it's nothin' major
Over time, I've been too humble, time to up the wager
Eight figures later, got my life all figured out
Gotta have tunnel vision if you wanna make it out
No fear of missin' out
Ten thousand hours in, now it's time to make it count
Investin' ten percent of whatever in my bank account
Just in case we see bad weather, I hid a nice amount
You don't really lose on stocks, never, 'less you take 'em out
Thinkin' 'bout puttin' some equity in another house
Thin line between brevity and longevity
One thing I never sacrifice is integrity
I ain't nothin' like these rappers, it's a disparity
None of these niggas is seein' me, just for clarity
Rest in peace to STEEZ and Jun', they put the battery inside my back
Now I'm back to leave a casualty and flee the scene casually
I ain't even gotta aim, it's all hip accuracy
Amen in Jesus name, my niggas still gon' blast for me
Niggas got audacity thinkin' they could come after me
Runnin' this shit on these tracks just like an athlete
Automatic classic when Joey get on a Statik beat
All my bars appreciate with time like a Patek Philippe
Ooh, I been thrivin'
New Presi' on my wrist, call it Joe Biden
If I shoot, I never miss, I'ma keep firin'
The flow tyrant, I woke up and chose violence
Product of my environment walkin' in my alignment
I'm the reason why niggas talkin' 'bout retirement
I'm the reason why niggas often have been silent
Bow down to your highness, Brooklyn's finest
This flow make 'em think there's something wrong with they sinus
I came up from the underground and had to keep climbin'
I peep game like Jay, that's why he didn't sign us
Said keep the game at bay like the 49ers
47 shit, Steezy lookin' down smilin'
Stars keep alignin' so we gotta keep shinin'
I'm rare cut like a motherfuckin' pink diamond
The irony, I been the one you niggas underminin', nigga
This is somethin' to remind 'em
Hidden in the rough, where you find 'em
Shine so bright that it just might blind 'em

Just to sniff them roses, you might miss the violets
Overly contentment just for somethin' more excitin'
Just to never find it (Yeah) like fuck it, never mind it (Nah)
I wear my heart out on my sleeve, I just refuse to hide it
Vulnerability, peace and the tranquility (Uh-huh)
I give it all I got and to the best of my ability, yeah
I take it day by day with grace and that humility
'Cause I done lived in way too much hostility
Fuck if niggas feelin' me or not, these just-just my shoes
Thirty thousand feet above the block, this just-just my view
Bitch, I ain't got shit to lose, please don't make me lose my cool
I ain't got shit to prove to you, 'cause this ain't nothin' new
What more do they want from me? (What?) Demons, they been hauntin' me (Yeah)
Satan tryna offer me a deal that's gon' be hard for me to say no (Fuck)
Battlin' these evils, it's a struggle every day though

Had to cut the dead weight
Just so I could elevate and levitate, now let me set the record straight
Every day, I meditate 'cause I'm the one they love to hate
Focus on the bigger picture, tryna find a better way
'Cause I ain't finna cut myself short
Money gettin' longer, but happiness never been bought (Facts)
The type of shit I'll teach to my daughter never was taught
To me when I was younger 'cause that shit wasn't even a thought (Wasn't even a thought)

And everything I want just tryna meet me halfway
I try to stay calm, but niggas tryna blast me
The ski mask way, lookin' for a fast pay, so I stay
Armed and alarmed 'cause I ain't tryna go the fast way

To say what's on your mind, I promise to be fine
I could see the signs, be honest, I ain't blind

It's a big world, gotta try new things

So right here, right now, what you gotta say

'Cause transparency my love language
Can't see the bigger picture if your vision tangled
Love is like glass, either break it or you stain it
These late-night conversations turn into arraignments, just tell me the truth
'Cause I ain't tryna judge, baby, I just want you to be you
'Cause I'ma be me, keep it G like real niggas do
'Cause you knew a nigga way before he got famous on the block, nameless
And I'm proud to say the money never changed us
We've been through many phases like mazes, still we found a way
I never knew a love that wasn't painless
Pouring out my heart was always draining, I gotta say
Now every day, it's indigo rain, and yeah, this a brighter day
A lifetime I provide for you, by the way
Don't you forget that I would die for you any day

Right here, right now, what you gotta say?
You ain't gotta lie now, it's the bed we made, uh

You feel me? I said it, let's go
Come on
Turn my vocals up
Bring my vocals more to the front
Uh, yeah
This shit is like (Alhamdulillah)
Everything and more, you could actually sing this verse (Thank the Lord)
You gotta remember, no matter where you at, shit could always be worse
Toast for the better, little better

Men lie, women lie, numbers stay stuck
All my opps unified, I wish 'em all luck
Nobody's untouchable, still I never been touchеd (Never)
Ain't no chinks in my armor, not evеn a cuff
I scour the whole game in these Cartier buffs
How the fuck could I complain? My nigga, just look at us
Trips down memory lane, we took the bus (Right)
Now we getting escorts to the plane, we way up
Yesterday's price ain't tomorrow's gotta pay up (Yeah)
Say my stock like a teenage cock, it stays up (Haha)
Knowing that my time is borrowed so I stay prayed up (Uh)
My pockets got octaves I got my weight up (Weight)
Over time I learned to move smarter with this paper (Facts)
'Cause when I had my daughter, yo, that was the wake up (Facts)
529B for my lil' baby (Uh-huh)
Indigo Rain, already six figures in her name, shit crazy
What's the aftermath? God, niggas get shady (Uh-huh)
We gon' see who get the last laugh, they tryna play me
My lifestyle a movie, I'm feeling like Scorsese
Sexy like Swayze, just a bit more wavy (Uh, right)
Catch me in the 'Cedes, dirty dancing with your lady (Right)
She threw it like Brady, really, how could you blame me?
Niggas can't relate so they hate me (Uh-huh)
That's why I keep the Glock by the waist, it's no safety
Lately, gotta stay dangerous 'cause niggas taking aim at us
Paparazzi tryna spot me sloppy on the cameras (Uh-huh)
But I see the bigger pictures, I set the parameters (Right)
And anyone who beg to differ, I smoke 'em like cannabis
You amateurs can't handle us, trust me they ain't finna blow
They just really fans of us, they just think I didn't know
I see them hide behind the critics and the analysts
They get to talking scandalous when they ain't understanding us
But I'm a seasoned veteran (Right), always get the upper hand (Yeah)
Niggas going nowhere fast doing the running man
Joggin' in place with their feet up on the brakes
Tryna expand but stay the same size like rubber bands
In the meantime I rolls like the son of man
Shine like stunna man, looked out for all my pros
Forever my brother them, even if they all became cons
In the end, I would do it all again
No hesitation, they taught me patience
Brought me many revelations that I'd be taking
On this path that I'm blazin', this top position that I'm now embracin'
Could give a fuck about the praising, bitch I know I'm God
I'm half man, half amazing, I defy the odds
Leader of my generation, down to die for the cause
We all fighting the wars, hiding invisible scars (Right)

All I know is that my moms used to date you
I hate the motherfucking God that fucking made you
I take that back, sorry Lord but fuck him I'm thankful
Think about it, I could've been your little angel
Tuck me in at nights and help me with my times tables
And read me fables, I swear this shit is painful
I hope you in jail, niggas ripping up your anal
That's little Rachel, 5'4", eyes hazel
She the type to sell sex for them labels
She so confused, niggas zipping down her pants
She like "What to do?"
She won't refuse, 'cause she don't want them blacks and blues
On her eyes, for they have seen so many lies
So many times, and cried so many cries
She got dreams, wanna be seen on the movie screen
Live out in Hollywood, and act like it's probably good
And she probably could, she probably would
But she stuck in the hood
Mama's on crack, jobs ain't calling her back
She fading away into the black
Into the darkness, her baby brother half retarded
And the land-lord want them out of the apartment
By April, and it's like April
She don't deserve this, she's sweeter than maple
Since the cradle, she wanna leave
You see she can but she's just not able

Bitches on my cuticles, I changed the game like oodables?
The Davey Jones of rap is back, the bodies in my cubicle
Ever since a toddler, I had them call me father
Since ye' high, I got booty like prostate doctor
Mom want me be doctor, I be rhymin' like pasta
Eat them like they pasta, headed straight up, posture
Niggas can never knock the, hustling
Bitches on my balls, never fumbling
Nigga in fact they be doubling
But the hunnies get the smothering, never loving them
I never sleep, Got the heavy bags, struggling
They run from him when he approach, they call him the hero
All he need is thee cloak, cause murder what he wrote
And fuck guns, don't need those
Everything is done to the Max, no Keeble
Circle tighter than Speedo, I'm the Don like Cheadle
I'm flyer than eagle, I get the cheeks like pillows
Uh, I swear niggas they bout it, they bout shit
You'd be in good shape if ran like your mouth did
Ya'll lower than mouse shit, I'm higher than mountains
Keep false announcing, have you running like fountain
They ain't amounting to the money I'm counting
In a few year my accountants need accountants
Uh, everything y'all do is counters to me
Stupid nigga kinda seem you were counting on me
But I, bet you ain't trying to encounter with me
Nuh uh, I'm piranha, you some flounder to me
And the word on the grapevine, I'm going up great heights
Joey got enough line to capture a great white
I get more shine than late night, I'm beast who ain't ate right
Back up on my mojo, I'll show you what apes like
Nigga it's JoJo, They on my pogo, no homo
I ride the beat like the man on my polo
Ya'll some bozos, I'm underage, but pour more though

But I won't make it through the night

Cause suicide is painless, so I'm about to aim this
Weapon of steel right to my brain and just bang it
32 in the clip but one is in the chamber
Click clack, hope it freeze me from my anger
If you don't plan on staying, I'm saying
I'm better off just laying
Six feet deep underneath the fucking pavement
At least you work the grave-shift for treating me like ape shit
I even wrote you love songs but money's was your language

Chuckin' up the deuces to the suicidal vital motherfucking nuisance

Thought I was the better man
And we had a fucking plan just to make it all work out
Turned out, you not the one for me and it wasn't meant to be
But I still can't see, need to face reality
Cause your everything i wanted, a goddess
I said that on your behalf just trying to be modest
To be honest, but if I can't have you nobody can
Let me see you with another man and it's done for him
Call me fucking crazy but baby
How you gon' play me? I mean, have you seen me lately?
Went from elated to a swayze, ghostin'
Taking my life the only escape from your potion

I turned that fucking anal licking nigga into an angel
Fuck you mad at me for? Because I put the C4 in the car
And blew that motherfucker up, swerving off the Detour
Well hee haw, boo hoo; Now it's just we two
What you propose that we do?
(You hate me bitch?) Well me too
You turned me to a reject, dejected
But that presidental keeps me free stressing, I should be elected
I bet I'll win but I'm lost without you
Me minus her wonder what I'd amount to
Perhaps the suicidal bridal nigga I am currently
She ain't with my loving, she just only wanted currency

She left and broke my heart like twice

Vigorous, the illest realest lyricist
I'm sick like syphilis
Got a certificate for killing shit
And any innocent who witnesses the fucking incident
Got a team of militants
Punch lines, crunch ligaments
This is Mr. Bada$$, the young villain
Hide the children and hide the women
There's no slides when you're caught slippin' so be cautious
A homie keeps a gorgeous twelve gauge
So if you run your mouth, your jaw gone
The double entendre, monster
Niggas thank me, say I'm number one in the rankings
I tell 'em it's an honor
Cause these niggas faking and they nada
Fuckin' stupid Malagas, part of the Espana
I sip on Coladas and feel your chick tatas
'till I bust like pinatas
Only true Shotta, come kill 'em with the Patois
Same time, met the gal, and up for dagga, that's word to Spragga
I'm a young Wayne, I'm going insane, Liu Kang
Super Saiyan whenever the loops be playing
Only be a kid, but yo, see if the youth's playin'
When the doobs flamed, I get enlightened 'til I be in Zeus' lane
Find that quite amusing, I bone her like museum
Sit back, relax, and watch her bring it back, Boomerang
Now bring that back like poo stains in your new jeans
No need to be too ashamed
If you didn't get that the first time like new names
In my city, I be Bruce Wayne
Yup, cause when I get put on
I got them like new J's
He say, she say, who say that I'm not the next young Lupe
The one-handed shit you got to say, to you, touche
I'm the type to pull a dyke and only hit it on Tuesday
You the chump that when I come, it feel like it be Doomsday
Cause the flow is Apocalypse
You say them niggas ill
But they still ain't even shocking us
Yo, who the fuck is stopping us?
A bunch of nice niggas with aim like who blocking us?
BK where we stay, but you can still see the Pac in us
Oh, no disrespect to Diddy
Don't mean to be saditty

Life, she be bitching, so get it while you live it
And stop fronting, you need to quit it
I swear I'mma hit it, I just need you to pitch it
So hollar if you're with it
She tried to play me, She said that I'm only a baby
She said she gets crazy, it'll probably amaze me
She said that she too much, she don't think that I'm enough
I got a smooth style, but she like to do it rough
She caught me slippin', I wasn't trippin'
Cause it ain't a joke how I be ripping up the kitten
I told her listen, Lord knows that I'm a good Christian
But we can do it in the tub or we can do it in the kitchen
She started gigglin', She thinks I'm kiddin'
I was on a mission, blowing double o's, always get the women
I know she peep the fits, I told her read my lips
Said we can do it like that or like this
Cut the light switch
Close your eyes, let the music intervene
We can play some Marvin Gaye or a little Al Green
We can listen to some Prince while I kiss up on your lips

Yo, Nicki can't even rap

You could catch me on the Kawasaki, evadin' paparazzi
I was spotted with a hotty, gettin' blumpkin in a porter-potty
Feelin' like the man, but nose still snotty
And she knows I got hoes, but still want me to body (the kitty)
I'm not kiddin', nor am I lyin'
Should've known I'd be achieving 'til I'm dyin'
You know I'm not buyin' shit, keep supplyin' dick
Quit all that cryin' shit, and stop denyin' it
She like, "I usually don't do this"
I said, "Your foolish, I heard you did it to like half of the students"
I checked her quick, I threw her down, she intercepted it
And I ejected it, she swallowed and digested it. I jetted quick
No time for a marriage, baby in a carriage
I'm all about my cabbage, something like a rabbit
I'm trying to feed my ear a few carats but they ain't tryin' have it
They rather, see me die before they see me fly
With diamond supply fly and the jeans blue dye
That's over heads like rainbows
We ain't no hoes, you dodo birds, 4-0 verbs, you porno nerds
I got my own religion so fuck what your pastor sayin'
Hard shit up in your hands like you're masturbatin

"But look I got these iron sights, used to be in the army"

If your eyes ain't low like Ralph Lipschitz, you dipshits
Even the polices want me cause I rip shit
Puffing that piff shit, Blow out five O's like the Olympics
Evadin' on a RipStik yellin' "Eat my dust"
When cars for breakfast and lunch don't get ate 'til dusk
I spit it hotter than the days it don't get dusk 'til eight
And when you born in a maze, you learn to duck those strays
I know gang homies who wait around to buck those Tre's
But me, I chose to skate around, ya know, Bust those tre's
They get bucks, get paid, They get butt, get laid
Niggas who ball and shine hard, they get cut, catch fades
You see, I was one of those kids who stayed up passed late
So when it's time for school, I got up but still passed, great
Get passed- I forgot my line
I do it nonchalant, Spit it through the wire like I'm Chaka Khan

Ya'll can't be serious like films Ben Stiller in
Nobody iller than him at the top of his adrenaline
Flow sweet like cinnamon, Name a chick that I ain't swimming in
Uh, got flow for days, I'm sure to get paid if
They hate the price on son's life, it's sure to get raised
But there's no break when I got you pinned in
Said it uno, dos, tres then fin, I let him swim with like
Mad fishes, In the cut like mad stitches
I know you mad bitches mad how my style switches
So, frequently be freaking MC's with these frequencies
These freaking trees got me soaring over freaking seas
Too many freaking G's claim they make that deus pop
Please, the only thing you ever squeeze was your juicebox nigga
And you know it, cause real G's don't have to show it
Got your head in the clouds, big homie gotta get you focused
But know, it's all a part of the business, don't take it personal
It must be hurting you to know I could be merkin' you
At will, whenever I feel, this shit get realer
Foe squealers give the beats out to the nigga Dilla
I shine like crystals, Never held a pistol
Never packed a tool, but that don't mean that I won't fix you

Known to have chicks who go both ways and still down to blow J
Remember from rags to riches, being mad ambitious
Screaming "Fuck love" cause you was always mad at bitches

From the place they put potatoes on their nozzles just to silence hollows

With a dime chick in the tail flap, but her head is up

Call ? and Powers, hey, where's your iPhone 44 at?
Or did you end up like most cats who split a lot of cheese together?
The more cheddar, the more better, ya'll won't be friends forever
And I know it's probably killing you softly, pardon me
Thinking you can handle all of your problems costly
No matter what the cost be, you're quick to try and buy it off
Everything is win-win, you know you can't afford a loss
But blowing up was always the main dream
So I can't get mad if you're flowing in the mainstream
But you knew from now that it'll be this hard
Shit, you learned to trick broads when your dick got hard
And if you can do that, ain't shit should be stopping you
Anything is possible and any obstacle should be hoppable
And now you living where it's tropical, you got the most shade

They say all is fair in love and war and I ain't 'fraid to risk it all
Fuck it, if I trip and fall, barely do I miss your call
Safe to say you got me open, miss me, girl, I miss you morе
Soon as you walk through my door, I need your panties on the floor
I swear that you ain't got a flaw
It was lovе at the first time you let me hit it raw
If I shine, then we both shine, but let you shine more
Go above, beyond for her, my machete mi amore
Fuck who you was with before
'Cause you look better next to me, respectfully
Any nigga tryna get to you, he gotta check with me
Girl, that's just the principle, don't try to call that jealousy
I'm tryna start a legacy, add you to my pedigree

Now you already know why I'm here girl
Come here girl, let me lick up on your ear girl
You say you got a man, well I don't care girl
Cause I'm right here, he way over there girl
You ain't even got to do shit
Two minutes, and already spot your juices
And that's just how I do this
Sex game stupid, she thought that I was cupid
And don't you fight it, I know you know you like it
Cause when the light flick, I creep inside your private
Talk, Victoria's Secret
She see the polo draws, she start to debriefing
She say she want the treatment right
I kiss up on her neck and hold the cleavage tight
Till it's evening time, we been at it all day
If your ex's ain't do it as good, they all gay
You can hit me always, I be free and all day
Treat that cookie like a rookie, I just want more play
Who taught you ? I know it ain't Yeezy
Ain't trying to say you sleazy but this was too easy
He a mogul and I'm a local, but in the bed I really go loco
Let's take a photo, put it in slo-mo
And come get up on this poco

Just give it to me
I want ya, I need ya (I'm Sayin Girl)
Just give it to me
I want ya, I need ya (Aye C'mere Girl)
Just give it to me
I want ya, I need ya
Just give it to me

Round 2, say the word if you can't take it
And I understand you into breaking
But no can do
Hey I 4x2, now come blow my flute
You know you look so cute, when you down there
Little to the right, yea around there
Perfect, I'm glad we past flirting
Before you wasn't certain when I was lifting up your skirt and
But now you squirting, at the same time I'm bursting
You look good on twitter but even better in person
I wanna take the time out to say that it was worth it
Your trip from NYC to out here in Burston, I mean Boston
I'm a MAC like your lip gloss is
Girl you so fine I wonder what the cost is
A Dime ? I'd give that ass a Milli
Coochie got the power, neutrons on my jimmy
Know you thought I was a kiddy and know that I wouldn't last
You'd thought it be a quickie, you probably even laughed, well
I bet you regret that you said it
I can tell I'm the bestest by how wet your bed is
She told me "Shut Up" and just let it ride
I'm like girl that shit fat how much you let it slide?
She sighed and replied "It was only like 5"
I'm like "Fuck it, girl just close your eyes" and

Back when rappers was really rappers
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs

It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
Clouds'll stay limits cuz we in em'
Eyes low, squinting, more L's but we winning
Acting like it's hard to find women when I'm in these hard to find linens
Remeber those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ends and its only the beginning
Big pimpin', foolin' dimes rob em' for they innocence
Cake like Entenmann's, flow sweet like cinnamon
He a child but they treat him like the bigger man
Cuz when the pen in his hand they big him up like he Jigga Man
Know you see em' in the mirror fam
The ones who say you ain't hot be your biggest fan, like nigga damn
Before he got popular he been da' man
With yo' chick, in the can, rollin' thru an instant gram
Got a whiff a' grands now everybody say they distant fam
Know the haters still jelly but fuck it though, it's the jam... manYou might also
