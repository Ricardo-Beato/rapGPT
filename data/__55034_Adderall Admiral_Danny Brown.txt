55 ContributorsAdderall Admiral Lyrics
Eating on an Adderall, wash it down with alcohol
Writing holy mackerel, actual all factual
Out for the capital, matador your capsules
Hassle the bitch in a castle with ill grapples
Tackled her asshole, my dick like a lasso
Fucked her in the mouth and washed it down with Tabasco

Uh, you softer than Flanders' son
Don't make me put hands on son
Jump niggas like fuck one-on-one
Used to be locked up watching One on One
And young Kyla Pratt was looking thick, a nigga wanted some
But soon as I got out, white bitches by the ton

One more touch and then you'll see
World of hidden mystery
Visions of you know you're only dreaming

I fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw
While you niggas got blue balls like an Avatar
I'm eating caviar in El Salvador
She runnin' from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador
She a pregnant Labrador
Said the metaphors are the highest caliber
You might also like
Uh, I spit hard, you Hallmark card poets
So many lines, you can barcode it
She like to lick it on the head, then slow stroke it
Ocean in her panties and I'm 'bout to float through it
Rewind this and just smoke to it14Embed
