100 ContributorsShe Loves Me Lyrics
She loves me, she loves my knot
Not for who I am, but what I got, yeah
And I don't wanna blow up her spot
But da-na-na, na-na, da-naa (Woo)

Lady, I been watchin' you from the back every time that you walk past
Hate to put you on blast but you got a bomb ass (Yeah)
Been checkin' you out ever since the second you
Stepped in through Naunie's dressing room, girl, you're stunning, I'd bet that you'd
Zap me if I was next to you, sparks'll fly, I expect 'em to
I'd be shocked if they didn't, 'cause you're Carmen Electra-cute (Cutie)
And those ain't just sound effects
I knew something was special soon as we swapped info, I knew that

She loves me, she loves me not
For who I am, but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (Aha)
She loves me (One more time)
I said, 'cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me

Sorry I missed your call again, I be in the studio usually
But tomorrow afternoon for me'd work beautifully
If your schedule's open, you say, "That's cool with me
But you stood me up twice, Slim, you're 0-for-2 with me"
'Cause like a basket, you've been going through hoops for me
Well, if the ball's in my court, why don't we shoot for three?
Yeah, I'll pick you up and we'll cruise through the D
And as soon as we hung up, I'm like, "Woo"

'Cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (Aha)
She loves me (Ayo, lemme do this bridge right quick)

She pulls me close and whispers to me, oh-oh
Lies in my ear, but that's all I wanna hear
That's okay, long as we both know this is all it is, woah
She can have my love for as long as we both are here

We're back in my spot now (Yeah), the music is loud, so (What?)
I turn the boombox down (Shh), we cut off our cell phones
You're killin' me soft now, wanna hit it like Balboa
'Cause girl, you're a knockout, your body is out cold (Out cold)
(Woo) I put the moves on you like a U-Haul
Bend you over the foosball table, your shoes fall
To the floor, but canoodlin', I'm not in the mood for
Gotta get me out of these drawers if you wanna (want a) spoon, doll (Yeah)
But before we get to droppin' these drawers, there's options to explore
We can fuck in the closet (Yeah) or on my elevator (Uh)
And maybe when it stops and the door opens
We fall out and we just get off on this floor (Haha)
You say you're falling for me, but not 'cause I'm famous
Then explain to me who that tattoo that's on your leg's of
Girl, your game is an A-plus, but you think I don't notice
Who the screensaver on your damn phone is
It ain't 'cause who I am, bullshit, I like you
Just don't take me for no stupid ass, no disrespect
'Cause even though you're like my truest fan, know it's
Clear you only love me 'cause I'm Superman, Lois, but fuck it
'Cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me (Yeah, one more time)
I said, 'cause she loves me (She loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (She loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (Haha)
She loves me

She loves my knot, haha
I'm just playin', I ain't got no foosball table38Embed
