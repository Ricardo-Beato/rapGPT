Ooh

Imagine life, imagine life without me, it's a waste of time
You want the kind of love that can make a child
Don't want just anybody
(Not just anybody, not just anybody) Ooh
Good love fill my body up like a glass when you pour it all out
If you know me, you know I mind, someone like me is hard to find
No mistakin’ if I am there, well aware you are always mine
And still you seem so surprised, always gon' be mine

I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away, you drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it
And I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away, you drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, losе it

Imagine me circlin' through life without a piеce of you
Seven out of seven days I'm needin' you
You bring life to the party
(Ooh, ah-ha, ooh, ah-ha-ha)
Good love feels like butterflies suffocatin' your insides, oh
It's a late night, you know I try, I cannot picture when you lie
I'm mistaken thinkin' you were taken, knowin' that you were always mine
And still I feel so surprised, you're always gon' be mine

Rarely ever missin', talk is cheap and time is tickin'
Rarely ever trickin', catch me slippin', that pussy was leakin'
I'm on missions, payin' millions, I'm Ted DiBiase, uh, God
Out late night, I'm sinnin', still a Christian, don't tell my deacon
I mean pastor, or I'll go down there, talkin' faster
Ride around, six-seven bitches with no tint, you can see I'm pimpin'
Big four-five on my hip, like I'm limpin', never simpin'
One of my cousins crippin', always grippin', shit get dangerous
Always keep it player, we can swap out hoes, I'm never trippin'
I love my mother, my sister, my daughter
All these hoes get slaughtered, can't deny, pray to the holy father2Embed
