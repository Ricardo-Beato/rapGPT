I was in love wit' you, yeah-eh-eh (Uh-huh)
And you couldn't do no wrong in my eyes (Mhmm-mhmm-mhmm)
When I found out the scoop on you, yeah-eh-eh (Eheh)
It was still too hard for me to realize (Uh, yuh)
That I need to be through with you, yeah-eh-eh (Say what?)
'Cause you're the reason I can't eat nor sleep (Yeah, yeah, uh)
All the girls you're runnin' through, yeah-eh-eh (Uh-huh)
Used to be best friends, down with me-eh, yeah, oh, yeah

When I'm gone (Oh), you're alone (Oh)
You stickin' them chickens 'til I get home (Say what?)
When I'm home (Uh), you're with me (Yeah-eh, say what?)
Kissin' on my ass (Yeah-yeah), tryna be with me (Oh-ooh)
Well it's done (Well it's done), this I know (Uh-huh)
Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know (Uh, you don't know-oh)
You don't play games with me (Oh-oooh)
But before I go, better leave my dough
You might also like
I'm no fool for you, yeah-eh-eh (Say what?)
But you seem to think my love's a joke (It ain't a joke boo, uhh)
I get no love from you, yeah-eh-eh (Uh-huh)
Like all these times I did before (Uh, uh)
I think I'll pass on you, yeah, yeah-eh-eh (Uhh)
'Cause the way you been actin' lately (Say what?)
I get no cash from you, yeah-eh-eh
If you want me to stay, you must be cra-, crazy, oh, yeah (Uh-huh)

When I'm gone (When I'm gone, yeah-eh), you're alone (You're alone, yeah)
You stickin' them chickens 'til I get home (Say what? Get Home)
When I'm home (Uh), you're with me (Uh-huh with me-me, eh)
Kissin' on my ass, tryna be with me (Tryna be-eh)

Seen it for myself, I'ma let you know (Uh, you don't know-oh)
You don't play (No way) games with me (Oh, no-oh)
But before I go, better leave my dough

Dedication (Uh), dedication, yeah
It was just a bad relation (Yes, it was, yes, it was, uh-huh)
When I think it cuts my insides (Switch through, mhmm)
The tears, they fall deep down from my eyes (Uh, one, two, one-two, hit me)
Dedication (Uh, say what?), dedication
It was just a bad relation (Uh, It was just a fad, baby, baby)
When I think it cuts my insides (Uh-huh, oh-oh-oh, oooh, ooh)
The tears, they fall deep down from my eyes (Yuh, yuh, ooh-yeah, oh-oooh, oooh-oh)
Doo-doo-doo-ooh (Doo-ooh), doo-doo-doo-ooh (Doo-ooh)

Doo-doo-doo-ooh (Yuh, he-ey), doo-doo-doo-ooh (Yuh, *ah-ooooh*)
Da Brat, uh-uh, uh (*Ah-ooooh-ah*)

I want it all from the motherfuckin' house down to the dog (*barking*)
You trickin' off wit' these chickens, I thought you ain't have no flaws? (Uh-huh)
Keep yo' dick in they jaws, Peter shoulda stayed in his draws
Now I'm out the doors and you can't claim me no more, the loss is yours (Uhh)
How you gonna slumber wit' a bitch I'm supposed to be cool wit'? (Huh?)
Went to grade school wit', couldn't pay me to believe you hit it? (Shit, shit)
To think I footed all the bills and now you breakin' (Thank'y fa' all this shit)
Stop accusin' me of that dumb shit I don't even participate in (Uh)
You wastin' my valuable time, there's money to make
Scared to set foot in another relationship 'cause of the heartache
Heartbreak Hotel (Hahaha), no, not Faith, Kelly and Whitney
It's Brat, 'Liyah and Missy, you miss me, 'cause we finished (Uhh)
I'll just keep the keys to the 20 inch rim ride (Oh)
And put the TVs in it (Hahaha), you don't need it, be it, it's mine (That's my shit!)
You need to kiss my ass like your heart was in it (Any nex' min)
Keep stickin' them chickens, send Peter straight to the clinic, nigga (Uh-huh)
Hahaha (Ahaha), see, I'ma give you your props though (Uhh)
You like a bad ass motherfucker (Uhh)
Runnin' two bitches at one time
When I'm flyin' out, she flyin' in
Sayin' the same shit, spittin' the same game (Uhh)
Who the fuck you think I am? Willy Limpdick or somebody? (Uh-huh)
Forget you, man, heh
That's why us bitches gonna stick together, bitch
Uhh
Uhh, uh-uh-uh-uh1Embed
