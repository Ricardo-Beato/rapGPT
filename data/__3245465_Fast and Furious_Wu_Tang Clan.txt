29 ContributorsFast and Furious Lyrics
Pass the fuckin' weed, nigga
Man my fuckin' phone is goin' crazy right now, man
Once this nigga hit me up and bring me this blunt
Shit, man
Ahh this bitch
Ayo, ayo

It's like six in the morning
Me and Miller just finished our pack
Couple fiends on the avenue, they lookin' for crack
Grab the Nextel like yo L, police on the jack
I'm in that wide-body six and I'm sippin' on yak
Blunt of the apple haze got me chilling on lean, back high
Mean like, drive by pumpin' that lean back
Peace out, ridin' the whip
Look at how I'm ridin' my six
Four fifth tucked right on his hip
Some dumb drunk, this nigga has stick
Was parked right on the block
Watchin' us but I ain't peep him and shit
Anyway, back to the story, you steamin' and shit
Pass the piff, we got fiends waitin', fiendin' and shit
Connect got me waitin', fuck, so I'm heated and shit
On the phone cursin' at shorty, "I'm leavin' you, bitch"
Too much goin' on at one time, I'm dumb high
Seen a group of  tryna run by
This man in a whip, threw the clip and my gun dry
Please cock back, but he spin around one time
 his man comin' by
We're like two more trucks and they creep from behind
Threw it in drive, now Hue ride sick when he high
Pull up  they want us to die
Loose cannons do damage, well I'm dumpin' this 9
Whole clique in the back and we ready to ride
You might also like
I said I'm fast and I'm furious, headed on the I-95
Ready to ride when I'm blastin', I'm killin' shit
Fast and I'm furious, y'all want it with me?
Take a shot, here's a hundred and three
Shit I'm fast and I'm furious, headed on the I-95
Ready to ride when I'm blastin', I'm killin' shit
Fast and I'm furious, y'all want it with me?
Take a shot, here's a hundred and three

Hey, yo
Got the call from the connect from down bottom
They said they got the squares
And they all for a good price and they solid
Reply 10-4, hung up the horn, got dressed
Waves, rest the best, yes, threw the Franck Muller on
Sophisticated, nothin' flashy, solid king, move like a boss
But the calm flowin' into somethin' nasty
Puffin' on the finest cheeba, green as a rainforest
Doin' a buck on I-95, screamin', "I live for this,"
They just seen us comin', blew a flat
Pulled over to the shoulder
Pop the trunk to see if it's a spare in the back
A van pulled up, with Florida tags
Three men jumped out with guns drawn and they all wore masks
Snatched me up and handcuffed me
Hit me with the butt of the gun
I'm thinkin' to myself, "The war just begun"
Thirty minutes in the ride, the mask came off
The chickens dropped, the two in the back had Russian accents
Askin' who my connect is, where he rest shit
You better off squeezin' that tool bitch
He said, "Nah, you're worth more to us alive than dead."
He's flashed his badge and started laughin'
"Cocksucker, we the feds"
I said I'm fast and I'm furious, headed on the I-95
Ready to ride when I'm blastin', I'm killin' shit
Fast and I'm furious, y'all want it with me?
Take a shot, here's a hundred and three
Shit I'm fast and I'm furious, headed on the I-95
Ready to ride when I'm blastin', I'm killin' shit
Fast and I'm furious, y'all want it with me?
Take a shot, here's a hundred and threeEmbed
