20 ContributorsLola Bunny Lyrics
Loads of money 'cause I'm arrogant
Riding with Lola Bunny 'cause I got carrots
Riding with Lola Bunny 'cause I got carrots
In this room with tons of money, 'cause I'm arrogant
Somebody call Bud up, tell him we finna air it
Urm mm urr nn errr 'cause I'm servin'
And I smoke blunts in the air 'cause I'm arrogant
Urm mm urr nn errr 'cause I'm arrogant

Ice cream sprinkles in the, chain
No, you can't hang if you ain't, gang
Bitch, stop merging, stay up in yo', lane
Fuck you take the hit for if you ain't got no aim?
All these niggas rockin' with the, gang
Glock 40. that rock ya witcha, chain
The Jeep truck took off from the Mustang
The fuck you take the ride for if you weren't on a thang?
The fuck you in the whip for if you ain't squeezin'?
You ain't with the shits, then you should be leavin'
Free all my shortiеs out the damn prison
Loud pack bust my ear drums, I can't hear shit
Pussy got that fakе ice on, he embarrassed
I paid 3K for this scarf, I'm not a terrorist
Got out the cage and flew right past you like a parrot
Ridin' with Lola the Bunny 'cause I got carrots
Told that ho' don't talk to me because I'm married
She said her man got a chain, but he don't ever wear it
Baby, I can track the money, no matter where it is
You gon' see me pullin' up, wheels spinnin' like Ferris wheels
You gon' see me sildin' by shinier, that's some tyre shine
Accordin' to my watch, you can get up with me at anytime
Pull up super charge, like meet me down at the finish line
The shit they said when I was young, I'm older, man, I get it now
The bitch done went and got her face done, she think she pretty now
The bitch done went and got her ass done, she think she pokin' now
She got her buns out, it's hot out, she think she smokin' now
Took the bitch heart and ran away, I think she broken now
I got bread, I can't be loafin' now
Slid the car right to your slot, it's a token now
If I get caught, won't depend on no bitch don't hold me down
I'll shoot a nigga like "kuh", that's the Kobe sound
Young nigga you ridin' with a jock, they'll hold it down
'Fore you be onside of the law, you don't know us now
Then you got a nigga like me, who gon' know it's them
And I know they ran my fuckin' plates, like I know it's him
Bitch, get out my fuckin' face, if you don't know wassam
Gave a bitch a blunt and a bottle, now it's going down
All these bitches love fuckin' rappers, man, they going 'round
Just sent the brick, drywall, you know I tore it down
Bitch, get the fuck out the truck, if you don't know what's up
Strap on my M13, showin’ my shoulder love
Ain't no front-end, back-end, I don't go to clubs
Baby, let the cars back in, I'm tryna show the club
Hold on, niggas on some snake shit, mow the club
Gang gang, walked in, coolin’ tryna glow the club
Desert Eagle so big, this bitch'll blow the club
You think this shit a game, well phew, had to show the club
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew
Phew, phew, phew, phew, phew, phewYou might also like2Embed
