12 ContributorsVACATE Lyrics
K. Swisha

Ayy, say it ain't so
Brought two bitches, go fast and slow
Take my time, let they sis, but it really ain't, no
Turn on strip like a bank on gold
Paint on this like if they don't know
Ain't no mixing, slide on us
Ain't no issue with all that, huh
I'm just different and all that
I just dipped out with all that, uh
Take a picture, what I got on, ayy

Vacate the premises, uh
Y'all know what the premise is, yeah
I get prim and proper (Ooh!)
Like we at the opera (Ooh!)
I am not opposed to it if you tryna' pop up on me, hey, hey
Killin' me slowly
My chick look like Jenaveve Jolie, yeah
She got the remedy for me, when I get lonely
When we get around everybody ask, ooh
We pretend to be homies, uh
You might also like
But that ain't the case (yeah)
I put you back in the place (yeah)
Me and my brothers we back in the place (yeah)
Come and say hi
I understand if you wanna' stay high for this
I'm in this bitch with no oxygen
My bro tryna quit so he copped the pen
Them fellas you with, boy they not your friends
I heard what they said 'cause they said it to me
I had to tell you, couldn't let this shit be

Vacate the premises, uh
Y'all know what the premise is, yeah
I get prim and proper (Ooh!)
Like we at the opera (Ooh!)
I am not opposed to it if you tryna' pop up on me, hey, hey
Killin' me slowly
My chick look like Jenaveve Jolie, yeah
She got the remedy for me, when I get lonely
When we get around everybody ask, ooh
We pretend to be homies, uh

Uh, but that ain't the case
I know it's hard to relate, yeah
Made the mistake (yeah)
Told her that I had it for one of her friends
Listenin', look on her face
But it ain't up for debate
I just might treat it accordingly (hey, hey, woah)
Might be too late for the or-a-gy (hey, hey)
Runnin' the beat 'til the chorus hit
I'll just put fridge in the orange juice (ayy, haha)
Ayy, I don't look good in an orange suit
I need a 'rari or horse shoes
Hop in the car and wonton soup
I need a trip to Milan soon
I gotta make up my mind, uh
Tell me what she read online today
I do not work with a horoscope
I wonder what the thesaurus say
I'm on the wing just like Hornacek (woah)
Give me a minute
Had to get rid of my demons or sum'n
Like they was tenants (hey, hey)
I guess I feel like I'm Jesus or sum'n
Quick to forget it (yeah)
I heard that your shit was rented
Vacate the premises, uh
Y'all know what the premise is, yeah
I get prim and proper (Ooh!)
Like we at the opera (Ooh!)
I am not opposed to it if you tryna' pop up on me, hey, hey
Killin' me slowly
My chick look like Jenaveve Jolie, yeah
She got the remedy for me, when I get lonely
When we get around everybody ask, ooh
We pretend to be homies, uhEmbed
