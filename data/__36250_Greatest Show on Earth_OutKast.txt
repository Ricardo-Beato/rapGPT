12 ContributorsGreatest Show on Earth Lyrics
How y'all feelin tonight?
I don't give a damn...
Mama, I'm leavin way from home to join the circus
{*elephant sounds*}
And Papa, I'm goin to the place where them clowns get down.. get down
Sister, I know that there are lions, tigers, and bears
I'll be safe and sure to call y'all when I get there!

The, the, the, the greatest show on Eaaarrrttthhh

What you want, what you need
Wanna drank, wanna chief

Uncccllleee you should see all these dancing girls
And every night I get to sleep under the big top

The, the, the, the greatest show on Eaaarrrttthhh
