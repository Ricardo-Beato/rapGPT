All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

Yo, boo, let's cut the crap, you know we like each other
I been wanting you bad, yo, that's word to my mother
I know you got a man, and I'm involved
But we can play this right, if we shuffle the cards
I've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke
I run and help you with your bags upstairs
I was scoping you out, today you was late, to leave by 8
With no time to be at work at 9
She'll be back by 6, son pissed you off, I know
When I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit
But still, you was looking mad cute to me
With your lips poked out, being rude to me
You're still sexy, luscious, and all them words
Only girl in the building with a full length fur
Had no choice to raise and press up, explain how I feel
It's only your love I want the best of
You might also like
All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

I had a dream, yo, I seen you on the laundry mat
Folding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet
So you passed me a Bounce, one fell when I bend down
And got up, you start tonguing me down
Butterflies ran across my stomach
Didn't wanna put the fire out, cuz God damn, I love it
Moved the basket out the way, cleared the table
Laid you down, my mouth slid past your navel
Your feet, had knocked over the Clorox bleach
Held my head closer to you when my tongue got deep
I'm saying we both of those, this how I feel
If you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal
But ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes
Somewhere inside, I know you feel the same
It's alright though, you look like, you know how to get it
Here take my keys, come upstairs in a minute
All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know

Let's stop faking, let's just go get naked
No more discussion, we can get to kiss and hugging
My premonition, told me I got what you're missing
So let's stop playing, baby girl, that's all I'm saying

All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
All I'm saying, come here, lady
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you know
I got no patience, I hate waiting
I can't take it, let's stop playing
Oh, you know, you knowEmbed
