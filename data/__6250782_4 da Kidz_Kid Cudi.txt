61 Contributors4 da Kidz Lyrics
Mm-mm, hm, yeah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-ah, nah-nah-nah, nah-nah
Yeah (Yeah, oh)
This song is dedicated to you (Ooh)
We got you (Ooh)
Yeah (Mmm)

Do it all day for the kiddies (Yeah)
Real-life dreamers in the suburbs and the cities (Come on)
Ridin' 'round town, windows up, steamin', beamin' (Yeah)
Singin' along to it in the cut, heavy streamin' (Yeah)
Mama don't know what a lil' nigga feelin' (Nuh-huh)
Daddy been gone and my brothers stay trippin' (Uh)
For every lil' homie that's lonely
This is all for you, give a fuck about the phony (Yeah)
All in the plan, as you grow, make the moments last (Huh)
Even though in life, it seems the shit moves fast
Codе to the realest, hands high, feel this (Yеah)
Smoke one to the head, but remember, shit's vicious (Come on)
Never lose hope, if you don't, you'll be golden (Yeah)
Always keep your family close, keep your heart open
Here's to the chosen, solo dolo rollin', hm

This is just the right vibe, turn it loud if you need to (To)
Stars in the sky, they will light your way through (Through)
Feelin' alone, just know you are not
We won't leave you alone, oh-oh
This is just the right vibe, turn it loud if you need to (To)
Stars in the sky, they will light your way through (Through)
Feelin' alone, just know you are not
We won't leave you alone, oh-oh
You might also like
Since day one, I been tryna feel alive (Baby)
Doin' what I wanna, go fast and hold tight
Seein' what I'm seein', the pain, I will write (Yeah)
Ooh, we're children in the night (Come on)
Nigga with a vision, hope it come into fruition
Yeah, I know it well, dreamin', intermission now
Things are gettin' better, waited my whole life, oh, my, my, my, my (Yeah)
As we glidin' through the streets
This is just the moment where you truly feel free
Got my blunt up to the heavens (Ah), tell 'em not to worry, no (Ah)
Guided by the moon, how I do what I do (Yeah)
Everything's copacetic, push the limit (Uh-huh)
Been in this hell so long
I know soon, peace will find you (Yeah)

This is just the right vibe
Stars in the sky
Feelin' alone, just know you are not
We won't leave you alone (Oh-oh)

This is just the right vibe, turn it loud if you need to
Stars in the sky, they will light your way through
Feelin' alone, just know you are not
We won't leave you alone, oh-oh
(Mm, mm, mm)
(Mm, mm, mm)
(Yes, look what I have created)
(I have made fire)12Embed
