14 ContributorsNAMELESS Lyrics
I think it's wrong but then it's called, "Survival"
You have to eat
You have to pay bills
You have to survive
So when get you used to pullin' a trigger on somebody
I-It's not hard to pick up a gun and just shoot
You know?
It's not hard after a while
It becomes easy, calmin'
And dependin' on the people that you shootin' at
And the reason for you doin' it, it might be fun
You-you shot someone?
That's what they said, several times, that's what they said
Were they right?
I don't know, bullets don't have namesYou might also like2Embed
