2 ContributorsSame Ol’ Same Lyrics
It's like the world stopped spinning
Niggas in the game not winning
Not much of a prize to keep your eyes
There's money to be made so we grind on
Gunshots up the block heard
A young cat must've got served
A hard head made a soft ass
You talk that shit, you better walk fast
Street life to the death of me
The game's so cold it need a referee
Nowadays you could talk to 'em
Back then, they put chalk to 'em
"I'm sorry, Mister Officer, but
I can't understand what you saying, you talking that fuck"
I'ma leave with the same rules I came with
And only real cats can say the same shit

If we going backwards, you know what'll happen
But it doesn't matter
Different day but everything's the same, ooh

I don't give a fuck where you from, dawg
Take your ass home, nigga, fuck y'all
You got guns, we got guns too
But we be quick to show you what them guns do
If you ain't from here, don't come here
You already know how it's done here
No new friends, no old moves
Game I was fed by the old dudes
So I abide by them old rules
Don't talk about no money, I don't owe you
I don't know you; you ain't day one
You imaginary hustler; you fake, son
You break one, and catch dude
You bag me, they wet you
It's simple, ain't no need to complicate that
I separate the real from the fake cats
My nigga, face facts, I bust bang
I'm from the H so it's a must I let my nuts hang
I leave with them same rules I came with
And all the real dudes say the same shit
You might also like
If we going backwards, you know what'll happen
But it doesn't matter
Different day but everything's the same, ooh

To hell with all that friendship shit
Your friend'll make you kill that bitch
You know we started at the same spot
We was getting money then it came out
Was tryna put me in a cross though
Five came back but he lost four
He said "I did it like that
That was a—Brad, let me hit you right back"
Got niggas plotting on me like I'm fucked up
Talking reckless ain't gon' draw my nuts, Chuck
What's up? You niggas got me all wrong
I've been a solid dude all along
So hard looks don't scare me
If you wanna start a war, come near me
Itchy trigger finger since my childhood
In any situation, I'm good
I'm hood, I fear nothing
Just God, now here's something
That you can go to the grave with
I come in here and leave with the same shit
If we going backwards, you know what'll happen
But it doesn't matter
Different day but everything's the same, oohEmbed
