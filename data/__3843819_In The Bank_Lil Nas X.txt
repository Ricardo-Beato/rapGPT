19 ContributorsIn The Bank Lyrics
Uh
Uh, uh
Uh
Uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Guess I'm finna pop shit
Niggas run and they hide when I drop shit
Balenciagas on my paw print
Twelve ask a nigga questions, I ain't saw shit
Wait, I mean I didn't see shit
I line 'em up and then I shoot, I Bloc B shit
They gon' miss me when I leave shit
'Cause all these other rap niggas won't be shit
Uh, I gotta check the stash
New whip, oh my God, you gotta check the dash
Real-ass nigga, so I don't fuck with trash
Niggas mad 'cause I'm makin' cash fast like Dash, yo
My big bro is telling me
"You finna blow, lil' bro, be a celebrity"
And I don't even need no melody
I'm killin' rappers, all you niggas is in jeopardy
You might also like
Lil' boy, I am killing ya
Keep a stack in the bank, no Azealia
Last night, I just made about a milli', uh
On my soul, man, you niggas not real enough
Uh, lil' boy, I am killing ya
Keep a stack in the bank, no Azealia
Last night, I just made about a milli', uh
On my soul, man, you niggas not real enough

Ugh, you niggas not real e-
Pour up the cup with some lean, yes, I fill up
Flow is on go, and you know that my bro
Chop off your pinkie toe, so lay low, he a killer
Yeah, platinum Pateks, Yappas automatic
Lil Nas X up next
So you upset, say, "He problematic"
Niggas so dramatic, uh
Yo, I'm James, yes, I'm Harden
I go gorilla when guardin'
Shit on you niggas, I'm fartin'
Minks and chinchillas, I'm startin'
I'm disregardin' all your barkin'
At a party and I'm sparkin'
So fuck the sneak-dissing, please listen
You beef with yourself, while my 'Rari is parkin'
Bitch
Lil' boy, I am killing ya
Keep a stack in the bank, no Azealia
Last night, I just made about a milli', uh
On my soul, man, you niggas not real enough
Uh, lil' boy, I am killing ya
Keep a stack in the bank, no Azealia
Last night, I just made about a milli', uh
On my soul, man, you niggas not real enough

On-on my soul, man, you niggas not real enough
On-on my soul, man, you niggas not real enough-ough
Like, like, like Azealia
Like, like, like Azealia
Like, like, like Azealia

Lil' boy, I am killing ya
Keep a stack in the bank, no Azealia
Last night, I just made about a milli', uh
On my soul, man, you niggas not real enough
Uh, lil' boy, I am killing ya
Keep a stack in the bank, no Azealia
Last night, I just made about a milli', uh
On my soul, man, you niggas not real enoughEmbed
