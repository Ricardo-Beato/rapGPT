Soon I will be done
With the trouble of the world
I'm going home (Going home with Jesus)
I'm going home (Going home with the Lord)
Soon I will be done
With the trouble of this world
I'm going home (Going home with Jesus)
I'm going home (Going home with the Lord)
Soon I will be done
With all this sickness and pain
I'm going home (Going home with Jesus)
I'm going home (Going home with the Lord)
Soon I will be able
To see my Jesus face
I'm going home (Going home with Jesus)
I'm going home (Going home with the Lord)

I'm going home (Going home with Jesus)
I'm going home (Going home with the Lord)
I on't know about you
I'm going home (Going home to Jesus)
Yeah, I'm going home (Going home with the Lord)
I'm going home (Going home to Jesus)
One of old days (Going home with Jesus)
Won't ever cry (Going home with Jesus)
I'm going home (Going home to Jesus)
(Yeah) Going home, (Going home), Going home
This world (I'm going home)
Is not my home (I'm going home)
One of these days (I'm going home)
The doctor will (I'm going home)
Clean my tongue (I'm going home)
To the roof of my mouth (I'm going home)
Tape my eyes (I'm going home)
My eyelids, yeah (I'm going home)
That's when (I'm going home)
I make my transition (I'm going home)
Going home (I'm going home)
To see Jesus (I'm going home)
I'm going home (I'm going home)
To see Jesus (I'm going home)
Oh, I'm going (I'm going home with Jesus)
Will you beat me (I'm going home with Jesus)
Will you meet me there (I'm going home with Jesus)
I'm living on edge (I'm going home with Jesus)

Soon I will be done
With the troubles of the world
I'm going home (Going home with Jesus)
I'm going home (Going home)
With the Lord (With the Lord)
Good evening, good eveningEmbed
