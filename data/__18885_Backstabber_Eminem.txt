90 ContributorsBackstabber Lyrics
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back, fellas
He could be coming after your girlfriend next

There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all, be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys
You might also like
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend, or I'm gonna kill ya!"

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done!
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!17Embed
