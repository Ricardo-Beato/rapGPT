5 ContributorsLost My Plug Lyrics
Did it for real
Did it for real
Did it for real
I used to jug, I lost the jug
Bills andKelos, bills and Kelos
Bills and Kelos, I used to jug, I lost the jug
I lost my plug, I lost my plug
I lost my plug, I used to jug
I lost the jug

Georgio, Georgio, Georgio, I lost my plug
I crossed off a deal, made me a deal, his price was low
Got bricks that torpito across the boarder, start placing your order
Got them fishes, they drop in the water
Chef in the kitchen, I'm cooking your order
Do it for real, I knock off your bro
Play off my Cho, I knock you with the 4
The egg with the beaters, I whip up the Coke
100 percent, see no shit like before
I'm back like the 80's, riding with my baby
Want 20, I surve you a baby
I switch up and get the work from your old lady
She told me I'm rich, I think that she shady
Them cookies I'm baking, they tasting amazing
We fuck with them Mexicans, and them Jamaicans
They say that I'm missing, my paper be short
I smashed up your sign, show me the vault
Told you before, I want it for my dogs
Guwop told me "don't fuck with him, dog"
I thought I had real trust for you, dog
Rich in the ring, throw it in the Benz now
Longway!

Did it for real
Did it for real
Did it for real
I used to jug, I lost the jug
Bills andKelos, bills and Kelos
Bills and Kelos, I used to jug, I lost the jug
I lost my plug, I lost my plug
I lost my plug, I used to jug
I lost the jug

I fuck with the plug, no tourest
He got rich, and he don't got insurance
Take it, it boost my endurance
Smoking on gas like my name is Curren$y
Whitness the plug give me the work that's currant
Hop in the Rover, put up them curtens
Trap like a boss, cause I gotta stay workin
All them ghosts and them goblins, they lurkin
Fuck with my soldiers, they robbin and taken
Hustling and booming, I sold them Masons
Coke so strong, like I'm President Raiggen
Trapped out Southcentral Station
I'm switching up lawyers, I'm beating them cases
Juggin with George, and juggin with hasians
Back to the basics, I'm thumbing through faces
Used to be a jugger, now I take it
My diamonds they poke, my neck look like a glaciar
Engen in the rear, fuck it, we racing
Then for real, we rap it and take it
Damb, damb, I lost my plug
Damb for real, I cross you and take you
Surv you a brick, and surv it right up
I used to be juggin, I lost my plug
Longway!
Did it for real
Did it for real
Did it for real
I used to jug, I lost the jug
Bills andKelos, bills and Kelos
Bills and Kelos, I used to jug, I lost the jug
I lost my plug, I lost my plug
I lost my plug, I used to jug
I lost the jugEmbed
