22 ContributorsYou Are Not Alone Lyrics
Uh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh, uh, uh

You are not alone (Not alone)
Matter of fact, I'm in the other room (Other room)
I'm just watching you niggas with the scope (Yeah)
Got the drop on you niggas
At any given time, it could go down
You are not alone (Not alone)
Have niggas in your crib, when you not at home
I am not alone (Nah), I got hitters that you've never seen
You bitches better watch your tone
'Cause any given time, it could go down, down
If we talking drip, I got that shit that make you drown, drown
Everybody know that I'm the trendsetter, yeah, yeah
Past, present, future, no one do it better, no, nah, no, nah
You are not alone, no, no, no
Niggas leave them broke boys alone (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
Your nigga blowing up my phone (What what, what what, what)
He kinda cute too, you better get him
'Cause at any given time, it could down
We are not alone (Not alone)
His girl is in the other room (Other room)
But he's here with me and it's plain to see we got chemistry
But any given time, it could go down
All these black bottles of Patron
But the Henny got me feeling like Jill Scott on the microphone
Haters, please leave my life alone 'fore your life be gone
Any given time, it could go down, down
You are not alone, I'm always there like your shadow
Haters throwing shots, but ain't got enough ammo
I get low in these streets like a army fatigue Lambo
I camouflage well in this Valentino camo
I dismantle any competition to the coalition
What Big started, I'm 'bout to finish
You witness greatness every time I spit this
Like a judge, an overdue sentence
Haters, please leave my life alone
You should never compare diamonds to a rhinestone
I'm like Khaleesi on the Game of Thrones
Get under your skin and burn your flesh and bones
Haters, please leave my life alone
Please leave my life alone
Please leave my life alone
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though you always hate, all you do is make me great
Leave my life alone
Haters, please leave my life alone
Please leave my life aloneYou might also like7Embed
