Hollywood Cole, go
Ayy, Hollywood, ayy, Hollywood Cole, go
My nigga done went Hollywood

You wanna know just where I'm at?
Well, let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map
But let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back
Ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
Man, fuck them niggas, I come back
Ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it:
Heads up, e'rybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like, "Man, that's what e'rybody said" (Uh-huh)
Go and pop the trunk and now e'rybody dead
E'rybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better (Better)
All my bitches the pick of the litter (Yeah,) never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me, I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake (Cake), uh
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great (Great)
Order Domino then she take off all her cloth'
Nigga you know how it go, make the pizza man wait (Hol' up! Hol' up! Hol' up!)
The best-kept secret
Even Hov tried to keep it then I leaked the damn tape, uh
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe
You might also like
I said, to the window, to the wall (To the wall)
My nigga ride when I call (I call)
Got bitches all on my mind (My mind)
Fuck nigga blockin' my shine (My shine)
I know the reason you feel a lil way
I know just who you wan' be
So every day I thank the Man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

Get off my dick
Woah (Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick
Woah (Get the fuck off my dick, nigga)
Get off my dick (Bitch)
Woah (Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick
Woah

Man, fuck them niggas, I come home
And I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough
And I don't tell nobody
Lord, will you tell me if I changed?
I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine
And I won't tell nobody
This is the part that the thugs skip!

Young nigga never had love, you know
Foot massage, back rub shit
Blowin' bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watched years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' 'bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through, the break-up
Get to know somebody and you really learn
A lot about 'em, won’t be long 'fore you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you're better off without 'em
Then in time, you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie, it's just 1 Thing about 'em, it's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(No more), no more
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga, don't sing about this shit, nigga)
But e'ry nigga in the club singin'
To the window, to the wall (To the wall)
My nigga ride when I call (I call)
Got bitches all on my mind (My mind)
Fuck nigga blockin' my shine (My shine)
I know the reason you feel a lil way
I know just who you wan' be
So every day I thank the Man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

Get off my dick
But e'ry nigga in the club singin'
Singin' this song, yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singin'
Singin' this song, yeah
And all the mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song, yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
This song, yeah, song, yeah
Song, yeah, song-song, yeah

The make up
This shit is retarded
Goddamn
Why every rich Black nigga gotta be famous?
Why every broke Black nigga gotta be brainless?
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights, here's a scenario:
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year, we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga, I'm very sure
Heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home, I'm the best in the South
When I'm in L.A., I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'ma stretch niggas out
Ooh, I'ma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for e'rybody on my testicle
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho
