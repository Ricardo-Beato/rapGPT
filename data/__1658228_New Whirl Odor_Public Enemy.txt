"...Public Enemy"
"We will make it funky!"
"Public Enemy"

I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor

Check that soul in 'cause the tape is rollin
The Black don't crack, where that party at?
Stax, jump back, come on, wax them tracks
Johnny Juice, cut it live like them old 45's
Strong songs survive on them biggest records
Ninety-five beats per second, P.E. record
Now the color of death looks like the future is history
Now why you dissin' me? Cause it ain't no mystery
On the outside peekin' in, end of your freeride
No way we can win, 'cause this the beginning of the end
Of your liberal friends who sometimes pretend
Everything's changed, while nothing's changed much
Uh, don't y'all know, this is Chuck D
Stays to the left of this and to the right of that
Just Black, don't y'all know where my mind be at
Shit, I wanna know where's the rest of my cats
High trees be catchin' a lot of wind, my friend
I smell a New Whirl Odor
You might also like
"Here we go again"
"Public Enemy, New Whirl Odor"

I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor

I flock to refugees who flock to me
The Roots, The Coup, and kick aside the genocide and the juice
Comedians, actors, nuclear reactors, players and ballplayers
Singers, dancers, and rhymesayers
Why do us like you do, ska-doo, fuck the residue
Frustrated five on two's, no breaks for mad crews
Now who the fuck is you? Cause we sick-a you
Now who the fuck is you? Cause we sick-a you
Community hoe-ses who be posin' as Moses in street clothes
Who be the closest in blows-es
Now every rhyme be for the future of mankind
Crazy heads be cuttin' off they dreads
Ruinin' health with little knowledge of self
Income taxes breakin' off the backs off-a Blacks
Who done four hundred years in this abyss?
So I'm pissed the fuck at this New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor
I smell a New Whirl Odor, I smell a New Whirl Odor

Some things in the air when the smoke clears
Will it only be White folks and nothin' but Black jokes?
How many be gone if they bomb barbershops and hair salons?
It's time to dot com, time to dot com
Before they rub out clubs where you get your drink on
Mother, father, sister, bro, love is the message
But war be the frontpage in this mess-age
Ghetto celebs spread by the hundreds, macked by the same tactics
With us in a tundra goin' under
Avoidin' cries from sodomized society
It's scary getting screwed without a dictionary
It's scary getting screwed without a dictionary
It's scary getting screwed without a dictionary

The world is a ball of confusion
The world is a ball of confusion
The world is a ball of confusion
The world is a ball of confusionEmbed
