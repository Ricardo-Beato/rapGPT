The Apphiliates nigga, pay attention
CTE!
Im on the block buster where the drama at
I got a gangsta boo she show me where them dollars at
Aaaaaaaaaay
I cook the yams, she does the dishes
She leave with it and come back then we count the riches
Jeezy the bankteller i seen them figures
Thats why I run circles round you sqaure ass niggas
Here we go again, another lecture boy
And I'll never .38 ya, I'll tech ya boy
Like ya fell in a pool, straight wet ya boy
You wanna try ya heart won't let ya boy
You got beef, we got shells, we'll hamburger help ya
Leave you layin in the streets so ya homies can help ya
Haaaaahaaaaa
Then we right back to the money
Jacksons and them Grants, we right back to the money
Money talk, bullshit walk a thousand miles
Anywhere anytime nigga a thousand roundsYou might also likeEmbed
