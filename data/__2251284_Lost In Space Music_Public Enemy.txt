1 ContributorLost In Space Music Lyrics
Lost in space... music
Yeah!

Every generation
Got their music
Kick it!
Beyond this hatin’
Every generation
Gots its favorite (Haha)
Favorite nation (Hahaha)
New releases
Label ceases
To release it
Magazine pieces
Lambo leases
Gabardine creases
What we gonna do?
Fashionistas
Lovin’ that music

Lost in music
Don't understand it!
Lost in music
I’m lost in music
You might also likeYa know... some of these dudes out here ain’t right

Lovin’ believin’ it
Without even seein’ it
Young folk feel it
Not even bein’ it
People say steal it
I’m a realist
Damn
Pass the cam
(Daaaaaam!)
Turnt up brand

Lost-Lost-Lost in music
Don’t understand it!
Lost in music
Yeah!
