Yeah, this Lil Uzi Vert
(T-T-T-T-Turbo)
I'm ready
(T-T-T-T-Turbo on the track)
Let's go

I don't ever want to talk about it
I don't ever want to see you (No)
Everybody, they been changing now
Now you see what the cheese do (Yeah)
I understand, charge it to the game
Everybody wanna feast too (Yes)
I put gold all up on my neck
I put gold on my teeth too (Woah)
I ain't never stayed from the jump
How you say that I leave you? (Huh?)
How you say that I left you?
First year was the best you (Yeah)
After all the dumb shit that you did
Can't believe that I really kept you (Damn)
We used to sit in the same room
And I still probably would text you (No)

She ain't never gon' talk back
Gettin' big money, that's a tall bag (Yeah)
Go to Bergdorf, spend a small bag
Look at my back, Chrome Heart tags (Woah)
Louis V like I'm Virgil, got the all-white, told the bitch Off that (Let's go)
Pulled up in the Lam', it was manual, I had to stall that
I just made ten M's today, bitch, that's all facts
Call my phone, don't answer me, then I told the girl don't ball back (Hello?)
Drip, splash, I can just sauce that (Woah)
Yeah, I pick the bitch up
But I made her walk back (Yup)
You might also like
All my niggas got the tools
So you need a hard hat
They ain't even know it's me
'Cause I had a skull cap (Bitch, no)
Slime snake my disease (Slatt)
If you bite, I bite back (Woah)
Had this bitch on her knees
Asked her where her jaw at (Ooh)
Hello? (Hello?), hold on
Baby, gotta call back
'Cause I ran into a lick (Give me that)
And I need all that (Yeah)
Murakami on my walls (Ooh)
Nigga, where your KAWS at? (Wow)
I just beat a nigga up
Now I need my paws back (Yup)
Got a Glock with a dick
Yeah, I had to pause that (Pause)
When I'm shopping, know I'm safe
So I'm in the mall strapped
Diamonds all up in her face (Bling, baow, baow, bling)
Make a bitch percolate
Put her on ElimiDate
Been fucked, boy, you late (Woah)
She ain't never gon' talk back
Gettin' big money, that's a tall bag (Yeah)
Go to Bergdorf, spend a small bag
Look at my back, Chrome Heart tags (Yeah)
Louis V like I'm Virgil, got the all-white, told the bitch Off that (Off it)
Pulled up in the Lam', it was manual, I had to stall that (Let's go)
I just made ten M's today, bitch, that's all facts
Call my phone, don't answer me, then I told the girl don't ball back (Woah)
Drip, splash, I can just sauce that (Sauce it)
Yeah, I pick the bitch up
But I made her walk back (Walk)

Yeah, chain gang
Diamonds in my chain hang
Diamonds in my chain swing (Woah)
I'm just tryna maintain (Vroom)
Now I'm talking 'bout the fame (Yeah)
Fucking with my fucking brain (Let's go)
I can go in any lane (Woah)
Tear that bitch up out the frame (Yeah)
Hotbox a Mulsanne (Woah)
I just gotta ventilate (Woah)
I just got a new Range (Woah)
Yeah, it came with different plates
One, two, three, four
Skip the six, skip the eight
Then I skip the shit to ten
Run from 12, and I'm straight
You ain't never reach your day
You can't go where I go, you can't stay where I stay (Stay)
Her nigga in the way
Picked her up in my Rolls (Woah)
She don't know where I stay, fucked that girl on vacay, yeah
No, she ain't never gon' talk back
Gettin' big money, that's a tall bag
Go to Bergdorf, spend a small bag
Look at my back, Chrome Heart tags
Louis V like I'm Virgil, got the all-white, told the bitch Off that (Let's go)
Pulled up in the Lam', it was manual, I had to stall that
I just made ten M's today, bitch, that's all facts
Call my phone, don't answer me, then I told the girl don't ball back (Hello? Okay)
Drip, splash, I can just sauce that (Let's go)
Yeah, I pick the bitch up
But I made her walk back (Walk)

Yeah, I picked the bitch up
And I made her walk back24Embed
