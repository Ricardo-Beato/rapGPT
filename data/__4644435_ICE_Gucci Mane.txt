37 ContributorsICE Lyrics
It's Gucci
Huh
It's DropTop, go

Niggas say no cap, but they be pretending (Huh?)
FaceTiming my jeweler, ask him what I'm spending (Damn)
Take a couple seats 'cause this a couple tickets (Facts)
I never lie to kick it, murderer but not convicted
They say I'm filthy rich, I told the judge, 'Yeah, I'm guilty'
Fuck my baby mama, I can't let no bitch extort me (No)
All this ice I'm rocking, pray to God they don't deport me (ICE)
Five with the fuck you, Zone 6 nigga worth a fortune

Copped the Z06 and then I set it on some Forgis
Lam' truck came from Italy, my manager got it imported (On God)
We done set the city on fire the whole world call us arsons (Damn)
Paint the Rolls Royce truck all blue, me and Baby ridin' down Slauson
Last year I signed for six M's, bitch, can't tell me nothin' (Nope)
My new bitch look like K, Kim, ass fat with no stomach (Yeah)
Go all out 'bout that cash, yeah, chop his finger like Sunny
So all my foreigns go fast, yeah, drive the Urus like Sunny
My wrist cost a hundred, yeah, my life so iconic
Used to rock Armani, now it's Michael Amiri on Sundays (Yeah)
I fuck her and keep her cummin', got that pussy wet, drippin', runnin'
Spend a whole bag in London, I done really got used to this money (Go)
You might also like
Niggas say no cap, but they be pretending (Huh?)
FaceTiming my jeweler, ask him what I'm spending (Damn)
Take a couple seats 'cause this a couple tickets (Facts)
I never lie to kick it, murderer but not convicted
They say I'm filthy rich, I told the judge, 'Yeah, I'm guilty'
Fuck my baby mama, I can't let no bitch extort me (No)
All this ice I'm rocking, pray to God they don't deport me (ICE)
Five with the fuck you, Zone 6 nigga worth a fortune

I come from the trenches, now I'm ridin' in a foreign
Baby mama textin' paragraphs, I ignore it
And I ran a M up off a freestyle with no chorus
The drip shit, I pour it, that Hellcat, I floor it (Skrrt)
They was hatin' on me, hit the dealership and crushed 'em
Bankroll too big, got me held up in customs
Money is the answer every time she ask questions
I got superpowers 'cross the globe, I can touch 'em
That's your girlfriend? I am sorry, we've been fucking
Cullinan truck, come through like a bucket
I keep that FN, I go for nothing
If he out of line, get him dropped, end discussion (Go)

Niggas say no cap, but they be pretending (Huh?)
FaceTiming my jeweler, ask him what I'm spending (Damn)
Take a couple seats 'cause this a couple tickets (Facts)
I never lie to kick it, murderer but not convicted
They say I'm filthy rich, I told the judge, 'Yeah, I'm guilty'
Fuck my baby mama, I can't let no bitch extort me (No)
All this ice I'm rocking, pray to God they don't deport me (ICE)
Five with the fuck you, Zone 6 nigga worth a fortune (Wop)2Embed
