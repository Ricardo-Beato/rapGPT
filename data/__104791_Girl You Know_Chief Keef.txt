7 ContributorsGirl You Know Lyrics
I'm sitting in my Lam', smokin' palm trees
Girl, you be stunting, you can get about me
I gotta hit the mall, bitch, I like to stunt
And I gotta get high so number two up on the blunt
And them bitches scream "Musubi", everywhere we go
And I'm Chief Keef, shawty
Yes, I get a lot of hoes

And girl you know, I gotta get some dough
I gotta hit a stain, I can't walk around broke
Man, I'm in a daze, sippin' on lean
On my way to get some cash
Shawty gon' for the the team

Where I'm from, we get it, get it in
And I'm 9 to 5, shawty, while you niggas minute men
She say she dig my steelo but bitch I'm in a rush
And I got five niggas, so bitch you finna bust
Let's talk 'bout that mula, I love it with my heart
He too busy finding Nemo, while I'm swimmin' with the shark
I'm livin' in the dark, but my mind is a stain
If you disrespect the Wic, all you hear is "Bang, bang"
You might also like
Girl, you know, I gotta get some dough
I gotta hit a stain, I can't walk around broke
Man, I'm in a daze, sippin' on lean
On my way to get some cash
Shawty gon' for the the team

Feeling drunk 'cause I ain't feeling shit
Chief Keef motherfucka, and my niggas feeling it
And my music got the bitches steady rockin'
If a nigga talking shit, we can get it 'fetti poppin'
She dig me like I'm famous, saw them bitches wavin'
If a nigga try to touch me, crossed his ass like amen
F-L-Y, haters screamin' "Ah man."
Guys just poked the plug, got my niggas ballin''

Girl, you know, I gotta get some dough
I gotta hit a stain, I can't walk around broke
Man, I'm in a daze, sippin' on lean
On my way to get some cash
Shawty gon' for the the team1Embed
