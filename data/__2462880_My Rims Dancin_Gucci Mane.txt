A Black ass nigga in a red Phantom
I might be ugly, but my car handsome
I might can't dance, but my rims can
Hit the break, urt skrt rims dancin'
A stock Porsche Carrera, I'mma paint it orange
It might be hood, but it's still foreign
I might be rollin' on one of them thangs
A candy painted six, sittin' on them thangs (Gucci!)
Hummer truck or drop top, I got choices
Rims all white, same color forces
Lamb so low, it's like it's snorklin'
My very freaky girl and it's insides are gorgeous

My Rims are dancing like a go-go dancer
One's goin' forward and one's goin' backwards
Put your fingers down there'll chop your damn hands up
Gave my rims a tip because they're real good dancers

A Black ass nigga in a old school classic
I pulled up to club Gucci Mama doin' the pool palace
And now they doin' the snake and cabbage patchey
Sittin' on davins, watch me spin backwards
My rims are strippers and they dancin' nasty
If you wanna pair, then you know you gotta cash-in
You need a motor run, a new transmission
Homeboy, you're trippin', your car game, is slippin'
This card right here, it doesn't have a limit
Gucci is a trapstar; how did Gucci get it?
A drop Ferrari and it sure ain't rented
Ask me where I bought it from, where other niggas can't get it
You might also like
My Rims are dancing like a go-go dancer
One's goin' forward and one's goin' backwards
Put your fingers down there'll chop your damn hands up
Gave my rims a tip because they're real good dancersEmbed
