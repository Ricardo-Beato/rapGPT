13 ContributorsCame from Scratch Lyrics
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

Woo, uh, I made a million off scratch (Scratch)
Then put this drip in the bag (Drip)
Came for the modelin' bitches, no Nats (No Nats)
The lean by the bottle, no tax (Drank)
12 think the coupe was hijacked (Hijack)
Back in the day, I was into that (Into that)
Now the bags come in by the max

Ayy, ayy, came from scratch
Ayy, ayy, came from scratch
Ayy, ayy, raise your racks
Ayy, ayy, raise your racks
Ayy, ayy, came from scratch
Ayy, ayy, came from scratch
Ayy, ayy, raise your racks
Ayy, ayy, raise your racks, ayy

Nah, I'm not into pitty pat (Nah)
Nah, I'm not into internet (Nah)
Get it, young nigga, go scratch that (Scratch that)
Comin' up on the North, he won't last, yeah (Nah)
My wrist baguetty blasted (Blasted)
My bitch fleek with the lashes (Fleek)
My gang, they put you in caskets (Gang)
We kill 'em with whips and fashion (Whip)
McLaren, the Benz, the Lambo I'm smashin'
Pullin' out of the mansion (Skrrt)
In the Maybach, relaxin' ('Laxin')
But the Demon, the 'Cat are the fastest (Nyoom)
You think that it's a fantasy (Woo), the way that my salary cappin' (Cappin')
Me and Guwop, we be laughin' (Haha), they wanna be partners again, they relapsin'

Man, I seen it from a mile away, they tryna get some clout (Clout)
I know what you about ('Bout), I know without a doubt (Doubt)
I dropped the top, I know it's one, no need to cut it out (Huh?)
The money what it's 'bout ('Bout)
My bitch bag cost a house (Guwop)
I shine too hard, offend folks without even openin' my mouth (Huh?)
I needed folks, they left me dead, they kicked me, I was down (Damn)
Picked myself up off the ground, the blue cheese bailed me out (Honest)
My bank roll is on gout right now, so sick, can't leave the house (Egh)
Some leeches tried to ride my wave, but all of them wiped out (Wiped)
My house so big I got lost, couldn't even find my way around (Where?)
Some haters played some games with me, but now they in the ground (Ground)
Dirty money, Gucci Mane, no hundreds in the ground (Guwop)

Ayy, ayy, came from scratch
Ayy, ayy, came from scratch
Ayy, ayy, raise your racks
Ayy, ayy, raise your racks
Ayy, ayy, came from scratch
Ayy, ayy, came from scratch
Ayy, ayy, raise your racks
Ayy, ayy, raise your racks
Ayy, ayyEmbed
