57 ContributorsLimitless Lyrics
You the man, you know you the man
Rollie on your hand, it's the jam
Just don’t give a damn
Coolin' with the fam goin' ham
Fly to Vegas, get the band
Haters hate me, but they stan
’Cause the things they wish they could they know I can, goddamn

You the man, you know you the man
Rollie on your hand
You the man, you know you the man
Just don't—just don't—just don't give a damn
Coolin'—coolin' with the fam, goin' ham
Now they all know who I am, now they all know who I am
You the man, you know you the man
Rollie on your hand
You the man, you know you the man
Just don't—just don’t—just don’t give a damn
Coolin'—coolin’ with the fam, goin' ham
Now they all know who I am, now they all know who I am

Goddamn, this shit been the plan, do it 'cause I can
Made more money than 99 percent do in they lifespan
Fuckin' hand reachin’ up at night, I do not give a damn
Spend a lot to make a lot and then we do that shit again
1967 Bronco pull up like I serve that blanco
1-800 made my bank account look like a phone number
Your career goin' under, I'm top five that's alive, that's no lie
You ain't in the conversation, couldn't make it if you tried
If you ain't droppin' shit like all the time
Then people think you died
Shit too easy for my blood, they quick to leave you crucified
Shit ain't work out with my last, TMZ act like I lied
Called Jermaine for some advice
'Cause these people think I'm careless
He said, "Bobby, on the real, man, fuck 'em all
You should care less"
You might also like
You the man, you know you the man
Rollie on your hand (Oh you so care—)
You the man, you know you the man (Oh you so, oh you so careless)
Just don't—just don't—just don't give a damn
Coolin'—coolin' with the fam, goin' ham
Now they all know who I am, now they all know who I am (Goddamn)
You the man, you know you the man
Rollie on your hand
You the man, you know you the man
Just don't—just don't—just don't give a damn
Coolin'—coolin' with the fam, goin' ham
Now they all know who I am, now they all know who I am

Now they all know who I am, the fuckin' man
I'ma get it like that, baby girl, now tell me, do you understand?
I swear, my only motivation is your elation, I feel the sensation
Baby girl, be patient, my heart is racing
She keep on telling me she promise she ain't never done this before
I said, "I know that's a lie, but I love when you try
And I just can't live without it
Even the thought of you leaving, I can't think about it"

You say, you say, you say
You know you the man, you know you the man
You the only man who truly understands
I said I know I'm the man, yeah, I know I am
Ain't no doubt about it
Every single move I make, they always seem to write about it
That's why I never leave the compound
Always up inside it, I ain't never in the streets
When I am, they come runnin' to the boy, to the boy
I got way too many people nowadays I'm tryna avoid
I ain't been on the 'Gram in months, that shit get me too annoyed
All the weed inside these blunts
Got me feelin' paranoid like, 'noid like
Yeezy, Bobby, take it easy, my dawg
Why you always make it look so easy, my dawg?
Yeah, these haters talking shit, but success is my shield
Scarecrow flow, I'm outstanding in my field
I just texted J. J Abrams on some million dollar shit
Yeah, my movie gon' be crazy, first I gotta polish shit
Schoolin' all you fuckin' rappers, this right here the scholarship
If my presence near your presence
Then you best acknowledge it, bitch
You the man, you know you the man
Rollie on your hand
You the man, you know you the man
Just don't—just don't—just don't give a damn
Coolin'—coolin' with the fam goin' ham
Now they all know who I am, now they all know who I am
You the man, you know you the man
Rollie on your hand
You the man, you know you the man
Just don't—just don't—just don't give a damn
Coolin'—coolin' with the fam goin' ham
Now they all know who I am, now they all know who I am

Now they all know who I am26Embed
