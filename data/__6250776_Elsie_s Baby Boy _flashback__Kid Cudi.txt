I'm never gonna get out of this town, am I, Gordie?
You can do anything you want, man
Yeah, sure, I’ll see ya
Not if I see you first

He had one older sister
Two older brothers
And a single-parent mother who
Worked her ass off, did the best she could
There was nothing they could tell him
Let the boy know he wasn't worthless
Even though he was in the same home
He had felt alone, his pet gerbil passed on

He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie's baby boy
He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie’s baby boy
You might also like
By the time he was eleven
His father had left him
White church, sitting in the front row
All-white casket closed, he won't see him no more
He tried to disguise himself
Made sure that no one could tell
That in his soul, there's a wide-open hole
Something scarred him, so he can't let him go
He won't

He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie's baby boy
He was so bored in the winter
So bored in the winter
He was so bored in the winter
Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie's baby boy8Embed
