6 ContributorsJenifa (Taught Me) (12â€³ version) LyricsMASE:
This song does not contain explicit lyrics, but the thought is erotic. Awwww, baby!
DOVE:
Access to her code
Lovestruck Dove is Dove's mode
Took a look, dropped my books
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Breakfast was our greeting
Yogurt to verse is what I fed
Slipped a note, rocked my yacht
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Jenny, only thought about Jenny
But didn't think about Derwin
The Jimmy who's only a virgin
Steady we go, Jenifa led
Plug and a tune was freedom well said
So what's the fix, oh Jenifa
Can a brother the soul get swingin'?
POS:
The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the breaks, found her shape
Jenifa, oh Jenny
You might also likeTranscripts showed more than flirt
'I love daisies' read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Marvelous
Shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for Pos
Found a house, aroused my joust
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like Dan I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried 'kick it'
Posdnuos was in
Jenny, only thought about Jimmy
But asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin?
She said 'Let's try it in the bathroom'
But 'Dnuos is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did Dan
And came back wrapped in Saran
DOVE:
Positions, muscles flexed
Dove was lost in a Ghana hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Notions soothed the mood
Dove was lost in De La heaven
Screwed Plug Two, did the do
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Jenny teased my homeboy Granny
In fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool
Did her thing while I plugged once
Hope she don't fall fat nine months
From now, I'll tell you what
Trugoy ain't ready
POS:
Warned out was my cater
My new dis was three days later
The door turned blue, you guess who
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Advance to the radio
Teddy persuaded us to turn off the light
Wanted me to rhyme while she
Wrapped me up in a ball of twine
No more, I dispatched
Was it Jimmy had met his match
Or could it be the realisation
All girls owned a Jenny
For normal health I had fought
A valuable lesson she had taught
Don't flaunt that the candy is good
Unless you came with plentyEmbed
