7 ContributorsSmart Mouth Lyrics
Smart mouth (x4)
She  fat ass, but got a smart mouth
Smart mouth (x4)
I guess I'll hit right on the couch she got the smart mouth

She's a straight A student she's a smart mouth
Best brain in the college got the smart mouth
She suck it slow she suck it fast she got a wild mouth
She  how she talk, she got a foul mouth
She gets me one more time Im'ma pull her out
Gucci Mane they just let me out
Love me now or love me not
 and a rolex watch
Show love, I fuck you're bitch in your own car
Home run, I shot him with his own gun


Rich niggas don't talk too much, broke niggas 
She on the crutch can't walk too much, I'll kill you for just 
Smoke kush , 
Got a trap house and a record label, got a half of brick on my dinner table
A nigga tell on his momma, a nigga tell on his auntie
A nigga cut off his right hand, send the bottle to the white man
Before I could sing my ABC's, I had a AK
Before I could count through one, two, three, I had a trey eight
Can't cook roast, but I cook dope
A hundred P's of the good smoke
If you play here, don't pay me, drop neck on your head 'till your neck broke
Cadillac with them straps in it, show jeans with them racks in it
This business with that business, but I settle for the crack business
