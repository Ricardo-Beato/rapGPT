35 ContributorsPray for a Key Lyrics
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

Used to pray for a key, ask God to send me a bird
Got the drop on my opps, I'm never gon' say a word
It's time to go berserk, I've been dying to go berserk
Grey Poupon, spillin' wine on your shirt
Went on a stain, after I hit it, had to go to church
Selling cocaine, cookin' up chickens, don't nobody care
And I done spent countless nights workin' inside the kitchen
Drivin' in the car, smoke an ounce in sixty minutes
Used to pray for a key, ask God to send me a bird
Got the drop on my opps, I'm never gon' say a word
It's time to go berserk, I've been dying to go berserk
Grey Poupon, spillin' wine on your shirt
Went on a stain, after I hit it, had to go to church
Selling cocaine, cookin' up chickens, don't nobody care
And I done spent countless nights workin' inside the kitchen
Drivin' in the car, smoke an ounce in sixty minutes

Smoking green loud, grape Gushers, yeah
Hangin' in the trap where I learned to hustle, yeah
Flex, I done doubled up my cup
Can't explain the way I grind, can't explain it (Don't change up)
Sold nickles, sold dime bags, now I'm famous
Been posted up with the murder squad, we're all hangin'
Stayed low in the cut, had to fake it 'til a nigga made it (I did)
I'm the same nigga I've been, every single day, I'm gettin' faded
I was gettin' it in times ten when the police raided
Soon as I elevated, finessin' went elegant
They can't tell I was vicious when I was treacherous
I could've failed, I turned it up and went executive, yeah (Pluto)

Got the drop on my opps, I'm never gon' say a word
It's time to go berserk, I've been dying to go berserk
Grey Poupon, spillin' wine on your shirt
Went on a stain, after I hit it, had to go to church
Selling cocaine, cookin' up chickens, don't nobody care
And I done spent countless nights workin' inside the kitchen
Drivin' in the car, smoke an ounce in sixty minutes

Order up six hundred bottles and sixty bitches
I been havin' bitches starstruck, don't get in your feelings
I been countin', oh yeah, I'ma keep it a trillion (Yeah)
Changing up velocity because of curiosity
I had to kill the cat, I'ma tell the truth
Five-star bitch wearing all white and I got it (Murder)
Kept it true, dressed her up like a stylist (Murder)
Pick any car you want just like you hit the lottery (Woah, woah)
Diamonds are forever for you, yes, an eternity (Woah, woah)
Niggas can't be fucking with you, they're just like burnin' me (Woo)
Need a down bitch that can transport a kilo (Super)
I need a down bitch, purse fat like a sumo (Ayy)
Keep it one thousand

Used to pray for a key, ask God to send me a bird
Got the drop on my opps, I'm never gon' say a word
It's time to go berserk, I've been dying to go berserk
Grey Poupon, spillin' wine on your shirt
Went on a stain, after I hit it, had to go to church (Go to church)
Selling cocaine, cookin' up chickens, don't nobody care
And I done spent countless nights workin' inside the kitchen
Drivin' in the car, smoke an ounce in sixty minutes
