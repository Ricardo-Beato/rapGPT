Yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah, yeah

I don't trust niggas, I ride by myself, all I need is my strap and my armor (Buck, buck)
All I can see is these fuck niggas, it must be somethin' they put in the water (Buck, buck, buck)
I quit my job at McDonald's and built an empire and now I'm a gold mine (Hey)
Nothing was handed, I dreamed it, I did it, been wantin' this shit for my whole life (Buck, buck)

Move, move, move, get out the way, nigga bossed up (Buck)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I just got laid, I'm gettin' sauced up
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gotta go up 'til I motherfuckin' lift-off
Wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-one, nigga, I can't believe I done made it this far (Hey)

You know you too lit when you stretchin' these bands
You know you on top when your enemies fans (Buck)
You know you too blessed when they think you a threat
Try and aim for your neck, but I never be scared
Niggas on drugs, I was packin' all the work
Couldn't find a spot, we was trappin' out the church
Boost mobile phones had me waitin' for the chirp
Fresh to death, I was waitin' for the hearse
Casket fresh, had the weight goin' crazy (Ooh)
Show up to your door like the Avon lady
I could be the GOAT but the hate won't save me
If niggas hate me, then they hate Tom Brady
Go against the grain then you gotta be brave
She don't like me then she gotta be gay
To take me down then you gotta be paid
There ain't enough money I gotta be paid (Woo, woo, woo)

Ayy, ayy, ayy, gotta go up 'til I motherfuckin' lift-off
Wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-one, nigga, I can't believe I done made it this far (Hey)

Can't touch me when I'm in my zone
Came too far to sell my soul
When you gon' give me the respect I'm owed?
When you gon' watch my dreams unfold?
When I'm on tour, I just wanna be home
When I'm at home, I just wanna be alone
Me and my niggas still share the same clothes
When you got brothers, man, anything goes
Pull a bitch here like clickbait, ayy (Woo)
ADHD, can't see straight, ayy (Yeah)
Work a lil' job, I was still outside like, "Please will you listen to my mixtape, huh?"
Please will you listen to my mixtape, ayy?
Still can't listen what a bitch say, ayy
Niggas switched up, that's a mistake, ayy
Never thought I'd see this day, ayy (Buck, buck)
I don't trust niggas, I ride by myself, all I need is my strap and my armor (Buck, buck)
All I can see is these fuck niggas, it must be somethin' they put in the water (Buck, buck, buck)
I quit my job at McDonald's and built an empire and now I'm a gold mine (Hey)
Nothing was handed, I dreamed it, I did it, been wantin' this shit for my whole life (Buck, buck)

Move, move, move, get out the way, nigga bossed up (Buck)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I just got laid, I'm gettin' sauced up
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gotta go up 'til I motherfuckin' lift-off
Wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-one, nigga, I can't believe I done made it this far (Hey)3Embed
