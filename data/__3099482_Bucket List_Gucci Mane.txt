Bucket list
Cut it up
Huh
It's Gucci
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

Fuckin' Wop on her bucket list, I flex so effortless
Fuckin' twins and they goin' in like they ain't relatives
There's a slim chance that she may get this dick, like one percent
I'm so arrogant right now, man, I don't even want the bitch
Right back, scoopin' my dog from prison on my bucket list
Know they goin' so hard in the yard if they listen to this
Goin' quadruple platinum, that's not on my bucket list
Bitch, my Rollie went quadruple platinum, you should see this shit
It's no way possible I'm falling off, that don't exist
I wasn't rappin', I'd be sellin' narcotics just to pay the rent
That new Lambo on my bucket list so I just bought that bitch
It ain't a chick I feel that I can't get, man, that's that sucker shit

Bucket list, drop top 'Rari, scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, mega mansion scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, super bad bitch and she rich like Gucci rich
Bucket list, no more sellin' bricks, that's off my bucket list
Bucket list, drop top 'Rari, scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, mega mansion scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, super bad bitch and she rich like Gucci rich
Bucket list, no more waitin' to get that off my bucket list

Big boss business, quarter million on a pendant (brr)
Eight figure nigga, realest nigga in the business
Sittin' front row, freshest nigga in attendance
Gave a thousand dollars to the valet attendant
They ain't seen a player like me in a minute
Fuck your award, I don't even wanna win it
Rich hood dick, every singer wanna get it
Real authentic, everybody wanna live it
How a white man gon' criticize me 'bout reppin' these streets?
Man, fuck you critics
Change my name to "The best that did it"
Gucci turnt up, nigga just admit it
If I don't go gold I ain't fucked up 'bout it
With all this gold draped on my body (brr)
When I get married, that's a gangster wedding
Call my reception the gangster party

Bucket list, drop top 'Rari, scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, mega mansion scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, super bad bitch and she rich like Gucci rich
Bucket list, no more sellin' bricks, that's off my bucket list
Bucket list, drop top 'Rari, scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, mega mansion scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, super bad bitch and she rich like Gucci rich
Bucket list, no more waitin' to get that off my bucket listEmbed
