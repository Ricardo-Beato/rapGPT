2 ContributorsSleepinâ€™ In My Nikes Lyrics
Dedicated to the homeboy Seag
R.I.P. to the homeboy Seag
Still ridin' though (Still ridin')
Still ridin'

Watch out for the police, mayne, 'cause they after a motherfucker
Yeah, nigga
Once again it's that nigga named Seag in the motherfuckin' house
You know what I'm sayin'
And my realities is the next nigga's nightmares
You know what I'm sayin'?
Keepin' it real
69 Ville
For life, nigga

Uh, spent 75 on some cakes
Straight raw, 2.2 was each weight
And fuck the law, niggas on my beeper wanna get hooked up
The cola's in the beaker with the soda gettin' cooked up
It's all about makin' G's, I'm the man
27 in the OZ's, the bag weighs a gram
Walk a tight rope 'cause the feds is watchin' me
'Cause I'm slingin' more dope than a pharmacy
I got it on wholesale, takeover's the target
Straight snow sale, nigga, floodin' the market
And I can give a fuck, nigga, if you wanna tussle
Jealous of my figures, you're best to check your hustle
We can get down if you run up
I'm from the Town where niggas get down from sundown to sun up
Gotta watch my back, niggas creepin' in the strike zone
Always got my gat, they got me sleepin' with my Nikes on
You might also like
Every day and night
Livin' in the life
They got me sleepin' in my Nikes
It's do or die against my rivals
I could give a fuck 'cause it's all about survival, uh, uh
Every day and night
Livin' in the life
They got me sleepin' in my Nikes
It's do or die against my rivals
I could give a fuck 'cause it's all about survival

Fuck it, I'm high, mentally stuck, do or die
Who the fuck am I? A young killer on the rise
Look in my eyes, you see the vision of a nigga
Feelin' trapped in his inner self (It's fuckin' with my mental health)
Born in the city where the niggas die young
Mist-covered street corners collapsed where I slung
And everybody standin' stiff waitin' on the cake
I'm waitin' on a motherfuckin' break, ain't no escape
Make no mistakes and leave a motherfucker breathin'
They all got to die this evening, 'cause I believe in
You kill a motherfucker 'fore a nigga come through
With his crew makin' your nightmares come true
Now who gon' be the first to die
'Cause I'd extinguished your whole clique
Gimme the money, nigga, no shit
I'm in your spot with a Glock, down to bomb
On any nigga needin' bomb, sleep with your motherfuckin' Nikes on
Every day and night
Livin' in the life
They got me sleepin' in my Nikes
It's do or die against my rivals
I could give a fuck 'cause it's all about survival, uh, uh
Every day and night
Livin' in the life
They got me sleepin' in my Nikes
It's do or die against my rivals
I could give a fuck 'cause it's all about survival

Gots to watch these pirates tryna get my treasure
I don't know why it's, but police pressure
Got me feelin' like a zero, mayne, no good
But I'm knowin' I'm a hero, mayne, in my hood
Now I'm havin' dreams of firin' at them lames
I used to have dreams of retirin' from the game
Now as fast as I got it, I'ma lose it
See, the cash and narcotics, uh, made me ruthless
Timer know the real, they heard the situation
About the drama in the Ville, I'm third generation
Now they wanna put a jacket on my risen hustle
'Cause I couldn't hack it livin' in the struggle
Now I live every minute like my last one
Labeled a menace and a threat, and I'ma blast 'em
Greet you like a smile where the lights is on
And if you're livin' like me, you better sleep with your Nikes on
Every day and night
Livin' in the life
They got me sleepin' in my Nikes
It's do or die against my rivals
I could give a fuck 'cause it's all about survival, uh, uh
Every day and night
Livin' in the life
They got me sleepin' in my Nikes
It's do or die against my rivals
I could give a fuck 'cause it's all about survival, uh, uh
Every day and night
Livin' in the life
They got me sleepin' in my Nikes
It's do or die against my rivals
I could give a fuck 'cause it's all about survival, uh

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
Keep your motherfuckin' eyes focused, mayne
On this motherfuckin' game out here
You know'm'sayin', 'cause it ain't no joke, mayne
You know'm'sayin', 'cause you never plan to fail
You fail to plan
You feel what I'm sayin'?
So keep it real, mayne
And keep your eyes open for these busters
And these snake-ass niggas, you know'm'sayin'?
Falsely advertisin' as a motherfucker homeboy, you know'm'sayin'?
These niggas gon' get they motherfuckin' character assassinated out here
You know'm'sayin', for perpetratin'
You feel what I'm sayin', nigga
