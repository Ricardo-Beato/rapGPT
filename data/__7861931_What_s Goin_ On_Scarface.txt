3 ContributorsWhat’s Goin’ On Lyrics
*Grunting*
*Laughing*
Uh, uh, uh, uh

It was a little nigga, he was about 12 in this story I tell
Bare with the OGs, so they taught him how to hustle, but now he sell
Rocks, at the dope spot, and then get hot
Get  with Glocks
Thang with a phony game, now he slang 'caine on the block
And not a problem, (Nigga) what you proud of?
Deep in this game your mama want you out of
And this shit won't stop until a nigga wanted by the cops
 you constantly getting rid of your rocks
Maybe  you smoke up all the keys
Steady did, watch when wolves turn to Gs
On top of these OGs got these ho's droppin' to they knees
But  to have ho's
 up and now I'm sold for the bankroll
Pullin' this gat and take yours
So, fuck the 5-0
But sold the fuck up on Gs luck say sluts get no trust with yo ducks
And came up, wow, hookin' up mom's now, for a while
Sonny didn't  drug money shit
But couldn't resist a slick fit
, in the living room
Soon seen 15, so quip for the head of the kid when it booms
To whom it may concern, niggas is gettin' burned
You creep the Ds up off your 
Gots your sister geeking, turned around
The hush, 'cause this shit was flush
Fuck a trust fund, Gs bring luck tonight
Young hustle on a young crack life, nigga
And that's the way it's going down
You might also like
What's going on?
As the world goes around and round
What's going on?
Young brother
As the world goes around and round
What's going wrong with your hustle?
As the world goes around and round
What's going on with the struggle?
As the world goes around and round
What's going on?
What's going on? (Better listen, listen)
