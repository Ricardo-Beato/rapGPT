Come on, baby
Come on, girl
Lemme rock your world
I'm probably gonna rock your world
I said come on, baby (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Come on, girl (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Lemme rock your world (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I'm probably gonna rock your world (Come on, come on, come on, come on)

So come on, baby
I've been lonely lately
So come on, hold me
And let's make a baby
I'm callin' my lady girl, I'm callin' my lady
Don't be shady, don't be shady, girl

Come on, baby
Come on, girl
Lemme rock your world
I'm probably gonna rock your world
I said come on, baby (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Come on, girl (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Lemme rock your world (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I'm probably gonna rock your world (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
You might also like
Lord knows I need you, girl
'Cause the hole in my heart could fill the world
So come on, baby, come on now
I was high as a kite
But like The Price Is Right, I'm comin' down
Girl, I'm comin', I'm comin' for you
And by the end of the night, you gon' be cummin' too
Uh, I said girl, I'm comin' (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Comin' for you (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
And by the end of the night, you gon' be cummin' too (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)

Come on, baby
Come on, girl
Lemme rock your world
I'm probably gonna rock your world
I said come on, baby (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Come on, girl (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Lemme rock your world (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I'm probably gonna rock your world (Come on, come on, come on, come on)3Embed
