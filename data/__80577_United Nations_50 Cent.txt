11 ContributorsUnited Nations Lyrics
Ah, I got big bags of paper I’mma spend
We gon' do it how we do it, then do the shit again
You should fuck with a winner bitch if you wanna win
We’re celebrating like a nigga home fresh out the pen

I’m on, bitches all on my John
To get bread and don’t blow bread, the fuck is the point
Call me Elroy, I be on some Jetson shit
Pop a x and the blue pill then wreck a bitch
I like it raw, uh baby, uh baby, I like it raw
Take a chill pill bright and early tomorrow
The morning after, plan b, no kids involved
Please no kids involved
I put that money in the vault bitch usain bolt
Progress…make a deal then blow mills for real
Time’s a wasting, you watching my watch, ha
You old school, huh, jocking my style

I don’t give a flying fuck, I always make bail
Motherfuck an award, check Forbes, i’m there
Not once, every year
Even when I take a break, my pockets is in shape
I’m back off a vacation
Can you believe it, I been getting paid on vacation
Yeah, i’ma keep niggas forever hating
They thought i’m going down
Now look, i’m levitating
I’m with Deepak meditating
In Somalia & Kenya with United Nations
Funding the world food program
Finna solve world hunger, god damn
