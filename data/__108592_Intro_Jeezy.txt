10 ContributorsIntro Lyrics
Let's go for another round
Trap or Die
CTE
The Aphilliates
(gangsta grillz)
Yall niggas didn't believe us
We had a goal in mind
Set the streets on fire
I think we accomplished that
(gangsta grillz)

Here I stand
A grown ass man
All by myself
A grown ass man
A young nigga with some grown ass plans
But don't point fingers
You don't know that man
You don't know his heart
You don't know his pain
You ain't lookin through that scope
You don't know his aim
Minus all the videos, stickers, and flyers
Most if these rappers are compulsive liars
You might also like
We make quality street music
Something you can ride to
I don't care what you represent


They can't help it
They need some help
Tell me what kind of nigga tells lies to himself
Them turns around and tell them same lies to his fans
Disney World niggas in fantasy land
I came to wake you niggas up
You must be dreaming
This shit ain't adding up
You ain't what you're seeming
You niggas out of order like soda machines
And jeezy keep the cola like soda machines
You ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white it'll hurt your eyes
I really lived it man
Counting so much paper it'll hurt your hands
From the trunks of the rental to the Greyhound Bus
The same old shit, an adrenalin rush
I tried to tell them people that the streets was watching
Same time be safe cuz them people is watching
Two hundred thousand mixtapes later
From the streets of the 'Chat
To the hoods of Decatur
Same young nigga made a killing with the snow
Turned right around and made a killing with the flow
The whole city at my shows
They recite my words
I guess they like the way that I recite them birds
Probably go to jail for some of the shit I said
Realest nigga ever done it
Breathing or dead
Two record deals
Radio still won't play me
But I don't give a fuck
Cuz the streets done made me
Said I was affiliated with all the gangstas and killers
Fuck you thought I was gonna do
Turn my back on my niggas?
Now I can't slow down
Thats too close to stopping
Got everybody asking when the album drop
The hottest nigga in the city with no radio play
When 'Let's Get It' drop
We'll see what you niggas will say
Trap or Die niggaEmbed
