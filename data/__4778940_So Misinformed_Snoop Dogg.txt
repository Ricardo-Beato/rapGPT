16 ContributorsSo Misinformed Lyrics
I would like to say to this gentleman and all other people who are not blessed with melanin at this point in time to understand that what has happened in our history is that you have been misinformed as much as we have been misinformed.
Much of the information that is brought forth, not only from Doctor Mohammed, but other areas, other scholars, are not available to you as a sister said in your curriculum that you've had for 400 years when you did not allow us to read and write, it was being hidden.
Whether you, sir, personally did that or not, it was a legacy that was passed onto you.
And I end by saying the Holocaust is simply the greatest atrocity on film.
Ours was not filmed.

(Get up, stand up) No apology, equality
(Stand up for your rights) Youth is future, let's move forward
(Get up, stand up) Healthy mentality helps sanity
(Stand up for your rights) Melting Pot, help us up, vote or not
(Get up, stand up) Facts half backwards and inaccurate
(Stand up for your rights) Tell folks no backin' up, track it up
(Get up, stand up) Good over evil, deceitful
(Don't give up the fight) Morals, principles, it's simple, son

What will it take for my peoples to connect together?
You know it's black excellence if we compete together
Picture a photograph of black folks lit together
In high definition, in high, I would never
Turn my back on the block, I got the block on my back
Like James Brown, boy, I'm proud to be black
To all my sisters, Mother Earth has birthed us
Lurchers, it hurts us first, less heard this
To all my sisters, ain't no knockin' you back
Politicans politickin' with a gown and a cap
The house got flavor and I like it like that
Black girl power, yeah, I'm rockin' with that
Doors is gettin' kicked down, statues is gettin' ripped down
Presidents meetin' overseas just to have a sitdown

They tryna keep us from runnin' up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up

(Get up, stand up) No apology, equality
(Stand up for your rights) Youth is future, lets move forward

So what are you saying?

The foundation was laid, y'all nation was made
Off our ancestors' back, back, back in the day
Four hundred years ago, y'all made us slaves
And you can hear it in the spirit comin' deep from the graves
Life is a maze
Smoke so much dope you in a daze
But you ain't trippin', you gettin' paid
Who do you praise? But anyways
I read a history book, but I ain't learned nothin', dawg
So I read the Bible, then the holy Quran
Went to Jamaica to acquire my knowledge
Sat with some Rastas 'til my game got polished
The gangbang extreme with malice
Trees and degrees like I'm trained for college
They tryna keep us from runnin' up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up
