Hey, hey
Uh, and it's the best day ever
Every now and again you gotta just
Just say somethin', somethin' real
'Cause, you know, you plan on changin' the world, that's—
When it's all said and done, it's more than just
More than just rap, it's deeper than that, let's do it

The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that

I got that money on my mind, the grind, and the ability
The knowledge and the know-how, stamina and the agility (Agility)
Soon as I step in the facility, these haters start testin' my civility
I'm tellin' ya, they killin' me (They killin' me)
Some of 'em feelin' me and some of 'em be grillin' me
But I just blow my kush smoke up to the ceilin', G (G)
Yeah, and take a toke of the Swisher smoke (Smoke)
They got the paint and the brush, but not the picture, loc (Loc)
What is an emcee if he can't rap? (Rap)
Just a monkey with a mic just waitin' to get slapped (Slapped)
And what is a DJ if he can't scratch? (Scratch)
The one rotten apple that's spolin' the whole batch (The whole batch)
What is a B-Boy if he can't break? (Break)
Might as well do the Dougie or even the Harlem Shake (The Harlem Shake)
And what is a graffiti artist if he don't tag?
No homophobia, but he's a fag
'Cause it's deeper than all that
You might also like
Some people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that (Look, look)

One time for the world 'cause we do it for y'all
Bat logo light up in the sky when the studio call
Movin' the crowd, get 'em loud without a gimmick
Spit with a golden ticket, I'm whippin' it up in minutes
My feet up in this game, you haven't even made a divot
Worried 'bout the critics, what's happenin' now, forget it
From my heart is where I give it, stay thinkin' 'bout the future
When I'm rich, I'ma call my mom before I call the movers
These haters just losers, hate to see you winnin'
Gave my all from the beginnin', I'm in it for extra innings
Here to change the world like I change clothes
Wouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos, but I'm right here for way more
What is somebody if they can't love? A hater, someone give 'em a hug, aha
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that
The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that6Embed
