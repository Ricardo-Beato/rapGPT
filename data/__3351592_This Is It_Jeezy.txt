10 ContributorsThis Is It Lyrics
This is it, it's a hit
This is it my nigga, this is it
Hit a lick, half a brick
Then I came right back, poppin' shit
This is it, it's a hit
This is it, my nigga, this is it
Hit a lick, half a brick
Then I came right back, talkin' shit

2 chains on me, I ain't Tity tho
Few niggas poppin, still my city though
And these new niggas? Yeah, they just new niggas
Snow work, I'm after them, some more new niggas
The champ here, yeah you niggas gon' fall back
Funny dressin' ass nigga, where you sold crack?
Them alternative facts, that's just a mystery
Bought my first 8-ball, the rest was history
Shit, hid it in the freezer, yeah that cold money
Rappin' ass nigga, flexin', show money
Bentley with the frogeye, got it out the mud
.40 with the red beam, brought it in the club

This is it, it's a hit
This is it, my nigga, this is it
Hit a lick, half a brick
Then I came right back, poppin' shit
This is it, it's a hit
This is it, my nigga, this is it
Hit a lick, half a brick
Then I came right back, talkin' shit

Look, 2017, they internet felons
Lot of dry snitchin', internet tellin'
Imaginary life, imaginary balls (facts)
They talkin' war wounds, imagine their scars
We call 'em clown niggas, wanna be down niggas (whatelse)
Light-skinned ass, wanna be brown niggas
Stay ridin' with that shit that push your face back
Have your homeboys askin' where your face at
And these rap niggas? Yeah, they just rap niggas
And when it's all over, they be rap niggas
Bentley with the frogeye, got it out the mud
.40 with the red beam, brought it in the club

This is it, it's a hit
This is it my nigga, this is it
Hit a lick, half a brick
Then I came right back, poppin' shit
This is it, it's a hit
This is it, my nigga, this is it
Hit a lick, half a brick
Then I came right back, talkin' shitEmbed
