Brick wall dedication
Mos Def affiliation
Attic representation
This is the phat presentation
De La's the foundation
Common Sense collaborations
Peace to all of you Haitians
Check it out, now

If money makes a man strange - we gots to rearrange that
So what makes the world go round?
If love is against the law - listen, I don't know
Gotta change how it's goin' down (Yeah, haha)
If money makes a man strange - yeah, we gots to rearrange that
So what makes the world go round?
And if love is against the law - listen, I don't know
Gotta change how it's goin' down (Haha, haha, check it out)

Fell in love with this fish who got caught in my mesh (What)
But yo she burned my scene up like David Koresh
I guess a diamond ain't nothing but a rock with a name
I guess love ain't nuttin but emotion and game
It's a lesson well learned, so praise is well due
I'm sendin' off from Big I, to Kenny Calhoun
And add a reservation for the resident crew
And yo, get your bowl cuz we cookin' up stew
See, them Cubans don't care what y'all niggas do (Word)
Colombians ain't never ran with your crew
Why you acting all spicy and shiesty?
The only Italians you knew was icees, niggas price me
I'm keepin it clean, like a washing machine
Ayo, get your locomotion running to full-steam
I'm sending out a greeting to my man Daseem
I got a child, so I gotsta get the green, right? (That's right)

If money makes a man strange - we gots to rearrange that
So what makes the world go round?
If love is against the law - listen, I don't know
Gotta change how it's goin' down (Haha)
If money makes a man strange - we gots to rearrange that
So what makes the world go round? (Yeah, yeah)
If love is against the law - listen, I don't know
Gotta change the way it's goin' down

Itzsoweezee, it's gettin hot this year
Itzsoweezee, it's gettin hot (It's gettin' hot, yeah)
(repeat 4X)

I own the deeds to some acres in the West Indies
Where my pops is building residence to house my seed
Now here's the lead, y'all niggas pray to hot rods and not God
While Versace play you bitches like Yahtzee
Crackin jokes like you Potsie
(When's the last time you had Happy Days?)
Blazin up your herb to escape the maze, but the problem stays
Think big, get it big is my motto
You can go and play your lotto, I'll be singin like baby won't you be mine
You'll be pressin rewind, you can never see mine
Keep your eyes focused, you can't touch this or quote this
Style is crazy bogus so you can't try to approach this
Stomp you out like roaches, pullin on my coattail
Like some horses pullin coaches, WHOA your roller coasters
It's hotter than the temperature that's cookin in your toasters
While the heat'll put you deep into hypnosis

Itzsoweezee, Enola in the area
Itzsoweezee, Timbo King's in the area
Itzsoweezee, Maseo's in the area
Itzsoweezee, ninety-six in your area
Itzsoweezee, lawd lawd lawd!
Itzsoweezee, lawd lawd lawd lawd
Itzsoweezee, lawd lawd, for y'all peace
Itzsoweezee
