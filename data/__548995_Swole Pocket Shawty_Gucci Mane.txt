Big Gucci

Yo boyfriend's a peon
He pull up in a neon neon
Got a L from a realm of free funds
I'm ridin' down east Ponce de leon a road in Atlanta
Your album was trashcan I roll weed on your album
I'm the first nigga in Atlanta put 6's on phantom (swish swish)
Big Shot
Try to turn your nose up you done missed out
Big Guwop (wop wop)
Bring trap rap back for hip hop (now now)
Don't fuck with yall niggas y'all niggas ball small I ball too large (word)
6 car garage cause all my cars got beat in em
And being in it with paint on em
It's so clean a ho might eat on it
I off a nigga from my office
Track ya ass like a tracklist grab ya ass like a chiropractor
Push yo neck and yo back and yo pelvis
I loan ya money with interest cause you ain't in my best interest
I left the clique with injuries better pray there were't no memories
I'm number one shoota come rent me I get a nigga wet for a small fee whack em
Smoke a nigga air like a half a p
Then pour me a big cup of coffee and I'm feelin' like Master P '93
Tellin yo bitch get off me

Swole Pocket Shawty
I wanna be your friend shawty
Tell that girl to come here darling
Go somewhere and have her own party
Now (now)
You listen, I'm talking
Whatchu gonna do with your friends, shawty?
Got one seat, and more ten, shawty?
You gonna choose me or choose them, shawty

I got that Kobe Bryant Smithn'Wesson
Shoot first I'm not askin' questions
You'd think this an ole Western
Cause I got my secret weapon (pow)
Lose your life a split second
Top drop off then boot 'n neck it
Molly got me energetic
Sport fuckin for fifty minute
My, my, my like new addition
Voice em in like Mike Duda
I sprung a Benz watchin' the Simpsons
On crib road I got cruel intentions hit El Manor took two capsules
In a fast chevelle with air condition
My can am faster then your grand am I don't give a goddamn
Shorts so tight how you get in 'em
I'm the phantom of the opera
Never met Oprah still ain't find Hoffa
And you don't look hopeful
Spiked out loafers
Mixin' up sodas Sprite so dark That it look like doda
Tryin' ta see how many
Y'all fit in my roller picked her up in the car
She ain't never seen Rover
Niggas is crazy
My watches by polar
I turn off my music to listen to my motor

*Getcha* *Getcha*Embed
