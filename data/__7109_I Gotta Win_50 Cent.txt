4 ContributorsI Gotta Win Lyrics
Yeah, this is what you call inner city blues
Now that I got you here I got your attention (I'm a winner winner)
I wanna welcome you all to the winner's circle

I'm a winner-winner, look I gotta win
After I win I got to win over again
Please don't confuse a nigga for a loser
Watch me maneuver with the Ruger
Look, I gotta win
I'm a winner-winner, look I gotta win
After I win I got to win over again
Please don't confuse a nigga for a loser
Watch me maneuver with the Ruger
Look, I gotta win

By any means, I'm a 7 or 11
Trip'-6 or a Cee-Lo, you ain't hear that from me though
My occupation's  Operation "Get money"
Got that beam on that 9, got that money on my mind
Got no patience, man, I grind like I'm running out of time
See the sunshine reflect off my shine, you're blind
You write hot lines like mine lines, you're signed
That bitch bad, her ass so fat glad she mine
I'm addicted to it, me I got to win
Over and over and over again
This quest for the paper is never gon' end
So to my competition here's the message I send
You might also like
I'm a winner-winner, look I gotta win
After I win I got to win over again
Please don't confuse a nigga for a loser
Watch me maneuver with the Ruger
Look, I gotta win
I'm a winner-winner, look I gotta win
After I win I got to win over again
Please don't confuse a nigga for a loser
Watch me maneuver with the Ruger
Look, I gotta win

Man, you ain't a shooter, you ain't a robber
You talk like a mobster you fucking blogger
I say some hard shit you wanna say somethin harder
Smack the shit out you, you wanna run to the law, huh?
This movie's a rerun, you seen this before
She used a vibrator and she suck on your boy
I stand out like a sore thumb, I'm hard to ignore
You get addicted to the dick then have to go through withdrawls
After I go through the drawers I'm back on my grizzly
Back getting busy causing a frenzy
It's nothing new to me, there's nothing they could do to me
That ain't been done to me - this is fun for me
I'm a winner-winner, look I gotta win
After I win I got to win over again
Please don't confuse a nigga for a loser
Watch me maneuver with the Ruger
Look, I gotta win
I'm a winner-winner, look I gotta win
After I win I got to win over again
Please don't confuse a nigga for a loser
Watch me maneuver with the Ruger
Look, I gotta win1Embed
