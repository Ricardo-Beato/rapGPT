15 ContributorsWord Play LyricsWhat it do
I ain't kill hip-hop nigga
Well, all the critics against you
But the streets love you

You niggas want word play
But I'm bout bird play
1st of the month
Yeah we call that bird day
(just look at em fly )
You niggas want word play
But I'm bout bird play
3rd of the month
Yeah we call that bird day
(just look at em fly )

I'm way too intelligent
To play with my intelligence
What you tryna tell me, what I'm saying's not relevant?
Still represent
Cause ima represent
3 bands for a 9 piece chicken dinner
Young bounce right back like a rubberband
Bought a whip look yall
No hands
Topless stop this
Where's your roof?
All this nonsense
There's no use
Married to the game
Yeah we just got a load
Depending on the shipment
We might need a boat
I'm talking big money
Anybody own a bank
Had to switch up the style
They was on to the tank
You might also like

Used to bet on all hip-hop
Young killed hip-hop
Don't you know this dumb nigga still talking crack rocks
Got everybody following him
Does that make him a leader?
Does that mean he needs to get indicted
Just to make you a believer
If that's the case
Then I really do apoligize
That I memorize
That I fantasized
That I visualized
That I strategize
1 false move will get your ass penalized
You can't be serious
What if pac was hearing this
You bullshitting me
I'm sure biggie would agree
If he had to pass the torch
Then that bitch would go to me
Now wouldn't you agree
It doesn't matter I accept

You ever seen a blue rolls
Caught in the black grass
Nigga go broke
And invest in a black mask
Entrepreneur
He found him a new craft
A round of applause
Congratulate that nigga
Cause when he get rich
You gon hate that nigga
I bet the haters try they best
Try to break that nigga
(fly)
How fly
(fly)
How fly
(fly)
How fly
(flyyyy)
