17 ContributorsOut the Bowl Lyrics
Uh, hold up hold up hold up
And my nigga Thug in this motherfucker
Turn it up, cut it up a little more
Feel like I'm sleepwalkin' (Yeah)
Sleep talkin'

Cut my bitch off, wash my dick off in a bitch mouth
Make her kiss your boy, you ain't ride, so you bitched out
Shawty so fine that I can’t put the bitch out
But she got me pissed off, damn I should have tricked off
Slick sauce on my clique boss, this ain't Kriss Kross
Brick loft, get it off like the real Rick Ross
1017 boss, bitch call me gold mouth
Big Guwop in the house and he showed out
Disrespect Brick Squad and you get drugged out
And every time I limp down the street, that’s a plug walk
Gucci used to be the shiznit, can he still lift?
Ten tell ten that I got your bitch ten pills
Telling everybody in the place, can’t sit still
Sorry to say that I know where your bitch live
Gucci used to be a rich man, and he still is
Bag came wrong, I'ma show them what the deal is
Rolling like motherfucker, 45 X pills
She make me say (My my my)  easy

Woah, woah, woah (Woah-woah, woah-woah)
We got that fish scale jumping out the bowl (Fish scale)
15 hundred comin' out a nigga's nose
Spend 30 thousand dollars on her clothes (Cash out today)
Woah, woah, woah (Yeah, baby)
We got that fish scale jumping out the bowl (Okay-kay)
15 hundred comin' out a nigga's nose (Yeah)
Spend 30 thousand dollars on her clothes (Yeah, Thugger)

Brand new Bentley, Young Thug gettin' it
Her hair extended, my clip extended
Me and her twinsies, Ferragamo and Fendi
Jimmy call for the Lindsay's, mouth gold, no penny
Gotta keep up my image, so therefore I got birds flying
Birds over your head, no pretending, I got plenty
Freeze, bitch, get in position
Knees, please, suck me 'til I'm empty
S-double-M, we gon' squeeze it 'til it's empty
They are like Arthurs, we are like Binkys
Thousand for my cologne, never catch me stinky
Ooh, look at her winky, at young me, oh my G

Woah, woah, woah (Woah-woah, woah-woah)
We got that fish scale jumping out the bowl (Fish scale)
15 hundred comin' out a nigga's nose
Spend 30 thousand dollars on her clothes (Cash out today)
Woah, woah, woah (Yeah, baby)
We got that fish scale jumping out the bowl (Okay-kay)
15 hundred comin' out a nigga's nose (Yeah)
Spend 30 thousand dollars on her clothes (Yeah, Thugger)9Embed
