And now, Kim and Cookie
Cookie: Ring-Ring
Kim: Say hello Cookie!
Cookie: Hello
Kim: Girl, I got something to tell ya
Cookie: Spill it girl, spill it
Kim: Remember ol' boi, at the club...
Cookie: From last night?
Kim: Last night!
Cookie: What's up?
Kim: Went home with the mothafucka, now I'm thinkin I'm fittin' to goddamn get my ass to' up!
(Background singers: To' up!)
Kim: But girl...
Cookie: What?
Kim: Dick so short!
(Short!) (*Woman laughing*)
Kim: He came quick, he got his, I ain't get mine, I'm like: fuck!
(Fuck!)
Kim: You know you talkin' all that goddamn shit and you ain't shit!
Cookie: Girl, you got you a mothafuckin minute man!
Kim: A minute mothafuckin man
(Mothafuckin minute man!)
Kim: But it's all good you hear me? Cause before I goddamn left this mothafucka, I hit this mothafucka up for everything, you hear me! I'm talkin 'bout wallet, I'm talkin 'bout credit cards, money. And you know what, I was gonna hit the motherfucker up for his goddamn pistol but I ain't know how many mothafuckin bodies he had on, that mothafucka, you feel me!
(I feel ya!)
Cookie: Well it's all good
