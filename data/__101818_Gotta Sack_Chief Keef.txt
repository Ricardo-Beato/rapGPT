I got a sack now (Sack)
Try us, it’s MAC rounds (That MAC)
Call us 30 clips, shawty, blow your back down (Back)
You can’t turn me down (Nah)

Since I got a name, you can check my background (Grrah)
Just ‘cause I rap now, can’t put that MAC down (Bang)
‘Cause I’m sacked up, try to rob me and get clapped down (Grrah)
