Danja!
With the most connected
And the most protected
Ya dig?

When you say my name, when you - when you say my name
When you say my name they gon' say (that's-that's the homie)
I'm connected everywhere, I'm-I'm connected everywhere (that's the homie)
Everywhere-everywhere, I'm-I'm-I'm connected everywhere (that's the homie)

Everywhere I go all of the people know my name
It's ya big homie Snoopy, just tell 'em you with me
I got a partner out in Vegas, hook up on the strippers
He likes to call them showgirls but Snoopy never tip her
Got a homie out in Reno, he likes to play Pokeno
You get that boy a 20 he'll turn that into a C-note
I'm known across the planet, you need that Southern fix?
I got a girl that looks like Janet, she out there in Atlanta
My boy out in the Chi-Town, hook up on apparel
Plus he'll cook you up some shit, he works the kitchen down at Harold's
My niggas out in Zone 6, soul food, no sushi mayne
Cookin up the whole thing for Snoop Dogg and Gucci Mane
My homegirls out in Brooklyn, bad lil' bitches
They boostin like crazy, put my fo' on 26's
You want it they can get it, they held me down for summers
It's half off on whatever, matter fact take down this number homie
You might also like

Everywhere I go all of the people know my name
It's ya big homie Snoopy, just tell 'em you with me
I got a homie out in Texas, club scene reckless
Mention Uncle Snoopy he can get you on the guestlist
Ridin through New Orleans, rest in peace Soulja
Slim, you need some trim, I've got some bitches in the 'Nolia
Catch me out in M-I-A, what you need a whole pound?
Little Haiti, Long Beach, Rollin 20, Zoe Pound
I got a couple killers, out in Pittsburgh
You need a nigga wrapped, you better whisper
I got what you need, you better know that shit
You tryin to pop a biz I'll put you with my Oakland bitch
I got some partners in Albuquerque, New Mexico
I say one word they hold your ass and never let you go
Don't you just sit and wonder, they held me down for summers
So when you see 'em comin, matter fact take down they number


Everywhere I go all of the people know my name
It's ya big homie Snoopy, just tell 'em you with me
I got a partner in Nigeria, man he got the heaters
Trade you Russian bullets for a new pair of sneakers
We up in Amsterdam, you like to spark a lot?
My boy he like to talk a lot, he own his own coffee shop
I got a homie in Japan, he always been a fan
Give you weed by the zip, or by the gram
Yeah... I had a homegirl in Pari'
'Til the bitch left her nigga now she wanna marry me
Got a homie in Australia, he showed me where to go
You know him as Gladiator, I call him Russell Crowe
I got a homie in Canada, 150 for a zone
He got the purple by the bundles, I'm still high when I get home
I'm well-connected fool, they held me down for summers
It's D-O-double G, matter fact take down my number homie
 - 1.5X

I'm connected everywhere, I'm-I'm connected everywhere (that's the homie)
Everywhere-everywhere, I'm-I'm-I'm connected everywhere (that's the homie)
I'm connected everywhere, I'm-I'm connected everywhere (that's the homie)
Everywhere-everywhere, I'm-I'm-I'm connected everywhere (that's the homie)

Just say Snoop Dogg and watch what they say
That's the homie, real talk, no matter where you go
City to city, flow to flow
Even in the penitentiary man
I'm the homie man, I be lookin out, youknow'mtalkinbout?
In the community, I be lookin out
In the churches I be lookin out
And if you don't look out
I'll be in yo' house, lookin out
Ya dig? Cause I am the homie, hehehe
Yeah, Bigg Snoop Dogg
Your friendly neighborhood Snoop DoggEmbed
