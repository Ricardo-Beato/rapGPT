13 ContributorsFast Money Lyrics
Hey now
What down joe?
What down what down
Hey now
I’m saying what’s the deal on that though
Hey now
I’m saying wh-what
Hey now
I’m saying man you want me to lay down or what man
Hey now
(Muffled)
Hey now
Hey listen c’mon man
Hey now

Uh
Sneakers beep a heater underneath the seam
On the jeans every time I hit the scene
Like Mira
Look at me crook I be
Like ya neck when you slept wrong the American dream
Don’t step on the block that I run
Block that I brung the first beamer that they’d ever seen on these
Wit with the rocks I sling like David
Fee Fi Fo Fum
By nature I’m a hustla
Move pack like I move and I’m packing
Y’all niggas move back on the come up like elevator action
Welcome to the action-packed world of trapping
Where we tip into Chi-Town if you cook a key you will see
If you chop the nickels that you can get a drop and a box of pistols
Have to get it cooked so you can not get little
Fast (echo)
Money (echo)
‘cause all my habits important
I kept the illest hoopers in high school and Jordans
Kept the illest rappers in the hood recording
See I keep it real no I no bluffin’
I got money but I no puff them
I re-up, remove weight like liposuction
Now follow a playa as I go hustling
For that fast
You might also like
Fast money baby
Money (echo)
Fast as it comes, the faster it go
When the closet close
Then you’re on your own check
Can you dig it baby?
Woooohooo!

Uh
Now let’s see what happens when a little mackin and a little Cadillacin’ get it crackalackin on the scene like shush
Rings gators on seen the suits when I swoop
Man I pack shit for a king
Such as I
Uh, uh you try
See, haters try to touch they uh, uh deny
This is not for the weak of heart like John Q
You’re just a John, too, that blonde who want you
I’m cut from a finer cloth
See it’s pimpin’ in my blood
Know how much that vagina costs
If a playa suspect the game gon’ reject him
Welcome to the world’s oldest profession
We running game in the Chi-Town
Most niggas lame cuz they can’t accept it
They can never understand so they can’t respect it
They can never feel my pain cuz they can’t connect with
Fast (echo)
Money (echo)
Pimp some hoes down
Why you trying to get that ho to swallow
If you get a brain then the hoes will follow
Uh, I keep it real see I know simpin’
I tell them what they want cuz I know women
They better have my cash, or I go tripping
Now follow a playa as I go hustling
For that fast
