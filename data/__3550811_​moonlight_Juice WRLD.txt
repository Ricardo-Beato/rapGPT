Yeah

Girl, you know I'm far from perfect, I won't lead you on
But tonight is feelin' perfect, this your favorite song
I know that mood right
I know that mood right, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh

Don't know when I met you, but I met you
Don't know why I love you, but I love you, oh
It's something 'bout that dress, the way it fits you
I don't even wanna tell you to take it off, but baby, take it off
We in this party on molly, no time for monologue
She say I'm Kevin Hart funny, so she gon' ride along
She say she came in with endurance, so she gon' do me all night long (Take it off)
We could dance in the moonlight, oh
She got a man, I told him, "Come to the moonlight brawl"
Don't stand a chance, don't stand a chance in the moonlight, oh
We throw them hands, we throw them hands in the moonlight, oh
You might also like
I'm in love with the moonlight, ah
Make love in the moonlight, oh
I've been myself since birth, nigga
Ain't nothin' like y'all
I'm in love with the moonlight
Make love in the moonlight, oh
I've been myself since birth, nigga
Ain't nothin' like y'all, y’all, y'all

Girl, you know I'm far from perfect, I won't lead you on
But tonight is feelin' perfect, this your favorite song
I know that mood right
I know that mood right, oh
Dance in the moonlight (I'm cuttin' too deep, I'm feelin' like a surgeon)
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh

Girl, you know I'm far from perfect, but I'm really worth it
She say that I'm pretty, I'm prettier in person
I'm drivin' her crazy, you know I'm really swervin'
I'm cuttin' too deep, I'm feelin' like a surgeon
Girl, you know I'm far from perfect, I won't lead you on
But tonight is feelin' perfect, this your favorite song
I know that mood right
I know that mood right, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh
Dance in the moonlight, oh, oh, oh, oh (Like a surgeon)
Dance in the moonlight, oh

Chance, don't stand a chance
In the moonlight, no
We throw them hands, we throw them hands
In the moonlight, no, oh57Embed
