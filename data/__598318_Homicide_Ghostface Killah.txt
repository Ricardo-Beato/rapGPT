17 ContributorsHomicide Lyrics
This nigga Tony think he back? Fuck that, I'ma fold niggas
Make a mothafuckin' example out him, I'ma show niggas
Around the way I done told them niggas
Fuck the OGs, we got the same type of guns as them older niggas
I know he killed the dawg so I'm holdin' grudge
It's a homi' on any and everybody that he love
Hold up, there go his man Mick
In the car with his kids, I'ma split his mothafuckin' wig
Follow him to the crib and park up the block
Go in the trunk, grab my mothafuckin' 40 Glock
On my way thinkin' this nigga gotta get it
I'ma empty out the clip so that Tony gets the message
Kick in the door, started lettin' off
Mick fell through the table, got wrapped up in the tablecloth
Skated off in the darkness of night
Left my callin' card on the body and said "fuck your life"

Shit is brutal, I gotta get made then bounce
36 seasons, I'm stuck back on the couch
Like a potato, I don't play though
I'm stone cold son, these lames is built like Play-Doh
I seen Mick's body on the floor covered in sheets
And a note that says I'm a dead man walkin'
An empty soul just headed for the coffin
This is crazy, they took my brother, they must be clueless
I'ma get that mothafucka, I'm ruthless
Relentless,  than a dusted out Navy Seal
I'ma skin him alive, that's for real
I ain't goin' nowhere, they let the beast out the cage
The face of a killer, straight up, on a rampage
War path, blood bath, a killing spree
I'ma show these mothafuckas how it's meant to be

Ayo go against the grain, I smell a massacre
I'll stick a bomb in your limo, blow up your passengers
Kill every one of 'em, leave no witnesses
Time for revenge, now live out your sentences
Ayo go against the grain, I smell a massacre
I'll stick a bomb in your limo, blow up your passengers
Kill every one of 'em, leave no witnesses
Time for revenge, now live out your sentences

I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere
Y'all mothafuckas comin' for my head?
This is Tony Starks, you can't stop me, mothafucka
Nigga I wipe my dick on your spaghetti fork, nigga
I'm gettin' this money, nigga, for life, nigga, forever
And I ain't talkin' 'bout shoebox money neither, niggaEmbed
