Three exotic broads and I got 'em soakin' panties
Told 'em they were certified, welcome to the Xanny family
Woah, woah
Hndrxx, say sumn, real spitta
Yeah, yeah

Three exotic broads and I got 'em soakin' panties
Told 'em they were certified, welcome to the Xanny family
Woah, woah (Welcome to the family, baby)
Woah, woah (Pop one, c'mon)
Three exotic broads (Yeah) and I got 'em soakin' panties
Told 'em they were certified, welcome to the Xanny family
Woah, woah (Certified)
Woah, woah (Certified, certified, certified)

Three exotic broads (Woah) and I got 'em actin' jiggy (Woah)
Got 'em suckin', takin' bars (Woah), now they screamin' "Team litty"
Woah, woah
Woah, woah (Team litty)
I'm just tryna slide on lil' shawty, hit the side door (Side)
You get penalized, you come around, It ain't enough dough (Nah)
Keep a bag of Xannies (Woah) if you tryna join the family (Family)
Got the sauce on me (Sauce) and it's Off-White, tanny (Tanny)
Puerto Rican freakin', oh, she sneakin', I done ordered up
She was goin' in inside the spur like a party bus
Pardon me, before I take a greed I never brag or boast (Never brag)
She don't speak no inglo, but I know she like to toot that coke
