9 ContributorsThey Donâ€™t Wanna Fuck Wit Me Lyrics
Damn
Timbaland, we 'bout to lace 'em one more time
Uh-huh, say what?
Damn
Timbaland, yeah
We 'bout to lace 'em one more time
Yeah, ooh

The M-I to the S-S
They put that on my chest
My car's the way that I flex
And people say I'm dope as fuck
They say I'm just too fly
I make 'em wanna get high
They want a piece of this pie
But I'm just too damn chill for them
No way you flip my shit
It feels like a good hit
And even if you bite
Nigga, you can't get
Smoke a little of this hay
Nigga, what you got to say?
Bizza-ba-za-blahzay
Bizza-ba-za-blahzay

We ridin' through your hood (Hood)
With the top down (Down)
In a SLK (What?)
Clean 348, what now? (Uh)
Two bad niggas
From the big VA (Bay, ayy)
Twelve blunts a day (What?)
Chillin' on the other side of the bay (Bay)
Who y'all think y'all is (Is)
Tryin' to get with the Mis'? (Mis')
You tryna diss
You think you can beat us, shit (Shit)
We them ill Wonder Twins
She's in a Benz
We them ill creators, yes

I come back into my flow
And people just don't know
They hate the way that I hee
They hate the way that I hee-haw
'Cause I got too much dough
You know my steelo
So what you come here for?
See, you don't wanna fuck with me
Get it off your chest
You know who's the best
See, there's no other yet
That can get down like Missy
So hit you off like this
And you be the witness
That I'm sure gifted
Nigga what, nigga what, nigga what
Nigga what, a-ha
Hey, yo Timbaland
Yo, I'ma just (Oh)
Dance a little bit
You don't mind if I get my boogie on, do you?
Haha, yeah, know what I'm sayin'?
We don't gotta rhyme through the whole track
The track is bangin' by itself
Know what I'm sayin'? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't want (Yeah)
To fuck with me (They don't want, they don't want, they don't want)
They don't want (They don't want)
Ooh, ooh, to fuck with me (Wanna fuck with me)
They don't want, they don't want
Oh, oh, oh, to fuck with me
No, they don't, they don't wanna

No, no, no
To fuck with me
Alright, we gonna be out...1Embed
