8 ContributorsJunkyard Lyrics
Check it out y'all
Pull the pin
Count to five
Top to bottom tonight
Borough watch, Jux war(?)
Savage, overkill
Definitive, red carpet
Cupcakes, iced right now
On time

Same hand that snuggled the barbed wire
Tug an orphan assortment of bell and three-alarm fire
Beautiful loser maneuver the goofy cubicle future alert
Big brother super-community burn
OK shoppers, tickets won't last
For the straight-to-video "Dog-Boy eats glass"
Who BMX match rotate on guerilla Babylon
Darwin on a peg taking his innervate to tag along
Ape escape gravitron, surly with two caps
One over the mask while plugging the flak back(?)
And it was, home depot for the five finger lazy lift
Ironically the same five measure the spray radius
Spray gradient, baiting for city tetris
Double-breasted hecklers bark at picket fences
Now mobile rogues develop a special network
Which further upsets the rich 'til rubberneckers double-check us
(Zero)
Tonight the scum dance and I got all my money on the one with the lung cramps
Little rat in the maze, they score him on his escape
Sorta likes the attention so he says check-in and stays
Answer: how do we record a documentarian suffering
While ushering the public's hands in
Or transfer greedy bruiser to user-friendly stanzas?
I guess it's like a junkwad full of dondy's candice
Product, Noun: a tampered-with, contaminated shrink-wrapped variant of the process, wow
As written by the messenger pigeons of Hell's Kitchen
Thank you for the dollar, hope you dig it
You might also like
Clap once for the junkyard punks
Good, clap twice for the junkyard knights
Good, pay attention 'cause part three of the lesson
Can fiddle with your direction, clap at every sentence
Heroes are never forgotten, legends never die
This is what I sound like alive

Two milligrams later, hits the stage
With Big Wiz on the fader, gravy aviators
Tipped low on the nose, 'til we ogle over the frame
With a pine-box channel pioneer eye aim
Miyazaki makeover the BK sky
So when the jungle hits the city, every insect is alive
Poison for the town square up out a stinger needle
If I sound scared, it's 'cause I pay rent with the little people
Dumb it down for none but none dumber
The dumb-out posse is off broadway for the summer, bummer
And stiller's in her loch ness, clocked fresh and official
The missiles rock bells, no bells or whistles
Shell-shocked with a flock of hell's wolves and minstrels
Shell-toed ghosts on nostalgia signals
Grassroots ghouls always kept it simple
Pour the water in the dirt then observe the impulse
Dixie cup telephoner, enemy port door(?)
And port wars Zooka wouldn't abort for
The swarms formula, please hit snooze
Keep a civil tongue in your teeth
You will need it to lick wounds
And he wrote his own laws with the claws of cougars
So the fire in the sky sorta steers the stupor to loop drums
Dummy, never off-base
With a resume of b-boyisms and paused tapes
Clap once for the junkyard punks
Good, clap twice for the junkyard knights
Good, pay attention 'cause part three of the lesson
Can fiddle with your direction, clap at every sentence
Heroes are never forgotten, legends never die
This is what I sound like aliveEmbed
