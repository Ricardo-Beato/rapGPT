Aye Offset (yo), aye Takeoff, what's up, unk?
You remember that shit we did way way way back in the day?
(I remember that) Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
We was some crazy young niggas huh?

I'd like to welcome you to Yung Rich Nation
I know you been patiently waiting
Yung Rich Nation that's the album
Tryna turn the mansion to a castle

Diamond shine came from Africa, shine, shine (Africa)
(Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors) Ooh, damn, bachelor
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
(If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ya, pitiful) Sad to say

First check bought a Audi Coupe
It was black and grey like the Raiders
First check bought a Challenger
It was 10 bands so I paid it
Remember the time, Offset he got me high
That was right by the neighbors house?
Remember the time we broke in the neighbors house
That was our first paper route
Remember the time they shot up my mama house
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time you niggas laughed at me
Said that I wouldn't bond out
You say that you trappin', take you to the bando
Hand you a fork, see what you bout
Before we made the song Hit Em' wit it
We was knockin' niggas out
Before we made the song 'Birds', pelicans fly to the south
Niggas talkin' stupid up in crowd
Jumped in the crowd and punched em' in the mouth
First time we in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock, and we beat the trap out
Don't come in my trap if you unannounced (Pussy)
You might also like
Diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors (Ooh, dab, bachelor)
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ch'ya (pitiful, sad to say)

Remember the time, I did my first break and enter?
Me, myself & I ain't had nobody wit me
Cause I ain't want my uncles know I did it
Remember the time I got kicked out for havin' gas stashed in my locker?
In the gym choppin' it up wit my partners
Next thing you know got walked out by the coppers
First juug I hit at school, Lord please forgive me
I know you remember that
6 period plotted on my teacher had to hit for that fundraiser fanny pack
Got home and counted the check
I'm thinkin' to myself Takeoff what you gon' do wit that
Call the plug up ask him where he at
I'm celebratin' smokin' back to back
Remember that time Quavo came home with a full grown marijuana plant
Stinkin' up the crib tryin' dry it off in the oven it was still wet
Mama came in smelt the odor said "Damn boy I can catch contact"
I got that dope talkin' anthrax, hit a fat one when we hit for fifty racks

Diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors (Ooh, dab, bachelor)
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ch'ya (pitiful, sad to say)8Embed
