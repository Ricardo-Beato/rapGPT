Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire (Put yuh light inna di air)
Mo' fire, give 'em
Mo' fire

I Diddy Bop, my fifty cocked
My city hot, I'm dodging the city cop
I play 'em like Pitty Pat, yeah, I'm kicking back, yeah
I'm getting stacks, these bitches is really rats
I fuck 'em and give 'em back, yeah, I really mack, yeah
How real is that? You love 'em, you really wack
I hustle and bend my back, my muscle is intact
My biceps and triceps is ah, yes

Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire (Put yuh light inna di air)
Mo' fire, I give 'em
Mo' fire

I'm coming through in something new
The color is Smurf blue, I'm puffin' that purple
Believe it, if I talk it, I walk it like Herschel
I get it like it is on a commercial, first too
This is verse two, it is worse too
I'll murk you like I birthed you
You niggas small bubbles (Baby), I'll burp you (Hey, hey)
And spit you out and have your girlfriend slurp you
My jewelry earth blue, some say it's earth green
I'm like whatever, my shit mean and obscene
Now, I've been seen on a lot of different scenes
That mean I got a lot of different cream
You might also like
Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire (Put yuh light inna di air)
Mo' fire, I give 'em
Mo' fire

I raise more fire to the man up higher
I lick a shot to let him know that I'm a rider
My dreads hang to let him know that I'm a lion
Represent the jungle when the others just tryin'
I represent my mother like, "Baby, stop cryin'"
I know my papa gone, but guarantee he see us shinin', yeah
Now you are looking at New Orleans' finest
Now you are bein' blinded by European diamond
And you are seein' two or three times and
Got your vision all fucked up, now you can't even find me
And I ain't even hidin', naw, I'm right here, baby (Right here, baby)
She wanna walk and shit, I'm like, "Yeah, baby" (Yeah, baby)
Battyman get the shotty to his head
Rockabye his ass to sleep, rock it, lay him down to bed
I'll put you in my pocket right next to the condoms, homie
You ain't nothin' but a profit

Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire (Put yuh light inna di air)
Mo' fire, I give 'em
Mo' fire, yeah
Mo' fire
Mo' fire, Weezy
Mo' fire
Mo' fire, give 'em
