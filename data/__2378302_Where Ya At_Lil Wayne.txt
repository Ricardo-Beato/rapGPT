40 ContributorsWhere Ya At Lyrics
No Ceilings

Hey now, you're an all-star
But the bitches you be with, they are sub-par
But the bitches you be with, they be cock-blockin'
Hope you put the kids to sleep, baby cock-blockin'
You could really get this meat, get this hot sausage
And I'm way too rich to beef, I just buy a body
And I really kick my feet up, and that's not karate
Yeah, I really kick my feet up, let a thot massage 'em, yeah

Where ya ass was at when I was with the Hot Boys?
Probably watchin' Baller Blockin', eatin' popcorn, yeah
Where ya ass was at? You was in the drought, boy
I was probably at the fight bringin' out Floyd

Said she love me 'cause I'm laid back, she outgoin'
Opposites attract, pockets fat, like Samoan
I just told my goons I got it, I just waved 'em off
I just told Tunechi, "I got it" and he said, "Of course"
Lose my mind, the only time I'd ever take a loss
I work too hard for taking off, rrt, I'm taking off
Really 'bout to see a billion, I'm in arm's reach
Sleep on a hammock in the middle of two palm trees
My neighbors can't sleep, all they hearin' is them cars screech
My bitch can't sleep, all she hearin' is them car keys
I'm just sipped out and I'm way too tired to talk, please
I'm just sipped out and I'm way too tired, I'm yawning
Yeah
You might also like
Where ya ass was at when I was fifteen in a Porsche?
Where ya ass be at when we be poppin' all these corks?
Where ya ass be at? Know you're prolly with them dorks
I'm prolly with some bitches that be poppin' pills and snort

Diamonds in my mouth, no Swarovski
I'm hittin' notes with the pistol, ooh, I'm off-key
And the money coming godspeed
I'm movin' slow, Lisa Turtle, Lark Voorhies
Found the treasure chest, inside was a heartbeat
And Katrina had us hustlin' out a RV
We had to stash and still balled, Steve Harvey
We had to stash and still balled, Steve Harvey
And we set a nigga up like eHarmony
And your bitch plain, nigga, and your car cheap
And we leave your brain right there on your broad cheek
And we leave some stains right there on your offspring
And the purple rain right here in the soft drink
Yeah, the purple rain right here in the soft drink
And to fight the pain, nigga, like a horse tranq
And we don't complain, nigga, and we don't blink

And he dumb as hell, and I swear his ass don't think
I think he run with 12 and I think his whole squad linked
I be so underwhelmed, 'cause I swear his whole style weak
I'm moving slow as hell but the money coming godspeed
I'm moving slow as hell but the money coming godspeed
I just told a pussy nigga, "Call your henchmen, nigga"
I just stole on a nigga mid-sentence, nigga
Fiend searching in a haystack for syringes, nigga
Dopeman, got 'em flipping like some ninjas, nigga
Got 'em tweaking, got 'em lurking, got 'em cringing, nigga
Ooh, that's them symptoms, nigga, I can't prevent 'em, nigga
Split a nigga head in two, that's split decision, nigga
Been to Hell and back, came back in mint condition, nigga
Feel like Heaven when them racks return to spender, nigga
Feel like Heaven's only lacking your attendance, nigga
Feel like stunting, drop the tops and not them windows, nigga
Toss out your demo, I ain't even like your intro, nigga
I just went Kimbo with this tempo, un momento, nigga
You know my MO, nigga, pit that A-M-M-O, nigga
Blat

I ask my ceilings, "Where ya ass was at?"
To all my Ceilings fans, I'm back
They pushed the album back, fuck25Embed
