You could fly
Nobody can touch you... nobody
You could fly
Nobody can touch you

Ain't-ain't-ain't no question, ain't no conspiracy, yeah
Kee-kee-keep on searching for love, who else is incomplete?
There's so many good vibes just floatin' around in the world
And when the ground and sky combine, oh yeah
I'm feeling more than fine
I'm so Rock and Rollie

Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel it?
You-you-you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it? (Hmm, nah, no, nah, no)

You-you-you know that I'm unfuckwittable

One-one-one day I knew no one could help me in Hell
Not-not-not many people are true, fake as the lies they tell, (Hmm, no, no, no)
The world is filled with good vibes, and that is what I seek
And now I'm feeling more than cool, oh yeah
I'm feeling more than cool, yeah
Them Jokers can't hold me
You might also like
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel it?
You-you-you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it? (Hmm, nah, no, nah, no)

(Yeah, what you know?, what you know?)
You-you-you know that I'm unfuckwittable

Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel it?
You-you-you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it? (Hmm, nah, no, nah, no)

(Woh, hoh, know, you know)
You-you-you know that I'm unfuckwittable
