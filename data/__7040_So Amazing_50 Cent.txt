20 ContributorsSo Amazing Lyrics
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
I'll be around to catch your call
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And I adore you
You always brighten up my day
I'll never ever let you wait
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And you're amazing (so amazing)

I'm from, city to city, to show to show
See me I been grinding across the globe
I hustle hard to get the grip fa'sho
So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
Tell me, what's on your mind when you alone
I have you touching on ya self, girl all in the zone
Now if I turned you on
With things I say, would I be wrong?
Then I don't wanna be right
Matter of fact, I'd be on the next flight
Trying to get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piping hot
While the wind blow through ya hair in the drop
Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex
And let me do what I do until you climax
You can go straight to sleep after it's all over
In the morning, roll over and we can start over
You might also like
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
I'll be around to catch your call
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And I adore you
You always brighten up my day
I'll never ever let you wait
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And you're amazing (so amazing)

Yeah, I called just to say
"Hope you're having a nice day"
You're special, I'd get into you
Oops, I mean I'm into you
Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you
Jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie
Better yet, to watch you climb into the Jacuzzi
Yeah, bubbles in the bath, Dom in the glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
It's fun, but before long, a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash
To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots, I like Jeeps and Coupes
So I grind all the time to save me some loot
I put a spell on ya, I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom working it well, I don't kiss and tell
But I don't care if you kiss and tell
You can tell ya girlfriend the details
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
I'll be around to catch your call
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And I adore you
You always brighten up my day
I'll never ever let you wait
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And you're amazing (so amazing)
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
I'll be around to catch your call
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And I adore you
You always brighten up my day
I'll never ever let you wait
'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And you're amazing (so amazing)4Embed
