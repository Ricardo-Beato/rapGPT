12 ContributorsUpper Echelon Lyrics
I take the long way home, I took her the sneaky route
I'm doin' eighty on the back streets, you know what I'm 'bout
We upper echelon, aye, yup
If it ain't that loud, loud pack, no thanks
If you ain't pourin' up Actavis, up then I don't wanna drink
We upper echelon, aye, yup

I'm in the super Charger, these fools super fraud
I'm goin' extra hard, then private jet the squad
I go to (?), I I'm feelin' like god
Shout out to Lotto Gang, I feel like a lotto ticket
I spit a ball of flame, I'm up in the Hall of Fame
My tango razor tame, I feed my killas cocaine
I like my music geeked up, hop on this money train
I'm higher than a plane, this shit ain't 'bout to change
I'm flyer than a plane, shit, I'm a rocket launcher
Chickens in the bumper, that's a chicken coupe
Oh, just do the raps for me, you know I do for you
We upper echelon, we gotta be careful how we move

I take the long way home, I took her the sneaky route
I'm doin' eighty on the back streets, you know what I'm 'bout
We upper echelon, aye, yup
If it ain't that loud, loud pack, no thanks
If you ain't pourin' up Actavis, up then I don't wanna drink
We upper echelon, aye, yup

Aye Yung Pluto Yung Pluto Yung Pluto
Yeah that's what she call me
I ain't fuckin' with ya swag shawty
Unless you think you all that
Lil Mexico nigga
I'm on that Keyshia Cole and all that
My swagger to the maximum
I'm runnin' through them tall racks
Over 60 I'm on me, and you know we callin'
Them loud racks
I'm in true religion in true religion
Nigga we bought that
When you up you up you play big
I'm a Freebandz nigga trust that
I'm drinkin' on that lean by the gallon
We ain't save the lean no mo'
Geeked up off this money
I don't even pop no bean no mo'
Got a different designer on me
I don't even wanna match no mo'
Fast money fast cars, I don't never go slow
Free my nigga Ty, Imma real black amigo

I take the long way home, I took her the sneaky route
I'm doin' eighty on the back streets, you know what I'm 'bout
We upper echelon, aye, yup
If it ain't that loud, loud pack, no thanks
If you ain't pourin' up Activis, up then I don't wanna drink
We upper echelon, aye, yup
Bigger than skyscrapers, I'm my own planet
Future Chris Angel
I can make the work vanish
I ain't gone rap
Long as we got a understanding
I know the trap of the US Map
All the way to Japan again
Money ain't a issue took the Freebandz and
Expanded
My team we in this spazzin'
From the gutter to the mansion
We play by the same rules
Don't nothin' change but ya address
Extravagant nigga
So when I move I move sporadic
Got money living lavish
In a world full of madness
I go hard as I can go
Until I'm living in the palace
It's a swerve I should take
When them cameras start flashing
Trash bags full of cash in those coupes
When ya dashing

I take the long way home, I took her the sneaky route
I'm doin' eighty on the back street, you know what I'm 'bout
We upper echelon, aye, yup
If it ain't that loud, loud pack, no thanks
If you ain't pourin' up Actavis, up then I don't wanna drink
We upper echelon, aye, yup3Embed
