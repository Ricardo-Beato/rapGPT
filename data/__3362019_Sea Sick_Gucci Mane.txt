27 ContributorsSea Sick Lyrics
Southside on the track, yeaaaa

Wipe the plug nose, call me Kleenex
Finessed him with the load, he drunk he sea sick
Bust down my Hublot, I'm drunk I'm sea sick
Lil thot bitch that hurled, fucked up my V-neck
Wipe the plug nose, they call me Kleenex
Finessed him that load, he drunk he sea sick
Just bust down my Hublot, I'm drunk I'm sea sick
Lil thot bitch just hurled, fucked up my V-neck

I step on what's stepped on, we mix the remix
What a sweet lick I let them build up, double back that's a rekick
I'm rocking solitaires all 18 no need to preset
I'm talking big stones with my Flintstone and I make it look easy
I'm Gucci Mane the jeweler, VVV my pieces
Big rose gold Frank Muller, my watch conceited
I gave her a few dollars, she fine she need it
But don't call back, hoe fall back, bitch don't be greedy
Just gave away some turkeys, I feed the needy
I'm rich but I'm hood, can't fuck with they need me
Just bust down a duo, they drunk they sleazy
Good suck up got fucked up, they sleep we leaving
You might also like
Wipe the plug nose, call me Kleenex
Finessed him the load, he drunk he sea sick
Bust down my Hublot, I'm drunk I'm sea sick
Lil thot bitch done hurled, fucked up my V-neck

Wiped the plug nose, gesundheit
If it's on sight then I'm green lighting
If there's gun fighting then there's no typing
Homicide bodies, little kids cryin'
Bodies flying, they duckin', what the hell is they shootin'
Paradise is like Vietnam, what the hell is we doing
Sun Valley like Lebanon, Famgoon lil Pakistan
If a nigga wants the point of  and give the drummer some
I'm on a marijuanathon, I'm on a marijuan-on-one
Who want smoke I wanna sell you some
Track the trail another metric ton
Grade A it's excellent, honor roll no cap and gown
I'm with Gucci gang but I ain't Lil Pump
This ain't a lil pump this a big drum
Didn't join the band I never went to prom
East Atlanta slum wop I'm one-of-one
I'm with Southside, he run the mafia
You hear the 808s them the crazy guns
Wipe the plug nose, call me Kleenex
Finessed him with the load, he drunk he sea sick
Bust down my Hublot, I'm drunk I'm sea sick
Lil thot bitch just hurled, fucked up my V-neck
Wipe the plug nose, they call me Kleenex
Finessed him with that load, he drunk he sea sick
Just bust down my Hublot, I'm drunk I'm sea sick
Lil thot bitch just hurled, fucked up my V-neck1Embed
