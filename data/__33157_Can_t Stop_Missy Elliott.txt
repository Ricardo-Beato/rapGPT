5 ContributorsCan’t Stop Lyrics

Rich Nice
Woo! C'mon!
Sick! Uh-huh!
Yes! Woo! Holla

I be thinkin' 'bout that big – Oh!
The way you used to rock it to me nice and slow (C'mon)
You used to do it 'til my back felt broke (Uh)
You used to say, "Give it to me," I'd say "No" (Woo)
You used to talk that kinky shit up in my ears (Mhm-hmm)
And you would buy me pink pretty underwears (Mhm-hmm)
And I would moan 'cause you would make me feel nice (C'mon)
And you would make me feel like makin' love twice (C'mon)
What I'm sayin': You the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough (Uh-huh)
Hey, shorty, I can't get enough (Okay)
Can't stop, won't stop, call me Puff (Uh-huh)
Hold me down to the ground, pick me up (Uhh)
Now move it 'round, break it down, hold up (Uh-huh)
Scream loud, Black and proud, let's fuck (C'mon)
Nine to five, do it live, sho 'nough (Woo!)
I be thinkin' 'bout the way you do it good (Ugh)
I like it 'cause you raised in the hood (Uhh)
And put your back into it (Uhh)
I tell you "No," change my mind, then I do it (C'mon)
You cute, you fine, you fire (Ooh!)
I'm the boss, do the job, you hired (Ooh!)
Heather Hunter must've got me inspired (Uh-huh)
To work for hours, fall asleep, get you tired 'cause (C'mon!)
You might also like
I can't stop thinking 'bout you (Woo!)
Or the way you do what you do (Uh-huh)
With you I can not lose
I put it down like some brand new shoes (C'mon!)
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you (Uh-huh)
The way you do what you do (Woo!)
With you I can not lose
Now let me put it down (C'mon!)

I be thinkin' 'bout the way you do it good (Woo!)
I-I, I, I be thinkin' 'bout the way you do it good (Yes!)
I-I (Ehh), I-I-I-I be think-think-think-thinkin' (Fire) 'bout-bout-bout-bout
The way-way-way (Uh!), way, way-way-way you do-do, do-do-do it goo-good

He wan' take me to a hotel (Woo!)
See if it's good, if the nookie smell (Hoo)
When I put it down he like, "Oh, yeah!"
Taste like apples and a bag of pears (Hahh?)
Right here, right there, everywhere
To the bed, to the kitchen, in the wooden chair
He like to hear me moan like, "Mhmmm"
Boy's in his zone and I don't care (Hoo)
Sittin' on his lap, pullin' on my track
He piggidy-piggidy-piggidy-piggy my back (Hahh!)
In fact no slack, damn, he the mack
He ain't got to work me like that (Hoh-hoh, hoh-hoh, c'mon!)
I can't stop thinking 'bout you (Woo!)
Or the way you do what you do (Uh-huh)
With you I can not lose
I put it down like some brand new shoes (Uhh, c'mon!)
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you (Uh-huh)
The way you do what you do (Uh-uh, woo!)
With you I can not lose
Now let me put it down, put it down

I'm the boss, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm the boss
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm, I'm the boss, do the job, you hired
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm, I'm the boss
I'm-I'm-I'm the bo-boss, do-do the job-job, you-you hired

What I'm sayin': You the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough (Uh-huh)
Hey, shorty, I can't get enough (Okay)
Can't stop, won't stop, call me Puff (Uh-huh)
Hold me down to the ground, pick me up (Uhh)
Now move it 'round, break it down, hold up (Uh-huh)
Scream loud, black and proud, let's fuck (C'mon)
Nine to five, do it live, sho 'noughEmbed
