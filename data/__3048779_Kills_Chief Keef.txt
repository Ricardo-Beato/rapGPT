Let's get it

I sell, I ship (Bitch), I bag, I seal (Dope)
I swag, that Gucci (Bitch), that Louis, for real (Gucci, Louis)
Big knots in my Balmains, it is (True, true)
The thing under this Louis, it kills (Beep, beep, beep)
I sell (That dope)
I bag, I seal, I swag (That Gucci)
The Louis, for real (Catch up), big knots (I got in my)
Balmains, it is the thing (That's up under)
This Louis, it kills, bang (Sosa baby)

So high up off this dope (Huh?), I need a parachute (Dope)
I'm in this Bentley coupe (What else?), it's filled with residue (Huh?)
I got my dawgs with me (Grr) and now I let them loose
Tell the cops lies (Yeah), 'cause I can't tell the truth (Nah)
I'm rocking Louis sandals (Bitch), my son got on Louis pampers (Gucci, Gucci, Gucci)
So many Gucci sandals, my house smell like Gucci candles (True, true, true)
Smoking thoinky oinky, you know I got that thoinky on me (Bang)
Smoking thoinky oinky, you know I got that thoinky on me (Sosa baby, bang)

In a sportscar, racing to the racks (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Keep on hating on me, you not doing that bad (Nah)
