8 Contributors220 Lyrics
220 get dressed up, jumped on a boat
Fuck with my locs
Breakin' the bread

220 on the boat, here's a toast to my folks
It's a holiday, Crip, I'ma fuck with my locs
Get dressed, so fresh, big S on my chest
Now I'm finna work, yellow Steeler shirt
501's with the Stacy Adams tips
Picture a room full of Long Beach 20 Crips
Doin' this, who in this? You in this? We in this bitch
Wish the dead homeboys was seein' this shit
Neither, none, best 20 minutes or less
It's a C-Walk contest, who do it the best?
Right your set with the feet, skip along to the beat
Represent your shit and bang out your street
For real though, king of the hill though
Run up on a nigga, you get popped like a pill yo
See I'm a dub motherfucker, and all y'all know
So if you're with it, let's get it 432-O, come on

(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'

I got my 'do dirt' locs on, you better leave them gloves alone
Popped up on them blocks, 
15s rumblin', carvin' up the concrete
I go back like G-Man and SA double G, yeah
Doggie Dogg scooped a nigga up a long time ago
And said, "We gotta do this for the big 2-O", you know
Let's slap some dominos, and crack some bitches, cuz
Catch me yellin' out (what?) Trick, I been the dub
This a hood day, nigga what a good day
Where them homies , hit him and tell him let's parlae
Never outta  with  I keep the line open
Meditatin', contemplatin' the way we grind on em'
Big beefin' always told me always keep my crippin' tight
This one goes out to goats, cuh, 20 crip for life
Never ever will I switch up
My colors black and gold, all the homies throw your dubs up

(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
I'm shootin' like I just started
But I'ma walk up in this motherfucker cold-hearted
I know you niggas don't see me as much as you'd like
'Cause I'm out gettin' money when I'm rockin' the mic
I'm a long way from Locus Ave, my locas have
Been there with me through the good and bad
Know look, let me reminisce, and twist a fuckin' blunt to spark
I got put on, '84 at King Park
Shottin' hoops with Charlie Mo and 
With the bumblebees, real east-side G's
Then go to  and ball out for any black ass
And wait for all the bitches at Poly to get outta class
I'm poppin' at 'em from a distant, but I'm persistent
That's some 20 crip shit
See I'm a dub motherfucker and all y'all know
So if you're with it, let's get it 432-O, come on

(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
(Me and my, me and my niggas)
(Me and my, me and my, me and my niggas) We rollin'
