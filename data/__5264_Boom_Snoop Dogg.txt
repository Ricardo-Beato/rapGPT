Boom!
Boom!
Yeah, top Dogg
Boom!
Haha, uh

Get your money, whip your hair
Executive branch, blowin' smoke like a player
Yeah, in the club, yes, it cracks
Cute little mama, but they stacked with backs
I’m smoking grape, purple urple
You in doggie world, come and join my circle
I break down herbal 'til I move like a turtle
My money is green, and my Porsche is turbo
In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop
Baby's a lawyer, her body's the truth (Cute)
I’m in the game for real, it pays to chill
I walk in the club, and they front the bill
I’m the big dog, best beware
You coming with me, if you stop and stare
She'll be on my team, in my car
On the way to the spot, yes you are
Toasting up, hosting us
And when we done, we west coasting love
For shendo, blowing endo
How much for the dog in the window?
You might also like
Oh
Wh-what, wh-what?
Boom!
Boom!
Say what? Say what?
Boom!
Talk to 'em, T-pain

Baby I’m a dog! (I’m a dog!) Beware! (Beware!)
I’ll do whatever, however I want! (I want!)
This one for y'all! (This one for y'all!) Oh yeah! (Oh yeah!)
Now put your hands in the air (Now), whip your hair and go
La, la la la
Boom shakalaka when it drop, oh I'mma have her saying
La, la la la
One hitter quitter, shawty know the damn thing
Boom!

I'm all about the money, the money I got
On the V.I.P. tip, Maserati's in the lot
Chilling with the stars, where the bottles never stop
Got a model on my lap, baby show me what you got
With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy
Girls who like girls, wanna do it to daddy
Real talk, tha suites is next
One more drink gonna lead to sex
These girls is bad, the floor is packed
They shut the door down when it reach the max
Whatchu tryna drink? Clear or yak?
She got a apple-bottom homie, all I do is mack
I does it well, your game is wack
I gets to the business, no chit-chat
Now where do we go? I beats the gush
She in love with the gangster, that's whassup
That's whassup!
Boom!
That's whassup!
Boom!
That's whassup!
Boom!
Spit to 'em, T-Pain

Baby I’m a dog! (I’m a dog!) Beware! (Beware!)
I’ll do whatever, however I want! (I want!)
This one for y'all! (This one for y'all!) Oh yeah! (Oh yeah!)
Now put your hands in the air (Now), whip your hair and go
La, la la la
Boom shakalaka when it drop, oh I'mma have her saying
La, la la la
One hitter quitter, shawty know the damn thing
Boom!

Boom shakalaka, here comes the chief rocka
Smoke good with T-Pain, and Snoop the weed doctor
Big 808, now feel the base in your chakra
And watch me smoke like a shotta'
Coke bottle shape, light green eyes
Drunk off of love like a Colt 45
I keep kush in my lungs, I'mma smoke 'til I die
Just bust a bad one, for my homie D. Dimes
They do it for fortune, some for fame
I got five different strains, you ever taste Purple Rain?
Turn up the volume, adjust the game
Ain't a damn thing change, still a G-thang
Lil' mama whip your hair, exhale the chronic
As the smoke disappears, I'm ready to ball
Your girl on my team, and she ready to fall
And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg
Boom!
Say what? Say what?
Boom!
I don't think they heard you
Boom!
Talk to 'em, T-Pain

Baby I’m a dog! (I’m a dog!) Beware! (Beware!)
I’ll do whatever, however I want! (I want!)
This one for y'all! (This one for y'all!) Oh yeah! (Oh yeah!)
Now put your hands in the air (Now), whip your hair and go
La, la la la
Boom shakalaka when it drop, oh I'mma have her saying
La, la la la
One hitter quitter, shawty know the damn thing
Boom!Embed
