Sosa
O'Block, yeah, yeah
Bang, bang, bang bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang
Sosa, O'Block
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang

Let's get this shit jumping
Get these hoes bussin'
Niggas sneak dissin'
Well they ain't sayin' nothin'
Them bullets get the touchin'
Them veins get the bussin'
'Cause bullets come a dozen
Then they burn like the oven
I'm a sick mothafucka'
Loud be my robatussin'
And I can't keep count of these bitches I be fuckin'
I'll shoot a nigga down
Bitch, I'm kinda off
I grew up in this shit goin' by what I saw
Alotta real niggas, they was gettin' money
So now I'm on the block, nigga, rain, sleet, or sunny
OTF run it, I fucks wit' Young Money
I make one phone call, yeah, Cortez he comin'
Wit' the Young Money, Kush stankin' like onions
Edai, you been my nigga, introduced me to 600
D-Rose, what up? You scoring shit out here
Keep ya head up out here, every year is our year

Niggas ain't fuckin' with me, man
You don't want me to come through and make the scene very scary, baby

All my Wiic City O'Block niggas, man
All my Frontstreet, Glory Boyz, man, ya know

Bang, bang, bang, bang bang
