7 ContributorsTears of a Teenage Mother Lyrics
He's braggin' about his new Jordan's...
The baby just ran out of milk...
He's buyin' gold every two weeks!
The baby just ran out of Pampers!
He's buyin clothes for his new girl...
And the baby just ran out of medicine!
You ask for money for the baby?
The daddy just ran out the door...
GIRL! I can't believe him!
