"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?" (Uh)

Chilling with my team counting this fucking money
I stay with presidents like special agents, honey
You get it from the bank, I get it from the mint
Only new bills, call me The Fresh Prince
We gon' take over the whole world
Real all the time, RattPack so thorough
Used to rock sterling, now my shorty wearin' pearls
Fuck with grown women, no time for these little girls
I used to think about the things in which I never had
But now whenever I reflect it only makes me glad
I went from H.O.C. to chauffeurs in the H.O.V
By hustlin' tapes like they was ki's
So much paparazzi, catch an epileptic seiz'
I used to struggle with this shit, now I kill it with ease
Started nationwide, but now I'm tourin overseas
Life of a don, money blowing in the breeze

"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"Top five MC's, you gotta rewind"
"Life of a don, life of a don—don"
"It's what you all—It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?"
"I find (Logic) the dopest, flyest, O.G.-pimp-hustler-gangster-player-hardcore-motherfucker living today. To be honest, I am totally and completely on his dick"

They say time is money and I spend most of that with rhymin'
I eat filet mignon, reminisce when this was ramen
Yeah, yo chain shinin', but my aura is blindin'
I'm sick of U.S currency, I want millions in diamonds
Y'all roll blunts, we roll cubans
Sound of my city so soothin'
Check my method, man, bring the suits in, haters we leave 'em oozin'
Headed to the top, penthouse where we movin', ha
Bless the mic with my presence and then I teach ya
Listen carefully as I beseech ya
If I never meet ya, I hope my lyrics reach ya
Some like they ki's white, homie, I prefer Alicia (Sinatra)
