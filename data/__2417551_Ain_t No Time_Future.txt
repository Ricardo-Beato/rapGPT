58 ContributorsAinâ€™t No Time Lyrics
Super, yeah
Future, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah
Astronaut

Kicking flavors Saint Laurent watch how I walk (Watch how I walk)
Let this paper be the reason why we talk (Hey, hey)
Ain't no favors, they gon' outline you in chalk (Woah)
You the biggest, biggest hater of them all (Of them all)

It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no time (Ain't no time)
It ain't no time, it ain't no his, it ain't no mine (Ain't no mine)
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no lying (Hold on, hold on)
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no flying (Hey)

You dropping them dimes, you dropping them dimes, you dropping them dimes (Woah, woah)
You look like you lying, you look like you lying, you look like you lying (You look like you lying)
We do this Sunday to Sunday (Sunday)
Sun up to the sun down (Get it)
Look like I stepped on the runway
They try to tell me to calm down (Calm down)
Peep how I came in the game and I start rocking that Tom Ford
We don't what we be saying, we just be yelling out Bonjour
We don't what we be saying, we just be yelling out Bonjour
I like to play with them bands right before I do the encore
You might also like
I like to play with the cash, go to Laurent and spaz
I like to play with the cash, go to Chanel and spaz
I like to go to the jeweler, tell 'em to make me some glass
I like to play with the cash, go to Chanel and spaz

Kicking flavors Saint Laurent watch how I walk (Watch how I walk)
Let this paper be the reason why we talk (Hey, hey)
Ain't no favors, they gon' outline you in chalk (Woah)
You the biggest, biggest hater of them all (Of them all)

It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no time (Ain't no time)
It ain't no time, it ain't no his, it ain't no mine (Ain't no mine)
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no lying (Hold on, hold on)
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no flying (Hey)

You slangin' that iron, you slangin' that iron, you toting that iron
You pressin' the issue, you pushing the gas, you making 'em violate
I'm dropping the top on that foreign, I zig and I zag I'm all on the grass
I did what I had to pass, you niggas you better go back to your stash
I did what I had to do, I ran in that bitch I didn't have a mask
I did what I should have did, survive through the trenches and look like a man
I sit at the throne, I sit at the throne, you niggas ain't nothing but some clones
I sipping that Dom Perignon, when I'm at the store they ringing me up
My bitch on her bitch, got her eatin' it up
I done gained a little weight and I'm keeping it up
Steppin' in Christians I came out the mud
I'm flexing on purpose when I'm in the club
(Free bandz!)
Kicking flavors Saint Laurent watch how I walk (Watch how I walk)
Let this paper be the reason why we talk (Hey, hey)
Ain't no favors, they gon' outline you in chalk (Woah)
You the biggest, biggest hater of them all (Of them all)

It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no time (Ain't no time)
It ain't no time, it ain't no his, it ain't no mine (Ain't no mine)
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no lying (Hold on, hold on)
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no flying (Hey)

I like to play with the cash, go to Laurent and spaz
I like to play with the cash, go to Chanel and spaz
I like to go to the jeweler, tell 'em to make me some glass
I like to play with the cash, go to Chanel and spaz

It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no time
It ain't no time, it ain't no his, it ain't no mine
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no lying
It ain't no time, it ain't no time, it ain't no flying24Embed
