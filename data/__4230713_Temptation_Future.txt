47 ContributorsTemptation Lyrics
Freebandz
Yeah
I'm the richest nigga out my city if you ain't know
These hoes can hop on Spirit Airlines about it
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
I made it finessin', I turned into somethin' from nothin', yeah
Made it through poverty, I'm the minority, you know my story
Hop on the jet off my property, I fly away
Fly, fly, fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah

Copped me a presi', yeah, yeah
Straight out the trenches, yeah, yeah
My niggas came with me, yeah, yeah
The riches, the riches, the riches, yeah
Richest nigga out Zone 6, yeah
All of these hoes came with it, yeah
Audemars Piguets came with it, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was tryna fight temptation, yeah
Top gone, it's on vacation, yeah
I'm not tryin' to hurt nobody
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
Count up the hundreds, I promise some patience
Give you some game, that's slow motivation
We need the gas straight in the basement
Switch up the swag, switch up the bag
Niggas, they jockin' my swag 'cause it's fashion
I do it bigger than niggas imagined
Heard that bitch makin' up rumors
She gave more head than a tumor
And I got facts, I can prove it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got real rich and ain't get no diploma
She think it's somethin' got to do with my mama
Well I can't love her, like she need me
That's what you get when you thinkin' I'm average
Now I wake up and I fuck on a bad bitch
Drugs got me savage

It's so hard, it's so hard, these Perkys keep me sane
All my dawgs, all my dawgs, found 'em locked up in the cage
We gettin' paid, we so paid, move them bricks, then move on
Switch them bags, switch them bags, then move on, then move on

Copped me a presi', yeah, yeah
Straight out the trenches, yeah, yeah
My niggas came with me, yeah, yeah
The riches, the riches, the riches, yeah
Richest nigga out Zone 6, yeah
All of these hoes came with it, yeah
Audemars Piguets came with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I was tryna fight temptation, yeah
Top gone, it's on vacation, yeah
I'm not tryin' to hurt nobody
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Car full of bullets, ain't findin' no shooter
That's what you get when you niggas delusional
I remember when they thought I was average
Now I wake up and I fuck on a bad bitch

I tried to fight temptations, yeah
Riches on riches on riches on riches on riches...
And I can't lie, you... Future had the first bust down Richard Mille I had seen, by far
(Ayy what it do, ayy what it do)
The first one
(Ayy, what it do)7Embed
