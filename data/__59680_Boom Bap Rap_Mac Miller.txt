Hey
Big Jerm, cool beat that we made here, man
I played the keys, you play the drums, did a little bass on this one
Uh
Hey
(Ha) Alright, alright, alright, alright
'92 'til infinity and beyond

You witnessin' ya gambles of infinity
Music in my soul, on the go, ain't gettin' rid of me
Peace and divinity in each and every inch of me
We livin' through this melody, you singin' in a different key
See, I'm nice with these rhymes, I might be blind
Just see inside of minds, I gets unkind
I'm like a psychic; I don't give a fuck if you like this
We here to party, had a little music to turn up loud
Uh, '92 'til infinity just some shit that you ain't heard in a while
I don't give a fuck if there ain't a party
We got a little music to turn up loud
We different, got our life that we livin', standin' out in the crowd

That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it, I'ma tell 'em I'm just cool like that
Alright, alright, alright, alright, that boom bap rap
When they ask you what you doin'
Tell 'em that you cool and keepin' it movin'
Ain't nothin' new, I'ma do what I do

Yo
Pullin' up in somethin' that you haven't seen
Clean and accompanied by one of the baddest queens
Peel the top back, feelin' superb as I pass the green
We just cool and vibin' without the magazine
Breezin' through 376 thinkin' 'bout my past ventures
Came from runnin', duckin' and jumpin' over fences
Used to play reckless tryna get the check 
Now it's visions with my camp from the triple deck yacht
I can't stop, won't stop, I keep runnin'
Unleash the beast, freak beats and keep comin'
Nasty but we spit it so sincerely
Drip phlegm from the pen so they can feel me
Boom bap ones with the hip-hop
They say we different, wonder how we do it, but it's sealed in a ziplock
Killin' beats from '87 'til the end of me
And Mac been involved since '92 until infinity

That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it, I tell 'em I'm just cool like that
Alright, alright, alright, alright, that boom bap rap
When they ask you what you doin'
Tell 'em that you cool and keepin' it movin'
Ain't nothin' new, I'ma do what I do
This that boom bap shit, return of mister boom bapstic
Most Dope makin' new classics
Screem beef dog, look, lose that shit
You ain't built for contact, better do glasses
Haters get mad, my view zoom past 'em
You lose that, bitch, you think local, I do atlas
Vinny Radio do that shit
It's like bird flu how I move that sick-ness
Got my money lookin' healthy, work to stretch it every day, we call it physical fit-ness
Made my name in the game from playin' no games but givin' these beats the busi-ness
It's a guaranteed conviction every time I kill a track, I'm lettin' you all wit-ness
We deserve a reward for bringin' back that boom bap rap that you miss-in'

That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it, I tell 'em I'm just cool like that
Alright, alright, alright, alright, that boom bap rap
When they ask you what you doin'
Tell 'em that you cool and keepin' it movin'
Ain't nothin' new, I'ma do what I do2Embed
