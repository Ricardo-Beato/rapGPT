Clock tickin', know you can't be playin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Gotta get it how you live, no delayin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Time's hard? No, you can't give up
Know what I'm sayin'?
Like bad luck, never get enough
Know what I'm sayin'?
What a shame, you the best, no less
Know what I'm sayin'?
Know life gon' put you to the test
Know what I'm sayin'?
Player like you, family, no less
Know what I'm sayin'?
Know God gon' put you to the test
Know what I'm sayin'?

My guy, you no work, you no job
My guy, you blink once, you sober
You see, this town wait for nobody
My guy just hol' your composure
And when you're down, it gets cold, I know, ah
My guy, don't stop now, keep moving
My guy, don't stop now, keep moving
We moving

Hands dirty 'cause I got it out the mud
Know what I'm sayin'?
Backstabbed by somebody you love
Know what I'm sayin'?
Everybody out here for theyself
Know what I'm sayin'?
You really think somebody else care?
Know what I'm sayin'?
If it wasn't for that, wouldn't be this
Know what I'm sayin'?
To get rich you gotta take a risk
Know what I'm sayin'?
On my own two, you know I gotta stand
Know what I'm sayin'?
They say, "Chances gotta make a champion"
Know what I'm sayin'?

Don't know nothin' but I do know this (What I'm sayin')
Don't know nothin' but I do know this
Don't know nothin' but I do know this (Know what I'm sayin'?)
Don't know nothin' but I do know this

My guy, you no work, you no job
My guy, you blink once you sober
You see, this town wait for nobody
My guy, just hol' your composure
And when you're down, it gets cold, I know, ah
My guy, don't stop now, keep moving
My guy, don't stop now, keep moving
We moving, we moving, we moving
We moving, we moving3Embed
