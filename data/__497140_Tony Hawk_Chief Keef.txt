18 ContributorsTony Hawk Lyrics
Ayy, damn, baby, look at these diamonds
Walk up in this motherfucker shining
Anything I want, I'm buying it
Tony Hawk

Walk up in this motherfucker shining, ayy
Damn, baby, look at these diamonds, ayy
Anything I see I want, I'm buying it
Tony Hawk, bitch, always grinding
Niggas on that hating shit, I don't mind it
Niggas know we about that violence
Seen the cops, I was hiding
Thots see me, I was sliding, ayy

Ayy, money be my right hand, ayy
I got my Breitling on my left, ayy, ayy
That money be my wifey, ayy
You know I ain't got no spouse, ayy
Look at that ho up over there
Look at that thot, watch I get her, ayy
She seen my ice then I hit her, ayy
What I do? Pass her to my niggas, ayy
I'm coolin' in Benihanas but I don't eat lobster
Bitch, I'm eating ten steaks, call me Sosa big pop'
Sosa 2Pac
Ridin' around the west side in Beverly Hills in a new 'Rari
She know niggas will never be too sorry like Tadoe
Ayy, with my bankroll
Don't get mixed in that mango
Come through chopping shit with my Johnny Dang on, ayy
You might also like
Walk up in this motherfucker shining, ayy
Damn, baby, look at these diamonds, ayy
Anything I see I want, I'm buying it
Tony Hawk, bitch, always grinding
Niggas on that hating shit, I don't mind it
Niggas know we about that violence
Seen the cops, I was hiding
Thots see me, I was sliding, ayy8Embed
