Woo!

I'm just tryna get my own, I'm up early in the mo'nin'
Gettin' it by all means
Gotta get this dough (Oh), oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh), oh (Oh)
But everytime I look over my shoulder
I see you and all your hatin', hatin' homies all up, all up
In my zone (No), oh no (No)
Oh no (No), oh no (No)
And your hatin' hatin' homies all up in my zone
Come on man (Hey! Hey!)
What the fuck he lookin' at me for?! (Hey)
You wanna do somethin'? (Hey)
Do something!

I say fuck you (Fuck you), get a life (Get a life)
Man, I got too much shit on my head
To have to deal with all of you (You), all you (You)
All you (You), all you (You)
I say fuck you (Fuck you), get a life (Get a life)
Man, I got too much shit on my head
To have to deal with all of you (You), all you (You)
All you (You), all you (You)
I say fuck you
You might also like
Listen, baby!
You've got it goin' on, your girlfriends say I ain't the one
They hate it when I call you, I can hear 'em
In the background on your phone (Oh), oh no (Oh)
Oh (Oh), Oh (Oh-oh-oh)
What you don't know about 'em, baby, when you not around 'em, baby
They be tryna holla, they be
Hidin' in the bushes of my home (Oh), oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh) ah-oh (Oh)
Listen, girl! (Hey)
You tired of your motherfuckin' friends
Hatin on your motherfuckin' nigga everytime he call
They's a bunch of motherfuckin' haters
Fuck them, boo!

Just say fuck you (Fuck you), get a life (Get a life)
Man, I got too much shit on my head
To have to deal with all of you (You), all you (You)
All you (You), all you (You)
I say fuck you (Fuck you), get a life (Get a life)
Man, I got too much shit on my head
To have to deal with all of you (You), all you (You)
All you (You), all you (You)
I say fuck you
All I can say is get a life
Quit your motherfuckin' hatin' and get a life
Get money, get bitches and get a life
Get it goin', get it goin', go get a life
All I can say is get a life
Quit your motherfuckin' hatin' and get a life
Get money, get bitches and get a life
Get it goin', get it goin', go get a life

Ooh, yeah
