Uh
Look

Pop Smoke will beat the box (Box), Pop Smoke will beat the speaker (Speaker)
Ice up on my neck, Kaniqua (Kaniqua), dot up on your head for reachin' (Reachin')
And I'm in the Bentley truck (Truck) with a bad bitch who eat up (Eat up)
And I'm off the Molly geekin' (Geekin') and it's 10K a feature (Feature)
Pop Smoke will beat the box, Pop Smoke will beat the speaker (Speaker)
Ice up on my neck, Kaniqua (Kaniqua), dot up on your head for reachin' (Reachin')
And I'm in the Bentley truck (Truck) with a bad bitch who eat up (Eat up)
And I'm off the Molly geekin' (Geekin') and it's 10K a feature (Feature)

AR when I walk through (Woo)
Twenty-five for the walkthrough (Woo)
Pussyboy, watch who you talk to (Huh?)
Say my name with a caution (Uh)
I walk in the spot, like who want it?
Gun to his head, I put jewels on him
Get put on your neck if your team lurkin' (Lurkin’)
Talk out your mouth and it's still barkin' (Barkin’)
These seven fifty's got my heart racin' (Woo)
Pick up and steal, like I'm Paul Payton (Woo)
Clipped him in vain, that's a call waitin'
Said "I ain't with the foolery, I keep a tool on me
Come out your mouth, you could get hurt"
Bro Trav' caught a man down (Baw)
Pop Smoke, I'm the man now (Grrrt)
