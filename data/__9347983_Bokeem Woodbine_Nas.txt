Pack up through the gate, you fi go ah! (Uh)
Drum pan, drum pan sound over so ah! (One-two, one-two)
Pack up through the gate you fi go, a weh you think? (Uh)
Sound boy have other songs that is going up in smoke (Yeah, ouch)

I know some goofies that wanna scalp me, ouch
Wipe out my accounts, leave me needin' mouth-to-mouth
But that just aroused my style
Then I party like I'm Tony in a South Beach house
Bars hittin' like I'm still livin' couch-to-couch
Motivation for the trappers livin' ounce-to-ounce
This is rockstar status, Neil Young with a bounce
I know that make you uncomfortable and make you say, "Ouch"

The snub nose like the Colombos and Bonannos
Rum in the cup holder
Hittin' bumps and spill on the sandals and car panels
I drew attention with artistic vision
Make an incision like Alonzo did to Joshua in Jason's Lyric
I think I caught the holy spirit, I put my soul in lyrics
Closed casket and we know who did it
E-S-C-O, I'm in the pole position, yo, she chose this pimpin'
Put the pain inside the music 'cause I know they listenin'
'Member I sat on Kool G Rap couch
Drank Olde E 'til we coulda blacked out
He pulled the track out, thinking 'bout what to rap 'bout
Snappin' like Chrisean and Blueface
Tradin' bars with the gods 'til they get the screwface
Ouch, I know that's painful like playin' hoops and sprain your ankles
Or gettin' robbed for your Jésus, your girl ain't stay true
That shit'll hurt you like a K do
Being crossed by your homie, wow he ain't the same dude
I'm bent off good wine like Bokeem Woodbine
Home readin' a script, lightin' up from a good line
Not no cocaine, this that crack though
She asked for my passcode, she got what she asked for (Ouch)

I know some goofies that wanna scalp me, ouch
Wipe out my accounts, leave me needin' mouth-to-mouth
But that just aroused my style
Then I party like I'm Tony in a South Beach house
Bars hittin' like I'm still livin' couch-to-couch
Motivation for the trappers livin' ounce-to-ounce
This is rockstar status, Neil Young with a bounce
I know that make you uncomfortable and make you say, "Ouch"

Ouch, my view is they only do it for views
Knife in my back and I wear the wounds (Ouch)
Like razor blades and lemon juice (Ouch)
I know it's hurtin' 'em how I move

Pack up through the gate, you fi go ah!
Drum pan, drum pan sound over so ah!
Pack up through the gate you fi go, a weh you think?

You a sniper, she a sniper
Ouch, that's a painful situation
Ouch, you know when they say jokes but it be real
Ouch, you might take it like they hatin’
Pain pills can't even help you
Don't even matter if you're sedated
And you be swearin' you that boy
Then why shorty got you waitin'?
Ouch (Ouch), ouch (Ouch), ouch (Ouch)
Yeah, yeah, ouch
Shit, it feel good, it feel good!
Shit feel good, bruh
Feel good, it's that good type of painEmbed
