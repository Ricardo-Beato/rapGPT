Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide...

Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs, nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking about a black man heaven here
YouknowhatI'msayin? Yeah

Cadillacs are coming, from everywhere (yeahhh)
Liquor vibing good ‘cause love is in the air
To all you players and you pimps, smoke out and have a ball
And if your hoe is actin crazy, put her on the wall
Now now now everybody's dancing and just feeling right
I see all of you players got your sauce laid in more ice
I hope when all of this is over, as I get old, yeah
My kids'll have a story, that still be told, woo, huh, about

All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day e’rydayYou might also like1Embed
