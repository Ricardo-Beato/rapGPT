10 ContributorsEverybody Know Lyrics
Haa, Guwop in this mother fucker
808 mafia, TM

Everybody know, everybody know, everybody know
I got the strap hangin' out my pocket, everybody know
I'm a mother fuckin' killer a armadillo on the low
Got em brick for the low, so everybody know
I can bring it to your door, nigga, everybody know
Got the fire on me, I'll shoot through the door
If I'm standin upstairs I'll shoot through the floor
Dog food, black birds, yeah Gucci servin' crows
And yo bitch say she never seen a neck so froze
Got these diamonds on my chest, I'm so mother fuckin' blessed
Way back on Bouldercrest, then I was a walking check
I'm a man of respect, I'll shoot you in the neck
Leave you wet, fuck your vest, I ain't aiming for your chest

Got them bricks in the house and everybody know
Everybody know,  everybody know
Say 12 at the do', damn everybody go, everybody go
Man everybody go
Got the pounds in nigga, man I got em for the low, everybody know
Everybody know, everybody know
OG and Fresh serving with Guwop your do', everybody know, everybody know

Everybody know I'm a mother fucking G
Everybody know I'm in the mother fucking street
Everybody know everybody ain't fucking with you niggas
Most these nigga really be sweet
These niggas ain't sticking to the G-code
Pressure on em and these niggas fold
These niggas ain't lifting loads
These niggas ain't selling bows
Nigga I'm in the streets 365 , heater on ma thighs
Colombia drive
Yeah, tryna better my situation by paper chasing
These niggas hating but fuck it, keep these niggas waiting
Plus they ain't spending no money anyway so what the fuck is you saying
Nigga I'm gettin' money I love the money I'm sleeping with it
Yo bitch I'm creeping with it the clip look just like it's kicking
It's poking out, you see that bitch it's poking out
The rims is poking out, I'm who these hoes spoke about

Got them bricks in the house and everybody know
Everybody know,  everybody know
Say 12 at the do', damn everybody go, everybody go
Man everybody go
Got the powders here nigga man I got em for the low everybody know
Everybody know, everybody know
OG and Fresh serving with Guwop at yo door, everybody know, everybody know

Spend a hundred on the chopper, hundred on the bong
Hundred young nigga with a bong that's a dong
Hundred on my chain fifty on my ring
God know we with so icy gang
The bitch stand about 5'2, my money stand about 5'2
Do whatever I tell her too, might jump out the plane in a parachute
Now everybody know a real playing game
My young niggas they paru
Fuck a pig, bust at the pig, should have seen how that swine flu
Now I'm a G but who the fuck are you
Your old bitch I made her my boo
Got a bank roll that can't fold, got shooters on my payroll
It's me, Guwop, and Street Money Fresh
Every day cuttin' dope, boy fresh
1017 chain on my neck, and everywhere I go the boy stay on flex
And I got cars in my garage that I ain't even drove yet
Diamonds round my neck and my wrist that boy be frozen

Got them bricks in the house and everybody know
Everybody know,  everybody know
Say 12 at the do', damn everybody go, everybody go
Man everybody go
Got the powders here nigga man I got em for the low everybody know
Everybody know, everybody know
OG and Fresh serving with Guwop at yo door, everybody know, everybody knowEmbed
