11 ContributorsFaces Lyrics
Got 200k in my earlobe, don't put shit in my bill fold
Got a young ho, 10 years old droppin' dick like a bulldozer
Got my older ho she's a real soldier pulled over in Minnesota, 10 bales of doja and a new Corolla
She let it go and she still goin'
Blowin' on some shit real potent
Slow motion I'm still toastin'
Wrist glowin' no discoin' but I'm kickin' shit like I'm field-goalin'
If you didn't notice, I'm gun-toting, I start commotion don't need promotion
Way more money than an average person, bad bitch buy shoes and purses
Brand new Bentley I'mma close the curtain, pack came in so back to work
Faithful to his girl, he a loyal dude but these racks on me a make her start the flirting
Say he gettin' racks but he missing payments
Back to the basics I'm in the basement
Got a trap house wit' a weed house in Jesup
Pockets so hard they had to call the station

Faces, faces, I seen so many places
Pockets full of dead white guys that's plenty faces
Faces, faces, I love that white; I'm racist
Don't wanna see no new faces, Rubber bands on all my faces
Faces, faces, I've been so many places, I've met so many woman
Tryna skeet on all they faces
Faces, faces, pretty face I love to baste it
Bad bitches I paint they faces, get face on a daily basis
Faces, faces, these niggas scared to face me, you know you pussy face it, mask on my face like Jason
Faces, faces, I trap and rap - two faces
The feds they keep on chasin', fuck around I'mma change my face
You might also like
I caught a case and had to change my face
They was on my trail, but I got away
Faces equal paper, faces buy you cases, favor for a favor
Faces equal blessings, faces equal flexin', faces stop the stressin'
I say fuck the feds and free Jerry Chester
He gave me a blessing, lotta niggas telling
He just make the call and I relay the message
Nigga I want it all, I'm talking faces
In every state I ball, In different places
Don't you piss me off, you'll be faceless
Wit' my back against the wall, I still made it

Faces, faces, I seen so many places
Pockets full of dead white guys that's plenty faces
Faces, faces, I love that white; I'm racist
Don't wanna see no new faces, Rubber bands on all my faces
Faces, faces, I've been so many places, I've met so many woman
Tryna skeet on all they faces
Faces, faces, pretty face I love to baste it
Bad bitches I paint they faces, get face on a daily basis
Faces, faces, these niggas scared to face me, you know you pussy face it, mask on my face like Jason
Faces, faces, I trap and rap - two faces
The feds they keep on chasin', fuck around I'mma change my faceEmbed
