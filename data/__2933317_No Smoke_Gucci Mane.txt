21 ContributorsNo Smoke Lyrics
Huh, whew
Honorable Court
Heh

Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke

You keep on postin' these pictures holdin' these straps but you a non smoker
You ain't no gun toter, pussy you ain't no real soldier
You ainâ€™t made your enemy have to buy his homeboy's mama no black roses
Choppa knock ya whole head open
Now the young nigga head smokin'
Nigga stop that pump fakin', who the fuck is you Tom Brady?
My young niggas dumb crazy, might snatch your old lady
You ain't caught no body, nigga, you ain't shot nobody, nigga
Doin all that woofin' and we know you shook, we ain't scared of nobody nigga
MAC 90 with a telescope, y'all thuggin' on Periscope
Man I thought you were supposed to sell the dope
Then why the fuck is you filmin' it
Finger fuckin' my F&H, baby lets get intimate
Think like a gangster, nigga, dress like a gentleman
You might also like
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke

My shooters they don't pose for pictures
They ain't doin' no rappin nigga
You ain't hit no licks, you ain't sold no bricks
You ain't did no trappin' nigga (no)
These rappers feminine, I'm headed my many men
I don't need no niggas to like me, bitch I'm a grown man
Let me give you a lesson, Guwop I'm Bouldercrestin'
You and all them non smokers go to the non smokin' section
We see them choppers blammin', fuck all that Instagramin'
You think you was killin' Cam Newton the way that nigga scramblin'
Partner that's your life you gambling, 'bout to cause a stampede
Pussy 'bout to leave his ho in the club, tryna run away from me
Better have a plan B, you understand me
Gucci done by no nigga living, don't care if you nine feet
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke
Why you flexin' boy, you don't want no smoke3Embed
