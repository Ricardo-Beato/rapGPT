11 ContributorsHow I Do Lyrics
Gangsta!
Cardi!
B!

This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

Pull up like huh?
They looking like what?
Heads turn left and right, they wonder who's her?
Cardi B, duh
Bitch don't front
You on my Gram all day, don't play dumb
Came up from the slums
The dirty, dirty Bronx
Where niggas quick to clip your shit, no fair ones
You gotta keep a gun, but beef to me is fun
I never back down, been this way since day one
You might also like
They shit on me before, thought I was just a stupid hoe
They tight now, they realize they was sleeping on gold
Took me one year man, and now I'm doin' shows
Now they wanna take pics with me, hold on let me pose
Believe me, I easily can do a bitch greasy
I'll give it to you just how you like it girlll
Cardi B in full effect, couple bitches upset
Couple niggas wanna hit it and they can't so they stressed

This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

Cardi in tune, bitches make room
Test me? The gat goes CLICK, CLACK, BOOM
Gangsta Bitch, oooh, Volume 2
Cop somethin' mean, when it start you hear that VROOM
Pull up to your side, 30 deep right?
Stuntin' on my ex, he thirsty for a reply
Sick, sick, sick
Call my phone, it's CLICK
Had me fucked up when you was fucking with that bitch
Making power moves
Goin' 50 on 'em
Same ones that played me
High-siddity on 'em
Back to back with it, goin' Drizzy on 'em
Now they tight, they gotta watch me make a milli on 'em

Ha-Ha!
Yo, yo, Remember, remember nigga when you told me that I was gonna work in that strip club Divas on 177th in the Bronx for the rest of my life? Well guess what nigga? Now i'm the fucking diva
Shit
Fuck outta here
GANGSTA!Embed
