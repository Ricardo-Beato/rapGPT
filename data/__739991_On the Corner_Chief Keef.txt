11 ContributorsOn the Corner Lyrics
Damn, Sosa
No one smokes weed out here on the, on the corner
No one smokes it like you, man
You smoke trees all day (DP on the beat)
These motherfuckers don't know what they're doing

No one on the corner got swag like us, like us
No one on the corner swag like us
No one on the corner tote fucking straps like us
No one on the corner gonna get a bag like us, ayy
No one on the corner tote jocks like me
No one on the corner let it pop like me
No one on the corner
I swear no one on the corner

No one on the corner tote a strap like Sosa
No one on the corner let it clap like Sosa
No one on the corner make it happen like Sosa
No one on the corner is the captain like Sosa
Ridin' in the whole appetite though
Wherever Benji go, that's where I glo
Seen too many hoes, get too many hoes
No one on the corner got it like Sosa
Flexin' on these niggas, 'bout it like So'
Smokin' ganja, nigga, never light hoes
I'm a handyman, I let the pipe go
If you're scared, nigga, read a Bible
You might also like
No one on the corner got swag like us, like us
No one on the corner swag like us
No one on the corner tote fucking straps like us
No one on the corner gonna get a bag like us, ayy
No one on the corner tote jocks like me
No one on the corner let it pop like me
No one on the corner
I swear no one on the corner

No one on the corner get money like Sosa
No one on the corner got them hundreds like Sosa
No one on the corner rock shows like Sosa
No one on the corner rock hoes like Sosa
These bitches love Sosa
If you're fine, you'll get closer and closer
These niggas hate Sosa
It's okay, I'ma put them thangs on ya
Gasoline you first, then flame on ya
Volcano your ass, King Kong ya
The chopper come do rats, lame gone, yeah
Who got somethin' on him on the corner?

No one on the corner got swag like us, like us
No one on the corner swag like us
No one on the corner tote fucking straps like us
No one on the corner gonna get a bag like us, ayy
No one on the corner tote jocks like me
No one on the corner let it pop like me
No one on the corner (DP on the beat)
I swear no one on the corner
DP on the beat
DP on the beat
DP on the beat
DP on the beat2Embed
