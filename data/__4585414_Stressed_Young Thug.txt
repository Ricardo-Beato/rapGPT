Got me stressed (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
I don't wanna rest (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
Smoking cigarettes (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
Get it off my chest (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
I don't wanna stress (Oh)
But I can't help it thinkin' if I lose the rest (Oh)
And I can't help it, I don't wanna stress (Oh)
But I can't help it, yeah (Oh)
No, no, no

Well, it's that gat toting, pistol holding nigga on your damn street
Pussy nigga usually pop a trigger if the hand speak
Lackluster, I'ma smack suckers this year
I'ma make a hundred thousand racks off of this here
Do the math, hundred million for the slow ones in the class
Type of bags I be gettin' be too big to pay in cash
Send the wire, send it fast 'fore I might just change my mind
Nowadays, a million dollars barely worth a nigga time
I ain't sayin' I'm the richest nigga that's in this shit (But I'm one of them)
Barely check my account, nigga, I'm admittin' it (I don't give a fuck)
Fuck around with my bread, bet you I'ma find out (I'ma catch you, nigga)
Couple niggas I deaded know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Nigga, don't play with me, I got a wife, I got a baby to feed
I got a mama to spoil, I got a brother, got a few legal fees
I got a daddy and shit
Medical bills, credit to fix
People to pay, label to run
You play with your life if you play with my funds, nigga
