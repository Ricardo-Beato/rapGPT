You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

I'm on what? What you on to?
I'm the sun god, let me warm you
Out of my sides the Lord formed you
Pull your dress up, ain't nothin' formal
Our fragrance is patience
We could major in communication
Relatin' like we cousins, though we kissin' though
Love can be sick or medicinal
A doctor of it, you gots to love it
God body language I be spittin' while we fuckin'
In your ear with somethin' that ain't clear
On your inside it appear, so somehow you hear
I'm sayin' I wanna stay inside
They say I'm a deep nigga, I'ma go way inside
Of everything you are
Cause everything you are is my lovestar

You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You might also like
I ain't the type to be all up on your social
I'm in your face vocal the way a man supposed to
A choosy lover, I chose you
God's most beautiful creation, let me mold you
You already in shape, that's more love to make
Feel free when I'm with you, it's hard to escape
When we need a break
We take it
When two souls connect you can't fake it
TV shows and cakes, I know your favorite
Cut from the same cloth, let's wear it
This ain't about labels, this about fit
Since God designed, we can start our own line
Our offspring will be you, me, and He combined
We walk the runway like blaow
Bein' in love is never out of style

You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

Heaven agrees you are all that I need down here
Cause you make it all worth it
We do this on purpose
The love we make is certain
I'm so caught in your aura, get lost in your force
I want to be your everything forever, forever
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

Forever, I wanna be forever
Forever, star
