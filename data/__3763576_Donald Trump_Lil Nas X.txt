27 ContributorsDonald Trump Lyrics
Ricky!
It's in the trunk (Yeah, yeah)
Pop the trunk and let you meet lil' Donald Trump (Pop it)

I got thirteen hammers, need a reason why
I should clap a nigga, send 'em in the sky
All you rapper niggas finna run and hide
I got that yoppa, pussy niggas finna die
Got a choppa, call it Donald Trump
'Cause it's loud as fuck and it hate niggas
Got some llamas, leave 'em in the trunk
Call 'em fishin' rods and you the bait, nigga
Yeah, my name is Lil Nas
Bitch, never call me Lil Naz
'Cause if you do, I promise you
I'm comin' through and I'm bustin' ass
Got a lot of cash in the stash
If you touch that, then you getting splashed
Got a bad bitch with a thick ass
She a stripper ho, yeah, she get cash
My flow incredible
Swae Lee; unforgettable
Pussy niggas keep talkin' shit
I'ma have 'em singin' to the medicals
I don't fuck with no federals
Fuck 12, them niggas terrible
They set you up, yeah, I know what's up
So I keep it tucked and accessible
Yes, I'm in college
I'm smart as fuck, here come my degree
Don't let that knowledge
Fool you, boy, yeah, I know the street
Could've been a alcoholic
Poppin' mollies, all I smoke is weed
I'm so hyperbolic
It's hydraulics on my fuckin' Jeep
Wait, I mean my damn Lamborghini
I do it big, never did it teeny
Bad bitch, polka dot bikini
Shootin' niggas, like eeny, meeny
Miny, moe, catch a fuck boy by his toe
Take his ho
If he talk shit, let it blow
Leave that nigga six feet below (*gunshot*)
Shoot a pussy nigga like— *gunshot*
Pull up on 12 like— *three gunshots*
Ain't no pretendin', all my niggas winnin'
We trendin', we sendin' them— *three gunshots*
Pick up the Glock, nine on the dock
Blow your shit up, like we up in Iraq
Sellin' them rocks, I Milly Rock
You niggas can't rap, go get back to your jobYou might also likeEmbed
