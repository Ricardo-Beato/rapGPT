Uh

I can't even sleep, I got so much to say (Yeah)
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DEA (Fuck 'em, DEA)
I can't even sleep, I got so much to say (Yeah)
Ex-drug dealer, used to sell a brick a day (Skrrt, brick a day)
I can't even sleep, I got so much to say (Yeah)
Recoverin' drug addict, I used to drink a pint a day
(Pint a day)
I can't even sleep, I got so much to say (It's Gucci)
Recoverin' drug addict, I used to smoke a pound a day (Pound, pound a day)

(Zaytoven)
It's Gucci (Gucci)
No sleep
Burr, burr, burr, burr-burr
I'm out here
Zwizzop (Skrrt)

When the sun comes out it takes the rain away ('Way)
But just like Noah, it been rainin' the last forty days (Day)
Takin' pain pills, tryna take the pain away ('Way)
Sold my first 8-ball and bought me my first pair of J's (It's Guwop)
Momma cussin' out these disrespectful-ass J's (Momma)
They knockin' on the door, know I'm just in the 7th grade
I'm mixin' codeine pills and molly in a lemonade
I feel like Price, get so damn high, might just die any day (Purple)
For all you junkies that's addicted, please don't get offended
I'm a recoverin' drug addict and that's not my intention
That OG gas hit my mailbox like a magazine subscription (Yeah)
My doctor in the feds for writin' bad prescriptions (Doctor)
I got so drunk, I left Privé and I crashed a Bentley (Woo)
I'm a mathematician, I'm too stoned to miss it (Stoner)
I got the best intentions but I made rash decisions
Throwin' cash at bitches, spend like half a chicken (Half)
Before I started rappin' I was worth half a ticket (Half)
Took your stash to get it, or spent it so fast it's silly
I drop the top on my Rolls Royce, I ride past the prison (Go, go)
They hate with a passion, I guess that's the new fashion, is it? (Yeah)

I can't even sleep, I got so much to say (Yeah)
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DEA (Fuck 'em, DEA)
I can't even sleep, I got so much to say (Yeah)
Ex-drug dealer, used to sell a brick a day (Skrrt, brick a day)
I can't even sleep, I got so much to say (Yeah)
Recoverin' drug addict, I used to drink a pint a day
(Pint a day)
I can't even sleep, I got so much to say (It's Gucci)
Recoverin' drug addict, I used to smoke a pound a day (Pound, pound a day)
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DEA (DEA)
I can't even sleep
I can't even sleep, I can't even sleep, 'day18Embed
