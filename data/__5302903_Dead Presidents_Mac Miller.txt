Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead ******* presidents to represent me (Whose...)

It’s Easy Mac, yo
Yeah, yeah
Please acknowledge me, fuck the dreams of equality
I oughta be a leader but ain’t nobody follow me
World wants to swallow me right into the dirt
But fuck that, I’d rather a clique put three in my shirt
I’m headed to heaven, crash landed in hell
My moms ain’t understand that she’s the 
She got me trapped like a cell so I put on some L
And lay back ASAP, I’ma yell my farewells
I excel from the other side of the world
Where the grass is greener and the shells carry pearls
And I’m here now, but one day I’ll be gone
Until then I smoke a big L and put it on
'Cause I just live my life like that
Instead of fightin' back I chill and write rap
'Cause I dream of the day where people pay to have my songs
You hate my style 'cause it’s ancient like Babylon
And when rap is gone, I’ll be too
You won’t see me anymore, but I’ll see you
And free you? Nah, I’ll think I’ll keep you a slave
'Cause your mind is in the dark like the back of the cave
And back in the day... well, I wasn’t here
Visine in my eyes, still nothing is clear
If hip-hop is dead, then I’m the resurrection
Represented by presidents, all same complexions

Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead ******* presidents to represent me (Whose...)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)

Yo, yo
I got a target on my chest, red dot on my head
I be hiding from the monsters I got under my bed
Everybody has their demons, leave ‘em preying on his needs
AIDS infested semen, leave 'em cleaning this disease
The word without a meaning, I'd be fiendin' for the trees
It’s Easy Mac, I’ll be mackin’ it with ease
I’m the king of the land, the air and the seas
Please, who you know that does it like me?
Yeah, now my mind's fucked up, like I just took a Valium
I’m sorry daddy that I didn’t bring back medallions
No grades to put up on the fridge
And I’m sorry that I didn’t grow up as a kid
'Cause I grew up like a man, you need to understand
That I know that everything I got was put up in my hand
Yeah, it’s my life, so you need to let me live it
"Kid's so privileged," "kid is so gifted"
You never liked my fitteds, call me The Mad Hatter
But I’m killing wack rappers, cats that rap wacker
Thought I act black 'cause I’m my sagging jeans
And I’m just doing my work while I’m bagging up weed
Yeah, the haters, man, they nothin' to me
He told me that I gotta work hard, nothin' is free
Yeah, it’s all in my mind for the paper
Mother Earth is mine, I'ma take her
Dead ******* presidents to represent me (Whose...)
Dead ******* presidents to represent me (Whose...)
Dead ******* presidents to represent me (Whose...)
Dead ******* presidents to represent me (Whose...)
Yo, put your Ls up real quick and say
