6 ContributorsNervous Lyrics
So tired, my eyes
Slow ride
Ok

I can feel you're nervous
But can't consider purpose
I practice verses 'till they're perfect
They say I'm wasted time, it's worthless
Sometimes, I even think the same
Smoke good, it'll always ease the pain
Sunshine gon' always beat the rain
Carpe diem, nigga, always seize the day
I got a couple prayers for the churches
Always double layers in my verses
Damn, they putting mayors in the hurses
Where there's more to life, there's a purpose
See, I try to teach to you
Tell you little niggas what you need to do
No ceilings, you can't see the roof
Know we all tryna cop a Bean or Coupe
Have I failed as a mentor?
Little niggas in the prison, never listen cuz they been poor
Reach to them but they still gonna send more
But they'll be ok like ten, four
Just keep your head up, if you fed up
Find a different way to get the cheddar
Just copped the Benz, fuck a Jetta
Now all my friends doing better
But we still gotta grind though
Waking up early morning, no alarms though
Got your bitch so wet, need a poncho
Only love me cuz a nigga on a honcho
But I fucking got to get it
But the feds got a problem with it
Switch flows, that was my decision
End the hating, we stop division
But ain't no way they gon' stop divisions
You might also like
We must keep it going (keep it going)
Like the breeze that's in the ocean (ocean)
Baby find a piece, to keep the motion (motion)
Cuz we rolling and we rolling
And I'll admit my wrongs
Wondering if I was right alone
Know the thoughts and feels when you alone (alone)
But we on and we on

And so I left the wave, riding like Poseidon
Cameras flashing with the light, it's so exciting
Down and out but feeling vibrant, never violent
If a nigga ever trying, he be dying
Cuz I got a couple cousins who be busting
We tryna chase a sack but I ain't rushing
They quick to bring the gats, they never bluffing
Taking your shoes and cash, and that ain't nothing
All, back to the middle with a hat
And a little bit of wax, with the fit up in a match
Attack when it brittle, with the gat so belittle, with a patch
But you never find the facts
Another crime that's going unsolved
Police sirens after gun drawls
Blow is cold, it's never unthawed
Make them hits, you rappers punch soft
Took a "L" but life's a front, loss
Lesson learned so I'm less concerned
And the boy flow dirty like infected germs
So sick, let me fuck, you might catch the burr
No remedies, just enemies
And I get angry off that Henessey
Now my heart colder than ten degrees
But this shit ain't new, dawg, I been to b's
But
We must keep it going (keep it going)
Like the breeze that's in the ocean (ocean)
Baby find a piece, to keep the motion (motion)
Cuz we rolling and we rolling
And I'll admit my wrongs
Wondering if I was right alone
Know the thoughts and feels when you alone (alone)
But we on and we on1Embed
