3 ContributorsRLTK Lyrics
5-1 not 5-0, Im'ma be 52
Bomb drop non-stop spitting on you
Never have so many been screwed by so few
Call to save y'all, so whatcha wanna do?
(Whatcha wanna do? Whatcha, whatcha wanna do?
Whatcha wanna do? Whatcha, whatcha wanna do?)
At the age I'm at now if I can't teach
I shouldn't even open my mouth to speak
Real talk raising strong down from the weak
My name is Chuck D, I got Tea Party beef
Why represent where you can't sleep?
40 aches jackass is six feet deep
Lost in the same space y'all call the streets
I walk real talk across these beats
At the age I am now If I can't teach
I shouldn't even open my mouth to speak
I bomb drop on those that be making y'all weak
24 hours a day, 7 days a week

I be the king from the streets of Hollis, Queens, New York
The only thing you get from DMC is real talk
The cow makes beef and the pig makes pork
I gotta walk this way cause it's the way I walk
From the halls in the hood to the halls of fame
I got that East coast flavor and that West coast game
I jam with jackal and Jesse James
You gotta call me the king when you say my name
I go hard for the people in the streets (real talk)
The king of the rhymes and the beats (real talk)
Adidas is the sneakers on my feet (real talk)
And it's the children in the streets we gotta reach (real talk)
You might also like
I rock on real talk the way the side walks
Whats up with the radio inside New York
Underneath them streets, man-made concrete
Is Mother Earth and God's work
This ain't new cause y'all ain't never knew
No tears, tell your peers inform your crew
Cause truth is truth no matter what I think
I take out garbage when it tends to stink
No joke, no smoke, I don't drink
Mr. Chuck D, tweet me so we can link
See I been your age, you ain't been mine
Feels like I was born a second time
This rhyme I wrote took a long ass time
Leave that wackiness way behind
At the age I am now If I can't teach
I shouldn't even open my mouth to speak
I bomb drop on those that be making y'all weak
24 hours a day, 7 days a week

I be the good crowd rocker, the best mc
I be the world's greatest rapper if you want me to be
But all that crap means nothing to me
If I can't give 'em vision and something to see
It's more powerful than your politics
All you stupid politicians can suck a thumb
Me and Chuck d, we do not run
Like my man said, a change is gonna come
So don't be stupid, don't be so dumb
There are no cuss words for y'all to beep
But I am cursing out the leaders that are still asleep
And all you wack-ass rappers, your talk is cheap
See my talk is really real cause my voice is deep
Now I used to rock rhymes with the reverend
From Run-DMC there's nothing better than
The microphone killin', head severin'
And if you're sick of whack rappin' I'm the medicine
Noise of my voice, voice of the voiceless
Against the racist, classist, homophobic, sexist
Xenophobic that sits so deep within us
Can't get help from those famous just to be famous
The powers that be separate us and hate us
When you need em, they go on hiatus
They hate us, it don't matter
They can't mistake us for somebody else
They tried to break us
No need to dumb down or even young down
Cause my standards is high
They can't understand it
Some of them can't stand it, they can't understand it
Songwriter y'all know it, more than a poet
Living life not lies, so the people can know it
At the age I am now If I can't teach
I shouldn't even open my mouth to speak
I bomb drop on those that be making y'all weak
24 hours a day, 7 days a weekEmbed
