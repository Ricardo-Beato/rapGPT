10 ContributorsKevin (VeeVeeVee) Lyrics
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt

My lil' baby missin' (Beep, beep, woo)
Thank God I'm Christian V
Hellcat (Yeah), lemme shift to V
Bought a new house and it look like Heaven (VV)
Had the MAC-11 when I met my reverend (Beep)
7-11 (Beep), shells and shelvings (Beep, ah)
Walkin' to class, I'm the coach like Kevin (VV)
Lot on my plate, fuck out my way, turn a nigga down, damn (VV)
Talkin' my talk, walkin' my walk, if a boy dare be flexin'

Bend to the back, yeah
Fuckin' up Saks with the bank teller (Beep)
Four, five hoes out at Coachella
If you knew better you'd have done better (VV)
Hoo, hoo, double down, back
Hoo, hoo, run up my racks
Hoo, hoo, VIP truck
Hoo, hoo, FN tucked, yеah
I buy this shit and I give it away to my brothers
All of this drip, won't get cluttеred
She give me the buns, I get it buttered
I'm rich as a bitch, no, I ain't stuttered
Closed the top of the whip like a shutter
I didn't wanna shuttle, beat with the shuttle
Feel like Odell, I'm really a rebel
I'ma be real on you shit with the metal
You might also like
My lil' baby missin' (Beep, beep, woo)
Bitch, thank God I'm Christian V
Hellcat (Yeah), lemme shift to V
Bought a new house and it look like Heaven (VV)
Had the MAC-11 when I met my reverend (Beep)
7-11 (Beep), shells and shelvings (Beep, ah)
Walkin' to class, I'm the coach like Kevin (VV)
Lot on my plate, fuck out my way, turn a nigga down, damn (VV)
Talkin' my talk, walkin' my walk, if a boy dare be flexin'

Go head
Shit if said it I did it (Go head)
Seen her with me then I hit it (Yeah)
And I got head like fitted (VVVV)
I’m up in Fifths with a bag, bitch
Baby Rolex on the wrist (Vee)
She lookin’ chocolate as shit
Take her to the room, get hit (VVVV)
Im on some  ass shit
Disrespect as fuck
In the club with the ones
Don’t break it, throw this shit on her butt (Uh)
Oh, all me Jack Frost with the ice
Diamonds they whiter than rice
Penthouse, suite, same flight
My lil' baby missin' (Beep, beep, woo)
Bitch, thank God I'm Christian V
Hellcat (Yeah), lemme shift to V
Bought a new house and it look like Heaven (VV)
Had the MAC-11 when I met my reverend (Beep)
7-11 (Beep), shells and shelvings (Beep, ah)
Walkin' to class, I'm the coach like Kevin (VV)
Lot on my plate, fuck out my way, turn a nigga down, damn (VV)
Talkin' my talk, walkin' my walk, if a boy dare be flexin'Embed
