4 ContributorsDopeman Lyrics
I'm a dope man, dope man, dope man, dope man
Gucci stay fresh like the dope man, dope man
Everybody holla at the dope man, dope man
Come and spend some dollars with the dope man, dope man

Yeah I'm the dope man
Something like the Birdman
Ridin' outta town
50 birds in my 'burban
Servin', splurgin'
You could say I'm workin'
Got washing powder
I ain't talkin' 'bout detergent
Young nigga coppin' 9s and 4s
Got me in my trap house
Standin' over the stove
My money long like Pinocchio nose
That's my why trap open early
And the bitch don't close
Man I love the trap
And if my arms were big enough
I would hug the trap
Because I still do the dirt
I'm in the carpool lane
'Cause it's me and my work
I got a trick up my sleeve
Got a 5 grand plate quarter
Brick up my sleeve
Niggas call me the dope man
The whole hood shoppin'
Gucci Mane, I'm the dope manYou might also likeEmbed
