12 ContributorsIt’s Alright Lyrics
This a classic, just add this to the rest of them

See, I know what y'all like (Yeah)
That's why it's gon' be alright (Turn me up)
Every day and all night (Yeah)
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
(If y'all could feel how my face felt, you would know how Ma$e felt)
See I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright (Come on, I hear John Legend)
Every day and all night (Yeah)
Ma$e is back, it's gon' be alright
Harlem back, it's gon' be alright (Come on)
Fo' Reel, it's gon' be alright (Yeah, uh)
Ma$e is back, it's gon' be alright

Ma$e said come on, Mike said shamone
Started up early like Raven-Symoné
Keisha Knight-Pull, Emmanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothin' handed at all but did I complain
Every time magazines tried to taint my name
But ya'll can't hold me down like restraint
I took the "T" up out the word can't
'Round same time when Nas said I can
Bush for sendin' our fam to Iran
I'm in the club with Henny, ass in my other hand
Lord, please forgive me, I'm just a man
Right now I'm trying to make some adjustments
'Fore they do me like they did Janet and Just' and 'em
Me and my cuz and them
Trying to rap like Bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I ain't never ever accept no money from these so-called sponsors
They was in Benzs, I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm, yeah, that something to ponder
The money I make on this one's for Donda
That's West to you, you the next
I can't hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal, nigga
You might also like
See, I know what y'all like (Yeah)
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
Holla back, it's gon' be alright
For real, it's gon' be alright
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright

Arm froze and all, Dom Rose and all
Maserati, Bugatti the roads and all
Different color Louis open toes and all
I tried to tell the chick don't expose it all
Country dudes mouth full of gold and all
Bay area chick, cornrows and all
I do it right, I do my wife, I leave the hoes yo y'all
From the boutique, I might close the mall
I drink my Geico and turn it Gecko
I wave the Roley, you wave the Seiko, need I say mo'
More diamond than LisaRaye
I'm no replica, I am the DNA
Breeze cool, leave you like a hurricane
Somebody get killed, the whole borough blame
M.A. dollar, what a thorough name
No matter who come through, I'm forever the king
I shoulda neva left the game, that's what a cutie said
Still chicks throwin' me up like newly weds
I'm grown and sexy, done with the groupie head
In the milk-white Phantom seats, and ruby red
You heard the rumor, listen to the facts
I drop my cars in pairs like pitty pat
When I'm done with this track, it feel like Biggie back
The game is country, I came to bring the city back
I came, I came to bring the city back
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
See, I know what y'all like
That's why it's gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright
Holla back, it's gon' be alright
For real, it's gon' be alright
Mase is back, it's gon' be alright

Fo' Reel, put your hands up
G.O.O.D. Music, put your hands up
Bad Boy, put your hans up
Roc-A-Fella, put your hands up
Chi-Town, put your hands up
N.Y., put your hands up
Miami, put your hands up
Texas, put your hands up
Tennessee, put your hands up
London, put your hands up
Japan, put your hands up
All around the world, all around the world
L.A., put your hands up
A.T.L., put your hands up
Man, this gon' be...1Embed
