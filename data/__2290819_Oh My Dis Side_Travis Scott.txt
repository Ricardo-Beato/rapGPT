Young rich nigga from the Northside
Paid my dues on this side
Flippin' the bricks on this side
I made it out the hood, I'm on the other side
All my niggas on this side (This side)
Keep it one hundred on this side
Love to get money on this side
No new niggas on this side (This side)
Look at my diamonds, don't get blind (Don't get blind)
You better handcuff your ho with a zip tie (Cuff)
'Cause we'll take her, bust her down on this side (Woo)
Broke niggas stand to the left side
Handsome and wealthy on this side
I came from the bottom
And now I'm on top, that's phenomenal (Phenomenal)
This side, this side, this side, this side
If I did not make it, I wonder where I would go (Oh!)
This side, this side (This side), this side (Uh)
Graduated from the midget (Woah)
This the life I was livin' (Woah)
Graduated to a million (Woah)
It's the money that I'm gettin' (Woah)
Graduated from a hotbox
Now I'm ridin' 'round in a Bentley (Skrrt, skrrt)
This how we do it on...
This side, this side (Woo), this side (Uh)
Always, always this side
This side, this side, this side

You never come around past midnight
Midnight, midnight

Just right, on this side
Find everything you need, everything you need on this side
This side, this side, this side, this side198Embed
