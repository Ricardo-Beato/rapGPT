28 ContributorsMichelin Lyrics
I just put a silencer, Almighty
On my gun, Glo Gang
Know how we rockin' like cut off stockings
Keep kush in our pockets
Fuck nigga, stop it

I just put a silencer on my gun (Ayy, ayy)
I'm just like a scavenger on a hunt (Gang, gang)
These hoes don't like a nigga, they like my money (Ayy, ayy)
These niggas don't like a nigga, they all want somethin' (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Well, I'ma send my savages on a hunt (Ayy, ayy)
I had to put a bounty set on my hunt (Put a bounty set)
Show no love, that shit get you killed and get you caught (Shit get you killed and get you caught)
I'm rollin', I'm Almighty Sosa Michelin (Ayy, ayy, ayy, Almighty Sosa Michelin, man)

Rollin' like the Michelin Man, with my many mens, ayy
Fuck your petitions man, ayy, let's get it, man, ayy
What's up with Benjamin? That's a nigga friend, ayy
God came and got me out and he let a nigga in
I remember pushin' white O's like the Michelin Man, I remember robbin' white folks for they shit, lil' man
I remember totin' my pole ready to get your man, I remember sellin' white dough to the piggies man
'Cause they came to get me, man, ayy, I'm at my grandma's house
And I let them in but I ain't open my mouth, ayy
They say "How I get that?" I told 'em "My grandma ah get a damn check
Get my damn shit, and I spend it on dope"
They ask "How I sell it", I say "I break it up, hoe, and put it in the bags
And then I sell it to those clucks who come to my door tryna get a fix thought, and buy this shit though"

Pockets like Michelin, hundred Benjamins (Huh?), don't do division (Nah), on my dividends (On my dividends)
'Cause my homies in penitents (Ayy), doin' sentences (Doing), green face my president, Hundred Franklins

So much designer, I might change clothes, True Religion (True Religion)
Just might pull up in the Range Rover, hop out the minivans (Hop out minivans)
Kickin' doors with Timberlands (Ayy), but I made it out (But I made it out)

Just got off the phone with Sosa, he say "Make it count" (He say "Make it count")
Money on the counter, money on the couch (Money on the couch), so we gettin' a check (Gettin' a check)
You better not send no shots 'cause then we send it 'em back (Then we send it 'em back)
I do not like no Prada, wear Giuseppe with that (Wear Giuseppe with that)
