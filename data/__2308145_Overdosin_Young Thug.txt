36 ContributorsOverdosin Lyrics
Ricky Racks
Uh, uh, uh
Thugger Thugger
I rock water like a fuckin' whale
Drug got expenses like a fuckin' bill
I like girls, I'm a fuckin' male
Nigga movin' slower than a snail, watch me

Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Yeah)
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

The walls are closin', I'm overdosin'
I'm cookin' some fish, she put on some lotion
I'm stackin' that money, I want it the oldest
Bitch, I am a warrior, you know that it's in me
I'm hangin' with players, you know that I'm pimpin'
My son is suspended, can't ride in the Bentley
What's wrong these birds? These birds are trippin'
Four thousand on shoe strings, you know I ain't trippin'
One minute I swerve, baby, call them birds
Tell it right to her face, put that dick in her life today
Thugger bring 'em Benjis to the T
I don't need a door to hand over them keys
Have a white T look like Miskeen
Batter up, polo, saddle up, football tackle, hut
Pussy nigga, caterpillar, Stuart Little, hike
Get fresh, diamonds everywhere, styled by, my Ike
Paris Hilton, Master P Miller, big C member
You might also like
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Sheesh)
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I OD, ODB, dirty nose, coca√≠n'
Neck, ears, wrist, fingers, Aquafina, wreck the Bentley
Bought the Vette, had wreck in that, growin' green like a Chia Pet
Bought a condominium just to smoke in it 'til I vomit and I'm so honest
London just walked in I'm like, "Goddamn, man, I miss my bro" (London on the Track)
Your bitch just walked out with Young Thug, now you like, "Damn I miss my hoe" (Give her back)
I'm the type of nigga that nut on her back end
You the type of nigga that can't miss that hoe
You the type of nigga that kiss her in the mouth after she drank my Olay, ohh
Drink it, drink it, cop a new coupe, yeah, sank it, sank it
Hundred bands ain't a damn thang, I'ma spread it out, need to pay, pay
Catch me riding with your main thing, I'ma feed her bands, no cuff links
I can even say the same thing, my fans geeked up, they on the same page

Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Sheesh)
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)3Embed
