16 ContributorsI Got Swag Lyrics

I don't really think she want me back then, she want me now
She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up

I was a real bum now I'm really rich, kid
I come through the hood in some really, really sick shit
The Rolls, the roof gone, your flows, they're lukewarm
It's why you're not me; nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
She like the kid, my lifestyle what she wanting
Bottle after bottle by the bar, I be stunting
It's Gucci this, Gucci that, Gucci hat
Big doofy gat, hit you in your kufi hat
You know me, I told your ass in '03 "Get Rich or Die"
G-5 I fly, write my name in the sky
Pick an island on the map, I been to it
Shorty wanna try anal, her friends do it
Wrists rocked up shining, flawless diamonds
You could hardly see the face on my Audemar time and
On that J.T. shit, me I'm bringing sexy back
Louis belt wrapped around right where the TEC be at
You might also like
I don't really think she want me back then
She want me now
She can play games all she wants
She cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper
I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper
I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up

Getting paper's my objective, yup, now your chain gone
One false move and clap, now your brain's gone
You like me, you aight with me; me? I'm into me
I destroy my enemies even if they're kin to me
Do 'em like the Kennedy's, ching-ching that's mo' bread
Say something slick out your mouth I'll come for your head
She likes me more than you can imagine
Bad bitch, look like she fell up out a pageant
Closest I'mma get to heaven in this lifetime
Is right below her waist in between her thighs
Call her Pussycat, that's my nickname for her
And I ain't got to buy shit or run game on her
See when I stunt she stunt, we stunt together
Oh, you don't like how that sound? Aw nigga whatever
We both rock Bugarri, both push Ferrari's
I go so hard in the paint, I'm sorry
I don't really think she want me back then, she want me now
She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up

You want me? I want you - plug one? Plug two
I'm infinitely special, girl
The Lord's gonna bless you if you do what I tell you to do
You want me? I want you - you want a Benz? I'll buy two
You should want me like you want success
Girl, with us together we'll be better than the best
Why settle for less?

I don't really think she want me back then, she want me now
She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up1Embed
