I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
Quarter million on a spaceship
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
Half a ticket on a Jugg house
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
50 bands around both wrist
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge

Cop me a jet ? pontiac with turbo
I got the juice I drip the juice
I’m in pursuit of bigger loot
On a ? for wider lips
A quarter million on a ship
I taken off on every flip
I’m rolling kush and out a zip
Go to cali take a trip wrap me up a birthday gift
I come back like my birthday here go walk inside the dealership I’m tryna buy the dealership
Catch a whip and sell the chips from ear to ear my ice is dripping I’m soaking wet from chain to wrist
I make the girls get soaking wet my chain be glistening my life so fucking interesting
Every chance I get I go and buy expensive shit, take them racks and throw the shit
I lose my mind tryna’ blow this shit, I keep up with the splurging shit

I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
Quarter million on a spaceship
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
Half a ticket on a Jugg house
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
50 bands around both wrist
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge

Heavy ass the Louis
I’m shining you looking blurry
Just look at my arm these water diamonds in my jewelry
I’m splurging in Lennox, I’m splurging in Onyx, I’m splurging in Platinum
You wrapping that magnum, when alley boy drop I’m going platinum
I’m smashing, I’m taxin’, I’m blasting and cappin’ you rapping
Guaranteed that ? gonna buss up when that case start flashing
No cases I got assigns I splurge in the latest fashion
200 sitting on the dash when I pass ya I’m still matching
I fuck with my nigga future but dont fuck with j future ricky
These sissies talking like bitches I’mma make that bitch
You snitching don’t get it twisted
Go through racks and still splurging
Duck tape them and in the streets going hard we still splurging nigga
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
Quarter million on a spaceship
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
Half a ticket on a Jugg house
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
50 bands around both wrist
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge

When I’m in name brand clothes I’m materialistic
Got a condo for a closet in the latest addition
Got them brand new diamonds catch a pack of them chickens
Come through chop off thats a suicide mission
Pop so many fuckin bottles I can see when I’m pissing
Told you ? motherfucking niggas better do your edition
Jugg House 3 stories, caught one play in one chicken
My niggas throw up them sixes, trash bag full of midgets
Cashing out off the fishes, 50 bands on my wristes
Go and top two M6’s, Migo call in a minute
Go and buy me a Bentley, like to get in and spin it
How to spend a quarter million splurging at Lennox
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
Quarter million on a spaceship
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
Half a ticket on a Jugg house
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
50 bands around both wrist
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurge
I splurge, I splurgeEmbed
