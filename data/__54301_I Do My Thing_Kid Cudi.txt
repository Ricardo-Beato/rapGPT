Yeah (thats right, lets go)
Yeah (lets go, lets go)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah (I'm extra good)
Yeah, yeah

I smoke I drink I do my thing
I'm livin' in my own world
And if they hate I let them
Who gives a fuck?
Anyone who know about what I do
I'm livin' in my own world
I chill back and I
Spread peace n love, yeah

Have you ever led an alliance?
A bunch of stoner kids livin' life through defiance
Remember back when couldn't cop not one damn appliance
White tee, wrinkled and a mug
Adopted my mothers luck and quick wits
So I spy me a bobbin' head bitch from a mile away
Girls stay a mile away
Do the single lady dance by them other mother fuckers
Nah mean?
And why it gotta be about the ride, ride
At the bar place upon my car in the lot
And I'm blowin' smoke and the dro when I know my loans
Got me thinkin' huh? Where's plain pat at?
All I really know is that go time is about more than a night
Go now I feel a slump
You can't judge me cutie, I'm reckless
I got some mysteries that's confronted when the blunts lit
You might also like
I smoke I drink I do my thing
I'm livin' in my own world
And if they hate I let them
Who gives a fuck?
Anyone who know about what I do
I'm livin' in my own world
I chill back and I spread peace n love, yeah

First off, fuck all the cloners
Can I shoot a shoutout to all the stoners?
No fingerprints, these isotoners
I'm still buyin' half Ps up off the corner
A nigga on one, better yet I'm on two
Whatchu waitin' on, blaze up, you want to?
Shake and take, get cakes they can shape and scrape
Got the whole world talkin' bout snoop
We wanna wake n bake,
Well lets go
Kid Cudi, my buddy, he got the best smoke
MCs n Gs yeah this the west coast
They say trees is trees
Nah, that's ses loc, let me deftly originate
So you'll appreciate the state of mind
When I'm flyin' high through the friendly skies
Open up your eyes and recognize
Mothership connection connected
Yeah, we gettin' hella high
I smoke I drink I do my thing
I'm livin' in my own world
And if they hate I let them
Who gives a fuck?
Anyone who know about what I do
I'm livin' in my own world
I chill back and I spread peace n love, yeah
