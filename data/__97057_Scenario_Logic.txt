Three in the morning, the pancake house (Come on!)
Four in the morning, we'll be rolling to my house (What?)
Five in the morning, the lights go out
Six in the morning, you can hear her start to shout (What?)
Seven in the morning, she’ll be callin' a cab
Eight in the morning, talkin' about the  fun she had (Come on, come on)
Nine in the morning, man, she just gettin' home (Yo, yo, yo)
Talkin' about the overnight scenario, scenario
Three in the morning, the pancake house (Come on!)
Four in the morning, we'll be rolling to my house (What?)
Five in the morning, the lights go out
Six in the morning, you can hear her start to shout (What?)
Seven in the morning, she’ll be callin' a cab
Eight in the morning, talkin' about the fun she had (Come on, come on)
Nine in the morning, man, she just gettin' home (Yo, yo, yo)
Talkin' about the overnight scenario, scenario

The way I blew up on the scene you think Osama did it
The way I’m addressin' DC, you'd think Obama did it
This is for the ladies in the crowd, gettin' loud
My intelligent women, you dumb bitches ain't allowed
I'm reppin' DMV, so you know I'm proud
They gave me a license to kill and I'm doin' it right now
On the rise like DOW, with a Jones for this rap shit
At the ten headin' for the zone watch me catch it
That VISA flow ‘cause I’m accepted everywhere
Getting credit now beware, I’m the tortoise you the hare
See I took my time to design this rhyme
Perfectin' every synonym, every syllable slowly killin’ them
Why spit game when I could just get to drillin' them?
I think I’m going too fast, let's slow it down like Ritalin

Three in the morning, the pancake house (Come on!)
Four in the morning, we'll be rolling to my house (What?)
Five in the morning, the lights go out
Six in the morning, you can hear her start to shout (What?)
Seven in the morning, she’ll be callin' a cab
Eight in the morning, talkin' about the fun she had (Come on, come on)
Nine in the morning, man, she just gettin' home (Yo, yo, yo)
Talkin' about the overnight scenario, scenario

Yeah, I’m spittin' crack
Now I’m marrying the game, burying these lames
Where I’m from? Maryland’s the name
Radio play is necessary in this game
See I dream of Jeannie Jones playin' my demo at home
Get excited, call Tigga and let him listen through the phone
But that ain’t happenin', so I’m doing it on my own
If you think that you street, then meet me at the chili bowl
Or maybe hit the water front and we can really flow
You know I’m really cold, tell your girl to bring the fur
After I beat ya, hit Ibiza and I’m bringin' her
One in the A.M the club causin' mayham
My homie C Dot got two women tryin' to lay him (What?!)
Two in the A.M, they got my music playin'
Begging me to hit the stage, but I’m like, “Who’s payin'?”
Three in the morning, the pancake house (Come on!)
Four in the morning, we'll be rolling to my house (What?)
Five in the morning, the lights go out
Six in the morning, you can hear her start to shout (What?)
Seven in the morning, she’ll be callin' a cab
Eight in the morning, talkin' about the fun she had (Come on, come on)
Nine in the morning, man, she just gettin' home (Yo, yo, yo)
