35 ContributorsThe End Lyrics
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Yeah, it's been a long time coming, and you know this all I got
I've been sacrificing for years while the rest of y'all have not
These motherfuckers want my spot, catch me slipping? I think not
So I'ma do this shit until the day my body rot
I said, I'ma give it my all, never slippin', I won't fall
Down to fight right to the death, you know I been ready to brawl
Swear to God, I seen it all, hold up, let me paint that picture
I was poor, you was richer, but I'm in the ring witchu
Hold up, wait, now let me hit you with some real shit
Open up your mind, maybe you'll find that you can feel this
I had nothing, came up with somethin' and I still got it
Motivated by the shit I seen, boy, it's so hypnotic
Yeah, look to my left and see my brother selling drugs
Uh, look to my right and see my sisters fucking thugs
Ain't it funny how this life go
One moment you're in the dark, but when that light glow
It's like you're seeing for the first time, as I penetrate your mind
Like a burst of ammunition that was shot out of a nine
I'm givin' everything I got, so, yeah, it better be my time
They said I'd never make it, that's the reason I still rhyme now

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen15Embed
