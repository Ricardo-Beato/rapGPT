2 ContributorsSometimes Lyrics
Okay, I grew up with the regular thugs, I thought I'd tell you that
I thought, I thought you noticed that
Hanging with the hustlers, gettin' love from all the older cats
Listening to B.I.G., taking notes whenever Hov would rap
Looking up to Pun trynna learn to rhyme
Fantasized about Kim when I was only nine
I still remember when Nas told me the world is mine
But it was dark and hella tight around that fuckin' time
I never really had no money, all the pressure was free
Nowadays I'm out for presidents to represent me
Nowadays I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
You only think that you the shit because you never met me
Shit, I've been vibin' out since I was two
Back when Puff and Mase was wearing them shiny suits
Back when Wu-Tang was killing shit and I salute
Swear I shed a tear to Ghostface's "All that I got is you"
Yeah I'm influenced by the leaders of the East Coast, music to the death of me
Big L, Guru, Big Noyd rest in peace Jam Masta Jay too dammit
Lost a lot of great ones but they never'll vanish
I remember speaking Spanish, mami 
Let me hit you with the 
I remember bumping Fugees back when Lauryn Hill was there
Back when she would sing the sweetest shit a man can ever hear
Cyrus put me on the Onyx back when I was twelve
'Til I stole the tape and started jamming by myself
Shit Noreaga made me feel like I could be myself
Then got convicted saying some shit that everybody felt
And that's just real
You might also like
Sometimes I wanna cry and pry
Somtimes, sometimes I wanna chillay
Sometimes, sometimes I get drunk all God damn day
Sometimes I wanna go back around the way
Sometimes I wanna ride and smoke
Sometimes, sometimes I got money and I still feel broke

I guess my middle name must be He-Ain't-Shit
Every time I'm in the club bitches be like: "He ain't shit!"
All of my niggas know we ain't shit
It's some niggas trynna make it out this pre-game shit, word
I break bread, red, hundred dollar bills
Had to go independent I was running out of deals
Low commission, I was free as can be
Now a nigga back in business like I'm EPMD
Wishing I could be Talib like a motherfucker
Living just to get by is not enough for us
Couple kids and the government be blessed of us
I guess this is it, knock your niggas' blockbusters
, fuck what you talkin' 'bout
I used to bust some Cool J's, momma said: "I'll knock you out!"
A boombox, two pays to clean your Cogney mouth
With the ill nine or two ways to meet Foxy Brown
Yeah I'm influenced by the leaders of the East Coast, music to the death of me
ODB, MCA, Freaky Tah, rest in peace Jam Masta Jay too dammit
Lost a lot of great ones but they never'll vanish
I remember bumping Lost Boyz, I ain't even care
Let me hit you with the Black Rob shit until you scared
I remember bumping Black Moon and Buckshot, I was there
Back when he would say the hardest shit a man could ever hear
Daddy put me on the gangsters when I was twelve
'Til I stole the tape and started jamming by myself
Noreaga made me feel like I could be myself
Like I can vent and say some shit that everbody felt
And that's just real
Sometimes I wanna cry and pry
Somtimes, sometimes I wanna chillay
Sometimes, sometimes I get drunk all God damn day
Sometimes I wanna go back around the way
Sometimes I wanna ride and smoke
Sometimes, sometimes I got money and I still feel broke

Ayo shout out to all the different regions that helped to build this hip hop shit and make it great
West, South
But on this one I wanted to talk about where I'm from and some of the shit that inspired me coming up
See, young niggas from the East Coast don't really pay homage no more, and I know there were those that paved the way for me
Out here, and I wanted to acknowledge y'all, word
Joyner!Embed
