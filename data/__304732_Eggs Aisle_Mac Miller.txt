47 ContributorsEggs Aisle Lyrics
I've hung around with the best out
Smile with my chest out
Shit, I've been stressed out, they thinkin' I'm depressed now
I just wanna go and chill at Kanye West's guest house
Bitch pull her breasts out, I forget about my ex now
Feelin' fresh out, chillin' in a penthouse
Been here for so long 'bout to start payin' rent now
She used to cook me breakfast 'til I turned her to a pen pal
I'm at the grocery store, lost in the eggs aisle
Ten-point takedown, Alabama shakedown
Used to rapid eye movement, beautifully awake now
Think I ain't a superhero, need to check my cape out

Dripped up and draped out
It's all good, you safe now

Be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya
So, be safe, homie, be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya

Yeah
And everything will be cooler
Maneuver away from evildoers
If Gene Hackman is captain, no one can beat the Hoosiers
See the future, no crystal ball that I'm starin' at
Ancient Egypt pharaoh rap starrin' Jack Kerouac
A half-a-ton of cattle dung, this shit I sadly have become
Ashin' blunts 'til I'm left with only half a lung (Half a lung)
Yeah, I'm here, self-proclaimed deity
Cryin' durin' the Lion King, that's just the G in me
Highly offensive, been on both sides of the fences
Hence the confusion when I stare at my reflection
Man's duality, life and its formalities
We're born as potential, then leave as a casualty
I'm in the lab, suited up, performing alchemy
Meditating 'til I'm levitating out my seat
It all started with a PayPal
You might also like
Dripped up, draped out
It's all good, you safe now

Be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya
So, be safe, homie, be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya26Embed
