11 ContributorsVentalation Lyrics
RJ

Ayy,  it's too many to choose from, I can't pick (Ayy)
I  grab two, we dip out and take pics (Yeah)
New car and I lose calm, my favorite (Ayy)
Poolside, I skinny dip with gay chicks
Nah,  I don't usually be the one that amaze, man
I  do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part  of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
It's part of my ventilation
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation

Groupies hit my phone, they just tryna lick the lollipop
I'm  too cold, but I'm the type to make your body hot
Feel like Keith Sweat, feel like Jodeci
I need the winner's club, hope my ex don't notice me
Can't save hoes, I just move to the next one
Nonchalant ass, I could tell I just upset some
Sick cup, big yup, treat 'em like my stepson
Colora-rado make me have to come and flex some
I be moving militant, yo' bitch be moving sideways
I be getting paid shows, vacay on the holidays
You be with them lame niggas, I be on the finer things
Two step my way to a bag, get up out my way
You might also like
Ayy, it's too many to choose from, I can't pick (Ayy)
I grab two, we dip out and take pics (Yeah)
New car and I lose calm, my favorite (Ayy)
Poolside, I skinny dip with gay chicks
Nah, I don't usually be the one that amaze, man
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
It's part of my ventilation
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation

Take a deep breath, now what you tryna do?
Doggy Dogg with the shit, but I'm not a fool
When I step up in the party, hoes know the rule
And if the bitch can't swim, sit by the pool
Light up a Backwood, I'm back, hood
What's cracking? I keep a bad bitch with me, that's how I do it
Caked up like it's my birthday, nigga, feeling good
Then blow out the candles and wish a nigga would
Fuck around with the reason your ho stuck around
Niggas wanna act funny, I got a bunch of clowns
I make money to play with, to stay rich
Hoes wanna label the nigga, but say, hey bitch
Ayy, it's too many to choose from, I can't pick (Ayy)
I grab two, we dip out and take pics (Yeah)
New car and I lose calm, my favorite (Ayy)
Poolside, I skinny dip with gay chicks
Nah, I don't usually be the one that amaze, man
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
It's part of my ventilation
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation

$tupid Young, uh
Hold up, nigga, let me ventilate
Nigga say he run the building, well, it's time to renovate
Forever paid, nigga, I can never hate
Never catch me lacking even when I'm in a Escalade
Pull up with them extra clips like a movie
Lil baby bad, tell her bust it like a Uzi
Fucking with the gang, but I'm knowing she a groupie
Tell her no pics and videos, she fuck around and sue me
Young Asian hood nigga from the ES
Ray Charles, man, I think they can't see us
Ah shit, and these diamonds on me VS
Niggas hating on the gang 'cause they can't be us
Ayy, it's too many to choose from, I can't pick (Ayy)
I grab two, we dip out and take pics (Yeah)
New car and I lose calm, my favorite (Ayy)
Poolside, I skinny dip with gay chicks
Nah, I don't usually be the one that amaze, man
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
Part of my ventilation (Ooh, ah)
It's part of my ventilation
I do this all the time, it's part of my ventilationEmbed
