Se-e-e-exin' you
Care-e-essin' you
I'ma treat you like the one
'Cause you is the one

I'ma tell you I'm so proud
I'ma tell you I'm so proud
If I ain't told you in a minute
I'm so proud, I'm so proud of you
Se-e-e-exin' out loud
Se-e-e-exin' out loud
Fle-e-e-exin' right now
Fle-e-e-exin' right now
Drop tops in the wintertime, oohooh
Drop tops in the wintertime, with security
We the new illuminati
We the new illuminati, babe
All about us, fuck them
We the new illuminati

I got the set
That you fuck with the set
When I give you the set
Ain't be holding me back
Gotta hold me down with you
Nothing to lose, ain't got nothing to prove
When you freakin' on me, and I'm freakin' on you
Gotta ride it like a goon
Soon as I'm ready and able, I give you that paper
This ain't no favor, I'm flexin' like I got somethin' to prove
Trap out the Ghost like a throwaway
I could never see no hater
I got five percent tint all around me, yeah
Fine hoe, Yeezy
Ain't no manners
This nigga's too fake and they never could see me
No ya, ya, yah
Big pile, stretched out
Alligator, crocodile on my seat
Playa hater, long, see you later
Left foot, right foot, let me see you step on my command, piss 'em off, what's worse is we gon' do it with your friends
Sexin' out loud
Like guns sprayin' in the crowd
Lay low go and roll up
All shots fuckin' right now, yeah
You might also like
I'ma tell you I'm so proud
I'ma tell you I'm so proud
If I ain't talked to you in a minute
Im so proud, I'm so proud of you
Se-e-e-exin' out loud
Se-e-e-exin' out loud
Fle-e-e-exin' right now
Fle-e-e-exin' right now
Drop tops in the wintertime
Drop tops in the wintertime, with security
We the new illuminati
We the new illuminati
All about us, fuck them
We the new illuminati4Embed
