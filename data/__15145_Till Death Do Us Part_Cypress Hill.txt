2 ContributorsTill Death Do Us Part Lyrics
How many times have we been thru this
I can tell you that it's getting harder everytime I try to resist
We go way back and you held me down
And you helped me keep my feet moving in the ground
No matter what situation occasion
You were amazing, you knew just what it took to keep our love blazing
The thug in me, but when we separated I was thinkin foolishly
Remember when your ex boy tried to bug on me
I told him: "bring it on, I'll buy you a slug on me"
He didn't like that but didn't want the fight
Fuck 'im, he didn't know how to treat you right
We go hand in hand they don't understand a man
But you do and I really respect that, damn
We been down so long but it's all good
That's why I dedicate this song

Till Death Do Us Part
I do

Who would have thought it would last so long
So many loose-sighted think that they can't go wrong
I know I make so many mistakes
I know you felt neglected, you called me "outta line"
If you thought I didn't respect it - I heard ya
But I never showed an emotion
If I haven't ever said it, you got all my devotion
When I fell hard you picked me up
Made me think about my life, where I'm going, a little tricky - huh?
I know at times, that you thought I would change
But I'm the same motherfucking brother even in spite of the fame
There might be some times we don't agree on somethin'
But don't never feel your thoughts don't mean nothing
Some'll try to steer you wrong, I'm not one of those people
Always tell it like it is, cos the truth will free you, but don't get mad
When the truth is lethal, I'm only telling you cause I got your back
You might also like

You got my mind right and I don't know how you did it
When I trip not too many who can put with it
But you still there, still care, so rare - oh yeah
Got so much love, when you need, you can go there
I appreciate what you're doing for me
I had to open up my eyes so I can see the minutes we lost
Whenever I was out on tour, or gone, we can make 'em up, like never before
You want all the little things, that make it worth it
Why not, we can get it, we can both deserve it
It's hard, but nothing good, is ever so easy
We have a bond that won't break, no mistake, believe me
Till Death Do Us Part, like I said from the start
You're the light that guides me thru when I'm in the dark
They said we'd neverlast but we're still strong
That's why I dedicate this song - C'mon
