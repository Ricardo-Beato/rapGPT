Yo, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Niggas speak down on my name like I wasn't there for 'em (There for 'em)
Talk about back in the days, this isn't back in the days (Back in the days)
They want me back in my ways, chipped tooth and the fade (Tooth and the fade)

Uh, musically I'm on Mars
Walkin' all over the beat, puttin' my feet on the stars
I rock it like Lenny, thinkin' like Jimi the first time he seen a guitar
Standin' in front of where they shot Ahmaud and said we gotta know who we are (Know who we are)
Uh, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Wearin' rare Jordans straight from Air Jordan, this a fair warnin'
Too many young gods beef over nothin'
When you get money, you know that it's comin'
Sayin' they homies, but they ain't a hunnid
We the most hunted, uh
I got my Mets hat on to the back (Back)
Y'all already know where we goin' with the stats (Stats)
Hall of fame only, kings and queens only (Queens only)
They all be grabbin' my style but you know they can't hold me
Yeah, I'm in rare form (Rare form)
Y'all still on the ground, you know I've been airborne (I've been airbone)
Studyin' Big, studyin' Nietzsche
You gotta call in a chopper to reach me
Homie, I don't need a jeweler to freeze me
Ice in my veins, I make it look easy
Mentally, I'm in Queens
More money more problems, you gotta be ready for all that it brings
Let 'em say what they say, revenge on my plate, I'm lovin' the taste
They see you shinin', emotions get hard to contain
They just not evolvin' the same (The same)
Me and HB is too rare
I'm movin' all through the snares, sound on billionaire
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm flippin' the page
I'm Prince on the stage, SLAVE on his face
You know what they say, KD the wave
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days  (All of my days, Braveheart, Braveheart)

Levels of Tarantino
Curbin' my ego, even though he know
Empty glass of Pinot, cigars and casinos
What they especially praise is the ethos
Stacks on blackjack, movin' my chips
No superstition to make me get rich
I'm with this chick, just one I brought today
In between placin' my bets, we shopped at Cartier
Rose gold I copped her a set
Runway hopped in the jet, flight attendant poppin' Moet
I said I need that Dom, off of respect
We havin' conversations, niggas show me property then
I call my nigga Ant, I told him, "Yo, I gotta be there"
Salmon shish kebab, in a misty fog, rollin' sticky log
Big dawg affair, no kids involved
Roundtable havin' war council
Press one button, it'll change the world around you
Too rare, nothin' to see here, Cuban over my streetwear
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you just to be fair
It's okay to keep the mystique, I learned that in the street
On me, solo or deep, I'm puttin' on for the G's
Part III
(Hit-Boy)
We been doin' gangsta shit for a long time
Look inside my mind, see a gold mine
I'm my own cosign, she textin' the old line
You keep starin' at the glow, bitch, don't go blind
Braveheart energy, fuck all of the enemies
XO Hennessy, it's not on me, it's in me
I'm not here to be friendly, they ain't even contendin'
Comprende?
We've been doin' gangsta shit for a long time
Look inside my mind, see a gold mine
I'm my own cosign, she textin' the old line
Comprende?
It's up, Hit-Boy you on some other shit
We on some other shit, comprende?
