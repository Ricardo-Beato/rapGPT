6 ContributorsGet It Up Lyrics
Earrings, Outfits, New Whips, Tennis Shoes
08 baby but I’m
Iced out dog same size a cocker spaniel
Woke up this morning in a mansion
With a bad bitch started laughing
Started ballin like its my last day
But I don’t think so gotta start blastin’
Cars real clean but the whip game nasty
Ugly ass nigga but i pulled up in a  Phantom
Might be ugly but my car is really handsome

5 for a half, 24 for a whole, its the trap season
Everybody working the stove
Gotta get it up up, gotta get it up up, gotta get it up up
Country nigga get taxed and flexed for his sack
I’m laughing at him cause he can’t get it back
Gotta get it up up, gotta get it up up, gotta get it up up

Trap beatin junkies kicking plus a couple niggas owin’ me
Junkie hit the fence to come and test the dope for me
Got a couple bags they stashed
Good dope come in this week well shit hopefully
Can’t ask a nigga cause I ain’t with that front shit
But I’m ready to eat like school time when lunch is
Got rock salad yeah you with that crunch shit
Shawty whip the 62 and two and one one six
Got off white bricks, might cop six
On the way home he on the phone
Hard time trapping’ ass nigga just got tricked
Laughing’ at them lame niggas ha ha ha bitch
You might also like
5 for a half, 24 for a whole, its the trap season
Everybody working the stove
Gotta get it up up, gotta get it up up, gotta get it up up
Country nigga get taxed and flexed for his sack
I’m laughing at him cause he can’t get it back
Gotta get it up up, gotta get it up up, gotta get it up up

Who is this who is this
The boy you sold that dummy brick
Flex me for 120 can you give me something
(no,) I ain’t givin’ nothin back  ain’t no money spent, I done fucked it up
You could get 100 dubs, matter fact don’t call my phone cause
If you leave the gas you could get 100 doves
Gucci Mane La Flare beefing’ with 100
Fuck niggas like they hardly get car
Tied to a motor then toss into lake Laneer
Swimming with the fishes pull him up be a souvenir
Country nigga coming up by 20 with a bag of money
Devil on my shoulder and he telling me to take it from yaEmbed
