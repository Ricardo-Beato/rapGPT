Ridin' through the city and I'm coastin', yeah

Gettin' lost in the rhythm of the fuckin' flight
When the city lights shine and the mood is right
When you sippin', ain't no trippin' on the move tonight
Bring out the whole team, I'm on lysergic and it's worth it (Yeah)
I admit, in the zone, Mr. Rager, mane
See him in the streets, I'm takin' off, make him understand
In my world of view, swerve, never lookin' back
Forty-two, I do okay, I knew you couldn't owe me jack
And it's on, bigger bank, time to get it
Now Ben Baller did the chain, rosie goldy, homie, learn the name
Live it through the soul, if you didn't know know, learn the facts
Now it's super cold, we'll see a show with a broken neck

Uh, 2 Chainz, it ain't a stain on me (Alright)
DEA had tried to put the blame on me
My young niggas tote .30s, ain't no aim on it (Yeah)
And this a Cullinan, bitch, not a Range Rover, yeah (Yeah)
What's the difference? 'Bout three-hundred racks (Three-hundred)
I am so cold, it look like Freon attack
Had the bando with the peas in the back
But the odd part about it, we was evenly matched, yeah
I been coastin' since a Motorola (Hello)
Chicken toter, I sell more than El Pollo Loco
Emotions up and down like a rollercoaster
I put her sexy ass on the pole like wanted posters, yeah
