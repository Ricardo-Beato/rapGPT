44 ContributorsTrip Lyrics
Boarding completed
I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally

Uh, comin' down like I'm uphill
Hoggin' both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter 'cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas beggin' for attention, doin' extra-extra
Downgradin' yourself, you get an F for effort
Haha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious, hit Twitter lookin' me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speedin' on the 1-0-5 'til the fuckin' badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson
You might also like
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy, man, I always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby, open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you goin' out of town
'Cause I'm a trip

Landin' on another runway, fly with me
Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy
Nigga, we on like we never been, off straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey, lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way, lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face, lil' mama?
Embarrassin' yourself, get off the stage, lil' Mama
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga
Courtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy, man, I always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby, open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you goin' out of town
'Cause I'm a trip

Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smokin'
On some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet jumpin', the sawed-off pumpin'
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan?
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain comin'
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothin'
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy, man, I always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby, open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you goin' out of town
'Cause I'm a trip

How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
Good, hope to see you next time5Embed
