68 ContributorsDream Lyrics
A young nigga's life is a dream, yeah
We ain't lettin' no hoes get in between us
When my diamonds speak, they say "bling," yeah
Yellow diamonds, no crime scene, yeah (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
This that rich shit, I eat fish and grits (Yeah)
Catch me boolin' with my dogs just like Michael Vick (Yeah)
I don't give no damn if they throw it off
I won't fuckin' miss (What?)
Bitch, I'm so up, no Sleepy Brown
Wouldn't talk to him 'bout shit (No!)
You dig?

I want you to talk to the hand while I talk to bands (Brr)
I might go and stop playing, take over the land (Yeah)
My money long as school buses, ain't talkin' no Xans (Yeah)
Sit still, I'm cool comin', pull up and then spray it (Pfft)
50 dub, know I'm sayin'? (Woo)
Hundred bloods, them my fam (Blatt)
Hundred bloods, them not fans (Blatt)
Fuck the beach, I got sand (Fuck it)
PS3, I'm not playin' (Yeah)
Go gentle on my lil' man (Yeah)
She understand what I'm stayin' (Yeah)
I'm booted up, I couldn't land (Woo)
My car is fast, that shit drag (Skrrt)
Versace white, Ku Klux Klan (Yeah)
Don't care if he's Crip, he still fam (No)
No AM, bitch, I am (I am)
But when I do I might need help up (And what?)
And I wanna be like Mike and I ain't talkin' Phelps, bruh (Skrrt-skrrt-skrrt-skrrt)
