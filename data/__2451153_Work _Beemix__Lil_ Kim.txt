6 ContributorsWork (Beemix) Lyrics
Gimme that work
Gimme that work
You know that I got you babe
Show me what it's worth
Gimme that work, work, work, work, work
Gimme that work, work, work, work, work

I could never doubt you babe
Always by your side, always down to ride
Don't want to do this without you babe
Cause I can't see me without you in my life
Sit back and let me sex you up
Do not want to let you down
Baby boy let me fill you in
I can tell that you're built to win
Let me 
Choke me 
I am oh so into you
Let me fuck you slow
Please don't let me go
I just might fall in love with you

What'd you have for lunch today baby?
Would you like dessert?
Got my schoolgirl skirt on
I'm about to give you brain like a nerd
Now baby can you take me down
Cause I been out for way too long
You know these drinks got me too gone
You know this weed smoke got me on
You might also like

What you need work? I could give you that employment
Half a million dollar coupe just for my enjoyment
Bitch I got that work, el trabajo
If I run out I just hit Pablo
Mi no play no games, mi no come with console
Mi too wild in these streets, no control
Forty on me now and your nigga is the driver
He left you because your pussy was too dried up
And I got him mind fucked
G500 truck
Hundred thousand dollar shopping spree and I ain't bought him nothing
Rollies with the bezel on it
PJ with the medal on me
Hop up out the jet in a Bugatti
It's the one and only Queen Bee nigga, if it's about my cheese
I need a CC nigga if you sending that word out
It's like the cops raiding, how I'm sending them birds out
Ten toes down, I'm that bitch that you heard 'bout
Fucking with this pussy I could put you on the map
Fucking with this pussy I could take you out the trap
Yeah I rock Giusseppes, but Louboutins mi prefer
Let him purr on my kitty and buy mami some furs3Embed
