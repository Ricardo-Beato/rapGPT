6 ContributorsDJ Bobby Black Speaks Lyrics
Yeah, had to light up my dutch master
This gettin' ready to be a classic right here
This the official hood album, Kno Mercy
I go by the name of the kid Bobby Black
So you know it’s gotta be a classic
I got my man DJ Mars inside the building with me
Brought along my man Future
My antenna straight from the East side of Atlanta
Zone 6 to be exact, bitches
We call this one a hood album
'Cause I ain't got that other shit y’all DJ's got on y'all mixtapes
My shit exclusive, holla at me
Fast up, my people dyin'
Big Truth, all my people over there, I grab 'em up
Mixtape kings, I'm gettin' ready to shut my mouth man
Go grab your swishers, your Hennessy
Your dutch masters, whatever it takes for you to get fucked up
Your Grey Goose, we gettin' ready to jump this shit up
Let’s go inYou might also likeEmbed
