Yeah

Element of the surprise
Such a spectacular thing I cannot, lie
So many things people wanna limit you to be
I show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The negative that come out they mouth, so sad
When I smash, wipe the smirk off they face, my bad
Who bad? I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
At eleven I had to throw on the pants
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats, solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on, who gon' go half on a zone?
Oh, thought I would be done off that coke, no
Let me tell you some' ho
Ben said "Everything that shine ain't gold"
Been skeetin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been the nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really 'cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished, no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be ok, with being demented
By the way nigga, these cars ain't rented, I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted, look who the fuck it be
That skinny Cleveland niggie, I stay reppin' my city bitch
Been smokin', no jokin', Cudder's had that itch, so I scratch
You might also like
So please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted, I'm back
So please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted, I'm back

Niggas think I'm livin' life paranoid
Mothafuck that, man
Oh, they got me twisted, they don't know that boy
Mothafuck that, man
I'm just gettin' busy, killin' it, I'm gettin' busy
Mothafuck them, man
I just wanna watch 'em burn, baby, burn
Niggas think I'm livin' life paranoid
Mothafuck that, man
Oh, they got me twisted, they don't know that boy
Mothafuck that, man
I'm just gettin' busy, killin' it, I'm gettin' busy
Mothafuck them, man
Now it's time to watch 'em burn, baby, burn
Hahaha, yahm

Ahhh, ahhh, my leg!19Embed
