28 ContributorsYeah Yeah Lyrics
I know you know I know I need you here
That's probably why you're never ever here
You left my heart froze like cold turkey
All my diamonds cold like cold soda
Uh, oh, yeah, yeah

You'll probably never know the real story
You said your homeboy raps, can he afford me?
Cause I'm not doin' favors no more
You left my heart on the floor
Bitch, you cannot play me, I'm a lord
Trap 6, pop your spinal cords, woah
I broke your best friend's headboard
Dick so good, turn that hoe to George
That means she get curious
Hoe from 619, she mysterious
Pussy tsunami gang got me delirious
Oh, oh, but I don't need her
If she go hungry, I'm the first person to feed her
Yeah, yeah, shit is gettin' too real
Oh, yeah, yeah

Woah, I know you know I need you here
That's probably why you're never here
Oh, that's probably why you're never here
You might also like
I dropped the ball, yeah I fumbled
I dropped the ball, yeah I fumbled
I dropped the ball, yeah I fumbled
I dropped the ball, yeah I fumbled
I'm mature enough to say it
I'm mature enough to own up to it
I'm mature enough to say it
I'm mature enough to own up to it

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, that's probably why you're never here

Damn, I know I messed up our love
But trust me, baby girl, I'm worth it
I'm just hopin' that you heard this
I'm just hopin' that you serve this
She said just give me room, room, room
All she want is room, room, room
Fine
But you'll be runnin' through my mind
I think about you all the time
Damn
Baby, why you doin' me like this?
Why the fuck you not answerin' your phone?
What's up? What's really good?
Like, for real, are you fuckin' them hoes again?
Is that what's really goin' on after all we've... we've had?
Are you fucking serious, Miles?
Oh my God, like, let me find out
Let me find out that you an ain't-shit-ass nigga
Let me find that out though
You know what, it's cool, it's all good
Nigga call me back

I know you know I need you here
That's probably why you're never here
Oh, that's probably why you're never here
Fuck
You left my heart cold turkey
All my diamonds cold like cold soda
Oh, yeah, yeah
