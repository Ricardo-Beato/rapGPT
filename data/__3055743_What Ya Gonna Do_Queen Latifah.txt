1 ContributorWhat Ya Gonna Do Lyrics
Someone out there is heartbroken, mmmhmm
Someone out there feels all alone
Can't eat, can't sleep, cause you lost someone you really love
But you know what, you gon' get through it
Just pray on it, alright?

Tell me why
(Unfortunate situations you gotta go through)
Situations come and cut you like a knife
(Cause you to be overcome by sadness)
Exposes your smile and turn around
Into a frown and brings you down
(I know it gets to weigh so heavy)
So heavy on your mind
It's gonna take some time
(But sometimes I feel so low)
Oh, sometimes I feel low

(What ya gonna do when it happens to you?)
Tell me whatcha gonna do when it happens to you?
What you gonna say when your friends go away
What is there to say when a friend goes away?
(What you gonna do when it happens to you?)
Just pray, just pray, just pray
(All you gotta do is just pray on it)
You might also like
You're never ready
(When you lose someone you love so )
When the person you laughed with, talked with, trusted goes away
(And the loss of love it makes you feel sad)
To that special place that's written in the sky
()
I can't describe this pain that I am feeling deep inside
(Don't you think it's time to share)
Give it all to him

 (4x)
What you gonna do when it happens to you?
When you haven't a clue what to do?
When you're about to come unglued?
Just put your trust in who? God
Searching to find the truth
To find the light inside of you
Searching to find the truth
To find the light inside of you
Searching to find the truth
To find the light inside of you
Searching to find the truth
To find the light inside of you
Searching to find the truth
To find the light inside of you
Searching to find the truth
To find the light inside of you
Searching to find the truth
To find the light inside of you
Searching to find the truth
To find the light inside of you
You gotta search inside your heart
And don't let it tear you all apart
I know it's a struggle every day
All that you gotta do is prayEmbed
