Woo
I'm tryna pull up to he coast line and
Ask whip with Doc and Mac, ayy
You know when you step on that 300 to 500 feet
Where towers is on deck with lemons on 'em ("May I help you, sir?")
Ice cold Mimosas and shit (Cheers)
Oh yeah, it's 6 AM where I'm at
Cloud 9 to be exact (Cloud 9 to be exact, woo)
Uh, it took a long time to get here, I make it look easy
But it took a long time to get in this chair that I'm sittin' in right now (You have no idea)
(Woo, let's go)

But the main idea is to get her to dance to my song (Dance to my song)
Quite frankly, don't wanna see you with nothin' on (Nothin' on)
No robes on tonight (No robes on tonight)
No shoes on tonight (No shoes on tonight)
She goin' deep sea diving, goin' down, down, down tonight (Keep rising)
And I'ma keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep going, go on boy, don't ever stop (Don't ever stop, no)
I'm gonna keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
(Keep on rising, oh)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
When I take off or blast off, I ain't never stop (Don't ever stop, no, no)

This feel like a cocaine song, my bowl game strong
Baby say my stroke game long
She on everything, move and choose up, who ya choosin'?
In it to win it, get it crackin', now how ya doin'?
Maneuverin' while we movin'
Smoky in this motherfucker while we crusin'
We off the coast of France with a host of friends
Coastal winds get close again, you the most advanced
Take my hand, go with the flow
Do what I say and walk it out and pay attention
Don't you give it away
And once we make that clear
I'ma tell you what you wanna hear, yeah

But the main idea is to get her to dance to my song (Dance to my song)
Quite frankly, don't wanna see you with nothin' on (Nothin' on)
No robes on tonight (No robes on tonight)
No shoes on tonight (No shoes on tonight)
She goin' deep sea diving, goin' down, down, down tonight
(Keep rising)
And I'ma keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep going, go on boy, don't ever stop (Don't ever stop, no)
I'm gonna keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
(Keep on rising, oh)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
When I take off or blast off, I ain't never stop (Don't ever stop, no, no)
Uh, shawty my lil boo thing, put her in that Mulsanne
CREAM like Wu-Tang, yeah (Woo)
Got in that mad shit 'cause I'm rich and handsome
Diamonds on me dancin', yeah (Oh yeah)
Smokin' on exotics, say she from the Tropics
It look like she brought it, don't care though
Fuckin' fix the stitches in her hair though
Fuck yo last nigga, I know you used to the middle

Baby, don't deny what you here for
Wetter than the dimes on my earlobes
Lookin' in my eyes like it's tenfold (Tenfold)
Wanna knock boots like Timbo's
All up in your water, I'm so nautical with it (Ayy)
I see what I want and I gotta go get it (Ayy)
Once we get goin', I won't stop 'til you finish
But the main i-, but the main idea

But the main idea is to get her to dance to my song (Dance to my song)
Quite frankly, don't wanna see you with nothin' on (Nothin' on)
No robes on tonight (No robes on tonight)
No shoes on tonight (No shoes on tonight)
She goin' deep sea diving, goin' down, down, down tonight (Keep rising)
And I'ma keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
Keep going, go on boy, don't ever stop (Don't ever stop, no)
I'm gonna keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
(Keep on rising, oh)
Keep rising to the top (Keep rising to the top)
When I take off or blast off, I ain't never stop (Don't ever stop, no, no)Embed
