25 ContributorsF Him Good Lyrics
Uh, we had lunch
We talked about love and shit
She looked me in my eyes
And then said the next dick she'd take
Would be her husband's dick, damn
See, I had the steak, she had the lobster
I say, "I want you on my team," she say, "I don't join rosters"
"Oh, believe that," and then the drinks came
And then the mood changed and then her answer switched
She let her hair down and lit a cancer stick
She saw it turned me off and said she tryna quit
She went to the ladies room and I hopped on my phone
Most likely she doin' the same thing

Like, "Girl, what you think?
Um, should I do it?"
She say, "Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it"
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said
"That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga
That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga"
And then she say, "If you do, you better fuck him good
'Cause if another bitch could, she gon' f—"

We had dinner
We talked about the future
She said I could have chose any bitch
I would beg to differ, but beggars can't be choosers, yeah, mmm
And see, I had the shrimp, she had the pasta
She said she don't like rappers, we got something in common
I said, "Especially that nigga Wayne"
We both laughed and then the wine came
And then her mind changed
She loosened up her blouse, her smirks turn to smiles
It was a full moon when she turned around
She used my restroom, she say, "You know, girl stuff"
She left the water runnin' and hit her girl up

Like, "What you think?" (Haha)
"Should I do it?"
She say, "Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it"
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said
"That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga (Yeah)
That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga" (Yeah, yeah)
And then she say, "If you do, you better fuck him good
'Cause if another bitch could, she gon' f—"
We had breakfast, yeah
We fucked all night long and shit
We fell asleep naked, so when we woke up
She wanted that morning dick (I gave it to her too, hmm, yeah)
I had the grits, she had the waffles
She say she drank too much last night and I shoulda stopped her
I say, "Believe that," and then my phone rang
She saw my girl name and then her world changed
She put her clothes on and said, "I'm going home, Wayne"
I said, "Lisa, chill," and that was the wrong name
She hit her girl up and said, "I hate rappers"
And then her girl laughed and said, "Bitch, what happened?"

She said, "What you think?
Fuck, why did I do it?
Bitch, I bet that nigga knew he was gon' fuck
From 'Hi, how you doin'?"
And then her friend on the phone say
"Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga
Girl, I was just trippin', I woulda fucked that nigga" (Yeah)
And then she said, "Yes, I did, and I fucked him good
So I hope he tell his girl that I fucked him good"4Embed
