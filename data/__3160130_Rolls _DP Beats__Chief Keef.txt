7 ContributorsRolls (DP Beats) Lyrics
DP Beats
Ayy (Ayy, DP), ayy
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I'm 'bout motherfuckin' rolls
(All the hoes, I got all the hoes)
I'm 'bout my motherfucking rolls
Since 2010 (Glo Gang shit, Glo Gang)
I was sellin' dope (I got all the hoes)
Out my grandma front door, nigga (I got all the hoes)
Country knockin' (All the hoes, all the hoes)
Contact, climb through the back of the burglar bars (Bang, bang)
I ran out the crib on they ass, nigga (DP on the beat)
And I got indicted, I don't give no fuck, ayy (Beep)

I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes (All the hoes)
I got all the rolls, I be on the road (On the road)
I can count this money with my eyes closed (My eyes closed)
Ride by you, bye-bye, hoe (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
'Cause I'm 'bout my rolls, bitch, I'm 'bout my rolls
You ain't talking rolls, then I gotta go (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
I thought you know (I thought you motherfuckin' know)
Baby, I am 'bout my rolls (Bitch)

I'm 'bout my pesos, my rolls
You ain't talking pesos, I shoot you in your nose and your mouth
'Cause you wasn't talking right
Better bring that money to the light, bitch nigga
'Cause I'm a rich nigga, ayy
For a show, I need six figures
You talking thirty bands, I'ma take it
But your show, I might not make it, ayy
Hoes think I am Jamaican
Rastafari dreads, they be shaking
Pull up on they block, nigga, shake it
Click-clack, this ning ding finna get baking, ayy
Bitch, I eat bacon
But I don't fuck with pigs, see them, then I shake it
They gon' try to strip me naked
Take me to the cell, I can take it
It ain't nothin', ayy
Nigga try me, then it's bustin', 10-10
Call up 10-10, code ten
'Cause that ning ding be my twin, twin
That's the only friend I got, other than guap
My mama told me trust no one
Snakes in the grass, one of 'em gon' bite, ayy, ayy
You might also like
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes (All the hoes, hoes)
I got all the rolls, I be on the road (On the road, beep)
I can count this money with my eyes closed (My eyes closed, beep)
Ride by you, bye-bye, hoe (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
'Cause I'm 'bout my rolls, bitch, I'm 'bout my rolls ('Bout my rolls)
You ain't talking rolls, then I gotta go (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
I thought you know (I thought you motherfuckin' know)
Baby, I am 'bout my rolls (Bitch)

I thought you motherfuckin' know
Pull up, bitch, I'm 'bout my rolls
You ain't talking rolls, then we 'bout to blow
At your motherfuckin' skull and your fuckin' nose
And your teeth, nigga
We gon' make your dumb ass bleed, nigga, ayy, ayy
Thirty in this ning ding, nigga, ayy
It's a drill, bitch, ding ding, nigga, ayy
I got hoes, ayy, in different area codes
9-5-4, 3-1-0
9-2-1-0, ayy, ayy

I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes (All the hoes, hoes)
I got all the rolls, I be on the road (On the road, beep)
I can count this money with my eyes closed (My eyes closed, beep)
Ride by you, bye-bye, hoe (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
'Cause I'm 'bout my rolls, bitch, I'm 'bout my rolls ('Bout my rolls)
