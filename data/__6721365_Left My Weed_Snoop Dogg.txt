10 ContributorsLeft My Weed Lyrics
Ayy bro, who got smoke?
Swisher Sweet, Backwood, fronto, sky zone
Pure hemp what I roll
And a nigga need one pronto, I'm on
High as the condo
OG seasoned cilantro, I blow
I think I left my wallet and lighter in El Segundo

I can't believe it, believe it (Damn)
I do this shit every time, damn (Every time)
Get so very high and (So high)
Then forget
What I needed, I needed (What I need)
Did one of y'all see if I, damn (Can you?)
Searchin' like CSI, yeah (Look out)
'Cause I fucked around and left my weed, damn, damn (I left my weed)
I fucked around and left my weed, oh, damn, damn (Damn, I left my weed)
I gotta go and get my weed, damn, damn (Somebody pull up, pull up)
Or somebody gotta pull up on me, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, pull up to front, party goin' live
Everybody happy when the Dogg arrive
Boss in the building, party with a real one
Pocket full of racks and still number one bonafide
Show you right
Post up with a few bottles, a few models
Make a toast to the boss life, I do the honors
I make the hits to make the deals to make the dollars
And I smoke to that
Reachin' in my Louie bag
Tryna find that King Louie stash
Yeah, I'm 'bout to do em bad
Baby wanna take a flick
I'm like, "Cool make it quick 'cause I still can't find my shit"
Reach a little deeper, now I'm mad
No weed in the party, all bad
I'm in the parking lot, headed to the whip
'Cause now this party ain't shit
You might also like
I can't believe it, believe it (Damn)
I do this shit every time, damn (Every time)
Get so very high and (So high)
Then forget
What I needed, I needed (What I need)
Did one of y'all see if I, damn (Can you?)
Searchin' like CSI, yeah (Look out)
'Cause I fucked around and left my weed, damn, damn (I left my weed)
I fucked around and left my weed, oh, damn, damn (Damn, I left my weed)
I gotta go and get my weed, damn, damn (Somebody pull up, pull up)
Or somebody gotta pull up on me, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, shit, I did it again
Nigga movin' too quick, tryna get with my friends
To get fucked up, I got my coffee cups and the brewskis
But hold up, I noticed I'm missin' my ooh-weed
Like Snoop D, I need at least two Sweets to soothe me
Blunt wraps, Swishers and loose-leaf
Now I got to go back to the crib
And try to sneak in, I hope my gal don't shoot me
Thinking I'm lying, I'm trying to have a good time
Barbecue, music, the good vibes
Wonder should I make a call to come through with an ounce
When damn, I got two at the house
Now I got to make a decision
Should I hit the back door with precision?
Or maybe I should bum from my coffee brothers
They be gottin' Red Dead Redemption vision
I can't believe it, believe it (Damn)
I do this shit every time, damn (Every time)
Get so very high and (So high)
Then forget
What I needed, I needed (What I need)
Did one of y'all see if I, damn (Can you?)
Searchin' like CSI, yeah (Look out)
'Cause I fucked around and left my weed, damn, damn (I left my weed)
I fucked around and left my weed, oh, damn, damn (Damn, I left my weed)
I gotta go and get my weed, damn, damn (Somebody pull up, pull up)
Or somebody gotta pull up on me, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ayy bro, who got smoke?
Swisher Sweet, Backwood, fronto, sky zone
Pure hemp what I roll
And a nigga need one pronto, I'm onEmbed
