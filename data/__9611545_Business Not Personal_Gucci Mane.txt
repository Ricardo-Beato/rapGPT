6 ContributorsBusiness Not Personal Lyrics
(Once again, I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit)

I was writin' my raps while tapping my chest 'cause I ain't even had no beat (No beat)
I stopped complaining 'bout my shoes, I saw a man had no feet (Fuck)
Nobody would throw your dog a bone and I ain't had nothing to eat (Rrr)
Now niggas wanna sit at Gucci table, but I ain't even got no seats (No)
Ain't got no time but nothing but money, niggas be broke and bummy (Bums)
Nigga think I spent mine all on jewelry, they must be a dummy (Dummy)
I'm hiding in plain sight in they face, they don't see me coming (No)
I never wanted to go to space, just point me to the money (Go)
I ain't wanna go to college, went straight to the league (I went)
Started selling candy in school, then I graduated to weed
Hung with the neighborhood OGs, but none of the game was free (No)
When they in the kitchen, they told us leave, they ain't even want us to see (Skrrt, skrrt)
I seen a teenager turn a crackhead and it was so depressing (Damn)
It made him age, but he nineteen, but his hairline regressing (Well, damn)
Them bougie hoes, they turned me down, they know they missed they blessing
So broke, I remember my girlfriend birthday came, it had me stressing (Fuck)
This dud keep throwing out subliminals like I wouldn't catch it (Catch it)
Like I won't send a nigga to the graveyard to send a message
Lil' bitch just dine and dash, she ate my dick, couldn't stay for breakfast (Ugh)
I'm a human lie detector test, I can peep who really flexing

It's business, it's not personal, so don't get all emotional
If it ain't 'bout the money, what the fuck you in a business for? (What the fuck?)
Blood thicker than water, but it's business, it's not personal (Shit business)
And if you know like I know, you would never take shit personal (No)
It's business, it's not personal, so don't get all emotional (Huh?)
If it ain't 'bout the money, what the fuck you in a business for? (Yeah)
Blood thicker than water, but it's business, it's not personal (It's Gucci)
And if you know like I know, you would never take shit personal (It's bad, go)
You might also like
I don't know you personally, but get some business 'bout yourself (Go, go, go)
All that being a yes man and dick-ridin', that shit bad for your health
And when you stand on business, do it solo and please watch your step (Well, damn)
And please don't go on IG Live, self snitch, and incriminate yourself (Huh?)
Rap game like the WWL, this shit fake as fuck
Nigga say he gon' rob me, but he'd have better luck with an armored truck
The blogs keep bringing my name up in a negative way to frame it up (No)
I got friends and fam can't comprehend the way I leveled up (No)
Artists think we friends, we really ain't, we just business partners
Go off what you know, not what you think, mind your business, partner (Huh?)
I just put a Lambo' in each ear, I'm not talking Urus
You ain't worth a hundred million, dear, I can't take you serious (It's Gucci)
I'm at The Palms in the pent', spent 25K, I'm working on my J
Niggas really J's and they be gay, so I don't believe nothin' they say
Gucci, how long you been having your way? Since y'all swing my way
Tell the haters I said fuck 'em, go have a nice day, shooter got a Russian AK

It's business, it's not personal, so don't get all emotional
If it ain't 'bout the money, what the fuck you in a business for? (What the fuck?)
Blood thicker than water, but it's business, it's not personal (Shit business)
And if you know like I know, you would never take shit personal (No)
It's business, it's not personal, so don't get all emotional (Huh?)
If it ain't 'bout the money, what the fuck you in a business for? (Yeah)
Blood thicker than water, but it's business, it's not personal (It's Gucci)
And if you know like I know, you would never take shit personal (It's bad, go)Embed
