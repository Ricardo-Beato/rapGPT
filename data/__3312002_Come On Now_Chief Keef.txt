29 ContributorsCome On Now Lyrics
Parked the foreign in a handicap
Get a ticket, pay that shit
Spend that money, make that shit
I was in Broward county, late as shit
What's the tab, chains on, feel like fab
Make her feel this wrath, make her catch a cab
I'ma go my path, I'ma roll my half
I don't like to kick it, nigga come on now

I don't like to kick it, in my pockets bitches
I spin her no fidget, and my chips got ridges
Speedin' over bridges, need that crispy chicken
For my ugly days, I do pretty spendin'
For I don't feel like did Diddy gettin' kitty in your city
Foenem got my 50 if you got a problem with me
All this power feel like 50 you want me nigga come and get me
You can call me Sosa Cannon Lion got them drones with me
Filet mignon, cheese, nachos
I need combos, too much, I know
Hundreds, fifty's, give me, you hear me
You so silly, run up the milli's

Parked the foreign in a handicap
Get a ticket, pay that shit
Spend that money, make that shit
I was in Broward county, late as shit
What's the tab, chains on, feel like fab
Make her feel this wrath, make her catch a cab
I'ma go my path, I'ma roll my half
I don't like to kick it, nigga come on now
You might also like
Fucking with me, they gon' bring them hemis
Hollow tips, cracking all your chips
All my dogs fighting like I'm Michael Vick
Got a condo in Atlanta, where I fuck my bitch
Fuck my bitch, where I fuck your bitch
Thirty six diamonds shine like MJ's pants
And my gang be off the wall but I don't wear no vans
Ayy, get your mans 'fore I cut off his hands
I got hoes in every city, got a wool for every season
I leave all my bitches fiending, 'cause I leave that pussy leaking
Got a big Bentley and a G Wagon, fuck your Jeep
Bitch, I'm finally rich like that nigga Chief Keef

Parked the foreign in a handicap
Get a ticket, pay that shit
Spend that money, make that shit
I was in Broward county, late as shit
What's the tab, chains on, feel like fab
Make her feel this wrath, make her catch a cab
I'ma go my path, I'ma roll my half
I don't like to kick it, nigga come on now2Embed
