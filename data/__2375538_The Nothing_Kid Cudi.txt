28 ContributorsThe Nothing Lyrics
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Can someone, anyone give me candy?
Someone, anyone give me candy
Hmm

Mary, Mary, quite contrary
You aren't going to cut it
Scary, scary, growing weary
Chop, chop, chop it up, cut it
Eerie, eerie, darkness nearing
No one hears you suffer
Purely, purely, there's no curing
Chop, chop, chop it up and cut it

The nothing (Hmm, mm, mm-mm)
The nothing
Chasing something, don't know what
The nothing (Hmm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm)
The nothing (Hmm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm)

Moving, moving, darkness looming
Leave me sleepless, running
Scary, scary, growing weary
Chop, chop, chop it up, cut it
Clearly, clearly, don't come near me
Don't you see what's coming?
Fury, fury, there's no curing
Chop, chop, chop it up, cut it

The nothing (Hmm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm)
The nothing
I'll cut you now
Tu-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru, tu-ru-ru-ru
Fucking waste
But you can probably ass with some of couple pies baby
But you can come on down to save me, babe
If you wouldn't love me, you can ground me for
Give me 2Embed
