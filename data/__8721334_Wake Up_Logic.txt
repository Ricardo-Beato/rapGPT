Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up

Can't get enough, no, I can't get enough
Took another route, no, I never ended up in cuffs
Had a gat in my hand, but I didn't wanna be that man
Look in the mirror, couldn't see that man
Pick up the pen, never stick up to men
Only pick up the stick if I need to defend
If I did it back then, might've dropped dead
Know a nigga doin' life 'cause he a hothead
I took a ride through my city the other day
Wonder what would have happened if it all went the other way
Jump in the whip, now I reminisce
On the days when I was runnin' 'round the Ave
Could've never imagined the way that my life would have
Turned out and all of the things that I have
I ain't talkin' material, talkin' about my material
This shit that I'm writin', the shit that I been through
I went through the worst, but I made it out
Like the Alpha Omega, to show me which way it could go
Yeah, he laid it out
Instead of just sittin' on the beach
I'm reconnectin' with the streets
They wasn't payin' attention, I was prayin' for ascension
No need to mention my attention to detail
Homie, we will prevail
Lot of motherfuckers wanna wake up every day
Then they murder their own, but they know it's another way
Fuck all the violence and drugs in communities
This song right here is immunity
They call it the trap, 'cause they trapped
And just take our money, then they don't give it back to us
Black man can't even get himself a bachelor
Dropped out of school then he picked up a spatula
'Cause he never had a good role model, just a hood role model
Now I know that's the old model
We breakin' that cycle
I think I see the finish line
Got a vision now, don't diminish mine
Lot of brothers in the hood doin' good
And I know I see it all the time
But they only wanna push
All the drugs and all the crime on Channel 9
Fuck all that fallacy, this shit right here for my people
People that strugglin', people work hard as they can
But they still don't feel equal
Trust me, I know, I been there before
Trust me, I know, that feelin' don't ever go
You might also like
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up
Every day I wake up, every day I wake up

And on a beautiful Autumn day in 2011
Logic and his best friends drive through the slums of College Park in a Chevy Impala
Around the streets of Prince George's county
Cruising through an unknown universe
Beginning a journey that would inevitably alter the course
Of not only their own
But the lives of millions of people around the world1Embed
