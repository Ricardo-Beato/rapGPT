89 ContributorsNas Is Coming Lyrics

Motherfuckin' Dre! (Ahh)
Whassup, my nigga?!
Sup, Nas?
Chillin', God
Niggas is up in here hittin' some of this chronic, nigga
Yeah, and this chocolate over here, they mixed this shit up
Nigga, hit some of this shit, nigga
Yeah, lemme get that
I'm tired of these niggas, niggas stealin' beats
And niggas is stealin' your whole techniques and shit
Niggas wanna take everythin' from a nigga, man
Yeah, yeah, yo, Nas, it's like this, man
Niggas can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin'?
Just like niggas can't do what you do
Right, right
You know, can't nobody fuck with this
You know, all these niggas out here just
Talkin' this East Coast/West Coast bullshit
Niggas need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know?
Word
Fuck it
What is it, what is it, God?
Let's get together, make some fuckin' music
Right, that's what I'm sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
And get paid, and just, let that be it
Right, right
All these niggas talkin' all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens
You might also like
The Golden Child shot that ass up, you was holdin' out
Let the streets be the court, and corners hold the trial
Fatal, not fictitious, I rock the cable, '86 shit
Foreign cars, young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Solicitin' ill editions of that murder I wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on the top of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes
Chrome kitted up, calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched, checkin' my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutchin' gats, quick to bust
But knowin' how these niggas tattle
I sneak-move, get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run, the lead travels
I come through, it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the fam', crew
Firm affiliation, paper chasin'
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano, sophisticado
Blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be the real
But impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Countin' bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A 100G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout — murder material, serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's somethin' venereal
But back in stereo

Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile covers surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted
Control the rap game, you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way, the 'Bridge say, "Shake dice and kiss it"
Sip Cris', push the 6 with the biscuit
Jeep full of chickens — pull up beside, have a listen, y'all
"Nas, y'all" — fly gangsta, wavy hair, teeth chipped in
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk, links truck, rocky bracelet
Cognac kernel, never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro, diamond Role, hustlin' low
Pro-file white gold style, rakin' bloody doe by the pile
Shot down, still alive
He strugglin' for the phone, fo'-fo' blow him
When homicide comes, these three words are sung

Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming (Nasty Nas is coming)
Nas is coming

Check this out
It's Nasty Nas and Dr. Dre, haha
East meets West
That's how we makin' it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Ayo, Nas, let's get this money, let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfuckin' clowns out here
Riffin' and beefin' about this bullshit
Yo, haha, while they doin' all that
We just gon' kick back with these honeys, this Cristal
Haha, and party to the year 2G
Nas is coming (Haha, that’s right)
Nas is coming (That’s right)
Nas is coming (Ha, yeah, Nasty Nas)
Nas is coming (Dr. Dre, making it happen)21Embed
