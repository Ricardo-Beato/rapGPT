2 ContributorsBeyond Trayvon Lyrics
"A seventeen year-old boy, who had Skittles in his pocket, was shot and killed"
"I believe the cops are racist"
"I had no intention about fighting my way out..."

From the pages of the Cress Theory, I know you hear me
If you out there, listen up, yeah, I know you feel me
Do I look suspicious on this track, with the black
In it, black hoodie, consciousness, and black fact
Yo, a young kid was shot, is the cry we heard
Like Emmett Till, it was tears and hearts felt
No arrest warrant, no weapons found
One eyewitness, yeah, black body down
I can hear it now, it's the same old racist shit
"Thought he had a gun," that's the same old racist shit
Confessions of a trigger-happy hitman
Murderous, homicidal nature, the racist plan
Burying black boys, the bloodthirsty hunger games
The face of race is white, yeah, they got no shame
"Stand Your Ground," they legalize lynch laws
Touch another black kid, yeah, you touch us all

(Some of those children are small)
(Little kids hopin' up beyond sixteen)
Beyond Trayvon
He lives in a song
(Some of those children are small)
(Little kids hopin' up beyond sixteen)
Beyond Trayvon
He lives in a song
You might also like
I get feared looks, but I live 'round here
My house right next to yours, but I still get stares
In a world of wrongness and fights for the strongest
What's the innocent to do when the fight gets brought, kid?
No way you're that scared of my hoodie
People everywhere getting snared over hoodies
Seen a couple pairs get aired over hoodies
But they don't care, my skin's bared over hoodies

It's time to stand up and just fight for what you believe in
I don't call it violence, I just call it self-defense
Call it black intelligence brought to by the people
You just in it to get it, I'm in it to make a change
In it to change the game, in it to rearrange
Modern day lynching, all that leave us is pain
Knowledge is power, all I give you is brains, you see
It's money, power, respect; all seems the same, ah

(Some of those children are small)
(Little kids hopin' up beyond sixteen)
Beyond Trayvon
He lives in a song
(Some of those children are small)
(Little kids hopin' up beyond sixteen)
Beyond Trayvon
He lives in a song
This world is so chaotic, all I witness is violence
Watching my brothers die and their sons grow with no guidance
The truth's what I'm providing to all those who've been blinded
Being sold this equality bullshit I ain't buying
I'm so sick and tired of being profiled and instantly
Watched close suspiciously because of my ethnicity
Ya so stereotypical, it's despicable
And every black male in a hoodie isn't a criminal

This is everyday life where I'm from, it goes on
But I swear it cannot go beyond Trayvon
Because I'm wearing a hoodie
I gotta get shot or stopped by the cops
It's not just in Florida, it's out in Farrock
People really expect us to act civil? Right
We got a Black president and still fighting for civil rights
We need to come together and unite
Because it's time to fight the power
So put your fists up in the sky

(Some of those children are small)
(Little kids hopin' up beyond sixteen)
Beyond Trayvon
He lives in a song
(Some of those children are small)
(Little kids hopin' up beyond sixteen)
Beyond Trayvon
He lives in a song
Save our sons and daughters
Beyond Trayvon
Freed the ass, the mind followed
With raps that killed tomorrow
I can't support it, fought it
But somebody bought it, community caught it
Yeah, but yo government taught it
And all you heard of
Violence, hard drugs, sex, and murder songs
Never hated artists who kept making 'em
Strong against the wrong, what's been created
But look, many neighborhoods are still devastated
I say it flow's overrated, shows underrated
I hate it when it's degraded and downgraded
Spittin' copywritten to music
Some of y'all grew up to use it
People don't dance to it and just abuse it
Y'all say that when I say this
Injustice still goes on, beyond Trayvon
Thank you NME Sun for this word to the young
You the future, save our daughters and sons

(Some of those children are small)
(Little kids hopin' up beyond sixteen)
Beyond Trayvon
He lives in a song
(Some of those children are small)
(Little kids hopin' up beyond sixteen)
Beyond Trayvon
He lives in a song

We are now the most degraded people on this planet...Embed
