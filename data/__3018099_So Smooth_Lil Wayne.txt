Take a look at a playa ma, I'm so smooth
I don't mean to brag but baby girl I'm that dude
The ladies say that Boo so handsome
And they like how I be styling in them (?)
Now let me see you dance til' your feet hurt
All I wanna see is G-strings no cheap skirts
I got hundreds to spend, bottles to pop
Put it on me slow girl and make that ass drop, drop
You know how Young Money do it
Trap stars with the dough, mami we be running through it
Now Weezy got my dough bigger
If your woman in the club then homeboy you better get her
Cause I'll take her in a minute Imma dog her when I finish
Homie I'm a problem and a menace
I'm like Diddy cause I'm all about my Benjis
If I get into the crib she comin faster than a henny

It's the Hot Spitta nigga
It's the Hot Spitta nigga
It's the Hot Spitta nigga and I'm bout it
And if you know another nigga you thinks fuckin with the youngin
Bring him round me if you want and Imma down 'em
Yea I still got that Montecarlo and it's painted candy green
She recognize a nigga when I pull up on the scene
Bitches say that nigga fly, bitches say that nigga cute
But don't ever get it twisted you all know what I would do
You can ask them niggas bout me say I'm cooler than a fan
But I keep that heater on me like a fucking tool man
I jack 'em out they bitches cause I got that killa game
And yo bring a couple bitches for me and my nigga Mane
You might also like
I'm loaded she rolling so we rolling
To a place these niggas'll never get
Cold flow Mane I'm the shit
My hoes is like slaves nigga I got 'em all whipped
I got 'em all whips said they all got tints
My flat chested hoes man I bought 'em all tits
I love all my juvies I bought 'em all fits
And all my old hoes they be steady catching fits
My college chicks keep asking a nigga bout college
Like (?) that bitch and wouldn't survive it
Mother fuck knowledge
No need for a Bachelors, Young Mane
Streets got the streets mastered
PHD, no excuse me my CFD
Thats my Certified Fly Degree
They be looking at your boy like how fly is he?
Next time start tellin 'em I'm fly as a pelican

Gee little girl whats your name who you be with?
You prolly never been with a Hollygrove G
I'm 5 foot 6 I'm fly as fuck
And I drank a lot and get high enough
Like I'm looking real hot and your girl okay
Wanna (?)
And I tell her come through like every day
She'll literally do everything I say
Ahh, what you know about them Young Money G's
Come through this bitch sitting tall on trees
I met your boyfriend now you sitting on me
I prolly be the dog but all y'all hoes flees
She say she never seen Air Forces that clean
I know my shits look like Porcelain gleam
Louis Vuitton or Louis the 13
She like "ooh he remind me of a wet dream"
She wanna, throw it back now
So throw it back
Even though my pops died he taught me how to blow them backs out
Now show that tat ma, now show that crack ma
Cause I'm a crack head, I need that crack house
Come to a nigga house and get that ass out
We all boning, no we dont bad mouth
Come to the back room, then hit the back floor
Then hit the back door, now holla back ho!
I got 'em
Okay now wobble di wobble di hoe
Wobble di wobble hoe
Wobble di wobble hoe
Wobble di wobble hoe
Wobble di wobble hoe
Wobble di wobble hoe
Wobble di wobble hoe
Wobble di wobble
Wobble di
I said hey pretty girl I'm feelin' yo frame
Show that tattoo girl what that nigga name?
Aye pretty girl I'm feelin' yo frame
Show that tattoo I bet he ain't Lil WayneEmbed
