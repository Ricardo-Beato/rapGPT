10 ContributorsPressure Lyrics
I know no no
I don't know no no
I don't know no no

Now let me tell you bout this rap nigga who would never blow
He got all the fucking talent, yeah the kid is hella dope
Couldn't see through all phonies, should've bought a telescope
He was aiming too high so he had to settle low
Shopping label after label, never signed him a deal
And you know I'm so retarded, couldn't find the appeal
Didn't matter 'bout the work or how he rhyming with skills
Just another young nigga tryna grind for the bills
I mean I never was too tall or skilled to go shoot ball
I know I'ma move far, but dammit it's too hard
Imagined if you starved, but dreaming of shoes, cars
And everyone around you is just wishing that you'd fall
But nah I refuse
See a nigga came to carry a mission
People all from different places come with varied intentions
I'm a great and I knew that from the very beginning
But barely ambitious, not to mention the Larry I'm piffin
Ain't no friends, people wanna see you buried in prison
Me and all these others rappers, man it's scary the difference
I'm too ahead
Plus I always kill tracks and I shoot 'em dead
The difference is blue and red and I never salute the Feds
'Cause the systems so corrupted, they just after the loot and bread
I rather just lose my head, think what pastor would do instead
My guidance when I'm arriving, through all of the flashing lights and
Love for the passion writing, but dying a crashing Viking
But yeah
You might also like
They never love you for real
They never love you for real
Keep it subtle and chill
On my way to top about the bundles and mills
Oh, what a wonderful feeling
It's such a wonderful feeling
They never love you for real
Keep it subtle and chill
On my way to top about the bundles and mills

I'm thinking back to into a time before my life was obscene
At times I be the only enemy just fighting my dreams
This rap shit is whole my life, it's like a pipe to a fiend
Or better yet, no metaphor, it's like a mic to a me
I reminisce my childhood and I ride my bike in the street
And we go straight to Marcus house he get to slicing a beat
And we was in school till 2, but shit, was writing by 3
But that was back when it was fun, it was enticing at least
And then I almost lost it all, used to cry in my sleep
And lay awake and always pray something the righteous could beat
Take me back to the days when I used to work at the mall
Take me back to the days when I wasn't perfect at all
And when you climbing from the bottom, it never hurts when you fall
Got some problems I been hiding but I'm working to solve
Don't let me blow and realize it wasn't worth the recall
I lay a verse and into the earth, pop a perk till I'm off2Embed
