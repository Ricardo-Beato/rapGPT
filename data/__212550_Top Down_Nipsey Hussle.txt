10 ContributorsTop Down Lyrics
Yuh, Nip Hussle in this motherfucker
Rallo, what up?
Look

My top down, your name hot now
But when I was out here, nigga, you was not 'round ('Round)
Was in the game, but I just watch now
I did rims so my shit stock now (Ayy)
Suede, hit, linin' on the roof
Don't be lyin' on the facts, niggas lyin' in the booth
When we travel around the world, we flyin with a suitcase Stamped Louis Vuitton with Cuban cigar
Miami, Ocean Ave, couple beautiful broads
On the back of motorbikes, ain't no use for a car
I'm outta town, so the coupe is at large
And this, jealous of success, niggas usually are
But, I dont give a fuck, I ain't trippin' though
Nigga gettin' desperate while I'm gettin' dough
Oh, you love that bitch? Better get ya hoe
And I ain't gotta tell you why, you already know

One-One-Once in a lifetime shit
She ain't never been fucked in a drop top Benz
That's why when I pull up, she quick to get in
I'm a boss, young nigga, get some paper and a pen
Class is in session, rap 'til I'm restless
'Cause constant repetition is the path to progression
Class is in session, rap 'til I'm restless
'Cause constant repetition is the path to progression
You might also like
Take that and run with it, you should get some cash (Cash)
Way back as young niggas, we was livin' fast
Heavy on the grind, South Central State of mind
Type of nigga buy a pound, break it all down in dimes
Baby blue regal, 1985
Gold Rollie on my neck, 380 in my spine
It was a lot of things that was runnin' through my mind
All of which I would bring to myself, in due time
And now I'm watchin' ring put a strain on her eye
Fireworks in my sleeve, the 4th of July
Waist line Louis, stay fly truly
Can't fuck with me with a rubber or a roofie
Hoes try to choose me, haters try and shoot me
Feds wanna book me and these bitches wanna screw me
Ex-street nigga turned boss, that's the routine
And you would have extras if your life was a movie

Yuh (Yuh, yuh, yuh)
Catch my breath, that's a whole lot of words, you know
This is the marathon
New shit, Neighborhood Nip Hussle, let's get itEmbed
