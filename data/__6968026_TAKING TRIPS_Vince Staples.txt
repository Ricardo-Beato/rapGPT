Listen (Listen), I ain't going (Nah), riding foreign
Riches off of tourin' (Yeah), call-ignoring
Missions, miss my brothers (Yeah), die for colors (Miss my, miss my)
Quidditch, catching snitches (Snitch), do him vicious
Living, like Khadijah, quick to leave her (I ain't never really know the bitch, man)
Just because, like Anita (Baker), she in love
But it's leisure (Nah, no), real around-the-corner bleeder (Yeah, Norfside)
Bounce out on 'em on Artesia, now we got amnesia (Yeah, likе, "Where you from, cuz?")
