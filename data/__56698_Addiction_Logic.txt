44 ContributorsAddiction Lyrics
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough

Knockin'- knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin'- knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
I'ma- I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin'- knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin'- knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
I'ma- I'ma come through and show my wood pine

Boy, I know my shit was on another level
When people would joke around and say I signed with the devil
'Cause it's gotta be a sin to be this good
Hating on my music shit I wish you would (I wish you would)
Yeah I been offered four of five deals
Bust like banana clips, boy that's four or five kills
Doing the most accumulating so much bread
I think it's time for toast and I ain't talking fine wine
I'm talking semi-automatic shit that blow your mind
Then when I blow like mine the whole world gon' see me shine
This is the life that I should live homie
I'm never going back, I'm addicted to the game
Y'all can tell by the tracks
You might also like
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough

I'm addicted to the game, addicted to the pain
Of sacrificing matters of the heart just to obtain
Living a life that most won't attain
And I know it is essential
But when it comes to love, man, that shit is subsequential
For now I just be chillin' with ballers
Poppinâ€™ collars, pushing Impalas, cutting records and counting dollars
I'm addicted, my lines is cocaine
And when they disperse blow minds like propane
And you know these haters that never made it this mad
Cause they never had what we had
Addicted to the game and I'm glad
On my Amy Winehouse, I'm saying fuck Rehab
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
Knockin', knockin' doors down, showing cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough13Embed
