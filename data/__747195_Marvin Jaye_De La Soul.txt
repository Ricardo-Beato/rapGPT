4 ContributorsMarvin Jaye Lyrics
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to heal me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
Get up, get up, get up, get up - let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up - 'cos you do it right

Greetings girl welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
Daisy Age, you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
And I know you already know the name cause, uh
My name's Plug One
Don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
Cause they've already been squooshed
We're gonna get (sexual)
Yea, sexual, right behind a bush
Now stay with me, well Eye Know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
But regardless of the fact that I'm Plug One baby
I'mma love you til the sun baby
You might also like
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby, oh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Come take control, just grab a hold
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Oh, oh, just grab a hold
Oh, oh, come take control
Oh, I can't hold it much longer
Come take control, just grab a hold
Come take, just grabEmbed
