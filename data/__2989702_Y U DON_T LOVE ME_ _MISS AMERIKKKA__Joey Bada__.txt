83 ContributorsY U DON’T LOVE ME? (MISS AMERIKKKA) Lyrics
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Ayy
Oh, oh

Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

Why you can't recognize my stride?
Always gotta minimize my pride
Always gon' criticize my moods
I can't make one mistake, it's no room
Feelin' like I gotta leave real soon
I'ma say, "Namaste," and just bloom
But for now, let you run away from the truths
Since you can do anything you want to, anyway, uh
Know some things I ain't supposed to know
It's way deeper than just bein' emotional
Some things you just couldn't keep on the low
Now I'm free, by the truth, I can't be controlled, no more
Nothin' like I used to be back before
Know it must hurt for you to see me evolve
Why you gotta kick me down on all fours?
Why you can't stand to see me stand tall?
Tell me why we got a war?
Why we gotta fight? Why we always gotta spar for?
Why the cops always gotta get called?
Why you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?
I guess some things will never change
Locked in the cycle, tryna break the chains
Handcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins
This what tough love feels like, feel my pain, uh
You might also like
Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

Because Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
Because Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
Okay, okay you red, white and blue
Now you no good Miss America
How you like this shit, huh?5Embed
