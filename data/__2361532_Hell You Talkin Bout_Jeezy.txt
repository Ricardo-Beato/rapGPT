15 ContributorsHell You Talkin Bout Lyrics
On ten never four hell you talkin' 'bout
See my niggas gone go hell you talkin' bout
Fuck them rich niggas round your way hell you talkin' 'bout
(We got London On Da Track)
Still letting that chopper spray hell you talkin' 'bout
Yea we bout to celebrate hell you talkin' 'bout
Fuck em let em hate hell you talkin' 'bout
Homie ain’t no other way hell you talkin' 'bout
What we do this everyday Hell you talkin' 'bout

Thought I just seen Jizzle wit 100 gang bangers
100 dope boys, that’s 100 chains dangling
Real niggas to the front bitch niggas to the rear
Snuck it in wit me barrel like a bottle Belvedere
Screamin thug life nigga rich nigga thugged out
I will show nosey ass nigga what these slugs bout
Ain't no playin pussy nigga yea you know my reputation
Ain't wit no playing pussy nigga so won't be no hesitation
They hate it when I’m walkin' in I’m getting all that love
They keep callin' my name like I own this club
Ain't gotta ask the valet cause you know who's in it
And my shit in my name so you know who's rented
Now how can one man have all that power
Now how can one man talk all that powder
Why you keep talkin' yola cause I really cooked that
I just came to give the bad bitches something to look at
You might also like
On ten never four hell you talkin' 'bout
See my niggas gone go hell you talkin' bout
Fuck them rich niggas round your way hell you talkin' 'bout
Still letting that chopper spray hell you talkin' 'bout
Yea we bout to celebrate hell you talkin' 'bout
Fuck em let em hate hell you talkin' 'bout
Homie ain’t no other way hell you talkin' 'bout
What we do this everyday Hell you talkin' 'bout

Yo what's wrong with the bitch, boy she know she look good
She don’t want you nigga she like hers a 'lil hood
Told her pull up to the spot baby bring your mouth too
Got that condo pussy might just have to house you
Something wrong with your wrist boy ya watch game off
You niggas ain't poppin' boy, ya pop game off
And fuck how her pussy feel yea that still my attitude
And boy them clips so long we just call em latitude
When I talk that shit them dope boys go crazy
One thing you never seen a dope boy that lazy
Catch me on my Denzell tryna get my Frank on
And don’t be talkin' me to death I'm tryna get my drank on ayyyyye!

On ten never four hell you talkin' 'bout
See my niggas gone go hell you talkin' bout
Fuck them rich niggas round your way hell you talkin' 'bout
Still letting that chopper spray hell you talkin' 'bout
Yea we bout to celebrate hell you talkin' 'bout
Fuck em let em hate hell you talkin' 'bout
Homie ain’t no other way hell you talkin' 'bout
What we do this everyday Hell you talkin' 'bout4Embed
