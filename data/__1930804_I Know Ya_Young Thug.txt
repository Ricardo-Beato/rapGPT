8 ContributorsI Know Ya Lyrics
(Life, woah) I know you baby (Haha Woah)
I can't wait to show you baby
(Thugga Thugga, baby)
Baby, listen (Wooo)

I know you baby (And what)
Caught you walkin' through the club, yeah I owe you baby (Club)
Make my niggas throw some ones just to show you baby (Throw that cash)
Geeked up right now and I can change your life (Yeah, cut it out)
Just one night, I can change your life (Cut it out)
Just one try, I can change your life (Cut it out)
And one night, I can change your life (Cut it out)
(Change your life right now)

Why you ain't rock the school boys when you need em
Body tatted like a race car, speed 'em
Baby wet the car after ya girl peed 'em
Thugger hungry for the rapper, please feed him
Haha, feed me, feed me
Fuck ridin' with Keisha, I got birds, I'm with KeKe
By the way, your old lady sneaky
You're not my blood, I just call you Cici (I'm not playin right now)
Do you get it? (Nah)
I'm hot, my first name, last name is Thugger Skillet (And what?)
I love to spend the night, she gave me her birth certificate
 a lil paper but it's lookin' like a midget
Racks

I know you baby (And what?)
Caught you walkin' through the club, yeah I owe you baby (Club)
Make my niggas throw some ones just to show you baby (Throw that cash)
Geeked up right now and I can change your life (Yeah, cut it out)
Just one night, I can change your life (Cut it out)
Just one try, I can change your life (Cut it out)
And one night, I can change your life (Cut it out)
(Change your life right now)

I can change your life
Pick up the dice, catch a point, do it twice
Damn right, that's a fifty-fifty chance
You got to, I done took penitentiary chances
Sayin' I want you to, bounce that ass
Show me you want that cash, be a big mouth 
Show me them other girls really mad
But slow it down some 'fore you get slim-fast
They playin' in a minor league
My whole team eatin' good, we the fiber league (We eatin')
You might catch us in the club throwin' that dynasty
Or no shirts, ridin' Jeeps like a Cherokee (We the No Shirt Gang)

I know you baby (And what?)
Caught you walkin' through the club, yeah I owe you baby (Club)
Make my niggas throw some ones just to show you baby (Throw that cash)
Geeked up right now and I can change your life (Yeah, cut it out)
Just one night, I can change your life (Cut it out)
Just one try, I can change your life (Cut it out)
And one night, I can change your life (Cut it out)
(Change your life right now)
Change your life right now
I will change your life right now (I swear to god I will)
Let me change your life right now (I swear to god I will)
Your life (Give it all up, for real though)
Your life (But you gotta be real though)
Your life (And you gotta be  though)
I'll change your life (You gotta be ready to kill though)
I'll change your life, your life, your life (Haha)
