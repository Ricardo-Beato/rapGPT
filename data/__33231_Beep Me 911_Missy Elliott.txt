Uh

Like that, uh
Uh
Say what, say what
Say what, say what
Uh

Uh
Say what, say what
Uh
Missy, bring it in

Why you played on me? Wasn't I good enough for you? (Wasn't good enough)
All those other girls you've been with can't do like I do (Do, do)
Gave you all my dough when you needed it all the time (Uh-huh)
And if you planning on leaving me again, then give me a sign (Say what, say what)

Beep me, 9-1-1, or call me on my cell phone (Uh)
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me (Say what, say what)
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits
It's over, babe
(Say what, say what, say what, say what)
Beep me, 9-1-1, or call me on my cell phone (Uh)
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me (Say what, say what)
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits
It's over babe (Uh)
You might also like
Why you cheating on me? Can you tell me what I've done?
I thought you was the one, but you just a hit and run
Gave up clubs and parties, I put them aside (I stopped goin' to all the parties)
Left me in the dark with no kind of sign
(Why don't you give me a sign?)

Beep me, 9-1-1, or call me on my cell phone (Beep me, call me)
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me (Even though you don't want to)
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits
It's over babe
(No thinking twice) (Say what, say what)
Beep me, 9-1-1, or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me (Call ya right back, yeah)
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits
It's over babe

All my friends say I can do better than you (Say what, say what)
Maybe they was right 'cause I feel like a fool (Fool, fool)
But I can't let you go until you take some time (Say what, say what)
To tell me why you left me without a goddamn sign (Say what, say what)
Beep me, 9-1-1, or call me on my cell phone (Beep me, orâ€”)
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me (Or at least give me a call)
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits
It's over babe (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Beep me, 9-1-1, or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me (See, I still want you to call me)
You don't wanna date (No, no)
No ifs, ands, or waits (No waits, no waits)
It's over babe (It's over)
(Magoo, Magoo)

Type of nigga made built to last
Look homegirl, I pump like gas when
Get your friend and your girl and them (What?)
My sex drive workout like a gym, Kim (What?)
Was the girl that I used to hit
You the girl that I gotta quit
See the kitty Kit
Gotta gold it like a light
In the night, you the freak come out
We don't bite
No diggity, who took you out?
No doubt when I first got down
Made the bro shout
Look out, make it live
Dip and dive, staying alive
Shoot me sugar, there it is
Now we talking square biz
I'm leaving you without arrears
But I still love the kids
What you think? I'm henpecked
Girl, get your mind checked
Take the time, recollect
I just gave you disrespect
Ah, like that
Like that
Beep me 9-1-1, baby
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Say what, say what
Misdemeanor, 702
What y'all gon' do?
Fellas?
Don't beep them 9-1-1
Don't beep them 9-1-1
Don't beep them 9-1-12Embed
