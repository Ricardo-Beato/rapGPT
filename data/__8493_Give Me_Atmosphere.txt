Jimmy got shot in the parking lot...

I'm a slow typer, a so-so writer
Been the shit ever since I was an infant in diapers
And I'ma be dope, all the way to the end
From the cradle to the grave, the Pampers to the Depends
Get enough love, got enough friends
But on a regular basis, it's safe to say I've got the bends
And I didn't mean to ignore that vibe you sent
I guess my mind was probably on my rent
Oh I got my mind on my tummy, and my tummy on my mind
Some assembly required, let me run it down the line
The factory is open, time card punched
Until lunch time, it's crunch time, back to work
Fool, the first rule is to keep the verse true
Even if it hurts you, you gotta wear the pain like a stain
Respect the listener, respect the game
Because there's more to game than some dinner and fame

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug
And I'ma play this game, I just wanna say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'ma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll
You might also like
See I'm that cat that used to sit in the back and study
Looking for some proof, that God loves ugly
Flash forward a decade later in your town
Somehow, a good number of ya'll got down
And it's solid, fresh, dope, whatever you wanna call it
Not bad for an aspiring sociopathic alcoholic
(Ahh shit) Look at Slug still rockin' the same outfit
Tryin to make the belly grow bigger than the wallet
Ay yo man, how you doing, (what?), how you been?
Just been makin' it cool to rap about love again
Not that hippie stuff, I'm talkin' 'bout that bitch that gets you nuts
Did he say bitch? Yeah I'm sorry, don't tell my baby's mommy
Speakin' of baby, when done, there'll be a crate full of albums
For my son to page through, thinking daddy was a gun
With a handful of heads that put me up
Til they had some samples from Ant, and faith in What the Fuck?
I said, still goin', still maintainin'
Still standing in the land of snow and purple rain
And I'm still waitin for my date to kiss me or slap me
Cause there ain't no way that I can be happy, when I'm happy

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug
And I'ma play this game, I just wanna say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'ma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll
I've had the pleasure of speaking with some of you
Yeah you, come on now, don't act like you don't know who I'm talking to
After that show, when you approached me like you know me
The CD I sold you, the secrets that you told me
On that world you vision, through the layers of tears
The ones you choke and keep hidden when the players are near
I watch you chase it with beer, some frustration and fear
Try to figure out why the hell I came here
Well I don't know either, and I'm not ready to take a breather, neither
All I know is I'm still a believer
So you can beat me up, or you can beat me off
Pick a side, any side, and let me do my job, come on
If you've got a lot of love to give, but you don't know who to give it to
I'ma turn out the lights of the cigarette, and write a song about you
This one's for you

Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug
And I'ma play this game, I just wanna say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'ma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll
But don't you dare stop there
That's the tool, and I play it cool
I've seen things, that used to be dreams
The name's Slug girl, give me a hug
What does ugly mean?7Embed
