4 ContributorsDon’t Slip Lyrics
Nigga stay fit, don't come on my street
The bitch know Keef got some on his feet
I'm lookin at my son and he grew a couple feet
Know I be with my boys and ain't talkin back street
If you tryna front pull up on back street
I know I got money don't be tryna tax me
If you on some business, nigga you can fax me
She like when I get the top gone like last week
It's 52 degrees and I'm wearing a hoodie
Chief so what’s that I smell that good kushy
I heard you with the police force and you a rookie
I'm walkin around this bitch like a liquor tootsie
I heard you ain't tryna fuck her but you eat the pussy
Ain't ain't even wanna fuck that bitch she look weak
Told my brother bring me back some clothes from japenese
I might be wit a chinese but bitch I’m Capanese
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, I got a tiger by its feet
King of the Jungle, watching out for rivalries
Looked up my shoes and they say made in Italy
Went and bought a mop oh yeah I named it slippery
Aye, don't slip nigga, don't slip nigga, don't slip nigga
My shoes tied, I don't trip nigga
And if I'm in the club I'm in the VIP nigga
Light you up LED strip nigga
Act like you got it locked you get zipped nigga
And I'm real fuckin cool, I got the whips nigga
Nigga get off yo block and take a trip nigga
Nigga get off yo block and take a trip niggaYou might also like2Embed
