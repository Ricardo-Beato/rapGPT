8 ContributorsRespect It or Check It Lyrics
Some niggas just wanna smoke
Some niggas wanna smoke niggas
Some niggas sell coke
Some niggas selling dope, nigga
We all hood, different pedigrees
Now ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check out my melody
You fuck around I catch a felony
Now ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check out my melody

Since a little nigga I been on my own, me I hold the chrome
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga
That shorty shit is over now I'm grown, me I'm full blown
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga

I don't know if I'm worse when I'm rich or when I'm broke, nigga
Same attitude, you got it, go 'head smoke, nigga
I'm fucking with a blonde bitch, I got my own fragrance
Powered by 50, goddamn it, I think I made it
I tried to keep it basic, they wanna complicate shit
The feds on my phone, that's why I don't ever say shit
Portray being a friend to me and I'll make you a memory
That .40 Cali barrel get to smoking like a chimney
Niggas sick of pussy shit and me I'm just the remedy
'03 get rich, nigga, you remember me?
Shorty rock her hips she get to looking like an entree
Bad bitch, fat ass, bouncing it like Beyonc√©
She saying "I'm a-a diva, I'm a, I'm a-a diva"
I'ma fuck her and leave her, nigga, I don't need her
I was born alone, I die alone, I be in the zone
Bitches won't leave me alone now that my money long
You might also like
Since a little nigga I been on my own, me I hold the chrome
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga
That shorty shit is over now I'm grown, me I'm full blown
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga
Since a little nigga I been on my own, me I hold the chrome
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga
That shorty shit is over now I'm grown, me I'm full blown
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga

I pull the hammer out and spank niggas
I peep your style, you got sugar in your tank, nigga
Don't fucking wink at me
I blend in with the best of them, shooters and robbers
I'm on that will.i.am shit, I black your eye for blogging
What the fuck is the problem? Violence isn't the answer
I split your fucking head then get jammed up
Why did you call the cops? Why didn't you say I'm hot?
It's been six years I been here on top
You act like I'm a average nigga spitting a average flow
Fucking with average bitches like everywhere that I go
I'm not focused on hoes, I'm focusing on the dough
And I won't talk to you after my next album blow

Since a little nigga I been on my own, me I hold the chrome
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga
That shorty shit is over now I'm grown, me I'm full blown
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga
Since a little nigga I been on my own, me I hold the chrome
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga
That shorty shit is over now I'm grown, me I'm full blown
You don't think so respect it or check it, nigga
Rest in peace to Michael Jackson
You niggas need me, man
I might have to start moonwalking
Couple dance moves and shit
Write me some shit, call it ''Billie Jean Is My Lover''
I'm back, nigga, why so quiet?
Niggas know it's summertime, I'm all over the place, nigga
And you know when you see me I'm strizzapped
Oh shit, nigga, y'all know I was gonna get on that shit, yeahEmbed
