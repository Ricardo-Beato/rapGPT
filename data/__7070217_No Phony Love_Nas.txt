29 ContributorsNo Phony Love Lyrics
If only I knew back then what I know today
She'd have never gone away
If only I wouldn't be so loving
I wouldn't be lonely
If only I'd take the time to show how much I care
I wouldn't be so lonely (I wouldn't be lonely)
Too many moments

Thoughts in the Cullinan
Too many moments when I thought I’d never love again
Scarred like a buck fifty, Birdie in Above the Rim
With you, I kept it on some humble shit
Damn, I guess you haven't noticed how I always been devoted
Even when you disrobin', late nights still get the coldest
Interviews, I been misquoted
But you bein' bad is just a bonus, look how beautiful your soul is
This shit feels like a high school crush (Think we in love)
I used to be her high school crush
She woke up in a fuss and asked me why did I hide her toothbrush
If I was honest, it'd be too much
Quiet storm on the radio puttin' me in the zone
I got questions in my text, "When am I comin' home?"
You laid up in my Supreme tee, you love my Tuscan cologne
I be excited to see you like I just didn't leave you (Ooh-wee, yeah)
I be excited to see you like I just didn’t leave you (Oh yeah)
You might also like
No phony love, if only love
Guaranteed trust, just to sum it up
You know what’s up (Know what's up) It's only us (Ooh-wee)
It’s only us (Ooh) it’s only us

She want me very exclusive (Yeah)
Relationships bound to fail when you barely into it
Stupid of me, continuously, I leave it in ruins
You perfect but I might just be married to music (For real)
Life is not what you harp on or what you go through
She boppin' her shoulders like the darkest one in Total (Go boo)
Women with good energy, the ones I'm close to (Uh)
And I already rolled two waiting for you to roll through (Pull up)
She lookin' at me like you need a queen in your life (Yeah)
You can't be single for life (Word), she tried to read me my rights
I’m hungover from last night, pour me some Pedialyte
We was just doin' so well, how was we in a fight? (Nah)
I just want somebody who real
Late-night, play D'Angelo, How Does It Feel (Facts)
You lookin’ for security I want someone secure
Let’s drop thirty at Louis and have sex in the store
Behind the curtain in the dressing room, you ain’t about that life, haha
I be excited to see you like I just didn’t leave you (Word)
No phony love, if only love
Guaranteed trust, just to sum it up
You know what’s up (Know what's up) It's only us (Ooh-wee)
It’s only us (Ooh) it’s only us
No phony love (No phony love) If only love (If only love)
Guaranteed trust (Guaranteed trust) Just to sum it up
You know what’s up (Love) it’s only us
It’s only us, it’s only us

You know us Virgos
All picky, in our heads and stuff
Love is trust
Trust is love, trust is love
Love is trust5Embed
