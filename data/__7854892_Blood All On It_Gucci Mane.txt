(Let the BandPlay)
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Okay, ayy

Cash out if I want it (For real, though)
The money got blood all on it (For real, though)
The money got blood all on it, yeah
The money got blood all on it (For real, though)
Bad bitch with me on it (For real, though)
Nigga wanna be me, don't it? (Gabbana)
But the money got blood all on it
Yeah, the money got blood all on it (Hey)
My young niggas ready to shoot (Damn)
'Cause they ain't got nothin' to lose (Damn)
He said, it's fuck everybody and fuck everything, he got somethin' to prove (Damn)
In the trenches pullin' moves (Got 'еm)
A hundred racks in blues (Franks)
In a shoebox, hеll nah, them ain't no motherfuckin' shoes (Racks, ayy, what you do, nigga?)

Took the motor out a 'Vette, put it in a Chevelle (Switch it up)
Do my dirt all by myself 'cause these niggas gon' tell (I swear)
She look like God sent her from Heaven, but she fine as hell (Bad)
I'm sendin' strong to five states, man, I just broke my scale (Uh)
Lil' cuz just caught a murder charge and I just post his bail (Yeah)
Doing donuts in a 'Rari, I'm a major player (Skrrt)
Send bags to the hood and to the opps I send some shells (Yeah)
Never talk on a phone and never leave a paper trail
Super bad bitch with a body like Buffy (Woah)
Went to see my jeweler, spent a million like it's nothin' (A millio')
I got on too much ice, she caught the flu when she fuck me (Uh)
Plain jane Richard Mille, I told my jeweler, "Bust it"

In a shoebox, hell nah, them ain't no motherfuckin' shoes (Racks)

At the top where it get real lonely
Just might put a dub on homie
New Phantom with the Forgis on it (Forgis)
And the paint got blood all on it (Yeah)
These niggas ain't eatin', they starvin' (Nah)
I can see 'cause they crew gettin' boney
These suckers do nothing but clout chase
These boys just some one-trick ponies (Pussies)
Man, this rap game so damn phony
These niggas a bunch of Jabronies (Hoes)
Everything you got, they want it
That's why I'm still up on it
Just told my hitter, he on it
Nigga better break fast like Shoney's
And I got my bag like Tony
These niggas wanna clone me, don't it? (Huh)
I went from ridin' a V12, switched it up and now my motor electric (Switched it up)
I stacked up way more millions than haters expected
You gotta shoot for your respect, that's how you send a message (Bah, baow)
You gotta do what you gotta do to keep family protected (It's Gucci)
Cash out when I want it, yeah (Huh)
These bitches know how I'm comin', yeah
These niggas know how I'm comin', yeah (Yeah)
The bitches know how I'm comin' (Yeah, why they call you Tony?)
'Cause I pop shit by my lonely (Fah)
Pocket full of Crip-blue hunnids, yeah
Money got blood all on it (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, I'm the one, not the two (Two), I turn a one to a two (Two)
I'm havin' racks, yeah, I got the bag, yeah, I put the bag on you, you
I put the bag on you too, inside my Hellcat ragù
I'm goin' nuts, I keep me a tool (Yeah), they like this young nigga a loose screw (Loco)
Yeah, took the doors off my McLaren, put it on my Urus, ayy (Phew, phew)
Don't compare me to no rapper 'cause these niggas weird, ayy
They done pissed me off, it's codeine all up in my urine, ayy (Wock', Wock')
When it come to shootin' shit, my jumper be the purest

Cash out if I want it (Bitch, for real, though)
The money got blood all on it (Yeah, for real, though)
The money got blood all on it, yeah (Yeah)
The money got blood all on it (For real, though, yeah)
Bad bitch with me on it (For real, though)
Nigga wanna be me, don't it? (Gabbana, ha)
But the money got blood all on it
Yeah, the money got blood all on it (Yeah, yeah, hey)
My young niggas ready to shoot (Damn)
'Cause they ain't got nothin' to lose (Damn)
He said, it's fuck everybody and fuck everything, he got somethin' to prove (Damn)
In the trenches pullin' moves (Got 'em)
A hundred racks in blues (Franks)
In a shoebox, hell nah, them ain't no motherfuckin' shoes (Racks)1Embed
