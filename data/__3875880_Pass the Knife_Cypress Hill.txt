Pass the knife, I'ma take a life
Seems I'm on a bad one, every night
More attention to the light
Burning up at the very touch, runaway train
I perform the ritual, take away all the pain
Free you from this life, from my hands I release you
If the end is what you pray for more than women to appease you
Another chapter starts and more darkness fills the ages
And another stage is set for many names upon the pages
I can sing you all the lullaby and nullify the threat to me
Then disappear, no one knows my whereabouts, presently
Blend in with the masses, now I'm fittin' in society
Hide behind the mask, overwhelmed by the anxiety
You might also like
In the middle of the street and I got me a pistol
If you wanna see more, all I gotta do is whistle
Ah shit, now you looking at a bloodbath
But queued motherfuckers is the one who had to have that

Hit the floor, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better, better hit the floor when you hear the sound
Better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better hit the floor when you hear the sound

Rolling stone
Everywhere I roam, I can call it home
I've adapted to the elements and set the tone
Set the bar high, stars in your eyes
Far as I can see, I can see those little scars that you hide
You one of the rock gods
This is only the beginning
'Cause the ghost is in the shadow
And this patience slowly thinnin'
Sweat drippin' down my face
As I'm waitin' for the moment
When the metal's flyin' blind
There's no chances for atonement
It's my life and I own it
Ace up me sleeve and I've shown it
I have skill to survive
All my life I have known it
I'm the one you should look to
If your enemy shook you
I have the skill if you need it
My name, don't even repeat it
In the middle of the street, and I got me a pistol
If you wanna see more all I gotta do is whistle
Ah shit, now you looking at a bloodbath
But queued motherfuckers is the one who had to have that

Hit the floor, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better, better hit the floor, better hit the floor
Better hit the floor when you hear the soundEmbed
