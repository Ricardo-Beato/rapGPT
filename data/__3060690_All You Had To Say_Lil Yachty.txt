38 ContributorsAll You Had To Say Lyrics
I done lived my life long enough to know
Everybody not as real as they say
Miscellaneous occasions where I needed you as back up
To pick me back up after the world started to act up, ahhh
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years that's all you had to say
That's all I needed you to say
That's it
That's all you had to say
That's it
That's all you had to say
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years, that's all you had to say
That's all you had to say
That's all you had to say

Bitch I'm back on that bullshit
Back on my number one rule shit
Back on my never not cool shit
Pull up in somethin', that cool whip
It makes a noise like a spaceship
Niggas be faker than facelifts
People switchin' like the late shifts
It's not a secret no more, no
Niggas be actin' like gang
Until you get changed, then they change
Bitches be screamin' my name
From wall to wall, that shit be insane
These niggas not gang
They just wanna go on Instagram and take a lil' photo
Hot on the scene, I just drove off the lot in a brand new four door
I remember moms drove a Volvo
Now mama's ridin' in a Rover
Had to go back to my high school
Look at my teachers like, "I told ya"
You might also like
That's all I had to say
That's all I had to say
Uh oh, uh oh
That's all I had to say
That's a message for me
That's all I had to say
If you wasn't really there for me
After all these years, that's all you had to say
That's all you had to say

Say, say
That's all you had to say
Say
That's all you had to say
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years
That's all you had to say
That's all you need to say
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years
Say, that's all you had to say
That's all you had to say
That's all you had to say
You waste my time and you play
No, no, no, no, not today
Say, I'ma be good on my own1Embed
