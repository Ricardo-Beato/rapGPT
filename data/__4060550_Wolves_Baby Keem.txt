Ayy, Baby Keem, this Cardo, nigga
You gotta be the youngest nigga doin' it, my nigga
The Sound of Bad Habit
Yeah, woah, woah

Dare I say it, fifty on my wrist, I might flip that, I might
Dare I say it, part Russian on my clip, I put VVs on my
(Shoot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo)
Dare I say it, bitch, I'm Baby Keem, I don't have time for trends
Dare I say it (Yeah!), how you love me, ho? You kissin' on my friends
Dare I say it

Bullets in this bitch, we go up like Baghdad (Like what?)
Wow, you got my ex, I'm past that, so have that (Yeah, yeah)
Your bitch bald head, why your BM bald head? (Yeah, yeah)
Dick game boom, where the boss at? My bitch know where the boss at (Yeah!)
Please don't be an asshole, you just let me fuck
You got no class, ho (Yeah, yeah)
Someone tell this bitch we ain't friends (Yeah, yeah)
Somebody tell this bitch we ain't friends, ho (Ho!), yeah, woah
Who that young nigga fuckin' up a bag? Oh, that's me (Yeah, yeah)
Pop shit, why you window shoppin' tags, keep it sweet (Yeah, yeah)
I make M and I share it with my grams, that's just me (Yeah, yeah)
Full clip, hundred bricks, I move sand (Yeah, yeah)

Dare I say it, bitch, I'm Baby Keem, I don't have time for trends (On my—)
Dare I say it, how you love me, ho? You kissin' on my friends
Dare I say it (On my—)1Embed
