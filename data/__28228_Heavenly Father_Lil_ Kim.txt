12 ContributorsHeavenly Father Lyrics
Heavenly father... Creator of all things
I humble myself... As I bow to the throne
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness

I pray for love... I pray for love...
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness

They say the closest ones to ya
Be the ones that sneak up behind ya and stick the knife through ya
That's why now I keep my friends to a minimum
Check for the ones wit the venom on they tongue
'Cuz niggas is snakes, they hugs be fake
Steal from they best friend at his own wake
I did all I can do and I took all I can take
This is it, crossin' me was ya biggest mistake
And was it enough that I split 20% of what I make?
Was it enough that I cut niggas half of what I bake?
Ain't enough that I almost lost all my bread
Bailin niggas out, keepin' a roof over our head
Enough is enough I wash my hands I'm done wit it
I ain't playin' wit you motherfuckers, come wit it
Keep the fam together God knows I tried
But shit ain't been the same since B.I. died
You might also like
(I pray for love... I pray for love...
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
Every day... every night
Keep the fam together God knows I tried
(I pray for love... I pray for love...
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
Every day... and every night
Shit ain't been the same since B.I died

Lil' Kim the first rap bitch to shake up the charts
Act like I ain't the leader of this Million Bitch March
Who got y'all rockin' the Prada
The Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Versace and Louis
Please, I'm the reason this rap game is unisex
I'm the reason bitches want bigger breasts
Show some respect where respect is due
(Without who?) Without me there'd be no you
These next few lines it to you women abusers
Last nigga I was wit... straight fuckin' loser
Niggas think 'cuz you give 'em ya heart
They can... dissect it and rip it apart, mm-mm
Not I, one nigga's in my eye
Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy
You lost a good bitch nigga you can't front
Lil' Kim is EVERYthing a man could EVER want
And that's real
(I pray for love... I pray for love...
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
Every day... and every night
Mm-mm, not I, one nigga's in my eye
(I pray for love... I pray for love...
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
Every day, yo... every night
Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy

When the... money is gone (So is ya friends)
When the... gas runs out (there goes ya Benz)
They just don't make my breed no more
Nobody lives by the code of the street no more
I don't deal wit the nonsense, I'm keepin' it real
Wanna do business wit me? Get in touch wit Hill

That's right any questions? No you can't ask me
Put ya name and ya number on a letterhead and fax me
U want Kim? Name the location
75 grand and that's just for conversation

I'mma remain loyal while y'all crumble like the foil
It's tradition to rock diamonds in my crown, I'm royal
Niggas ain't believe in me, they thought it was over
Baby girl risin' up like the early mornin' sun
Y'all think y'all know but y'all have no idea
What the fuck I been goin' through these last 7 years (Ahh man)
(I pray for love) Everyday yo, everyday yo
(I pray for love) And every night, and every night
(I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
(They just don't make my breed no more) Word
That's it (I pray for love)
(Every day, yo) (I pray for love) I'm the last of the Mohicans
(And every night) After me there will be none
(I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
(Nobody lives by the code of the street no more) Word

I'm sayin'
I just wanna be happy
That's all
I don't ask for much
It makes me happy to see my people smile you know I'm sayin'
I ain't a hater
I don't even like sayin' the word, *chuckles*, word
(Nobody lives by the code of the street no more)
I'd sacrifice everything I got right now to have my man Biggie here wit me
See that's just how I am
'Cause I'm a rider (Keep the fam together God knows I tried)
What good is it to have everything
If you can't share it with the one you love?
If you can't be wit the ones you love
Then love the ones you wit
Don't take nobody for granted, you ain't promised tomorrow
Karma's a motherfucker
Unappreciative fucks (Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy)
