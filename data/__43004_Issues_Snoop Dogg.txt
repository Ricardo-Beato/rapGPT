Bow Wow
Yeah
Dogg House
Oh serious
So I didn't know about all that
Yeah
Keep my industry as much as possible
You got too
Found out, found out
On all ya'll niggas
Check me out homie
Everywhere I go
I got niggas and bitches on my dick trying to take my shit
Now, I don't really know
But I try to keep my head to the skitta
Slice my piece of hitta
Whatcha hatin' for?
You better get up, get out and get your own, Nigga
Pick up the phone and holla at your folks
Young locs in the hood, mashing Dogg House
Fuck them other fools
D-O-double G
Kick back, blaze the sack
And catch a muthafucking big, Mack Attack
We blazin' up the dough
It'll hurt you
Nothing but purple in my circle
To the day we die
We gon' get money, bitches and high
Dogg House Gangsta Crip
Right back in your muthafucking ass for the R-2-G, bitch
What ya'll wanna do?
Seems like these niggas wanna talk all night
What we gonna do?
We ain't gonna say nothing more, we gonna get with ya'll, on side
That's how suppose to see
So all that straggling in the gate trying to get close to me
Ya'll niggas need to stop
Trying to flip the hip hop scrip
I snap, crackle and POP
Tell your friends and foes
It's a whole new year and situation and I'm still hating hoes
Will it ever stop?
Look I really don't know but on the up, I doubt that, lo
Now what about your hood?
Man, I'm doing mine they're doing their's
So I guess It's all good
And, what about your crew?
Shit, my crew is the Eastside
Fool, I thought u knew
Dogg Pound ain't the same?
Yeah, them niggas split up and did they own thang and went made their own gang
Money is thicker than blood?
That's fuck up but on the real that's how it is cuz, damn
The world just ain't the same?
And come to find out these niggas crossing out my muthafucking name
So what am I to do?
I put it on mind continue to shine
Everything fine
In G-O-D we trust
That's why ya'll suckers can't "Touch us, Touch us"
Meech u made the beat
And you know when we get together
Shit, we like bread and meat
We coming with the heat
Close your mouth cause Dogg House is definitely turning it out
And what about the cops?
I paid them and the ones I didn't I slayed them, haha
Will it ever stop?
It's like asking "Who is it" before a nigga even knock
The game is here to stay?
And I'm here to change the rules cause I'm a player that loves to play
Did you thank the lord today?
Think I did and on that note young loc, I'm getting ghost
Why you tell the truth?
Cause I'm hundred twenty proof from the turf to the roof
