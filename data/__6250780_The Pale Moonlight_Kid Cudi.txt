58 ContributorsThe Pale Moonlight Lyrics
Hit me up, give no fucks
Gettin' busy out the cut (Huh, huh), nigga, what?
And we do it to 'em, it's a pity, sing a song
Shy nigga, but I think she pretty (Ah), so it's on, baby (Yeah)
Call to the lost, we deep, deep (Huh)
Had it all twisted, dead wrong (Yeah)
How do I find what I can't see?
Lord, I was born to be strong (Hey)
Yes, yes, before I stress, I gotta get that feeling
This is just a sweet interlude, na-na

Amen, and the dice is thrown, they come in winnin' (Yeah)
What's this hatin'? (Yeah) Got no time, my boy (Yeah)
Nah, man, no one could've saved me
Look around and see this shit made me (Huh!)

They think they know me, I think not
Hеy, see me, I control the plot (Mmm)
Healing but I'm dеaling with some things, shit'll never stop
Yeah, caught in the moonlight
In the mirror, used to hate what I'd see (Mmm)
Healing but I'm dealing with some things, shit'll never stop

Just another Monday, burning indica with my bruh
See them lames, they rollin', smokin' mid, not me, Kid (Yeah)
Never trip, I'll burn that clip then run it back, call Plain Pat
Haters crumble, I'm they enemy, crazy fucker, no, don't envy, get that, ooh
I'm the only nigga standin', no, no, this ain't Henny
End of the days, baptized in fire, ooh, I'll survive for many, dude
And now we found new ground
Phony like to come around, bitches wanna cuff me, wow
And I'm feelin' whole, who would've thought for me?
See, nobody knows, still this hell on me (Yeah)
Catch me dip through town, mind racing, rev-rev-revvin' (Yeah, yeah)
See, won't count me out, zoomin' while I count my blessings (Ooh)

But something's off, I can feel it (Yeah)
My angel's gone (Shh), and I'm fuckin' loaded
Nah, man, no one could've saved me (Mmm)
I look around and see this shit made me (Yeah)

They think they know me, I think not
Hey, see me, I control the plot (Mmm)
Healing but I'm dealing with some things, shit'll never stop
Yeah, caught in the moonlight
In the mirror, used to hate what I'd see (Mmm)
Healing but I'm dealing with some things, shit'll never stop
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, mmm
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Yeah, yeah, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
