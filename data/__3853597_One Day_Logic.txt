86 ContributorsOne Day Lyrics
And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow
Dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be— alright

You ever wonder what it means to make it by any means
And finally attain your dreams?
On the come up, where they run up from the world of many fiends
I been at it since a teen, get this money, get the cream
Hard work and sacrifice but not a lot know what I mean
Most these rappers ain't got no class like bomb threats
And bein' ill is a disease, it's the onset
And it don't matter where you at, if you white or if you black
If you rich or you poor, we gon' always want more
But one thing I can be sure, as long as I got the floor
I'ma use this power to paint a picture of unity
And yeah I'm rippin' it up with that energy like it's two of me
Fuck the lights and the cameras, right now it's just you and me

One day (one day), I'll be richer than I was before
One day (one day), I'm 'gon have enough money to buy the store
One day (one day), like Sinatra said you know I'm finna do it my way
You on the road to success, I took the highway
You might also like
And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow
Dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be— alright

Feelin' blessed like I'm at mass, yeah, I'm comin' for that ass
Game been broken for too long, so I guess I am the cast
Left my Section 8 crib, finally found some greener grass
So ahead of my time, I wasn't born in the past
This right here a double-header with Logic and Ryan Tedder
Oh no, it can't get no better
And you know, we know we do it for the children
I never thought I'd see the day I made a million
Couple dozen later, feel like everybody feel 'em
I ain't mean to boast in that last line
But countin' money's always been my favorite pastime
Especially with a past like mine
Drugs in the household, never had a hand to hold
Even when I was homeless in the blisterin' cold, but I made it out
And if I can, you can, no doubt, I know—

(One day) I'ma do it like I never did it
(One day) I'ma have the courage to go out and get it
(One day) Do what I love and support my girl
(One day) I'ma shake up the whole world
And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow
Dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be alright

(One day)
Everybody tryna kill my light
Only thing I know it's gonna be alright (one day)
Everybody tryna kill my light
Only thing I know it's gonna be alright (one day)
Keep tryna tell myself in the morning things will be better (one day)
I keep tryna tell myself that tomorrow's different weather

And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be farther from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow
Dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be–57Embed
