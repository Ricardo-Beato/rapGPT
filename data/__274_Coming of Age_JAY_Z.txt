52 ContributorsComing of Age Lyrics
Yeah...
Come experience... life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Place: Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions: well, y'all know the actions

Uhh, I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking
To honies hawking, I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle
Nobody want to be like Michael where I'm from
Just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on
You might also like
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)

I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace
Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight.. balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day
And chasing crackheads up the block for my pay
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level
Pushing 'Vettes through the 'jects
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibrium
And stunned, I'm waiting for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge
I don't want a lifetime sentence, just give me the word

It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)
Hey fella I been watching you clocking
Who me? Holding down this block? It ain't nothing
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Hahah, I like your style (Nah, I like your style)
Let's drive around awhile! Cool, nigga
Here's a thou', A G? I ride with you for free
I want the long-term riches and bitches
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same
(On the low?) Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly (AND THEN YOU BLOW!)
Kid, keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards, then he through dealing I understand
Don't blow your dough on hotties
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break 'em for nobody
Hah, I like your résumé, pick a day, you can start
From now until death do us part, nigga (Right!)

It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (and stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up ( and stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)9Embed
