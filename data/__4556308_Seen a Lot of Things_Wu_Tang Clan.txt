6 ContributorsSeen a Lot of Things Lyrics
Yeah, yo

Expedite lyrics under a godly spirit
Thoughts forced to hang-glide even a bird could hear it
A bald head with gold metal wings look like it belong in a day
The coming of Christ, worshipping the Elohim
That's why I wear shades like Cee-Lo Green
It's darker than Don Cheadle, we're mean like his deleted scenes
The prognosis, divine opus
Artistic third eye open, it leave you stuck in a psychosis
Or the hemo-tosis
Spit venom like an African cobra in the jungle, knownin' my tongue is vulgar
I raise the Wu flag when they scream for glory
The clouds open the beam of light, you hear my story
Custom-made scrolls handwritten in coffee
And feather-tip pens one of the prophets brought me
And that explains why I spin on the axis
Born original, so my mind fades to blackness

Seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
I can't live without my faith so I don't walk without it
God, I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
I can't live without my faith so I don't walk without it
God, I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pledge music, we came up from grain up, cloth music
Acoustic jungle rap gave us all this project music
Blood in and plug niggas, get your mug dented
Steel rip steel, I'm finally out the drug business
Kneel proper for me
Helicopter beige, sage
And get blessings from professors on stage, winning
Nine swords, 36 Chambers
It's like a chess board keeps sliding, opponents get flamed on it
Training poems, been the Game of Thrones
We been raised and grown
These young boys come through, spray your home
Facts, they gave me the axe, now lay it on me
Criminals have to eat, it's a fact, shorty
You're damn right I go the square miles
We from the stairs
Thousands of pens could hear us from the rare sounds
Yeah, the phoenix coming
Ten Arabian Staten-adians
Who hooded up, known to get it bouncing

Seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
I can't live without my faith so I don't walk without it
God, I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Seen a lot of things, don't talk about it
I can't live without my faith so I don't walk without it
God, I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Seen a lot of things
I can't live without my faith
God I know you led us to do better on this road
On this road, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
