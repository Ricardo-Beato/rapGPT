13 ContributorsStolen Moments Pt. I Lyrics
Down da-down-da-down-down-down, what
Down da-down-da-down-down-down, what
Down da-down-da-down-down-down, what
Down-da-down, check it, check it

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I was trying to solve
Can't understand who the fuck was involved
Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane
In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame
My guy came to grab me in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart knelt
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swinging and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggas is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town?
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came in during the day when at work they was found
At the mound I stand vocal pitch high, asking who done it
Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked, about to go Wild Hundreds
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill, and get blunted
And left a roach in the ash tray I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
Overlooked beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kicking what shit was left all around the house
Thinking whoever came in on me is out

It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, yes it is
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, hear me now
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, yes it is
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, hear me now1Embed
