12 ContributorsGloin Lyrics
GG sports, it's in the game
Ain't no pillow talkers in the game
He's a dork, he's a lame
No you can't hang with the gang if you ain't gang
Boy, I know it, know it, know it
You ain't down like a fuckin' doormat
I'm ridin' 'round lookin' for the money
I hop out, I be gloin', gloin', gloin'

Ring, ring, what's on my line?
Girl, it's that, money, I swear it call all the time
Bang, bang! What's that? - My gun
I up this muthafuckin' blow it boy, better make it, run
Ding ding, what's that? A pizza pie?
If it's an enemy then I won't be surprised
Ding, ding, it's a friend in a disguise
Nigga act like they with you, they out to get you - aahhh

Smokin' on this chimney
God, look at what you did to me
I'm high these bitches be feelin' me
Aye, aye
You might also like
GG sports, it's in the game
Ain't no pillow talkers in the gang
He's a dork, he's a lame
No you can't hang with the gang if you ain't gang
Boy, I know it, know it, know it
You ain't down like a fuckin' doormat
I'm ridin' 'round lookin' for the money
I hop out, I be gloin', gloin', gloin'

Take a picture, it'll last longer
That lil lady got an ass on her
Chief Sosa, he got that cash on him
Call me Chief YC I got them racks, on racks, on racks on me
Cloth, I be cuttin' up
I just fronted you some money and you fuck it up
Goons with me, money with me, take it, fuck you up
Boy, you say that you's a gangsta, gotta look you up

Buda, look at what you did to me
Walked in the True Religion store, you know that I got plenty jeans
Johnny Dang, look at what you did to me
Walked up in the jewelry store, walk out like a damn mini freezer
GG sports, it's in the game
Ain't no pillow talkers in the game
He's a dork, he's a lame
No you can't hang with the gang if you ain't gang
Boy, I know it, know it, know it
You ain't down like a fuckin' doormat
I'm ridin' 'round lookin' for the money
I hop out, I be gloin', gloin', gloin'Embed
