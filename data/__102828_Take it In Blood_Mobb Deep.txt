30 ContributorsTake it In Blood Lyrics
I'm yawning while I wake up to the early morning gunfire
Another day another scar to acquire
Jumped out my bed, tried to break my alarm
Took a shower, and then I strapped on my firearm
Grabbed my Pelle Pelle cause I wanna look fly when I die
But it ain't my turn to say goodbye
How do I know? Some people call it instinct
I like to call it my luck, who gives a fuck
I'm stuck, in this environment and can't depart from it
And if I try I always end up back where I started
Plan A, square 1, there's no escapin'
So I've come to realize my truth
Tryna live my full life before my time is through
Clocks tickin', so I don't got no time for you
As I head outside, amongst the rest of the animals
Is where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand still
It's sorta like a family bond
We gather up all the soldiers and form into an invincible
Swarm of kids, now it's on again
Drinking straight from the bottle warm gin dripping down my chin
For the crippled children, you can't win against 25 niggas bent up with mac 10 semi-automatics, fully-addicted crime addicts
So long as there is cash involved, I gotta have it
There's many different levels to the criminal mind
Either you in it for the money or you wasting your time
You might also like
My destiny will be the death of me
Forever loving my peoples
Hustling, It's only right, nigga we struggling to survive
It's only crime that provides for me
So I resort to puffing dimes and dreaming of pushing a ride
Negative thoughts fill my brain but it's the projects to blame
Niggas forever getting loot while standing out in the rain
So when the sun shine, nigga will be writing a rhyme
And if a nigga owing, blood is how I'm taking mine
As I climb the ladder, of success with TEC's
Though I rather not have to watch my back get threat
But it's like that, so I adjust, fuck getting touched
Your man wasn't aware, that's why that nigga got bucked
I realize open my eyes once this shit got real
There's mad drama on the Hill when niggas getting blue steel
I love my niggas for that, we keep it real, get loot
And our identity is Timbs and army certified suits
Most def, my people hold me down whenever in beef
Talking all that bullshit but it's the gats that rules the streets
Survival of the fittest automatics recommended
Given a life sentence to crime until my life is ended

Niggas wanna point guns in my face, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
Niggas forever talking shit, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
Try to jam me on pack, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
Niggas running out their mouth, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
How we do it, how we do it
We taking ours in blood. (x2)
This city got me trapped like an animal with criminal thoughts
I can't seem to turn away from this unknown force
If only I can lay my hands on the source of my trouble
And maybe I can heal my scar before it bubble
It's like a plague, and there ain't no cure
We absorb this world's filth, therefore we're un-pure
My life is like a bad dream I can't seem to shake
Only my peoples who are equal understand or relate
The way we live is never planned, it just happened that way
So until tomorrow I'll just be surviving today
It's just another man, on this planet living for delf
Pops gone, I had to learn to be a man myself
But I, don't stress that
He did his dirt, now he pays back waiting in a federal laid back
Pops, times is different and things ain't the same
It's worse than ever, to get paid we do whatever
See some rather achieve goals and be a scholar
I rather get locked like you, earning a 6-digit dollar
Making the desert bird holler
Doing white collar crimes, but the fed time is hard to swallow
And digest so I protest the pen
I rather die before the jail cell sucks me in
And my peoples we all share the same thinking
We in synch, on the same tempo, making cowards run petro
Pull out the TEC, automatic metro
My shots chase you 'round corners
Leaving your family a bunch of mourners
And my all-around point as that
If you feel me you're guaranteed something you can feel back
Kid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me
You tried to blow me your weak side just showed me
Stepped out my door on 41st Side at 12,
Didn't see my crew around so I got bent for self
I had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9
It was a Friday night  had it bad one time
Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son
D's like "Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,"
So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking
Niggas be ass talking then convict them of extortion
Hold myself down the only way I know
Niggas pumping packs for free, in debt cause they owe
Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow
The maximum is death son you know how that go
Lye got me on point, paranoid for life
That's why I walk the street with heat especially at night
I represent the North side I hold the title with pride
And when its on, I use the infra-red for guide
Aim it at your temple, with no remorse and never sentimental
My crew is cold-hearted from all the foul shit we been through
Surviving shootouts, bullets hitting the fence sparking
Fuck my fingers, with guns niggas I'm marking til the blocks darkened
Doing my thing, let my gun clap
It's like that!9Embed
