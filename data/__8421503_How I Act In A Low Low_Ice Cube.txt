1 ContributorHow I Act In A Low Low Lyrics
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo

I am the wrong nigga, too fuckin grown nigga
To go for that nigga, I ain't 'cha hoe nigga
I got, a hair trigger, I am the dome splitter
The deep-sea sniper, you got the wrong niggas
Retire like Jigga, here comes the Attila the Hun
Killin niggas for fun, these rappers is done
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
I burn like the sun, continue to ball
Hе's got nuts and plus the Don touch
And split the fine dutch, Starsky call Hutch
Hе's laid, with some sluts, up in some guts
Just back, in the cut, he thinks he's King Tut
Cain't fuck, this nigga up, cause just, the nigga luck
That niggas, really love him and tear the city up
Uhh, even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'

Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo

Who me?
A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep living in these wicked times
Peep, niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stacking G's and heat
You can holler if you want to pleeease
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew beeee
Anemies and my range is on
Tou're in the danger zone
My fuckin' game is strong, Hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
From hustling and busting them rhymes
Ro my niggas up in Quentin
Down on Riker's Isle stay rile
But a nigga gotta use his styles
These niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo

I'm hard, Jehovah said I'm barred from the pearly gates
Fuck him, I didn't wanna go to heaven anyway
But my momma got me on my knees with my hands gripped
Talkin' about some "Praise the Lord" shit
Hail Mary, fuck her, I never knew her
I'll probably probably screw her and dump her body in the sewer
Our father, my pops stuck up dope spots big, black, and mean
With the fifth by the caradeims
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin' (shittin', shittin', shittin')
The lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question:
"How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake,"
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojo
Even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'
Them nigga know how I act in the low-low
Slow mo', nigga check out my promo
You mo'fo's can't fuck with my mojoEmbed
