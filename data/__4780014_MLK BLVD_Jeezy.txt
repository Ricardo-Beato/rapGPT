19 ContributorsMLK BLVD Lyrics
Ah (Yeah)
Hahaha
Turn everything up in there a lil' bit (Yeah)
Oh, we gon' keep that (Ha)
Yeah
Lex Luger on the beat, so what the fuck you lookin' at?
You claim you real but your Rollie fake (Rollie fake)
Say you my dawg but you know you're snake (Ss), fuck 'em
Like Makaveli, I'm about to snap ('Bout to snap)
Like Curtis Jackson, go and get the strap

I got the Dawn on Martin Luther King (Martin Luther King)
Hop out the Dawn on Martin Luther King (Yeah)
I hustle hard, I go and get the check (Check)
They want me dead just like I'm Malcolm X (Woo)

Had that ambition from the very start (Very start)
Back of that Bentley like I'm Rosa Parks (Haha)
You get that dirty money, best to wash it (Best to wash it, wash that shit nigga)
Just keep your eyes out for them false prophets (Yeah, woo)

This nigga talkin' like he 'Ye or somethin' (Like he 'Ye or somethin')
That nigga must be on that ye or somethin' (Damn)
Heard what I said, nigga, fuck Trump (Fuck Trump)
Say it again, nigga, fuck Trump (Yeah)
Somebody better call CNN (CNN)
Hello? I'm 'bout to make this shit G again (Believe that, nigga, yeah)
I'm war-ready like I'm Ricky Ross (Huh)
Yeah, boys in the hood, we knockin' Ricky off (Boom)
She think I love her, yeah, she fuckin' crazy (Yeah)
I'm 'bout to pass that bitch like Tom Brady (Woah)
These niggas pussy, boy, this shit a trip (A trip)
I'm better off beefin' with Taylor Swift (Haha)
You might also like
I got the Dawn on Martin Luther King (Luther King)
Hop out the Dawn on Martin Luther King (Yeah)
I hustle hard, I go and get the check (Go and get the check)
They want me dead just like I'm Malcolm X (Haha)

Had that ambition from the very start (Very start)
Back of that Bentley like I'm Rosa Parks (What the fuck?)
You get that dirty money, best to wash it (Better wash it)
Just keep your eyes out for them false prophets

I'm gettin' head in the back of the Phantom
Fuckin' with Ross and I'm back in Atlanta
When I'm in Niemans, I act like a scammer
Do the connect like I'm Tony Montana
Give me a chopper to go from the slammer
I tell the driver to go get my hammer
I got a bitch that's servin' them bricks
And everything lit like I'm holdin' a candle (Woo)
Feds disrespectin' me, investigations, I don't trap (No)
30 Million, 20 houses, I ain't think about that (No)
Niggas tryna rob me, I ain't trippin' on it, I'm strapped (Woo)
Huh, put a hunnid bands on it, we ain't beefin' out back (No)
Came from the bottom of the bottom (Bottom)
Richer that milli, they watchin' (Woo)
I done got back in my pocket (Pocket)
Ballin' in Houston like Rockets (Ballin')
I did that, we got a problem (Problem)
Fuckin' these hoes, then swap 'em (Swap 'em)
Just in the Rolls and drop 'em (Skrrt)
Dawn out the Rolls on Collins (Yeah), woo
I got the Dawn on Martin Luther King (Martin Luther King)
Hop out the Dawn on Martin Luther King
I hustle hard, I go and get the check (Go and get the check)
They want me dead just like I'm Malcolm X

Had that ambition from the very start (Very start)
Back of that Bentley like I'm Rosa Parks (Haha)
You get that dirty money, best to wash it (Better wash it)
Just keep your eyes out for them false prophets

You already know what it is, nigga (Hahaha)
Yeah, I would say I'm back but I ain't went no motherfuckin' where
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Oh, you niggas in trouble, nigga
Oh, yeah2Embed
