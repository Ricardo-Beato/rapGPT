(come on in)
Dinn-dnn-dnn-ta-dnn
(come on in)
Dinn-dnn-ta-dnn, dinn DNN DAH
(come on, come on, come on in)
Dnn-da-duh-duh-DAH, you BITCH ASS niggas!
(come on in, come on, come on, come on in)

As High As Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well, don't fuck with it!

Yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
Make it brief, son, half short and twice strong
No doubt, it took time searchin'
Eventually, it was prime urgent
For you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force
RZA throw in the disc, but then change the bank source
You can't flow, must be the speech impediment
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin' seven grams of green
Venue packed, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
To analytical analogy, insurance policies why
Said he know that sounds define the note
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes
Too many dope niggas I see starvin'
Catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
Wu slay regardless to whom or what, five mics, five nights
Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
A fugitive bass playin' rap czar
Smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar
You might also like
As High As Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well, don't fuck with it!

Tical got a hold on ya, doin' exactly
What the fuck I mari-wanna, this nigga nasty
Deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin', lovin'
The ways these rhymes keep comin', at cha, splash ya
Get your head piece fractured with killer cuts
From the Shropshire Slasher, rip shit up
Got this whole thing Tang mastered, sho nuff
An MC too good to be touched â€” John John
Bring the phenomenon, I cold crush
MC inferiorities, they froze up
Ice cold as we move on, saga unfold
Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger
Caught up in a cliffhanger
Yo, I-N-S, another code red, danger
Break out the vest, now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
Don't ever roam, in the naked city
Eight million stories, none pretty
Bomb 'em wit' the Witty Unpredictable
Conditionin' be critical
Peace to Tang, gettin' high on your physical
This next drink is a toast to your memory
When I go, how many niggas gon' remember me?
As High As Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well, don't fuck with it!3Embed
