18 ContributorsMore Life: Editor’s Note LyricsMore Life.
 
More time with family and friends. More Life.
 
I've still got vibrations to send. More Life.
 
They say that we could live forever
 
At night I pray it's true
 
I've done so much in my short time and still there's more to do
 
But if someone should come collecting
Sooner than we're all expecting
 
At least the life you lived was one for you
