Yeah (Yeah)
I'm reloading (I'm reloading)
Yeah (Yeah)

Yeah, I been countin' money so long it make my hands ache
Yeah, hundred round in the trunk, can't even stand straight
Yeah, gon' pop more than one, start hallucinatin'
Lot of diamonds on my arm, look like roller-skate
My hood hotter than a sauna, nigga, whackin' shit
Flood that lil' bitch out in stones and got a badder bitch
Posted on the corner where it's yellow tape
Had to buy my bitch a gun, gang affiliate

Told her "Don't be worried 'bout none, lil' one killin' shit"
I take criminals where I go, but I'm legitimate
Put so many chains on, it made my head hurt
You can't shoot it out the car, put in leg work
Why you gon' shoot him in the chest when you hit his head first?
I was sellin' water-water and missed the school bus
Had to place another order, bought more Lamb' trucks
Came up breaking laws, had to get my hands dirty
Used to hang with a bitch, gave my mans dirt
When they searched the rental, that's when I knew the feds were lurkin'
Watch my grandma go to prison, made my heart hurt
Bought a gang of cars like a pack of Starburst
You might also like
Yeah, I been countin' money so long it make my hands ache
Yeah, hundred round in the trunk, can't even stand straight
Yeah, gon' pop more than one, start hallucinatin'
Lot of diamonds on my arm, look like roller-skate
My hood hotter than a sauna, nigga, whackin' shit (Smurk, Pluto)
Flood that lil' bitch out in stones and got a badder bitch (Let's get it, yeah)
Posted on the corner where it's yellow tape
Had to buy my bitch a gun, gang affiliate

I'm a street nigga, I'm affiliated with the gang wars (Facts)
So many murders goin' on, I been hit, I ask a nigga what he changed for (Brrah)
I done seen my homie die right in front of me with his gun drawn
I'm fighting attempted murders, I still be walkin' 'round with my gun showin', nigga
I'm from the mud-mud, you need a job 'til my people make a nigga check stub
Shoot up the block and pick the shell-cases up and make the police officer work for it
I'm too street, when I'm in the zone, I take drugs by the two-three (Drugs, drugs)
And it's proof I don't fuck with too many niggas
Pull up in the hood in two-seats
Young wild niggas, I'ma stay around, ridin' hot cars with no license (Hell)
Don't play, he'll kill you like a dark-skin, whole time bro ass light-skin (Gang)
He'll kill you for a light ten, on a nigga ass like a tight end (Ha)
Bro, I gave you only 'til the night end (Night end)
Young street nigga duck indictments (Let's get it)
Yeah, I been countin' money so long it make my hands ache
Yeah, hundred round in the trunk, can't even stand straight
Yeah, gon' pop more than one, start hallucinatin'
Lot of diamonds on my arm, look like roller-skate
My hood hotter than a sauna, nigga, whackin' shit
Flood that lil' bitch out in stones and got a badder bitch
Posted on the corner where it's yellow tape
Had to buy my bitch a gun, gang affiliateEmbed
