Scented candles, incense burning when I take a shower

Manicured nails, I keep pedicured feet

Give me two blue dolphins and a couple Red Bulls

DJ Spinz Fuck Nigga
Dun Deal on the Track

My main bitch, her anklet
‘Bout the same size of a ankle monitor
If the bitch violate one time I'ma put her ass on probation
I'ma give her two scratches
She's a fuckin' good woman, I'mma give her a life
I'ma walk by shinin' with a bitch
Aye, say I had enough in my life
I got eighty chains, I got a hundred rings
And a nigga can’t take my ice
Caught a murder charge, but I beat the shit
‘Cause a nigga tried to take my life
I’m a millionaire, but I’m a country boy
And my right hand man got a Tonka toy
I sell, charge, I’m servin’ boy
Major saver, I’m the golden boy
Intercept the pack like Lawyer Milloy
Poppin’ and poppin’ and poppin’ the shit
Talkin’ that shit, now you shot in the head
Brick Squad niggas don’t shoot in the leg
Shouts to our fallen, I ball till I fall, and
The neighbors don’t talk ‘cause the neighbors are scared
A white girl, a black girl, a hell of a mix
Rollin’ up kush while they suckin’ my dick
On my team, it’s a tag-team
All my niggas get money
If you get tired, then tag in, then me and your freak’ll start fuckin'
Got two choppers, it’s a tag team
Four bad bitches and it’s all to me
Had to break into like ten houses to ride on these 9x17s
Oops, my fault, that’s your team’s line
I ain’t have time, I was grindin’ real hard
People goin’ crazy, and my mama goin’ crazy but belive it or not, bitch, I gotta thank the Lord
Ballin’ so hard when I came out of jail
Now I'mma get a scene now when the doors up
Sippin’ on lean ‘til I throw up
What you want to be when you grow up?

Damn, I think I love her, but I don't really know her good
Know I wanna fuck her, but really thinking if I should
How can I believe her? I don't even believe myself
Tell me how to trust her, I can't even trust myself
And I can't live alone, at the end of the day, can't fuck myself
I told her I'm confused and she told me to go fuck myself
Now I'm alone in this world, nothing left but me
But I was born all alone, so I guess that's how it's meant to be
But she was sent to me, and I didn't recognize
And I blame it on my pride on the fact I'm sittin' in silence
Eyes redder than a rose, heart bluer than a violet
My heart broke and I'm heartless and ain't no need to hide it

Most time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)

Now now, I've been so many places chasing paper under the sun
Wanna start the fam but god I can't be faithful to one
I got a problem, and it ain't like I don't feel for you babe
And I hate to see them tears on your face
But I can't erase all the memories we've made
Got my brain goin crazy it's like I'm stuck in the maze
Don't lose your hope in me, pray that you keep the faith
All your secrets are safe with me take that shit to the grave

Ride or die but you ain't got no car?
Push button I ain't got no key
Want to marry me and take half of my stash
Break her heart and broke the bitch in half
I hate these hoes, but I love my fans
We happy now, but the shit won't last
It's a plane crash to where I drop my bands
Hand to hand that's where I made this cash
I ain't tryin' to give it up so fast
Player smashed and now you in my past
Hundred bands I used to wipe my ass
Ace of spades but I don't need no glass
Got the racks imma pass so the hoes gonna dance

And every drank in my 'frigerator filled up with mud

You ain't never seen so many guns on one person
Dump truck, two trucks came on one Thursday
You need to switch up the shit you doing just ain't workin

Who me? Ain't’ shit…
Sittin’ court-side at All-Star
And this? Givenchy
My shirt covered in all stars
And y’all wasn’t wearing gold watches
‘Til you seen us wearing gold watches
And you may have a hit bitch
But this one out the ball park
And oh! lawnmower, just for the snake boys
Shoot your ass into pieces, man
And deliver it to your front door
Oh! Encore, they want more, they’re fans now
Got your girl ass clapping, hands down
Don’t approach me with your hands out
Sittin’ down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
It’s me, and I’m cool with it
You don’t know what to do with yourself
When I do it, I’m doing it fresh
Born to do it, so I do it to death
Calm in the steps, walking my dawgs
We don’t get along, I’m tellin’ ‘em fetch
Hit ‘em like “PA!” Hit ‘em like “PA!”
Shoot up the spot and I’m leavin’ like “Ah!”
Okay, you know I started from scratch
I got to the strip club just to relax
I get a flat tire, I buy a new car
You know what time it is, check the Rolex

Gucci so flossy, all my broads are bossy
Head 'till I'm nauseous, they keep me exhausted
Niggas wanna get it, Gucci went and bought it
My flow has been frostbit, haters wish I lost it
Traded like a foster, ever since a youngster
My lines has been bonkers, I deserve an encore
I heard that she dumped ya, chose me, then I dumped her
Stanky like a dumpster, funky as an oyster
Used to be an Oiler, I think he divorced her
He say he adored her, but he couldn't afford her
I don't have to bore her, financially support her
He do all that lame stuff, I just keep it gangsta

Please pardon me, please pardon me
I'm sorry I'm so spark-a-ly
I don't say this normally but please excuse my ornaments
Excuse me, excuse me
Please let me floss my jewelry
Gucci Mane ain't iced out, ha ha you must be kiddin' me
(2x)

I pull up in a Zonda, he pulls up in Honda
Thang short as a garden snake but mine's an anaconda
Wrist like the Artic, my neck is like the jungle
Wardrobe full of animals, my closet's like the Congo
Motor is a monster, trunk is a gorilla
Ask me where my top is at I left it with the dealer
Ballin' in the VIP they standin' in the line
My watch so stupid icy I can't even tell the time
My necklace full of diamonds, his piece gave him a rash
He bought it from the Texaco cause he didn't save his cash
Tryna be like Gucci Mane but he don't have a swag
Needs to take his jewelry off and throw it in the trash

I like that girl with them braids and them high-top Chevys
Got that bump for stick-up, Starter and the big boy chest
Tried to take it on the train but I just couldn't let him

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense
14 gettin drunk at a house party
They locked me up, they must have hid a half a ounce on me
Momma mad as a mother', daddy let him be
Gucci Mane, raised me to be a straight up G
Now my daddy hustle hard, but he love sum liquor
And my momma wanna leave him but she love the nigga
Everything kinda changed when I turned 16
Got the old school Regal with the chrome back rings
Like a newborn baby, man that bitch clean
But the motor fucked up and the transmission
And it's knockin down the street with the 415's
In Mackmile parkin lot, stright whipping
And I'm Bankhead bouncin, fo' hoes want me
Hit the half and give me two dimes for 15
And my mind's on gettin rich by all means
In the trap, cause this rap shit was just my dream

I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/senseEmbed

Before I could count through one, two, three, I had a trey eight
Can't cook roast, but I cook dope
A hundred P's of the good smoke

They say I'm getting skinny but all of my blunts stuffed
Ain't nuthin' skinny but them skinnies on my bentley truck
This molly really got me thow'd up in a Mulsanne backseat
Pow'd up two three's of the codeine
And feel im bout to OD

These niggas say they know Gu-wop but they don't know me
Ten G's of molly on me so i brought sand to the beach

The difference between a pimp and a street nigga dog
Is a pimp nigga work his bitch
A trapper work the trap, a pimp work the track
But a street nigga works his wrist
(4x)
Work ya wrist then, well work ya wrist then
I get my wrist game on cause my wrist game strong
And my wrist flexible like I broke my wrist bone
I got muscles in my wrist, cause the 4 touched the pad
I can't count every play I use different rubber bands
Red means 30 stacks blue means 10 packs
When I say Imma skreet nigga bitch I mean that
Hold up, Hold up, this shit won't cake up
80 thousand dollar profits so I bought a Jacob
Yeeaahhh, yeah that's my favorite word
Hit a plug with the herb and connected with the bird
He hurt he know homey where ya been dog?
Ain't no sense in callin' Gucci less yer buying 10 dog
I crossed 10 state lines just to bring the pack here
Go'n fill ya W-2s out cause I'm taxin'
I'll pay for that ass I ain't never been a mack
But ya front me a pack, I'll bring that money back
Gotta stay fresh, all white tee
Dark Gucci lokez so the boy can't see
Triple beam scales, 5 for the pound, 12 for the Q-P, it's goin down
Yeeahh, and I'm sick wit it I got major cake
And I blow 50 Gs on a rainy day
I got hard white, I'm with Gucci Mane
We fuckin 50 hoes cause they some Gucci fans
There's a stack dirty, there's a plaque dirty
His jeans cut and his slacks dirty
Blowin bubble gum, we gettin blew down
Like it's Mardi Gras, we got the top down
Imma chef too, name Dough Boy
Call me Boston, Georgia, or just blow boy
Fucked a bitch who's gettin stacked
Keep it moving less you movin' this pack
Whatcha say Gucci?
I was thinking out loud
Bout what?
Sellin whole better break the shit down
Sackin Gary Payton I was gonna buy T-O
Sat 24, a whole, 80 country "Whoa-flow"
I got 30 bricks sold add 60 mounds of gold
Im the same way in case yer baby mobile wanna snow
D-boy swag mane, shawty that's what I got
Got that Larry Bird yay, and it's jumpin out the pot
You be down motherfucker cause you know I'm too hot
Sick wrist game dawg I ain't talkin bout my watch
Want a chain like mine, but ya can't afford the price
You can call me frigidaire because I pack a lotta ice

Gucci Mane, Big Cat

Growin up was real hard on my block
Cops and robbers I was never the cop
To be the cop was considered a joke
I'm the same lil' nigga taught your brother to smoke
But now-a-days man I stay on the news
My every move airs up on the tube
Whoever said bein a gangster was easy
I got beef with BMF and I got problems with Jeezy
To be a gangster is a full time job
A Bad Boy but I ain't Black Rob
The pay's good but the hours are crazy
You disrespect me I'mma send ya to Grady
I'm never scared but I'm thinkin ahead
Because they don't bury the scared man, they bury the dead
An ex-con but I'm out on bond
Wave bye to the bad guys, Teflon Don

Got my name in the paper and my face on the news
Gucci Mane, Laflare, e'rybody, e'rybody know me
E'rybody know me

Matter fact if you see me fight a grizzly bear
I suggest that you help the fuckin grizzly bear
Ain't no pussies over here nah it's just G's
Ain't no time for no talk, nigga cock it and squeeze
Got these ho type ass niggas weak at the knees

Gucci Mane out of jail man, what I'm gon' do now
That Jeezy lil' bitch ass thinkin out loud

You motherfuckers must don't know who you fuckin with
I'm not a kid, Gucci Mane full grown
So bring the choppers, leave the nines at home
And call the coppers cause I'm aimin for domes
I'll have you call a full backup on the phone
The franchise, but Gucci Mane ain't wearin no white tee
You niggas hate the fact that niggas so icy
But fuck that, niggas don't gotta like me
Cause seein niggas shit split it excite me
Picture me high off the weed like a kite be
I took your bitch through my hood just to sightsee
I screen niggas so I stay on that skreet shit
And if there's drama then it's you I'mma deal with

My soldiers keep straps like they work for Uncle Sam
My chain like ugh, my wrist like damn!
I show up at the jewler with a hundred thousand cash
Drop top Porsche, inside DAMN
Outside red lookin like a Coke can
I keep a pretty brown round and young yellow
I gotta butta pecan Rican and a French vanilla

Got yam, a long Lamb', I'm sellin that grown man
Aw man, I'm on that Kush tonight
And I ain't stoppin chopper hit'chu and your body start rockin

One scratch on my Nike checks, I cop another pair

When she hit the bubble kush the bitch coughed up her breakfast

So much cash in the bag I make accountants lose count
Your girl say she love to see a thug iced out
With me and Speedy on the track it's the return of chicken talk

I had a hundred bricks, I got three left
Shootin cee-lo, middle of the day
I bet a hundred grand, the nigga iced away
5:45, in the afternoon
98 degrees, and it's the 1st of June
Niggas goin in, niggas gettin out
Everybody strapped and they gripped out
Twevlve on the dot... midnight
Bet fifty grand, on a pit fight
6:43, and I'm wakin' up
Cookin cocaine, and it's cakin up
Nine on the dot, rush hour
First you get the money, then you get the power

School's still in, but I'm at home
Standin on the corner, with some Ewings on
Turned fifteen, and I'm trapped out
Bet a hundred dollars, just to crap out
Seventeen now, and I'm on the grind
Never stand in line at the five-five-nine
Nineteen years, blood sweat and tears
Sellin innertubes like Goodyear
Twenty-one now, I'm a grown up
So when you call my phone, it's a zone up
Age twenty-five, and it's gettin worse

Try to throw me y'all test, said you met your real love
Make the head go, when she see me panics up
I have her walking out of filth, you got her walking out of church
Don't be quick, that loser chose her, ruler, come and get a chop
Baby, I don't think you want it, boo, but you should see what you count, Gucci
She ended up being with him, should've been with me
I thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be
If it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see
But until then I'mma fall back like a G
I think I need to fall back
I think I need to fall back1Embed

Show a little young nigga something, I could show a little young nigga something

I can front an ya'll nigga, got 100 young niggas
That's 100 young niggas getting money
Rather hang with my young niggas, OG's ain't 100

Jackpot, trap spot, crack rock, duece pot
Too hot, 2Pac, rob you with your own Glock
New watch, blue drop with no top, I'm so hot
All my shows sold out, my bitch got her toes out
Ten stripper, seven out of ten got so ass shots
A nigga got her locked, I need to send a bitch a green dot
She feeling like a codeine fiend when the lean out
I'm a lean junkie, pint buyer bring that clean out
I got big old diamond rings, man they look just like wedding rings
Hold another up, you's a runner-up trap king
A bird brain nigga go for anything, anything
Air heads, butterfly, ice cream, ice cream
But you can't throw piss on me, say it's lemonade
And you ain't fooling me, I know that chain fugazy
I'm being honest, you suck on me it's your lucky day
I'm sucka free, don't need no suckas round me anyway
It's Guwop

I was still a trap god at the Traveler's lodge
At the Golf Knights Inn, or the  Econolodge

Slap niggas with pistols til' they only can eat baby food
Colder than a refrigerator, hotter than a stolen coupe

Got my feet kicked up and my top kicked back
Smoking thrax in the back with your girl, what you say about that
If you ever run up, get your wig pushed back
In the club on the trap, it’s a fact, what you say about that

Popped so many bottles, I should be a bartender
So much cash on me that I should be a money lender
Moved so many pounds, they think that I’m a bodybuilder
What I spent last night, I could’ve bought an Audi, nigga
Bet a hundred chickens I don’t get no recognition
But fuck some recognition, I just want them hundred chickens
Slapped the top of my new girl like I’m an Indian
My only wish is that them bricks go back to ten again
Wake up, couldn’t cake up, got a king size in my kitchen
Bad bitch, no make-up, neighbors minding their business
In the roof, long face up, in six days or you missing
Don’t pay up, won’t wake up, and leave you sleeping with the fishes


It’s a well known fact that I keep big straps
Got them things in my bookbag and I’ma bust back
When lil’ mama seen my watch, baby had a heart attack
Got a Ziploc full of mollies, I call it the party pack
I’m my own fan, I’ma meet myself, so much money, got to treat myself
Call me old school , put rims on then I called it a day
Heard that Gucci Mane and them getting money, got ten cars but the show want twenty
Rims so big but the top so skinny, stand next to me, yeah it’ll cost you twenty
Mind your business, don’t cost you any, hold on, wait one goddamn minute
Gucci Mane came in a drop top Bentley, switched up, came in a hard top Benzi
Cool as a fool but sure ain’t friendly, worth more than a pool with no goddamn diamonds
Won’t stop rapping ‘til a nigga start shining,  still trapping so a nigga still grinding

And you can do me how you want, you got a Nicki booty
I spill my lean on her ass she got a sticky butt
I need half the deposit back, you got a rental booty
You got on 10 Versace chains that’s something Frenchie do
I got on 15 diamond necklace like Big Meech'll do
I murked the man and beat the charges just like Boosie did
Big diamond rings hang off my finger, Liberace kid
In a black Magnum pullin' up with plenty bails of mid

Racists drinking them dirty Sunkists
If I had one wish, wish for three wrists

Send a box so big that she can't lift
And a weed so loud that she can’t keep hiff

That's why I keep Tommy guns right by the bed
Hit in the head for something you said
Torture a nigga, I wanted him to beg
You leave me no options, you telling the feds
The 'partment was white, but I painted it red
Fuck a regret when you deep in my debt
You love her so much, then cut me a check
Pay me respect or I'm slicing your neck

Cut off your finger and cut off your thumb

Killing the driver and shooting the passenger

And the rap game paralyze the street life, I'm not sellin drugs

Fluorescent lamps in my crib, providing light for my seeds
I'm a get money marine, I sent coke in submarines
Irrigation machines, hydraulic water machines
My money counting machine sound like a sewing machine
Cash machine on the dresser, machine gun with the compressor
Dope presser machine, I'm re-rocking everything (presser)
Claim I'm laundering money but where the washing machine?
They know my trap house pump out quarters like a slot machine
In a futuristic whip look like a time machine
Old school dropped a lil' one fine machine
Making chips off coke and soda like a vending machine
Dog food with the quinoa in my blending machine
Sip so much Codeine and Sprite I need a soda machine
So I can sit it next to my joint rolling machine
And it's placed parallel to the Carbon 15
With the scope, monkey nuts, and the infrared beam
The machine don't make the man, the man make the machine
So many try to sabotage, can't stop the regime
Call me Wop the puppet master, I'm just pulling the strings
Screaming please don't look me puppet like American Me
Take a tour with me, a down south American G
Tryna flood the dirty south, East Atlantian streets
With this high grade uncut Colombian tea
Yeah I got it for cheap but you ain't get it from me

I'm leavin' Onyx with two hoes that dance at Magic
I drop my top in less than two seconds, it's magic
And if I don't make a mill' this month, then it's tragic

These bitches wanna fuck when they see the 'Wop
The club be goin' up, when they see the 'Wop
We pilin' hoes in the truck, when they see the Wop
These niggas put they jewelry up when they see the Wop
You know some shooters on the bus, when you see the Wop
You know these girls start actin' up, when they see the Wop
You know these boys start actin' tough, when they see the Wop
The baddest bitches leave with us when they see the Wop

Fuck that nigga, look at this nigga wrist
Fuck that nigga, look at this nigga wrist
Fuck that nigga, look at this nigga wrist

I'm Gucci Mane the legend, I don't fuck with you peasants
I'm too heavy to be petty, boy is you balling or begging?
Please stop calling me, nigga, 'cause I can't spare not a second
I gives a fuck 'bout a record, I got a criminal record
These boys so scared of big Gucci, they make subliminal records
Most of these rappers is pussy, they making feminine records
It ain't a nigga in the industry that I wanna meet
Your favorite rapper a sucker that's not surprising to me
You can't be talking to the police then try signing with me
I ain't cosigning these niggas, I'm only vouching for me
I ain't letting these soft ass niggas stand on no couches with me
You niggas wasn't in no trap house sacking up ounces with me, pussy

You'se a sheep in a wolf outfit boy you just a chameleon
And you blend in good, but I'll hurt more than your feelings
I'm a monster, a mobster, a contract killer
I'm a convict, a conman, an ex-drug dealer
I'm the bricks man, hitman, jack boy, kick man
Knock your door off the hinges, I hit big licks and
All my people like heaters, we don't like features
We love each other, but we don't like people
We crazy and violent and they can't teach us
Preachers couldn't reach us but the hoes gon' greet us
Cause we balling on you suckers, bitch want more on the bleachers
You niggas real dick riders, male cheerleaders
And you can't compete with Gucci so just follow the leader
Cause I'm still that boy from Zone 6 that might follow your Regal, pussy

Huh? Huh?

I still don't give a fuck how a fuckboy feel
How you gon' keep it real and your diamonds not real?
I do it so big, I make a hater feel little
I can't tell you why they hating, but I have an idea
You never liked me, probably don't like me still
But a nigga liking me ain't never paid my bills
I'm the realest nigga living, let's get one thing clear
And if you wanna get it popping, we can do it right here
I ain't never been embarrassed, I ain't never felt fear
I got post-traumatic stresses like I can't shed tears
I ain't even been out 6 months, but I spent 6 mil
Got a million dollar grin and a 10 million dollar crib
And my heart done turned burr-burr like my adlibs
In the kitchen going skrt-skrt tryna make a mil
Got these bitches screaming Bling-Blaww, diamonds in my ear
I send my shooters then it's pow-pow, another tatted tear
Yeah it's 2016, so it's Guwop year
When I was 16, I was making drug deals
These niggas say they getting money, I can't really tell
I made more money than them and I was in a jail cell

She took too long to come, that's why I left her
I'm Gucci Mane, I eat millions for breakfast
I came back in a 'Rari like I left some
I'm in a drop top Rolls Royce I feel like I left some
I got like 50 thou on me, who wanna fuck some?

And all the pain I caused my mother, bet she wish she had a daughter
Sellin' sets out my momma window, tryna' get a new starter

They want me to apologize, but I can't
You can talk about homicides, but I can't
You pillow-talking to these bitches, but I can't
You niggas snitchin' on your partners, but I can't
You let a nigga disrespect you, but I can't
You might can turn the other cheek, but I can't
You suckers rockin' fake jewelry, but I can't
I know they wait for me to fall, but I can'tEmbed

It's the return, East Atlanta, Santa!

Off the wall, off the chain
Off the top, I'm off the leash
So many freaks coming by the spot
Had to move, I broke the lease
I'm a dog, street gorilla
Going ape shit, I'm a beast
You feeling froggish, nigga jump
Got that pump on me, capiche?
I'm complete, can't compete
Pussy nigga check my physique
I'm a freak, made 3 albums in 6 months
I'm so unique, I'm elite
I'm prestigious, got two hoes in the Saint Regis
And all day all I dream about is sex
That's why I got on Yeezys
The Trap god but I love Jesus
Jesus, Jesus, Goodness gracious
All these sauce it's getting contagious
Done in Vegas stays in Vegas
Punchanella Punchanella
Put a brick down put it back together
Cash and dope go hand in hand
Hand you the yay, hand me the bags
It's Gucci!

But don't blame me, she got her own agenda
Tie dye shirt on like we at Coachella
Let's make love and make these other hoes jealous
I might just jump in the crowd like I'm performing heavy metal

Got a truck hop with no air see
But we're squashed up, no good
To the street life I'm in HD
Nuff said, a nigga so hood
Got a pentagram, no camera
I swear I'm 'bout the hood
Ain't 'bout her, maybe them 2
Maybe cool with these then more
I'm a rich sloppy you sure
The city's there, on tour
Got a little fucker we ball

Re-rock a brick, put it in the press then it gettin DDT’d
When I pull with them bales my nig', you know it's COD
All these diamonds drapped all over me, your bitch can't even see
These exotic fabrics make her wanna suck me up for free
Back to all these pints stuffed in my house and I don't even drink
All these anti-depressants I sell I think that I'm a shrink
Pop me one of those whatchumacalls and fucked her on the sink
Baby lickin' the back on my balls, now I can't even think
They just tryin' to keep up with the kid and ain't been out a year
Oh, you thought you was on to somethin' man you boys ain't even real
Metro why you wanna do this tape man you know that they gon' hate
Don't compare them lil' boys to me, twenty million out the gate

Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings

I'm so hood, no matter how much I'm still gon' get some rims
Baby lucky if she leave with me 'cause I don't even care
Bitch, Atlantic just mailed me 10 mills and I'm not even there

More concerned 'bout the cash you earn and not the clothes you wear

Huh

It's Drop top
It's Gucci
Huh, yeah
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Go

I'm a ex con, used to sell crack at the Texaco
Known for toting guns and it's what I'm on probation for
Had a murder charge, but they ain't found me guilty though
Keep my head on a swivel, 'cause I robbed a couple folks
And you can call me anything, but you can't call me broke, though
Was damn near 300 pounds, but I lost the weight, though
300 pounds of mid-grade, I took it 'cross the state, though
Got a bunch of tattoos, don't ask my why I got them, though
Got a lot of loved ones, but they ain't here today, though
Really miss my homeboy, he in a early grave, though
Gucci Mane a troublemaker, I'm trying to behave, though
Niggas keep on trying me, I think they feelin' brave, though
People say they cloned me because I changed my ways, though
I fly the dope in on a drone for the pesos
All about the bucks bro, but this ain't Tampa Bay, though
I'm a livin' legend, I do magic with the Draco
In the Peach State, but I'm sellin' Cali grapes, though
And Arizona mid-grade, I swear my life is great, bro
Gucci Mane and Metro, exclusive Jordan retro
I was sellin' half a O trappin' at the Zesto
You might also like
Aye wassup bruh, ride with me somewhere (Yo)
 (Huh?)
Yeah, I told the nigga "Meet me at the Zesto" (Dope)
He want a half of one (Go)

Gucci super cutthroat, but I was born broke though
Didn't have a pot to piss, so I wanted to throw it out, so
Niggas talk sideways, I hit him in his mouth though
Who you think you talking to? I had to stomp your mouth, bro
Baby got a pretty face but I just want the mouth though
You ain't come to suck me up, then what you in the house for?
Brand new Air Max and they ain't even out though
Drippin' sauce excessively and it ain't even called for
If the jewelry ain't blindin' me, then what it even bought for?
Niggas want to sign to me, but I can't even vouch for
Back to back with Ralo, and we ain't even deep though
How yo clique compare to mines and y'all ain't even street though?

Goin' quadruple platinum, that's not on my bucket list
Bitch, my Rollie went quadruple platinum, you should see this shit
It's no way possible I'm falling off, that don't exist
I wasn't rappin', I'd be sellin' narcotics just to pay the rent
That new Lambo on my bucket list so I just bought that bitch
It ain't a chick I feel that I can't get, man, that's that sucker shit

Bucket list, drop top 'Rari, scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, mega mansion scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, super bad bitch and she rich like Gucci rich
Bucket list, no more sellin' bricks, that's off my bucket list

Ha
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words

Geeked up, she can't even talk
Damn, it's all my fault
Got me nervous 'cause she took a molly
She can't even walk
High as fuck, we can't even fuck
Throwed up on my Chucks
Just my luck that I caught a slut
Can't even mother
Fell asleep and woke up
With a model when you came
And she shake like a Coke bottle
Baby, what's your name?
Reminiscent, got me thinkin'
Damn, Guwop, I'm off the chain
Fucked so many famous bitches
But I'm scared to name they names
There's so many drugs I lost my mind
But I'm not ashamed
I grew up sellin' cocaine
In love with Mary Jane
Pay attention, this non-fiction
I couldn't even make it up
Drinkin' lean like I'm Pimp
One day, I might not wake up
A description of a young black man
Trappin' with a pistol
Wanna kill just like Tony did
When Manny fucked his sister
Monkey nuts on a Glock .40
I can go gorilla
So I'll point, he said 12 comin'
I done peeped the signal

Painted mine like cinnamon
Burnin' weed in the Benjamin
Really high on my adrenaline
40 points, 10 assists
Game over, hit or miss
Mary J, they reminisce
Bitch niggas been on the list
One stack and the guns clap
Run the label like I run the trap
All sauce like I'm on the Perc'
Biggest boss with the warmest verse
Ladies stunned when I'm on the scene
Biggest guns, glowin' Bs
Homies had to kill for your charm
I gave the chain back to your mom

We big flip jugs, we took it off the forklift
The way my plug kick it, you'd think he had a black belt
My scale so big, Big Boy can weigh his damn self
Two thousand pounds of mid, I sold that shit my damn self
Washer full of cash, dryer full of X pills
Red rag in my pocket same color my 'Vette is
My number lower than a eeé from Texas
A quarter mill in the mail is an investment
A sniper rifle like a soldier in the desert
An Eagle on me, boy, I'm known to tote a Desert
I sacked an ounce up before I sold a record
He want a brick, I told him, "Meet me by the Checker's"

In the trap them bricks going for a cool 
Stealing bases like Sammy Sosa playing for the Cubs
I be hustling, I be working, I be trapping like a bitch
I guess that's why my swag so arrogant
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich

See I'm a shiner, I'm a grinder, I be all of the above
And if you want it I can get it cause I be plugged with them drugs
I might be low but ain't not joke I keep the pistol by my side
It ain't no license  just the way I'm gon' ride
My money keep talking
I tell these niggas keep walking
In the trap I be postin' but in the club I be ballin'
My pockets is low
My niggas know what it is
I ain't coming to the trap until I catch me a lick
Stupid fruity swag
That's L.A. up on that shit
I be booming, I be bunking, yeah I stay up on that shit
God damn I'm getting money
Man I'm trapping like a fool
In the  posted up  without my tool
Two for five where I be
Niggas shine where I be
Zaytoven you a fool, damn you riding on that beat
Nigga know where I be, posted 
You can drive thru my trap nigga call my shit McDonalds
I got twenty on my neck
Ten on my wrist
Five on my bitch
Nigga I'm Hood Rich
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch
I be booming, I be bunking, I be trapping like a bitch

I was piss poor, sleeping on the dirt floor
And we couldn't pay the rent so it's a notice on the door
The neighbors been noticed so what I'ma front for?
Using pennies for the bus like what I'ma stunt for?
Mama workin' like a dog but we still broke
We lighting candles in the house 'cause the lights off
The best thing that ever happened, I got kicked out
Bought me a Chevy, got a grill, now I'm gold-mouthed
I lost my daddy last year, I couldn't even cry
'Cause it's so hard to shed a tear, he didn't even try
The only person in the world I could fully trust
Was my older brother Vic, that's just how it was
Top in the trunk, this for Bankroll and Slim Dunk
I miss that girl Beasley, she was a real one
I had an artist that I treated like my own son
Gave him the shirt off my back and my own gun
R.I.P. to Shawty Lo, Mister Don Don
It's been rainin' so long, when the sun comin'?
I'm drop top but put the top up when the storm comin'
Sometimes I think about my past, it make me start tripping
I was gifted with a talent that was God-given
But I was so hard-headed I would not listen
Sometimes I sit and I reflect about that cold prison
And doin' pull-ups with a nigga got a life sentence
They gave my nigga Grant life, he only gained on me
Five years later, how we in the same room?
You go to jail, that's when you see who really love you
I don't think nobody love me like my auntie Jean do
R.I.P my auntie Jean and uncle Goat too
How you gon' judge me? You don't know what I been through
I think these killers need a hug, I need a hug too
You send a slug, I'll send a slug, you know how thugs do
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too
I'm just a work in progress, I'm not even through
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too

This watch here cost an eighty, Guwop's an eighty baby
Grew up in ATL but don't do no roller skatin'
Lil' mama wanna suck me and she ain't never met me
She said she had a dream that she fucked me in my Bentley
Baller of the century, and they could never clone me
He say he worth a mil, but I got a million on me

Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money

Call it perfect timing, I don't have no opponents

A bitch'll slit her wrist just so she can be my sidepiece
She wanna stand beside me, I just threw up a nine piece
If she thick as a horse I might buy that bitch a Porsche
If she mean nothing to me, Wizop I'm worth a fortune

Damn I miss my dog man he should be here

Fresh outta jail, made bail for the tenth time
Shoulda been said something cause it's been time
You see me smiling but I'm crying on the inside
Thinking bout my homies locked down on the inside
I've been spared so many times, could've been died
Coulda lost my sanity, my brain been fried
It's so hard to understand when it's God's plan
And it's not in my hands but in God's hands
Free my nigga Putang and free Papa Joe
And every soldier ten toes who ain't never told
And free my nigga Slick Ralph and my Uncle Grant

Set for the crib, fugitives on a plane
Out of here bitch like my name Martin Pine
Know that bitch here with a fugitive name
Serial killer, clique fugitive gang
My mama birth me with the top that’s so fugitive
Try Dillinger was a top it’s a fugitive
Wrist game the dopest, the talk is a fugitive
Don’t hocup pocus, turn deuces to 4
Fugitive squad tryna kick down my door
Fresh out the bed, flush the dope down commodes
Underground railroad, they call me a mole
Bonny & Clyde, fugitive with yo ho
Summertime fugitive, even in snow
(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
El Chapo mane he a fugitive
Griselda Blanco was a fugitive (RIP)
Big Meech, he was a fugitive
Al Capone was a fugitive
Gucci Mane was a fugitive
Bugsy Siegel, fugitive
Wrist cost 10 bricks, fugitive
No serial number, my uzzi a fugitive1Embed

But I was just a hood-boy, bricks in my culdesac (brick)2Embed
Brrr
Guwop

A casualty of war
Tijuana cartel man, they killed him in the car
He think he invincible, think he above the law
Gun'll drip, designer down, I'll merk you in the mall
Now Ahki got that purple chop, he still pray to Allah
Most of you rappers pussy now, they need to wear a bra
Carefree stare, she lick me down, I skeet all in her jaw
Thot bitch she so groupie, now she slurped it in the mall
My quickshot don't settle in her jaw
Wedding cake 800 pounds, I'm tryna serve you all
Behind the wall, they locked me down, my back against the wall
You think you switch up on me while, but mother-fuck you all

Niggas trynna buy my style, but it ain't in the mall
My bitch act so boujee, now she don't even like the mall
My closet designer down, that shit look like a mall (s'Gucci)
That shit look like a mall
Niggas trynna buy my style, but it ain't in the mall
My bitch act so boujee, now she don't even like the mall (mwah)

Niggas actin' ignorant, crazy and belligerent
Plug up the ticket, an' ain't nobody diggin' it
Ain't nobody kickin' it, louder niggas switchin' it
Plugs cuttin' heads off, arteries and ligaments
If you owe 'em fifty cent, in a bad predicament
The gon' bust your head bout them green dead presidents
Wipin' down the evidence, shooters at my residence
All this water 'round, it got me high, I think its heaven-sent
Doors, really kickin' it, the woes, really sendin' it
Cash, I be spendin' it, an' packs, I'm really shippin' it
A hundred bricks of three came in, an' I can see it vividly
Drop-top like J.F. Kennedy

Niggas trynna buy my style, but it ain't in the mall

I pop a whatchya-ma-call-it, but it got side-effects
Dick rock-hard like a math test
Hit it from the side, that's a side-effect
I'm a Zone 6 nigga, now you're my bitch
Slurpin' up the drank and it got side-effects
Shit expensive, bitch, you thirsty like a cactus
Tried to DM a bad bitch, but he got catfished
Doin' editin', turns out she's just a fat bitch
Trynna keep her with the 'Wop, but it got side-effects
He filin' bankrupted, turned up on the internet
He lease the Wraith, he deficient on his taxes
Thought he was trappin', where the cash at, you stashed it
I'm El Gato, front door, but it got side-effects
My dope defy the laws of science, I'm a scientist
I put a key in my rerock machine and press it
It came from Tijuana but I had to skretch it
Cartel affiliations, man, they come with' side-effects
I'm talkin' pull up to the plug in a private jet
I'm talkin' numbers so low, it got me cheesin'
Blowin' money like trees, Big Meechin'
I'm droppin' good game on your big peaches
I just scope-tracked the trailer, free reefer
Side-effects strike first, Grim Reaper
Desert Eagle, four-five, street-sweeper
Like Gucci really see dead people
I mean really man, I see dead people
Body found, don't make it a sequel
Side-effect, me an' you are not equal
Growin' up, I did shit so evil
Yesterday, half a mil' for two features
Niggas warin' in the streets, we ain't equal
If I get caught, I see no evil
A side-effect, I bought a brick and two Beepers
How you snitchin' on a nigga that feed you?
A side-effect, get rich, they turn evil
Is that a car, is that a plane? No, that's a creature

I'm leavin outside to kill em' all
Me and my bad lil broad
Damn, my offset's tall
This is just the way we crawl
Candy painted cars on chrome
That's how we get our shine on
Atlanta niggas, money so long
Trap niggas got it goin on

Ralph with the business, trap boy is it
Paint like ,  like church biscuit
Rims like midgets, offset 6s
Cartier lenses, with the thousand dollar britches
Came to the club, me and 3 or 4 bitches
8 or 9 bitches, told shawty, that's senseless
My number's so loaded, the junkies think I'm kidding
Paint so wet, like it can't stop dripping
Rims real big, like Jay-Z lips
When I hit the bar, bring 3 or 4 clips in
3 or 4 chicks in, 10 or 12 henchmen
10 to 12 racks man, Gucci Mane back man

I'm leavin outside to kill em' all

Ay, these niggas mad cause I took off
Picked myself up, and brushed that dirty look off
Yeah, I ball hard, and spend a lot of cheese
Young Ralph and Gucci Mane, that's a lot of cheese
Piss yellow diamonds, they'll make you freeze

Let's go, haha, tick tick
Six spots, twelve stoves, and I need more pots
And I tote more knots than a Boy Scout got

The junkies say it’s finger lickin’ how I whip up powder
I took your food and Prada shoes and added me more power
And if you bought some Sour Diesel, then your dream gone sour
I treat your shooters like cowards, make your team look sour
I feed the hood with the bowl like I cook clam chowder

I made the Forbes list bitch, man you just a subscriber
My mam say you just a lyin’ ass, conniving lil’ diver
My nigga killed his own brother, seen that shit in the bible
Man, Joe Blow chose the fork but you chose the screwdriver
I may did never steal a car, but I did cash off on nine of them
I go so hard I make you dump your whole roster to sign me
And you can find me in the six with all my shooters behind me

I’mma say a prayer, get a blessing today (amen)
No grey hair, I ain’t stressin’ the case
Make you scratch for the chase, I invested in yay
Man what else can I say? I’m still gon’ flex in they face
What the fuck can I say? I got racks in the safe
Get wrong that gat on my waist, that house they trap in that place
Leaning so hard on the drank, I forgot what to say

Who locked up and couldn't make it
And they sittin' at the county jail just waiting

Skippin' school and gettin' high, that's no lie

If I was high as fuck, then he was high as fuck
If I was fly as fuck, then he was fly as fuck
Then you stole something and that was fucked up
And that's bad luck, but good luck with that
And now you can't get shit from me, but an old snapback
And you always knew my only rule, but you still play with this dude
And I learned from the old-heads, gotta set your rules or be ruled

Because I beat him like a hammer
The shooter shot my nigga Juice
A couple times over by Gresham
Wish I was there just to help him
He pushed on, so I respect him
Before the fortune and the fame
Deep in the game, me and my gang
Behind my rights to getting my record
They tried to murk me for my chain
Two tear drops under my eye
Because I wish some days I could cry
But to lose my self-respect
My nigga, I would rather die. Gucci!

Huh, D-O-G
Wow, wow, wow, wow, Wop

Is it a crime to be full of yourself? 'Cause I'm gettin' cocky as hell
Ain't got time to be goin' to jail but I been feelin' myself
For three months they say Gucci canceled, I'll be rockin' Chanel
Know you heard 'bout my rep, I got murders on my belt
Black and green Moncler ring, call that bitch the Boston Celts
Sent a fiend to rehab but that shit didn't even help
Tell the haters when they see me, "Look, but do not make no step"
Slidin' through Charlotte in my Spider, man, I think I left a web
Dope jumping like Spud Webb, tell a hater go to hell
I'ma send a ting through the mail and drive the money in myself
Early teens, East Atlanta, we was broke, we jumped the rail
On my dick, had to ante up, pitch in to pay for bail (It's Gucci)

Water like a whale, cold as a polar bear
The human chandelier, coldest nigga ever lived
Diamonds in my ear, I look in the mirror
What you lookin' at? The coldest nigga ever lived

Brand new truck, it's yellow, and it came with an umbrella
Shawty got a bod' but she's a known woodpecker, 'pecker
Crowd full of folks, Coachella, 'chella
Mob hit like Costello, 'stello
Wise guy like Goodfella (Fella)
She wanna suck me up, I let her, let her
Beat her from the back, it's better, better
Told her hit back, she better, better
Gucci Mane got forever cheddar
Save a bitch, I never ever
Grippin' on her head, I pet her
Took her out to eat, I fed her
Knew she was a freak when I met her, met her
Fly ass and I jet her, jet her
She drink it all up like kettle
Dick rock hard, it's metal, metal
Head so good, got a medal, medal
Bad bitch, I'ma go get her, get her
Broke hoes hate, they bitter, bitter
I'ma leave money for the sitter, sitter
I'ma keep rollin', they quitters, quitters
They gon' keep trolling on Twitter, Twitters

Ran off on him I used my feet, Atlanta Hawks, Miami Heat
These Christian Lubs cost thirty-three

See the white charm? And see the necklace?
With no muscle, that dude be flexin
I'm a got to Lenox, I'm a go to Saks
Cause I turned that 10 piece into like a 20 pack
My gun enormous, my suit like the hornet
None not gon mind to drive it was just parked em
I'm a stunt I'm a stunt cause I got money
Crack rock I can turn a thug into a junkie
Bitches I can get em with no problem and it's nothing
Told her I'm a stunt, I can get you out that Honda
9 millie, 40 cal, 4 5 dumper
For them niggas hating when a young nigga be stuntin
Stunt in front of em, stunt on homie
Nigga I'm a stunt stunt stunt...

I'mma stunt this summer, I'mma roll me a cup then stunt in front ya
Roll me a blunt cut the trunk up homie, then I stunt on homie

Gucci got it, Gucci got it
But you know nothing about it
You still stuck in the projects with no money in yo pocket
I seen you at the party, you still ain't got no car yet?
You passenger seat of your homeboy car, boy that's his main bitch
Man that's some deep shit, some will say weak shit
Yo bitch pussy so deep, it make a nigga seasick
Larty's on fugates, lowy's on the mazze
Vette on Ashantis, bitches in the party
Bitches in the lobby, we kickin just like sake
Benihana sake sake monotoly backe
Gucci Gucci Gucci mane or call me Gucci race
The million dollar man, call me Gucci deveoci

Ayy man, it's The Oddfather
Not The Godfather
A.K.A. The Trap Father
Trap God 3 on the way
Guwop vs. Gucci on the way
I'm the only nigga can make 5 mil' sitting down
20 mil' on the first month I get back
100 mil' 'fore I get out this shit
It's Guwop, 1017 Bricksquad, the Oddfather, enjoy

Father status, La Cosa Nostra mentality
Last night I plead insanity, in court screaming profanity
Free my nigga Chapo Guzmán
R.I.P. to Griselda
Feel like we the Felix brothers, Mexican Mafia Records
I might buy a laundry mat just to clean the monefa
I done let Keyshia see too much, so now it's cheaper to keep her
Got so many enemies, can fill the Phillip's Area
And I hunt like an hyena play, with racks like Serena
I was born broke in Alabama, man my family was poor
A young snotty nose sleeping on my granddaddy floor
Is this a crack house, 'cause junkies keep walking through the door
Plus my stomach having cramps about going to steal out the store
And if my school lunch wasn't free I wouldn't have nothing to eat
So many cousins at my house, I didn't have nowhere to sleep
Didn't notice I was poor till I walked down the street
Rather have holes in my shoes than have no shoes on my feet
My family tree filled of alcoholics, nigga, gangstas and theives
Had to learn how to fight before you learn how to read
Wish my grandma was still living, miss my sister Charlese
'Cause she the only one I know kept it realer than me

Sticky cannot stick to me, if you see your chick with Gucci
Think before confrontin' 'ruly, ain't my fault your lady choosin'
4:30, still blowin' purpy, O.A. Verdy rollin' dirty
Wardrobe clean, that's just detergent, got your girlfriend pickin' purses

No diamonds and no pearls
I fuck her you stalk her
She break you like I taught her

Last week scrape girl on custody
My aunt got nothin' but pictures and memories of her daughter
Paint a picture with my words, I'm a fucking author
Go get a mark up, five hundred thousand my marker
Forever good, I learned to hustle from my uncle
And I'm so hood, it's hard for me to get a sponsor
Rap shit is long as the street, 14k all over my teeth
Tattoos all over my face, saying I'm one single away
How when I'm dealing the yay
Fat boy, I'm eatin the K
New rolls and forgis on a rari I'm ballin' like

True story
I used to hate Christmas
For real

On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
A half of a brick, told me feed my family
I took it to the hood, then I dropped it in the sink (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Then I whipped it into a whole thing
Jumped off the porch early, man it was '93
I had old hoes on my dick when I was 13 (Facts)
On the second day of Christmas, I bought an MC
Supersport and I set it on G’s
Wopped so many niggas had to paint that bitch green
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas, nigga ask about me
On the third day of Christmas, my old plug sent to me
Ten milk jugs full of pills and like eighty bales of weed
On the fourth day, said, "Fuck that shit," went on a spree
I got niggas still want payback for shit did in '03
It’s vibe, what the fuck you want a fifth and on the sixth
On the seventh day of Christmas, got a new drum for the stick (Wack' em)

Shit funny now
Ain't funny then, yeah

Wow, Longway got chicks in the Phantom

Had my old bricks at my old bitch’s house
Paid her rent full time, then I kicked her out nigga
New plug, hey I got to switch him out
New cars, hey I got to switch em out
80 K for the S6, I could get that that bitch, that bitch, that bitch

Fuck it up, that’s what I do for her
Let your hair blow shit, no roof for her

If she don’t fuck, then you know that I’m booting her
Who the hell taught you how to fuck, girl, tune it up

Looking for some competition
When it comes to confrontation
Empty all the ammunition
Balling out
You penny pinching
Cooking dope in momma's kitchen

Vacuum seal a half-a-milli

I said abracadabra and hocus pocus
Then the top disappeared and I went to Strokers
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm not no local joker
But I'm locally invested in Coca-Cola
I'm made a bonafide business off baking soda
Give you one more summer then I'm taking over
I got 100 pounds of loud, you can smell the odor
I got the thangs for 45 but don't tell 'em I told you
I'm a Bricksquad soldier, I thought I told you

If you ain’t get no money, nigga, what’s yo purpose?
Don’t need no clowns in my circle, this is not a circus
I keep on doin’ what I’m doin’, what I’m doin’ workin’
They say the watch on my wrist is picture perfect
They say the way I hold the pot is picture perfect
I left the lot and dropped the top cuz tops they make me nervous
I got the game, all I got, my life and my verses
And all that sneaky bitch shit, it came to the surface

Just to wake up it’s a blessed day
But I’m boomin’ cage like everyday
Gonna muscle down I put my hustle down
I gone makin’ money like several ways
Got a traphouse in the neighborhood
Get my grass cut by seven J’s
Flashback, yellow Lamborghini
I pulled up to the figure eight
Got a book man, I’m the coupe man
Get the S-scrolls, I’m extra paid
I pulled up in that Rolls Royce
All the pussy niggas had nothin’ to say
Cockroaches in the industry
I think it’s time for me to fumigate
Asenzi(?) committed when I get through those pretty J’s
Might buy a pain, I might crack a seal
Then pour for my ace of spades
Might buy a pound and then break it down
Then smoke a pound in the VIP

If being filthy rich is a crime
I guess I'm guilty bitch

I killed the rap and last night
I pleaded self-defense
I guess I'm guilty bitch

These suckas talking nonsense
I killed your homeboy
Cause I don't have a conscience
I'm strapped like Bronson
Brick Squad, Trap House, beat bunking
I'm wild like Tarzan
I'm swinging through the Zone 6
In Ferraris. It's on again
I go to win, strap-for-strap
I go rap for rap, I rep the trap
Refuse the death but game to slap
My phone is tapped
I'm off the wall and off the scale
Came out of jail like
A bat out of hell
I refuse to pay up, gotta salute the myth
Got Clientele, I might as well
I'm moving weight from state-to-state
I gots to get my aconchelet(?)

Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps
Look like speed bumps, look like speed bumps
Big knots in my jeans, look like speed bumps

1017 and what’s the meanin, y'all really mean it
The cleaners, blocks in your tires and you can’t peek the meters
When I scream it, I really mean it, won’t see the evening
Man, I’m freezing, so fuckin cold that it got me sneezing
There Four Seasons, these stripper hoes will suck me till I'm sleepin’

Hit the bank, withdraw a million dollars, then make it rain at the house
Vacuum, then a month later I done found like 100 thou

Your niggas swag so stanky it’s an extra charge
Get in that ugly ass car, I’m dropping sexy bars

I'm in the kitchen, homie, whipping up a deuce
Niggas looking sick, I call it chicken noodle soup
Chickens in the living room, we call it the chicken room
Birds everywhere, it's looking like Atlanta zoo
Pounds in a stash bag, chickens in the coupe
Birds like a petshop, got pigeons on the roof
Working with the fork, turn a one into a two
How ya niggas snitching, gotta watch out for ya crew
Find me on 2-85, flying around the loop
If you want to smoke, holla at me for the fruits
If you want the X, holla at me for a few
I'm standing over pots like ya mama cooking food
Trap going crazy, going crazy
Going crazy, this bitch bunking
The work came early, on Thursday
So Friday, I'm gettin' money
Checks came next day, on Saturday
It's payday, the J's coming
Sunday my off day, I ball all day
I smoke all day, then big stuntin' every weekend1Embed

Only fuck with bad bitches, this is for my bad bitches
Started off as friends, but now we got a plan
I call her on her cellular, she’s calling me her man
Let's go to Japan, maybe even France
Spend a hundred grand overseas, we holding hands
Gucci, Louis, Prada, it doesn’t even matter
I spoil her like my daughter so she love me like her father
Cruising the Atlantic, isn’t it romantic?
Spaghetti strap dress, she ain’t wearing panties
Sex her on the couch, freak her on the sink
I think tomorrow I might go buy her a mink
Sex her on the couch, freak her on the sink

745 nigga
For all my niggas out there handling their business
All my niggas handling their mothafuckin business
NY to A dog I'm in New York right now

Came out of
Came out of jail on a monday morning
Whole world watchin' like I was performing
745 with the Gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
6 months ago I was sitting my cell
Now I'm sittin in a new V12
Niggas always said that I wouldn't blow up
I touched rock bottom can't go but up
Left Big Cat and I signed Mac Breezy
Word on the street that I don't like Jeezy
But fuck that I'm tryna rape the budget
Beat the murder rap niggas change the subject
Jumpin' out the plane with the Louis V luggage
Yellow diamonds same color as mustard
Blue diamonds same color the tarheels
Red diamonds like the section where Game live

Knee deep in the game

60 Gs I spent just for tellin' the time
I'm the hood homeboy
The ghetto trophy
Niggas hatin' on me so I can't stay focused
I smoke a nigga like a pack of them newports
Middle of the mall right in front of the food court
I might look gravy, but I'm smokin' that kushy
I'm not a killer, but you pussies done pushed me
I'm tryna live I ain't tryna die
So I'd rather your momma cry then my momma cry (bitch)

Nigga tell me when you piss do you sit or do you stand?
See my momma bring the drama
My daddy tote a llama
I learned from my momma so I hit him with the thunder
I coulda been dead, but im still breathin'
Do I smell pussy? Naw that's Jeezy!

Cupcake cornflake, nigga you too fake

Jeezy is the appetizer, you'll be the entrée

I fell in love, I fell in love
 chopper 

I fell in love, with selling drugs
Turned fifteen, dropped out the porch, then I ran it up
Beat some murder charges, fifty racks, and all dubs
Playing with the birds, in the kitchen, cooking dub
I'm a trap-a-holic, no after  I'm balling
Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, cooking what-ya-ma-call-it
Nasty with the wrist, cooking shiney 
Yello diamonds got me looking like 
In the pot with the whites, I ain't color 
In the trap with glass, mathematics
I met Ben Franklin, 
Married to the money, just bought that ho a Range
You know I keep that white, same color 
Twin-turbo  sitting on them things
When you talking traps, nigga we the kings
Put a hole in your head like Krispy Kreme

Lookin' for that right girl, fell in love with drugs
I'm a bad influence, have you fucking with that white girl
Boy, you need a fix, Imma sell that shit for thirty-six
Super stupid swag, fuck a bag 
Go with the work in the cab
Act funny, and we whippin' your ass
I got to get to the cash
With a hundred goons, with a Glock and a mask
I'm balling on niggas, I knew I would
Smoking on strong instead of wood
Original squad, and that's a fact
Fucking with Gucci, you know you good
Man, you talking on your TV
You got me missing the 
Videos I got on BET
Show you that I still be in the hood
Boy you scared, you don't come around
Stopped menacing, now you ain't feeling good?
This might be out of your range
You need to go back to Hollywood
And I'll come serve you in Hollywood
Fell in love with that paper
So much white on my hands
Like I got the Michael glove with this paper
In this squad we trust, you better mob with us
You better not shop with them
They got it all from us
And I get you 
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to hustling, and I fell in love

Mo money, I fell in love
Why we know you selling drugs?
Bitch got hella plugs
 don't tell them 
 don't settle 
They just tryna sell 
Keep that shotgun with us, just like Elmer Fudd
Keep that white for them niggas,  don't test your luck
See when we mention Dunk, he ain't dead to us
We ain't regular
We ain't got them bitch 
I was getting bitches fore I dropped a mixtape
Push, I give a fuck bout what a bitch say
This is national fuck your friend day
You don't speak of the payso, I don't 
Dead presidents 
I be working while you using all your sick days
That's why we look like the Falkins where Michael Vick plays
You can ask my nigga Green, but his shit made
From the ghetto like them bitches with them big brades
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to hustling, and I fell in love
I'm selling dubs, I'm selling dubs
Got my eyes on that white girl, and fell in love

Partner everything count
Even when I spit my verse bitch I make everything bounce
I'm a young gangster for sure, so these pussy niggas pout
Cause I'm steady busting moves in the middle of the drought
Hey this a power hitter, money getter in your face
And I ride with that tool, don't make me put it in your face

Listen To The Track Bitch!

I got this party started, ready for the mike like a starving artist
And I’m hard to start it
I’m a mad man, ask yelawolf I need a straight jacket
So I gave her just what Gucci mane tried to get you to take
(That white girl is a freak)
I pass that bitch to yell, he pass that back to me (HOLIDAY SEASON!!)

I’m too turnt up that I’m turnt out
I’m so burnt up, my lungs burnt out
I smoke too much, my crew smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out (Holiday seaasonnn, Flocka!!)
I’m too turnt up that I’m turnt out
I burn too much, my crew burnt out
I smoke too much, my roof smoked out
I ball too much, we just balled out

Elevator kush got me leaning like the Eiffel tower
I’m dreaming of a plate of powder
These pills got me tripping, I’m tripping
I missed my prescription, I’m slippin'
I’m a mad man, ask yelawolf I need a straight jacket
But I’m balling out and you ain’t in my task bracket
7 is the key, that white girl is a freak, I pass that bitch to yela', he pass that back to me
I came in with Irene, I’m leaving with Codeine
I need to take a chill pill and retreat from the scene
But I’ma take a stand until my drugs here, you dig
I purchase them to use em so guess what Gucci mane did …

I guess I'm more like my dad than I thought I was
And I need more in fact
I run to the store like I had a job moppin up
Another party popping up, drink till I drop my cup
Sink gettin all stopped up
From the blunt guts, smokers on the porch
With the bong full of bud And the kegs pumped up
Yeah that’s right, cocaine got these boys scratching they head like a head of lice
Bad luck on the floor with a bitch when I thought I had a hit, but instead it was a dike
So I gave her just what Gucci mane tried to get you to take
Soon as it set in, she came in with a twin and let off the breaks
I got this party started, ready for the mike like a starving artist
And I’m hard to start it, when its all said and done, and the confetti runs out then you can just point the party at me...
Yeah that, yeah that’s me
Yeah that's daddy's pedigree
Drop a mothafukin verse readily, ain't none of them ahead of me
Yeah catfish billy, shoulda just called me "cept fo three"
Cuse I take a thirty two pack of brew and crush em.. except for 3
Save them for the light weights, the 115’s in the skinny jeans
And I’ll be the king of the scene, the scene with the jim beam, beam

Face card, face card
Why use your bank card when you can use your face card?!

Club owners remember my face
Parked my car in front of the place
No one interrupting my space
And I ball hard cause I got racks in my safe
Eat so good I got to say Grace
Girls wanna fuck me on the first date
What I'm gon' do with all these big faces
New Gucci boots but fuck the shoe laces
Smoking on purp that smell just like grapes
And I don't smoke mid, I don't like the taste
Buy my ace of spades by the case and I don't have to pay I just use my face

Face card, face card
Why use your bank card when you can use your face card?!

Grass cut, so I see the snakes
Hoes congregate like I'm T.D. Jakes
Bitches fuck with me they know that I'm straight
And the plug give me cakes on strength of my face
Count to save a ho go put on your cape
I fucked her in the face and put her in place
Im good anywhere for you its not safe
And I keep a big pistol right on my waist
Sipping on lean then drunk me two Ace
Whole sixteen I can't feel my face
And they just let me out, murder was the case
Had a shiny suit on like Puffy and Ma$e

I know God can't be mad at me
Because all the blessing he gave me!
Riding around with my top down I’m looking up at the galaxy (stars)
A lot of girls can’t stand me, They don’t really understand me
Can’t get half of my Phantom, Can’t get half of my mansion
Lost my homie to gunfire, Nigga part of my empire
Ever since that day I’ve been riding late like a vampire
People say I’m a addict, got a lot of bad habits (true)
I love smoking that broccoli, and I love stacking that cabbage
Shout out to my jeweler, Damn it’s such a good jeweler
Shout out to my shooter, Damn he’s such a good shooter
Every car that I ride, Clean from bumper to bumper
Every time that I slide, Throw my top in the dumpster
I’m OG, yous a youngster, Got more guns then contra
More chains than Busta, and more hoes then Usher
It’s Gucci Mane and Drumma, So that means more commas
I’m hands on like a laptop, Get your cap popped this summer (Gucci)

Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I feel bad
I be in the hood, Might do a drive-by
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by

I catch it for a summer, Aggravated assault
Winter time niggas come out with 20 dimes
Feel like I’m on a shroom, All this money in this room
Friday night lights, Chain still swinging
I’m a rock star, and I’m gang banging
Skulls everywhere, Spikes everywhere
Bloodhound for that money, Catch me anywhere
I went to space and left some niggas
I don’t fucking care
I should have went to Yale, The way I move a bail
Death before dishonor, I’ll never tell

Mind gone with a foreign chick
With a Tech-9 with a cooling kit
Got the black jeans with the wings on 'em
Gucci shoes, no shoe-strings
Shit, every word means two things
So the white girl is my boo thang
And I'll come in due time, in the drop head at the blue flame
And I don't like to see no new faces
Cause I don't like to learn no new names
I go to sleep in foreign places
Wake up, count big faces
Stuff cash in suitcases, pillowcases, I'm two-faced

Last night went too hard on that ecstasy
And if I see that bitch tonight I never met the chick

Got a crazy whip game, I'm talkin' reckless bitch
Fucked up a 9 and a 4 tryn' to perfect the shit
I'm getting real good with it I got extra bricks
I got Canary yellow stones in my necklace
And when I walk in the club exit my foes exit it
Chop make your head spend around like the exorcist

When I first started back in 1995
I wasn't moving keys, I was buying 1.5's
I started coming up, junkies recognized my face
Paid a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case
They used to run up on me be like, "Gucci, what you know?"
I tell them, "Get this glass, and get the fuck away from me ho!"
And everywhere I go, it became an instant cut
Cause they knew had them 20's and them big fat monkey nuts

Can't be scared of the dark when you come from Mountain Park
Shooting dice and playing cards, selling blow all at the park
Had a crush on your sister, but I used to serve your mama
Breaking 50s down to dimes was my job for the summer
And my job for the winter cooking bricks all in the kitchen
Junkies dead at the car wash cause I heard that they was snitching
Dope jumping out the gym, man it helped me buy my Timbs
Dope fiend Willie used to finger fuck my rims
Smokers didn't know my name so they used to call me Black
If you beep me for a 20, bet ya I'mma call you back
She on the dope man dick cause I'm a nigga with a sack
I'm the hustler of the year, and I know that for a fact

Middle of the summer, bruh I'mma make it snow

8-Ball jacket and a pair of Stan Smiths

18 when a nigga bought his first 9
If I'm lying, I'm flying, and I show ain't flying
Cooking up dope cause the J's keep buying

Hello. This is the Exec Banker 6050 Money Counter
It can tell you the value of the bills counted as well as the piece count
All you have to do is tell it what denomination you’re counting and it gives you both value and piece count
Ok, I’m gonna turn the machine on by pressing the button in the rear
By the way, this machine can be 220 volts or 110, so if you need it with European power please let us know
As you can see after it comes on a nice big video screen lights up…

Jacuzzi on the roof, ugly hoes don't get the time of day
Chiefin' on sativa, smell the reefer from a mile away
Pistol in my coupe, try my troops, you'll get blown away

Ferrari with them bumble-bee, Forgiato sitting up under it
(How many carats in that bracelet, baby?)
I think about 200
Plus I hit the club with 50K, let's keep this shit 100
Got a couple houses, several spouses
In my penthouse, smoking ounces
Came up selling keys and ounces
Half a pound, white, gold, and brown
My pants sag, grands weigh 'em down
Used to catch the train to go downtown
Just to walk around and window shop
Now I shut the mall down every time
Every time that I hit the scene
Fresher than I wanna be
Cover of the magazine
Back of the limousine
Stacks in my denim jeans, hoes gon' remember me
458 ship to me from Italy
612 sitting outside the facilities
9-1-1, Gucci ice game killin' me
Came a long way from drug dealing
Waking up rich is a great feeling
Couple million stashed for my grandchildren
Just hand count a mill', coupe half million
Up on 'em, pull up on 'em
Like a bird, drop low and shit on 'em
Piss on 'em , spit on 'em
Tell them haters, Gucci got rich on 'em

'Cause it’s a tragedy how clear these diamonds blingin' in my ear
It's so many wanna marry me, I'm married to the game
Cocaine put me in position, swagger brought me all the fame
I need accountants to help me count it, Rolls-Royce, I mount it
Corvette painted candy, drop the top and bitches crowd it
Houses in Zone 6, all my niggas hustlers and robbers
Don't fuck with us, you'd be better off fucking off with angel dust
I'm racked up like a pool table
Stay draped up and purple label
Drank purple drank, smoke purple weed
Got a purple car and long paper
Every day thank the Lord that I wake
Every day living like my last day
Shine so bright rock stupid ice
More carats in my chain than a carrot cake
Money short, he runnin' out
I'm bussin' out, can't close the vault
Ain't my fault, It's yo' fault
Nobody stays here, this my money's house
Stash house, stocked up
Try to fuck shit, get chopped up
I'm rocked up, stay blocked up
I ain't locked up, but I'm guaped up

All you have to do, it’s ready to go, is take your bills in flat and drop them in flat like you would on a tabletop
Very easy to use, it counts through and it says, “25”
Now if I take these bills and put them in again, it starts over at zero again and says, “25” again
However, if I push the add button, now, if I drop them in it’s gonna start where it left off and continue
Now, it says, “50”, drop them in again, it’s going to say “75…”

Swag jumped overboard
Call the coast guard
Yellow, black Ferrari
Pull up in my Landshark
Yeah, my homies got more tools than a BrandsMart
Have 'em knockin' on your door like your landlord
Question of the day: What car are you gonna drive today?
Money's not a problem, I'm booked up 'till the month of May
Million dollar man, call me Gucci Dibiase
Every week, come to the mall, rein'-up Versace
So if you hatin' on Gucci Mane, gon' and get in line
No matter what you drivin', don't park your car next to mine
And if you can't see all these diamonds, then you colorblind
Looked at my watch to check the time, it told me "time to shine"

Diamonds dancin' on my hand, do the James Brown
Smokin' kush straight out the pound, I need to change towns
'Rari crawlin' down the street like a centipede
Ballin' like I'm in the league, but I'm not in the league
Got Jamaicans, and they cut that weed down by the tree
Fuck who it profit if that shit don't profit me
26's got the donk lookin' like it got hydraulics
So, if you ain't talkin' money, nigga, change the topic
Go for it, go for it
Tell her somethin' good

My posse on Bouldercrest
Mike WiLL Made-It, Gucci Mane slayed it

Me and my gang at home away from home
In a all-red Phantom, in the backseat on the phone
It's callin' up the posse, it's time to get rippin'
And if they get to trippin', then we shootin' like the Pistons
Everybody lookin', if you jealous, turn around
These twenty-six inches got us so high off the ground
The Forgiato rims, they're skinny as the tires
My system soundin' good, but I need the volume higher
The Mike-WiLL kick drum make the bitches get dumb
Rollin' Rolls-Royces, so the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this, these niggas wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate, the richest one in East Atlanta
Picked up the posse on 34 and Gresham
Headed up to Bouldercrest, we 'bout to start flexin'
The Phantom kind of crowded, the front was leanin' back
Scarr, he in the Birdie, got two bitches in his lap
On Martin Luther King, the set look kind of dead
We need a new street, so posse move ahead
We all drippin' in ice, the crew you can't forget
The So Icey Boys and we rippin' up the set

There's not another posse with more points scored
We stone cold criminals, we flex like big gorillas
We not the average artist, bitch, we certified killers
I spent a million dollars just for diamonds on my teeth
And every time they see 'em, make their girls get weak
People think we crazy, some think that we are funny
But it ain't hard to tell that we make a lot of money
We clockin' all the dollars, we rock a lot of gold
The other crews mad 'cause we fuckin' all they hoes
Woodland, Custer Ave, me and my crew are thugs
And they so full of drugs they may never sober up
And I'm a dope man and the pack just dropped
If you ain't tryna cop, then this Phantom won't stop
At Boulevard and Moreland the driver broke left
And Shiesty shouted "Bouldercrest, it's time to get def"
My girl blew me a kiss, she said I was the best
She's lookin' mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse on Bouldercrest, it's time to get ill
Certified, I'm that lil' nigga that make big ones pay respects
CGE, 1017, covered in choppas and baguettes
We just flipped one of they niggas, tryna see who gon' be next
Soon as I burn up this steamer, take me where I parked the 'Vette
Why he keep talkin' like he gangster? Cook him, put him to the test
My opps don't never show they background, know I'll send some' where they at
Them pigs can ask a million questions, still won't get me to say shit
It ain't no tellin' who got shot, if you don't know, you never slid
And they can't act like they don't know me, remember I flew out your bitch
I take they Rollies and their chains, nigga, I'm the reason you hide your wrist
For real menace, been causin' hell, I done did shit you can't forget

Ain't no quarters, ain't no halves, just some wholes in 'dis house

I can't neva keep no bitch 'cause I put them hoes out
I was corner store and in the motel in it, selling it
You can check my rap sheet, its numerous felonies
I took twenty-three stacks, and bought some jet skis
Have pity for the cop who gotta arrеst me
A front street, jump street, then jump out, it's a track meet
Use to havе a ten-speed, now I got a Bentley

Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down (We Heavy in the Streets, boy)

Need 4, I need more, another whore
Get another one
Gucci Mane La Flare, big diamonds, I could smother one
 cover one
I'm the governor
And I got a Ferrari, 

I jumped off the porch, yeah I jumped off early
And I started sellin' birdies
My stash so big that a nigga can't serve me
Unless a nigga servin' birdies3Embed
I'm thinkin' back when a nigga got his first car
"How you get that? You ain't even have a job"
Fight about that, and don't worry 'bout that
It's the same way that a nigga got his first charge
Thinkin' way back so I'm thinkin' real hard
Sellin' hard hard at Econo Lodge
Bought my first pistol and I knocked my first broad
First nigga run up, head get knocked off
Bought a .38 just in case shit pop off
Like a 'vert', I'ma take your top off
Brick Squad CEO, bitch I'm a mob boss
.44 bulldog, million dollar drop off
If I ever get this drop I'ma start lickin' shots
Tell the cops I'm just another nigga from the block
You can gamble with your life like a lady at the slots
You can plot 'til you pop and your clock get stopped
You were flexin' what you got, now your head got a dot
You're the nigga in the paper that they're readin' about
Police still ain't connected the dots
Drug  cause I left a nina at the house
Take me to the safe cause I'm cleanin' it out
Hundred bricks what I've been dreamin' about
Slap you with the , see the blood and the snot
Laced up 'til your hands tied in a knotYou might also like1Embed

Sipping on that Actavis you sipping Robitussin

I'm turned up now, I can’t turn round
I wish theres some way that I can turn back time
I’ve learned my lesson, I’ve served my time
I had so many turns, I lost so much time
I used to serve everybody now I'm a turn them down
So when ya turn come better turn up wise
Never turn my back, I can turn some round
And I can take a wrong turn  ‘cause I’m on my grind

I hope my momma pray everyday, I don’t got to prison
They say my little boy was deaf, but when I talk why he listen
I might buy me 50 bricks and just get back in the business
How I was raised you can’t come in, just can't come into the kitchen
Scooter signed with Gucci Mane, that was a better decision
I know Future mad but man, that shit there come with the business
I got so much money on me I can't hold up my britches
Georgia aquarium type of nigga man I fuck with them fishes
I don’t give a nigga one chance to fuck with my riches
And I can’t have no stylist round me, I don’t fuck with no sissies
And if you dissin’ me then diss me and be very specific
And I’m not dissin’ I’m just talking numbers, grams and statistics
Its Gucci

Listen to this track, bitch

I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died, and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
(It’s Gucci)
So I don’t turn around no more, I look at whats in front of me
I’m focused on the future 'cause yesterday is history

A hard head makes a soft ass
Guess your Ma didn't teach ya that
Pick a spot to beef with me and that spot I will meet you at
Well let me check my schedule
I’m free Tuesday three weeks from now
You bring your crew I bring my crew
Just pick a time and side of town
Zone 6 is my stomping ground
But I guess you know that by now
But everywhere you go you hear me
That's why you're upset right now
Bought a Phantom and a Lamb' but I’m in my 'Vette right now
I raped the game without a rubber, bank accounts are pregnant now
That day they tried to murder me, a day I can’t forget about
And I don't wish no death on homie
Just want him to hear me out
Think about the past and all the many things we talked about
Think of all the people influenced by what comes out our mouth

I am not the perfect person
May don’t spit the perfect verses
I wouldn’t hurt a girl on purpose 'cause I feel they don’t deserve it
I admit my words can hurt, I dissed Tiny she didn’t deserve it
Our song didn’t interpret it right and I’m sorry for it
T.I. many times encouraged, told me face the game with courage
Clay gave me some great advice and still today I thankful for it
Me, Jeezy, and T.I share one thing in common: all are poets
Role model to young people tho at times man we still ignore it
And y’all gon owe respect to me and I don’t like apologies
Just diss me 'til you satisfied
I swear it doesn’t bother me
Sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets won't reflect off me
But words and insults only show the world how y'all respectin' me
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy

All my homies ain’t my homies
Half friends no longer want me
I'm still hungry as I was when I did my first live performance
Things I got I know they want it
Things I done, they haven’t done it
Though they say that they my friends
I know that these niggas opponents
We can joke and laugh and party
But I know their smiles are phony
But I still pray that the Lord give 'em all the things they wanted
All the money in the world can’t get the joy I’m felling, homie
Like the third day with a woman like you and not for your money
You can help someone and love someone but still they'll turn and burn you
So I warn you in advance, watch out cause so called friends will con you
Think MJG said it best man will I ever know
Who my friends through thick and thin, cause so called friends will turn to foes
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history

Head shaking with the pilot cause she trafficking the Keisha

She so ready to fuck she tried to do it by herself
I told her that's Versace, watch how you pulling on that belt
And these is Christian Loub, now that's a rack every time I step
I'm with Longway, I'm with Jeff
Just poured up eight up by myself
Pull up in that foreign feature 'rari, hop out and just sit
Touchdown in LA, 1017, God they on jets
I seen Guwop call up Birdman, told 100k a bet
Why every time you see the kid I'm with another nigga's bitch?
All my shooters play with choppers, you can tell they with the shit
I don't give a fuck about her, she'll get fucked then get dismissed
Smoking weed and sipping lean, designer down behind the tent3Embed
I got money stacked
Like dirty clothes
I love the kids
But I don't love the hoes
Fuck wit ya, boi
Shop wit ya folks
She say she love me
But she just love rolls
I got money stacks
Like dirty clothes
And I don't love her
She love my dirty dros
And if the game slow up
I'm back to flipping  O's
And I got bricks of blow
And sixty pounds of dope

R.I.P to my old hoes, say hello to my new friends
Bad chick with the red bottoms, we pull up in a brand new Benz
Foolish whip like Shawty Lo
I got foolish money, little shorty knows
My money growing like a Chia pet, our first date Lenox Mall
Our second date was shrimp & steak, our third date was hella great
Hella money, I sell hella weight
I got a big estate, with a huge lake
Helicopter with a pilot, Maybach with a driver
Bedroom with a kitchen in it, might wake up and cook a nine up
Or a deuce up for a four way
Got short money, it's no play
Got fifty pounds off that gas pack
You can smell this shit from the driveway
Sold this shit in like two days, been waiting on it like nine days
I'm a trap nigga, street living legend
Get my grass cut by like nine jays

Got a bank-roll, no pressure

If ya knew better do better
I'm a go-getter, I'm a gorilla
She ain't do nothin' if I ain't let her

My dog, you got thirty years and he gon' appeal
I don't need a deal, cause I cash out on the regular
I don't do no debit cards, I don't fuck with creditors
All I do is talk money, cause Gucci got et cetera
Killed all my competitors, so ain't nobody better, bruh
Baby girl ain't regular, a normal nigga's scared of her

No shirt on just a wife-beater
Quicker on the draw than an art teacher
Talking out loud like proud preachers
Pistol in my arm-reacher
King-sized swisher with some nice reefer
Hood are a-smashing the white people
Me on your track, that's a nice feature
Tats on my face like nine needles
Scratch like a nigga got nine heaters
No national, the Grand National
Bitches sucking me like Dracula
Flipping these hoes like spatulas
Coming down the hill, it's spectacular
Control the rock and unload the crop
And get it out soon as you hit the loading dock
Barbershop, cause of the shady boss
Bitch I'm back so good you couldn't tell or not

Stretching pain out on myself, last night I was whiling out
Took so much damn Ace of Spades, woke up on somebody's couch
Now I'm 'bout to throw a party. Who party right at the house?
Though I smoke at least half an ounce, so many blunts that I lost count
Now I'm wasted, loaded, bitch crazy, drunk, high, landed, rolling
Talking like a loco-motive, tell 'em four pounds' the quota
She hoping going blowing on pussy-ness that's so explosive
House white with steel, ho I'm not a man to show no emotion
I got pornographic pictures in my iPad
Oh that's your bitch? I fucked her, nigga. My bad!
So if you fuck my girl, we'll be even Steven

In the last minute I done thought about you ten times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside
And every since she left it's like my heart died

Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said, "How you don't you trust me, you did a homicide?"
Then said, "I got a boyfriend who I can't put aside
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side."
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came back
Baby girl so bad, diss me but I ain't mad
Why you wanna tease me?
You should wanna squeeze me
Homie ain't the kid, baby he could never be me

(Well damn!)
Once upon a time a long time ago
I had a bitch but she felt she had to let me go
Called me and then she came by and said, "Shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch."
But now when I see her shorty whole swag switched
I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit
(Well damn!)
That's not Gucci, baby that's floochy
Remember 2000 you was acting all boujee
9 years later and you're best friend choosing
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies
Gucci don't gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want,that's when she fantasized
Told her I can't talk to her cause I got that man pride
Ever since I left baby girl told me her heart died (Gucci!)
Baby, you don't have to treat me all anti

Excuse me if I sound a little crazy
But just wanna be good to my baby
Cause he been holding me down
And putting it down
He give me everything I don't need no one around
But you're saying you can give it to me better
Get me hot like it's July and I'm rocking a sweater
Just for hitting the road
Would you women let go
Say you got 20/20
Her man's 2004
Maybe I'll give you a try
And keep it low
I could let you ride
Something like a test drive
See baby I ain't so anti
Baby, you don't have to treat me all anti

Hello. This is the Exec Banker 6050 Money Counter
It can tell you the value of the bills counted as well as the piece count
All you have to do is tell it what denomination you’re counting and it gives you both value and piece count
Ok, I’m gonna turn the machine on by pressing the button in the rear
By the way, this machine can be 220 volts or 110, so if you need it with European power please let us know
As you can see after it comes on a nice big video screen lights up…

Jacuzzi on the roof, ugly hoes don't get the time of day
Chiefin' on sativa, smell the reefer from a mile away
Pistol in my coupe, try my troops, you'll get blown away
Gucci Mane got long money, bitch, that's all I got to say

Got a money tree, I drown the bitch with money
Ferrari with them bumble-bee, Forgiato sitting up under it
(How many carats in that bracelet, baby?)
I think about 200
Plus I hit the club with 50K, let's keep this shit 100
Got a couple houses, several spouses
In my penthouse, smoking ounces
Came up selling keys and ounces
Half a pound, white, gold, and brown
My pants sag, grands weigh 'em down
Used to catch the train to go downtown
Just to walk around and window shop
Now I shut the mall down every time
Every time that I hit the scene
Fresher than I wanna be
Cover of the magazine
Back of the limousine
Stacks in my denim jeans, hoes gon' remember me
458 ship to me from Italy
612 sitting outside the facilities
9-1-1, Gucci ice game killin' me
Came a long way from drug dealing
Waking up rich is a great feeling
Couple million stashed for my grandchildren
Just hand count a mill', coupe half million
Up on 'em, pull up on 'em
Like a bird, drop low and shit on 'em
Piss on 'em , spit on 'em
Tell them haters, Gucci got rich on 'em
It's Gucci

Every city, I make magic, I make money disappear
'Cause it’s a tragedy how clear these diamonds blingin' in my ear
It's so many wanna marry me, I'm married to the game
Cocaine put me in position, swagger brought me all the fame
I need accountants to help me count it, Rolls-Royce, I mount it
Corvette painted candy, drop the top and bitches crowd it
Houses in Zone 6, all my niggas hustlers and robbers
Don't fuck with us, you'd be better off fucking off with angel dust
I'm racked up like a pool table
Stay draped up and purple label
Drank purple drank, smoke purple weed
Got a purple car and long paper
Every day thank the Lord that I wake
Every day living like my last day
Shine so bright rock stupid ice
More carats in my chain than a carrot cake
Money short, he runnin' out
I'm bussin' out, can't close the vault
Ain't my fault, It's yo' fault
Nobody stays here, this my money's house
Stash house, stocked up
Try to fuck shit, get chopped up
I'm rocked up, stay blocked up
I ain't locked up, but I'm guaped up
It's Gucci

All you have to do, it’s ready to go, is take your bills in flat and drop them in flat like you would on a tabletop
Very easy to use, it counts through and it says, “25”
Now if I take these bills and put them in again, it starts over at zero again and says, “25” again
However, if I push the add button, now, if I drop them in it’s gonna start where it left off and continue
Now, it says, “50”, drop them in again, it’s going to say “75…”

I'm in the zone, they keep on getting offended
But I ain't did nothin wrong, but tighten up on my business
And now I'm making millions, everybodys' social
They really too emotional, I don't have time to hold em'
"I wanna be a billionaire," Me too
So I can count a billion cash in hundreds on Youtube
I get dirty money bitches bitches know it's ciroc on my rider
I'm on stage with Diddy, Nicki, Ricky Rozay and Flo-Rida
I rock Mauris without money, ball like Stoudemire, Amare
Hold the blunt with my left hand to show my Audemars in Paris
Look at all the I've accomplished, I just bought me 3 Ferraris
Spent 5 million in my company if offended you; Not sorry

What it gon' be?
What it ain't gon' be, too many chains on me, too many rings on me
Baby dancing on me, diamonds dancing on me cause my watch and my ring straight dancing on freeze

I'm a mathematician young street magician, and I keep on taking pretty girls to Lenox
New Mercedes with 80 in it, watch me spend all 80 in 80 minutes
Saks & Fifth, young true religion
Bought a car so sharp it make the feds suspicious
They say I'm too flamboyant, I say they're malnutritioned
I'm in a rare edition, I think Le Mans edition
Dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got a dime on my line asking
What it gon' be? What you gon' do Gucci, when you gon' leave?
Still popping bottles pouring liquor on chicks; no need to lie I'm such a freak
No need to hide, you so unique I'mma try to beat ya back down til' you weak
Say you ran out of money then more for me, here's more for you, cause you a whore for me

These girls petrified, almost scared to speak
I'm in a new GT with the Georgia peach
Got a condo right off the Florida beach, It ain't hard to reach, so nice to meet
Every night with me you probably fight with me
Sex fight on me and spend the night with me
No rules, everything alright with me, nice shape baby
Shaped just right for me
Catch ball players in magic city show them boys how good my jumper is
Making all pros look like amateurs
I just showed my ass last night I had a blast
My jewelry was so bright haters put theirs in the trash
Pulled up in something fast just to make them haters mad
Rims with the paper tag, paper bag full of cash

Cause I'm a grown-ass man

Now that I'm finally free

I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Super high, can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
Streets taught me everything, I trained myself
Dead wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else
They wanna lock my crew up like ???
Think every man ??? and amuse himself
Glad as well, but I'm mad as hell
Because my best friend probably gon' die in jail
Ain't no lie to tell, probably cry like hell
If I dwell on it, cause he got 80 years
I'm going hard, you see I might as well
Cause I got a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy's dead
I bet my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag
So I stand today, then get down to pray
The second is now and my mind is made
I got a point to prove, and a son to raise

All the money in the world can't bring that back
If I had one wish, wish mom and dad could
Come down now and see me rap
But she see me now, and I believe in that
On the strength of that I ain't goin' back

Do you remember when I met you girl everything was alright
Do you remember when we got a room we was fucking all night
Do you remember the time, girl?
Like I remember the time, girl

Girl you my type, you just right
That blouse on you fit just right
Them jeans she got on skin-tight
She sexy, cool, but still shy
I'm colder than a Klondike
My polar I got dumb ice
We know each other, we go together
Like hamburgers and french fries
Everything is alright
We'll never have a fist fight
But last night had a sex fight
Then told her have a blessed night
I'm leanin', I'm meanin'
I fall asleep might have dreams in it
Hit the club and bring my team in it
Not tonight, I'mma bring my queen in it
I go get it, you bullshitters
I hit it, damn right that kid did it
You hood critics and hood chickens
Please try to stay out my business
From south France to south Philly
ATL to North Memphis
From my city, to your city
Think you got more swag but not really

But when I'm gone it'll make you want mo'
Scented oils and candles
I pull up in my Lambo
The bestest that you never had
Two backstreets off the main road
You had her but she left so
That's just the way the game go
No one on my level so get up out my lane ho
I met a girl so real that it's no need to run no game on
Reminisce of Gucci every time they play my same song
I'm on her like a long john
Short skirt with no thongs on
Sexy naked sunbathin' outside my house with frames on
I took her for some buster and that boy ain't gon' do shit about it
It's alright if we kick it, tell that sucker forget about it

Girls to my right, ladies to my left

Remember back rubs and pink champagne

Mr. Davis has a— a history
You know, we're not gonna skirt that issue
A judge ordered a well-known Atlanta rapper handcuffed and taken to jail today

But these VVS diamonds make me feel like Meech
I had a pistol in the club the first day I met Weezy
AR in the car the first day I met Jeezy
When I first started dissing niggas it was just teasing
Glock 40 on my hip, it was just me and Mac Bre-Z

Killers waiting in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a dub and told him fire ya ass up
It seem like everywhere you go, somebody try yo ass up
I got real money nigga, I can buy my own luck
Headshots, headshots
All my young niggas aiming headshots
Headshots, headshots
Put a dub on your head, headshots

So this is the end of the story

Start selling weed for my brother, the age was eleven
Thirty off a hundred dollars he working the shipments
Seventh grade Christmas time, momma gave me a fifty
I spent that fifty with the dope man, he gave me two fifties
I owed a fifty but I trapped and I paid him so quickly
I had them dimes so big junkies callin' me biggie
I moved out, paying rent was such a good feeling
I hit a lick, thirty grand fell out of the ceiling
I’m in Savannah and my nigga like king of the city
In Alabama with them hammers they plotting to get me
These suckers tried to take my life on a couple occasions
Been grinding hard, thirty years, never took a vacation
And ever since seventeen, been stuck on probation
I chased a nigga, stabbed his ass now they calling me Jason
I fell out with my homeboy, I swear it was crazy
And we don't really know each other, but having a baby
I travelled all around the world been plenty of places
I'm Gucci, trashbag cash got plenty of faces
In Sun Valley, trapping hard like back in the Eighties
I leave with eighty, spend at least thirty grand in the station
I lost my nigga Dunk and no one will ever replace him
In Gucci's eyes he will always be one of the greatest
I lost my nigga Dunkin and no one will ever replace him
In Gucci's eyes he will always be one of the greatest

The streets will give it to you and the streets will take it
Every nigga in the streets got no patience

I got young niggas in the hood that'll kill your ass for 50 dollars
Holla red rock if you scared, nigga I ain't never hollered
Don't be bothered I strapped the C4 right to you father
Pipe Bomb taped to a toddler
No I'm not an infant but I got a bunch of baby bottles
For instance, I back doored a nigga in The Ramada
The distance from Florida to Georgia is farther
My amigos is still sending bales across the border
Off the boat bitch I swear she look like she came out the water
It's BrickSquad 1017 and ain't no niggas harder!

A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen (I've never seen)
A bitch I can't catch I will never see (I'll never see)
She come around me, she won't wanna leave (won't wanna leave)
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The feel so strong, make you breach a tear
The smoke so strong, higher down the tree

I'm a Success story, take a look at my journey
In a trap house full of niggas, tryna get them some money
Remix, fix fake bails, pills and dummies
RIP my uncle Sunny and my homeboy Lonny
I trick so many people, should go church on Sunday
But I would be a hypocrite because the work come Monday
I grew up so fucked up, that's I'm oh so cunning
And I can honestly tell you niggas that I'm so dishonest
Let's give a shout out to the ducks, in the world I punish
You think Gucci give a fuck, you got one thing coming
If you's a buster, me and you have nothing in common
Trap house, stash house, all I rap bout money
It's Gucci

She walked out, she bitched out
She suck the dick non-stop
I think I hit the jackpot
She act out, she ashed out
We ranned out, you're handout
Rappers say they stand out
But yet they got they hand out
If trap music ain't hip-hop
Then Gucci Mane ain't hip-hop
Humble county grow houses then we have a great crop
Hard in the paint trap but nigga I can blake out
They shorted me 300, But I served his ass a shake ounce
A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen (I've never seen)
