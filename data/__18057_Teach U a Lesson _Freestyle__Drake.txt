20 ContributorsTeach U a Lesson (Freestyle) Lyrics
Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'Cause mine's it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like
You might also like
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go

You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You work it off (work it off)
Baby I can give you extra credit (extra credit)
But there's something else
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's 'cause you're hidin' WMD's
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby, you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it mine?
Can I love you all my life?4Embed
