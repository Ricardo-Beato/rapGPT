Tell me what you need, bitch, you know a young nigga got it
Pills to the weed, Poppy Street, niggas 'bout that profit
I'm the dopeman, out here serving dope to niggas' mommas
I'm the dopeman, tell me what you need, I got thatâ€”

I don't need a gun just to melt a nigga brain
I could pull up to the slums with a quarter-ki of caine
I'm the dopeman
I'm the dopeman
I can get you high, baby, I don't need a plane
You should hurry up and buy, 'cause we selling everything
I'm the dopeman
I'm the dopeman, get with the program
Get with the program

Alright, alright, alright, we gonna do it just like this! I need a kilo of everything you motherfucking got! We tryna set it off! Crack, coke...

Spending summer days selling hay (Hay)
Spending summer nights selling white (White)
Feds setting traps on the A
Yams had the Act' in the ice
Alright, tryna make a dollar bill
Don't hide, pay me mine and get your mama killed
What you need? What you got? Making plays
'Til I'm laid in the grave, getting paid
You might also like
I don't need a gun (Gun)
Just to melt a nigga brain (Brain)
I could pull up to the slums (Slums)
With a quarter-ki of 'caine ('Caine)
I'm the dopeman (Dope, I'm the man)
I'm the dopeman (Dope, I'm that man)
I can get you high (High)
Baby, I don't need a plane (Plane)
You should hurry up and buy (Buy)
'Cause we selling everything (Everything)
I'm the dopeman (Dope, I'm the man)
I'm the dopeman, get with the program (Dope, I'm the man)
Get with the program11Embed
