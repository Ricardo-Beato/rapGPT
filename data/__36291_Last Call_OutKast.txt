24 ContributorsLast Call Lyrics
To them niggas that be holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call
To them motherfuckers holding the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call

Now look here
I'm gon' hit the club, man, I'm gon' get some love
I'm the coolest nigga, ain't gon' spend more than a dub
I'm gon' tell that broad and her chicken head friend
No Ferrari, no Jag', no Bentley, or no Benz
Might just play the wall with this mean look on my grill
Act like I'm the hater, the Haitian from Hateville
I remember her, act like she don't remember me
When I was Cadillac-in', Coupe Deville-in', chickenhead drillin'

To them niggas that be holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (Ayy)
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
To them motherfuckers holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (Ayy)
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call
You might also like
I'm gon' get that fresh-fly fade and then I'm gon' get laid
Like some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon' get paid
Makin' a early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay
The dirty don has informed me the drought has ended today
With no delay
And a four-piece grizzle, we on our way
For a brief stay in a sweet place for a petite face to lay (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

To them niggas that be holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (Ayy)
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
To them motherfuckers holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (Ayy)
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call

Them boys so wild, don't crack no smile
Closet like the Wild Kingdom, fox, minks, and crocodiles
Popped tops on what we drink, so sit back for a while
Matter fact, light that and I'll be right back
They want a couple more bottles, I got somethin' for 'em to swallow
Anybody ever told you you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit the hook, line, and follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'ma grind until tomorrow
They call me Mack Rapalicious and when I bubble, I blow trouble up in your ear
They call me Mack Rapalicious and when I bubble, it's trouble all up in you, dear
To them niggas that be holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (Ayy)
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
To them motherfuckers holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (Ayy)
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call

Yes, I know the way excite them hoes
Me cold reptilian feet bite them hoes
Got a partner, oh, his mind sick
He say he love this old coke-strung-out stripper bitch
Why he so dumb? I'm so pimp, it's ridiculous
Got tinted windows on my ride, I'm inconspicuous
Run with this pretty thing, she ain't yours, you wish she was
We don't stop it, it's so repeated and continuous
Mello Capone, Don Huggy Bear, Pokey the fuckin' pimpolous
Ain't that cute? Slick 'em out they drawers, I'm so infamous
Dead serious
From the club to the Caddy to the Holiday Inn
From the dusk 'til the dawn, we gon' do it again

To them niggas that be holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (Ayy)
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
To them motherfuckers holdin' the wall, fuck y'all
Hit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all
What we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (Ayy)
We gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call2Embed
