Early morning
Early morning (commission it)
Early morning getting It
In the fucking kitchen
(It’s holiday season bitch)

Early Morning Getting It
Riding with the semi
Choppa touch your face
Make you look like stitches
Fonem Got the pigeons (the pigeons)
Flying through my kitchen (through my kitchen )
We come through with ravens
They die when we get them (when we get them )
Get up nigga don’t sit down (don’t sit down)
I just fucked your bitch (your bitch)
The category of stable (stable)
Now I ain’t there
I got monkey nuts
And I got help
The jailhouse rock
Base it up
Presley Elvis
You might also like
Early morning coke
Early morning pole
You early morning broke
I smoke early morning dope
I got early morning seats
Have a early morning feast
I got late night ounces and
Early morning piece
Hopped in my car and turn it off cause I need a massage
All the pussy ass niggas I’m a need a collage
I count my rolls  sticking near my nose
Right now motherfucking tired
And all I smalls everything besides my clothes gotta be a motherfucking law
Early morning Pole
Fonem bring the dope
I keep early morning phone calls
Early morning corn balls
How about the dough
Then they like he’s snorting ya’ll
I think  that I’m covered
Only thing  I know is ball
Think I’m Tiger Woods
All the things I know is golf
I Think I’m a rhino
Only thing I know is  throw
Put me in a top 10 quarterbacks of all time
I got me a salt of chopper
I got a me sharp knife
I got me some dumb bitches
I got me some smart ones too
Pistol nine eleven
Knock your homey down he follow you
You said you ain't with this shit like I spill drink it’s all on you
Like Snell challenge Jordan to a game, don't make me ball on you
Take an early morning pistol too
Where ‘s my spine, I feeling you
You feel my cousin Im billing you
Hilary 
Early morning cappin
And early morning traffic
Late night 22-3
Early morning mag10
Of early morning juice
I got early morning booze
I got late night rooms and early morning rooms
Like game play, I need early morning assists
And since I’m a asshole I take early morning shits

I got early morning lights
Late night lights
Like a baker who can’t bake, Boy your cake not right
When you go pick up  vanessa
And I grabbed Ronda
She was too busy singing
She want me to sign her
Like the horses
I got farmers
Now go set your reminder
Man run a errand, i got one in the fire
I swear this k
Shoot like it’s Kobe
I swear this de-e shoot like Ginobilli
I got the 30, Stephen Curry
I'm here for teaching
He here for learningEmbed
