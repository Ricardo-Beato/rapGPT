(Now hear dis)
(All original rudeboy)
Lick a shot
(Oh)
Comin' at ya
(Fire)

Zip-ah-dee-doo-dah, zip-ah-dee-ayy
Cried, "Oh my", wanna get that punk with my AK
And get on the way
On a mission, puffin' on a fat ass J
Prude, you can't hang
Flash back on the skills when I used to bang
On the corner, I'll warn ya, gonna roll on ya
Fool, hit ya with a golden rule
Don't turn your back on the street
When I hit that corner, feel the concrete
If ya push that by like nothin'
Watch me turn to a psycho all of a sudden
Blastin' at these fools with a passion
Look at the Glock when it's time for some action

Let the gat hum
(Lick a shot)
So I let the gat hum
Let the gat hum
(Lick a shot)
So I let the gat hum

Sunday morning, wake up, it's stormin'
Raindrops fallin' on my head, it's pourin'
Cats and dogs, pigs in a wagon
Lookin' for the Afro, one that's saggin'
Scooby-Doo, and fuck them too (Ploy me)
Don't let your punk ass try me
Gonna take more than you
Better call your backup team and wait for ya crew
I'm the one flippin', keepin' the clip on my hip
And just watch your back if you're slippin' (Ooh)
Where did that .22 come from?
When the bullet passed through my lung
I've lost my breath, I'm winded
I've been hit by a slug that wasn't intended
I hear thunder, I wonder
If a nigga like me's goin' under, take a number

Let the gat hum
(Lick a shot)
So I let the gat hum
Let the gat hum
(Lick a shot)
So I let the gat hum
Had a bad dream, woke up in a casket
Now I can't even get back at the bastard, bullshit
This pine box ain't strong enough to contain the Afro locks
Critical bell rings, snapped out the dream
What the fuck's up with the funny red beam
Pointin' at me? I got no strap G
What now? Gotta duck, they're gonna gat me
Bam, I feel numb
Where did the shotgun blast come from?

Let the gat hum
(Lick a shot)
So I let the gat hum
Let the gat hum
(Lick a shot)
So I let the gat humEmbed
