Let me tеll you a little somethin' about the Self (Tell 'em, Self)
I be a piece of the East Coast
So give a toast to Plug Wonder Why
Back in the day who soaked his words in ginger
So when I ran a phrase in June, you didn't catch it 'til December
I'm a member of them kids from the inner city
Givin' you kiddies audible treats, you be achin' for
Makin' more money than a pagan holiday
Not from the PJ's, yet I still got somethin' to sayYou might also likeEmbed
