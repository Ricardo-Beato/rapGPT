So special, it's so stressful
And no rest for the devil on a weekday
And I'll remember the first time I met you
I wasn't really punk rock, just a cheapskate
Go to sleep to the waves on the freeway
Wake up wasted, ain't nobody tryna see straight
Lookin' at me like I drove up in a pumpkin
But climbed inside like you're tryna find somethin'
If we lucky enough to get drunk and fall in love
Maybe decades later we could be arguin' for nothin'
The parts fit like a puzzle and all of a sudden
She let me put a couple Slugs in the oven
I put a ring around Saturn on a Saturday
Valentine's, so I took you on a valid date
Starin' up at the stars above a frozen lake
Maybe the stars are ghosts, it's hard to say
Either way the Milky way doesn't even feel far away
With your lips on my face and a car full of mixtapes

Just push play, don't even ask
Runnin' around in Minneap' like it's the whole map
From the bottom of the rock to the top of the trash
They tried to blow, but couldn't copy my jazz
And I'm tryna slow it down, soften the crash
But when I'm gone, I hope the last sound I heard was your laugh
The vanity plates say "Love Life"
But the look on your face say "Uptight"
I'm upright 'cause I ain't supposed to crawl
And then I, I held breath and dove into the fall
I'm not waitin' on death to write my name on the wall
I'd rather swim through the flood with a chain and a ball
The background took the shock of the tremor
Put the sad clown flag down, but not to surrender
I accept the challenge, got me lookin' at the mirror
Like, "I hear ya crystal clear, you're still here"
I'ma play my position 'til the end of existence
I made this new playlist, give it a listenYou might also likeEmbed
