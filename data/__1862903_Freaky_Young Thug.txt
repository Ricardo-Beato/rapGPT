She slime like the deacon, she slime like the deacon, yeah
Thugger Thugger, baby
Yeah

Ayy, I don't wanna tease it, I really wan' freak it
I'm Michael, I beat it, I'm keepin' your secret
I got more hoes than Pleasers, the one that's on Bleveland
She pull up and freak it, she pull up and freak it
I hop out the 'Rari, I'm leaving it started
Ayy, she got just a Harley and a star just like Hardee's
Ayy, you play with her garden, she smoke you like Marley
Ayy, now she be my darlin', yeah, she be my Barbie

I'm loving your pace, turtle in this race
Ooh, long as you don't play, motherfuck what you say
Hey, I'm on the third base and you away (That means I'm home)
Quan said, "Please have a phone", call it a day
I got my ice out the lake, killed that boy by a mistake
We eatin', where is your plate? Aim at your head or your face?
Hannah Montana, my nigga gon' cook everyday, yeah, they bake
Bitch, I been havin' them bricks and them bales late'
I apologize if I got more money than you and your clan
I apologize if I pull up in that new coupe wrapped in 'Ran
I apologize if I post a picture posted wit' some bands
I apologize if I go and grow me some pot in Japan
Where your bitch at? No, not that one
Baby want to touch my milk like she cowin'
Every time you see me, I'ma have thousands
On the island, no dressin'
I wan' taste it, you got no man, I hope you a free agent
And I'm a big old Blood inside that little ol' nation
You might also like
Ayy, I don't wanna tease it, I really wan' freak it
I'm Michael, I beat it, I'm keepin' your secret
I got more hoes than Pleasers, the one that's on Bleveland
She pull up and freak it, she pull up and freak it
I hop out the 'Rari, I'm leaving it started
Ayy, she got just a Harley and a star just like Hardee's
Ayy, you play with her garden, she smoke you like Marley
Ayy, now she be my darlin', yeah, she be my Barbie

Ayy, ho, what is your bargain? Bro, what is your bargain?
Ayy, I pull up and arson all over your garden
Ayy, I'm never gon' call you, I'm always gon' ball you
Ayy, my diamonds cost more than whatever I charge you
Now I'm bleedin', need a band-aid, on a rampage wit' them AKs
Nigga jewelry real gold like an Ace of Spades
Higher than a escalator any day
I'm a catch a bitch and fold her like a centipede
I ain't talkin' 'bout no coffee, she got double D's
These niggas fake-ballin' like a Powerade
Damn, this might be coward day
Yeah, this might be powder day
Sniff, shoot up, boot up (Toot up), TMZ, sue us
Even if you had Erykah Ba', you couldn't do us
But I got a whole lot of motherfuckin' guns, nigga, you can shoot us
Hey, and I ain't never been a rat, but I'm livin' ruthless
Woah, I show the pussy-bitch bankroll, now she can do us
No, and we the best, every time we come around, boy, they root for us
True, and everybody hate Chris, but I got them racks up, now they Luda
Yeah, tell baby girl I only want the throat, flute us
Ayy, I don't wanna tease it, I really wan' freak it
I'm Michael, I beat it, I'm keepin' your secret
I got more hoes than Pleasers, the one that's on Bleveland
She pull up and freak it, she pull up and freak it
I hop out the 'Rari, I'm leaving it started
Ayy, she got just a Harley and a star just like Hardee's
Ayy, you play with her garden, she smoke you like Marley
Ayy, now she be my darlin', yeah, she be my Barbie

Five thousand on Yeezys, they think I ain't Jesus
Get my ice out the freezer, it cost a lil' Beamer
She fuckin' my whoadie, yeah, lil' bitty shorty
She think he adoring 'cause his pockets on Norbit
Play with me and these bitch niggas gon' die
All I want is that head and that ain't no lie
Nigga ask if you dizzy, don't say nothin'
These niggas 'bout faker than a puppet

Ayy, I don't wanna tease it, I really wan' freak it
I'm Michael, I beat it, I'm keepin' your secret
I got more hoes than Pleasers, the one that's on Bleveland
She pull up and freak it, she pull up and freak it
I hop out the 'Rari, I'm leaving it started
