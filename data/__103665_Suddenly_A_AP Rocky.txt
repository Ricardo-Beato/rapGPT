Who you need in ya life, nobody
Where I be taking flights, the islands
Pour 3 in my sprite, I’m wildin (d d d)
Can’t get on one knee for no trife, she got mileage
I made all these bands by my lone, except for college

Pour 3 in my sprite, I’m wildin (d d d)
Can’t get on one knee for no trife, she got mileage
I made all these bands by my lone, except for college
I be smoking trees to the dome, I’m in highland
What the fuck just leave me alone, i feel tired
Bitch I rock supreme with the chrome, I feel tired
