15 ContributorsSpyder Lyrics
Tell them pussy niggas "Hold up"
Nothin' but the best, countin' money while I roll up
Screamin' "Ball hard, go bigger"
Yeah, ball hard, go bigger, yeah
Pussy niggas hatin', nigga so what
Meanwhile, I'm in the spot, niggas doin' donuts
Screaming' "Ball hard, go bigger"
Yeah, ball hard, go bigger, yeah

Call me Jeezy Young Gotti, 'cause all I beat is odds
Sayin' that they real when them niggas really fraud
Bitch, I came from the bottom, that's right, under the basement
S'posed to leave it in the pot until it's harder than some pavement
Fuck these niggas talkin', I've been ballin' for a century
Niggas think of quarter kis and scales when they mention me
Three point five, damn right, I had to grind it out
Graveyards and penitentiaries bars, I told them sign me up
Pops didn't wear no rubber, I was made for this shit (raw)
In the kitchen whippin' like a straight slave for this shit
Spill some liquor on my feet, I just paid for this shit
See the time piece, Flava Flav in this bitch, my lord

Tell them pussy niggas "Hold up"
Nothin' but the best, countin' money while I roll up
Screamin', "Ball hard, go bigger"
Yeah, ball hard, go bigger, yeah
Pussy niggas hatin', nigga so what
Meanwhile, I'm in the spot niggas, doin' donuts
Screaming', "Ball hard, go bigger"
Yeah, ball hard, go bigger, yeah

Math, my boy, I'm 'bout arithmetic
Now go get your bitch and get the fuck off my dick
You can be a lot of things but you'll never be this
Word to Stevie Wonder, bitch, you'll never see this
I went hard on them suckers, I served all of them cluckers
Niggas switched up sides, I don't fuck with none of them busters
Tried to fuck up my groove but I was already groovin'
Them bitches can't stop a train that's when it's already movin'
Look, I got a confession, I just bought a new .40
Hangin' out with the big ones, so we gone call this bitch shorty
One thing about shorty, we be up in that club
And if she feel that you hatin', well she gone show you some love
What I gotta lose? I ain't never had shit
Two hundred fifty one grams in this plastic
Now it's Avion and champagne, nigga on my rider
Ever in my city, you might see me in that Spyder

Tell them pussy niggas, "Hold up"
Nothin' but the best, countin' money while I roll up
Screamin', "Ball hard, go bigger"
Yeah, ball hard, go bigger, yeah
Pussy niggas hatin', nigga so what
Meanwhil,e I'm in the spot niggas, doin' donuts
Screamin', "Ball hard, go bigger"
Yeah, ball hard, go bigger, yeah3Embed
