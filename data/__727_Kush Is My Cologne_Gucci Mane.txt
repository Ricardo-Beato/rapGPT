31 ContributorsKush Is My Cologne Lyrics
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong
I know kush is my cologne, Ku-Kush is my cologne
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong

Got a swisher filled up with that one hitter quitter, bro
Bubba for your troubles on the double itl'l get you bro
Pass me the D's, light it up with ease
In a cirle full of G’s, smoking on them trees
Pass me a cigar, and i'm-a bust it down quick
Pass me the purple, make sure that ho is round and thick
Break it down, fill it up, roll it up and light it
And you know it’s the bomb, soon as it get ignited
Pimping I can’t even fight it, it's calling me to smoke
So I fire up another square and take another toke
I be damn near goin broke
And my girl say I’m wrong, shit but

Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong
I know kush is my cologne, Ku-Kush is my cologne
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong

I'm inhaling it, exhaling it, it makes me more intelligent
I feel like I’m still mailing it or selling it, they smelling it
Kush, purp, strong dro. What I need cologne for?
They tried to send me to rehab but I said
"No, no I won't go"
Damn it's really loud, smelling like a whole pound
Kush cologne, haze is her perfume
Bubba kush for breakfast, with my Captain Crunch
I smoke ten blunts before lunch
Know that sounds like that’s too much
I'm so high, I'm so in the sky, everybody know
Marijuana is my fragrance, probably smell it on my clothes
I smoke that bubonic sonic, I've been sipping gin and tonic
You lil' boys is hooked on phonics, Gucci hooked on chronic, Sonny
You might also like
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong
I know kush is my cologne, Ku-Kush is my cologne
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong

I'm in this booch hella keyed (hella keyed, man, I'm sacked)
Man I've been smoking hella weed (Hella tweed man, and I ain't talking about Twitter, man, I'm talking about tweed)
Lick it twist back down
Probably won't know how I go home
Baby wanna suck my bone
She gotta fuck me jeans on
Fuck me dress on, fuck me jeans on
Fuck me dress on, fuck me jeans on
Anything holling a dane
Tryin' get brain butIdon't know her name
Looking at my chain
Let me explain
Kush, cocaine but I don't make it rain
Gimme the gudda bitch, no extension
Pay me up or pay me no attention
Send a botch, like you send it
Make her upload, all up in it
Retirement plan, Booch you my pension
Hater repellant, my brand new invention
Everything that I say I meant it
Rasied in the Bay where its’ so pimpin’
Raised in the Bay where it’s so pimpin’
Raised in the Bay where the bitches tempting
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong
I know kush is my cologne, Ku-Kush is my cologne
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong

Kush is my cologne, I got many fragrances
Shit gets so expensive but I hardly have to pay for shit
Every puff is like a squirt, smell it all off in my shirt
Coworkers give me compliments every time I go to work
What kinda cologne you on?
Dro is like my aftershave
Have me feelin and smellin so good yo I don’t have to bathe
But by all means, I must keep my balls clean
Make sure my dicks legit then I go take care the small things
And it all seems worth it
450's kinda steep but I deserve it
Weed smell so loud that you think you heard that purp

Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong
I know kush is my cologne, Ku-Kush is my cologne
Kush is my cologne, gone on that stupid strong2Embed
