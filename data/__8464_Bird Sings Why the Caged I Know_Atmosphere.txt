Regarde le serpent mignon. Mords-tu, le serpent ? Salut

It's the bird, it must have been the bird
Disgusting critter, it must
We should have known better than to trust
This disease-infested ball of lust and carnage
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Get the bird, catch her, shoot her, I don't care
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
Got to tear her apart, let me at her first
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inhabit the earth
What's she thinking
Does she really believe
That she's above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
Like she's chosen over those who walk around on two feet
The bird, the melodies she play
The music she make
Rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
Trying to remind us, it's time to awake
Antagonizing and instigating my hate
The chirps, I'll turn them into screams
My feathered friend's end will justify the means
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
And swing her in circles until she's too dizzy to speak
Well I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly)
She's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free
I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(She's a snake that can fly)
She's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better than me just because she's free
