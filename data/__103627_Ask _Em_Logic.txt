22 ContributorsAsk â€™Em Lyrics
Yo it's your boy Phil Ade
Ah man it's crazy here
Logic, I think they're ready for it
Let's get it!

Yeah I got it now what is it, pay the world a visit
Let them know I'm 'bout it with this golden ticket
See my curriculum is flippin' 'em
A hundred and fifty one yeah we sippin' 'em,
Bitches they trippin' all up in the club
Show me love if you really 'bout it, I don't never doubt it
One of the best out of Maryland
I'm down to shout it (Oh really?)
Never cocky I'm just confident the flow is prominent
This is the reason that I'm dominant
That automatic platinum plated flow, know I'ma shine with it
All of y'all is down to conform but I realign with it
Performing at a full house, feeling like Uncle Jesse
Bitches they stress me, take them to the crib undress three
Children lie, men lie, women lie then we die
But I'm here to tell the truth and let you know I'm finna rise
To no surprise, fake rappers meet your demise
The microphone and Adobe Audition my only supplies
Look within my eyes, yes I'll bury the odds
Now I ask 'em, is you feelin' me?
You might also like
I got it back and now I'm on again
Hit you in your chest like breathing after a shot of Gin
I'm just a living organism that has arisen
With so many bars, I can manufacture for various prisons
So let me show you what I'm 'bout and baby how I do it
Flowin' for hours every day just so I can improve it
When I perform I envision a crowd and how to move it
See I am lyrically inclined
Alphabetically take apart and rebuild your mind
I'm on my grind and guarantee ain't no style like mine
I bring the force of course with no remorse
I'm married to the game, don't even talk about divorce
'Till death do us part, reincarnate then restart
With Biggie's eyes, Big L's mind, and Pac's heart
Rip it apart, intravenously like poison dart,
Y'all bananas if you think I'm slippin' in Mario's Kart2Embed
