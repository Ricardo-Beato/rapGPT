13 ContributorsNo Love Lyrics
It's Gucci
Burrr

30 inches on the truck, nigga, no rub
And I don't give these cocksuckers no love
I'm double cupped up, nigga, straight mud
So, your first impression is a nigga sell drugs
I got ball player money, I be pieced up
And if you gettin' money, nigga, we can link up
I might pull up to the club in a Brinks truck
I'm smoking out the pound bag, nigga, straight bud

Loose leaves, fuck the shoestrings, let the bitches hang
I'm just a East Atlanta nigga, spittin this East Atlanta game
Make a girl sprain her ankle when she see my chain blang
I wear so many diamond necklaces, her neck turn like the exorcist
Just came back from Texas, I just re-upped with the Mexicans
Ran off on the plug, all while I delete all his messages
Gucci Man, the glacier I started all this flexin' shit
Baels of Kush and baels of purp, miled to two different addresses
This white shit that I'm sellin' will make you go turn on your relatives
Fuck your plug, come shop with me, you know I got them better deals
Kush so strong, gotta smoke it in the restroom
Niggas say they got that gas, well Gucci got that jet fuel
You might also like
30 inches on the truck, nigga, no rub
And I don't give these cocksuckers no love
I'm double cupped up, nigga, straight mud
So, your first impression is a nigga sell drugs
I got ball player money, I be pieced up
And if you gettin' money, nigga, we can link up
I might pull up to the club in a Brinks truck
I'm smoking out the pound bag, nigga, straight bud

I put fours on the coupe, they said they wouldn't fit
And I drop 30's on the truck, they say the same shit
Told 'em 30 for a brick, they say I'm insane
But it's a drought and they Gucci say the same thing
All I rock is 'Sace, 600 for a T-Shirt
I got 30 on my hip, extended clip, that how the heat work
Cold-ass niggas, they should call a nigga A-C
Got these niggas hot cause I dropped Freon in my A-P
Froze!
And when it come to hoes, yeah, I got 'em
And he was playin' games with that chain, so I shot 'em
Gotti! Realest nigga in it, don't you doubt 'em
400 for that 'Rari, bitch, I'mma jump up out 'em

30 inches on the truck, nigga, no rub
And I don't give these cocksuckers no love
I'm double cupped up, nigga, straight mud
So, your first impression is a nigga sell drugs
I got ball player money, I be pieced up
And if you gettin' money, nigga, we can link up
I might pull up to the club in a Brinks truck
I'm smoking out the pound bag, nigga, straight bud3Embed
