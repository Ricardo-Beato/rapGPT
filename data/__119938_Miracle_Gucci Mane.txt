15 ContributorsMiracle Lyrics
It’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
I make a half to a whole one
Yeah that’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Broke nigga turn a millionaire
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Got 26’s on my vehicles
And it’s a motherfuckin' miracle

Nah I ain't motherfuckin' lyrical
Got 50 bowls in my living room
My bedroom is the chicken room
I’m eatin' like it’s Thanksgiving fool
And I do it like a nigga do
I rap up but I pull the trigger too
Your best bet, get a bigger crew
I’m playin' chess while you shootin' pool
Make your next move, be your best move
Run up on Guwap, I’ma let loose
What you mad for, nigga I’m upset too
Pissy yellow jewelry jeweler in the restroom
I'm the type of nigga hit you with a bar stool
You the type of bitch that make-up, wear a costume
You little boys better go and watch some cartoons
Cuz I’m my own man, nigga I’m my own goon
And I swear I got a whip game incredible
God take my breath now if I’m scared of you
I turn your best friend to a fuckin' vegetable
But I’ma stop talkin', I ain’t tryna lecture you
I’m the president, nigga it’s election year
EA dictator, ain’t no re-elections here
Spectator nigga, ten steps ahead of you
Before I dap you up, I'd rather wet you up
You might also like
It’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
I make a half to a whole one
Yeah that’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Broke nigga turn a millionaire
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Got 26’s on my vehicles
And it’s a motherfuckin' miracle

AK's, ain’t no pistols here
And we gon' wet you up here
Now is a motherfuckin miracle
How I put a hundred bands in one ear
I got 2 on, 2 hundred bands in my ear
Who this nigga here, standing mighty close to my rear, I’m just keepin' it real
I’ll go shoot his ass and his rear, damage my career
Hundred bands make me stand here
Diamonds come from Sicilys
Bitch I’m just playin', I appear, diamonds crystal clear
Oh you you got them bands, ok dear, we gon' milk you here
My big bro got tattooed tears, and those M&M's
I'm a throw back boy and a blood, I need feminins
Guwap set up shop anywhere, anytime ho
Thugga come with blocks anywhere, any kind ho
Green bells, white bells, oh that smell, yeah that smell
Very rare, we everywhere
You never dare, you in a wheelchair
I’ll take that bitch, slut that bitch
Fuck that bitch, suck that bitch
Send that bitch back to you dead broke, she like money in men
Suck you like a tick for your paper
Just to bring it back to me
She like when I shine like a glacier
My pinky rings are equator
My cups ain't no maper, I meant maple
Apple juice, purple, baby bottles, gerbler
I mean Gerber, kill shit, murder, sipper
Slupper, it’s a motherfuckin' miracle, I’m lyrical
It’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
I make a half to a whole one
Yeah that’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Broke nigga turn a millionaire
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Got 26's on my vehicles
And it’s a motherfuckin' miracleEmbed
