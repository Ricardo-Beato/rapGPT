14 ContributorsGang Signs Lyrics
(The Mekanix)

S-N-double-O, don't forget the P, pimp
A hundred million later and I’m still on that G shit
Been all around the world on my LBC shit
213 click, wish Nate could see this
Recognize game when it's in your face
And when I pull up, all you hear is "Everlasting Bass"
Say what up to my young life, give dap to the G's
Kiss some aunties and models that’s happy to see me
Snoopy D-O-double, where you been?
On Highway 110 doing a hundred and ten
Back in the building like I forgot something
Mekanix on the beat, you know it knock, cousin
Flow dippin' and slidin', Crippin' and ridin', sittin' on candy paint
Dressin' and finessin', lookin’ like a blessing
Making all the hoes faint, the Dogg

Four-fifteens with thе Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is thе slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)
Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Niggas throwing up gang signs
You might also like
Four-nick shells, somethin’ fat on my lap
Couple suckas that'll tell you how I cracked on they hat
Couple suckas that’ll tell you we ain't dishin' out passes
Couple suckas that ain't here and we’ll piss on they ashes, yeah
Twisting up my fingers, send a signal like the blinkers
Get you hit with all these blickies, Nipsey screamin' out the speakers
Hit me on my beeper if it's urgent or you tweakin'
Free my lil' bruh from Kiefer, if he snitchin', you can keep him (Yeah)
Show the pink slip if you ain't leased 'em, nigga, shut up
I just stuck my dick all in her mouth, she actin' stuck-up
Why they do the most on Instagram, but never run up?
Probably 'cause I'm ridin' with that yeeky, I got one up (Yeah)
Membership, ask about the Mozzy, niggas been the shit
Benefits, profit off they work 'cause that's what business is
The tentative, all I heard was dividends, I'm all in
On Bloods, we put in labor with kaydas, it wasn't no calling in

Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)
Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Niggas throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)
Still sippin' gin and juice while I'm smoking marijuana
I bet you never blew with Obama
Crip walking with my homegirl Martha
While I'm passing joints to Madonna
Who wanna smoke with Snoop? Let's have a smoke or two
Puff, puff, pass, that's what real smokers do
You was smokin' on Gary Payton, I was smokin' with Gary Payton
We not the same, stop hatin'
Triple gold Daytons and the walls is white
Never made it to the league, but live a baller's life (Yeah)
Rest in peace Kobe and Gigi
LA ain't been the same since we lost the homie Nipsey (Neighborhood)
Pour out a little liquor for Pac
And while you at it, say a prayer for the homie Doc
When Snoop drop, I make the world go crazy
It still ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby

I got four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)
Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Niggas throwing up gang signs (Suwoop, The Mekanix)
Another one of those Bay Area slappers
Bread in hand, cheese and crackers
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Big Boss Dogg, The Mekanix
Huh, what's happenin', Fab?
It's a dope era we livin' in, man
Ayy, if you don't understand that, you don't understand nothin'
You under-dig what I mean?
We just chopping game right now, man, with the Zap, man
Got the Zap board in my hand
Tuning this shit to— ayy, turn that bass up a little bit like
Yeah, uh-huh
Turn them highs down right, yeah, right there
Yeah
Now bring that hook back
Bring that shit back, Loco
Come on

I got four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap (Yes sir)
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
My niggas throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)
Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
My niggas throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)1Embed
