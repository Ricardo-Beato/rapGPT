Strapped up but I'm iced down (Iced down)
All white crib with the black tower (Black tower)
She don't want to love me (Love me)

Four bad bitches on a white couch (White couch)
Last night, tried to pipe down (Pipe)
Told her hol' up, let me put the pipe down (Pipe down)
Touchdown, I ain't even ate yet (Ate yet)
Serve it on a platter in a red dress (Red dress)
Chinchilla, turn that bitch to Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
All she want to do is fuckin' hit the beach (Hit the beach)
Sand from her toes out the Lambo (Out the Lambo)
Hit Turk Caicos for your sandals (Sandals)
30 round clip for the wrong day (Wrong day)
Drivin' in the whip, up the wrong way

Mansion in the Hills and my neighbors is so nosy
Only Maybach in Bompton so I'm sliding with the 40 (Oh!)

My diamonds on disco and they dancin' hokey pokey
