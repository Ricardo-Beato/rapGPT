96 ContributorsRetro (Rough) Lyrics
Uh, uh
Here we go, boom, boom
Yeah, uh, uh
Oh, no-no-no
Yeah, okay

We can go together, it doesn't really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try

Young Bino in the house like a B&E
Why I'm looking so fly, I'm just being me
Moved up, weed in my girl clutch
White girls, so the twelve never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god she need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in?
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down, then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique, there's a lot of us
They talk shit, but nobody else on top of us
Got popular, this the real shit
Get—in the face with a full clip
Get—in the aim, niggas don't slip
Then get—with a case just for sellin' it
I know them gorillas, I hang with them killers
They paint 'em as villains when really they livin', we gotta ball
This is World War Three, I'm the new Jay-Z
I ain't write shit down, I'ma steal that crown
I'ma do that thing, girl, you sweeter than mango
How we cool and confident with hair like Django?
How we walk in the room and the girls they notice?
'Cause they know you bogus, I'm the man you noticed, and
You might also like
We can go together, it doesn't really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try

I'ma show you how to do this
It's easy when you let go, let go
Didn't mean to make you nervous
The booty lookin' retro, retro
You can be the moon to me
And I can be your spotlight (Spotlight)
And if you think I'm ballin'
You shoulda seen me last night, last night
Fuck that, fuck ya'll and the po-po's
Down under, surfin' on the Gold Coast
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt
And I ain't got a home, let's stunt
So, baby, if you feel like you wanna leave
I ain't afraid to drop a couple SkyMiles
The game ain't easy
We both deserve a little bit of timeout

We can go together, it doesn't really matter
(Cough)
Oh
Yeah
'Kay, one, two, three, go!
Oh, hey
Oh, hey, ah
