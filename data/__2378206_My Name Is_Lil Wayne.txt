My name is, my name is
My name is Weezy Baby, and I'm high—
Like maintenance, I'm smokin'
I'm drinkin', leanin' daily, like—
Hi! My name is—you know what my name is
Bitch, I'm famous, like Tom Brady
And hi—your name is? Not important
Who cares? Not Weezy Baby, ugh

Wake up, I see "bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch"
Ugh, makeup on my pillows make me mad, bitch
Without no makeup, I see that bitch as just average
Ugh, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi
Looking at my Rollie, I got boogers on my Rollie
'Bout to hook up with my whoadie
Got the hook-up on that codeine
Got the sugar for your nose ring
Got the blooka, I'm reloading
And according to my darling, this dick feels so damn rewarding
I'm reporting out of shorty, she so naughty, me so horny
Kilo on me like I'm Tony, break it down to Rice-A-Roni
Take her out, look like she lonely
I'm gon' candlelight the moment
I'ma vandalize the pussy
She told him "My phone was roaming," ugh
She be moaning 'til the morning, I be goin' in
I be on it, I be in it, I'm like Foreman on the grill
And I got doormen at the entrance
They got pistols in they trenches
They got rituals, religion
And I'm like, "Bitch, you know I'm sipping 'til I die"
You might also like
My name is Lil Wayne, bitch
Weezy F. Baby, ha
Her name went from whatever-it-was
To "Lil Wayne' bitch"—now, that's crazy
And I, I camed in, regained strength
Re-banged it, rotation
Her guy? He's nameless, he ain't shit
Always on the same shit—poor baby

I pour up so much, they call me "Pour Baby"
Kush man, I need a sack like Charles Haley
Sipping to the Big Moe, I'm the Barre Baby
Sip got me moving slow, but my thoughts racing, err!
My long days give me short patience
My heart vacant, awards taken
What in tarnation? No information, no statements
Young Mula, old moolah, moolah all ages
Ha-Hallelujah, I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac
Roc-A-Fella, new rock, hundred K in a shoebox
AK and a new Glock go, "Wop-bap-ba-loo-bop"
Pray the vest you got save you like a coupon
Hustle 'til my dreadlock is grey as some Poupon
Every day is my birthday: I'm a newborn
Stay on my toes, ask a shoehorn
I ain't got no roof on, gettin' my No Ceilings 2 on
And hi, I'm brainless, I'm stainless
Entertainment: His lady
And, um, if she ain't thick, then she ain't it
I can't fuck with a slim lady
I tried, but Superhead keep complaining
Bitch ancient, bitch shady, and she tired
Okay, then—I'm skatin'
Doing tricks—call me "'Trick Swayze"

Okay, In other news and other niggas' hoes
Your wife taste like Honey Nut Cheerios
I'm in the mirror, like "Ooh, baby"
Who needs a miracle when I got you, baby?
Pimpin' in my last life; I'm the shit, you ass-wipe
Beat the pussy, cat fight, my teeth look like a flashlight
Weed is like a airline, 'cause easily, I'm that high
Fistful of money: Mix some green in with your black eye
Greedy like a fat guy, I'll eat a nigga franchise
I beat him by a landslide, a leader like a rabbi
I'm leading by halftime; he bleeding, I'm a vampire
His body in the trunk with his feet all on my Alpines
We the niggas—that's right, we all that and fries
Y'all on standby, my broads got cat eyes
Traphouse landlines, boom like landmines
All my bitches allies with "Tune" on they backside
So hi, my name is on her anus
On her cranium, bitch cravin'
And I'm fly, and I'm wavy, and her name is Bust-It-Baby
And hi, my name is in your mouth, it must be tasty—gone!32Embed
