"Thinkin' about what he gon' do now"
"Ri-ride through the hood"
"Keep it low to the ground" "Gangster"
"Ride through the hood"
"Keep it low to the ground"
"Ri-ride through the hood"
"Keep it low to the ground" "Gangster"
"Ride through the hood, ride through the hood"
"Ri-ride through the hood"
"Keep it low to the ground"
"Ri-ride through the hood"
"Keep it low to the ground"
"Ri-ri-ri-ride through the hood"
"Keep it low to the ground" "Gangster"
"Low, low to the, l-l-low to the ground"

You see my lo' lo' (doin' what it 'pose to do)
And that fo' do' (doin' what it 'pose to do)
You know my big watch (doin' what it 'pose to do)
I make the bitches watch (doin' what it 'pose to do)
I see that big ass (doin' what it 'pose to do)
When you walk pass (doin' what it 'pose to do)
You know my shit shine (doin' what it 'pose to do)
I make the bitch mine (doin' what it 'pose to do)
You might also like
Had to come through, shine on you niggas
Stop lyin' on a nigga, got my nine on your liver {​​*click clack*}​​
Fuck around and go blind on a nigga
Do time for a nigga, put your mind on your mirror (POO POW!)
All you niggas that's materialistic
Don't fuck wit'cha boy or become a statistic
Ice Cube is very artistic
But I'm still from the hood, will take your existence
So muhfuckers tryna scratch my paint
It's West coast in the house, what the fuck you thank? (what the fuck you thank?)
Big bank got, spent on my outfit
Cause I'm fly and your ass ain't about shit
I let that bullshit do what it 'pose to do
Go to the club, grab me a ho or two
Understand, God has a chosen few
Fuck around, and I'll put some holes in you

You see my lo' lo' (doin' what it 'pose to do)
And that fo' do' (doin' what it 'pose to do)
You know my big watch (doin' what it 'pose to do)
I make the bitches watch (doin' what it 'pose to do)
I see that big ass (doin' what it 'pose to do)
When you walk pass (doin' what it 'pose to do)
You know my shit shine (doin' what it 'pose to do) {​​bling}​​
I make the bitch mine (doin' what it 'pose to do)
Now e'ry muhfucker in here can picture me rollin'
In that big body wide thang, a nigga controllin'
Y'all jealous of the ass that a nigga be holdin'
Ain't scared of the po' po' and what they patrollin'?
Gotta job muhfucker, I work for myself
I got benefits bitch, dental and health
I do it 24/7, I rob 7-11
If I had to, I take it straight back to heaven
'Witta Attitude', I got the Range blowed out
So if you jack me homey, I never jump out (No!)
I just tickle these switches and pickle these bitches
That's lickin' all on my paint job like liquorish
I know a lotta dances, they call me Jolly Ranchers
Cause I shine like Rudolph, nigga fuck Prancer!
Ice Cube, reflect like chrome (bling!)
When I'm in the hood, I run it like Rome (Yi-YAY!)


Call her ass right there, she got that kush
And I'mma run all through it like Reggie Bush
And I'mma hit that bush like George Bush
In the middle of the night like a crook
Don't fuck with her, her ass is average
Only fuck with the ones with the whole package
Who gives a fuck if yo' ass look good
If yo' ass can't cook good, that's on the hood (that's on the hood)
Fine bitches, you shit out of luck
Cause I'm prolly gon' eat more than I fuck (more than I fuck)
You got do it all, not just in the mall
Cook and cleaning, love a nigga's shitty drawers
Naw, I'll keep you flossin' up at Ready Tellers
The kinda shit that make them other bitches jealous
Pull up, jump out, I'm like new money
And watch the bees in the house come and get the honey
