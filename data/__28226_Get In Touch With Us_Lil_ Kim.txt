10 ContributorsGet In Touch With Us Lyrics
"Now you've seen this before, don't
Don't tell me what's been happening, okay, just let me sit here, enjoy"
Yea-yea yea yea, (I'm back) (Yea)
Aw yeah, (I'm back) (I'm)
(I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats)
Aw yeah (I'm back)
(I'm back)
Yea yea (I'm back)
(I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats)

If you see a 745 and a body that's wide
Take a peek and make sure ain't nobody inside
Fuckin with the Bee you might not make it alive
Cause it's MURDAHHH; ain't talkin Irv and Ja
Y'all sleep on baby girl, I seldom frown
Spit the shank out my mouth, and bust you down
Biggie left me the torch, so I'm holdin it now
And you sick cause I'm a bitch and I'm holdin it down
If Styles say get you, without no doubt
I'm a set you real good then I'm airin you out
Rep your coast, we got the crack, one hit you overdosed
That shadow that you see, that's my motherfucker Ghost (What up nigga?)
S.P., Lil' Kim, we in it to win it
Do a bid for my crimey, that's my co-defendant
And you snitch niggas tryin to get a nigga locked up
Come through in the ice and truck and tear your whole block up
You might also like
(Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap) Yea-yea yea yea
(And I'm about to murder cats) Aw yea
(And I'm about to murder cats) Yea-yea yea yea
She Bonnie, I'm Clyde
I kill your mom and watch you stand there traumatized
(Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap) Yea-yea yea yea
(And I'm about to murder cats) Aw yea
(And I'm about to murder cats) Yea-yea yea yea
It's the Ghost and the Queen, motherfucker get in touch with us

You know the Ghost'll steal your soul from you (Ghost)
Lil' Kim'll pull a four and leave a motherfuckin (Lil' Kim) hole in you
I need an antidote
To take away the pain, I gotta smoke weed or crack a nigga cantaloupe
I used to dream of this (I used to)
But now I got the money and the house and the shit seem meaningless (What's it all worth?)
If the grind don't ever stop (huh)
Then my mind won't ever stop, nine won't ever stop (Uh-uh)
They say you too violent (Fuck you), I say you too silent
You scared to represent, I'ma make the news column
This is Holiday and Lil' Kim (Yes it is)
Bust your gun, sell your crack, puff your weed, drink a lil' gin (Go ahead)
Watch the drama ride (Watch it)
She Bonnie, I'm Clyde, I kill your mom (Bonnie and Clyde) and watch you stand there traumatized
You can't fuck with us (Sho' can't)
You think you could?, It's the Ghost and the Queen, motherfucker get in touch with us
(Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap) Yea-yea yea yea
(And I'm about to murder cats) Aw yea
(And I'm about to murder cats) Yea-yea yea yea
She Bonnie, I'm Clyde
I kill your mom and watch you stand there traumatized
(Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap) Yea-yea yea yea
(And I'm about to murder cats) Aw yea
(And I'm about to murder cats) Yea-yea yea yea

And I'm leavin with most of your cream
Nigga knock off the riffin shit, understand that
I'ma kill a made nigga
And I'ma kill the witnesses
Y.O. nigga

Nigga bust off your hammer
And cook them bricks
If you really had dough like you said you did
We woulda run up in your crib and been took that shit
If I want a nigga dead then I'm doin the shit
And your girl right behind you with the oo and the fifth
It's the Queen and the Ghost, who shit this tight?
Yeah, Frank is the King, so call me Ms. White
And I ask niggas who wan' dance
And I got his back like that bitch from "True Romance"
S.P. the Mack Milli'
