55 ContributorsDonâ€™t Know Lyrics
London on da track, bitch!

My newest bitch say that she got it, ya digg?
Show me your mill, I put my sig in, ya digg?
I want that pussy, 'cause it's as tight as a kick
Look at my Rollie, it's as cool as a fridge
Push your top back 'cause I feel like it a wig
I don't know why, I don't why, but I did
I don't know why, I don't why, yeah
But can you hurry up and buy, yeah

Graduated from Howard I'm the shit no bowel
Beat it up for an hour, she's wet as a shower
Hoppin' out on them cowards with nothing but 'em whoppers
I'm a level 5 goblin
30 deep, all them lil' niggas be mobbin'
Have you ever seen a street geek barbarian
R.I.P. Monroe no Marilyn
Give my mama everythin' nigga, evident
Ayy, I ain't goin' steady, but I'm ready
Let 'em bitches hit just like your necklace
We got blocks and we treacherous
Take your necklace, you neckless
Please stay outta my section, yeah
Pullin' out that choppa that moment that nigga get her, yeah
You might also like
My newest bitch say that she got it, ya dig?
Show me your mail, I put my stick in, ya dig?
I want that pussy, 'cause it's as tight as a kick
Look at my Rollie, it's as cold as a fridge
Push your top back 'cause I feel like you the wig
I don't know why, I don't why, but I did
I don't know why, I don't why, yeah
But can you hurry up and buy, yeah

God, got this gas, blowin' so hard
Call a nigga shrimp, that's a po'boy
They gon' make us let the windows down on a Rolls-Royce
Hustle hard, I keep that .44, got a dick
Bitches get round me they sneezin', jewelry game sick
I love mud, I done poured the deuce up so slick
Hop up in my car, now lick and go sit on the stick
Put the marker on 'em niggas and see if they real
I'm out in Texas, buyin' pint, keep this shit trill
I got ashes droppin' on the Bentley steerin' wheel
Xan got me feel like I'm on a Ferris wheel
They came 'round the neighborhood with that fire paint
He got 'em on drop-top just like a stingray
My nigga came with 'em bails, that shit was green day
I play the star role juggin' like in a screenplay
God
My newest bitch say that she got it, ya digg?
Show me your mill, I put my sig in, ya digg?
I want that pussy, 'cause it's as tight as a kick
Look at my Rollie, it's as cold as a fridge
Push your top back 'cause I feel like it a wig
I don't know why, I don't why, but I did
I don't know why, I don't why, yeah
But can you hurry up and buy, yeah11Embed
