53 ContributorsHellz Wind Staff Lyrics
The Wu-Tang Clan will rise again
There are many of us, all working for the good of the Wu-Tang
Die

So get your egg crashed by my Hellz Wind Staff
While the pictures broadcast and splash to tell the news
Like Katie Chung, how the bullet collapsed his lung
His father watched in horror as he swallowed his tongue
Another youth dead before the age of 21
Left his son to grow in the ghettos of the slums
Where the shots echo for twisted metal for cash flow
React slow, nigga, and get P.L.O
By the lone gunner who took revenge for his brother
Who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
A new year is dawnin', new crews is formin'
Rival gangs warrin', blood steadily pourin'
The streets are deep, son, every day is like a rerun
So I reach out and try to teach one
But 85% uncivilized content
No tolerance, so a lifetime is spent
Behind a cage, bent, smoked out and on a park bench
Killer instinct, slave rap niggas get lynched

So, yo! Break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
Tell Ra, Goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
To all you slew-footed penguins
Duckin' from these hot rocks that's flamin'
Chocolate for all you rap Damians
Sprayin' cards, espionage, dodge ball square hard
Strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
In the makin', next album — Blood on Chef Apron
Keep a Gambino PlayStation in your playpen
Discovery Channel, cats the Book of Daniel
Coke blunts hot as a fuck, swatted bamboo
High school dropouts, baseheads get knocked the fuck out!
On the regular for robbin' a good nigga house
Rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
Hot rock lava, gringo throw the Frusen Gladjé
You might also like
Yo, what you know about this specialist armed dangerous?
Hit you close range with this madness
Unique design shine like a deep dish
The beat kick, technique spit on your weak shit
Yes! The rhythm, the Rebel, alone in my level
Heat it up past the boiling point of metal
Livin' legend, veteran known to set trend
Lethal weapon, step through your section
With the force like Luke Skywalker
Rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
Live performer, bid the mic sayōnara
Borderline to insane, I rain firewater
Tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
I got my sword 'cross your throat, you choke

We on the run with the golden guns, get you none
When it reach out and touch someone, blaze they buns
Now I'm guilty by association
Times of blackness eclipsin' the Sun
Target practice commence
When I throw these darts at these rappers
Ricochet, hit the charts, bloody your mattress
Hold me down, Wu bloodkin, I'm goin' in
Shootin' bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
Blend like chameleon
All these niggas want cheese, is we mice or men? Word up!
We can go platinum, but then still can't get no satisfaction
Once again, back on the block crumb snatchin', blowin' backs in
Cold-blooded 9 assassins, time for action
Johnny Unitas, handle that like arthritis
Still, hold a golden touch like King Midas
Drownin' problems in Heinekens imported from Holland
Gettin' boosted off of Killa Bee pollen
Stone columns get trapped by drum tracks
Smack loud as gun claps
Pin a crab to death with a thousand thumbtacks
The Wu centerfold, it be's the Wind Ninja scroll
Soul edged blade controls your Interpol
The Fig Newt', fruit from the forbidden tree root
I stay secluded in the Chamber, trainin' new recruits
With Fatal Guillotine, the black hooded team
What it means when bullet screams
From the hot Glock like rock from a sling (Sometimes...)
Pushed through like George Bush Operation: Whoops
Shots get popped on the block, causin' blood to gush
From digital to analogue, the Wu-Wear camouflage
My entourage squad be stompin' through Zanzibar
Like herds of cattle, RZA plays the wall like a shadow
Connectin' Brooklyn/Shaol like the Verrazanno-Narrows

Stash your C.R.E.A.M., though
Iceatollah ice style gleamo
Lex graffiti name Remo
Holdin', we rollin', askin' me, though
Raps is hotter than hot tamales in Toledo
Pussy — that shit she passin' off to me, though
We wax Ajax niggas with a axe, Maxamill
You could crash a mill’, got your back still
Scold 'em and fold 'em like they thousand dollar bills
Sit back, eyein' y'all niggas out
Fakes that delegate, we spittin' fire out
Verb burglar, design a Wally shoe store reserve a jet status
Guyanese bird up on my mattress
Watch me mack this! Ralph Lauren goose incite a fashion
Yo, these hands is flooded and they mad quick
Strong approach like magnets, custom wood crane name
Stylin' rich, résumé the waves and one chain
Feelin' mics like wheelin' a bike
Slide like step on his Klondike, get your dart right
We moving on it like wind breaker niggas get they face broke
Jewelery get snatched
Magazine right on the low, fuck y'all cats! (Sometimes...)6Embed
