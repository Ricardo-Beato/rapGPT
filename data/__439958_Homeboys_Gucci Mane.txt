16 ContributorsHomeboys Lyrics
Yeah, 1017, MPA, Longway, I love you
Straight up, Guwop
Yeah

(This one for my homeboys)
Man, motherfuck my enemies
Them niggas not no kin to me nor friend of me
(This one for my homeboys)
Who stayed down through thick and thin
Never changing up nor switchin'
(This one for my homeboys)
Who locked up and couldn't make it
And they sittin' at the county jail just waiting
(This one for my homeboys)
And we been together since knee high
Skippin' school and gettin' high, that's no lie

If I was high as fuck, then he was high as fuck
If I was fly as fuck, then he was fly as fuck
Then you stole something and that was fucked up
And that's bad luck, but good luck with that
And now you can't get shit from me, but an old snapback
And you always knew my only rule, but you still play with this dude
And I learned from the old-heads, gotta set your rules or be ruled
And I'm too tough to be rude, just can't
Momma said I always had a nasty attitude, it stinks
You might also like
First thing's first, bruh miss you to death
Think about you every day since the day you left
In the club going hard all night long
The next morning got a phone call, you never made it home
Oh shit!
Now what the fuck is that? That's fucked up
Ain't too many of my kind that made it out, so I just lucked up
I told Lil T, don't take that dope to Mississippi, he did that shit anyway
To get all of my niggas back, I give all this shit up any day

(This one for my homeboys)
Man, motherfuck my enemies
Them niggas not no kin to me nor friend of me
(This one for my homeboys)
Who stayed down through thick and thin
Never changing up nor switchin'
(This one for my homeboys)
Who locked up and couldn't make it
And they sittin' at the county jail just waiting
(This one for my homeboys)
And we been together since knee high
Skippin' school and gettin' high, that's no lie

Grew up wearing the same jeans, rocking the same shirts
Then we busted guns at each other, this shit hurts
My momma cryin' herself to sleep off the shit we doing
For our kids, I really think that it's a bad influence
Now every time I go out - people asking where you at?
But I can't tell tell the world I'm shooting at my buddy Nick
Before you went to jail, I wanted to make it right
Now I'm a millionaire, you doing life, this shit ain't right
Started off as homeboys, grew up now we enemies
If he cross the line, I'll kill him if he kin to me
I don't think he hearing me, I don't think ya'll feelin' me
Pulled up in the Phantom, ghost now they say they scared of me
All I had was hustle, grew up in the struggle
Small nigga, big heart, now I got the muscle
Long live Slim D, Mario, we miss you
Mario, we miss you

(This one for my homeboys)
Man, motherfuck my enemies
Them niggas not no kin to me nor friend of me
(This one for my homeboys)
Who stayed down through thick and thin
Never changing up nor switchin'
(This one for my homeboys)
Who locked up and couldn't make it
And they sittin' at the county jail just waiting
(This one for my homeboys)
And we been together since knee high
Skippin' school and gettin' high, that's no lie2Embed
