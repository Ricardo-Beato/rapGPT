Yaa
Migos
Just wait on it
Wait
Just wait on it
Go Go

What’s up Migos, when a tape gon' drop?
Just wait on it!
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!
Wanna know Migos is you ever gon' go solo?
Just wait on it!
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that Ion' know
Just wait on it! (x3)
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that Ion' know
Just wait on it! (x3)
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!

These labels keep having debates
We put 'em on hold, tell 'em wait (Hold on!)
Asking me questions like "How did I feel when I had to sit down for a 8?" (What you think?)
They bitin' the swag but we killing these rappers (Bitin'!)
You runner up, Migo first place (Number 1!)
Put ‘em in a grave, disintegrate (Glaw!)
Blue Benjamins all on my dinner plate (Blue benjamins!)
Is Offset ever gonna get on a chorus? (Is he? Huh?)
Just wait on it! (Wait on it!)
I’m your favorite rapper’ favorite
Every rapper biting, they want a taste of it (They bitin'!)
There is no secret who really created it (No secret)
I’m on D-Block, I feel like I’m Jadakiss (D-Block)
Migos blew up like a terrorist (MIGO!)
We murdering tracks and it’s evident (Tell em'!)

What’s up Migos, when a tape gon' drop?
Just wait on it!
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!
Wanna know Migos is you ever gon' go solo?
Just wait on it!
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that Ion' know
Just wait on it! (x3)
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that Ion' know
Just wait on it! (x3)
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!

They want me to sign to your label
Told them to wait and they looked at me crazy
Three M&M's ain’t shit
No we didn't sign, we ripped up the paper
We know that you stealing the fucking flow
It's okay because I got the antidope
We pulling the string like a jump rope
We got the rap game in submission hold
Came up from a pound of midget now I’m riding around in a 750
Pull up to that bando, just me and extensions
Them pans and them pots like business is business
Feeling like summer, Infinity
BOW! GLAW! No witnesses
My niggas vampires like Blade in the Trinity
None of you rappers can fuck with me, bet on me
What’s up Migos, when a tape gon' drop?
Just wait on it!
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!
Wanna know Migos is you ever gon' go solo?
Just wait on it!
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that Ion' know
Just wait on it! (x3)
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that Ion' know
Just wait on it! (x3)
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!

So you wanna be in this rap game? (You wanna be?)
First you gotta make a name (TakeOff!)
QC the label they hate on it
Young Rich Niggas 2, they gone wait on it!
It’s a new generation, OGs like Temptations
Solid Foundation my Margiela's Mason
My money Caucasian, my dope is Caucasian
My plug is a Haitian so how am I racist?
Like Nike I’m ‘bout to start checking you niggas
You Kermit the Frog, I’m dissecting you niggas (Dissecting you)
You sickle cell nigga, 'bout sick of you niggas (Eugh)
You taking my swag, I invented you niggas (Invented you)
Call me Einstein, I got the potion
So I know how to get rid of you niggas (Antidope)
Zanotti sneakers, Giuseppe sweater
Stop it Zay I can do this acapella
What’s up Migos, when a tape gon' drop?
Just wait on it!
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!
Wanna know Migos is you ever gon' go solo?
Just wait on it!
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that Ion' know
Just wait on it! (x3)
Just wait on it nigga, stop asking me shit that Ion' know
Just wait on it! (x3)
You niggas gon' sign to a major or not?
Just wait on it!12Embed
