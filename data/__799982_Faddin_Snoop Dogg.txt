Girl you got me fadin away
And I can’t go another day
You make it hard to stay awake
Girl you got me fadin away
Girl you got me fadin away
Ain’t no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl you got me fadin away
Fadin away

And my mind is all about you
I don’t know what to do cuz you have got me confused
We’re talkin on the phone
We fuss and fight, you bout that life
I just wanna love you right
Love you right

Girl you got me fadin away
And I can’t go another day
You make it hard to stay awake
Girl you got me fadin away
Girl you got me fadin away
Ain’t no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl you got me fadin away
Fadin away
You might also like
Make time to make love
That’s what we made
Lookin nowadays, lookin like it’s gon fade
Tee Wee when they see he a G so
If he lose baby he gon gain another though
What a brother know? Keep it on the low
That’s what my grandma say
It’s supposed to go
Feel the same, we toastin, post
And if it all works out then we Casper the ghost
Me and Dan Funk, we capture the fun
Commune shit and lose shit, we set it all for
Playin with me, oh you best let it all go
The vish, in the wind you blow

I’m fadin away
And I can’t go another day
You make it hard to stay awake
Girl you got me fadin away
Girl you got me fadin away
Ain’t no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl you got me fadin away
Fadin away
Yea
This is uh
Snoopy Collins
Long time, no hear from
Can you smell me?
That’s Dan Funk
Uh
Girl… you got me fadin away
The love you used to love
Just doesn’t appear anymore
Find and you shall seek
Seek and you shall find
Find time to unwind
Yea baby

Fadin away
And I can’t go another day
You make it hard to stay awake
Girl you got me fadin away
Girl you got me fadin away
Ain’t no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl you got me fadin away
Fadin away
It’s hard to stay wit you girl
It’s so hard to stay wit you girl
And even harder to play wit you girl
It’s so hard to stay wit you girl
And even harder to play wit you girl
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin awayEmbed
