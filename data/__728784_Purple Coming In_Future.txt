That purple be comin' in, yeah (Yeah)
I'm poured up on dirty Sprite again (Yeah)
I pop on these Percs and Vicodins
Then check on that check like a Yeezy (Yeezy)
Came from straight out them trenches, they greasy (They need me)
Fuck a bitch, I'm the shit, I don't need her (I don't need her)
Fell in love with that drank and I need it
I sip out my cup and I need it (Drip)
I grew up in the rut and I seized it (Freebandz)
Sip the four of that Tuss' out in Cleveland (Let's pour up, Actavis)
They can't blame me for takin' these doses (Hold up)
Poured it raw out the pint in the Fanta (I poured it)
Tryna dodge all these scandalous heathens (Heathens)
They never gon' doubt me, now they believe me (Believe me)
They tried to forget about me, now I'm kingin'
The greatest story ever told
These pretty hoes gettin' exposed
Got my styrofoam in my hand (808)
I'm fuckin' these bands up

I'm good on that yellow, yellow (Pour up)
I'm good with that yellow, yellow (Drank)
I'm good with that red and yellow, nigga (Drank)

Walk into Barney's, I'm drinkin' on yellow
Valet the four-door, a hundred at the door, though
I speak the lingo, they know 'bout the lingo
Fuck you, lil' nigga, I'ma fill up arenas (Arenas)
Washin' that money at the cleaners (Freebandz)
It's dirty, you drink out my cup and it's dirty (Freebandz)
I come from the dirty (The dirty)
You drink out this cup and it's dirty (It's dirty)
I got codeine in my bladder (Codeine)
I get it in like a real one (One hundred)
You whippin' a Benz and they feel you (One hundred)
It's too much finnessin', you feel me? (I swear)
I went at that money, no supervision
They love me, today they gon' really feel me (They love me)
I see how they act when they playin' dirty (Playin')
Forgivin' me, never forgettin' me
I know that paper gon' be there, I stack it (Yeah)
A monster, a beast, I'm corrupted, a savage (A savage)
That 2016, gotta have it (Have it)
That bitch want Celin√©, she can get it
Pay three for that purp, if you want it, you get it
Two dollars a drink on that purp, you can get it
Fuck on me, suck on me, baby, let's pour up (808)
Fuck on me, suck on me, baby, let's pour up
I'm good on that yellow, yellow (Pour up)
