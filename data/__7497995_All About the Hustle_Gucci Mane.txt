7 ContributorsAll About the Hustle Lyrics
All about my hustle, I'm all about my hustle (It's Gucci)
I'm all about my hustle, I'm all about my hustle (Yeah)
I'm all about my hustle, I'm all about my hustle
I'm all about my hustle, I'm all about my hustle (Go)

Show me something, pay me if you owe me if you owe me some (Yeah)
Before I have to pull a Tiger Woods and put a hole in one
I'm hustlin' up the money trying to double up my actual (Yeah)
Net worth that I'm really worth, that shit they post ain't factual (It's cap)

Me and you could probably link since opposites attractable (Huh?)
'Cause I'm so rich and you so broke but that shit wouldn't be practical (Nah)
These people always ask me what I do for recreation time (Huh?)
I hustle through the holidays, I don't even get vacation time
(No)
Don't believe in wastin' time, it ain't no way replacin' time (Time)
Took some time and did the time, you took the stand and dropped the dime (Great)
My bitch is a hustler, a chick like that is hard to find (Nah)
Came so far from mixing dime, I'm hustlin' through the 165 (It's Gucci)

Show me something, pay me if you owe me if you owe me some (Yeah)
Before I have to pull a Tiger Woods and put a hole in one
I'm hustlin' up the money trying to double up my actual (Yeah)
Net worth that I'm really worth, that shit they post ain't factual (It's cap)

Big ol' golden gates, you at the Gucci Mane estates (It's Gucci)
It's money on the table, by your head, let's say the grace (Let's say the grace)
Got that sport protectin' me, them bricks I had to take (I had to take)
I know that I wasn't perfect, Lord, I know I made mistakes (Lord)
When it comes to hustlin', I go down as one of the greatest (Greatest)
Come pull up to my table, yeah, I'm passin' out the plates (Let's eat)
All my hitmen, now they peepin' out the drapes
My hustle just ain't local, now my shit move state to state (Wop)
Say you wanna be like Wop, I think your plan is great (It's great)
The difference between me and you, I came up moving weight (Wop)
Iced out like a hockey rink, but I don't even skate (Brr)
Icing on top all my bricks, they think I'm moving cake (Word)

Show me something, pay me if you owe me if you owe me some (Yeah)
Before I have to pull a Tiger Woods and put hole-in-one
I'm hustlin' up the money trying to double up my actual (Yeah)
