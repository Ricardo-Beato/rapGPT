10 ContributorsDa Glock Lyrics
Good thing we brought da Glock

It's the block party, niggas just bust shots
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Thought you had props, with your gangsta bop
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Meet me on the hill or the Ave Hill top
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
You like what you see, my shiny ass rocks
(Good thing we brought da Glock)

I'd fuck the shit out of Patricia Drummond
Looked out the window and her man was comin'
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Catch me at the Ruckers game
Playin' the side with my spaghetti chain
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Riker's Island shanked down
There go them niggas who blew Hal my nigga
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
I'm at the ATM
Niggas lookin' sneaky in the grey BM
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
You might also like
Twenty drunk crabs try to push through the back door
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Five boxcutters drawn they was ready for war
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
That's that thug down from Southside who tryin' to front son
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Little dog bout to flip, someone fucked his baby moms
(Good thing we brought da Glock)

Never leave home without it
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout it, 'bout it
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Never leave home without it
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout it, 'bout it
(Good thing we brought da Glock)

You niggas thought somethin' was sweet
Cause we rollin with the seeds today
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Back in the A-Train, Halloween
Niggas in masks, want my name ring
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
It's Brooklawn day, Pinkhouse day
Park Hill Stapleton day
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
That same cat we stomped out
Seen him at Eastern Parkway, the Parkway play
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
We in the spot where the money's marked
NARCs just jump through the window, yo
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Them niggas killin' young niggas at will
Check how they did my little man son
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
We ain't slaves, we just rich renegades that's paid
Born in the ghetto, yo
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Up in the staircase, flooded with cakes
Screwfacin' with the dirty eights
(Good thing we brought da Glock)

Never leave home without it
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout it, 'bout it
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Never leave home without it
(Good thing we brought da Glock)
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout it, 'bout it
(Good thing we brought da Glock)

Good thing we brought da Glock
