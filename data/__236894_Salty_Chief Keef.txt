25 ContributorsSalty Lyrics
You know, Sosa
This Hoodrich been on these motherfuckin' rats
It's about that cheese, they wanna get a little closer
You know, stop fuckin' with that nigga
(Scream, Scream, Scream)
Jack ass rats, you see this big money, we gettin' that huh
Y'all bitches as salty as a motherfucker
(Hoodrich)

Yeah, I get gwop now that bitch remember me
I send shots now them niggas hearin' me
Step out the cut smokin' like a chimney
I got all these racks on me now she feelin' me
She salty, she salty
She salty, she salty
She salty, she salty
She salty, she salty

100 thousand my car keys, million dollar house key
She only wanna top me, 'cause her boyfriend not me
I'm smokin' on broccoli, 'cause it's healthy for me
Plus I'm gettin' a lot of money, I ain't never hungry
Guns like Black Ops 3 if a nigga try to rob me
If a nigga try to rob me, he gon' be salty
Guns sprayin' like Oil Sheen, hollows get a nigga off me
Make me feel like Pac with me, all eyes on me
Hoes mouth drop when I ride pass 'cause my truck cost a Lamb
See this ice on my wrist and when the lights go off like damn
Ballin' so damn hard, tried to slam dunk and I broke the rim
Coughin' so damn hard put 3 grams in a blunt then I broke it down
Like "Lemme get high please, get the fuck off me"
Now I'm Almighty and I know you feel salty
Now I only speak gwopanese, play the bitch like the lottery
You can act like you ain't salty, that shit don't bother me
You might also like
Yeah, I get gwop now that bitch remember me
I send shots now them niggas hearin' me
Step out the cut smokin' like a chimney
I got all these racks on me now she feelin' me
She salty, she salty
She salty, she salty
She salty, she salty
She salty, she salty

I got all this cash, that bitch is salty
Slow down, my real bitches out there
Real bitches holdin' nigga down from day one
