3 ContributorsNotice (Know This) Lyrics
No disrespect to the rap heroes
The late, great Otis
But notice, and know this
In this time, here's a part time rhyme

Respect to you two heroes
But trickle-down got us less than zero
Respect, last I checked
Prison industrial complex, no swagger
Millions, billions, trillions, whips wheelin'
Is a million miles to what people's feelin', no gas
Try a little compassion, 2012 fashion
Style your insides, we outside
Fasten a broken seat belt, unemployed rid to Hell
SMDH, OMG, no, LOL

Have you forgotten? Latinos and Blacks
Pickin' electronic cotton, no Stax
16.2 percent is depression inside a recession
Spend money and time on hair and how we dressin'
Losin' homes, holmes, these stats be on smartphones
Don't need new slang to express the pain
Of what's really goin' on in the real game of life and now what?
Please discuss with no education
Knowledge, forty-five years of fucked up health

Teach 'em when you reach 'em

Y'all the heroes
Notice, know thisEmbed
