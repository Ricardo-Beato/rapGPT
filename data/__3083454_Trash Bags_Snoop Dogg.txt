You gotta come to freak girls right now
It's poppin', like, niggas is throwing money left to right
I say you bring that bag
Music Major

Trash bag, full of cash, full of cash

Trash bag, full of cash, full of cash

Passion, Angy, Keshia, Brandy
Tangy, paradise, obsession and candy
Lily, butterfly
What are you, what am I?
Bella, Lorraine, Linda Rose
On the stage, on the pole
Oceanate, Pina Colada
At the top, on the bottom
Ace of diamonds, keep 'em shinin'
Crazy girls, oh yeah, we got 'em
Daisy it's crazy, and so is her home girl, Red
Don't fuck around when it come around to pickin' up that bread
It's yours
