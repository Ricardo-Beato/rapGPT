7 ContributorsEmerald Butterfly Lyrics(People singing)
Bah dah bha bha bha bha bha
Bha ba da da da bhum bha bha
(repeat 2X)
(Slim Kid Tre')
You see the moon has a way with young idle minds
And idle time is the playground
Where old professions lay down
Like sweet sugar stays brown and on the mind
Gals whose whispers blow through tender lips like wind chimes
They tingle quiet ears with seductive words that I lust
And enjoy, for you fly boys to look and not touch
It ain't much but bet your dollars
Cause they holler
Without saying a thang
And she ain't saying no names
And I'm fond of an intent
Rock hard and she was skin flint
Working on a flame
It seemed like every move she made was some good ass game
I had to keep my focus tame
Cause it's a doggone shame
To see them endless
And friendless
Will us when the pride feels great
Cognac watered down to its last tender state
And emerald butterfly disappears from the skies
It seems the moon can't fight the sunrise

Feeling high, on the emerald butterfly (repeat 4X)
(Slim Kid Tre')
I was the mack of all times blowing their minds
In a world of fantasies when I'm casting my line
They would bite the bait and I would keep my ship sailing
On my crusading others would be out wading
In the water (water), more enticing than the farmer's daughter
As the imagination makes you wetter than her order
Though sweated her so tough , so rough out here
See you can't jump into the picture unless you chose to lose an ear
More nocturnal than the night itself the mystery's clear
Smears of venom all up on your denim smooth as cashmere
Steer in thoughts of feather beds and lightheadedness
Abyss it gets deeper (you know) so be a light sleeper (sleeper)
The grief is like autumn rain (autumn) washing your needs away
Now all this gold is what I need to say about glitter...
CHORUS (X2)1Embed
