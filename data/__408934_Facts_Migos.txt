11 ContributorsFacts Lyrics
Don't turn that beat down Twaun
Turn that motherfucker up, nigga
Know what I'm saying, the critics said this, they writing that, it's facts they writing though, feel me

They say you made a milli off Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you been had it
They said that young rich nigga went with global on the net
You niggas sound just like amigo, that's my lingo, that's a fact
They say you made a milli off Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you been had it
They said that young rich nigga went with global on the net
You niggas sound just like amigo, that's my lingo, that's a fact

You say that there's a new flow in the game then that's a fact
Niggas be like Takeoff you done blew up like I might be fat
Ain't no vacation in this rap 'til I see twenty platinum plaques
On the block like I might be Shaq
Bought a spauldings just check my stats
Walk in Saks with a sack
I'm fuckin' up the economy like 80' Crack
Made a mil off Versace, independent, how you do that
Caught investing in yourself with M&Ms, nigga
Made a milli but don't think we don't got M&Ms
You might also like
They say you made a milli off Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you been had it
They said that young rich nigga went with global on the net
You niggas sound just like amigo, that's my lingo, that's a fact
They say you made a milli off Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you been had it
They said that young rich nigga went with global on the net
You niggas sound just like amigo, that's my lingo, that's a fact

You niggas be talkin', you niggas be rappin'
That shit that you sayin' is not no fact
Back in the day I used to juug flats
My family proud of me no Kyla Pratt
Stomp a nigga out like I'm in a frat
You natnats bother me like a gnat
Hood bitch different color her tracks
Cookin' up chickens the babies just hatched
Fell in love with the lean I'm attached
I'm fresh and I'm dabbin', not talkin' bout wax
Fat blunts like a Louisville bat
I need all my money not takin' no slack
When you talk to a boss take off your hat
Break in these houses, free my nigga Mac
Bitches go both ways like Da Brat
You say not smokin' I make you relapse
They say you made a milli off Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you been had it
They said that young rich nigga went with global on the net
You niggas sound just like amigo, that's my lingo, that's a fact
They say you made a milli off Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you been had it
They said that young rich nigga went with global on the net
You niggas sound just like amigo, that's my lingo, that's a fact4Embed
