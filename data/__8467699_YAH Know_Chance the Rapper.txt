25 ContributorsYAH Know Lyrics
Know, know, know, how will I? (Sɛ wo nim dada)
How will I know, know, know (King Promise ni Chance the Rapper)
Know, know, know, how will I know?
How will I know?

You'll know when ya get there
Yah know when I end up on a new track
You'll go when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when ya go
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when ya go

Gun to ya back like Harriet
If you can't shoot, can't carry it
If ya too fake, can't ferry it
Comе carry me home, sweet chariot
Er'body wanna come drivе the boat
But nobody wanna come paddleboat
If we realized we was all compatible
We could combine the money
Maybe come buy the boat
Sometimes, I'm my boss
Sometimes gun might bust (Bust)
Freedom is a must, in Yah we trust
Hold my hand if you scared, hold my hand if you cried
Hold my hand and I'll drive, close your eyes and I'll steer
I'm not woke, I'm just tired
I'm not floatin', I'm flyin'
I'm not broken, I'm fine
I'm outspoken, I stay on code when I'm out in the open online
They gon' know what we know in no time
They gon' go in the show with no line
With a pick for a comb, and clothes, the whole nine
Better hold on tight, no time to slow down
Don't ask, "Are we there?", you slept the whole time
You might also like
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know, go
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know, you'll know
You'll know when we get there, you'll know when we get there
You'll know, you'll know
You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it

Front to the back, get loud
Ones in the back, get loud
Run and the gun click, pow
One big crowd (One big crowd)
One big smile (One big smile)
Money in one big pile
Blueprints in an unzipped file
Akwaaba medasee, that's the end of my speech
Tell 'em, "Spread the word from Osu to Kumasi"
This for Dr. Kwame, Selassie and Nnamdi
Tell 'em, "Free the youth, or we gon' free the army"
Pray no man can harm me, can't no man can harm me
I can't let you starve me, I can't go out like Gandhi
Bet, say less, bro, we on the way
Starline fest, ho, we on the way
Better open that whole damn street on the way
'Fore it look like World War Z on the gate
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
(You'll know when we get there, you'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there (You'll know, you'll know, you'll know, you'll know)
We almost there, we almost down, it's almost down

Let me take y'all back like Marcus
When Europe was still in the darkness
The boats was big as the arc is
The cargo was gold-tipped spears and it sold by the load and it opened the market
Before currency, the Canary Current made trade and maize was the hardest
Back to the wall like the artists
I leaned on the crib like a mortgage
I breathed on the game like a cartridge
I'm sorry, I mean it never started
Chano got the keys to the starship
With his heart on his sleeve like a card trick
Goin' back to the sea like a warship
Then I'm back to the sand like a starfish
When I'm on, but you don't always have to hit the streets
We must fight, but you must fight to go protect our peace
And I'm your rival when you ride, you'll get some sleep
And we gon' mob, but when we mob, it be lil' more discreet

You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
(You'll know when we get there)
(You'll know when we get there)
(You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there
Let me say
Leave in the mornin'
We gon' leave in the mornin'
We gon' leave in the mornin'

At the break of dawn, we gon' make a break
We gon' take the farm
Take the safe, we finna break the bank
We replaced the tapes, and made fake alarms
The home team waitin', know we comin' over
Got a Sauvignon blanc with the two cigars
'Case you was stoppin' to loot the bar
We got valet waitin' with a souped-up car
Got a nitro boost for the chasin'
Got a few rooms booked at the Days Inn
Got a lil' bit of Mase and a lil' bit of cash
Just in case catch a glimpse of the faces
Good God, this the heist for the ages
From the cages, straight to the majors
Liberation, you gotta take it
Free yourself, learned that from the Haitians
Smile through the tears, learned that from a crocodile
Speak your mind like a pocket dial
Got fully-auto rocket power
So any damn door, it'll knock it down
Just call my phone when you make it down
Just give me a piece when you break it down
Cullinan diamond, I'ma take the crown
'Cause when I take the crown, I'ma break the crown
You'll know when I get there

I don't wanna think too much, don't wanna think about it
But I know we will get there (You'll know)
I don't wanna think too much, don't wanna think about it
But I know you'll get there, yeah

You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
Yah know, yah know
You'll know, you'll know
Yah know, yah know
Yah know, yah know
Yah know, yah know
Chano, Chano
Yah know, yah know
Yah know
Chano, Chano2Embed
