192 ContributorsRed Dot Music Lyrics

Yeah
Haha

Uh, think I can see a fuckin' halo (Halo), about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano (Drano), some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbor with the bitches, he got special needs (Sheesh)
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe (Please)
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored (Tailored), me and Action rappin'
Al be fuckin' with the fader (Fader), sippin' mind eraser
Actually, we rappin' for the fuck of it
Takin' money from you, gonna smack you out in public
You the Republican government
Abundance of substance, have a consumption to fuck a bitch (*Woman moans*)
With your Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch lookin' like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit (Woo)
(I said it must be the drugs)
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
(I said it must be the drugs)
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty-fifth
(I said it must be the drugs)
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
(I said it must be the drugs)
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit
(I said it must be the drugs)
Lookin' up into the clouds where the angels sit
(I said it must be the drugs)
They lookin' down, keepin' watch 'til I'm dead
(I said it must be the drugs)
So how'd I get this red dot on my head? (My head)
(I said it must be the drugs)
You might also like
Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first (Never)
After rappin', take my people out for octopus (Spanish)
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam (Uh, uh)
Don't hold your hand out for nothin' if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peelin' off a whip like when your mother strip (Strip)
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip (King Crack)
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hands are fuckin' hotter than the leather in the six in the summertime (Uh)
Understand I'm only rhymin' for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede Puma
My look is Jay Buhner, doggy, â€˜cause some of us just age sooner (I'm goin', man)
I'm still twisted, rockin' lizards from a strange river (River)
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio (Bio)
I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit (Woo)
(I said it must be the drugs)
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
(I said it must be the drugs)
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
(I said it must be the drugs)
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
(I said it must be the drugs)
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit
(I said it must be the drugs)
Lookin' up into the clouds where the angels sit
(I said it must be the drugs)
They lookin' down, keepin' watch 'til I'm dead
(I said it must be the drugs)
So how'd I get this red dot on my head? (My head)
(I said it must be the drugs)
Uh, uh
Bitch, I'm noddin' off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly givin' y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor chasin' after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops (Stoops) to smokin' on roofs (Roofs)
I came from that basement, now look at this view (View)
Makin' this money (Money), blowin' it all (All)
Fuck what you did (Did), just show me results (Results)

Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses, I led 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money, but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfuckin' fakin' that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat!

I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs

You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says "Crack dealin' trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You-hoo! I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you "beastie," boy
You can't match a killer with that, wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey roll
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You a bully's best day ever, with them Nike's on your feet
Comin' through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga, give me that shit!
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?81Embed
