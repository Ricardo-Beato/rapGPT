Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills
When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?
I don't know what you gotta do when life gets you down
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming
Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming
Dory, no singing
What do we do? We swim
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho, I love to swim
Dory, Dory
When you want to swim
Oh, okay. Where? Oh, you want me to sit right here? Where, look right there? Okay, okay, alright. I got it. Well... well, hello folks, Darnell Boat here. Today, I'ma tell you a little story about my two nephews, Lil Yachty and Lil Boat. Well, I don't know where to start. Look, here's Lil Boat now
Lil Boat!
Okay
I've got these strange voices inside my head
Keep a stack and .380 beside my bed
Not to be cool, but in case they run up on me
If y'all bet on my fam, clutch with double on me
Went to school on a dirt road with black hoes and potholes
This shit was just then, this was four months
Late nights with gang on them store hunts
Loitering Walmart for pure fun
Look at me now, all of my classmates like, "Wow"
My teachers like, "Damn"
I remember I didn't have not a fan
Now I step out and Lil Boat is the man
Woah, this shit is surreal
Pockets stuffed in with blue bills
So much people trying to ask how it feels
But, nigga, I don't know
Everyday I ball like finger roll (woo!)
How'd you do it? Only God knows (oh!)
I want to know who's real until the time folds
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause I'm wearing nicer clothes
I'ma stay down with the same niggas I came up with, that's the master plan
26 for a nigga hand, diamonds so cold you might need a fan (woo!)
I don't know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse, I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
'Cause I'm young as fuck and I'm rich as hell
Pants low like I'm fresh in jail
But I've been out, motherfuck 12 (woo!)

See, he's a little--he's a little bit more aggressive. Well, you know, as this story unfolds, and you know what I'm saying, as the story gets told, uh, I'll tell you a little bit more about Yachty. He's a little bit nicer. Let's call him
Hello? Hello?
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, hello
Hello, hello
Oh, hello
Hello Boat, it's so nice to meet you
I'm so glad you came
Hello, hello
What's poppin'? It's Lil Yachty, I'm in the party
I need three thotties to come suck on my posse
What's poppin'? Woah
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Oh, hello
Welcome to my life
Hello, hello, hello8Embed
