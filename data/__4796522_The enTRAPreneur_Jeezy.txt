15 ContributorsThe enTRAPreneur Lyrics
Fear is not an option
I prefer to lose
I sometimes secretly hope that my companies go out of business to zero
I lose everything and all of you write things on social media that I actually suck and was full of shit
And then in the dirt, with a fuckin'— the pain
I'ma rise like a fuckin' phoenix and kill all you motherfuckers
I mean it, yeah
Yeah

Straight up out my mother (Mother), straight to the gutter (Gutter)
You can trap, you can die, one or the motherfuckin' other (This what you been waitin' on?)
Yeah, I sold dope to both of my uncles, should be ashamed (Ashamed)
Then my cousin Niecy went in my room and stole my change (Damn)
One day I had my four-door Bentley, I need some legroom
But right now I'm stuck in this trailer with two bedrooms (Yeah)
My cousin Jo Jo gave me a pack, he tried to slave me (Slave me)
My nigga Silk showed me the game, he tried to save me (Ayy)
What you know about the first and the third? My anniversary ('Versary)
So many formula babies we need a nursery (Ha-haa)
My nigga Ro taught me to whip it, I'm tryna learn somethin' (Learn somethin')
Never been with takin' and shit, I'm tryna earn somethin' (Ayy)
Young kingpin on Madden, just ask Floss (You ain't know?)
Thirty days, I've been up a month with no coffee (Damn)
Thank God I got my receipts, I paid the price
Nightmare starrin' the prosecutor, they gave me life, yeah (Ayy)
Put that on my sister, my mama, waved at Madonna (Ha-haa)
You are listenin' to an entrepreneur in Dolce Gabanna (Ayy)
Self-made is my understandin', let's get it understood
Left the hood and came back with a feast, they call me Robin Hood (Yeah)
Swear to God I didn't even cry, ayy, when my granny died (Ayy)
"Boy, you better get up and get it" (Get it), star in my granny's eyes (Yeah)
All you niggas thinkin' it's easy, go 'head and try it, then (Try it, then)
You gon' need you some theme music, you hear my violins? (Ayy)
Streets were dead, I dropped my first album, I gave 'em life (Life)
Motivation then I dropped inspiration, I done it twice (Yeah)
Sold a few quarters in plastic, I gave 'em class (Recession, nigga)
Nigga served a few on the take, that closed casket (Ayy)
That street nigga touchin' them millions, buyin' them buildings (Buildings)
Nigga sellin' water, tequila (Avión, nigga), might touch some billions (Damn)
America, they label us dealers, that's the allure (Allure)
But the hood, yeah, they label us heroes, entrepreneurs (Yeah)

I think you should buy Wheaties
Right
For, like, like— I'm being serious
F'real, f'real
Like, that's what I think you can do
I think a lot of kids are gonna make money
You're an entrepreneur
Like, when I look at you, I look at you f—
I look at you "Entrepreneur, comma, artist"
