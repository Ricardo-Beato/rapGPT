15 ContributorsHave My Baby Lyrics
(WichoBeatz)
Only thing I wanna know is can you... my baby, my baby
My baby, my baby?
(LkOnTheBeat)
Only thing I wanna know is can you have my baby, my baby?
(Domeno)
My baby, my baby
(Intelonthebeat)

When you put on your makeup, you drive me crazy
Make me think I wanna have a baby
Where'd you come from, with all these statements?
Only thing I wanna know is, can you have my baby, my baby
My baby, my baby?
Only thing I wanna know is ,can you have my baby, my baby
My baby, my baby?
Only thing I wanna know is, can you have my baby?

Can you have my baby?
Don't look crazy
What we gon' name it?
Beamer Mercedes
Let's make some arrangements
Let's have an wrangler
Or ballet dancing
Can you hit my blunt? Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
But it gon' kill you, and I need you to have my baby
Baby, baby, baby
Keep my kid up and you can have money blowing like an AC
AC, AC, AC
I know I be on that hot stuff but my neck cold like a ICEE
A ICEE, ICEE, ICEE
She don't want no kids with no other nigga 'cause ain't no nigga like me
You might also like
When you put on your makeup, you drive me crazy
Make me think I wanna have a baby
Where'd you come from, with all these statements?
Only thing I wanna know is, can you have my baby, my baby
My baby, my baby?
Only thing I wanna know is ,can you have my baby, my baby
My baby, my baby?
Only thing I wanna know is, can you have my baby?Embed
