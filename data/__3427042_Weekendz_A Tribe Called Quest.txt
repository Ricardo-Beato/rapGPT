5 ContributorsWeekendz Lyrics

Check it out
Her name was Knick-Knack-Patty-Wack, her ass smokin' bones
Yo, I've been on the throne since was walkin' stoned
Got the same job, pimpin' these slugs like Freddie Foxxx
I'm loungin' on the block on some brand new like Thomasina
Step in my arena and get murked like Selena
'Cause once you go 'Quence, you never go back like Ed
I rip shit to make crews bounce like great head
You open like you dusted
I be reppin' for more bad guys  than when you're a tussler
And when it comes to chicken, son, I'm Phifer dude
The Fresh Prince of Linden, you could lick my crown jewels
And black, you know I never slack in the mack
'Cause Razor been through more ladies than Big Kap
And when it comes to willie, pull your Hanes up
L for us, we come strapped

Yo, we stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me

Yo, boom, I ain't Game Boy, or a bunch of ladies' man
My Tribe got more wins than Indians in Cleveland
I keep chicken seasoned, got rap on lock like the precinct
I'm the reasoning that Janet wants to runaway
Okay? So watch whatcha say like Chaka
We don't half-step, we bring it to your snot locker
And I got a style Praswell ain't ready for
Graduate of 5-1-6 so I could drink away the pain like ready for
We runnin' up in spots and more addresses than Gettysburg, ya heard?
Yo, I be a tough act to follow, get the cheese like nacho
Naw'mean, Pancho? I'm on some fly like Tom Hanks in Apollo
So Linden Boulevard, is you wit' me like Puba?
We rockin' diamond links like this is only built for Cuba
I'm on some brand new like Oprah's hairdo
And when I come through, niggas know my stee
Representin' for Queens and LB, to have a million dollar dream, baby

We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, splurging Louis on the weekends
We stack the cheese
Stay holding and we decent
Ladies loving me, loving me, loving me
