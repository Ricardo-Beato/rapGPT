Watch cost 'bout a Bentley
And my ring cost 'bout a brick

I'm the man, goddamn, I'm the man
Feature price so high, you need a layaway plan
Your girlfriend made me call you and said stay away, man
She easy as a freethrow so you fade away fast
My ring cost 'bout a brick, my watch cost 'bout a Benz
Your main chick on my dick, she let me smash her friends
My earrings are so cold, they look like they on fire
You think your stones are colder, I think that you a liar
I hold court in the streets, I'm the judge so bring my jewelry
And ain't no one gon' take it so no need to get insurance
My chain cost 'bout a Bentley and my trunk cost 'bout a Phantom
I'm the King of East Atlanta and I'm shining like a lemon

Watch cost 'bout a Bentley
And my ring cost 'bout a brick

You know my time is my money, my money is my time
And I ain't wasting either, so have it on your mind
I shine like a diamond with the cuts of a princess
Ya bitch call me daddy when I fuck her like it's incest
Oooo how , why you standing close to her
You should be like me and let her go just like you supposed to, bruh
Put her on a poster, a flyer and a bottle
 in a minute while you high-steppin your prada
I'm all about a dollar if you with me gon' n' holla'
She's a spitter, I ain't wit' her, you gotta roll or swalla'
Or we can't talk money, we can't chop green
Or convo' about the cabbage if you know what I mean
You might also like
Watch cost 'bout a Bentley
And my ring cost 'bout a brick

Watch me kick it on these suckers like judo
Motley swag's on jones, catch me off in Pluto
All hoes still gon' ice this track, the new hoes
Still the same won't catch me in that thang unless it's two doors
Bitch got on my old dough, now I got new dough
Still spending '90, '91, and '92 dough
Hoes like Alaska we the coldest niggas' you know
Everybody have Breitlings, said fuck it, bought a Hublot
Audemar Piguet, I'm getting cake, how 'bout you though?
Favorite food chicken, still heavy eating noodles and butter
Gucci, Bun, and Rocko, need I say more?
We the victors, go kiss my ring, whore

Watch cost 'bout a Bentley
And my ring cost 'bout a brick1Embed
