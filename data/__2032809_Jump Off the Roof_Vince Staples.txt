What's your addiction, baby?
Love can make a bitch go crazy
Kiss, hug, fuck, and then get faded
Fall out, and it's all-out war
Head twirl, and your vision blurrin'
Dopeman in that kitchen stirrin'
Sold it, we so lit, dope burners
Fuck is you so forgetful for?
Girl, you know that you need that raw
Girl, you know that you need Visine
Preem laced with that cocaín'
Pop a pill, pop what's in them jeans
Cop a feel, cop a half-sixteen
Pour a deuce up, and then start leaning
Tryna die higher than Pimp C
And Big Moe, you know how the shit go
(You know how the shit go)

I pray to God 'cause I need Him
I need Him, I need Him
Cocaine withdrawals, and I'm fiending
I'm fiending, I'm fiending
Life way too hard, am I dreaming?
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Highway to Hell, and I'm speeding
One way to tell if I'm breathing
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof

Baby girl, love me, I'll love you back
Just don't turn your back on me
Though I'm borderline crazy, mama, crack baby
Seizures come when I sleep
So just hold my hand, darling
Don't wanna be a part of your problem
Just wanna sleep without my lungs stopping, like they used to
I hate when you lie, I hate the truth, too
Can't wait 'til you die, I hate that we through
Fuck around and get a man
Leave him dead where he stand with the blam
I ain't playing with a motherfucker
I was raised at the end of the land with the surf and the sand
Get a tan in this motherfucker
Wanna feel how you feel, if it's mine and it's real
Then it's fine, baby girl, I don't need a rubber
Nothing wrong in the world with another mother
(You know how the shit go)

I pray to God 'cause I need Him
I need Him, I need Him
Cocaine withdrawals, and I'm fiending
I'm fiending, I'm fiending
Life way too hard, am I dreaming?
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Highway to Hell, and I'm speeding
One way to tell if I'm breathing
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
If I told you that I love you, would you care?
If I said I need you, would you be right there?
If I told you, that I love you, would you care?
If I said I need you, would you be right there? Be right there
You know how the shit go

I pray to God 'cause I need Him
I need Him, I need Him
Cocaine withdrawals, and I'm fiending
I'm fiending, I'm fiending
Life way too hard, am I dreaming?
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Highway to Hell, and I'm speeding
One way to tell if I'm breathing
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof27Embed
