Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
What you say? Oh, you haven't? Alright, wait, bitch

Two-phone Baby Keem, fuck you mean? I am here, ho
Ice cream, booger colored piss, Sub-Zero
No ho hookers in my clique, we don't fear, ho
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit
I gotta wait
I gotta politic, I got a bae
Ain't no apologies when I get paid
A dermatologist, I want the face
Don't talk to me when I stomp in this bitch, ho, ho
Pussy watery, I duck the tuna fish, ho, ho
Yeah, uh, these niggas actin' like groupie, huh
Lil' bitch, she wanna get mad 'cause I keep on lookin' all in her booby, huh
I got the furniture options, my U-Haul moving coochie to coochie, huh
I buy the toe when I shop it, rock band on toosie, now I look spooky, huh, huh
Easy there, boy
Shit get greedy there, boy
I rep pg there, boy
My gang need me there, boy
If my sex tape leak, your bitch on TV there, boy
Watch her please me there, boy (Lil' baby get on my nerves)
Shit get greedy there, boy (Lil' baby get on my nerves)
I must admit, I am a mess, I cannot fix it, mm
Lil' baby thick, Margiela sweats, look at my dick print, mm
Fuck all the rats, if you confess, that is a big hit, huh
Fuck all the rats, if you confess, it get addressed, bitch
