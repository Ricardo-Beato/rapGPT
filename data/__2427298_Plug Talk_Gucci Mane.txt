Burn One, Burn One
(This is another raw beats production)
Sheah sheah, sheah, yeah, Gucci, Gucci huh huh huh hah
Guccarachi baby, Gucci Gucci, sheah, Cocaina shawty

When I see my plug, this how I talk to him
And when I serve my folks, this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dawgs this how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm finna talk to 'em

My guala, my partna, mota mañana, gracias de nada, guap millions of dollars
¿Qué pasa, amigo? Cocaine muy bonito, cocina mucho
Es grande on the leafo, ese El Pablo
My barrio, yo barrio, comprende, my friende
You speak real good engle, 600 Wednesday, 5000 Tuesday
El nombre es Gucci, no puto no pussy, Coronas and kushy
Kilos and elbows, chicos señoritos, they come from Mexico, there he go
20 tacos and it got me 50 burritos, S550 Mercedes on Flat Shoals
¿Qué pasa, mañana? My guala-guala, my partna-partna
Love to treat a nigga to steak and lobster, now a nigga owe him a million dollars
Got me makin' 10 Gs an hour, money is power, time is money
You don't know the nigga that serve the dummy, serve the junkies then ride Asantis

When I see my plug, this how I talk to him
And when I serve my folks, this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dawgs this how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm finna talk to 'em

With the bomboclats my trap-spot, dreadlocks and rastas
Rude boys and rude girls, jamaican mobsters
I shot the sheriff, smokin' Bob Marley
All of this Ecstasy is killin' me softly
Turgo and curry, mid grade so pretty
6 spot my X spot, can't dodge the red dot
Smokin' the lala, can't get no higher
Where is me iya? Chiefin' the fire
Where is me lighter? look at me ice-uh
Step up your neckpiece, I like your wife-uh
I pack a rifle, I loves me life-uh
Put up your hands before I put up my rifle

When I see my plug, this how I talk to him
And when I serve my folks, this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dawgs this how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm finna talk to 'em
When I see my plug, this how I talk to him
And when I serve my folks, this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dawgs this how I talk to 'em

What's up nigga, what it do? I'm good my nigga, how are you?
Half a chicken, whole chicken, quarter chicken, what it move?
Bentley coupe on Bentley shoes, hell nah them ain't 22's
Still keep coke in inner tubes, plottin' on my next business move
26 inch tennis shoes, old school paint it Maserati blue
Brought my gun but forgot my roof, pullin' up with your baby boo
Ooh ooh it's you know who, it's last call, baby, what you gonna do?
Lookin' for somethin' thick I can screw, pack change and my diamonds too
Trap nigga watch me remindin' you, my grill and ring be blindin' you
If you a stuffin' artist I'm signin' you, I'm still the black nigga that be shinin' too
Trap nigga, watch me remindin' you, my grill and ring be blindin' you
If you a stuffin' artist I'm signin' you, I'm still the black nigga that be shinin' too, bitch

And when I serve my folks, this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dawgs this how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane La Flare, I'm finna talk to 'em
When I see my plug, this how I talk to him
And when I serve my folks, this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dawgs this how I talk to 'em
