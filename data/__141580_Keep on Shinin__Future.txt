100 racks, no diamonds
I don't know where my mind went
I can't tell what the time is, I just keep on shining
100 racks, no diamonds
I don't know where my mind went
I can't tell what time it is, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining

I just keep on grinding, stacking up my lumber
I just keep getting' money, I put that on my mama
Rackin' up them Benjamins, I blast off like Jetsons
Plugged in with the Haitians, I keep it real with my Mexicans
Belt by Ferragamo, shoes by Chanel
Cook that good dope and I can eyeball a bale
Crooked bitch, my Rolly, flooded my wrist is
Sauce on my shoe game, put sauce on my bitches
Audemar is stainless, ain't got no diamonds
Everything around me, just can't even stop shining
Shine like my young niggas
They ride with a hundred rounds nigga
On the court, no violence
But you ain't 'bout to take mine, nigga
You might also like
100 racks, no diamonds
I don't know where my mind went
I can't tell what the time is, I just keep on shining
100 racks, no diamonds
I don't know where my mind went
I can't tell what time it is, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining

Big rocks - Fred Flintstone
Catch me burning rubber when I leave my jeweler
Michael Jackson high, call me Thriller
Playin' poker for a hundred bands, I'm the dealer
Casino – Ex Drug Dealer
Put the rocks around my neck, I call it ice
Put the stash 'round my wrist, that's that china white (sorry)
I don't skimp on jewels, bought a lot of ice (Freebandz!)
Fuck wrong with you? Think I ain't got no cash?
G and Future with me, know I got that pack
A hundred thousand for the car, no tags
Shine on everything, see him through the glass
100 racks, no diamonds
I don't know where my mind went
I can't tell what the time is, I just keep on shining
100 racks, no diamonds
I don't know where my mind went
I can't tell what time it is, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining

Spend a hundred racks on blue jeans, got good weed, got good lean
Got five cars they all foreign, got foreign bitches in my cockpit
Got thirty chains, got thirty rings, ever since the gang moved 30 a year
I turnt up, I blanked out, now I'm banked up with a blank check
Drop top with no head on it, that's brain-dead, family
My car cranked without no key
I'm turnin' up, you go to sleep
I whipped me up that V12
I pull up in that V12
I got a hundred bands in my email
I'm on the yacht, no sea shells
On tough sand I touch bands
A Cayenne, an Expedition, I fill 'em up with a bunch of fishes
High tops, no lace up
My mind stay on stacks
My niggas movin' them packs
I ran the stacks like tracks
And I ain't never gon look back
100 racks, no diamonds
I don't know where my mind went
I can't tell what the time is, I just keep on shining
100 racks, no diamonds
I don't know where my mind went
I can't tell what time it is, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining5Embed
