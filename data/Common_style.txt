Yeah, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo

I never knew a luh-luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light, but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort, I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close.. to the Most High
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
You might also like
It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch, or even my boo
There's so much in a name, and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anythin'
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anythin' worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh, darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

I'll take my chances
Before they pass
Pass me by, oh, darling
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree46Embed

I rap with the passion of Christ, nigga, cross me
Took it out of space and niggas thought they lost me
I'm back like a chiroprac' with b-boy survival rap
It ain't ninety-fo' Joe, we can't go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired, I'mma takeover
Tell these halftime niggas break's over
I'm raw, hustlas get your baking soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and they faith over
It's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement, listening to tapes of Ultra-
Magnetic, to the fact the messiah is black
I'll turn the TV down, we can take it higher than that
I wonder if these whack niggas realize they whack
And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christians
Pushin' cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city
The city, the city, the city, the city

A black figure, in the middle with chaos and gunfire
So many raps about rims, surprised niggas ain't become tires
On the street you turn cold and then go screech
I tell 'em "fuck 'em" like I do to police
The beast is runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryin' to have sex that's tantric
For the ghetto, tryin' to make a get-up stand-up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich?
I slap a nigga like you, and tell him "Rick James bitch!"
With your Hollywood stories, on porches
We polly hood stories about who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com', has never been involved wit' run
Unless it's DMC, or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip-hop is goin', it's Chicago-in
Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'
It's the city, the city, y'all

Common Sense, from the city of wind9Embed
Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do
Huh, yeah

Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

I wonder if the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speaks
I'm keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seekin' it with 'em
I'm dope, the streets need me to hit 'em
With some of that (Revolutionary rap) revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guys pack heat, enough to bury June
On my feet, I'm getting married soon
Walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifthteens of the Jeep that you boom
Sonned so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Oshun, hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building, I'm the doorman
Opening doors, my blood I expose on the floors
Tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
A poster shines of me holding the blinds
Mixing goldenseal and wine, holding a nine

Between churches and liquor stores, my mic meets
With raps all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy, Joe, remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over waters
That's as troubled as teens for the love of the team
Trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The Black pool of genius'll never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replenish the Earth
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods, from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first

Night blows, stoves don't work, hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Trippin' off heights, wishin' for nights in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies
Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae
With weight so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto
This is Chicago in the heyday
Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was JJ
A skinny nigga, young girls with Penny figures
So many niggas, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they on
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good workin' with my hands
My generation never understood workin' for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

Life and death flow around us
Four pounds and pounds of herb from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from Earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth
Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike
She got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team

Phone rang
Screen said caller ID blocked
But for some reason, I decided to answer it
On the other end, was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years
But spending these last two days with his momma and his kid
When he spoke, I wasn't trying to hear it
Cause I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he had done
He said now it's time for him to turn himself in
For no longer could he run, from life, from God
I started thinkin, "Why is doin' right is so hard?"
I thought back to when we was in London
Discussin' the New Testament, and how our lives related to it
And how we could make the best of it
My voice became desperate, so I asked him, "Why you gotta go?"
He said, "You know, turn to Matthew 24"
He said, "No one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near; don't let anything lead you astray
As long as God is with me, everything will be okay"
So right about then, we decided to pray

What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad, call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We layed under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard tryna understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill from her grill
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me, "Hold me", a story she assembled it
Tellin' it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love makin'
When she was eight, she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only through men, through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you
You might also like
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Still could be heard, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me

She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't concieve her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year, she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early, would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave, does the mind go?
Watchin' Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors, there's no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you, between me and you
Between me and you, between me and you
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Still could be heard, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me

He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was instilled
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
'Til his spirit yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now it was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him?
Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you, between me and you
Between me and you, between me and you
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Still could be heard, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me

Liberation, peace1Embed
Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I (I) I (oh I)
I, appreciate what you give to me, yeah
(I) I (oh I)
I, appreciate what you give to me, yeah

People say I got soul, look at all the records I hold
The lives I've affected, connect and control
With me in your basement your mama got blowed
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old, bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, some cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap with them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Be the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high, when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes
I am music

I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies with your lows and highs
Open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station that's hot, you can't stop my heat
I taught Jay and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today, yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo, you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived, yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me, women cry, and children dance
I'm tryna eat, I coulda got a meal and ran

Beginning of time, yo, beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times, yo, at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when you're riding smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blown with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go, I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pop's collection
Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing
Yo, I am music

Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?

You are my queen, but I can't ignore the freak

Hold on, gotta get the toiletries

Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What He showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

She walk into the court, her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive, he needn't hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla, so she loved him
Looked at the jury, how can they judge him?
She screamed

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away (Uh)
Before you lock my love away (Yeah), before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

Fear in her chest, her face with tears
Had her man's back, he was facing years
In her name, though the place was his
They tryna take everything except the kids
For years she been through scuffle and fights
While he tryna hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried, she bubbled inside and screamed

Before you lock my love away (Uh), before you lock my love away (Yeah)
Before you lock my love away (Yeah), before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

The judge yelled for order court
Reporter making her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him
She could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder and gun possession
As they read back her confession, she screamed
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away (Uh)
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts, tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking, looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind, testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away

Nigga breathe, I can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no more, so off me you feed
I hustle at a speed between greed and need
On the streets where intuition and weed are breed
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
My rhyme the clip, it's like the boom bip to tip
In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way
Spending nights over Egypt to learn a brave day
Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ
You're the Ray J of this rap world
I travel the globe with a black girl named Becky
Grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed, the law can't arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt like Jesse
Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See through, tryna out act Don Cheadle
I speak to original Hebrews, you know how we do
And bleed through the needle with truth
That needs no preview to proof, it's in the people
And how they react, still in the business of smacking
Rappers is wack, you had a dope track, I guess opposites attract
My mind state is black, black like Bernie Mac

I see niggas with flags, who they waving them for?
I'm the nigga, that you put the chain on the door for
The nigga, that you started changing the laws for
Orator of hardcore and more
My raps the portal for the blue collar
You made a hit and came up on a few dollars
I'd rather listen to silence than you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made Dear Mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
For truth your a decoy
Common Sense is like the future of the B-boy
I fall down and get up like Don McClurkin
Hit push and listen to it whistle while I'm twerkin'
Break it down like herb

You ain't ready for war, you're stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I've been wanting to fly so now I do it with the words

Children by the window with the gun cocked
They cooking the raw to start to lump knots
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots

Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path, I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered? You forgot the mission

Didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent off in backyards
Wishing in the air for a black god
Where the people fix cars and clap hard
And look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
That master anger, and ain't afraid to shoot
Through poured liquor, fallen angels they salute
(Whew! Whew!) Feel the wind blow
A new wave, people with they hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This new age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels, who rock heavy metals
And tell them that they pharaoh so let go

From a school that's old, bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, some cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap with them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Be the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high, when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes
I am music

I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies with your lows and highs
Open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station that's hot, you can't stop my heat
I taught Jay and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today, yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo, you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived, yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me, women cry, and children dance
I'm tryna eat, I coulda got a meal and ran
But like Sly for the fam, still I stand

Beginning of time, yo, beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times, yo, at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when you're riding smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blown with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go, I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pop's collection
Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing
Yo, I am music
Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day

And I Blossom, In Colour is how I'm Living see
Some pretend to be afraid of me but they're my Public Ene-ma
Picture this, like a cinema; I'm winning a contest
I knew you was a loser when you bought your girl's prom dress
I'm just, another one of the nigs, take a swig
I can sing, brothers'll work it out without a gig
The gold mud in my blood, I'm a stud smoking blunts
Not a fuddy dud if rhymes were pecks, I'd be Woody Wood
They're after pestly hoes and that's the hoes I sex and don't collects
Rocking a Rolex, preferring sex instead of Soloflex
But I pump skill, to build what I can build and still feel good
The baddest hoes be saying, "Oooh you're real good"
Fella a city dweller, it's poison salmonella
Auntie's name is Stella, style as def/deaf as Helen Keller
Nail a flammer with the Hammer for coming incorrect
Not with his grammar or bad mamma jama similar, to Bruce Banner
So don't get me angry, or maybe you won't like me

Like Georgie Pudding Pie but baby baby don't, cry
Feed em I heat em and eat em if I don't need em then I leave em
As leftovers, packing the weak MC's into ?septober?
Til I was older, I couldn't hold a rhyme folder
Now I dare ya to try and knock this mic off my shoulder
If I'm sober I won't hold a skunk, but when I'm drunk
I might let her bunk in my bed, heads be saying I'm a hunk
Like a duck I'm slamming ham MC's MC's I'm serving
Making the people jump like my man... Julius Erving!!!
Those deserving props are gonna get theirs
Grip, there's something on your lip, oh that's my dick hairs
I'm the biggedy biggedy Bear ya scrub Cub with a demo tape
Trying to catch me catch your breath before you hyperventilate
For air you're gasping, your best bet is to take an aspirin

My eyes watch God from a place, where times is hard
Hard times we embrace, everybody want a yard
Cause a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan, the hustle is hollerin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollar and
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to profit like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean John modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle

Just put it in your back and hustle
The paper's stacked so hustle
Gon', gon' get it, get me that
Gon', gon' get it, get me that
Just move and shake and grind and hustle

To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toy
So he can come, so just work, murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Everytime you see a head in my lap, you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me
To do my duty, only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white, AND1 new sneaks

Walking up and then down the strip
Looking for some hip so I can skip
I spotted this honeydip, and her friend tried to sell me a script
That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the OLD Gus
So I'm getting a bus, as I thrill at the disgust
Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business
Dippin from a distance, in an instance I got the digits
And blew a kiss to her
(THAT OLD STANK HOEEEE) was mad I didn't speak to her
I hooked up with the one that looked NICE
Took her mind, like an ICE
'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill
They told her to keep that booty still
I been through more hoes than the pill
Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete (UHH)
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (BREAK)
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was getting knocked
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell
Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat
Like a belt, everything was strapped
'til my homey asked, "WASSUP WIT DAT?"
The dat was like dis G, I told him I got busy
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy
THAT WAS FOUL, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end
The little red Corvette that locked the door and I can't get in
No more no more no more and now I know and now I know
Don't mess around with CB's, good buddy, ten-fo'

Victory won in a world of Hennessy and guns
Too young for the marches, but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles
We fought for ours, caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is
I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, do dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it

Living once again (Hey)

Look fear in the eyes and say, "I'm never gon' run"
Sooner or later I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree, by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gangbang to maintain
'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the ride I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song

Origin is forever
Well, well, well, here we are back in the studio again
Look at that
I— hey, I don't need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin' up cue cards
What's that say— What that say?
Oh, they say, just talk, don't sing
Son, I bet you feel like you and I've been here forever, huh?
Through these old red eyes, beholding red eyes
I see my world's tears
Yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have two valleys
Hopeful eyes in the comfort
Of true protection and admiration of a child
That's forever
Forever is to strive
The pace of endearment
Forever
Forever is what I leave
My I-self contribution
Damn, what I'm gon' leave?
Okay, I'll leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand
To the universal scales of humanity, all humanity
Forever is finding a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, hurricanes following the trails of the African slave ships
War, war, and more war
Floods, Columbine, global warming, earthquakes
Another somebody done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech is not a, "Oh, what the heck?"
Which scale did you place your one grain of spiritual sand forever?
Confusion need a solution
Blend and stir, stir and blend the pot of humanity
Sift the ingredients
Of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atonement
We gon' work with the four A's here
Forever, Pops
Common good is forever
God's memory is forever2Embed

Tch-a-ch-tchk, c'mere boy, I said it's play-time
It's time to play with the mind of a slimmie
I don't wanna be a freak, but it's the dog in me
I don't pretend to be the open door roses type
I open the door for myself, and I close it right
In your face, now you wanna taste my food, what?
You got your own food, get a attitude
You get left, call the ref if you think it's foul
I ain't trying to hear that, so have a Coke and a smile
Cause after awhile, I'mma wanna get BUCKwild
And now months laters, I'mma say it ain't my child
I'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin
Cause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin
Little Miss Muffett, that's how the ball bounces
Sorry you gotta bounce the ball eight pounds and two ounces
That's how I'm living, just like a rottweiler
When I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder
But then I got milder, and settled down with a harem
And when I can't bear em, I share em
You see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss
I ain't a nerd, but WE'VE GOT BUSH
So cut the bush brat, and let's move it like a U-Haul

Down the street, watching ladies
Nobody's watching you, because you got a baby
I ain't trying to be a stepfather so I don't bother
Word to mommy dearest, I look farther
Down the road, to a road not taken
I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care
A new flower, so Joe can take a shower
And get wet, and then jet
Like ahhhh, seven-forty-seven
I tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven
Then I'm stepping, so when they call me, you'll hear
"Is Common there?" Uh-uh, sorry
You got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack
Chopping down the cherry tree and never coming back
It's like that and it'll be like that
Because a dog is a woman's best friend, black

Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of him
Hard streets and a life that crested him
Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin
He knew the President wadn't addressin him
Though dead presidents was undressin him
Two kids from hot sex no protection and
People don't see how AIDS is affectin 'em
It get hard to get the get the God question in
Can't find a job so you robbin and hustlin
He killed marks and sold dope for cousin 'em
Can't believe they would be the ones bucking him

Relationships with men have been so damagin'
She thought back to when she was at Howard and
Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin' with Alv and them
The ones that make it always ain't the talented
Some dreams get lost never to be found again
At first strippin' seemed so empowering
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein' meat every day is devourin
Cats puttin' paper where she put powder and
Life would break her, now she powdering
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surrounding and, heart was pounding and
She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then
Talked to God, feeling like his child again
Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again

Once the love was strong
Now it’s long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

I’ve been thinking bout, I’ve been thinking bout
I’ve been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose
I know it’s a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice, where did the king go wrong?
Emotions that, that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls, I need your warm
The taste of your mouth, girl, I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born

We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasn’t able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you, my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it’s only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you

Once the love was strong
Now it’s long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you
We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it, I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say, girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together

Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place
It ain't a bunch of niggas all up in your face

It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor
You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker
What you wanna do man?(let go)

Some niggas be on the mic, sounding like dikes
Allow me to get on and bust like Spike(uh)
Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation
Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager
In the age of Aquarius, various things
Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you
Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons
Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms
Every black moon, a rap tune move me
The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played
It don't stop
It's time to get it, get it made
I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face
I know how the underground tastes
I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace
Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers
Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin
Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years
Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now
I can feel the funk

I came through the corridor, with the aura
Raw Chicago mora, scope the horror
Read between the lines and know the border
Some pop wines for juice, I wait in the water
Waitin for you Big Willie niggas to have a show at The Crib
We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is
Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather
The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather
I rap better than you, you, or maybe him
But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb
Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly
Some be so high, they believe they fly like R. Kelly
But then they fall off, dusted niggas is gettin sawed off
They fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off
I kick ass

I can feel the funk1Embed

One day, I was tryin' to be myself
The same day this thug say, "You gotta come hard!"
Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin' hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin'
I guess it's hard for you hard niggas to start thinkin'
Pussy MC's stinkin' so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction and relate it to me?
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggas, be too hard to say "ho" at the shows
I rose like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin' me hard is criminal
Niggas you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin'
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up

Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came

Get you some pussy? you should be gettin' rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin' niggas but readin' be makin' me sleepy (Hey!)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin
Niggas stuck on one and then I ran by
Claimin' they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and you's a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin' about this and about that
Sounding bitch-like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right

Hey give it Boogie like the BX, sex regular booger bitches
Get the backseat, G-bumps'll make you buy tapes
Ex-cape the fire tonight, switch like Jekyll and Hyde
And shit, wreckin we live and shit
This swamp water style'll keep em dirty and wet
I bet mills on the rhyme skills, we walk away set
Rich like topsoil, connect coin with currency
Places that I couldn't pronounce, and then bounce
Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce
Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see It's Yours
Study scrolls that includes the clause
Get your dirty paws out my bowl, your hustle's too old to deal
With the shuffle, you exhaust me like a muffle
Get zapped and zipped in the duffle
Came to the set splashed, no Roley on the wrist
To Hell with a guest list, we all up in this!
A two dollar somethin got your eyes on him
But yo she pinching my ass so we go, limb for limb
Lights studio dim, it's EXACT tonight
So we can drop the Rap Delight, on one!

Of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad
Persona in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge
Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj
I take over breaks and chop loops
Glorifying, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops
Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose
Dating game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Posdnuos
Before you get a style, let's get a style
My style pans the crowd back and forth
You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit
You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough
And didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern
Emcee, familiar sample period; spotting where you sampled
Your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it
I drop science and experiment -- contractually
Came to terms of endearment with my label
Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggas, I contact niggas
Like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows
Wiping your nose like you need blows
Claiming it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats
Or is it how they word it
If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with
Thoughts fermented, I rode rhythms and words tinted
Many lip profess, I'm verb centered

Wonder Why's upon this, just to flex my strength
I was the one who killed wackness so I had to do a bid
Of twelve years on the mic, before parole with Tommy 'Kid'
Infinite landscaper, green paper maker
Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims
Man these people still taking rappin for a joke
The pimp, I rock it one-double-oh percent
Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide
On the mic exposing your polluted bloodtype
Y'all niggas need a visit from the Brain Fairy
Walk around dead, like your physical's buried
Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's
Shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit
That yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless
My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless
Your crew couldn't even measure to mine
That's why yo' bitches is busted, and mines is fine
Performing with an upper design, so back on off the plank
We bringin this Big and Bad like Hank

Flower girls, and make 'em feel like black pearls
Get they minds off acryllic nails and the rap world
It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl
Ma-sons build in lodges, we be in garages
Discussin' who we boned and who God is
Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners

I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail
Tryna make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell
Locked in this Grid like a 2Pac tale
Wild hair and rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought
With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin' thoughts to my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to walk like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle

A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense
The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses
Opportunity and the beat knocks
Women, give me rhythm like beatbox, but it's the year
Of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash'
Who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks
Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike
Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got site/sight
Like a construction worker, when it's time to build
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's time to kill
In perserverence I'mma find a meal, and provoke

Some people got ignorance confused with bein' street
On the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggas in my box throwin suggestions
Had me checkin' myself and double checkin', I popped the resurrection
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips
Writin niggas with stripes, I hold posture with
Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich

Envisioning the hereafter, listening to Steve Wonder
On a quest for love like the "Proceed" drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and chief weed from her
It's a cold world and niggas need summer
At times, my going forward seems like retreat
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and Jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seeming contagious
Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip-hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit I can't honor
It ain't that you selling, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform live-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could've sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key twenty
Young blood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land
I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him
When it rained, it fucked with him
This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming
I said it's hereYou might also like10Embed
This the city of Chicago
The state of confusion
The style I'm using is free
Or probably, it would be if my mind was
Peep, I'm behind 'cause
I didn't handle my functions while in high school
Although I was cool
The hood I live in ain't that proper
'Cause a cop'll stop ya
And have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty
I'm not filthy nor am I rich
Ain't that a bitch
Like life is, not your wife is
See that your better half
Do your math
And peep that two halves make a whole
And all I have to hold is my self pride
So these streets I strive
Like a Black Panther asking can the
Situation get much worst
All I do is try to appeal to the masses
As the phrase "keep it real" passes
The teeth of too many phoney individuals
Snakes, that smooth like criminals
They create chemicals that the Earth hate
Doing they damndest to decrease my birth rate
I'd settle for lesser knowing that I'm worth wait
Or at least my weight in precious gems
So I'm steadily steadly steadly
Trying to lose my religion, like R.E.M
Created in His own image so am I him?
And in the middle of this crisis
Shid(Shit) I wonder where Christ is
Well, he damn sure not in K town or the wild hundreds
Where they broadcast G.D. till the world blow-up
And Stone run it
Hunted by police for display in state vile cages
Come out to make receive minimum wages
Plus, with disease that are contagious
It is fucking outrages
The amounts of Black and Brown they lock up
But the Most High encourages me to put the Glock up
And stock up on do for self knowledge
A brother couldn't afford to go to collage
So I went to learn form the school of hard knocks
On the hard blocks of the Chi
Even I think about moving out to River Oaks
As my liver soaks in mad Hennesy
Cause I got a bad tendency
To do a lot of drinking
But now I do a lot of thinking
Blinking, was your third eye
When you heard I
Was one of the chosen
Industry doors keep closing
Watch the closing doors
Niggas want a record deal
But can they deal with a record?
Cause once they get rich
They tend to switch like a sissy
Please miss me with all that bullshit you popping
This science I'm gonna keep on dropping
And me, I won't be stopping
Even if you had one of them red octagon

Extra salty 'cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snapping, my guy tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggas was over my crib getting smoked out
No telling who had the place scoped out
Dot had brought over some niggas I didn't know
I'm asking who are you, they said I'm here with them all
If it was them, soon I'm a collide with them
And they better not be rocking no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car he would know
Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib?
They had a set of keys, but that I wasn't trying to believe
But I couldn't put it past him or those other bastards
It'd be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
'Cause whoever did ain't gon' admit it
The blunt and dirty disses is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface
Cause telling the law, Joe, is worthless

Driftin' on a memory
Brought forth from a fifth of Hennessy
As in times of '89 they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually, broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes, this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggas be fuckin' girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin' over if he said, "Dumb bitch"
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin' the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin' lot
Unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin' off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

Saved my day, dancin' on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin'
Over gossip, Kenwood broads was pourin'
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
And Starter coats out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD I would quote Stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
Either go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin' like Vice Lords, down to the Taste
Not wantin' to bring my lady around crew 'cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up

Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin' Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late, callin' broads, hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at, then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes, havin' bakeouts

High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin' and
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin' and

Give it a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes (Yeah!)
My album, niggas was expecting, now my water broke
Before it, I was sort of broke
Get the paper for the funnies (What?), sports and the horoscope
Order curry goat like Fluke Stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short of rope
At the end of the road trip still, I'mma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown trying to get home
Barely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga get gone
Fuck the wind storm, my pen told the street folklore (What?)
Body language spoke raw
Don't talk to broads that are spoke for, that provoke war
Stand out like cold sores, claim you hard but you ho-core

I write like Richard for publishing while you sold yours

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I was trying to solve
Can't understand who the fuck was involved
Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane
In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame
My guy came to grab me in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart knelt
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swinging and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggas is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town?
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came in during the day when at work they was found
At the mound I stand vocal pitch high, asking who done it
Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked, about to go Wild Hundreds
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill, and get blunted
And left a roach in the ash tray I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
Overlooked beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kicking what shit was left all around the house
Thinking whoever came in on me is out

I was born in Chicago, raised on Planet Rock, talking zuh zuh zuh zuh
Cats knock my tape like boots, I'm as fresh as fruits
You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke
Repent! You burn up, you got me bent
I'm current as an event, got on big hoes at Freaknik
Frequently you're telling me Whoopty Woo can rock it
So? He ain't put no scratch in my pocket
Yo herb, with my hand I cock it
And rock it like that brother in Colors, 'cause I want y'all to live
My crew is too live, we sneakin' to the rear
But I can't get us all in free (What?)
It's just another case of that 2-dollar emcee
I rock the same clothes 3 days straight
To you they wrinkled but to me they straight
Now I'm straight; are you straight?
I'm straight as long as I got beer
I thought about it, Jack, and now I'm outta here

("Maintain the rock, don't stop the rock") (8X in background)

They be like, "Go 'head, go 'head"
'Cause I got's the cuts like Bobbitt, rappers are dickheads
Shoppin' they demo, I do 'em like Big Red
My office hours are from 9 to 5
While you avoid the party I make it live
The fellas nod and the chicks dance
While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants
I'm as dope as PCP; MC's see me and they start having flashbacks
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back
Nowadays blacks don't know how to act
Besides Larry Fishburne, Charles Dutton, and Wesley Snipes
Marks wanna test me because I test the mics
But I check 'em like sound, and like Goose, I'm down
Plus I done got better since "Soul by the Pound"; I'm maintaining

Rappers I'm fondlin', they try to settle out of court
But I could never be bought

When Rashid got an MC degree

{Here's a little that must be told
(*beat scratches*)
From beginning to end (*beat scratches*)
Here's a little story that must be told (*beat scratches*)
From beginning to end}

I got so much trouble on my mind
So I take time out my day
To pray and I say, now lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep my soul
Peep, I'm gettin' old and this a cold, cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma, it's the same routine
Keep my room clean, I'm lookin' to do some new things
But ain't shit to do
I'm twenty-two, catch
In the prime of my life, I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel, disgruntled
Tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness, I too sing
I may not be the darkest, brother
But I was always told to act my age, not my color
Not knowin' that my color, was out of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes, 'get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight
It's like, how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain?
When it rains, it pours
And it's about to come down hard, thank God
I found you

{Double Trouble: from beginning to end}

As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance from all angles
I tangle for cash
Hopin' it'll last 'til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return *to* the a-rab, then on the way back
I stop- at the liquor store, grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't wanna stop (ahh...)
And I can't turn around, brew- I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up, my liver I burn it up
It's my life I live it up, the cup I gotta give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one-way street
And I done passed *fun* day- three blocks ago
It itself, life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' (how come?)
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself, bein' nobody's Calvin I'm a couch bum
What makes it bad, I had incentive
But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated, or blowed
I'm dealin' with a full deck, at any day I can fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you

It's like a jungle, sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under, I ponder
And try to keep my
Concentration In this idiotic nation
They say become a doctor, but I don't have the patience
Adjacent to that situation
I want an occupation that I'm into
Cause yet have I begin to
Live to my potential, I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience, I reminisce
And wish, I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just' 'sunshine'
But now it's like, I'm gettin' older there's so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest in peace
Of mind, and find who I am
But thank God I found you

No time to get all excited, just write it
From the inside let the pen slide, and spread
The ink on the papyrus, come understand this (what?)
Paint the canvas, givin' you my vision
To mold you, compose you
Get a picture of the scene, then get an exposure
Words out my cipher, the life of my circle
Pain trapped inside of me, Cabrini to Ida B., don't lie to me
You want me in your needle
Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch
I excite your brain til I'm out of your system
Beat digger, not a nigga or a niggaro
I figure you're the winner of the bread
Precede your thoughts 'fore they come into your head
(Yo, kid kinda nice)
From the word, I speak, unique, clear and concise
Heads I'm boring, soaring to a new height of flight
And then fight the night

I say pay attention boy, I say uk look at here
I want you to see me; when you do, you look in fear
I dilate pupils that's cornea than a retina
My Book of Life you felt it, because of the texture
When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me
I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me
Cheap ass niggas, go and purchase it
I ain't do all this work for shit
My style's my child I gave birth to it
Like an immaculate conception, clean I came
Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name
I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys
So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind
I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon' be like
"I can't believe it! I got shot!"
Bowe, so I lick one, not for Riddick
But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MC's that be all over it
Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?
I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall
I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel
I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in
Now them same gumps be askin' me to get them in

Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping
Somewhat like the girl X-rating
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacing
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breaking in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It's certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smoking weed
Thursdays his off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegetarian, she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story she was sticking
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bite
Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating
Are about as slim as he is, though I knew where he lived
In this house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we rolled, I told the guy turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck

And check it out, ha

My raps do laps around tracks and adapt
To any environment.. I'm the comma comma chameleon
I use to pop a wheelie on my blue and gray stingray, it had mags
That was when bitches had Gucci bags
And wasn't rockin' Starters, looking harder than niggas
Hoes wore clothes, that exposed they figures
8-7 stepped in the jam, next the police come
Fights there would be one, numbers I'd get at least one
We'd come to the get-together with whoever
You wouldn't know how deep we was, we all didn't sit together
Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew
And then step to the next cue, let's do it again y'all
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold
The days of Old Chicago and Fun Town
As shorties we run 'round, play strike outs till sun down
But the shit ain't as fun now, and the city's all run down
We'd troop down to Jew Town, talk a cat down on some gear
Have enough for a Polish and car fare
I stare, at what use to be better
And think about who use to cop our liquor
(Who?) Our neighborhood father figure

I got more rhymes than The Manor got folks
Had style since I went to McDowell, wearin' boats
And penny loafers though I had the nickel in mines
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme
It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop
Skeeter would hit from the same spot
'til Marlon tore my shit down, get down
Put your body in motion only the strong survive
But on the 6 or the 5
Live is how the sets used to be, at the Racquet
Ball Club with music by, Andre Hatchett
Or either a beat by Pharris at them country club parties
We'd be hot as hell and House studs would yell "Aight, now money!"
Sauers I would go there, hip-hop clubs were so rare
I liked the music anyways and it was always hoes there
Whitney Young and Kenwood was said to have the best chicks
But mostly Hyde Park and V hoes is who I messed with
The best shit was troopin' to the loop in your precisions
Cut class to get ass, but still go to division (I remember that)
Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work
Bust a spoolie on the spread, but still have some on your shirt
I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh

I tuned into BMX, and taped Farley on the tonemaster
Took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster
Then HPK was the only station that would fuck with rap
You was on The Shore by yourself cats'd (would) say "Up your hat."
What you could you'd make of it, if you was a gump they'd take your shit
Either fight or break for it, we'd go to the lake and get full
My drink then was Boone's and Red Bull
I remember swimming in Avalon, and peeing in the pool
I thought I was cool, with my "Members Only" and a bald fade
Walk to Walgreens to get the Sportin' Waves pomade
And soft brush, as we got older we would stalk, rush, and bang fags
Go to Marshall's and change tags, I snagged 'nuff niggas
In games of Off the Wall, and softball, "Piggy one" I would call
When I first got my three way callin', I caught marks tryin' to lie
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shy
I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh
(Niggas be rollin)
Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I

I express like an interstate
Hyper when I ventilate
My rap pieces penetrate and infiltrate your mental state
Just to reiterate
That I innovate
Bonin' broads when they men-estruate
I spend a great time with the rhyme
More than I did any female
I derailed your train of thought
Because your brain was caught
On some other man's thinking
Now your third eye is blinking
My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath was stinking
I get funky for sure while you're *sniff* unsure
If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw
This track was a broad
I'd be bonin the shit out of it
Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her
Probably some scratch clothes and some J's
I got six million ways to rhyme
Choose one
I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team
I got goals, and I can like a pop machine
I come clean
Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab
Stir my style crazy
Cause that's right, we bad, we bad
Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga
Cause I kick ass
And when I wreck it other rappers be like "whiplash!"

Well I'm as fly as time
I don't believe in role models
But if I do, then I'm mine
I make brothers say "True"
They see you and be like "Fiction"
I want 'spect and dead presidents

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing you could do (Straight up)
There's nothing you could do (You know the boy is serious)
There's nothing you could do
I don't even know why you wanna play with it
There's nothing you could do

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained?
To all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait 'til intermission, run, buy your cameras
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium
The gladiator

I was told by a wise old to come from the heart
Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark
The dark knight to spark mics and start fights
The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice
It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared?
A beast amongst boys, like Paul I'm revered
Vroof, vroof-vroof, vroof-vroof-vroof, well
Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele
You frail on the mic like you might break a nail
I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L
I knew a fat broad that broke the scale
Still touched down cause I was off Martell
Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail
Took the Underground Rail' to the NFL

There's nothing you could do (You've seen what I do)
There's nothing you could do

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained?
To all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait 'til intermission, run, buy your cameras
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium
The gladiator

My words is the sword, my skill is the shield
My life is the style, I stay dressed to kill
A legend like Will, Smith with the steel
I could save the world when shit get for real
The skinny George Foreman, all in your grill
My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel
Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel
The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will
My drive (VROOM!) is how I stay the livest
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid
Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids
You easy to take out cause you hot garbage
I'm amped like wattage—the truth, nigga, honest
Any moment opponents drop out like college
Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust
Stadium, hands in the air, fists balled up
There's nothing you could do (You know what it is)
There's nothing you could do (The boy is raw)
There's nothing you could do (So who next?)
There's nothing you could do

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained?
To all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait 'til intermission, run, buy your cameras
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium
The gladiator

Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt
Scars over bars, symbols of the work
Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama
Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Some of you model bitches is so overrated
Don't mean to underrate it but damn it, I made it
In the water I waded, on the corner I painted
Draw blood like we related
MCs get de-decapitated
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with
Mr. Excitement change your face up like a white chick
Then light shit up like a dread with the herbs
Get sex in the city and head in the burbs
These are the words of a radical
The crowd applaud, I'm bowed, I'm proud
To be the gladiator
There's nothing you could do (How could you even question this?)
There's nothing you could do
There's nothing you could do (Now you know)
There's nothing you could do (The future)

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained?
To all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait 'til intermission, run, buy your cameras
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium

Yeah the sun is shining brighter
'Cause she really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh
Yeah, I think I like her
'Cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh

Seen her on the beach, she was wrapped in a towel
Her body's so endowed, seen her ass, cracked a smile
Enjoying the Nile, taking the breeze in
On some cat and mouse and she was, just cheesing
The sun eased in our conversation
California dreamin' 'bout Californication
Said she had some drinks in the cooler and I had an invitation
If I wanted I could brew up, this is just an indication
Of how cool she was
A couple chicks came up with their groupie love
They ain't want no pictures, only to be hugged
I'm thinkin' DAMN, damn, that's really cool because
Sometimes I wanna chill
Sometimes the best things in life are not in your plans
You came to the sand and got more than a tan
Baby girl, I'm a man and we can do this my way
Take a ride on the highway and pretend like it's Friday and it is

Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh

She was at a barbecue
Pretty painted nails, she took off her shoes
She was 'show and tell' like it was grammar school
Sipping on some ale, I'm thinking, "Man, she cool!"
Sun smiling on her hair
Hey, they playing spades and we can be a pair
She had a spread on her, I can see it from her chair
I love it when it's sunny, girl, you could be my Cher
It's, Independence Day and free is in the air
We danced and danced away, yo
Showed her how to step, it's like a tango
From her body angle, I can tell she like me
She got me a flav, girl you're sweet as Icee
Spicy talk, the sauce drip from my lips
Take tricks and let's dip, we can do something hip
Take a trip around the world in a day, play Fiona A
Let your worries blow away like it's all okay, and it is!
Yeah the sun is shining brighter
'Cause she really make my day
Yeah, you really make my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh

You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a Person In Making Profit
See, I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be travelin'
And Chevy windows be rattlin'
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asking her the name wasn't the way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin' on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried

Motion denied (pause)
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god

(Hey girl, come on over here, check it out)
Make your next move your best move, choose me

How I look working for a nigga in a kufi?
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy

(Yeah, OK)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream
Nigga, you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me (Common: Get real now)
Pimp yo' punk ass, have you write me poetry
I'm from a lane called cash, you too slow for me

You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than baguettes, furs, and slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin' in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
(Common: Try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball?
I know pimpin' ain't easy but damn, you barely surviving
We can't ride together 'cause you ain't driving
(Common: Oh, it's like that)

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
(This, this, this really how I look at it, check it)
You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention

Think I'm gon' risk my ass then give you the cash (Common: Yep)
That shit is the past, I got my own stable (Common: Where at?)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract

Girl, you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right

(Is that right?)
I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Common: Say what?)
Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (Common: And pimp what?)
Pimp systems
Got stores called Big Pimpin' (Common: Where?)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house

(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou
(MC Lyte: Yeah right)
Bring 'em back to the States to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer

(HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Common: Why you laughin'?)
I'm laughin' 'cause you funny
I make bitch niggas like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki

Yo, whatever happened to loyalty?
Don't you want to become royalty?
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher


Well there you have it y'all
The story of pimps and hoes, y'all know how it goes
It's been the oldest profession
The whole thing is like a lesson
Ain't no second guessin'
Pimps y'all, hustlers
All that good shit
Yeah, yeah, 2000 and forever
It'll be here

We take it hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh-er
Yo, yo

My little daughter, started, nursery school
Brother Com, gotta make our move through
The stylist and violence with vibrance
The sign of times with rhyme shit is timeless
The mind is a terrible thing to spill
Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
After travellin the world to see paper's just paper
Streets take ya back and forth like a shaker
I'm a slave to the rhythm's breakin off
I get the job done, but some days I wanna take off
D be like, "We ain't got no time for that!"
?uestlove said, "We ain't got no time for that!"
My old bird like, "We ain't got no time for that!"
So I rhyme when my back hurts
Play the numbers from my grandmother like Kraftwerk
I rock the patchwork fast I'm in to win but then begin to sin
We're in to win with Hen's and Heineken's
Beast for each and greet the meek with speech
To seek and peak cause Pete, shit gets deep
I fuh-fuh-freak, styles that come out
At night, when most cats pull the gun out
Go on and on and, to the break of when the

The simps, please uhh uhh uhh uhh
These studs mention me, uhh uhh uhh uhh
As a, intense MC, sent to be the reign
On the industry I came
With penitentiary talk, Coke and a Hennesey walk
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga
I'm killin 'em soft
Dealin with golf, gettin blowed on the course
I be dissin magazines, but then buy The Source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down - like Bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks
Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
The way you want the game I rub off like henna
I remain like a tattoo with natural raps
Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts
Battle raps is where it began, I'mma end it wherever I land
I done thought of, a master plan, it goes

Mo'fucker move back, I pursue rap at the pace of a New Jack
This miscellaneous numbers and shoes stack
Bruise rap I deliver for the hungry and underprivileged
Something different from these hollering and grunting niggas
This is business strictly, step to my business is risky
'Specially when you as bitch as Missy
Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game
With a four-pounded brainstorm
To make niggas dance in the rain, scared to take a chance in the game
Used to breakdance, it's a shame
What money do to a nigga brain
If he lose his soul what did a nigga gain?

"Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it"
"C O double M O to the N" (cut and scratched 4x)

My train of thought is that of a hustler, or a nigga with his shirt off
Trying to get his work off to customers
I rap with a chip on my shoulder, squeezing Coronas
See shirts that say "We gotta get over"
That jiggy shit is over, the war is on
I only want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture
Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark
For niggas that's flooded with ice, my thought's the ark
Performing warming arts with some shit for the heart
Don't fuck with radio, ignoring the charts
I could give a FUCK what you made in a year, nigga, you wack
A soft nigga on a hard track, in this new rap
Generation I "X" cats like a Muslim
He fell off cause I pushed him
Let his Bently and his weak crew be his cushion
I catch him on the streets, in front of the bodyguards and rush him

You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came
Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane
Then Snoop released and it became a G thang
Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs
Niggas ain't hate you, they ain't paying you no attention
In a circle of faggots, your name is mentioned
With six degrees, I separate MC's, from a business man that's good
From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood
From what a nigga says to what's understood
Keep my shit tight like them boys in "The Wood"
Dick is always hard like the "Boyz in the Hood"
Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi
At the crib some cats give me the cold eye
I'm a bitch slap the next one
Let him know the world is my section for taking
You got to use aggression

And I came down to rock the Earth
My mission condition:

I'm syncing in time in parallel
In binary, no 3rd return
I'm planning intention
With all the redemption

Messenger in the Metropolis; apocalypse here and now
Niggas know the ledge, so they don't come near the style
I appear in clouds on some heaven to earth shit
Fake niggas drown the deeper the verse gets
Deep as a skinny girl's cunt - I surface with the purpose
To let y'all niggas know the demo
Voice is a instrument that's monumental
You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho
Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye
I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggas makin moves
That bob and weave, and niggas with jobs on the side sell weed
I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets
Freaky, like Marv Albert, in outfits, by Chaka Givens
I lecture how I got God but don't got religion
Got a clip for these niggas on the net, sellin my shit
Let's just say you Ramone and I'm Spit
In a habitat of Cadillacs and battle raps
And people that travel at the speed of need
Never agree with the ways of the world
Cats say anything - like they say to they girl
How you bringin it when you sit Indian style?
Niggas know me as Com it's time hear me go wild
With hot shit, yeah
Hot shit, yeah, one two

Old men see visions young men dream dreams
I rock the planet - recognize - I'm the C.R.E.A.M
Com Rules Everything and everything is
How yo' man pullin yo' weight - he ain't carryin his
Scary the biz is like "The Blair Witch Project"
Experiment in rooms on some bare bitch project
State senators, life twirls, most sell out
- like a dread with a white girl
You want me to cypher with you and the Gods?
I just did a show - I'm pursuin these broads
Everyone I ain't tryin to fuck
Wanna feel female presence and conversation a touch
You'll get split like a date that's dusk scuffed and scraped up
Taped up for tryin to say what - ever you was about to say
You rap like a nigga that's about to spray
Get a mouth shot, for openin your mouth to say
Feel my heat in the night - it leaves you without the day
What I write is a passage for niggas to travel through
Before defeatin me - Joe, you better battle you
I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone
Turn the cell off and let my dome roam
Shame I gotta do white labels to keep my life stable
I write fatal bringin niggas to life
A wise man came in the thick of the night
He said BRING THAT SHIT when you pick up the mic
I said, "What shit?"
He said HOT SHIT, hot shit, hot shit

Yo.. I don't know what was on y'all niggas' birds
To go up to the boat - and start robbin' old folks
Now see you done messed with the wrong old lady
You done went wild; yo, check it...

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib - it wasn't involvin him
Four in the mornin, my phone ringin
I'm thinkin, "Who da fuck is this," on the other line screamin
Told em, "Geek down," but they was breathin hard
It was my grandmother tellin me that she had been robbed
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
Freezin but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker
With some friends in a club at the boat gettin bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while (uhh)
Not gamblin but every now and then they'd smile
Then BLAOW! They up mags
And told everybody, "Put your shit in the bag"
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)
Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzin, couldn't describe em
Cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me
With they pants hangin off they ass
Got her some water - and begin to think
How these niggas take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody round the crib know the deal (uhh)
Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real
'Cause yo, it's the big payback..

Later that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up
Them niggas probably knew somethin plus I needed a cut
Walked in they was playin Jigga (jihh-gga..)
Discussin how Da Brat titties done got bigger
These niggas next to me, was talkin bout the heist
Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nut-nin
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticin these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talkin if they did it; it could be they team
A week ago neither one of these niggas had a ring
This hype came in, sellin CD's; said the BD's
Was braggin bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinkin bout my gun if I
See gramps bracelet
I'mma play racist (and what?) and make niggas run
It's the big payback..
{*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs}

My imagination roamed as I got in the chair
Thinkin - when shit went
Down, I wish I was there
Fuckin with fam' - who you are, I don't care
Have your guys pourin liquor witch'ya name in they swear
These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggas who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me runnin in place, it's gettin tricky
(Like who?) Like dude, that do drum'n'bass
There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be
Talkin like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness (what?)
Asked him where he got the new bracelet
He said it was his sister's - I knew then
What made it official, he gave me my change
The money clip had gramp's
Initials (c'mon)
As I, whooped his ass up, six niggas masked up
Pulled up in a Cadillac truck
{*gunfire*}
...we have an arson, three-alarm fire, murder in a possible homicide
The building is entitled "The Ultimate Barbershop"
There are six unidentified bodies in the building
They are all presumed dead
I repeat they are all presumed dead
However there are no suspects
I repeat, the subjects are at large
We might need some backup..
Inform O'Malley that we need backup, over...
The skit definitely needs more siren added to it
Plus a new writer for the script, thank you...
Someone get Prince Paul on the phone please...
Thank you...Embed
Uhh, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk

You know us, this rap shit we bout to own it
You know it, these Mini-Me's trying to clone us
I got a bonus for the bitch that run up on us
I got a bonus for your bitch that wanna bone us
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist

Uhh, no time to sleep 'cause if you sleep you don't eat
Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet
Niggas living on the street while other niggas feast
Aight wit you it ain't aight wit me
Right, gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fucking bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talking bout
Yup, stay turning these bitches out
Dick em down also dick em out
The hoes duck down whenever my dick's out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down South
All the way to London to my nigga Common house, right
It's like a game we never play out, out, out, out

You know us, this rap shit we bout to own it
You know it, cause you can feel it in your throat, say it

I'm bout to let my mind float
(Com, say it)
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game, I assemble dope
Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the fest
Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your bia' feel it in her breasts
Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreamin when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doin this shit like dude in Wild Style
Inviting wack niggas to dinner
I Trick Daddy emcees and I don't know, nann nigga
Who can take it where I take it
You better goin' to God like Ma$e did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move 'em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body
Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want it, need to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy, niggas tryin to clone us
You know us, Thelonious, super microphone
You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real

Everyday (ey day), it's like a ritual
You been invited let the mortal body stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for, you aching for the best
Hurtin like a sore in that ass, like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, cause it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Dropping the line in your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your heart, never go astray
Word is bond
Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucka nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Owning this rap shit, super microphonist and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw duke, more juice than Sunkist
You want this, see when J get to saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, Off The Wall with mines
I’m grabbin my balls when I rhyme now
Nines bust and plus ball all the time, now
Stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinking bout paychecks
Niggas large like an 8X Avirex jacket
Conant Gardens they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce in foreign rides and yours Fords
You funny duke, cause really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas, if you testin us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a payback4Embed
Hey, hey old bean
And you to baby sweetness
Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio
And I didn't have to break in this time
I'm back as a special guest by special request
And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to rassle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family
From around the globe
He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999
And kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies
To love, to be able to give love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime
And to my children running around here
Talking about how nice is they ice
That they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
That was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture; beat that neighborhood
Which you claim you love so dear
Are you mankind or kind of a man?
See, Pops is straight out of the garden
From when the world was starting brand new
Hip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the Underground Railroad
In it's purest form
Yeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad
If the message is not for you
It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze
So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high
I'm flying high with Cee-Lo
Or maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow
Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree without The Roots
And Black Star said we are what we are
The Knowledge Of Self Determination
And my little homie KG
Up there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes
Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind
So if your heart is real
You might hear Big Will, and Mrs. Lauryn Hill
If your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism
And you can't go right until you go left
And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff
Children, I've traveled this globe
North to south, east to west
And whenever my soul appears lost
I follow the musical sounds of A Tribe Called Quest
Okay, we ready to get out of here
We ready to take it home now
Just so everybody knows
When Pops get ready to say something good
I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood
And it ain't no time for no shecky shecky
That's when I call on a Black Girl Named Becky
Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't exist
I just come to give love and peace and honor to all my childrenYou might also like2Embed

Yes, let this music travel through you
Talk about feelings, yeah yo

It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been, time travelin *echoes*
Time travelin *echoes*

Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
Though my sex drive is like a car chase
More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on
My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown
Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my guy caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down
Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross
Many paid dues, but few knew the costs
I ran through the Moss like Randy
Touching down with God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this

Time travelin, took my time in hand

Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man
Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel
I'm dealin wit, wakes, marriages
ATM's, Ericsson's
Loud niggas that whisper carelessness
If we livin in Revelation
Why should the people of the sun have to run?
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason
He said, "Rah, give back what you receivin"
In a race against time, I was caught
In the same game as you, but long live the sport
It's time travelin
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been
Time travelin *fades out* time travelin....

Know I love my baby; my baby loves me
Day gets so hectic, need a little company
It's quarter to eleven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto...

Searching for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third eye on the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and to rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we're not together
Baby, it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Henrock and the Holy Spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall
Of a nation, even when the buildings tumble, I still stand tall
I walk through the valley with a life preserver
Feeling at times, that I might just murder
Yo, but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock or any broad
He found Geto Heaven in himself and God

Love, your happiness don't begin with a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man?
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You'll never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
'Cause one man fucked up, men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At that destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, anybody seems warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop at a store
For you to grow, he had to go, so what you stopping him for?
Not even I could ignore being alone is hard
Find heaven in yourself and God
You know I love my baby; my baby loves me
My day, it gets so hectic, need a little company, yeah
It's 3-1-7, it's time to get some Geto Heaven
(Time to get some Geto Heaven)
Geto Heaven (Geto Heaven) it's time to get some Geto Heaven
Time to get some Geto Heaven, oh...

This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, joe, it's like a trigger to me
Dealing with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doing something you like to support daughters
Keeping your guys from collecting court orders
Conveying messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the in thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I opened it and used it hoping you could grow to it
Whether servant or a surgeon, you gon' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps towards hotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, yeah, yeah
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby

May I ask in what way your life is contributing to society as you sit here day after day after day in this dark room, stringing along on that stupid guitar? Have you ever thought about that? What are you doing for the world or for other people? Day after day, hour after hour, night after night
Logic

Me and my homies just chillin' feelin' the vibes
This the time of our lives but many don't realize
Havin' visions of livin' on another level, never signed to the Devil
The rebel that be fuckin' 'round with the treble
Bumping Tribe in the system like penicillin, motherfucker
I'm killing, spittin' venomous never remember this it's like a system
Say it then I do it, I never missed 'em
Fuck 'em after I kissed 'em, sit back and listen
My chain, it glisten, it's like I'm from another dimension
Did I mention my circle's smaller than an intervention
Then some beautiful women tell me I'm handsome
Then I snatch they heart and make the pussy the ransom
I fuck 'em until inside they belly burst
Stop it, drop the beat and then we cue the verse
Spitting lyrics like how a Mac-11 really disperse
Slaughter MCs and resurrect them when they in the hearse
They say I got too many styles, bitch I've been diverse
They scared to jump in the cipher, I be all up in it first
My apologies but if you're after me then it gets worse
When I come through I spit voodoo and leave 'em cursed
Common logic

This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words, the tribe that's next

It's been a long time and I ain't even in my prime
I remember many moons ago spitting the realest lines
On the come up, matter fact it was long before that
Before I bought my first mic, before I could afford that
This is a letter to the underground, the place where I'm from
This is a letter to the fans that understand what I've done
And even though I gotta leave, man, don't none of y'all grieve
'Cause even in the mainstream that lyricism I breathe
Some of y'all love my raw records, some of y'all don't
Some of y'all will love my radio shit, some of y'all won't
Just like my race, my music has always been yin and yang
Something for everybody, no not just one lane
And on the real, I'll never forget the day I got my deal
Full creative control and the money was unreal
Started from the bottom and got here 'cause of my skill
And I never set a goal that I didn't plan to fulfil
This is the realest, only unto the real shall I reveal this
I even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
From Nasty Nas, Big L to Tribe Called Quest
We the RattPack, in other words the tribe that's next

In-inhale, in-inhale
In-inhale, in-inhale

I breathe deep like an old man in a deep sleep
Or Indian peace pipe in a tepee
The beginning, the end; the first, the last
Breath into eternity the verse will last
Got a chick in the south that be cursing fast
When it was a drought, I knew the thirst would last
Hunger of a homeless, microphoners
Played the game and got a bonus, man cause the plan is
To master like Tiger, so much drive
I am the definition of a rider
Daughter's name means 'survivor', from a tribe of
Colliders, just one word can't describe her
A scribe of the streets, and a good life that we all want to reach
I'm hotter than a beach
Flow is so deep, even underwater
I can inhale to put the world in order

Still raps that are rare, I write with Christ
Passion to stair-way to Heaven is to stay in step
Breath is deep like my man Johnny Depp
You never know the next one God could have kept
So I find it hard to accept
I came from a gang, now I'm a star with a rep
Just to get-- by, 'cause I was slept on like a red-eye
Like Rastafara, I knew to keep my head high
Blessed by the father, son of the author of life
So rap became my wife
Like love at first sight or a thug in his first fight
It's all new, so you got to feel your way through
Until you break through, it might take two
Inhale deep to inflict too, it's great to
Breathe

I'm the river that flow through the hood
Through the woods, through the 'burbs
Through the mud, through the bricks
Over the curb, to the forest reserve
Got with four acres and a forest of words
Plant and grown them, for the young seeds to know them
Trees is blowing, we see change in the wind
It's a new day and I got to take it in
See a black man run, we need him to win
Young eyes search, search for a better tomorrow
That belief lead the way and the angels follow
Open doors for the hopeful to go through
Cause I was chose to and I'm supposed to

I know that change gon' come
The race begun
We're almost there, oh yeah
I know that change gon' come
The race begun
We're almost there, oh yeah

I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child
Always smiled, let my mind float like a child
Wishing I was smart as these kids are now
All grown up still wishing I'm child, again
Church song reminded me to stay grateful
Omoye reminded me to stay playful
Days go by, my life on high
I lead on my wall so the fight don't die
In me, I found purpose why I emcee
Inspire a young world to be greater than me
I fall awake and I dream a song
So the little shorties will sing along

I just dropped by the studio, see what my son does
My main man, my son, Common Sense
They used to call me No Sense
Now they say I got plenty sense—about 6,000 years of it
You know, I’m just checking him out
See what’s going on, cause I’m always sitting around telling him about
What we used to do back in our hood, you know
We used to be down and run this town
And it was all at PC Pub
You know, and I’m shaking
And they working on it, and they bringing it back
I see harmony, understanding
And they working on that love thing too
Cause they be down with it, you know?
Now I hear them saying things like, whoa whoa, I get a good feeling
I be saying “keep it up
Keep on moving with your groove, you’re going the right way"
Cause it’s got to be in your heart
And I can tell by your beat, you got it
See there, I can do a little piece, put them together there
Yeah, we used to be running this whole town, here
We used to be basketball playing brothers, you know
Now everybody’s playing basketball
I wonder where they come from? What they claiming?
Gonna make an old man get his shoes out
And throw one down to slam dunk on them
Every time the leaves start turning brown getting through the fall of the year
I can say yea it’s time to play some
What these youngsters talking about, they running out of breath?
What you say?
Well I tell what, we’re gonna try something brand new here
Cause everybody like new things
We’re gonna work on something new, and I’m gonna call it ‘peace’
We’re gonna pretend like its 6 years old
And we gonna build it and mould it
And nurture it and culture it
And grow right into our society for all of us to have
Do you believe in the peace?
Not that piece, but do you believe in the peace?
Alright, I see you raising your hand - you believe in the peace
OK, bring it
See if I can’t talk common sense into them
Let’s cruise on down to 47 St. where dad used to hang out at, you know?
Eh remember in a few years when we moved from 47 to 87
47 was my hood, 87 was his

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end, yo

It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hoping it'd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide, some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand

With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always, yeah

Love is not a mystery, it's everything

She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill, uh, like OK Go
Had a body, A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, tryin hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
Readin Us and People mag, tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers, then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady

He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks, in his ears he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types, da D-D-Dame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati sport, reading the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected

Relationships can be dead but look live to us

Losin yourself and you're lyin' and stuff

Everyone hides their faces
Behind a mask they wear
Jimi was a rock star
Searching for that magic place
That he could touch in the sky
Just to get his people high

Life is so colorful
Reds, blues and dreams
Jimi lives in a purple haze
In a psychedelic maze
Playing the streets like an instrument
Pulling strings wherever he went
Angel sent from the sky
Just to get his people high

Women all around
Fast cars and sound
And freedom he was bound
Couldn't see the ground
Jimi, come out why don't you set me free? (set me free)

So high, born to fly
Getting high off his own supply
With the most highs of the sky
Everybody follows the same lord
Choosing his light to guide the way
You do, but who do you choose?
Some try things but few die so young
Something among Jimi was stung
Everyone hides their faces

Here we go, here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war!) and the battle with us
I know that Black Lives Matter, and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods; I don't believe the news
Or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again

The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
The guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for, now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans
You know, you know, you know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is to let a person feel like somebody. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from…

When niggas I ain't like is showin' love to me
Good food and the mood and the hood is free
Peace and free is the frequency
This is the day women took over
No longer over your shoulder do we have to look over
Imagine, war is now over
Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers
On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa
The mayor of the Chi is Liz Dozier
Hoods feel safer, families feel closer
We all drunk in love with no need to be sober
Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice
You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest
Prices, chivalry is no longer lifeless
We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again
Things are merry and there's more marryin'
Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian
For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows
Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes
It's more love songs on the radio
Respect for the ladies, you can hear it in the flow

How should I begin?
This is the story of a boy named Lonnie Lynn
As I say it, the spirits enwhip me
He was raised in the belly of the city
Chicago, discovered by du Sable
A Black Frenchman that I had to mention
Extensions of a young man raised on a low end
47th and Michigan, lackin' a little discipline
Know Grandma Mable did the best she could
You know how young niggas want a testy hood
There he stood, taller than most black boys
One of the best ballers out of Illinois
College in Ohio, this is like his bio
Talks that we had, man, they was never idle
He talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible
He talked how he smoked dope and sold it for survival
He talked about the ancestors, in our lives; they're vital
He said y'all niggas love the bang 'cause you tribal
Spiral of life, Chicago to Denver
Anywhere he went, of attention, he's the center
6'9", big heart, big mind
He he spent a lifetime tryin' to be big time
He did in a way, he made to the ABA
And the things he say on my record
When I was a shawty, he bought me "The Message"
It was his messages in the life I would step with
Didn't see him much, spirits are connected
The Father creates it, the son can reflect it
His perspective: sometimes seemed crazy
His perspective: sometimes seemed brilliant
His perspective: somehow it shaped me
His perspective: undoubted I feel it
He'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him
I said, "Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em"
The fight that he had with cancer was a brave one
Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication
Breathing heavy, he talked reparations
He said, "Son, we live through our generations"
Offspring, coughing, Gene Ammons playing
In the background, he was talking, I was praying
Our Father, take care of my father
As far as he went, may I go farther
May our dreams and legacies live through our children
Though I can't touch him, I can still feel him

I gotta be honest it's so much different without you here
But I have no fear
I'll see you when I get there
To that city bright and fair
You were all I needed you to be
And now I thank you for all you gave for me
So Father, I stretch my hands to Thee
No other help I know
If you withdraw yourself from me
Somebody tell me where, oh where shall I go?
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee

Southern leaves, southern trees we hung from
Barren souls, heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating, fathers from children
Institution ain't just a building
But a method, of having black and brown bodies fill them
We ain't seen as human beings with feelings
Will the U.S. ever be us? Lord willing!
For now we know, the new Jim Crow
They stop, search and arrest our souls
Police and policies patrol philosophies of control
A cruel hand taking hold
We let go to free them so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

Instead of 'nigga' they use the word 'criminal'
Sweet land of liberty, incarcerated country
Shot me with your ray-gun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business, America's the company
Investing in injustice, fear and long suffering
We staring in the face of hate again
The same hate they say will make America great again
No consolation prize for the dehumanized

A man whose genius and freedoms and—
Ability to communicate and—
To talk, and to touch chords—
A man who has the ability and the audacity
And the unmitigated gall God to stand up, to stand up

I heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice on the throne
Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home
I was told to write a song for the people
Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence
Tell them to invest in us and make testaments about each other
On how we sisters and brothers
Cover the land and corners with poems and stone
Go hard with it, let 'em know you God with it
Even though I authored it, let no one margin it
And make it all about paper or first week's sales
Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell
Those that fell off the path, bring 'em back to the math
Your staff will be your microphone
Your name is Common, you was born to fight the norm
Take house niggas outta darkness 'til they lights is on
I'ma put a hyphen on your name: rapper-actor-activist
You the one that can reach into the black abyss
Stars that's asterisks, show 'em what a classic is
Freedom riders need passengers
In your lyrics use scriptures and passages
To make them rise like Lazarus and resurrect it again
They'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again
Every section you in, bless 'em and keep bussin'
If they don't like it, shake the dust and say "fuck em"
Until you get home, I'm the one you trust in

Going home to live with God

Go into the wilderness like Musa on a pilgrimage
Streets are villages, speak with diligence and authority
The fake are the Pharisees and Sadducees
Give them that Garvey free from the Black Odyssey
Yo pardon me, you the God bodily
Functioning on earth as a part of me, that's why I gave you artistry
Go into the hoods with the shooters and the strippers
Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us
Tell sisters they earths and goddesses
If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless
Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near
You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear
You'll appear in the circles in Hollywood, I birth you
In Chicago, you know how to parlay good
You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys, give those to your family
Don't get caught up in the vanity or the world's insanity
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live, going home to live
Going home to live with God

Fellowship, joy and peace

All praise to the all-eye seeing supreme-being
Giver of joy and peace, love supreme freedom
See him in your son, see him in the daughters
The mountains, the waters, all divine order
The king unseen, one dream that I had, I was talking to my dad
He said, "Things ain't as bad as they seem"
Is this a God dream the way 'Ye sing it?
The dream seemed to go on as the day lingered
The meaning of life, you can't frame or name it
True stars remain like the name of David
Niggas get foreign cars and think they made it
It ain't yours 'til you create it

Red wine time on the couch
Happy you agreed to hang out
Keep my head in the clouds
Keep them old names out your mouth
I can make you laugh out loud
We the only ones in the house
I can help you body wind down
Make this bottle disappear right now
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Let's stay in for the night
Maybe take a walk outside
Let's distance your pride
Me fall in love with your mind
If I look deep in your eyes
I can guess your zodiac sign
We ain't got nothing but time
We can just chill and unwind
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable

Freedom is the road less traveled by the multitude
The mood, it's the mode, it's the culture
Where there's food there's vultures
More Tony now, back then I was Sosa
I was sent like a penny in a loafer
The 2Pac Deepak Chopra
On a plane drinking wine with Oprah
When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her
Black Caesar, ey o amo roma
Tuto biene vino rosa
My dominican girl she loves soca
Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA
Most of my friends at home that I'm close to
When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture
Used to be a hooper, now I'm a hoper
Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound
I'm bound to the underground
Breaking walls down for the black and brown
A activist is active now
How far will you go for exposure?
Little homie in the paint tryna post up
Don't make me have to put you on a poster
Posterized by what I vocalize
Weathered the storm like I know the skies
Yea we wear the mask but I know no disguise
These signs of the times are notarized
Written by the lord of the skies mortalized
In us, I got cold through cruel winters

Never been good with pretenders

Off the deep end
Heightened senses
No pretending
Make my head spin

In my bedroom

Put that tape on
Tell me what you want
Let's just make time feel, long

A nigga told me only rhyme for 19-year-olds
Nigga, you should rhyme wherever the spirit goes
Here it goes, lyrical miracles
These are pyramids from the imperial
In theory though, low end scenario
And sound boy burial drove me to classic material
Aerial nights blew my mind out of stereotypes
For ethereal heights, I write like Richard
Invisible man, pictured below
With the hieroglyphicable prolifical flow
On the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go
Supreme wisdom in my system is the kick in the door
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin' though
This is a ritual for those depicted as low
Now I passed life like I've been here before
The reincarnation of It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold
Us Back, coldest raps, for me, the globe is like a culdesac
Around the world in a day, find forever and I stay
I'm from the weather where they spray, there's gotta be a better way
People dying every day, wonder what would heaven say
Devils need to get away
From Chevrolet to Escalade, from evergreen to the everglades
I kneel where the rebels prayed
Seen 50 grey, but they need better shades
Niggas rhymin' like their whole style in retrograde, the escapade I'm on
Is like when the sun, moon and stars was born
It's hard to explain how these pyramids formed

My bio is feedback from what we need rap
On some Marshawn Lynch, let me run it back
And come with that new black spiritual
Every rap's a miracle, condition now critical
Can't lack lyrical, we need black generals
Holy war, tap into you like Savion
But I'm a orator, the corduroy boy
Came the door-to-door name down the corridor of fame
I walk like an Egyptian on a mission to listen to conditions
Envision a vision of what we wishing
I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind
Spit the wisdom of the one divine
Close encounter of the wonder kind, front a line
Shift the paradigm with a pair of rhymes

The wind against my face, tells me that I must go
Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me
When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA
So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain

The last note I sang was in Beaver Falls, PA
At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name
But I knew I couldn't work there, 'cause to follow my dreams
They tell me find that place, find that place

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

Deep in my destination, trying to find my destination
With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today
Constantly it's on my mind
I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration
Oh, I've got to cross this nation

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

Took my hustle and made it a weapon

Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for?
If so? Then what am I stressing for?
We tight, then why can't I let it go?
Everything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor
Let it rain cause it's ancestral
Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you
Let it rain and come down visceral
For those no longer here in the physical
Let it rain cause it's like tears from you
Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do
Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful
So that it can service you and return to you
Let it rain, let the rain surround me
And never drown me, I was lost when it found me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me

Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle
The masked struggle that I'm in, the same one that you in
I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Had to take it a step further the way that Ralph tried
Oh that's my stepfather
He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors
For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me
Black is the color of my true love spirit and I do love lyrics
And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club
Still I love

With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together
What I'ma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love

When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside

Stay extended
The lap of love we lay up in it
Days is vivid same incentive
The way we hit it's like Will and Jada did it
A house is not a home unless we staying in it
Stay committed
I used to get around now I'm staying centered
Angels ascended, grounded, stay cemented
The mentality, we all casualties
I can't do this casually actually you challenge me
To balance me
Paid dues and salaries
Been through truths and fallacies
The unfamiliarity made me loose calories

Breaking rules, breaking laws, breaking through
Breaking walls, sacred thoughts
Are the oceans that we make it cross
The truth is a naked cloth
No need to take it off, the wait is off
Love we make and do is unbreakable, relatable
State in you relating to the faith in you
Awaken to what faith can do
Fate is inescapable, super friends, we capable

I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually, if it was meant to be, then it would be
‘Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, joe, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy, I tell you, I miss her

Now, periodically, I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos, and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me, by not preachin' to me
But speakin' to me, in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
'Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said, "Afrocentricity was of the past"
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
Now, black music is black music, and it's all good
I wasn't salty, she was with the Boyz n the Hood
'Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once The Man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' about poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it, but I'm committed
(Girl, he's committed) But so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same, lettin' all these goofies do her
I see niggas slammin' her, and takin' her to the sewer
But I'mma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop

But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin' Derick, "Tell Cara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say "You ripped, wow", yeah, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin' a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour, so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say, tell 'em, J

Ah, the sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin' "Damn, 'Ye snapped with this beat!"
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels
Haters back down, gotta be that steel
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal
Look how they did D'Angelo, ask him "How do it feel?"
My best friends worry bout me
'Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin' I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacay where it ain't no channels
But it's quite okay for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin' with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon' check myself in, again
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie (Uh, ha!)
We comin' back for them
They might say, but they don't know

They say "Dude think he righteous"
I write just to free minds, from Stony to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis
They say "life is a game," so I play hard
Writin' for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job
They say "Sef kept the hood together"
I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever"
Play my cards right, they say I went too left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"
Seen the corner, now they say "That nigga's back," uh
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie

Have you ever met a woman that just took your breath?
(yeah uh huh uh uh, yeah uh huh)
So deep inside her life, she contemplated death
(damn she deep, give a fella the creeps)
Can't help but get attached to a woman like that
(true that, true that, true that, true that)
The contact was quite immediate, I had good tact
(Because you the man, yo, you know you the man)
We related and debated over food and tunes
(*people talking* "No I'm Good)
Started out in September, now we entering June
(say word, say word, say word)
Simple night in the crib, no, it just won't do
(No, it just won't do, no, it just won't do)
Know why? Because she liable to start shit too wild for you
(wild for you, wild for...)
She wanna push my whip, buy diamond chips
And take on trips, conversin my flip
Gotta do her hair, take her out to the fair
Win a teddy bear, make sure you don't stare
At another one comin, don't be startin nuthin
Be a slave to her, don't be brave to her
Make sure that she's right, make sure that you're wrong
When she wants it, do it, make sure that it's long
If anyone wanna make it work it's me
(Phife Dawg, help me out, Phife Dawg, help me out)
But we gotta come to a common ground baby
(What you say, pop? What you say, pop? Help me out)
Any man, he can claim to be the one for you

Yeah, yeah, me and my man Com' Sense
Rallyin' troops like Joseph Stalin
Where you at, yo?

I'm 'bout to make the name Common Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And I'ma make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"

Yo, yo
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect the rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him

I'm creatin' the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Puttin' together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testin' me
Because you know you can't "F" with me
Steppin' to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposin' yourself to the verbal radiations
Sayin' you can defeat me is nothin' but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be diggin' my styles like fossils of pterodactyls
Who wanna battle?! I'm bad to the bone marrow
The earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MC's who compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch!
What?!

"Steppin' to me is like goin' to the county bein' a neutron"

I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunkin' like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles! Rhymin' big words and not sayin' shit
The clique that you came in with, accents you flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced
Than a rapper whose career you could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble, it's mistaken as a weakness
When poetry's in motion, like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard-workin' teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my livin' off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions
"Fuckin' with Canibus"
"Fuckin' with Canibus"
"Fuckin' with Canibus"
"Fuckin' with Canibus"
"Yo, sick with it"

Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Comin' to damage you, spittin' understandable slang at you
I be the all-seein' lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred-sixty degree visual
When the signal is given, MC's get bitten
With venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wicked as Satan worshipers goin' to Catholic church services
You heard of this new lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snaps, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear, black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into 'The Artist Formerly Known As'
You gay-ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, takin' pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now, I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source, chillin' on page forty
Put this in your CD-ROM: www-dot-Canibus-dot-com
You can find me on the internet talkin' to chicks
That was sweatin' me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talkin' mad trash, tryin' to get 'em to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
A Beast from the East Pt. II comin' to see you!
It's time I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Now, that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
"Catch another sucker duck MC out there"
Since I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe

He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black...maybe

Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from... from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged..you get laughed at... you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us... black maybe
Black maybe...

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside

Raised by game where niggas ain't phased by fame
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain
Stay in your lane, Brokeback ain't the way of the game
My brainstorm is like I stay in the rain
My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game
You was hot but can't stay in the flame
Ghetto pain and windows crack, the fist is like a symbol for black
Can tell the real by how the real interact
In the middle of whack my soul sticks to a track
Kickback records get kicked to the back
I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his
Child in a good school and know what her gift is
It's global warming, the world is shifting
Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bitchin-ass rich kids
Who don't know in life you gotta go the distance

Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
Opposing the fascist, make cuts and got gashes
Scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers
Whose careers now ashes it's too many slashes
In his name, came in the game these gun-clappers
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen 'em dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run while I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlas
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game

From the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure
Selling weed out of cleaners
From rocks to barber shops and beemers
Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena
The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
GOOD bring business to the hood like Harolds
Five year olds walking by them self in the street
The young die of cancer, I stop eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th St. like peace
Even though it's war to G, got 'em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and they complacent with beats

Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise, I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones

Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back, or too far in front of me
The present is a gift, and I just wanna be (Be, be, be, be)

Com should have been at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill
But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals
Now Com could get the penny, but I want my own company

In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle
Yeah. yo, check it-

There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, trying to hold on
To life; she thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room; she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin, it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
"Who shot the trooper?" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, y'all

Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul

It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see them when they're taking her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, paint, and begin to read
Two years in a hole, her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hoping she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
'Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, people
I'm thinking of Assata, yes
Listen to my love, Assata, yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul

Yo, from North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't've done
Medical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba

I’m thinking of Assata, yeah
Listen to my love, Assata, yeah
We’re molded from the same mud, Assata
We share the same blood, Assata, yeah
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Freedom? You're asking me about freedom? You're asking me about freedom? I'll be honest with you. I know a whole lot more about what freedom isn't than about what it is, because I've never been free. I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is
The way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to
Blossom. Freedom is-- is the right to be yourself, to be who you are, to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do--11Embed

For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique
I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle
Psss, I'm only buggin
While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose
And picked a rhyme, any rhyme I don't have any time

Here it comes I'm as Able as Cain to get raw
That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dicks
This is not da bomb so save all your threats
I'm good to go and also I'm Rets
Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks
Down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with fros
Hoes with weaves, the bald-headed to the dreaded
To folks with butters, high rollers in rollers
Players with plats, studs with stocking caps
I be rockin' raps 'til I collapse
Niggas play my tape about as much as they do craps
I'm on point, I cee-lo, I see high
Hi C, I'm free at last
I'm a free man, free as World B
And like an early bird, I'm special
You ain't that special, as Ed and Vesta

The revolution will not be televised
The revolution is here
Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo

The perseverance of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes on ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that

"This is rap for real, something you feel"
And you know, yes you know
"This is rap for the Black people"
Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy
"This is rap- This is rap for real"
And you know, yes you know
"This is rap for the Black people"

In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit

And you know, yes you know

Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, sat by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she make brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all bop to it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like

And you know, yes you know
"Thi- This is rap for real, something you feel"
And you know, yes you know

Two DJs, one microphone
We freestyle, we write at home
It don't, it don't, uh-uh, we go on
You the one I can't leave alone
You grown? I know you groan
When I'm in you, I feel home
We in the house of love, no lie
Appreciate you more as time goes by
When it's truly true, it don't die
I see you in L.A., I see you in N.Y
I see you in the A, I see you in the Chi
I hear you when JAY still make the song cry
Truthfully, I wanna rhyme like common sense
You the one that gave me that confidence
You the one that told me 'bout consciousness
And said see beyond my metropolis
You put the booga-booga loop, pop lockin' this

Now I know you had to grow too
And experience life so you can know you
We all change, for what it's worth
You an angel and still down to earth
In many ways you like my religion
When no one else did, to me you listen
Gangstas, gods, you hugged and kiss 'em
No matter, you stayed in my system
Your eyes glisten, you talk vision of partyin'
And gettin' people out of prison
Through the struggle you taught us to Nipsey Hussle

You recognize little uzi ain't here to shoot ya
At 21, you knew I was savage
But you said, "Common, you will never be average"
It's a cold world, we need JAY
If you could dot com, you could dot K
You rock two chains, keep your mind free
You see a Malcolm X in a YG
You told me I'm the mane like Gucci
With a chance to rap and make movies
You gave mills to the meek, to inherit the Earth
Before me too, you said, "Ladies first"
Things get rocky, you there ASAP
Rocky or Ferg, you there to swerve
I want you to get the love you deserve
My will made it on a mic' with words
With no name, I was a hard MC
Love and hip-hop, on some Cardi B
Now you a part of me, creatin' Tyler style
A future ain't odd to see
Free spirit, with young will like Jaden
When I see you, you never agin'
Made in America, for the world to see
You everybody's but you my girl to me

When we wash all our pain away
We say, "Oh, my Lord"
When we can't make it through the day
We pray, oh, my Lord
It's a test coming to my faith
We pray, oh, my Lord, mmh
Will my people ever be safe?
In the land that takes us and breaks us, I can't be sure

Walking with the Lord, I see footprints
My mama always told me use my good sense
Common always looking for the good sense
Since we all got good in our essence
In the hood sense, we all good anyway
That's why you always hear another dollar, 'nother day
I see the day as a new beginning
Movement of the people, movement of the women
To get the Earth spinning in the right direct
This movie of life, sometimes might project
Acts, scenes that don't seem serene
I light palo santo, put on Love Supreme
And get into the being of the great I am
That's when I get to seeing just how great I am
Many many times from mistakes, I ran
But I'm just a cake, let me bake, goddamn
I pray I don't forsake my man
And whenever I fall, on faith, I land
Imperfections, resurrections
In the mirror staring at God's reflection
Reflecting on my aggressions
On my progressions, on my obsessions
There's a lesson in not feeling less
And in seeing life itself as a blessing

In the struggle of us, there's a unity
The moral universe stay schooling me
Will the king of kings really rule in me?
I'm an instrument, stay in tune with me
This orchestrated by Karriem, Samora, Boom, and me
If agape had a Cupid, she'd be shooting me
This rap here is fear's eulogy
Escape rooms with glasses of wine
Just another crutch for my brokenness
A term that I got from my therapist
As a black man, I feel I should be sharin' this
In the hood they say we crazy and we derelicts
But we needed for our kids and our marriages
The old folks say we don't do that
But taking care of self is the new black
Unconventional ways, unconditional ways
Mediation, mindfulness, it's just given to praise
I'm in a phase, all I see is victory
You on that wave, then come and get with me
I only want what's meant for me
And say the things that's sent to me
In penitentiaries, I met the most enlightened
Finding the losses, Heaven's excitement
I write with a force of a kid that wanted to
Be in The Source, but that changed, of course
I maintained the sauce and became a boss

They dated three years before they got married
Lived next door to my homeboy Merry
Right in South Shore where the bodies get buried
Her family Jamaican, she nice with the curry
Like Steph, she step back and splash spices
Kit Kats and cakes was her vices
Vanilla icing with the strawberry
She was lactose so she rarely ate dairy
Her husband named Terry, knew where to get the good cake
Vegan, black-owned for the hood's sake
Today was one of them days, she couldn’t wait
And she got off work a lil' late
Shortcake, after a long day, the smell of perfume in the hallway
Terry open the door like, "What up, bae?"
Nigga actin' like it’s just another day
She dropped her bags, quickly kissed him
She was on a mission, went straight to the kitchen
Looked at the cake and noticed it was different
Thinkin' to herself, "Why this nigga get this one?"
Opened the box there was two pieces missin'
Is it just suspicion or a woman's intuition?
Terry moved positions to give her a hug
Right then, she noticed lipstick on the mug

The nerve of this nigga
She gon' have to swerve on this nigga
Put the clothes on the curb of this nigga
He even changed the shirt, 'cause this nigga
Must be into something
Whole house clean, could tell he was frontin'
She went to the back, the trash, he had dumped 'em
The bedroom, the bathroom, trash, he had dumped 'em
Usually 'round the crib he don't ever do nothin'
Huntin' and sniffin' around for what's relevant
Might get to sniffin' his nuts like a elephant
Some niggas is anti-intelligent
That bullshit, he kept on selling it
Like a traphouse
His story was the neighbor got locked out and had to come over
Birth of a salesman, he almost sold her
'Til she saw strands of blue hair on the shoulder
Sittin', cussin' on the couch at her spot
Saw "Love & Hip Hop" was recently watched
Something that he wouldn't watch
She thinkin', "Terry, you shoulda kept ya dick in a box"
Damn, this muhfuh-

Terry thinkin' he gon' put her on that counter
She like quiet, he gon' make her get louder
She found a knife for the cake to start cuttin'
Terry said "Stop", all of a sudden
"Baby, I must've been on one
This got dairy in it, I got the wrong one"
The phone rung, it was the bakery he got the cake from
To make her feel good, he put it on speaker
So she wouldn't be insecure like Issa
The clerk said, "Mr. Terry, yo, you left your VISA
And it was really real good to meet your wife
Her blue hair was fresh, her perfume was nice"
Things got ice, ice
He about to feel that spice, spice
She remember goin' up flights smellin' perfume
And seein' blue hair in the bathroom
As Terry mumbled, tellin' his story
She pushed him out the window of the fifth story

When the day breaks, I display grace
Through infinite takes, and heartbreaks
The ground shakes, talks around race
Through birth quakes, I keep my crown straight
And bow face to you, it's salutations
I hold you high, you brought me in creation
You were patient with me dribblin' in the basement
And said, "Where's your common sense, boo? Don't waste it"
The pain that you had, it was hard to place it
For my dad, I couldn't be a replacement
I yearn for plates with catfish and collard greens
You got me into school, off of Mama schemes
I know I can lean, on you for anything
Ain't have to want for nothing, you my everything
They say we don't get to choose our mothers
Somehow I know our souls chose each other

Saint something, please protect this family
Give cover, from the world's insanities
I know you got a lot on your plate
The stress is on a lot of your faith
And no matter what's coming
I will be there, I will be there

Jesus walked across my lawn
And told me you the mom I'm supposed to have
Nobody in my life is as close as that
If I'ma write you a song ain't no holdin' back
Now, I wasn't raised in no cul-de-sac
You said, "Stay in school," 'cause you ain't know I rap
Teachin' me in moments I ain't know was class
That's why every girl I go home with be showin' class
When I show my ass, you gave me a whippin'
The paradigm shifted and parentin' is different
Black woman strength in search of vulnerability
You did everything you could and did it willingly
Instilled in me values of what a child do
To say you my Ma, I'm ever so proud to
You wrote me letters to get myself better
I still cherish when we pray together
That's a time I really feel the Lord
I thank you for the your declarations and your vision board
It hit a chord, when they rolled you into surgery
Mama, you the sky and earth to me

Saint something, please protect this family
Give cover, from the world's insanities
I know you got a lot on your plate
The stress is on a lot of your faith
And no matter what's coming
I will be there, I will be there

I'm into Chi-Town heroes like Fred Hampton
And neighborhood Deebos, the rebirth of D. Rose
The eye of a eagle, I keep on the people
Some gettin’ repoed, some Niclo
Since I was a shorty I had vision like Calico
Opportunity knocks, I'm lookin' through the peephole
In my daughter’s laugh, I can hear a deep soul
E was my first love, now I'm on the sequel
Heart stay open, in you I keep gold
Crossroads of beast mode to peace mode
Southeast cold, Avalon to Eckersall
Too much on my back to set it off
From the offset, I just wanna be, be, be
Like Cardi or 'Oncé, or Harry Belafonte
Whenever I eat, my peeps get the same entrée
Like they my fiance
It ain't easy, when niggas like, "Feed me"
When I ain't got it they don't believe me
Read me truth, lead me truth
The birth of freedom can't be induced
We reproduce, so our fruits can see
The fruit's a harvest for the world that the mustard seed produced
Faith walk my thoughts through yellow tape and chalk
Tiger style, gettin’ it back on course

And I know we will prevail (Will prevail, will prevail)

Man, I'm strugglin', man, I be strugglin’
'Til something inside tell me to come again
Like when you fuckin' and you get another wind
I'm from the City of Wind, that's another win
Take the L, green line, red line, get your paper, headlines
Tryna feed your fam, get fed time
It happens, trappin' and rappin' got us backed in
To a corner, it's normal for black men
The Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley reenactment
Savion with a beard, yo, I'm tapped in
Stretch money and make it do a back bend
Frontin' niggas try to front you on the back end
Live from the Chi' where, guns be clappin'
Poetic justice, with raps I'm snappin'
Meditatin' took Kamasi song, ask him
Robbin' in Baskin, our heroes ain't masked men
When I do it, Com' do it with passion
My compassion for brown and black skin
In the hood I used to backspin
Now I'm spinnin' back in the hood
When I'm back, "Yo, what's good?"
If you stand up, then that's understood
I tell the black sheep, "Don't react to them wolves"
Crib love, our heroes are on murals
So five Euros get told in their earlobe
That they can let fear go
Souls clear the way, let these palms pirouette
Or pirouette, in the silhouette of blackness and cigarettes
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well
They want us to be in jail
But you know we'll never fail
We goin' up, yeah, we goin' up
No this soul is not for sale
I won't put that on them scales
And I know we will prevail (Prevail, prevail)
 
I-I-I-I don't support the rights of people because I'm a politician

My first memory, my birthday on a party bus
Pops wasn't there but that wasn't obvious
In Mom's arms, in God we trust
Black Mama love, everything marvelous
I didn't know what I was missin', part of a system
Pops is gone, Uncle in prison
Inside wishin' for men to teach me 'bout girls and religion
Made my own rendition of grindin' and kissin'
Weekend calls to my Dad I'd listen
Still I felt distant, distant like love
There's only so far that words could really hug
Didn't wanna be a thug, older niggas I banged with
I learned a lot from them cuts in the basement
The smell of blunts laced with a little bit of spice
Wise, high niggas, giving me advice
We go out and start fights, scuff up our Nikes
Come back to talk crap and shoot a little dice
This is a slice of life and memories
Sittin' in my mind vividly, often they visit me

Oh baby
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da (Oh, oh)
I'm just tryna find a way to understand (I'm tryna understand)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
How do I rewind the tape and live in it? (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Stayin' out late and playin' in Wonderland (Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Is it in God's plan?

Metaphors can't explain how far I came
A young man at work, I made my own lane
Steered away from pain, relied on drive
There's a old saying, "Don't cry, survive"
As I kept building there were cranes in the sky
Certain memories my brain would deny
A tear laid in my eye, I was afraid to reply
To the hurt that was callin', it came from the sky
An older play cousin, of course I trust him
But he was touchin' where he wasn't supposed to be touchin'
What's a kid supposed to do?
When they goin' through, what I was goin' through
Don't know who to go to
You want to tell somebody
In many ways, I failed somebody
That somebody was me
Now I'm talking to little Rasheed
Incarcerated heart, man, you gotta be free
I felt it, when I told my man I would help with
Things he was dealin' with I really hadn't dealt with
Emotions meltin', I began to release it
Things you can't change, you could come to peace with
At least get it better for the children of forever
I read the Lord's letter, I forgive our debtors
They don't talk about it, maybe sharing their story
Memories of home, shared pain and glory

Embedded in emotion, I'm open, hopin' whoever's
Calling's all in for the low-key, it was O-M-O-Y-E
I read my daughter's name slowly, I'm asleep, sleepin'
With the TV on, two in the morn', "Who the hell is this?"
On some Biggie Warn', something's wrong, what's going on?
You should be under covers, warm, is there a thunderstorm?
Someone done you wrong? Words stumbled on, she mumbled on
Something's on, oh shit, she lit, a habit she got, legit
We talked a bit, truthfully I was tired
Youthfully, she was high with her friends, I said bye quick
The phone collided with my sleep again, three minutes later
But there's another layer, she said I didn't care
She said I wasn't there when she was younger
Summer tour buses wasn't enough to show what love is
She said I did things that a dad doesn't, and that she had questions
If I'm a good father, why all the bad judgement?
I'm looking past judgement, about to ask somethin'
But she was bag bustin', inside I'm mad, cussin'
Inside I'm sad, dustin' off my pride
I thought that I did protect and provide, and I'm a father that's live
What about them rides with you in the backseat?
You tellin' me if it's a wack beat, I came to a few track meets
Weekend movies, I got you tickets to Lil' Uzi
Truly I try, she said
"It's the things that you didn't do, not what you did"
It hurt her spirit when she saw me with another woman's kid
Peeled back and thought, to love her, I gotta listen
Now love and action is the new vision, she said
"Dad, let your actions be your loudest speaker"
And now my daughter is now my teacher, with love

They say it never rains in Californ'
That done changed 'cause of global warming
Depends on what you use for a lens
I was told God used rain to cleanse
In you I got a friend, your kin is my kin
I prayed for a woman, so I say amen
A gift in my life that can't be boxed in
You don't complain when I watch SportsCenter Top 10
Over and over again, no more holding it in
Let's write a love story, we don't know where it end
I'm beginning to understand and understand women
Yeah, understand forgiving, understand commitment
Understand living in love with no division
Understand she gon' be like, "Nigga, just listen"

So close, the future don't seem as distant

The unconditional, critical mission, listen to
The indivisible, mystical, it was meant for you
And meant for me, infinitely
Even been to prisons to visit you
Ask, "What would Christians do?"
Well some are harassing Native Americans
If God is love, why is hate in the air again?
Search for Samaritans in the hood, misunderstood
A savior comes, will he only come for the good?
The lost tribe of Shabazz and the second class
God, I see you in the streets where the checks is cashed
Hear you in the heartbeat, hopin' that love'll last
I know you in the words, "Where the first is last"
They try to use math to quantify you
In 2005, you saved lives by the Bayou
I know you in the mouth of the spouse singing, "I do"
The most vital is how I describe you

Even when the hard times come
I'll be standing in your love
Grateful, grateful for this life
You turned on the light (Hey, hey)
Even when the hard times come
I'll be standing in your love
Grateful, grateful for this life
You turned on the light

It's coming from where Maya and Pop are

"Love is love" became the mantra
The montage for creation, we need it in relation
When two ships pass, one love is the flotation
It's what God used to put the planet in rotation
It's what the culture used to build a hip hop nation
From the basement to the attic, where cookie show for magic
It's what we told the world when we said our lives matter
Turn the student to a master, hustler to a pastor
That's why I'm a rapper, it's all that I'm after

Champagne poppin’, bad thang poppin’
Headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’
Nooo
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’
Campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’

I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gon’ do it gourmet
I’m hearing fuckin’ voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made  his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This broad from the DR said I was frío
That’s Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time
I’m gambling with watches getting better with time
So I’mma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say “time is money”, forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display

Bars in alignment, stars in alignment
Raw off consignment, God’s in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that’s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I’ve seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I’m a rare diamond that’s hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 to 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain’t no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me
Diamonds
Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I’m rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin’ that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say “I need that fadeaway”
Had a crush on what’s her name, them feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can’t take his chain away
Real player you can’t take this game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can’t take my dame away
Devil in a red dress, but she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day-to-day-to-day-to-day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me off in court, beating all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that’s my favorite compilation

Thousand lives ago
We were young, and we didn't know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice, headed back to the light
But be careful, don't drown in the gold
I know it glows, but it's cold
I'm from the other side of town, out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones?
And Four CHs, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix, street organizations
They gave violations, hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces
The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us
The era of Reagan, the terror of Bush
Crack babies, mamas a-push, we were the products of Bush
I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to BBD "Do Me"—you heard of Flukey?
Stokes? It was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation, diamonds, blinding us
Some real shit we facing
Forties wasting on seats, Dion making the beats
When they air it out on at the parties, we escaping the heat
"I could break it down, like, whatever you need"
He squinted his face and rolled the weed

It's the Chi bullshit I'm on
Make a dome from a brick and a pocket full of stones
Hit them cones, clips and crones
I don't play away games, I got hitters at home
I'm a dime like six in the morn'

Her misconception 'bout what love is, she passes on
The child she brings in to the world don't know
Right from wrong
Her soul is sore, she deserves more

Red lipstick bo', French press col'
You know she queen bee by the way she wear her gold
Honey gettin' money the ass is stupid
She far from a dummy funny I thought she came from money how she makin' money
At the club going hard like liquor
Shots of Ciroc she can out drink a nigga
Niggas dig her think they can take her to the crib and break her mover her shake her you can't fake her
She knows time is paper
Glaciers on her neck-uh
Pleasures on her finger
Gucci purse carry notes like a singer uh uh
Go to the steam room and she carry a steamer
Beamer, Benz, she got friends in high ends
She know trend she know when
She go in like an investor
Yes sir, never getting gassed like a Tesla
Ain't about all that extra

Swag like Angelina or more like Angela Bassett
Many aspects emphasis sophisticated and ratchet
She fasted for a week that's stronger than most
If she had kids she could mother father them both
Prominent host throw a party and she know everybody
Devil in a tight dress something that is golly
She know what niggas want she know how to make 'em hunt
Hotel suite at the Trump
The way she walk in them pumps
Talkin' 'bout takin' over the world while holding a blunt
She hold her man down when her man get locked up
Prada keep movin' she movin' and shake it like Parkinson's
Used to seel hot purses and network marketing

This is for my pretty women that know that they independent
You say that her shit is rented she probably get offended, man

Shots fired I got harder than a, nigga

Niggas is broke, what I need to brake for
Glaciers of ice, lasers, and lice

Fake ass gangster, quick to take a fag's cash
Five versus six, Star Wars
No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors
Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9's
Two trey 8's, and one 45
Tryna get to 23, numbers game
Then here come the fame
But they won't say no names
Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town
I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around
Popes, bishops, disciples, stones
Counts, princes, lords, queens, and kings
They drilling on my land but ain't no oil to be found
I might be part of the problem
I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up
Most of them can't even moonwalk
My little cousin Bump J don't know what he did when he introduced that goon talk
Is there a Scarface casting at the crib I don't know about?
So many shortys have tried out for the role
That's why he slide out and ride out with the pole
Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he discovered that black power didn't keep the lights on
Right on, the dearly departed still rapping to you
Looking for some yellow, white, red, black, brown flesh to write on
How long will they mourn me after I'm out of mind, out of sight, gone
A crash, a head-on collision affects both riders the most

Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Gluttony, baby
Is us, it's hard to see
It's knocking
Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Man, they gon', they gon'
Man they gon' knock this
And ride out to this

It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh, y’all don’t need the address
It was ‘round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler's insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that he'll end up in a grave
It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOP
They say use them rocks to make 'em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony
When niggas fucking with you but commit infidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it
Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat
It’s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It’s a dude that’s getting paid in full, cars and jewels
So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon' want your food
Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that's in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other
Greed is a mother, it’s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we livin'
The good thing is we can be forgiven

His voice rare, talk with a mumble
Chicago Bear hat, quarterback the huddle
Call an audible of trouble came
His name Chris, black as his hustle name
Reaction to his chains, it's like a basketball game
Watch him winning, hope your team do the same
A menace, he O-Dog, Caine
Wish a nigga would go against his grain
Used to staying but moved up in the game
Take a nigga spot, take a nigga fame
The fortune of a caine, long live his reign
He do it for a son, he do it with a gun
Whatever he do, yo, he do it till it's done
A team full of hitters, so they hit and run
The priest don't even want none
Walk with the G's cause the G's never run
Something to be from the slum and be the one

It's the circle of life, that's why we're turning
Yo, I hit a choir and a sermon, our messiah is returning
With a tile around my neck, a style around respect
Know the smell of good pussy and the sound of a tec
They fire, drill, stop dropping roll
I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold
The way of the road is our ode to the legacy
C'mon dog, you know my pedigree
Finding Forever, Be, the sun never set on me
Many reign, but the game never weather me

Wearin' articles of black like Ebony

No fear, I say that with levity

Rewind that one time please
Rewind that one time please

Should it be, can it be simple?
Life is like the tempo of a No-I instrumental
Things that we been through define who we are now
Since "Can I Borrow a Dollar?"
Ooh, I'm a star now, coming from Chi-town
We was the first to do it
Me, No I.D., Twilite Tone on the music
The city on our back, we was the opening act
Throw our tapes in the crowd, they throw 'em right back
But we stayed on track, they stayed on the tracks
I stayed on the raps 'til we made it on the map
By then, No I was my main guy
He and I was like Chi-town's Gang Starr
We had came far together, with a long way to go
Seeing a bigger picture, but now from different angles
Tangle of the hustling, survival in the game
Felt I had to leave home to be a household name
Show money low, needin' to stack fast
City did have my back, now it's a backlash
Was I a slave to the cash and wanting it so bad?
I just became a dad, rap was all I had
So I moved to New York, to make it pop
Did Like Water for Choc, that album changed a lot
But my man who I started with, wasn't a part of it
And his presence I didn't even acknowledge it
Knew I was wrong, he shoulda at least had a song
It wouldn't be me without No I.D., and Twilite Tone
Wishin' I could get that time back
Oh I can, yo man, rewind that
Me and Dion back in the zone, I'm doing shows with Tone
For the future of the Chi we gon' bring it back home
Rewind that and we could do it again

Cuz wasn't non' realer than James  Dewitt Yancey
So I'mma dedicate this to Dilla and his family
In Q-Tip's basement, I first met Jay Dee
I still remember the first beat he played me
He came to the Chi laid three that was crazy
Didn't even know me and gave 'em to me for free
I go to the D, "peace yo, big love"
Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club
Then we made "The Light" and times got brighter
I said "turn it up" Jay'll take it higher
One day, I noticed he was tired quick
That's when I found out, Jay Dee was real sick
Things got worse before they got better
I said, "Come to L.A. for peace and good weather"
We got an apartment just so we could spark it
MP in the front room, records in the closet
The beats got iller, but the sickness was still there
I'm wishing I could will him out of his wheelchair
It was hard for me to come home every day
And see my homie Jay's life fade away
I stayed away some times, in other words I ran
Til one day J brought me this TV stand
It was a gift so I couldn't refuse it
It came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it
The lupus got worse and, for what it's worth
I wanted him to have a Grammy before he left this earth
Wishing we could have that time back
Oh we can, yo man, rewind that
Rewind that one time please
Rewind that one time please

You never gone, you live forever through song
I feel it when I seem 'em with them Dilla shirts on
I know you're still shining, from heaven you watch me
Watch me put this Grammy on the stand you got me

I ride around town like this is my town
Rapping to myself, trying to see how I sound
Kinda arrogant 'cause I’m from Chi Town
East bound & down, that’s how we get down
At the bar taking shots like they live rounds
My lifestyle is it’s good to be alive now
Lot that surround me, places all cloudy
Came in the Audi, pied piper rowdy
You in the 'Raq where it's war like Saudi
Youngins carry the iron man, like Robert Downey
Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle
Surround me loudly, wildly is how we came up
Think about the come up
That’s why I’m always on edge when the fans seem to run up
Hair all done up, we can spend the summer together
But when the weather change, lady friend
You may be forever stranger lines seem to blur
Yea I like you but I still love her, uh uh uh
I come from the under, wonder why they slumbered on a nigga
Now I see the bigger picture, pour a little liquor
The rich get richer, my dick get bigger
'Cause I’mma go hard, g-go g-go hard
The more I know self, the more I know God
Coppin’ land from my bro Monar
Good to do business with the bro-gods, let the dollar circulate
Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit
In touch with the crib that’s why you feel this shit

I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait
To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, money by her Bible
The type of bitch that B.I.G. said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
Tats on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform

I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin'
Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic
They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted
'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence
But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra
African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours
She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors
Half hood half class, photographers' cameras
Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Events having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams

Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder, yeah
Yeah, it's for the people

This is street radio, for unsung hero
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new Preemo
'Ye, you know how we do, we do it for the people

And the struggle of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folk focus on dogs and yoga?
While people on the low end tryna ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin', tryna get them custom rims
Law, we ain't trusting them, thick broads, we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it, I look on the bus at them
When I see 'em struggling, I think how I'm touching them
The people

At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what, the people gon' see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

Standing in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake
The People

"Down to wreck and like collect or put your body in park" - Biz Markie

Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot
Brew is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Toe cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a masseuse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
Man, when it's time for some action I get red, tonight's da night
An eye for an eye, a life for what's right
Dissect it I'm on hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm went to F.A.M. and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit uh I'm the locksmith
Studied the missionary waitin on my life, the mic I Rush like Boss is
I switch styles like a channel with controls that is remote
Engage in a page, and with words I elope
Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the vow(el)s
That tie knots when I rocks like a Z-28
At any rate, brothers gain interest cause I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
It's like that, coming from the Go rapper
I wanna bone Jada Pinkett and that ho Patra
So keep on, and you don't, now come on
Ah keep on, and you don't

"Down to wreck and like collect or put your body in park" - Biz Markie

When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it
I get charged like a nigga in position with a stolen card of credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me "Never", they be like "Never's going to get it"
Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!"
Other studs come through to see what I am up to
They be on the dick of crew giving us weed and buying us brew
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out cause they look up
Rest in peace to Harold, I'm washing tons of rappers like Booker
T. told me "You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world"
How you going to come off with the style that's sterile?
It's like that, keep on, ha ha
It's like that, keep on

"Down to wreck and like collect or put your body in park" - Biz Markie

My foundation is a black block of niggas that rock they hat cocked
I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox
Back I got my rap cocked get your Glock out the black face
Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rap race is a rat race
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you
Hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before then I was getting big dog like Glenn Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta come off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I rip rhymes on the incline
Splat guts bust fat nuts and lay up like a crip line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one
I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on

Excite-ting, enlight-ning, invite-ing
I'm writing shit that I feel
Raps are black steel in the hour of commotion
The motion of Com is like that of a ocean
Devotion 'cause I'm the Earth, Wind, and Fire of hip-hop
By Rakim and Short, I've been inspired
My shit knocks environ...ments of cats with seventeen's
Tint, time is money, the mind is funny, how it's spent on getting it
I'm sitting with descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is "money, cash, hoes"
I went from bashful to asshole to international, lover of self
Word to the mother on my last record cover, it's felt
Now deal with it

I wanna get into it
Let’s do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So let’s just get into it
Let’s do this
Can you feel the music?
The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music

In this never-ending battle to please
Niggas, magazine writers, emcees
Who request hot shit, I freeze
And tell them where I was rose, we always said cold
Hold your horses and your carriages
This never-went-gold nigga rocks shows carat-less
You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage
Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this
And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had dreams of fucking R&B broads, it came true
Journalist I wreck, shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee
Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me
Some say "You changing, Rashid"
Times are, we still close
I rhyme far, away away away
From what you accustomed to hearing everyday, uh-ah
You know the dope-choppin, gun-poppin, homies dying
I'm amongst it, save the war stories for Private Ryan, INI

Women cry, children laugh, men dance
I refuse to lose self and try to win fans
Over, weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprah's
My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra
You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay emcees, just don't come around me with it
You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger, eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs, of Mary J. Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky
My verse depth, is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing, inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a range when it's time to head home?

"Resurrection"

Yeah I'ma get this one off for 87th Street
South Side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere, check it
It's like come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town

I stagger in the gatherin', possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
In it's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense

I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight then write some shit that's skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
When it's my turn to go, I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

Aston Martin king, Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I’m like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada, stay mellow like lala
Young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga
I’m the cum-lada, top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask, pure religion and cash
From the windows that open, I’m raising my glass
Daylight beams, night life schemes
This is my inception, I’m writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through
You might also like
Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

It all started with a dream, I wanted to be Run–D.M.C
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M, dreams were spoken to him
That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or
D. Rose, from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care, my music is the medicine
My name holds weight, I am never hesitant
Different state resident, this is hood elegance
SLS classic, pursuing my passion
NOVA Fashion, now I'm Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through
Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right
Aye, aye-aye, aye, aye, hey
Aye, aye-aye, aye, aye, hey
Aye, aye-aye, aye, aye, hey (Aye-aye-aye-aye, aye)
Aye, aye-aye, aye, aye, hey (Aye-aye-aye, aye, aye, aye)

Silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh
Even now it don't seem so bad, ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm gone now, imagine what I'm gonna be
Dirty to worthy, now I'm all wordy
My broad up in Paris, looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running til' I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, until high we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right12Embed

I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us
These are the words of a believer, achiever, leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and it's process
Birth of a son, death of another
With love I caress both mothers
And told 'em, who’s in control is the one that's above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
It’s tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us?
Look at the picture, hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them?
Is it what we talking, we really ain't walking?
Dues hustlers pay, how much did it cost 'em?
Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em
Real talking, in their ear like a Walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the world
When I see them, I see my baby girl, believe!

With the steel up on the dresser killing will aggressors
Destiny’s children survivors, soldiers
In front of buildings their eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons, sirens, holsters
That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning, shawty’s know to keep learning
Lesson’s in our life are like stripes that we earning
Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors
Of a contest that seems beyond us
Even through the unseen, I know that God watches
From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us

Starin' into the darkness like Marcus
Garvey, I'm an artist, respect to the goddess
Somе say I'm too modest because I'm thе hardest
On this path to progress, there's been carnage
Regardless, this is a harvest for the world to harness
Elder's dreams, creator's promise
Bein' free is like payin' homage
I've been on that peace, black Dalai Lama
My college was between Stony and Cottage
The knowledge, I got it because niggas was 'bout it
Knew I had to pull it, the bullet or the ballot
It's like the parable of the story of the talents
Want my people to get paper, with no margin
Turnin' ghettos to gardens like Ron Finley
Through stages of life, the world's my Wembley
I emcee, from the point of entry
Of peace (Peace) some find it all through their paper routin'
And some find they peace, they peace through praise and shoutin'
And some find they peace through pullin' the shades like Malcolm
I found my peace, my peace makin' these albums, peace

In dystopia, ground zero from xenophobia
They love to trope me or misquote me, they even wrote me
Out of all accounts other than shoulderin' small amounts
'Til I called them out, I'm what the story is all about
My arrival wasn't willingly, nah, but that's chillingly
The truth, now I fear from shots from cops killin' me
They on the hunt for the plug, and we the auxiliary
The Black power and love, I'm all the above
We'll find peace in the culture I'm responsible to save
And every piece of the puzzle, every article, the page
I'm at peace in the struggle, I'm awake and not afraid
While I'm channelin' my energy from particle to wave
The peace, like Mandela seated on Robben Island
Wise like a prophet arrivin' from the highlands
Look, I'm not here for any kind of problem
Keep me out of your gossip column
Thank you, I'm calm and tranquil at the time and place too
I shine, word to God, I'm divine and graceful
The grind could break you, if you concentrate
You could find your faith where the higher conscious takes you
That's peace
Say peace, we don't really want no trouble

Ain't it beautiful?
When we smile, it's a musical
An act of revolution and the stage is a human one
Some people spend their lives wearing the costume
When the script is Sanskrit in the palms of our worship
The same hands we go to work with
The same hands we go to work with, put the real work in
Meditation and stillness so your focus is the realest
Screaming from the outskirts when your voice is the clearest
Wishing for answers inside of elections
When justice was just born right inside your reflection
Here we stand, survivors of holocausts
Oceans of bodies, bound and lost
Our dreams swam across
Found the will to still live at all costs
The true mastery itself, honoring tears
Loving the mirror beyond your greatest fears
A small army traveling beneath your skin
Walking alone if you need to, the revolution's within
Our bodies birth sons wrapped around Earth's axis
Spinning the way people do when change is necessary action
Our ancestors saw us in the future
Imperfect perfect beams of light
A sacred prophecy of what's possible, be still, and still the night
We are centuries of grace
The internal uprising, the creation of race
The spiritual warfare is the one you can win
An army of angels begin where we end
We beautiful broken, warrior ready in soulhood
The wish and the wish you would
The daughter of drum spangled banners
We are the tearing down, are falling together
Our cosmos, our stars, a subtle peace
Ain't it a miracle to simply feel safe?

They loved him when he shot ball, they loved him when he ran
They loved him when he rapped, they loved him when he danced
But really didn't love him when he was out with his fam
Couldn't love him in the hood or selling CD's
And couldn't love her when she was in her house sleep
I'm wondering if it's love if it's really love at all
'Cause in that type of love, we fall

When this world try to change you
Who you are, just embrace it
Stay courageous

Unapologetic, unashamed with it
Times in life, I came with it
When the unseen became vivid
Of different flesh, same spirit
It's like a lyric by Stevie Wonder
Through inner visions, you can see the wonder
Spent time in life being the runner
Couldn't run from what I've seen this summеr
Tryna understand where wе are in time
Looking at the world, keeping God in mind

And be a bearer of fruit on the planet
Guided steps I don't take for granted

No justice or justification
We trust in God but can't trust in a nation
The cusp of generations searching for a ventilation
If 2020 vision is any indication
Of where we are, where we've been, where do we go?
American ain't legible
My rights are being left behind
In questioned times, they say invest in nines
Tryna rest my mind, the press be pressed to find
Stories by my kind, a suggested crime
Though many, many holler about justicе reform
But won't put dollars where thе hustle is born
You know our politicians, they like to perform
Acting and singing that government song
How they love America when you lovin' it wrong
We the people are becoming reborn

What is a beautiful revolution?
(A beautiful revolution)
A beautiful revolution is when old and outdated ideas
Are replaced by new and better ones
Everybody's in peace, everybody's shaking hands
A beautiful revolution?
The Earth going around the Sun, it's a beautiful thing
(The truth is, revolution can be small
It's in the stillness, and it can be painful and warm
Because it's happening on the inside first
It can't happen out there unless it's happening in here)
(A beautiful revolution is a truthful revolution
A revolution that balances the extremes of
Of inner and outer, light and dark, good and evil
Masculine, feminine, black, white)
(People were able to change other peoples' minds
Without any loss of life and without any shedding of blood)
{That's a beautiful revolution}
{That's, that's what a beautiful revolution looks like to me}

And finally, we take us back
The boat and the big house
My body, my thoughts, our words
Our fate, my people, our peace, my people
Come, sit down for a spell
We gather to announce our freedom
Unafraid to turn our backs, and we can bring you
And nobody wants us dead
And we are free to rest and tend our wounds
Give us this day to grieve who we could've been
Give us this day to bless the Atlantic floor
To worship what was stolen
Give us more than survival
Weave fists, glistening with blue magic and black glory
Only roses in our mouths
We pray like this, we keep us safe
We can breathe, we give us breath
And we is us again, amenYou might also likeEmbed

Only difference is

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Once you find your shoulders dropping
And your speech gets slow and hazy
You'd better change your way of being
Before you found your brain got lazy
You can build a better future when you join the winning team
If you desire a bright tomorrow, you must build a brighter dream
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
And stood half naked on auction blocks
From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
And were mis-named on Ellis island
From South America and Mexico, from Asia, they labored in sweat shops
From all over the world, they came to America

So we made it to this same end of the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my
Soul, Ohh, ohh! Ohh, ohh!

Ashtrays and cigarretes, last days, indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was born, three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess it's my addiction to women
I was in France, in to see Hennessy blending
Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian
On the mic, victorious, story is redemption
You might also like
I'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone
I'm standing here with my
Soul, Ohh!

Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like I was 5-0, but my creed's Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
This is the Kilimanjaro, like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival
Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido
Crash parties, any live yo
Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang
From the pride we'll reign, kill the game and watch it die slow
Ali MC, I fight for more than the title
Your idol

So we made it to this same end of the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my
Soul, Ohh, ohh! Ohh!
How I made it out with my
Soul, Ohh, ohh! Ohh, ohh!

We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
Ka-clow boom pop! Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her, it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you, I admit I had issues
Like ebony, your essence, your pedigree, your presence
It's more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust
From the cloth
Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear
But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh
La la la la, la la la la

This is tailor-made love, fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs
You were there when my cuz passed away
Not only does love, but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you
Looking at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessing
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it, that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take its course
Cause what's inside of us, no need to outsource
The cloth


Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights, tight never smother
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's the cloth

If your eyes are the window to your soul
Open eyes bring the cold
If your dreams keep you warm in night
Baby just keep 'em closed
If your eyes are the window
I can sneak in at night
In your eyes I can see your soul
Staring back into mine

She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men, we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she sparkles
You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose
I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close, there grows a new one
I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok, sometimes from commitment, we do run
Rocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian
I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision
But not to be married with kids she was wishing
Shhh, 'til your soul just listen

She said daddy take me ice-skating
Looking at the rear-view, life's waiting for her
Gotta be there to support her
Can't really wait for a court order
She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant
A lot of love inside, got to help guide it
Daddy will protect it, God will provide it
We all will be there so your soul ain't divided
Man, how quick she grows
Looking like her momma but she got my toes
I suppose it's the age that she really really need me
A lot of girls without, they become needy
"Come on, Dad, I'm too old for the back seat
Can you come and get me, are you coming to my track meet?"
As she begins the race of life and love I told her
"I can't run it for ya, but God know's I'ma coach ya"

Yeah, yeah, bring it on
Uh huh, with the ya ya, yeah
Just sitting around kicking it a little bit
I thought we would record something tonight
And I do want to dedicate it to two very outstanding people
I live the spirit of
Gentlemen Crispus Attucks and Mr. Marcus Garvey
Thank you so much
The Believer
If I were a believer, I believe I would believe in the beginning
Everybody's beginning
Mine, that my very first ancestors were front row and present
When God stepped to the mic
I believe from the creation of the Garden of Eden
The separation of the tribes
Our long marches across the desert
Being Yacub's kids
For instincts born in caves of ice
All, each and every one, the souls of one God
Granted earthly existence to allow each to earn
The blessing of transcending, time-traveling throughout the universe
With the blessings and well-wishes of my fathers, prophets of my own
No search, no fear no mysteries
We inherit the power to turn nightmares into dreams
For those of us who come from less than enviable circumstances
Dreams, good dreams, sweet dreams, dreams come true
Truthful dreams, truthful dreams become life
Life becomes belief, belief becomes live!
Live the life you believe
The American dream, the black American dream, the universal dream
For the sake of the unwritten laws of humanity, I believe in God
I believe in my ancestors, I believe in my offsprings
I believe in Dr. Sebi, I believe we must stop Willie Lynch'n each other
I believe in the truth, truth

I remember she sit there with her thickness
Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is "gonna get'cha"
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, God be with us
It was hard for me to take down the pictures
I was tripping, I even called her sister
I could be someone you could talk to each and every day
But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
'Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love, huh, just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together

After bein' 25 you know just trying to survive in the world
About to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?
Anyway just when you start gettin' that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves
So bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it

Yo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn
Began, began with time
Being my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brother, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the devil's White
Well, the devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Qur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doing right and got you this far
Whether you say "in Jesus name" or "Hum do Allah"
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
'Cause when the trumpets blowin', 24 elders surround the throne
Only 144,000 gon' get home
Only 144,000 gon' get home
Only 144,000 gon' get it, baby

I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned

Sunshine, pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me

Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn, something in me wanna know who I am
So I began my search, my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
Takin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White
Some leads were granted with insight
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So, with following I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas
You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain

Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talkin' straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they soles, niggas holdin' they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rollin' in droves
They shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain’t knowin' they goals
The streets ain’t safe 'cause they ain’t knowin' the code
By the foes I was told: "either focus or fold"
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them

Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right
Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three stripes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hopin' it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feelin', uh-uh
Uh-uh-ugh, on the corners, niggas robbin', killin'

Uh, the corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful
Black church services, murderers, Arabs servin' burgers
As cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people workin' and earnin' this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money movin', the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give you this feelin', uh-uh
Uh-uh-ugh, on the corners, niggas robbin', killin'

I been dreaming of a paradise
Somewhere a little Paris-like where I wanna be
Let's travel to the greener side
A lovely place inside my mind, don't you want to see?

Imagine layers in a game where we all players
No more stargazing or police car chasing
Imagine life that bring us Lauryn Hill-type of singers
Even the righteous schemers still let Christ redeem us
Life is greener on this side, the bеauty that we see
Be coming from inside, imaginе if
You a God and she a goddess
My people get free, locked up from weed charges
We no longer targets or bodies on the market
Clean water coming out of Flint faucets, it's awesome
Not being petty, but got petty cash
Everything on the path we already have
Imagine having a woman like Betty Shabazz
Steady with class, ready to blast 'til the chariots pass
To take me to my new destination

Push out the noise
Songbirds replace the morning commute
Face adjusting to the lack of sunshine in the blink of an eye
We know exactly where we were when the world stood still and grounded all the stars
On our back porch patios relearning the subtle art of breathing
Our tribes, our well traveled scars
We found warmth inside a family of arms
Connected with other mothers
Crafting countless lives and transforming two-bedroom apartments into theatrical stages
Ceilings covered in constellations
Learning really begins at home now
We remember every lyric to every song ever played
Living room is the dance floor
God bless the DJs
Perhaps the battleground and our peace of mind our suspended on the edge of Earth
Balancing gracefully right outside our front doors
And the laughter of our brilliant boys and the de-silencing of our majestic girls
We (We) push out (Push out) the noise (The Noise)
What is more radical then authentic love?
Moon at half mass, masquerading as global light
I see the God in you, that's what goddesses do
I made you breakfast too, we eat at noon
We move time
Sometimes the bravest step is standing our ground
B-Girl stands defiant along these divided skies
The same hands that built all those churches dipped in gold
Palms open and breakdance pose into prayer position
Also made you dinner and kissed away all your fears
The ones that saw us in the future and prayed us into existence from the 1700's
We still here
Everywhere aliens
Where to win if not in our own mythology?
Where to find comfort if not in the arms of our lover?
Our children swing, our breath pushes them into possibility and whispers their stories into truth
Birth is never planned, but oh, how we first cry
Fly Sankofa style back into a safe place along his treasure chest
A few moments right before the sun sets when summer returns after winter wept
Tears become a necessary blessing, a holy water for the forgotten
We are praying to any ancestor listening
Ain't we always been a amplified joy?
A boombox altered for the descendants of drums and water bearers
A gathering of souls
A sanctuary surrounded by natural springs, the bling of butterflies
Headphone escape route, a survivor's anthem plays on
Someone will tell them, "We are still alive"
We fight inside the music on our own land
Built from ancestral memory and questions
When do warriors rest? When there is nothing left to die for
What have you learned from being inside?
There's still no place like homeYou might also likeEmbed

How we live it, it's intrinsic
Kismet kissed it, it's smeared like lipstick
Colorful on our souls
A mouth full of gold or a drummer's roll
Stories get told about us
That's why things so blah without us
Wherever we are you can feel the prowess
Whenever we move, yo, we turn the style up
I'ma just give Black power its flowers
Whether in the projects or the palace
Even when the pale horse tried to gallop
And stir, stir it up, we kept the balance
We move in silence, we move the loudest
Ancestors in my dreams, they move the wildest
They prayed about us, praised and shouted
Picture this country bein' brave without us
A slave's nostalgia, move through the woods with vigor

Used to call us, now they wanna be niggas

Oh gee, it can't be defined by me
When I set it in motion
Never question the motive
Mhm, mhm

Whether facing the East or facing the beast
I'ma keep fighting 'til the world say, "Peace"
Hollywood guilt put a nigga in grease
I'm God-bodied but devil's in the deets
But still I listen when Mohammad speaks
And get a good work when PT preach
My mama used to teach so it's lessons to learn
Before I step and repеat, I step and I earn
I met a girl's daddy, hе was kept in a urn
The world as we knew it, it was destined to burn
My success is a verb, it's a blessing to serve
My presence is heard, I'm investing in words

In a nation that asks me for identification
I'm a Haitian, I'm Jamaican
I'm forsaken, I'm mistaken identity
I'm Medgar Evers' memory
I'm my father's good and bad tendencies
I'm a man that love music but don't love the industry
Don't like when fake folk grin at me
I love Public Enemy
I love the messages my love be sending me
Chicago chase so I love being finicky
Love calling him "Cuzzo", even if he ain't kin to me
Love drinking wine while my homie drink Hennessy

Behind my eyes, I reach for skies that tell no lies
The earth, it cries for change that can't be televised
We polarized and synthesized by stimuli
My heart is why the parts all died, I can't deny
I realize your eternal eyes see through my disguise
These falls, what do they symbolize?
I know that you made me to rise
I need pain to feel alive when racism still alive
I was told that life's a bitch, hope that she don't kill my vibe
I've been still, but still, I rise
Lots of things I feel inside
Took some shots to still advise
Your grace and will are still alive
I can read again, believin' in the deeds amend

Everything is alright
I've been through a lot, but I'm fortunate
Feel it comin' from all sides
Heavy is the crown, but I'm passionate
And I know I'll be just fine
Understand the world, we're the same
I'll be alright
I've been through a lot, but I'm fortunate

Rain showers, brainpower
Thunder sparks can dark and light, live in the same hour
Live from the main tower
From the same flower as H. Rap
Grew up on concrete where we couldn't escape black
Listen to MCs who made me take thеy tape back
Rewind, black stars align
Help mе define exactly who I am
Know the voice of the lamb
Recognize the shepherd
Black Panther and leather
Won't jeopardize the leopard
From where my strength come is the same place I bled hurt
Crossin' the 7 is like crossin' a desert
Get ate like dessert 'cause ain't nothin' sweet
You might get a red shirt
I'm so fresh, man, I should be redshirt
Though I'm far from a expert
Master of style 'til my head hurt
My stepfather was a plumber
So I understand pressure
Bustin' the pipes and hustlin' nights
Scuffles and fights, my cousin's advice
Go harder, think smarter, be a model for the part of society that desires free

Footprints of the prophet on my soul, I'll shade
Halfway across the bridge, I saw a couple of kids
Who yell, "Black lives," but ain't know where Blacks live
It's okay, if you for it, you ain't against
You and your white pickets can help paint the fence
This is knowledge of self-defense
You felt the rinse of the brainwash
I hold weight like suspense
Thrillers, this is thriller night
Gods and monsters, odds to conquer
Squads with contra, bars and mantras
With my palms up, I ponder
Am I a son of Ghana or the one that squanders?
I'm glad I seen Bianca, she reminded me
No matter how far I go, to keep findin' me
I know that there's work on this earth that's assigned to me
I know there's a race between, between time and me
I'm locked in, find the key, my mind is free
I took time with me, it took time to see that—

Tell you something about poetry, it refuses
It breaks and asks to be broken
The broken pieces form a question mark
And this is the revolutionary poem, exclamation point
The radical belief that broken is beautiful
That breaking is essential
That revolution is built from wreckage
Exclamation comes from asking
The question is, "What use do we have for time not measured by the rivers dancing beneath us?
In us? Beforе us?"
We pray like this, majestic, еlectric
We slide, step, dip, shake, every room a dance floor
Let all my skin kin in, let sunshine in
Let me kiss on my loves chosen and fought for
Come, make you a plate
Pour some out
Return and get it
This is the thing about poems
They want to live
They remind us when we forget how to love and be love
How even leaves have veins with stories to tell
And we are the stories
We are the radical and hopeful
We are the revolutionary poem, exclamation point
You don't have to go home, but this is only the start
The good part is what comes nextYou might also likeEmbed

Though he remained, the song he sang is, "Keep your drive stay in your lane"

Yo, we gotta start respectin' life more y'all
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
We brothers gettin' changed real quick over nothin'
We losin' too many of ours
Gotta recreate y'all
Yo, check it

Knowin' you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours?
Cause I created you, irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin' the act I was a part of
The start of somethin', I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin' I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone, I would've fed this information I read
To someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin' your first breath, first step, and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin' out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about From now on I'ma use self control instead of birth control
Cause 315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth it

I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay

Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin'
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers, but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our parenthood to come from planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin', findin' myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my rod
Not have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of African names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
Now the situations made things change

Well I'm a two timer of women that are three times a lady
May Sadie say Sade and may Ms. Goldberg say
"Yo Whoopie, there it is"

More papers than the press, oh yes, I gets paid

And if you givin' your papers to a broad you'se a dummy
Cause without no money
(Ain't a damn thing funny)
(Ain't a damn thing funny)
(Ain't a damn thing funny)

Rhymes I exchange like stock, I'm live like stock
I rock like Prudential, making (haha) from O
That's mucho dinero, like Robert De Niro
A robber's dinero, a hero like the sandwich
A Manwich has mills like Stephanie Mills, dills like pickles
I'm fancy, man, I tickles like the French
Not Johnny but like Bench I press on like Lee
I stan' like Lee, while you stagger like Lee
Most likely I'll dagger that bull-ish I pull ish like a magnet
Or Dragnet, I don't drag I gets net income
Yo, bums I rush like adrenaline
I'm royal when I flush, your highest hush'll get mushed
Like a sleigh dog, I slay dogs who are under me
I'm over men; call me Doberman, cause I'm a Pinscher of pennies
That's pretty, leave your city green from all the money I spent
I stay fresh like a mint from mint
I meant my mint, know what I mean? I'm nice
Real friendly like an officer, friendly and a gentleman
Friendly like neighbors, not Jim
But like Gomer I got piles of loot
Attention, salute, I kill loot but won't dilute
Even if I threw garbage on the ground I couldn't pollute
Man, I'm too rich for that (Bitch!)
Ynot got the money
So what's your name?
I'm Ynot, I own a mansion and a yacht
I got essentials and credentials and honeys at my feet
And when I walk the street, I'm never lookin' bummy
Cause without the money
(Ain't a damn thing funny)
(Ain't a damn thing funny)
(Ain't a damn thing funny)
(Ain't a damn thing funny)
(Ain't a damn thing funny)

Ynot, let me tell ya a story
Okay it was a black man a white man and a Chinese man
The black man of course he was po' (Yeah)
The white man, he was rich (Uh-huh)
And the Chinese man, he owned a sto' (Aight c'mon)
Okay the black man lived on Beat Street
The white man lived on Wall Street
And at the Chinese man's store is where they all meet
Not really on the good foot
Cause the white man kept steppin' on the black man's toes (Damn!)
And in his shoes there were holes
But the white man didn't care, shit;
He didn't have to wear it (Uh-uh)
The scratch that he had, he got from his parents
With his tight ass, he woulda been poor white trash, but anyway
Everyday the black man would ask him to spare change
But at him, the white man would stare strange
So the black man got fed up
Cause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him
And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him
The Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon
And now the black man own the store
And the name of it is Leon's (What's that?)
Barbecue, that is! (Oh...)
Rib tips, hotsauce, mild sauce, fries, and chicken
So what's your name?
I'm Ynot, I own a mansion and a yacht
I got essentials and credentials and honeys at my feet
And when I walk the street, I'm never lookin' bummy
'Cause without the money (Ain't a damn thing funny)
Now what's your name?
Well I'm the Com, the broke Com Sense
And when I don't got scratch, I do feel tense
And if you givin' your papers to a broad you'se a dummy
'Cause without no money (Ain't a damn thing funny)

Will I see you?
Just talkin' about what I see
It's not opinion-based, it's just, just shit I see (Uh)

The suburbs are filled with ebonics and trap sonics
Frat boys sayin', "No cap, put racks on it"
The dialect got a lil' splash of some black on it
Cap and gowns bought by the money in dad's pockets
White girls squattin' tryna get that ass poppin'
Caught back-talkin' to their mom and dads often
Recitin' rap lyrics 'bout murder and cash profit
Get to feel like a thug but don't have to act on it
Local homicide rates got 'em astonished
Readin' 'bout it on a laptop and pajamas
Microsoft Office to complete their assignments
Never seen the hood, still can't help but have comments
Never had a convo with a kid from that climate
That really has trauma, that really got taught to survive by any means
Fuck bitches, stack commas
Common ground ain't that common

The festivals are filled with Larry Bird jerseys
College students in a hurry to jump to a four-count and say the "N" word
Business interns takin' Molly then Percs
Tramplin' on top of bodies in dirt
Condescendin' suburban kids growin' up to be rap journalists
Writin' urban myths about who they think is the best urban kid
And who the worst is and who's authentic
And what the real hip-hop is and who's all in it
Thrift shoppin' for articles and garments
That feel like they came from a foreign environment
Secondhand Bape, Supreme, and Gallery Dept.
Anything to feel less harmless
Adderall dealers carryin' 'round guns just to make it feel realer
House with white pillars
No rough, just diamonds
The education private, it's all by design and
Common ground ain't that common (Let me hear that)You might also likeEmbed

Yeah

There are times
When you'll need someone (Yeah)
I will be by your side (What's up, what's up)
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
(Yo, yo)

I never knew a luh-luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spеnd it slow forever
I know your heart is wеathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some ****** recognize the light, but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort, I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close...
To the Most, High
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my *****, or even my boo
There's so much in a name, and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anythin'
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognise sunshine
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh, darling
There is a light that shines (Yeah)
Special for you and me
(Yo, yo, check it)

It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know, to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!
There are times
When you'll need someone

Yo, niggas don't want none of this
Niggas know they can't fuck with this
Turn this shit up just a little more

I walk the night in rhyming armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat
Have him on Death Row searching for an Interscope
Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara
Symbolize dope like sirens do terror
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is getting traded
I drop a gem on them who's style is jaded
My juice is grated
Shit is so banging niggas say it's gang-related
On philosopher's rink of thought, I've skated with precision
Crews is getting split like decisions
Com'a let it ride and collision
Vision like Coleco or Intelli', I battle stars in stellar
Regions, my thought scheme was my like my offspring
Now it's teething
My reason to rhyme applies to season and time
Seizing the mind, body and regions divine
In mom's cookouts, I'm leaving the swine
Verbal vegetarian, squash beef with Ice Cube
Came in this rap life nude
Now I'm fully clothed with flows
You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes
Old niggas I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material, imperial and rugged like
Got mag, but my slugs a mic
You fake like a smile, like a hug, I'm tight
Skip ladies, this is rip-a-motherfucker night
Auricle air-outs, niggas don't even run for cover right
Downtown, interracial lovers hold hands
I breathe heavy like an old man with a cold can of Old Style
Hold a Stone Isle profile
Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild
Hold mics like a second nut until the second coming
Humming coming towards you with power like forwards do
Hip-hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm exploring you
Some wack niggas be cool, with them, I stay cordial
Flow at room temperature, cats is presumed miniature
Like golf, soft like Tiger Woods
At real nigga angles, I've stood with ways that's geometric
Don't need to rob banks with dyke broads to set it
I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme-wise, you a rest haven
You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven
You need to do more deleting and less saving
A praise in hell, raising heaven as the bill on my pager leavens
What you should have known from day one you will on day seven

I'm back in the studio, you know, I drove up
In the parking lot, and the parking lot was empty
Wasn't no cars out there like nobody wasn't even in here
All the doors were locked from the inside
But, I found a window cracked on the first floor so now I'm in here
Let's rap
So, I come in here, talk to my son, you know?
But, but, his next album he got comin' out
You know it's been such a spiritual feelin'
I had to come back in the studio just to see what he was doing
Cause I was gettin' those vibes all in the rocky mountains say, "I got to go,"
You know? I understand I'm finna' be a grandfather
And I'm so proud
I can say that in many ways, I can say I'm so happy, I'm so proud
You know? Son I wanna give you, you know?
Any direction in parenting at this stage
Because I think it's gonna come to you, just like it came to me
See you came to me and your mom from the spiritual world
We're just the physical parents, you know?
God loaned you to us, as God's spirit
We're the physical parents, you know?
Like I say, I'm not gonna give you no directions, you know?
But, I know when you started teaching me
See we talk about the life and education of one Lonnie Lynn
I think I'm the one that got taught, I do believe that, son, you know?
And I know when you started teaching me too
You know, I was hanging out, mad at the world
My professional basketball career was over
And I didn't believe in the red, white and blue anymore
And I was dissipatin' heavily, I wasn't experimentin', you know?
And one morning you looked across the table at me, it was like "What? Whatchu' gon' be? Whatchu' gon' do?
You got the responsibility to teach me the right things
You got the responsibility to teach me truth and respect and love, and safety"
You know? And my knees started gettin' a little stronger, you know?
I said, cause I can't get past these eyes man, it's just the eyes of a babe looking at me
And I couldn't look it off, I couldn't even play it off, you know?
And immediately I started gettin' the road maps seein' like how am I gon' do this?
I had to thank The Almighty for the strength, that he sent to me through you
So, I'm here to say, you know, thank you son
I'm here to say I'm so proud and numerous other things
Cause you've been a teacher to me, just like, I have supposed to be a teacher to you
Cause a lot of people think that parenting and raising a child is a one way street
But, you taught me continuous numerous lessons
And I love you my sonYou might also like1Embed
