73 ContributorsBlocka La Flame Lyrics
Dis type of shit happens every day
All dem I'm under mourn for people pon stay
But none of dem have the guts to pull out and spray
None of them have the guts to pull out and spray
Young Chop on the beat

I-I-I-I got diamonds on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka, to my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta, she be proper
Yeah, that's my flocka

I'm that Ferragamo Hussein, Tom Cruisin', Rock Of Ages
Semi-god estate, gettin' cake, could've thought I'm Jewish
Fuck, fuck, fuck, might lose your soul for my language
Nowadays's, niggas been at round tables talking all that heinous language
Plutonica, insomnia
Put that money on your head, Balenciaga yarmulke
Fifteen when I carried loads of them Ozium's
And them bag of nicks, I mean groceries
I mean daddy knows ain't no controlling me
My bad, look Scotty might sag
She give me head before the ass and never let no nigga smash
No puffing, no pass
We breaking if we can get half, thank you for making it last;
Get everything that you got
Break me a piece of that off, rest in peace niggas I lost
You might also like
I-I-I-I got diamonds on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka, to my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta, she be proper
Yeah, that's my flocka

Oh God, this shit too cold for the mink, Ye
Bang, bang, bang, my niggas ain't tamed
Might buried your ass in that Sphinx, mane
Sip Merlot, watch us make the champagne rain
Let my ding-a-lang hang
I'm a southside nigga where the 'caine reign
We running, summers, we running
Spring and fall, jogging be nothing
Winter, they cuffing, cuffing them up as they loving
The same month as my niggas stuffing
Riding through, rockin', Shaka Zulu
Block Crip or whole family blue; bloody, yeah, su-woo
Ain't you supposed to preach what you practice?
Put a rubber on if you stabbing
Get baptized if you baptist but ain't it evil to live backwards
Holy Ghost, hold on
Chakalu blakalu los: that's tongue for you niggas who lost
I-I-I-I got diamonds on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka, to my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta, she be proper
Yeah, that's my flocka34Embed
