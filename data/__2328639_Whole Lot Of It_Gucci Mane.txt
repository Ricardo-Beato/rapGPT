Yeah Yeah
Whole lot whole lot whole lot
Whole lot whole lot whole lot
Whole lot of it Whole lot of it 
Nigga Whole lot of it Whole lot of it

Need a whole lot a money whole lot a whip
Whole lot of chips whole lot of chips
A lot of my motor you can hear when it shift
Rev it out rev it out like a birthday gift
That shit you talking ain't true that's a myth
Neeb my money rightnow right on the 
Spend forty five hundred ten minutes and fifth
Gotta call her outside see her low on her lips
 work it out work it out
These niggas talking I don't know who they heard about
Got twenty thousand in the Louis V pouch
Louis V loafer, Louis V holster
You don't know how to cook dope nigga had to show you
You don't know how to chop  nigga had to coach you
Just a little car got a whole lot a motor
Can't hold out can't hold out
I kill my nigga  for some drugs
Playing hard i'll hit you in your mouth
Fuck your girlfriend and I put the bitch out
Old bitch one thing I don't even care about
Way we smoking bank roll nigga this loud
Man I gotta piss right now it's on five
Me I got scrubs right now it's on five
Got a young nigga with me and them niggas on call

Boy they wanna know if i’m working a whole lot
And you know i’m working whole packs
And you know i’m rolling out working that stove out

Man I charge em extra if I ever have to drive
Man that nigga said 1-5 but that nigga was lying
Whole bunch a pounds, whole bunch a rounds
What’s up in my trunk nigga I got a whole lot a sounds
Pull up to the club every time it going down
Whole lotta them things you know i’m passing them bills around
