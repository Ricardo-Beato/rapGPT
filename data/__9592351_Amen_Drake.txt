Father God
I come to You to say thank You
That's all, I don't wanna ask for anything, I just wanna say thank You, Lord
Thank You

Prayin', prayin' (Thank You)
Pray again, pray again (Thank You, Father)
Prayin' (Thank You, Lord)
Prayin' 'til you find a man
That's gon' treat you
That's gon' treat you like I can (Amen, amen)
That's gon' please you
That's gon' please you like I can (Church)

Church like a priest, Turks for the week
Purse for yourself, purse for your niece
Know you don't do Percs, baby, but (Take your time)
That's the perks of datin' me
Red Merces with the red seats
Buy red wig, part the Red Sea
With a neat freak, gettin' mess—
God, forgive me
Father, I've sinned
Sent more than your father ever sent
Spent more than your baby father did
And you my baby, so I gotta put you in the crib
Same neighborhood where Ashton Kutcher live
I'm just doin' what that punk should have did (Thank You, Lord)
She prayin' for me while I'm on the road
Prayin' for me while I hold her close
Prayin' that there's not no other girl
I'm prayin' that these girls'll never know
She prayin', asking God for a sign
I just went and paid her car note
You might also like
Turn to your neighbor
Say "Neighbor"

Prayin', prayin' (Neighbor)
Pray again, pray again (Everybody, say it)
Prayin'
Prayin' 'til you find a man
That's gon' treat you
That's gon' treat you like I can
That's gon' please you
That's gon' please you like I can
