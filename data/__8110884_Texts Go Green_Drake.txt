If I come around you, can I be myself?
Wind up in the mirror just to see yourself
If I was in your shoes, I would hate myself
Left all this behind to be with someone else, oh
Why should I fake it anymore?
If I firm the ting and work that can you take it anymore?
This time I have left, cannot be wasted anymore
You realize it now and you miss it

Texts go green, it hits a little different, don't it?
Know you miss the days when I was grippin' on it
Know you're in a house tonight just thinkin' on it
I moved on so long ago

I moved on so long ago
You're still thinking 'bout me, though, oh
I'm still tryna make sensе of it all
You're still saying things to keep me involved
'Posеd to let me know how you feel, now what to do?
It shouldn't take a text from me to speak your truth, rough

You're dealing with me rough
I know you like it rough
But this might be too much
You're dealing with me rough
I know you like it rough
But this might be too much
But this might be too much for me
You might also like
Dodging girls on the scene and girls from my dreams
Well, don't wanna make something from nothing, that's where I be
Well, keep getting nothing from something, how's that fair to me?
I'm thinking something for something, that's what I need
I'm too behind in a race to rush for my lead
I'm not rushing you, trust me, I'm
I'm the last person that needs to rush anything, wait
I feel like everything these days leads to nothing, wait
I feel like everything these days leads to nothing
It's clear that we all get lonely, then you call me
All I needed from you was to hold me down when things aren't working
For some reason, I believed in you

Texts go green, it hits a little different, don't it?
Know you missed the days when I was grippin' on it
Know you're in a house tonight just thinkin' on it
I moved on so long ago

So long ago
I can't even remember when we lost each other
Was it last year? This year? Or some other?
Been so long since you said things that cover up the lies
We can do it this time
Just have some faith, we can do it this time
Your favorite thing to say, "We can do it this time"
Just have some faith, we can do it this time
Been dealing with me rough
You're dealing with me rough
You're dealing with me rough
You're dealing with me rough
You're dealing with me rough
You're dealing with me rough
You're dealing with me rough
You're dealing with me rough
You're dealing with me
