Seem like girl got more heart than a nigga do

My lil' bitch a G
My lil' bitch a G
My lil' bitch a G
My lil' bitch a G
My lil' bitch a G
So I fuck her like we beefin'
And if she ain't with me
She feel like she creepin'
My lil' bitch a freak
I fuck her each and every weekend
And when she not with me
I look for her like we beefin'

Dope game hectic
Nigga don't get a pension
Oh, I forgot to mention
Chances of prison
Your bitch ain't missing
Nigga, you got me twisted
I'm Gucci, super friendly
Baby just couldn't resist me
Pillow-talkin', kissin'
Man, these niggas trippin'
If I'm just reminiscin'
Why you gettin' so defensive
Wait one minute
Ballin' like we the Pistons
Ferarri boy business
Baby, check out my engine
Switchin' gears quickly
Life is pole position
Your homeboy's a trick
He came home with a hickey
Since I'm in a 'enzo
Might as well roll a ickey
This bitch just text me
Baby, baby, ya miss me
You might also like
I'm talkin' loud, smokin' loud
Roll a half-a-mile joints
Stuffin' 'em like they Black & Mild's
I just rolled me five blunts
I'ma put you niggas on somethin'
I'm 
She want some, she worth some
I murk somethin', I'm worth somethin'
She's a monster, porn star, avatar, Amazon
I'm paid in full like Cam'ron
And healthy and handsome
Baby, you the one
You the bomb, Boston Marathon
I rap, act, and still trap too
That's triathalon
I got a magic one
I have you sprung
Bishop Don Juan
I got monkey nuts on all my guns
King Kong, son
Think I'm Cheech 'n' Chong
Fuckin' up my lungs
Smokin' with your mom
Addicted to me
Nicotine gum
Need to listen to me

Guwop, Guwop, Guwop
Guwop, Guwop
