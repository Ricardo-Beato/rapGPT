19 ContributorsAgainst the World Lyrics
Back at you
Right back at you

Drove around the block, drove a lot
Lookin' all around, don't see no cops
Whisper in your ears, a ghetto star
Sittin' on my lap inside of my car
Lookin' at my lips, take a taste
Taste yours too, rub your back
Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat
Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes
Close your legs, I start to sigh
Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes
Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like
Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head
Put the thought away, think of you instead
Hot outside, it's hot in here
Roll down the window, the breeze in your hair
Your earrings shake, you a baby doll
You say you want me but did you want them all?
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel
You might also like
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world? (Hell yeah the world)
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world? (Hell yeah the world)
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world? (Hell yeah the world)
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world? (Hell yeah the world)
(Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Whole wide world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Whole wide world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world)

Dame un beso, s'il vous plait
Or can you hold my hand, it's better that way
If we was on video, I'd press rewind
A nigga think about you all the time
Pigeon dropped a note, on top my head
RnB, pop, girls thoroughbred
Run around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...
Pick you up
Raise your cup, let love erupt
Vol-ca-no, natural disast'
Fall in love with me? Huh, well that's that ass
Wanna get you, inside my world
Process, straight, afro or curl
Stretch me out, phase me in
Forever you and me, let me see you grin
He fucked you, I'mma tap his chin
Make me feel special, I know that you can
Make me feel special like a prominent man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world? (Hell yeah the world)
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world? (Hell yeah the world)
Me and you honey go against the world
Against the world? (Hell yeah the world)
Me and you girl go against the world
Against the world? (Hell yeah the world)
(Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Whole wide world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Whole wide world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Whole wide world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Yeah the world
Whole wide world)1Embed
