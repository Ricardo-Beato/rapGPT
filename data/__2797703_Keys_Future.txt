4 ContributorsKeys Lyrics
I told you I know the keys
I know keys, yeah
Look around at the round table
I know keys
Win nigga!

I know keys
That's a thousand grams a year
I don't have to weigh it up or use a scale, huh!
Cause I know keys!
I just left Puerto Rico
With Ebony, Samantha and Alicia
Cause I know keys!
I got five different cars
Nigga I got five different broads
Cause I know keys!
They're like oh, my G!
Every time I'm showing off my pieces
Cause I know keys!

I'm a mother fucking genius
Shit, I was gonna be modest
But this bitch a nigga with looking just like a goddess
I can't help but to pull up in a brand new big body
I got cheese!
Versace in my closet and I'm dressed up, paparazzi
I pull up a hundred thousand
I can have a thousand tacos pull a right next to
I'm talkin' with the straight face, nigga ain't smiling
Riding round with the unit, remixed it and ballooned it!
Scale on top of that thing, you know we're done perfumed it
I had to take a five, I done charge a five for driving, nigga!
You're talking about the squares, I know how to get rid of em'
You might also like
I don't have to weigh it up or use a scale, huh!
Cause I know keys!
I just left Puerto Rico
With Ebony, Samantha and Alicia
Cause I know keys!
I got five different cars
Nigga I got five different broads
Cause I know keys!
They're like oh, my G!
Every time I'm showing off my pieces
Cause I know keys!

Oh yeah, that was a brand new single by your boy future
It's the morning man with the plan
It's OG Reeferer Chiefer
It's black Woodstock roll up, cut up, up
Drink up, sip up, chew up, lick it up
But don't throw up
Cause that ain't wassup
It's about  the experience, you digg
It's 4-20.5
Got Snoop on the phone line
Check it in for my man! Let's go!
What's happening, Snoop?
What up, Doggie Dog?
DJ esco snoop lion you know what it is
Black woodstock, right in your face, yahh manEmbed
