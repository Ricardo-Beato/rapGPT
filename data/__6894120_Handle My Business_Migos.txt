Fuck nigga done forgot about this shit, y'all niggas, you know
We can see y'all fly, we can see you niggas hatin'
Yeah, it ain't no secret
Hey

Handle my business, I'm grown (Woo)
I'm tryna make me a B 'fore I'm gone (Billion)
There's drugs in my chromosomes (There's drugs)
Yeah, we thugs, don't know right from wrong (Thugs)
(You know we don't know no better, know what I'm sayin'
Somebody gotta teach us somethin', whoo, whoo, whoo)
Boardin' a jet with a bad bitch that's wet (Jet)
Breakin' her back, and I gave her a check (Check)
Bottega flex, I got Marni on deck (Bottega)
Dolce Gabbana, lil' mama, oh yes (Dolce & Gabbana)
(Spеnd a little check, you know, a little somеthin', somethin', not too crazy, whoo, whoo, whoo)

We brought it back, like the 80's with crack
Nobody frontin', we takin' your pack (Take that)
We changed the game, nigga, keep it a stack (Gang)
Not takin' chains, if you play you get whacked (Whacked)
All facts, no cap (No cap)
We makin' millions, we known for that (Yessir)
Hate on my gang, we too grown for that
I keep the fire, not alone, or lackin' (Offset)
Nigga, ain't stoppin' this shit, I been poppin' my shit (Poppin')
Holdin' your leg, 'cause I'm holdin' my bitch (Hold on)
Holdin' my blick, I don't trust nobody (Nobody)
They playin' dirty, they know that I'm it (Dirty)
Suck on my dick, bitch, you know how to spit (Spit)
Hang with no cliques, I don't know who would switch (Nah)
Countin' these racks, I done sprained my wrist (Racks)
I taught you boys how to maintain your bitch (Hey)
We came from nothin', I thought they forgot (Forgot)
Runnin' from 12 with a zip in my crotch (12)
Go hit the lot
Pink's in my chain, yeah pinks in my watch (Pinks)
Balenci' frames, vintage supply (Vintage)
Taught 'em the way, they copied my fly (Copied)
Go to my page, I know that you spy (Spyin')
They say they ain't hatin', I know that's a lie (Cap)
Spinnin', we put a lil' bitch in the sky (Spin)
Winnin', my blessings, they come from the sky (Whoo)
I took a pic with a fan, she was shy (Shy)
Way that she lookin', she couldn't believe her eyes (Whoo)
Know I was chosen, I know I'm that guy (Guy)
We took it global, and ain't no denyin' (Global)
I’m staying focused and savin' my knot (Focused)
Ready to slide, if there's some beef, then my gang gon' fry it (Ah)

Now that I'm up, we can get off the mountains
I need help to count it (Go)
Call my accountant, this four hunnid racks, we just made that lil' shit outta town (Four packs)
Back to back 'Clarens and back to back Rolls (Ooh, ooh)
We had to go get this shit out the ground (Go get it)
Back to back tactical shit we done showed (Bah, activate tactical mode)
How many times I'ma tell you these niggas some hoes when they get exposed? (Yeah)

(Takeoff)
I keep the fire in the pocket of the jacket
They know I ain't gon' show it, but they know I'm packin' (Brr)
Stop all that talkin', we know that you actin' (Stop)
We havin' motion, and causin' a havoc
I heard she left with a bag, that's tragic
I can't blame the bitch, I'm blamin' her pappy (Pappy)
Look at my ice, bitch, I'm not your average (Ice)
Look at my life, bitch, I'm living lavish
We pick up that stick, you know we gon' blast it
Went on a mission, he knew he was crashin' (Crash)
Them red, blue, and whites, harass 'em (12)
I'm screamin', "Fuck 12" like it's cancer (Fuck 'em)
Took the game and hold it for ransom (Hold it)
Until they give me my answers (Give me my)
On why niggas ain't winnin' Grammy's (Why?)
And gettin' the check, we demand it (Why?)
Handle my business, I'm grown (Woo)
I'm tryna make me a B 'fore I'm gone (Billion)
