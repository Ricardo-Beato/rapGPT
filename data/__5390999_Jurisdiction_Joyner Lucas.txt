5 ContributorsJurisdiction Lyrics
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner

Uh, put the cause on the totem, put the balls on the boat
And hit 'em all with the motive
Joyner's all in the focus
And the blogs want to post a niggas songs and you notice
I'm a star, undervoted
I'm a dog, I'm a Doberman pinscher, you a pony
You a unicorn, Louis Vuitton, sneakers on woadie
Trying to be up on me and my niggas like you know me
You don't me
You just know what the people wanna tell ya
Talkin' on the low, but the speakers gon' kill ya
Sleepin' on my back with the TV on the ceilin'
Got Jeezy on, chillin' with the kiwi hard sippin'
E'erybody wanna live like Tony Montana
Sniffin' out the coke with the homie, don-da-da
Drug dealin', bang bang, with the phony bandanna
'Til the homies run right up in your cozy mañana
That's real
Fuck a talk
Funny how a funny nigga come across
Funny how the money make a sucker talk
When it feel good like a nigga took the rubber off
I see both sides like tug-a-war
Joyner's on fire, close the oven door
Beat the pussy up like a drummer boy
Thought you ran the city, what the fuck you niggas runnin' for?
Fuck the law
Tell the politician I'm a terrorist
And tell the government that I'm a colored kid
Tryna make a penny off of half a G
And that'll be the day you catch me workin' at a god damn Applebee's
Nigga, don't be dappin' me
'Cause we ain't got shit to talk about unless you talkin' 'bout a salary
And rappers wanna talk about battle me
But they can suck my dick with a mouth full of cavities
Oh, you in trouble
And I love it how they hate you
But they actin' like they love you
Then they kiss you, then they hug you
Make a screwed face at you
Middle finger saying "Fuck you, nigga"
That's just motivation
I ain't hatin' like a sucker
But I treat you like a slugger
Uppercut you 'til you crumble
Have you singin' like Usher
You a dish to my supper
Motherfuck a nigga, uh
You might also like
Never ever have I ever
Ever seen another motherfucker fuck her
Fuck her better, better than him
If I ever did
Then I was never ever on this planet
But I plan to dead him and forget him
If I ever seen another
'Nother different mother fucker
On a level of a level one
Level headed rapper
That be rappin' circles
'Round the circles that you rappers burnin'
Burnin' rappers like I'm burnin'
Burnin' bridges with the niggas
That be burnin' bitches
On a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction

I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
The judge told me I don't listen
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Run and tell the competition
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
I said, I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
The cops told me I don't listen
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Run and tell the competition
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Jurisdiction
Regarded as mercilessly destructive and unstoppable
Something that demands blind devotion
Or sacrifice
What are you willing to sacrifice?
To censor the word is ground
When you can, it's comparable
To mean something more than
Jurisdiction

I see a bunch of sentimental niggas
In the ghetto while I’m sittin’
On a Level while I’m spittin’
Instrumental  went on trippin’
Independent Independent
On the feelin or the mission
I go heaven it hadn’t been an aberration
I ain’t selling crack I did it
But my other  was tripping
And my brother has some bitches
I be fucking I was different
And I know it
You was on my Jurisdicton
And I saw it
You ain’t know what I’d had been through
I don’t hate ‘em make no friends
And I don’t care about potential
I don’t care to make it simple
Take advantage of your mental
I’m a idol
You just wanna infiltrate me
You the smartest
Little kids talkin’ cray
Sayin’ they just wann’ be like Tony Montana
Sniffin' out the coke with the homies, don-da-da
Drug dealin', bang bang, with the phony bandanna
'Til the homies run right up in your cozy mañana
That's real
Tough or not
Funny how a funny nigga talk a lot
Funny how the money make a sucker pop
‘Cause it feel good like a nigga took a puff of rock
But I can give a damn if he tough or not
Joyner’s on fire like the oven’s hot
Beat the pussy up like a Juggernaut
Say you run the city what the fuck you niggas talking ‘bout
Fuck the law
Tell the government that I’m a terrorist
And tell the president that I’m a colored kid
Tryna make a penny of a half a G
And that'll be the day you catch me workin' at a god damn Applebee's
Nigga, don’t be dappin’ me
‘Cause we ain’t got shit to talk about
What you talking ‘bout dangerous
Them rappers wanna be a bunch a gangsters
But they can suck my dick with a mouth full of braces
Oh you in trouble
Never ever have I ever
Ever seen another motherfucker fuck her
Fuck her better, better than him
If I ever did
Then I was never ever on this planet
But I plan to dead him and forget him
If I ever seen another
'Nother different mother fucker
On a level of a level one
Level headed rapper
That be rappin' circles
'Round the circles that you rappers burnin'
Burnin' rappers like I'm burnin'
Burnin' bridges with the niggas
That be burnin' bitches
On a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction (jurisdiction)
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction

I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
The judge told me I don't listen
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Run and tell the competition
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
I said, I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
I'm on a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
The cops told me I don't listen
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Run and tell the competition
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdictionEmbed
