18 ContributorsHawk Jones Lyrics

My flow like Hawk Jones
The little bitty one
Hit me on my iPhone
You can text me when I'm done
I'm sicker than your grandparents honey
I'm sicker than that bitch at the end of Ben Button
Your mixtapes mean nothing
I put out albums in a week
Eat these other rappers rhymes
That is why my breath stink
You get fucked like nymphos
These clothes make niggas roll up their windows
These Frito banditos
Cause they're like chips
Cause they talk shit see me then dip
These niggas round here
They don't let your tongue slip
Send you black and blue
Like you an African crip
My green like a weird watermelon
No seeds
And my green like a weird watermelon
All leaves
My green don't fit in my white skinny jeans
Cause I move anywhere
So I guess I'm the queen
You might also like
Yes, yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes, yes Andre show 'em how it's done

Whoever wanna climb this beanstalk is gonna find me
No, I'm not a giant, but my name is An-dree
Oops, I meant Andree
Add an extra “e” and the accent mark
Yes it’s Dree, not Dreeeeee
He's so confused cause he thought I was a boy
Well, I got two Mounds but no Almond Joy
And all these fools wanna taste my cream
Infatuation thick like a slab of good brie
Infatuation real all they think of is me
Yes all these fucking Charlies got a lactose disease
But they not intolerant, they daydream more than moderate
It's just not a meal until you sprinkle Parmesan on it
It's just not a get until you give all you got on it
It's just not a cock until you pumpin' all of your heart in it
Look at him staring at my lips
Ain't they thicker than a pair of African hips
I thought we was friends, but he think we gon' kiss
Here he comes leaning in, he swing, he miss
How's it feel to taste a mouthful of air yes
How's it feel to kiss me knowing I am not there
Boy I need a censor, boy you need a mentor
These boys need to be lead like they're two pencils
Yes I'm a black nerd, it's that simply
Call me poindexter or the black Ed Grimly
Girl attitude stay stank like kimchi
But she ain't Korean and her boy ain't friendly
Turn your girls that are friends to fuck buddies
Keep 'em on the wire, that's why I cuddy
And every girl that I'm friends with wants to fuck
That's why she waits till I'm drunk, then she runs amok
Guess boy my name's an aphrodisiac
Yes boy at the hotel's where I leave 'em at
I am Animaniac cause I'm so wacko
Better warn a brother when you see a chick act ho
And even if she's so Angel that she's on Bones
No girl is so fly to fuck with Hawk Jones

Yes, yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes yes I'm so Hawk Jones
So why don't these motherfuckers just leave me aloneEmbed
