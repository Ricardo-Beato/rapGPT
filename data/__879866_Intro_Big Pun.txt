17 ContributorsIntro Lyrics

Bam, Spider-Man go down
Bam, Daredevil go down
All them niggas is going down
Punisher be taking they ass out

X-Men take out the Punisher

X-Man baby stuff, homes
All their costumes
And powers ain't shit
Punisher the real dope, homie

Word, I seen a seven-foot-tall
White Terminator nigga...
With twenty guns on my roof
Just the other day

Punisher be takin' out
All your stupid heroes
He be sayin'
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Take out that nigga!
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!You might also like2Embed
