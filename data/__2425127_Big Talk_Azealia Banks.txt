20 ContributorsBig Talk Lyrics
(M-M-M-M)
Y'all know y'all seen that Playboy cover
Bring your sexy ass in here, uh
All I know is that big talk (All I know is that big talk), uh (M-M-M-M)
All I know is that big talk (All I know is that big talk), uh
All I know is that big talk (All I know is that big talk), Banks!
(Maybach Music)

All I know is that big talk, gold rings, got gold buttons
Goin' up and down my sheep skin, we the wolf pack and it's a cold summer
Never deep, I keep one gunna, say her name, I might run up on ya
Send that text, "I wanna touch ya girl", if they don't fuck with us well it's fuck the world (Well it's fuck the world)
Ice box for my princess, got a double M on that pendant
And back in I'm bout to spend that, got a big bag and I been rich
We make love and she talk slick, G-Wagon, she a boss bitch
Major League in that boy pitch, Major League in that boy pitch
Mussolini when I'm out in Rome, Cleopatra, she dipped in gold
Pussy shot and she centerfold, Bel-Air and my mind blown
Ros√© and I'm checkin' out like Caesar did, slide down my sword
She a blasphemy 'cause she love The God, pray you never let 'em come crucify the boy (Crucify the boy, crucify the boy, crucify the boy...)

Ahhhh
Mmhm-hmm
Uh
Uh, uh (M-M-M-M)

Black magic, David Blaine flow, color money like a rainbow
Azealia Banks keep the bank rolls, shine like illuminated Angels
Bad bitch, I'm bodacious, Black power but I'm no racist
Ballin' I don't need no agent, in the Maybach feelin' so spacious
Focused on another hundred thou, goin' up another level now
Nigga's wildin', better settle down, got the Rollie diamonds in the bezel now
Take notes, get your pen and pencil, with Ricky Ross, we quintessential
Ain't nothing here incidental, we poppin' off on instrumentals
Slide off in the Rolls Royce, I'm slayin' bitches in a grey mink
You can slide on it like escapades, this ice on me like a skating rink (Woo!)
Big talk, big bank, pussy wetter than the Great Lakes
And for this life, I'ma give thanks and pray they never gon' burn a witch at the stake

All I know is that big talk (All I know is that big talk), uh, uh
All I know is that big talk (All I know is that big talk), uh
This conversation is rich talk, niggas, uh
All I know is that big talk, uh9Embed
