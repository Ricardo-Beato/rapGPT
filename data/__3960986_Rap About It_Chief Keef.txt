7 ContributorsRap About It Lyrics
Zaytoven
ZayTiggy, ayy
What's goin' on, man?
ZayTiggy, wah'gwan?
ZayTiggy, wah'gwan?
What's goin' on?

Nigga, sit your ass down (Nigga, sit your ass down)
Man, what is you? A class clown? (You a class clown?)
I'm smoking out the pound right now (Out the motherfuckin' pound)
I'm on the mic right now like
Man, what the fuck I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about? Hey
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about?

The money, I'ma rap 'bout that
I know niggas get the money and make it all stretch
The lavish lifestyle, I'm gon' preach 'bout that
'Cause I done been up in the streets, I did it already
This bitch say she want some Tiffany's
I told her, "You want you a Christmas tree"
Told that ho I'ma rap about that
She like, "I know you ain't kidding with me"
Me and my lil' niggas hot sauce
They give me something to rap 'bout
They gon' come with stock clip
They gon' fuck around, put the mop on
Lil' bitch calling my phone
Told that bitch that I'm not home
Told that bitch I'ma rap 'bout that
I can't leave it alone
Come through S-Apollo, you can get a hollow
I just hit the lotto, I'm Otto with the auto
You might also like
Nigga, sit your ass down (Nigga, sit your ass down)
Man, what is you? A class clown? (You a class clown?)
I'm smoking out the pound right now (Out the motherfuckin' pound)
I'm on the mic right now like
Man, what the fuck I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about? Hey
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about?

These bitches, I should rap about that
She tried to take my money, I should slap her 'bout that
She say these niggas dummies, I know nothing 'bout that
I come from the slums, bitch, we rumbled 'bout that
Back to rapping 'bout the money, you get crumbled 'bout that
Wrap you like a funnel, you get tunneled 'bout that
I gave that bitch a hundred, bitch, be humble bout that
She like, "I know sugar daddies," I don't give a fuck about that
She like, "So', you real, and I love you 'bout that"
You so damn crazy, I'm gon' fuck you 'bout that
"You ain't nothing like these clowns, I'ma suck you 'bout that"
Nigga, sit your ass down, you ain't nothing like that
Nigga, sit your ass down
Man, what is you? A class clown?
I'm smoking out the pound right now
I'm on the mic right now like
Man, what the fuck I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about? Hey
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
What I'm finna rap about?
Man, what I'm finna rap about?Embed
