White girl, white girl, shy girl, shy girl
White girl, white girl, night girl, night girl

I’m from East Atlanta where they cutting off fangas
Got a white girlfriend she be acting a anus
She can get you knocked out with a point of a finger
And she don’t talk to strangers, she got red tangas
Got coke in the strainer and a lawyer retainer
So you hard so you soft, she got all kinds of angles
And this California kush it got me talking like I'm Tony (Montana)
Playing with my money then I’m calling my attorney
And them people can’t believe that Gucci man got jungle fever
And I think I love this girl because her price is hella cheaper
And like lu said it’s better to loose a love than love a leaver
Running around town with them choppers about the same size as Justin Bieber

I fell in love with that white girl (white girl)
I love them pretty little white white girls (white girls)
I’m in the spot full of white girls (white girls)
I’m in the drop with the white girl (white girl)
I fell in love with the white girl (white girl)
It was love at first sight girl (sight girl)
I’m in the club full of white girls (white girls)
I’ll be your boyfriend for the night girl (night girl)

Mexican, Jose, Virgina? You don’t say
Chopper bullets, rotate
Hundred round AK
Young nigga thug b!tching on color back
Pocket full of money and all I stack is dollar signs
White girl crazy, wrist done got lazy
Never been a racist, a white girl pay me
My credit card black new b!tch brown skin
Duffle bag full of that green shit
Ain’t nothing like my white friend
White benz, white on white
Rolling on my grown man
30 corners in that b!tch narrow with them thangs
I love that white girl, and I beat her like a mushay
Ridgecrest Apartment got you screaming like the OJ

I fell in love with that white girl (white girl)
I love them pretty little white white girls (white girls)
I’m in the spot full of white girls (white girls)
I’m in the drop with the white girl (white girl)
I fell in love with the white girl (white girl)
It was love at first sight girl (sight girl)
I’m in the club full of white girls (white girls)
I’ll be your boyfriend for the night girl (night girl)
Creep out through the day, creature of the night
Let her sit on your face, she’ll get you high as a kite
She knows just what you like, I know just what you need
If them white girls you like, bet I got one of your type
Have a blunt for the day, brunette for the night
She got my pockets eight I bring her out in the light
I got the crowd I got them
I got them vans (its Gucci)
I got her ticked off in my van
She fuck with me cause I’m the man
I’m passing kush out to my fans
And I don’t think you understand
She got me folding other brands

I fell in love with that white girl (white girl)
I love them pretty little white white girls (white girls)
I’m in the spot full of white girls (white girls)
I’m in the drop with the white girl (white girl)
I fell in love with the white girl (white girl)
It was love at first sight girl (sight girl)
I’m in the club full of white girls (white girls)
I’ll be your boyfriend for the night girl (night girl)4Embed
