14 ContributorsB.D.K. Lyrics
Ain't no half-stepping
Bout to bring it to you
Bout to give it to you
Yo Talib Kweli in the place to be
You now rocking with the best BK MC
This is how we put it down O four
Kweli the great I be the first out this gate
I get cake stop that you making a mistake
I gives a fuck if the label can't get straight
I get paid with this mixtape like I flip weight
Yo, stay away from those state paid vacations
Nigga raw like Kane when he played Jason
From the generation of crack babies and aids patients
I go hard you niggas soft like Clay Aiken
Plus you only hard when the camera on
Soft like the foundation you standing on rhyme marathon
Sort of like when Diddy ran the city
Fuck with us and guns pop out like Janet's titty
Yo, I got niggas ready for the main event
That's why I'm still around and all those corny niggas came and went
Top shotter rocking with Trotter and got the Game on deck
Stroll through any hood and get the same respect

Comptons Kool G Rap, black All Stars
10 khakis and a red Blue Jay hat
I’m lowridin' on 100 spoke daytons
Nigga with an attitude like Nas buying jewelry from Jacob
I’m don’t play that mixtape shit
Say my name and I buck 50 ya face like Miami Haitian
I’m gangsta homie, check my verse
I’m lyrically Big Daddy Kane in Converse
And niggas think we just Boys N The Hood
And the city of angels got poisoned by Suge
I take the drama, roll it up in a swisher
Let Kweli hit it then lower the switches
I’m 3 wheelin’, through the Wilshire district
Thinking how Big and Pac both died by pistols
L.A. Times called it the Death Row conspiracy
Run up on my 6-4, i’ll take out ya misery
You might also like
Straight out the frying pan into the game
If yall attention is paid no need to mention the name
I breathe the fire that can fire back drenching your brain
Velvet rope or gold chain it's all a lynching the same
You in tuned to a world of pain
It hurt like new shoes with nothing to lose
The world to gain
To yall fools to brainiacs high iqs
If you feel it ain't banging than it's not my music
Can't stagnate the haters can't stop my movement
Play this at high volume and get you shocked off stupid
Ya kiddin me, here come a taste of escapism
Tell your people there will be something left to take with em
You see me lifting mics I be steady weightlifting
I'm zoning out silhouettes get to shapeshifting
Watch me force perpetrating like they ain't slippin
Kwa we about to hit em up catch another victim

Yea check this out
Let me tell yall niggas something about shit
Cuz motherfuckers try and do it to you everyday
Try and shit on you right?
Check this out
Don't shake the shit off
Cuz when you shake the shit off
You never know where the shit is going to land
Could land on your girl could land in your food could land on your car
Man, let the shit slide off you homey and hit the ground
Cuz when you shake it off you have no idea where it lands
Hehe a little public service announcement
From your boy X to the motherfucking Z
The left coast is the best coast, keep going yall
The best of Talib turn your fucking radio up1Embed
