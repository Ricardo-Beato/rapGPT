20 ContributorsRacist Lyrics
(Zaytoven)

I put big-ass rims on my car
Money long, this shit going too far
I pulled twenty bad bitches riding in my car
I told them bitches, "Bitch, I'm freaking you tomorrow"
Police pulled me over, they thought I was racing
I told 'em, "My car ain't with the damn pacing"
Got my guns from Indiana, think they with the Pacers
I only like green, she like, "Boy, you racist"

Girl, I got money all in my fucking pocket
I don't like talking, you can leave if you ain't fucking
I ain't want to fuck you anyway, bitch, you musty
Baby girl, you dusty, but my car do all the dusting
Riding in that Beamer, Bieber, bitch, Justin
I'm screaming obscenities, bitch, I'm cussing
She acting like a bee for the weed, bitch be buzzing
I told her 'bout my money, she can go and meet my cousin
Rest in peace Blood, if he was here, he would be mugging
My car super bad, I done named it McLovin
I told her, "I'ma leave my pants on while we fucking"
I only want to fuck you for ten minutes, then I'm nutting, I'm nothing
You might also like
I put big-ass rims on my car
Money long, this shit going too far
I pulled twenty bad bitches riding in my car
I told them bitches, "Bitch, I'm freaking you tomorrow"
Police pulled me over, they thought I was racing
I told 'em, "My car ain't with the damn pacing"
Got my guns from Indiana, think they with the Pacers
I only like green, she like, "Boy, you racist"

I'm sipping red, I paid six hundred for the pint
Eight hundred dollar Margielas, fuck your Mikes
Bitch buggin', told me thousand dollars for the night
I say, "I'm Chief Sosa, I ain't never paid in my life"
Blowing smoke in the police face, bitch, I know my rights
I don't give no fuck, you can tell how I'm running lights
Don't leap if you a frog, fuck nigga, get hit with pipe
I don't like the 'Woods that much, I'm rolling big-ass whites
That's big-ass joints, now you know it, fuck nigga, pipe down
I'm so turnt up, can't even put my pipe down
I'm so bossed up, think I live up in the White House
When you see me, salute me, or it's fucking lights out

I put big-ass rims on my car
Money long, this shit going too far
I pulled twenty bad bitches riding in my car
I told them bitches, "Bitch, I'm freaking you tomorrow"
Police pulled me over, they thought I was racing
I told 'em, "My car ain't with the damn pacing"
Got my guns from Indiana, think they with the Pacers
I only like green, she like, "Boy, you racist"
I told that bitch she can't touch my dreads
I'm smoking Tooka, counting on the deads
She say I'm tweaking, I ain't even take my meds
Tatted like amigos, bitch, my skin filled with lead
Nigga talking down, fill him up with lead
I'm flexing so hard, I should buy a watch for my leg
Since he sending messages, he get hit in the legs
I'm friends with UPS and FedEx
I'm full, I ain't even eat my eggs
I got an Uzi with a cooling kit and kick
I start to pour it out, it's pouring out the fifties

I put big-ass rims on my car
Money long, this shit going too far
I pulled twenty bad bitches riding in my car
I told them bitches, "Bitch, I'm freaking you tomorrow"
Police pulled me over, they thought I was racing
I told 'em, "My car ain't with the damn pacing"
Got my guns from Indiana, think they with the Pacers
I only like green, she like, "Boy, you racist"
