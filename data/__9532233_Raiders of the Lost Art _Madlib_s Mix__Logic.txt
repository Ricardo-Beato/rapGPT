6 ContributorsRaiders of the Lost Art (Madlib’s Mix) Lyrics
The first rule is we don't talk about...
The first...
Ayo

Beef with me and kill yourself, Bruce Willis Looper
Always stay with two black nines like Mr. Cooper
That's a throwback reference (First rule)
Nowadays I'm working on nothing else but self-acceptance
Ayo, the world tainted, people try but can't explain it
Back when I was living single, yeah, I stayed with bitches like Khadijah
Sniping emcees within my leisure
My life was like a Tarantino feature
Jack the Ripper meets Jack Reachеr
Close encounters of thе word con
Spielberg shit, the world's mine (Bitch ass motherfucker)
Just a youngin almost famous, living dangerous
Thinking deep like a suture
Sometimes I reminisce but bring it back to the future (What)
Raiders of the Lost, yo (Ayo, fuck you bitch ass motherfucker)

Ayy, I'm the big daddy, smacking you up like Gilmore's caddy
Kyle in the cut making beats, rolling a fatty
We the boys in the hood tryna make it in time
Yeah, the concept is easy, hard part is the rhyme
Grip the gat and blast away, the modern-day Cast Away
Everybody th-(Ayo, fuck you bitch ass)
Everybody think they know it all but it's just all pretend
'Cause at the end of the day we all children of men
And man has his flaws, always running their jaws
A hundred miles and running, come on and catch me if you can
Fuck the radio, we do this shit for the fans
Flow sicker than Covid, got 'em throwing up their hands
Black and white like a reservoir dog
Twitch money, I'm the pog
Your shit flawed, ripping through the city of God
When it comes to my pinky ring, it's vintage 80's
I'm the lord of the bling, I can't fuck with you peasants so it's more for the king
Industry too fake, we too real, they don't trust us (First rule)
We see through y'all like Ghostbusters
Got my deal and I moved to LA, that's the west side story
Logic known for staying positive like dads on Maury
A curly headed kid who finally met the world quarry
Everything you talkin' 'bout is straight irrelevant
I'm Korben Dallas, you Ruby Rhod in the Fifth Element
I once was a diamond in the rough
We call this right here the shining, king of rhyming
Me and my homies, yeah, we all good fellas
Living in mansions, we used to be hood dwellers
(First rule, don't talk about...)
Raiders of the Lost Art
Mulholland Drive on a dark night
Ready for eternal sunshine bright
