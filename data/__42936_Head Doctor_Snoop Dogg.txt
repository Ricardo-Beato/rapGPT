4 ContributorsHead Doctor LyricsChorus:
You remind me of somebody
I used to know, I used to know
Snoop ***talkin w/ chorus***
Ya'll ain't even gonna believe this shit man
Remember that bitch I had
That little light skined bitch
Yea this bitch was a trip
You know how she loved to sucked a niggas dick
Every once in a while this bitch got to the point to
Where she thought she was gonna be getting
Some here and there
I told her I wasn't tryin to have that
And the bitch wipped out
So check this out
Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg
I'm at home, layin low
Everything is everything waitin on my hoe
I know its hard to imagne that a nigga on my status
Had a night like tonight look here I'm glad
Came to an end
My girlfriend slid into the bedroom with a woman
Come in, is what she said closed the door and jumped in the bed
Baby would of gave a nigga head insted of flippin and trippin
I run along with the PG, hm
And that's on DP
I mean what could I say, what could I do
Anything I say and do is a catch 22
And I knew I had a clue
Of some type of suspion
Tuesday night when I see you up at peanuts fishin'
I wasn't really trippin
At first I wasn't gonna go dippin
Then I said damn look at all these bitches
I went inside couldn't believe my eyes
Snatch up four fly bitches, time to ride
Tell by the earl pull the Bently in front
Hit me with a G thang, fuck a blunt
Ridin at the highway, thangs is going my way
Tell the bitches that we be goin to my place
Fellin like Teddy Pendagrass on the freeway
Get my dick knocked off, in a G way
Yea they know the program is set
And lovin each other and lovin my dick
It's a trip but I don't see nothin wrong with it
So you can work your thang which is Snoop
And I'ma sip this drank, thank and recoop
Cuz when you close the bar down
You know what {you know what}
Baby you a star know

I can't fuck no head doctor
I don't give a fuck even if the bitch is proper
She might be cute, she might be thick
But she will get G'd if she don't suck dick
Verse Two: Swoop G
Man I wanted to fly
When it come to what these women say
You know I'm the coldest
Cuz I spit that shit you niggas thank
Like proper, pimpin', prevence for preformances
I have my baddest bitch go get my grip
Go walk the strips, her ten toes touch the payment for mine
You know the time, cuz when it's time to make the payment  of mine
My bitch grind, make that G's stack come back and gimme that
All of that proper amount yea, my full count
And now she wants to have sex with me
I told her please sell my piece make my portion a fee
And I'm put you in position for victory
As long as you follow directions carefully
So I flossed her for a month, nephew you know whats up
I keep a bad broad servin that raw and uncut
So I send her up in peanuts for the trickin
She ran into this nigga and some bitches
Who talkin bout he gone pay in a real way
No more be said, break off the big heads
And you can get that, hit that, and split that
Boss up muthafucka and you can pimp that
