12 ContributorsTrue Loyalty Lyrics
Unh, yeah..I like the way this feel right here
Yo...turn me up in the head phones just a lil' bit
Yeah..

There ain't shit in this world deeper than loyalty and love
Except loyalty and love between thugs
For you I pull up in the whip and spray the whole strip
For you, I walk up close and lay a nigga's kid
For you, there ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'm a Thug, this the way I show my love for you
Nigga for you, I get the coke, I'ma turn it into cash
For you, if we go broke, we gon' rob a nigga ass
For you, if we get knocked, I'ma have to take the weight
Cause with a record like yours, doawg, you ain't staying upstate
Nigga for you, I kill a whole goddamn crew (Why?)
Cause I know you'd do the same thing too
I ride for you, you ride for me, my enemies your enemies
How could you not love a thug like me?

Would you ride for me?
You ain't even got to ask
Would you die for me?
Nigga, they blast you, they blast me
Would you cry for me?
Shit, when I die don't cry for me
Just keep repping Southside for me
Would you ride for me?
You ain't even got to ask
Would you die for me?
Nigga, they blast you, they blast me
Would you cry for me?
Shit, when I die don't cry for me
Just keep repping Southside for me
You might also like
Nigga, I'm the stem, you the crack
I'm the clip, you the gat
I'm the Glock, you the mac
I'm the artist, you the trap
I'm a pen, you the pad
I'm the Dutch, you the bag
I'm the knife, you the stab
I'm the driver, you the Jag
I'm the ice, you the bezel
I'm grimy, you ghetto
I'm the bow, you the arrow
I'm the shell, you the barrel
I'm a pimp, you a player
I'm dope, you the hustler
I'm a nine, quiet me down, you the muffler

Would you ride for me?
You ain't even got to ask
Would you die for me?
Nigga, they blast you, they blast me
Would you cry for me?
Shit, when I die don't cry for me
Just keep repping Southside for me
Would you ride for me?
You ain't even got to ask
Would you die for me?
Nigga, they blast you, they blast me
Would you cry for me?
Shit, when I die don't cry for me
Just keep repping Southside for me
You can catch me in public housing with bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains bundled up to ski
Since time is money I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You see the ice, you know it's top notch
And when it comes to dice I'm seeing shorty to the shot box
Banks stop, guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind I wear the same shit tomorrow
When you grind it's Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hot sixteen
Well, my flow's like a hoe that's sixteen
I ran through niggas, dismantled niggas
They mad 'cause they see me in Cancun, bitches
But I'm ghetto, straight from the hood, my nigga
If there's no toothbrush I'ma use my finger
I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still living like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice I'm called Jack Frost, man
And while we sipping on Cris' you sipping backwash, man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat - what?1Embed
