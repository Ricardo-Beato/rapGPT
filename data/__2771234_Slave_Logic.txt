Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-ey-oh
Hey-oh, hey, that hey-oh, hey-oh, hey
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)
Hey-oh (Alright)
Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey (Alright, let's go)
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)

East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this

Tell me what you know about forty days, forty nights
No lights, all for this
Tell me what you know about sleeping outside
No ride in the wintertime, all for this
Tell me what you know about commas in the bank
Lookin' in the mirror, yeah, I did all of this
Tell me what you know about family never there
But swear they deserve all of this
Tell me what you know about people tryna test you
Don't wanna get involved with this
X you out, you get solved with this
Everybody gotta evolve with this
Like bitch I bet I be at the place I said I'd be
Legendary like No I.D
You know I be duckin' every ho I see
Cause I'm out of this world, and I know I be like...
You might also like
East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this

Living as a black man, in the skin of the white man
Everybody wanna fight man, and I put it on my right hand
Goddamn, it's all for this
I just wanna make the world a better place
Fuck race and the shade in my face
Looking for the sun but the shade in my face
Best in my field, I'm a slave to the race
Black motherfucker, white motherfucker
I don't give a damn what you is, can you write motherfucker?
Said I couldn't do it, said I wouldn't do it
I just made a million in a month, aight motherfucker?
I did everything I said I'd ever do and to you I still ain't shit?
Aight motherfucker
Runnin' around the world yelling P-L-P
But as a last resort, we gon' fight motherfucker like

East side, west side, we ride, we die all for this
Oh my, my, I know why I can't fall for this
All my life I tried, I cried, got pride in this
All my life I'd hide, I stayed inside for this
Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-ey-oh
Hey-oh, hey, that hey-oh, hey-oh, hey
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Let's go)
Hey-oh (Alright)40Embed
