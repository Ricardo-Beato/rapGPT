6 ContributorsThe Crown Lyrics
Suicide doors, smoke grey Phantom
Fuckinâ€™ these whores, bitches gettin' at him
Rockin' this ice, lovin' my life
These niggas get mad, they don't wanna fight
'Bout to take a flight
And when I touch down it be ten thousand cash and the paper bag's brown
Ball with no budget, L.V.s on the luggage
Fall down to my knees, God, please keep it comin'
First-class flight, lookin' at the clouds
Hopin' that my niggas up in Heaven lookin' down
Hopin' what I'm doin' truly make my mama proud
'Cause for a very long time, I was the reason for her frowns
Chrome Alpinas, high school senior
I was never one of those, I sold zones out the Regal
Nigga had a vision
Then I made a decision
Then I gave a commitment
Then it put me in position
