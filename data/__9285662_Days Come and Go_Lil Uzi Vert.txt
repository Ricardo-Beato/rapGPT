They love me, then they hate me like I'm wakin’ God up
I treat that girl so good, I should charge up (Lotta cash)
I'm the one that act like, like her father
But I don't even know nowadays where my father
Sometimes I wanna call him, then sometimes don’t bother
If you was me, you would be weird too
I hang with killers and the robbers, yeah (Woah)
Insecurities make me wish I was taller (Yeah)
I backed down on the opportunity, I'm a staller
Insecurities every night while I'm in starlust
My girl fuck with a couple rappers, but I'm rawer
Insecurities always make me wan' dog her (Insecurities)
Insecurities ain't real, I'm just a narcissist
I'm from Philly, why I talk like this (A lot like this)
I’m from the gritty, why I walk like this (Yeah)
I made a milli’, then I taught my bitch
I know it's a couple niggas that stalk my bitch
But I would too if that was not my chick
I don’t know why I am so lost, like
I got brain damage every time I think about the bag
I got brain damage, but they overlook 'cause I got cash
Every time I get a check, everybody just got they hand out
But when I was broke, nobody really had they hand out

Days come and go (Days come and go)
But my love gon' stay
Stay on the road (Stay on the road)
So my money straight (My money straight)
Days come and go (Days come and go)
But my love gon' stay
Stay on the road (Stay on the road)
So my money straight (My money straight)

Uh, oh, you ’bout that? Uh, uh, you 'bout that?
Took them medications, uh, then reply back
Yeah, I know that you want me, girl, don't lie back
I've been so stressed out, rub my hair while I lie back, yeah

I need somebody just to vent to like the AC (AC)
If you knew what I went through, you know my life brazy (Brazy)
Took a trip, but that's when OG went to AC (Yeah)
We played baccarat all night, only made eighty, yeah
Got his personal number, but I never called JAY-Z, yeah
Every time he get paid, you know he pay me, yeah
You get it
I'm on top of the game like a fitted
And we don't text with emojis, only digits (Only digits)
Do you know what it mean? It had residuals (Oh)
I'm just talkin' to you, baby, I ain't flexin', though (Oh)
I'm just tryna really learn and get the best of you (Oh)
I let you know stuff about me that my ex don't know (Yeah)
I did stuff I'd never do to make sure the sex was gold
I remember I fell off, they wasn't there, but now my section full
And now my mansion got a closet big as investor view, I'm next to you
I ain't done, hold on, no, I ain't done
Put me in a crazy home, would've rather been twenty-three and one
And I don't wan' say they fucked me over, but I went down to fifth place
Had to climb my way back up just to be that one gun
I got too much on my mind, I got too much on my plate
I spent two hundred thousand on Desto funeral, that's an estate
I don't know why they be mad at me 'cause I'm expressin' my ways
I don't know why I cry sometimes, maybe I'm blessed with no fate
I ain't had nothin' left in my crate, I ain't even know what to say
But I always bounce back like orange rubber on that woodgrain
And some people say I'm insane, the other ones say I'm lame (Yeah)
But the only thing I know, I'm always gon' remain the same
Days come and go (Days come and go)
But my love gon' stay
Stay on the road (Stay on the road)
So my money straight (My money straight)
Days come and go (Days come and go)
But my love gon' stay
Stay on the road (Stay on the road)
So my money straight (My money straight)

Uh, oh, you 'bout that? Uh, uh, you 'bout that?
Took them medications, uh, then reply back
Yeah, I know that you want me, girl, don't lie back
I've been so stressed out, rub my hair while I lie back, yeah1Embed
