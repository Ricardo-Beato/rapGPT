Yeah, ayy, Jerm, Jerm
Yeah, ah! Ah!

Ah, I'm the muh'fuckin' greatest, y'all don't know that yet
I don't need your money, you can hold that check
At the crib in some Polo sweats
I don't need a ho, that's what the hoes don't get, woah (Woo)
I'm on my worst behavior (Woo)
Bad side piece with the pertinent flavor (Woo)
Muh'fuckers never loved us
Comin' for your money, muh'fucker don't trust us (Nah)
Uh, you ain't shit
Bought a brand new crib, yeah, I move that brick (Okay)
I don't want nothin' with your doo-doo clique (Okay)
Treat her like a dog how I do that bitch, uh
Done doin' promo (Promo)
And it's still motherfuckin' Most Dope (Most Dope)
Made a couple million off a brand
Muh'fucker, we ain't even got a logo, uh
Bitch, you better have my money (Must be feelin' myself)
I don't see anybody but me (Plan on killin' myself)
Keepin' shit too real (Keepin' shit too real)
See a muh'fucker like me gettin' money (How does it feel?)
Already been but I'm back for more
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Don't sleep!
You might also like
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Look bitch, don’t try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Bitch I don't speak French, look bitch, don't try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac (Oh, hello Q)
Yeah, yeah, said, said

I'm a maniac, crazy, act insane
Think I might need a cage in fact
Chain reactions happen when I make a pact
A psycho, God made me that
'Cause I fade to black, I gets down like a plane attack
You muh'fuckers just made me laugh
Ha ha, God damnit, this ain’t a drill, do not panic
Let me see how loud you scream (Argh!)
I'm off the map, muh'fuckas start lookin'
But they're never gonna see where I be
She only speak French
Said "Bitch look, don't try and speak around me"
And I don't sleep at all
If you on that bullshit, I ain't gonna be involved
Shit, shit, shit
I could make a million puttin' my lyrics on a tee (Woah)
Fearless, Jet Li, fourth quarter, Gretzky
Take your bitch, Joe Pesci, don't test me
Don't flex if you ain't got shit on me
And, you ain't got shit on me, come get it
(Come get it, come, come get it, come, come)
Jar full of fresh white snow, bag full of unleaded
I don't get enough credit (Get enough credit, woah)
Don't sleep!
M-M-M-M-M-M
They done fucked up, huh?
The biggest bezzle, huh?
The don, Ricky Farrakhan, huh?
M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music

My weed burnin', my chain glitter
He's self made, Mac Miller my real nigga
Fuck who don't like it, bitch, come see me
Fuck who don't like it, hitta, hitta, hitta
G-G-G-Gettin' money so complicated, I'm the shit, I'm constipated
Yo baby mama, straight G, let me use the crib to mail all the weed
California, Atlanta, white girl in a black Phantom
My top down, mid-December, ride with a big black fat nigga
Krispy Kreme then it's chicken wings, introduce, different things
Jet skis and the best weed, think it's fake? Bitch, test me
I'm jet-lagged, don't need a stylist, pants sag, Jimmy Fallon
Blowin' green in the green room, Def Jam like, "Boss really wildin'"
Yeah, they hate but won't box a nigga
Bought the estate from a boxer nigga
Paranoid, I'm walkin' round
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga (Huh)
My chopper, nigga (Huh)
Hahahahaha! I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga
Said I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Look bitch, don’t try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Bitch I don't speak French, look bitch, don't try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
