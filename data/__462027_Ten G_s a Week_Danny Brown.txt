12 ContributorsTen Gâ€™s a Week Lyrics
I'm tryna get paid, tryna fuck hoes
26 inches slamming Cadillac doors
Drowned by the street, floated back to shore
Now I swim in cash and I still want more
(Let's get it)
Used to sip colds (?), now we waste Clicqout
Used to ask Mama, why we gotta be poor
Days got hard, nights got rough
Used to eat a coney on the Gratiot bus
Everyone lies, who can I trust?
Preacher took my money now he got a new truck
Best friend a snitch when his life on the line, soft niggas
Turn tough when they bust that nine
(Nigga)
Easy as pie, proof's in the pudding
Brown like a diamond in the sky and you couldn't
Fit his shoes with both socks on
(uh-uh, uh)
I'm hip hop oxygen
(Yeah)

'Cuz I made ten g's a week banging at my peak
(Let's go)
Smile on my face but inside I weep
My people need jobs, a place to sleep
Voted for the Democratic party but these rich Republicans taking over
About to cop a new Range Rover
Unlucky lost my four leaf clover
And it's so plain to see, you're listening to Brown
And the sounds of my nigga Nick Speed
You might also like
Back on our grizzly, blue foamposites
Cost 350
About make history, smoking on that Pippy 
Traveled many places, kept the D with me
I ain't had a dollar, living off tuna
Heard I was broke, then it wasn't no rumor
Had to make a way, so I said "Fuck it
Newports for dinner just ain't gon' cut it"
Kate Alexander  state
We ain't finished that, bitch bring that cake (?)
Great Lake inheritor, fit me for the crown
Hoes used to spin me, now look how they turn around
Niggas 33, so mad at me
Had a deal forever, ain't known in the D
But I'm still on the ground, heavy in the streets
Ask your A and R, he might know about me

'Cuz I made ten g's a week banging at my peak
Smile on my face but inside I weep
My people need jobs, a place to sleep
Voted for the Democratic party but these rich Republicans taking over
(Uh)
They taking over
(Yeah)
It's Danny Brown
And Nick Speed, what it is
It's Hot Soup Nigga
(Uh)
Libido Sound, y'all know what it is nigga
Fuck with us
