Yeah
Cool in every club like a milli, oh
It's the kid, kid
On fly, I'm fly, hot tamale
I see you baby
Wanna be off in my video, come on
She got me like
Yeah, yeah
Cool in every club like a milli, oh
It's the kid, kid
On fly, I'm fly, hot tamale
I see you baby
Wanna be off in my video, come on
She got me like ohh
Got me going crazy
This girl got me going crazy
She got me like ohh, want her to be my baby
I want her to be my baby

Pretty, round, brown
Driving me wild
Ohh, you make me want to run this damn mining of
Going to the brand new diamond cuts
Got to find the prettiest girl in the world
Make me want to conquer the whole damn world
Shawty got a face like, " Who that girl "
I don't care what it takes to do that girl
You can think anything if you that girl
Just want to make sure you know you heard
The one with the brand new Gucci purse
Christian, that's what she prefers
Bally to Yves, that's what I prefer
All that sex appeal, I need her
She got me high, like how I trophy her
Ever since the scene now, she's been a diva
You know what I mean
You might also like
Shawty got ass and sex appeal, yo
I'm cool in every club like a milli, oh
I'm worth a milli on the spot
On fly, hot tamale, hot tamale
Good enough to be off in my video
She got me like ohh
She got me going crazy
She got me like ohh
Want her to be my baby

Picture white
Looking so bright
Make me want to buy a new Mercedes-Benz
Drive her through the hood, show her off to my friends
Take her to the club, show her ass off again
Pop champagne, let her drink with the friends
Has everybody lookin' right at you
Magazine girl, you deserve an issue
You asked her, " Want to take a picture "
God made you with superstar potential
Load of sex appeal, that's what I'm off into
Baby, want to say the the way I feel
Spending a lot of dough, cause that's the way I deal
Rockin' Republic, the way I kill
Carmelo & Jordans what I'm into
Tila Tequila, the girl I'm into
Young fly high, girl, Future want you
Billion dollar kid ain't shit without you
Make a nigga look rich, standing beside you
How could I hide you
You like ohh
Driving me crazy
She like whoa
She ain't rockin' them fugazy
Shawty got ass and sex appeal, yo
I'm cool in every club like a milli, oh
I'm worth a milli on the spot
On fly, hot tamale, hot tamale
Good enough to be off in my video
She got me like ohh
She got me going crazy
She got me like ohh
Want her to be my babyEmbed
