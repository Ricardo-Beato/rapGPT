What rhymes with shillin? Villain
What rhymes with shmillain? Villain
He's a villain, yes he is

Set it off, adrenaline rush
The boys way beyond a pen and a Dutch
Stronger than Henn, a bag of the dust
You need to watch how they acting with us
Now time to get it in gear
You can get it in right here
Revenge is better than beer
Yo DOOM, it's been a minute, think they getting it clear (Yeah!)
When brothers reunite (When brothers reunite)
Make sure we party right (Make sure we party right)
We rock it all night long
Even beyond the morning light (Morning light)
It's hard to see him in the light
Even harder to see him on the mic
A black Benz beats being on a bike
And he can talk a gay chick outta being a dyke
Like that y'all (New Kurious album)
Freak freak y'all, to the beat y'all (At a store near you, go get it)

Keep it on click fully auto
I won't stop the rock 'til pockets thick and gordo
More so a risk of sounding poor, bro
No tux, who needs tickets to the award show?
Normally cordial
More or less, less is more or no
(*Haaach*) Hock spit out the cockpit
Stuck to the window 'til it's solid as a rock hit
Yes, he is
You might also like
He grabbed the mic like two money bags
Waiting for the getaway to count what he had
Thought he was a spaz, but dude kept wrecking
The crowd remote control, keep 'em all guessing
Funny man gave 'em nothin' like a bummy dare
Taught him how to fight wit' a mic and the hottest stab
But that's the life of a villain
And you know after that, chilling
Went places God's graces don't follow
The big joke, ain't no Cola in the Coke bottle
Writing rhymes 'til the pen go hollow
And been flow hotter than the sunshines of Marrow
It's just the villainous scheme
If not real life, it's still in yo' dreams
Like that y'all, like that y'all
Like that, a-like that and like that y'all

What rhymes with thrillin? Villain
What rhymes with stealin? Villain
He's a villain, yes he is
That's right, I'll smack the black off of ya punk!

Villain, pushin' on the couch cushion
Southside Minneap', never lived out in Brooklyn
Kept the faith, forget the fame
If they sweat the name, let it set the lane
Held mind, cold and hard
Had no regard who the chosen are
Who, you? Oh no
You played the oboe, keep it on the low low
Rappers are candy, butterscotch
I'ma let their baby mothers watch
She loves the ock, I touch the spot
Bitch, I'm the itch that must've got up her crotch, heh
Now stop, fill the buildings
Leave some pills for these little villains
Hey shorty, share the flask
Let me explain why I wear this mask
Villain!
I want you to call me at that address if I'm still there
Gonna make sure you get cracked!2Embed
