Stoned is the way of the Walk
Stoned is the way of the Walk

Well, it's the Alley Cat puffin' on a hootie rat
Some think I'm a criminal but, yo I ain't all of that
Hit'cha with the baseball bat when ya wanna ill though
Wanna mess around, you get fucked on the hill bro
Kick it like a steel toe, real slow hits from the bong
Make me feel like Cheech and I'm kickin' it wit' Chong
Just like Cheech and Chong frontin' with "Ice Cream"
Cypress Hill is here to give you a nice dream
Speak it like a rolla', and you know it's rolled tightly
I'm like the funky beat, so, why ya tryin' ta fight me
Pigs often site me, that's not polite G
And any hour of the day ya know I might be
Harassed by a pig real fast
They wanna Rodney King me, always tryin'a crown my ass
Ain't got no class (Sen Dog: No Class)
I hit they' ass like the buddah that's stinky
They wanna' scruff but, they' just so rinky-dinky
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
Sen got the Philly, and he's gonna light the blunt
Sippin' at the kufu make me go cuckoo!
Somethin' like loco then I turn into this loocoo
Bringin' the beta, yeah, now the funk is risin'
Got the beta bass and the nasal highs and
As I kick a trip, it comin' straight from my sinus
Crazy nasal vocals, cannot make the hotties loco
I remember sista Maggie, breasts were kinda saggy
Used to sell me buddha outta fucked up little baggies
Honey'd up a twenty even when I had no money
She said "Pay me back with some Latin dick Sonnie"
Well I never went out, and I don't think I'm gonna
Just for some buddha, she wanted me to bone her
"Demeaning, ya think ya know what I meanin''
I got somethin' for the ho's ta be schemin' on
I'm the Buddha-Real I take a trip ta hoota'ville
I'll throw ya out the door... of my big blue Seville
Then light another joint, this ain't no exploitation (point)
For we are the ones strollin' in the ways of the masters
You might also like
Stoned is the Way of the Walk
Stoned is the Way of the Walk
Stoned is the Way of the Walk
Stoned is the Way of the Walk

Hit they ass, hit they ass

Like the buddha that's stinky
(Alas, Cap'in there's a ship in sight)
(Huhu, Blast 'em!)1Embed
