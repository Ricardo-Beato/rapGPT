43 ContributorsJumped Out the Whip Lyrics
Huh, Gucci
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Her hair down to her asshole, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her ass all on her back, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her shoe game is fantastic, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
She don't fuck with broke niggas, and I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch

We just rolled in the lot, hoe, hoe what you got?
Make a nigga spend his last like a hole in his pocket
Ice on swole, swole overload, Jenny from the block
Bitch, I wanna enter every hole that you got
Sugar daddy Gucci Mane, I'm holding a knot
You can't even fathom all the hundreds I got
I'ma give you money if you want it or not
A red droptop Phantom just swerved in the lot
Guwop got a sack, have you heard it or not?
And they gon' fuck with Wop whether they nervous or not
Baby, is you gon' give me the service or not?
'Cause that's a big factor if we splurging or not
Why your friend tryna' block for? She know you a thot, hoe
It ain't nuthin' wrong with fucking Gucci on the top floor
Diamonds draped all over me, so drink me on the rocks
This bitch so fucking nasty, I might buy this bitch a watch
You might also like
Her hair down to her asshole, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her ass all on her back, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her shoe game is fantastic, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
She don't fuck with broke niggas, and I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch

Uhh, where she go? There she go
Perico straight from Mexico
Ten kilos, called up Federico
Ready, go, gave Wop some top like there he go
Word to grandaddy Q, came through, couple old hoes acting new
The clothes on bare back and new, the clothes he got on coming soon
I be living life cautious, keep it moving like motions
Keep it smooth, I'm like lotion, we've been swimmin like n'oceans
Why these niggas like vultures? Dang, these bitches got motives
So much Gucci on the loafers, I'ma turn into the spokesman
Oh, it go Wop linked up with the Mob
I say Guwop, let's hit the block, linked up in Dubai

Her hair down to her asshole, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her ass all on her back, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
Her shoe game is fantastic, yeah I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch
She don't fuck with broke niggas, and I love that shit
I just jumped out the whip with a bad little bitch4Embed
