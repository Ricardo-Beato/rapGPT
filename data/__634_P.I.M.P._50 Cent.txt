90 ContributorsP.I.M.P. Lyrics
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, shawty)

Now, shawty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, tryna get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P
You might also like
I don't know what you heard about me (Woo)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holler at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, shawty)

I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holler at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her when I'm done, I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit (Trick)
I don't know what you heard about me (Yeah)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Woo)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see (Uh-huh)
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me (Uh-huh)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Yeah)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

Yeah
In Hollywood they say, "There's no business like show business"
In the hood they say, "There's no business like ho business," you know?
They say I talk a little fast, but if you listen a lil' faster, I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch
Ha-ha-ha
