24 ContributorsReal Lyrics

You niggas ain't real
I think you need to stop pretending
These niggas ain't ill
We know the deal
Niggas ain't on
Here today and the next you're gone
'Cause you niggas ain't real
And we know the deal
Yeah, we know the deal

87 strip walker, I'm a shit talker
Fuck all night, yo, depending what Iâ€™m off of
Had a white girl I tossed her, black girl I lost her
Break bread with the Stones I'm the rock of Gibraltar
Salt of the earth for what it's worth yo from birth
I was first with a verse, live niggas don't rehearse
Wear the prophets on the shirt, yeah, yeah that's the creed
I can give a fuck if it's real or a weave
I tell you when you look good and keep it right there
I'm as important to the Chi as my nigga Mike Air
Jordan 3s on the feet as we breeze down Lake Shore
These are the days that we bake more to make more
I been living in the moment lately
It's like the love and the hate seem to motivate me
Lady lady, that body crazy
You been working out of this thing, if you're not
Tell me if you're really real
You might also like
You niggas ain't real
I think you need to stop pretending
These niggas ain't ill
We know the deal
Niggas ain't on
Here today and the next you're gone
'Cause you niggas ain't real
And we know the deal
Yeah, we know the deal

I'm the sole controller, opposite of sober
Flow from the south side to south Angola
Mami wanna strip, then yeah, I'ma poke her
And go all in and stretch it out like yoga
I'm flexing, sexing, oiled up like Texas
Survivor, soldier, a child is destined
A star is born in a Chicago storm
The name is Common, I'm anything but the norm, uh
Six in the mornin' something warm informin'
I'm sweating like I'm performin' on tour and
Y'all fucking with this like porn
Put your fists up, 'cause you know I ride on
New planes and plateaus, made it through the black hole
I rhyme in a timeless capsule, I rap for
Niggas in the barber shops and broads that's hot
I run the town, I'm a fucking juggernaut
This shit is real
You niggas ain't real
I think you need to stop pretending
These niggas ain't ill
We know the deal
Niggas ain't on
Here today and the next you're gone
'Cause you niggas ain't real
And we know the deal
Yeah, we know the deal
You niggas ain't real
I think you need to stop pretending
These niggas ain't ill
We know the deal
Niggas ain't on
Here today and the next you're gone
'Cause you niggas ain't real
And we know the deal
Yeah, we know the deal7Embed
