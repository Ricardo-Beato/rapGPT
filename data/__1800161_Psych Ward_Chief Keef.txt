Psych Ward
In'm with the Psych Ward
I be coolin' in a Psych Ward
I got some niggas in the Psych Ward
And they be totin' rifles
We tote .40s with the .30s, piped up
Make them pipes bite y'all
You gon' need insurance, Geico, aye

In a Psych, in a Psych
In a Psych Ward you see
A bunch of crazy muthafuckas
Go on Glo Gang territory, you'll see
A bunch of anti-380 muthafuckas
And they gon' blast
They ain't gon' let yo ass get past
And they gon' hop up in 'them cars and do the dash
Like I taught 'em
Bitch, I'm Almighty Sosa
Bitch, you can call me Almighty Sosa
Cuz I get cheese
My niggas in the streets droppin' G's
The only green that I like is Ben Franklin, broccoli and cheese
And I'm crazy like they want me to be
You might also like
Psych Ward
In'm with the Psych Ward
I be coolin' in a Psych Ward
I got some niggas in the Psych Ward
And they be totin' rifles
We tote 40s with the 30s, piped up
Make them pipes bite y'all
You gon' need insurance, Geico, aye

Bitch you crazy
I make bitches go insane, aye
My wrist look crazy
And my necklace go insane, aye
My earrings crazy
Don't make this pistol go insane
Tryna to rob Almighty mane
Don't ever tell Almighty what Almighty can't
I'm always glo'in, I block the rain
And Cinderella is my choppa name
She be cleanin' shit up like my maid
And she very mighty like my name

I be coolin' in a Psych Ward
Aye, I got some niggas in the Psych Ward
Bitch, we got pistols, what we fightin' for?
And tell me, what you bring a knife for?
Psych Ward
In'm with the Psych Ward
I be coolin' in a Psych Ward
I got some niggas in the Psych Ward
And they be totin' rifles
We tote 40s with the 30s, piped up
Make them pipes bite y'all
You gon' need insurance, Geico, aye14Embed
