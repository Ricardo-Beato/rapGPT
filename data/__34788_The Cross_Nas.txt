Braveheart...

I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

Y'all can keep y'all weak beats from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggas Against Society
Noisy I aim, not silently, noose all surroundin' me
I hang 'em, I string 'em up, ain't no thing, I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped
And you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit, it's hard to see R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin' to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him, but he's blinded I see
Jealousy, he love me to death â€” am I'm buggin'?
I love him for life, we both still mournin' on our mothers' life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas diary, get out my path
You might also like
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary would've an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

I can't keep a bitch 'cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty maids
Watering flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin'
Gotta keep a lot of heat; .30 cals, 10 millimeters
.40 cals plus the Heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy
We can sell mo' boats on the coast
Give coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low
But that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the smile
You see a nigga who know, out of three women two out of three
Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil
Bitch! You the reason niggas be beefin', ho get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on it's a new day
Million dollars ain't what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggas, most involved but they fake
Hope y'all relate

I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross, I carry the cross11Embed
