Hey ma, hey ma, hey ma
Hey ma, hey ma, hey ma
I said, "Hey ma," don't go stretching your wallet
These niggas gotta pay me for taking a year from college
Go on, get ya nails polished, stylist for your eyelids
And a pilot for your mileage for them frequent flights to your island
Ms. Brown and Ms. Pollock, little boy done grown up
Little voice done blown up, middle-class that bonus
Hey ma, hey mama Jann; God just gave me another chance
Rod just gave me another line, probably gave me another fan
7-7-3, Oh, since Kanye was a three-old
Down the street from D. Rose, was practicing his free-throws
Shout out to that Gulf Shrimp, shout out to King Gyro
Shout out that Ms. Moody, auntie Toni, them my heroes

We gon' get this paper (Put that on my mama)
You gon' see us laid up (Put that on my mama)
Monica and Ava, thanks for all the favors
Got my money saved up (Put that on my mama)
We gon' get this paper (Put that on my mama)
You gon' see us laid up (Put that on my mama)
Monica and Ava, thanks for all the favors
Got my money saved up (Put that on my mama)

Hey ma, hey ma, I know I never did behave a lot
Never got good grades a lot
And turned your hairs to grays a lot
And go in stores and take a lot
And never shopped, but saved a lot
So you ain't gotta shop at Save A Lot
And you ain't gotta worry about Chase a lot
They playing with your checks, your shit
'Cause they gonna take your pay or not
Que Sera gotta dance, fuck them niggas you smarter than
We just gonna beg your pardon them
Savemoney, my patna dem
I'm part of them, It's part of me
This Save Mula, Bo squad III
I'm riding around my side of town
Hotboxing, no cops around
I had the tux I had the gown
Just had a show, just had to bounce
It's Chance ho, 10 Day
Chano no hable ingles
That language be that chanish but, ooh
Muy caliente
So she just gonna throw her steps on
And haters gonna throw that epsom
And we just gonna throw a party
And I'm gonna just throw my Teflon
'Cause family be that blood though
And I ain't even flexin'
But twin bro be that Victor
And Big Cuz be that Chef Sean
Uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
(Yo, I'm gonna sing)
In what you be in what you do
Don't stop (Being you)
I said don’t stop in what you be, in what you do
Don’t stop (Being you)
Don't stop in what you be, in what you do
Don't stop (Being you)
10 Day

We gon' get this paper (Put that on my mama)

We gon' get this paper (Put that on my mama)
You gon' see us laid up (Put that on my mama)
Monica and Ava, thanks for all the favors
