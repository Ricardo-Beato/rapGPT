Starter cap bro, gone with the hologram
I'm in a rich folk's home like a ottoman
I got green in my hand like a Heineken
I'm throwback like a Flinstone's Vitamin
I'm fire! All I need is the brimstone
I make noise in the streets like a ringtone
My top's hot, so I'm gettin my fade low
I make movies with my lover like J-Lo
I'm living so shiny, ya boy on top
My life on track, a nigga can't stop
I'm Weird like Al, I'm strange like love
I wear hot pink cause it fit like glove
I'm easy on the eyes; I'm hard on a hater
My hoodie lightsaber, like Darth Vader
I'm always with a chick cause a nigga so sick
Need an Entourage quick so you can hug it out bitch

(I'm so fresh)
Oh yeah oh ye oh oh y, oh yeah oh ye, oh oh oh yeah oh ye, oh-oh oh
Oh yeah oh ye oh oh y, oh yeah oh ye, oh oh oh yeah oh y, oh oh y
Oh yeah oh yeah oh oh oh yeah oh y-bring the beat back

I'm so fresh like a Sick Boi oughta be
I'm not tryin that shit, just a part of me
I'm easy, like a Sunday morning
I go to rap battles and I end up yawning
I'm fresh like TexMex in Arizona
Got my gold on forever like my name Ramona
I can't be a loser, the shit don't suit me
A nigga Joe Cool and you niggas just Snoopy!
You can go sue me, try to do outdo me
I look so fresh that I killed George Clooney
I guess you can call me the perfect storm
I'm the reason why your new baby brother was born
A nigga so torn call me Natalie
Cause I love making music but they mad at me
I make money, blow shows like a syndicate
I'mma be who I gotta be, that's the epithet
