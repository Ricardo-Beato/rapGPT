Yeah
*Gunshot, woman screaming*

I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
But now she’s dead and there ain't no comin' back once you there
I hope she knew that I loved her, I hope she knew that I cared
Your food gettin' cold, why don’t you come sit down in this chair?
We can talk about all the things we should have done
All the arguments that you probably would have won
But I'm stubborn, baby, you knew that
When you told me you loved me and I told you I loved you back
But now you layin' on the tile, I’m waitin' for a smile
So I’ll stay here for a while

When the cops come in, they're gonna have to take me away

And I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it"
I guess I'm just emotional and maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close, so why'd I have to give you away?
*Gunshot, woman screaming*
I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I'm not a bad person"
I couldn't take your pain away, I guess I'm undeservin'
But if I can't have you to myself, then you're gone
*Gunshot*
You might also like
I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
Life full of surprises, but that shit isn't fair
Tell me how we live is different, guess this shit kinda rare
Your food gettin' cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair?
We can talk about everything you hate on this earth
And that you're gettin' tired, 'cause you makin' it work
But can I kiss you just one more time?
Baby, lemme close your eyes, feel your lips touchin' mine
I'm sure I've never seen you look more heavenly
Now I'm rubbin' on your back, whisperin', "Rest in peace"
It's okay, baby, go to sleep
I'll keep you safe, you alone with me
Say I wouldn't hurt you, I lied
I don't deserve you, I tried
So I'ma stay by your side

But when the cops come in, they're gonna have to take me away

And I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it"
I guess I'm just emotional and maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close, so why'd I have to give you away?
*Gunshot, woman screaming*
I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I'm not a bad person"
I couldn't take your pain away, I guess I'm undeservin'
But if I can't have you to myself, then you're gone
