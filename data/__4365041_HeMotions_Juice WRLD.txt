Another life
Another day, another blunt
Another day, another lie, blunt
Another night, another day, another night, another...
(Hit-Boy)

Another life, another day, another chance to make it great
I'm running to the money all the time so I can never be late
Just me and my bitch, even though she drive me crazy, she still make my day

Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji

Boat rocking back and forth, what's the commotion?
I told her I'ma drown in her, that bitch an ocean
If I can't make her smile, I'ma be acting wild
She got a new man, I'm gon' pull up on him and shoot him down
I been goin' through emotions, bloody emotions
Pour me a cup, I'ma nod out
Started pack smokin', good dope rollin'
Maybe Mary Jane'll help me put the pills down
Dead inside, catch a look at my ghost
I pull up in a Lambo' or 'Rari or Rolls
Got my girl by my side and they callin' us goals
Numb the pain, take these Percs to the mouth and the nose
I'm not a drug addict, got it all wrong
I'm just a love addict 'til my heart gone
I'm just a love addict with the love songs
You with me is where you belong
You might also like
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
