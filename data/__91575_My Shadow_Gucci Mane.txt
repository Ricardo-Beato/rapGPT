Fifty thousand dollars all in the air and shit
Brick Squad, dope boy, and the money man
Gucci!

I'm a so Icey veteran so you can't say beginner's luck
All my boys tote choppas so your best bet robbin' armored trucks
Georgia boys don't give a fuck, we'll jack you then we'll tie you up
50-50 chance that we'll trick you if you shop with us
Boulder crest so dirty-dirty, zone six boys tote thirty-thirties
Glock 9 under Falcon jerseys make you need a plastic surgery
Bandana under my eye, hat so low can't see my face
And if you got them cakes for baking then Gucc' might pull a home invasion
Hi, my name is Gucci Gucci, meet my homeboy Mackie Slug
Sawed-off AR pulled out, shorty, you know I got extra slugs
Black T still on when I mob, black lugs on still when I walk
Black pistol 23 my nigga he'll think thats my second job

I walk around the city like, it don't matter
The earth my turf, nobody tries me 'cause they know better
So save the chit chatta, I'm too deep, you boys shallow
I run 4 deep, me and myself and I and plus my shadow
Shadow, my shadow, hold me down for whatever
Even if I tried my best, I couldn't run from my shadow
So no matter how wealthy that I get, he's not jealous
So when I have no one to talk to, I talk to my shadow
You might also like
Yeah I'm thorough, under my polo, I'm out on promo
Got these tear drops, under my ezzye, don't make it one more
And I had kilos, one for like 2-0, that was 0-4
I had drizzo, yeah, bags of smizzo, but keep it low though
Don't tell the po-po, I'm friend with fizzo, 'cause thats a no-no
Smokin' guido, me and my vatos, but you's a bozo
I'm passin' low yo, down to La Plizzo, this shit like Wayco
I got candy paint on my '74, your shit from Maaco
And off the tizzop, connect the dizzots, I'm building Legos
Ran the tizzan just like a waffle, I call them eggos
I got hundons, all in my pocket, a stupid bank roll
If ya try me, coroner gon' wrap you up like an egg roll

I walk around the city like, it don't matter
The earth my turf, nobody tries me 'cause they know better
So save the chit chatta, I'm too deep, you boys shallow
I run 4 deep, me and myself and I and plus my shadow
Shadow, my shadow, hold me down for whatever
Even if I tried my best, I couldn't run from my shadow
So no matter how wealthy that I get, he's not jealous
So when I have no one to talk to, I talk to my shadow

Bricks, all white bricks
Corner boy, I probably sold more rocks than a rock pit
Tryna fill my shoes is like an armless man with chops sticks
Got a dark brown soft top Bentley chocolate, huh
I'm so mach 6, homeboy you so not shit
Playin' free, can't come touch me but you're not it
I'm on fire, steaming hot, I can boil grits
Jet-Li with the shoes, Gucci rockin' new kicks
ATLien, baby girl, let's have a moon day
Got eight bedrooms, I'm dying for a roommate
I was home schooled, I didn't have a schoolmate
Psyche, I went to trap school, 60K in 12th grade
I'm a millionaire but self-made wealth craze
Like a junkie cravin' bricks so I'm in kitchens all day
I'm a millionaire but self-made wealth craze
Like a junkie cravin' bricks so I'm in kitchens all day, skrrt
I walk around the city like, it don't matter
The earth my turf, nobody tries me 'cause they know better
So save the chit chatta, I'm too deep, you boys shallow
I run 4 deep, me and myself and I and plus my shadow
Shadow, my shadow, hold me down for whatever
Even if I tried my best, I couldn't run from my shadow
So no matter how wealthy that I get, he's not jealous
So when I have no one to talk to, I talk to my shadow1Embed
