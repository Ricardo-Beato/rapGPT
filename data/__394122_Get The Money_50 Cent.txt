3 ContributorsGet The Money Lyrics
Yeah, 50
I make it feel brand new
Yes they tell me
You make me feel brand new, ha ha
Fuck with me, yeah

It go one for the money, two for the dough
Three for the pimping now early with the hoes
Four for my niggas running around with .44's
Repping that five all the way live
I got a style that reign supreme, Bentley made to lean
Pull up say ''what up?'', make a major scene
Stunt, flash the cream, nine laser beam
It's hard to miss your team, just follow that dot then pop

One for the money (get the money, get the money)
Two for the show (it's showtime)
Three to get the honies (what's up baby), here we go (here we go)
One for the money (get the money, get the money)
Two for the show (it's showtime)
Three to get the honies (what's up baby), here we go (here we go)

I'm a Southside nigga, you can come through and ask for me
Systems thumping and pumping, 2Pac blast for me
Cali show me love, but me I'm from the East
I'm guessing I'm bi-costal when I'm on Dre beats
I get paper, stack paper, blow paper (AHHH!)
Make paper, take paper, I'm major (yeah)
I cake up, new Jacob, nigga, wake up
You owe straight up, pay up or get sprayed up
You might also like
M-O-N-E-Y, it's all good with me (it's all good with me too, baby)
Cause finally I can afford the life of luxury (let's get it, let's get it)
And I remember in the day mamma had to work so hard (ahh man)
Just to pay the rent, all the money spent
Had to get another job (and another job)
And now we're living in an eight room mansion on the hill
(We grew up, I blew up)
And we sipping on, sipping on champagne when we chill
And we riding the Lex, Coupe, Beamers and the Benz (big Benz)
All over the world from the East to the West coast we're making ends (ha ha!)
See, we do it

One for the money (get the money, get the money, yeah)
Two for the show (it's showtime)
Three to get the honies (what's up baby), here we go (here we go)
One for the money (get the money, get the money)
Two for the show (it's showtime)
Three to get the honies (ha ha), here we go (here we go)

The show is what we live for 'cause we love to sing
We gonna freak you up and down (ha ha)
It's how we do our thing (yeah)
And to the ladies in the house tonight
Looking fly, you got it right
It's gonna be an after party and I've got to have somebody
And take her to my eighteen room mansion on the hill (wooowee!)
We'll be sipping on Champagne when we chill
(Big money, big money, come on)
And we're riding in the Lex, Coupe, Beamer and the Benz
(What we riding in? Ha ha)
All the players from the East to the West Coast, we're making ends
This is why we do it
One for the money (get the money, get the money)
Two for the show (it's showtime)
Three to get the honies (what's up baby), here we go (here we go)
One for the money (get the money, money, money, money)
Two for the show (yeah)
Three to get the honies (take money money money), here we go
One for the money (get the money, money, money, money)
Two for the show, three to get the honies
(take money money money money) here we go
One for the money (big money money money money)
Two for the show, three to get the honies
(Get money money money money), here we go

Why we sing? Why we sing?
It's the joy it brings (yeah), joy it brings
You know that you like our style, the reason why, yeah
(You gotta hear me when this shit is playing
And I'm in the shower, man)
The reason why we do what we do (you won't believe it, man)
See we got a love for the music
Simple as one, two, three, sing it

One for the money, two for the show
Three to get the honies (yeah), here we go
(You gon' respect this man)
One for the money, two for the show (this is that shit, right here)
Three to get the honies, here we go
Man, you gonna be able to play this tape
Until I hear this shit coming outta every car, manEmbed
