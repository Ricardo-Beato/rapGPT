3 ContributorsRidiculous Lyrics
It's hilarious (Huh) how your girls is starin', kid
All the flows I carry stickin' (DJ motherfuckin' Rell)
There is no comparison, the clarity is excellent
Breitling cost ya budget, bitch, that's why a nigga flexin' it (Trap-A-Holics mixtapes, burr)
Could've bought a mini mansion, but I bought a necklace
Could've bought a Bentley, but instead I bought the Chevrolet
Donk is sittin' ridiculous, think I send them switches, bitch (Huh)
Nah, them ain't no switches, bitches chrome liftes twenty-sixes (Goddamn)
Trap house with 'bout twenty kitchens
Twenty chickens (Skrrt), twenty minutes (Skrrt)
Twenty chickens (Skrrt), twеnty minutes (Skrrt)
I'ma scratch out every pеnny (Wow, wow)
Two will make a three and that one will bring an extra twenty
I was gettin' it, I admit it, but right now I extra get it
MVP, check my statistics, I just scored a triple-double
Cocaine (Huh), kush and ecstasy, my trap is guaranteed to bubble (Yeah, yeah)
MVP, check my statistics, I just scored a triple-double (Huh)
Cocaine (Huh), kush and ecstasy (Huh), my trap is guaranteed to bubble (Yay)

Hundred-fifty grand on both wrists, this shit ridiculous (Damn)
Rims cost a whole chicken, this shit ridiculous (Damn)
Chain cost a whole ticket, this shit ridiculous (Yeah)
Hummer truck on thirty inches, this shit ridiculous (Huh)
Sixteen for a whole chicken, this shit ridiculous (Damn)
Powder 'round the whole kitchen, this shit ridiculous (Damn)
Watch ya mouth cause the feds listenin', this shit ridiculous (Jeez)
Watch ya boy cause that nigga snitchin', this shit ridiculous (Huh)You might also like2Embed
