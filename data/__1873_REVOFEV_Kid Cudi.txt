Yeah! Welcome, welcome you!
Hey! I am your big brother
What do I have to say to the kids?

Let go, life does get tough
No need to stress, hold you back too much
Let's go, I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the revolution?

Oh, whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Whoa, whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Whoa, whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Whoa, whoa (What do I say to the kids?)
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

Wake up, things might get rough
No need to stress, keeps you down too much
Wake up, I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the revolution?
