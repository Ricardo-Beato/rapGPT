21 ContributorsDickriders Lyrics
The word around town is this nigga six months (huh?)
She ain't really pretty, she just Instagram stuntin'
Proper-talkin', bitch

A nigga got pregnant, he was dickridin' so much
The word around town is this nigga six months (huh?)
She ain't really pretty, she just Instagram stuntin'
Fake proper-talkin', bitch be like "Please pass the Backwood" (what?)
Trap boy Jack, I get the pack and run it back
What they say 'bout Guwop, stop the track, shit, run it back
Big bro was a good boy, he sacked the quarterback
But I was just a hood-boy, bricks in my culdesac (brick)

Jordan number five, Gucci man, I'm still alive (whoa)
Domino, vamanos, pull up with a pie (domo)
Middle finger with the five, fuck the GBI (fuck 'em)
Mississippi, country nigga, crooked letter I (sip)
Matty with the eye, call me Patty with the pies (Patty)
I'm comin' ov', on the stove, look like I'm whippin' rocks (skrrt)
Fuck her lookin in her eye, then I tell a lie
I'm leaving now, don't tell her why, I just tell her "Bye" (bye)
Club full of side-hoes, givin' the side-eye (side)
Pull up murk the parkin' lot, call it a drive-by (grrah)
She tired of the small-fry, she want the big guy (Gucci)
It's a lot of niggas snitchin', lot of niggas tellin' lies (liar)
