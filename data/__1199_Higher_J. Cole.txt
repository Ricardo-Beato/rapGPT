53 ContributorsHigher Lyrics
Come here, I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here, I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one

Hey, uh
What up girl? Tell me how you feelin’
You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a filling
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill-in?
She said, "Looks kill and I’m tryna make a killin'"
And God willing, I’d be chilling on the boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain’t dealin’ with no broke nigga
Down in Miami with a super ho team
Tryna bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Oh, she down in Dallas at the All-Star game
Spittin’ All-Star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name, somethin’ like James
Somethin like Wade, if you something like paid
You can fuck tonight, yeah, she sayin', "Fuck some nice J's
What about your life savings?" Won’t spend her life slavin’
So she graduated, rich nigga wife training
And if you got money, man the head is amazing
You might also like
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one

What up girl? Tell me how you been
Ain’t seen ya since the 12th grade, even back then
Thought you was a cutie, though your booty mad thin
But you done got thick on a nigga, goddamn
Hey now, I got a thing for you
It's been a long time comin', I should hang with you
'Cause see way back, I thought to fuck with you was impossible
Count your baby daddy’s now, two and a possible
Uh, you still got it though, yeah, you still got it though
Girl your body lookin’ like a fuckin’ pot of gold
You got your mean little walk with the model pose
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes
You still got it though, yeah, you still got it though
You got your nails did, damn girl, you're on a roll
Do you give brains? Did you make the honor roll?
Don’t worry bout your man baby, he ain’t gotta know
Come here, I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here, I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one

Hey, I get bored so fast that they won’t last
But girl you’re special like I met you in the slow class
'Cause yo ass got me fiending for ya so far
My life is like a movie, would you be my co-star?
Like Halle Berry? Your old nigga act like a bitch, like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Calipari
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex, you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn’t VIP then
But I was plotting on you, I really wish that I'd have got to know you
Before we grew up and I blew up with these Benjamins
That way I know for sure your love is really genuine
Is you my homie? Well show me what kind of friend you is
What if it's phony? Yeah only 'cause I can give you ends
Too late for turning back, fuck it, we continuing
Get your ass in that position I love to bend you in
Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one22Embed
