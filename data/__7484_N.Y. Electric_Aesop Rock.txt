31 ContributorsN.Y. Electric Lyrics
New York
I could probably put some shit over the "New York" shit
Staten Isle
The Up-state, Tri-state, Universal
(Just for my people)
All day, NY, New York, Yeah, From NY, Long Isle, Bronx, Brooklyn, Up-town
Yeah, we're where it’s at
Get down
In NY, we're where it’s at in NY
Get down

I cut the ropes breathe
Fresh puddles of pigeon blood and smoke.  Load bazooka
Scoped the culprit hulks over a broken hookah
Got rebel camps with siphons amped to cookie-cut the wattage
Electric ilk NY raised on b-movie sluts and gossip
Conditioned the bodega rodent moment composure to echo numb and uncommon, dumb monkey pollen
My 23's lean over a cobra motor milligram bender, novelty
I tip lids prior to clipping the comradery
Check the muck out
When metal maggots burrow in Promised Land vein division I tug my brim down over my astigmatism, low pro
Paxil Rose, Axl broke and butchered
Last catapult standing in a land of coke and hookers
King Kong potluck, no parking for rickshaw loads of sock puppets and sitcoms
Just Krylon pigs bred in a hot boxed wigwam
Serotonin deficient teens demonstrate ease in the modern day Uzi purchase
The foundation of their alacrity makes the mothers nervous
Me? Oh I check the newest murals to see whose still bombing this fucker and um respect”
Find out what it means to me, New York
Walk blocks with electric ninjas who bark/bounce for trunked out whips
Like, "My company DeLorean's the shit"
Skipper's out of happy pills again
He's in the neighbors garbage.  (Ahh Skippy)
He's making paper dolls decorated with targets  (Don't do it)
He's labeling the dolls with the names of shitty rap artists (Nooo)
Then tearing out the still-beating heart from the loose-leaf carcass
I ordered a hovercraft off the back page of an Archie comic
Built it in three days to float above snarky comments
My gills call the East River rock bottom home with three-eyed guppies and seahorse mutations
See, New York is ancient Rome.  Basic.  Basically stone.  Faces
My friend jumped off the Empire State Building while I hung with 10th grade head cases
"Some of them will blossom famous", some of them will blossom baseheads
But they all rep rivets in the die-cast metal Voltron cadence, what?

Kill 'em all slow
I was on a serious tree bender with my hands up at a C-Rayz-Walz show
Nether-circuit bacon don't police me anymore
Your trained professionals demonstrate 41 shots over par
Least common denominator raise truth like Charlie, Willy and Gramps raise roofs in a glass Wonkavator (Monster Maker)
Operate wild by the company of unturned stones and litter
Talk his way out of a sunburn and be home in time for dinner
Paid dues since before the days of bad acid and Quaaludes
While the boombox talks trash to the Richter
Stalking awkward with a zip lock on the pill hole
Bitter fucker, nothing is free
I'll spend my last dollar on me
Put one up for my family, should've made time to thank 'em
Put one up for my crew, for recognizing the sanctum
Put one up for the socially broke, choked and smoky New York piss hiss bleed Dolby, homey

All my niggas holdin it down in NY, that's my mother fuckin word

"You’ve been all over the world
You’ve hunted just about every kind of game
You’ve stalked elephant, lions, tigers, polar bears, deer
You’ve been within 15, 20 yards the most dangerous game in the world
You’ve been everywhere
You’ve been with some of the most famous guides and hunters in the world
What’s the biggest thrill you’ve ever had out of all of that?"
"Well I think I can answer that best by calling attention to the ..."
