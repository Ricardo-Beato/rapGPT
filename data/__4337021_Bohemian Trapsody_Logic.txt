Every night
I grab a little piece of earth and make it ignite
I'm a satellite
Drifting through your nova at the speed of light
Every night
I grab a little piece of earth and make it ignite
I’m a satellite
Drifting through your nova at the speed of light
I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know
I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I should know
Yes, I said, yes, I said, yes, I said, yes, I should know, oh

And when I fall for you
That's when I'll break down my wall for you
Promise that I’d risk it all for you
Promise to reveal my all for you
That's when I fall for you
That's when I'll break down my wall for you
Promise that I'd risk it all for you
Promise to reveal my all for you

Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Yeah)

Elevated, feelin' elevated, took a hit of weed and shit escalated
Feeling innovative, I'ma integrate it, yeah, that's why I made it
Keep it classic, yo' shit is dated

Pass the weed like a legislator, like–like, goddamn26Embed
