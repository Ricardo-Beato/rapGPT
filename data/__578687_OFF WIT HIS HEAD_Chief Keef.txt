19 ContributorsOFF WIT HIS HEAD Lyrics
(Off The Wall Gang)
(Damn, that's Surreal right there?)
Ayy, ayy
Niggas at your freakin' head
Click-clack, niggas really scared (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Niggas at your freakin' head, click-clack, really scared
I'ma run these motherfuckin' people just like Diddy did
Get my alcohol, weed, and my businesses
Savage just like Beans, that's who Beanie Sigel is
Up them poles, heatin' shit like I play for Heat and shit
Pistol beatin' shit, you don't know what pistol beatin' is
Ridin' 'round town, prayin' to God with the SIG
Smoke a nigga like a cig', bang, off with his head, ayy

Better play with your bitch, you better play with your kids
My niggas, they savages, you better play with your ear
On the jet, on the Lear like I'll perform in here
I got my gun in here, so be alarmed in here
You want beef? There's farms in here, a lotta armor in here, ayy
Boy, we got the llamas here, them stupid choppers here, ayy
Leave you where you stand, you gon' need a doctor in here
I brought my guap in here, I can pay your doctor bills
Pay your mama bills, pay your partner bills
Pay a lotta bills, pay my bank deposit bills
I got a lotta clips, I drive a lotta whips
Like I'm at the casino, I won a lotta chips
I brought my mop in here, that dirty bop in here
It'll bop your eyeballs, it'll bop your ear
I brought my mop in here, hey, dirty bop in here, ayy (Click-clack)
It'll bop your eyeballs and it'll bop your ear, bang
You might also like
Niggas at your freakin' head, click-clack, really scared
I'ma run these motherfuckin' people just like Diddy did
Get my alcohol, weed, and my businesses
Savage just like Beans, that's who Beanie Sigel is
Up them poles, heatin' shit like I play for Heat and shit
Pistol beatin' shit, you don't know what pistol beatin' is
Ridin' 'round town, prayin' to God with the SIG
Smoke a nigga like a cig', bang, off with his head, ayy

Smokin' on this Tooka, plottin' on a million
Got a lotta children, these niggas my children
Try to smoke some Tooka, this shit, it might kill you
Tryna get some money, my nigga, I feel you
Coolin' with the Glo, ayy, that's my La Familia
For my family, I'll kill ya, at the red light, drill ya
Pull up on you slow, ride off like a Steeler
I think I'm from Pittsburgh, bitch, I got my steel up
'Member bein' a stealer, your car could get peeled up
Baby, I heard your car on E, fuck with me, it get filled up
When I look in the mirror, I see a young black nigga
That made it out the Southside where the fuckin' drills was
Ridin' with my tooly, and I'm down to drill ya
Waste your ass, spill ya, Flintstone, Fred and Wilma
She gon' give me coochie 'til my fuckin' deal up
It can go down anytime, but I'm still up
Niggas at your freakin' head, click-clack, really scared
I'ma run these motherfuckin' people just like Diddy did
Get my alcohol, weed, and my businesses
Savage just like Beans, that's who Beanie Sigel is
Up them poles, heatin' shit like I play for Heat and shit
Pistol beatin' shit, you don't know what pistol beatin' is
Ridin' 'round town, prayin' to God with the SIG
Smoke a nigga like a cig', bang, off with his head, ayy

(Damn, that's Surreal right there?)
