5 ContributorsShow Money Lyrics
Freeband taliban
Yeah
Freeband Scooter in this bitch

When you top the charts niggas wanna start beef
I blew 50k this week and I did it for the streets
Fuck the show money nigga, fuck the show money nigga
I do it for the fans all my niggas with the bands
The bad bitches everywhere they love me I ain’t playin’ (they love the kid)
Fuck the show money nigga, fuck that show money nigga

I just topped the charts and I’m still duckin’ narcs
Madness dropped the car I drive it like a Golf cart
I got Phipps plaza in my trunk and on my backseat
Ain’t nothing bout me cheap I blow 50 thou this week (racks)
And bout 20 in my sleep, for my niggas who got caught up in the street?
I got goons who put , 
Now ya scared to go to sleep
Now don’t get into the beef cause the shits too fuckin’ weak
Cause I rather fuck a freak give her right back to the streets
 I’m commander and the chief
Flow a million me a G, Casino and Ali
Freebandz is the gang nigga fuck the industry
You might also like
When you top the charts niggas wanna start beef
I blew 50k this week and I did it for the streets
Fuck the show money nigga, fuck the show money nigga
I do it for the fans all my niggas with the bands
The bad bitches everywhere they love me I ain’t playin’ (they love the kid)
Fuck the show money nigga, fuck that show money nigga

Sandy in my right pocket fuck some show money
Free bands we the definition of money
Street niggas gotta switch up your hustle
Them folks watching, niggas snitching, streets watching
The pressure on, he can’t take it he gone fold
Bankrolls I’m talking Ben Franklins nigga
Show money, I make 100k a week
I ain’t talking bout on no stage
Im talking bout on the street niggas
All my fans street niggas  Black Amigo Gang
Welcome to the trenches, where they show out for some bands
Lil Mexico City, Lil Mexico city, that show money na I don’t need it

When you top the charts niggas wanna start beef
I blew 50k this week and I did it for the streets
Fuck the show money nigga, fuck the show money nigga
I do it for the fans all my niggas with the bands
The bad bitches everywhere they love me I ain’t playin’ (they love the kid)
Fuck the show money nigga, fuck that show money nigga
Top 100 bout to go and drop 100 on a GT Bentley Coupe, just for the summer
I’m surrounded by piranhas, eat yo face like jeffery dammer
Know the da might be listening
But fuck em ain’t stunt em cause you can’t judge a book by its cover motherfucker
Cause I’m a hood nigga get respected like stunna
Went and redid the Breitling nothing but 40 pointers
Got them bitches jolly rancher whole carrots on me
Psyched out to the point I’m bout to fuck a nigga wife (straight up)
I can ruin a nigga life all it take is one night
When your girl come up missing cause she get pipe

When you top the charts niggas wanna start beef
I blew 50k this week and I did it for the streets
Fuck the show money nigga, fuck the show money nigga
I do it for the fans all my niggas with the bands
The bad bitches everywhere they love me I ain’t playin’ (they love the kid)
Fuck the show money nigga, fuck that show money niggaEmbed
