We start controlling the Dow Jones Industrial, and start using niggers in the world bank, and every time the president wanna raise the price of gold, he gotta call twelve of us in and six of them, then we set

Beat them all

Hey dude, why you buildin’ the wall
Think you got enough balls
You ain’t got enough nerves
You ain’t got enough gall
Finger pointin’ at y’all
Tired of you pickin’ my pocket
Sucker sucker you fall
Hear me rage like a prophet
Face to face and who smack it
Hear my point so you got it
See your ass try to stop it
You ain’t never improved
Now you fuckin’ up food
We the people get sued
Is that arrogance dude
Got you comin’ off rude

Know you gotta beat ‘em
If you can’t join ‘em
Know you gotta beat ‘em
If you can’t join ‘em

To the beat y’all, you don’t stop

Greatest players playin’
Greatest band in the world
Greatest rhymers be sayin’
Greatest band in the world
What the fuck is the problem
That your world ain’t solvin’
Where your planet dissolvin’
Corporations replacin’
What y’all callin’ a nation
Playin’ with population
Why the fuck you surprised
45 spreadin’ hatred
Lids over the eyes
Push you once, push you twice
When the fuck are y’all ready to fight?
If you can’t join ‘em
Know you gotta beat ‘em
If you can’t join ‘em
Know you gotta beat ‘em
If you can’t join ‘em
Know you gotta beat ‘em
If you can’t join ‘em
Know you gotta beat ‘em
If you can’t join ‘em
Know you gotta beat ‘em
And hear the beat go

Get the fuck outta here
It’s weird engineers
Got millennials
Got ‘em got ‘em livin’ in fear
Strippin’ robbin’ their years
Peers, digital tears
Drippin’ into their beers

Beat them all (Beat them all)
Beat them all (Beat them all)
Beat them all (Beat them all)
Beat them all (Beat them all)Embed
