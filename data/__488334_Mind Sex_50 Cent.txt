3 ContributorsMind Sex Lyrics
Its 50, Yeah
It's time I laid back on em
Real smooth yeah

I'm not down for the mind sex
I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet
You can burn an in-scent
Lay back and relax
Feel the good vibrations
After we fuck I don't want a conversation

Pardon me love damn that ass lookin' right
What you doin' tonight
You should stop by aight
My body language say it all
So we ain't gotta talk
I got a fly spot southside queens New York
Now I know you know I wanna fuck
No doubt but tonight we try a different route
Don't say a word
Un-button your blouse
Pull that skirt down
Come to my bed itâ€™s time to put in work now
You might also like
I'm not down for the mind sex
I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet
You can burn an in-scent
Lay back and relax
Feel the good vibrations
After we fuck I don't want a conversation

Nubian princess show me your interests
Wait let me guess you like my ghetto poetry
Here's a little something I wrote down
In case you ever came around
You hear that fly shit
You know it's me
Position after position
I'll exploit your body
Like an instructor for yoga or advanced Pilates
We working up a sweat
You like it how I like it?
Go ahead go up and down
I like it when you ride it

I'm not down for the mind sex
I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet
You can burn an in-scent
Lay back and relax
Feel the good vibrations
After we fuck I don't want a conversation
Motherfuckin' right I don't want no conversation
Talk to a bitch try to explain to her why she should give me some boyzes and the bitch slow. First she know then she don't know if she gonna give some boyzes, she slow. So I ain't supposed to be hangin' out with no mentally retarded ho, you know shit like that, you know what I'm sayin'? It's the kid man, It's the 50 man.
