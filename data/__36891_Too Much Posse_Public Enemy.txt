6 ContributorsToo Much Posse Lyrics
Alright party people, bust a groove
It's guaranteed to shake your butt and make you move
I got a little something fly that's gonna keep you high
It's not a drug from my little rug
It's rap for your ear hole that we call a bug
Ya know what I'm sayin'
Now bust it out
There's a lot of people out there that's building up a force
Of course, that we call a posse
None will be grown when you good to go then you're gone
You start up with two
And you end up with two thousands by the millions
You dig what I'm sayin'
Now there's a lot of posses out there
Trying to take over posses
And trying to turn those posses into their posse
But when you got too much
Like the gear grabbin' clutch of such and such
Nobody can take yours
Or they'll be sweatin' from the pores
Trying to take whatcha got
They're so hot from the pot
So they catch a bad cold
Their nose runnin' with the snot
Ya know what I'm sayin'
You might also like
What do you got to say about this?
A force so strong that you can't resist
You may as well join 'em, you know you can't beat'em
Pack a hundred people, ya know ya gonna need'em
Straight with the system is down by law
'Cause every half hour they get nine more
They run all dollars that come in town
So either join the crew or get beat down
I watched all the guys be so damn cruel
Try to get fast, you must be a fool
Blood through and through, the boys don't play
I seen 'em tax and run an operation today
They got too, too, too much posse

Yeah, I had a party, much people came by
I'm talking to a G 'cause the G real fly
Chillin' in my room, chewin' off her ear
Chillin' stupid fly 'cause I got stupid gear
My door kicked open by her man and crew
The G turned to me and said, "Who you?"
I said, "Yo fly"
"Yeah," the G lied
Stuck in the corner while the G cried
And then from the back, my homeboys came
With uzis and nines and said, "Go blame"
Ya lying ass girl with the fake tears
We got a big posse and we show no fears
We got too, too, too much posse
We got too, too, too much posse
Yeah, that's right
Now get ready to step off
Ya know what I'm sayin'
And all you posses out there
That's trying to out posse the posse
Yo, we got the stuff that'll scatter your brains
From here to White Plains
Ya know what I'm sayin'
We got the shit that you just can't fuck with1Embed
