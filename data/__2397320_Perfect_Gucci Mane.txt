11 ContributorsPerfect Lyrics

I’m tryna get it my way
They say Guwop got bales and bricks, that’s what the FBI say
Half a million dollar car, I pulled it out the driveway
Got 2 million dollars on a bus pulled over on the highway
Nigga owe me, come back shooting like Big Worm did on Friday
These niggas twitter beefing but I keep AK's at MySpace
We all in its entirety, menace to society
Rich and black minority, white folks call me violent
They tried to ban Gucci Mane music, and the people started rioting
Drop top Maserati, no more fucking license
Man look what they did to 2Pac, look what they did to Tyson
I got two vices, smoke weed and shot dices

I just bought two pints, and they look perfect
I don’t want no bitches out the hood ‘less they look perfect
I just bought some Forgi’s for the Phantom now it look perfect
Ever since I ran into your nanny, that bitch look perfect
I don’t want no, ‘less they looking perfect
I just need my, ooh it look perfect
Baby bring me the, baby the candy look perfect
I won’t touch on that, unless it look perfect
You might also like
I want an AR; I’m drinking on the day job
I ain’t talking ‘bout no motherfucking 
DK hit em with the fucking car
I’ma hit em with the fucking AR
I’ma cash out on them bitches, get it right back out the trenches
Fucking on em way too fast, I need a ticket
Like I’m beefing with her brother, man you know Lil Mama with it
Bought her ten pairs red bottoms, man you know Lil Mama shitted
Killing em, red tatted lips on the coochie, man you know my dog gon’ kiss it
DK casino, I pass em to him, and you know he gon’ kill it kill it
And you know my plug came from a village
And you know my room Michael Jordan image
And you know I’m really Scottie Pippen bitches

I just bought two pints, and they look perfect
I don’t want no bitches out the hood ‘less they look perfect
I just bought some Forgi’s for the fend’ now it look perfect
Ever since I ran into your nanny, that bitch look perfect
I don’t want no, ‘less they looking perfect
I just need my, ooh it look perfect
Baby bring me the, baby the candy look perfect
I won’t touch on that, unless it look perfectEmbed
