Ooh, yeah, yeah

Culture, culture, culture
Culture, culture, culture

Say they want the culture (culture)
Eat it up, turn them to vultures (to vultures)
Migo Gang pull up like soldiers (Gang)
And when we pull up, we got chauffeurs, chauffeurs

Tell 'em do it for the culture, do it for the culture
Got to do it for the culture, do it for the culture
Tell 'em do it for the culture, do it for the culture
Got to do it for the culture, do it for the culture, culture

I wake up and I thank God and I go strong (I thank God)
I wake up and look at my ice and put it on (put it on)
She gon' fuck, she look at my life and wanna be on (at my life)
But we not havin' it (no), Huncho hit it and passin' it (Huncho Quavo)
I'm too passionate (passionate), I'm too focused on my craft
I need a million dollar slab, bring it back and break it down
With the whole gang right now, flyin' in and out of town
You was searchin' for the wave, it was Culture what we found, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You was searchin' for the wave, it was Culture what we found
Culture, culture, culture, yeah
You was searchin' for the wave, it was Culture what we found
Culture, culture, culture
Believe me when I say we create our own sound
Culture, culture, culture
I know you see it now, what they be screamin' 'bout
You might also like
Say they want the culture (culture)
Eat it up, turn them to vultures (to vultures)
Migo Gang pull up like soldiers (gang)
And when we pull up, we got chauffeurs, chauffeurs

Tell 'em do it for the culture, do it for the culture
Got to do it for the culture, do it for the culture
Tell 'em do it for the culture, do it for the culture
Got to do it for the culture, do it for the culture, culture

Do it for the culture (culture), only time that I be focused (focused)
They some culture vultures, bite the lingo when we wrote it (wrote it)
Culture is a wave (culture), everybody wanna ride it (ride)
They geeked up for days (days), they gon' wait and keep they eyes on it (eyes)
Put your mind on it (mind), watch me defeat my opponent (mind)
Keep your eyes on it, don't lose sight, we all want it (eyes)
I work hard, don't I? Now they watch me on the Sony (TV)
Can't fuck with you jabronis ('bronis), pussy niggas ridin' ponies, culture

Ride the wave (ride), too busy occupied, gettin' paid (occupied)
I'ma duck off and hibernate (duck off)
Win the Grammys and hire a Wraith (win the Grammys)
I can pull up, no diamonds today (pull up)
I can walk on the moon in the Wraith (moonwalk)
We created the food and you ate it (hey)
We the biggest of groups, we the greatest (yeah)
Jets, I ride in the latest (jets)
Outdated, you fell and you faded (outdated)
I am a Nawf Side native (Nawf side)
Crocodile, Hermes, gator (crocodile)
I'ma get the bag every angle (get the bag)
Mama got Cartier bangles (Mama)
Audemars ring, Uranus (Audemars)
Mansion' with the leak on the paintings
Oh, say (say), "Can you see?" (see)
My people prayed (prayed) and take a knee
We don't need stripes 'cause we got bright stars
We gon' still fight (fight) for that race car (car)
When you do right (right), that's 'cause you work hard (hard)
They gon' divide us all (all), that's when it falls apart (apart)
Tryna save the whole world, but it ain't my job (job)
No, it ain't my job
They told me, "Ride the whole wave like I drive my car"
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Mama told me, "Break out of these chains, son and you'll go far"
(Mama! Yeah, yeah)
