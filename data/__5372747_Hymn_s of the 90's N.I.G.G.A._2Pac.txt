7 ContributorsHymn’s of the 90's N.I.G.G.A. Lyrics
Underground Railroad
Mercedes my nigga what's up baby
(Mac my nigga what's up?)
Yo Pac 
A lot of niggas goin' on nigga

Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished

Dave Duke sure look cute in that black suit (Oooohhh)
But even cuter behind the barrel of my six shooter (Hey!)
You look worried 'cause I ain't buried? Punks leave in a hurry
'Cause I throw flurries, makin' motherfuckas scurry
Come feel the flavor from my single, and brain cell's tingle
I'm feelin' stronger than a fuckin' mad Dingo and uh
How's that for black history?
I stay strapped and love to jack those that slang that crack misery
'Cause bein' a nigga means you love niggas
But how could you love niggas, if you tryna drug niggas?
You mothafuckas need your cap's peeled
'Cause when blacks kill blacks, we stay trapped and that's real
And we don't need no more statistics (Why?)
It's time to get more realistic for the young the black and the gifted
And until my people get uplifted, there's no poppin' shit
Just poppin' clips, instead of marchin' we gon' rip shit
Some say the government'll watch me, but they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse (Yeah)
And even if they pull they triggers, they can shoot one man
But nothing's gonna stop the plan of true niggas

Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished

Yo
I'm pullin' my gat on suckers like that, give me that white hood
My niggas is strapped, wearin' black rollin' phat, I wish you would
With beam's on target can't dodge it don't flinch and inch (nigga)
Nobody move, nobody gets hurt shot up or lynched, pinched
Me if I'm dreamin' feds are schemin' on me
Plus the Devils got a shovel and it's beamin' on me
I tried to make the system work for me
Some say why bother?
I gotta make it that way, so they don't take it away from me partner
When I was younger ran wild as a kid
My neighbor won the lottery, I planned a robbery I sure did
I pull out my gat for no reason it's jackin' season
Leavin' a scene with all the green  more than even
I'm the quicker nigga uppercut a sucker, the Railroad's live
On the jack move, you better back off smooth
Nothin' can save ya from the vap's I'm makin' pap's now
Relocation and I'm stationed in the Oaktown (Oaktown)
And you can be a nigga too if you try
Some look at me strange, shake they head and ask why
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Niggas be proud and sing this song like a songstress
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished

Ignorant not so I give a shock to your brain
I'm doin' thing's most niggas my age can't fade
But if you think about it, maybe they could growin' up like me
Held down in the hood
'92 niggas bankin' on shit they can't see
In 1967 niggas still wasn't free
So when I came here I had to learn the ropes
Put my pants to the side, slipped on my loc's
I stepped out into the world  new to me
I tried to make myself true, to my history
But fuck it, 'cause I'ma nigga that's makin' much leeway
Despite the trap's and the punk bitch hearsay
The Underground Railroad's strong as hell
With the help of some brother who won't let me fail
So we keep on strivin' with the title that was forced
But don't trip courage, strength, and pride wasn't lost
So if they call you one, please don't get offended
Even though offense, is what the kid intended
We are from a long line of true motherfuckas
So knuckle up and let 'em know you always
Throw down for your brothers, they your niggas
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
Never ignorant, gettin' goals accomplished
