16 ContributorsAchieve Lyrics
Hey, Thug, what they say, homie?
Check this out, right?
Bein' broke, that's bad for my health, right?
I got so much of this shit, I signed myself
All I want you to do right now
I want you to talk to these folk and tell 'em how it really is, right?
'Cause we havin' so much money right now...
Haha, you know what's happenin'

And I'm suwoo but I wrote this with a blue pen
And this the movement, please join in
And they like "Thug really do this"
And I'm lucky to tell y'all this the blueprint
And I wonder why they hatin' on me
I guess the ice got they main bitches skatin' on me
Maybe my car 'cause the next year's datin's on it
TIP, I'm a young king, please put the cape on me
Thug go in, curfew
I'm on a lot of tracks, they say the Thug startin' to irk you
And y'all eatin' shit, that's baby food, burp you
If Wayne flow is kush, then my shit is on purple
But my flow is sick, it's dyin', I need a donor
And I'm so great, when I leave I need a cloner
I didn't ride a wheel so that Phantom gon' need a owner
And your ho be totally screamin', she's not a moaner
I told Wayne I was ready for the paper like Usher
He said, "Cool, sit back, stay away from busters"
Now Thug got the big head, I am a Gusher
I am not the best but I am better than others
You might also like
And I know you believe in me
And I am at the top, you shall achieve with me
And I am not gon' stop so you'll succeed with me
I'll have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know you know I know you'll succeed with me
And I know you know I know you'll achieve with me
I'll have your body frozen, your degrees with me

I'm at the tip top, ain't no toppin' me
I want the whole thing, now watch me re-rock a ki'
And I ain't wanna flex, so I called bee-bee
Sippin' on this mud got me bobbin' and leanin'
I hopped out the porch just like Skooly
Me and Young Thug on this one, it's a movie
Pull up in that drop head, mouths drop like droopy
Now they sayin' I got the big head like Stewie
I took a break from the rap for a reason
Now I can ride drop head flyin' down Cleveland
Whoever thought me and my crew be ridin' horses
Panoramic car, that mean back to back Porsches
They sayin' I fell off 'cause I ain't brought the new whip through
But when I bring it back I'ma paint that bitch crip blue
And still post up on the Ave with my boy Big Boo
And a hundred young niggas and they all screamin', "Suwoo"
I went to church just to chill in the pulpit
Young Mario got shot, yeah, that's still some bullshit
But Thug, I can't let it handle you
I'ma take you off to Cleveland, aka the Zoo
And my bitch look like a Barbie
I have a new spot in Houston no Marcus
Yeah, nigga, you don't wanna start it
Lil Tee, bring the troops, we the sergeants
Ride the beat like a ROC Crew Harley
And if y'all ballin' with the bands we Spalding
Bet a couple M's and I'm all in
And I'm so high, in ten days I'll still be fallin'

And I know you believe in me
And I am at the top, you shall achieve with me
And I am not gon' stop so you'll succeed with me
I'll have your body frozen, your degrees with me
With me

Yeah, and I'm the motherfuckin' realest
And every nigga that hear about me say I'm the fuckin' illest
And y'all motherfuckers brainless, no ceilings
Bought the new Bentley coupe, the roof, I had to fuckin' kill it
Bought my bitch the new Audi, we need to switch 'cause I like it
When I don't like to drive we bought the jet so I can fly it
They say I'm sexy but my face look kinda mean so don't fright it
And niggas know I shoot, if they say I don't, then they lyin'
And if they say they shot back they a front
The only niggas shot back was the runts
So shoutout to the runts
I'm the realest, no front
I'm sorry, I had to kick it like a punt, yeah
And I know you believe in me
And I am at the top, you shall achieve with me
And I am not gon' stop so you'll succeed with me
I'll have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know you know I know you'll succeed with me
And I know you know I know you'll achieve with me
I'll have your body frozen, your degrees with meEmbed
