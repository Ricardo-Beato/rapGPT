Mm

I been a (G), throw up the (L), sex in the (A.M.), uh-huh
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I can put you in (First class, up in the sky)
I can put you in (First class, up in the s—, up-up in the s—)
I been a (G), throw up the (L), sex in the (A.M.), uh-huh
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I can put you in (First class, up in the sky), mm, mm
I can put you in (First class, up in the s—, up-up in the s—)

I can see the whole city from this balcony
Back in 2019, I was outside freely, but now they got it out for me
I don't care what frat that you was in, you can't alpha me, keep dreamin'
Pineapple juice, I give her sweet, sweet, sweet semen
I know what they like so I just keep cheesin'
Hard drive full of heat seekin'
Tryna come the same day as Jack? Rethink it
You don't need Givenchy, you need Jesus
Why do y'all sleep on me? I need reasons
Uh, I got plaques in thе mail, peak season
Shout out to my UPS workers makin' surе I receive 'em
You can do it too, believe it
You might also like
I been a (G), throw up the (L), sex in the (A.M.), uh-huh
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I can put you in (First class, up in the sky), mm, mm
I can put you in (First class, up in the s—, up-up in the s—)

(Are you ready?) Ha, yes, I am
They say, "You a superstar now," damn, I guess I am
You might be the man, well, that's unless I am
Okay, I'll confess I am
Go ahead and get undressed, I am
Okay, cool, you on Sunset? (I am)
I'm 'bout to slide, okay, I'm outside, okay
This lifestyle don't got many downsides
'Cept for the lack of time I get 'round my
Family, makin' sure they never downsize
I got visions of my mom sayin', "Wait, this house mine?"
Can't lie, I'm on Angus, Cloud 9
I got 'em on the bandwagon now, 'bout time
I ain't even got no downtime
Every time I speak, she say, "Yeah, that sounds fine"

I been a (G), throw up the (L), sex in the (A.M.), uh-huh
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I can put you in (First class, up in the sky)
I can put you in (First class, up in the s—, up-up in the s—)
I been a (G), throw up the (L), sex in the (A.M.), uh-huh
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I can put you in (First class, up in the sky), mm, mm
I can put you in (First class)28Embed
