4 ContributorsTrippinâ€™ Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, I said yeah nigga, yeah
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
Look, look, look
What the fuck is up?
Heard it's goin' down
Headed to my bitch house on the other side of town
Plus that Remy got my head spinnin' round and round
100 miles per hour and I'm smellin' like a half a pound
Soon as I hit the door, she comin' out her panties
Got a nigga all excited, like I won my first Grammy
I'm a boss mo'fucker, I do it B.I.G.,
Tell King Kong he ain't got shit on me
'87 head to toe, I got that shit on me
And yeah your girl a real rider, she like to sit on me
I told her all the sites zone, you can chill on me
And I don't want your bitch holmes, so you can chill on me
And if the nigga insecure, then you can count on Young
100% guarantee that he won't get sprung
He was blowin' up her phone, she was on my lap
The way she was blowin' a boy, almost forgot my strap

I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', and I don't know why
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', and I don't know why

I'm trippin' 'em all my fault, (okay)
The way I swith it for these hoes they call me flip mode, (why?)
Cause I bust 'em up (okay), then I dig 'em out (alright)
The I roll a spliff (talk to her), then I kick 'em out
Got my rider broad, I ain't bring the kittens out
Cause they get nervous when a nigga bring them splittas out
They say I'm trippin', I say chill baby calm down
So you just standin' there teacher get the man down
That nigga trippin', don't he call himself Young O Day?
Plus I don't play, I let it spray, I'm all about my pay
And if you think I'm trippin' fuck you and bave a nice day
And while you think I'm trippin, I'll be trippin' to the bass

I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', and I don't know why
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', and I don't know whyEmbed
