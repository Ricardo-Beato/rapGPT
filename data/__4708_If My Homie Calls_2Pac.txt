Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochy-coo all through school, you and me, G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope game, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AKs
And though I been around, clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call

But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters), if my homies call
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)

It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was more 'caine
You got fame, now you reign with no shame
I chose rap tracks to make stacks
In fact, I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go, you're not lonely
And I hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend, you can depend on me
Call if you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover?
I'd be no different than the others
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
'Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call

But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters), if my homies call
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
Well, it's '91 and I'm living kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell, pal
But life making records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homie is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine-to-five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take my place or fall from grace
The bullet's late, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on
No matter who the foe, they must fall
Us against 'em all, I'm down to brawl if my homies call

But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters), if my homies call
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters), if my homies call
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters)
But if you ever need a place to stay
Well, alright, y'all (Brothers and sisters), if my homies call19Embed
