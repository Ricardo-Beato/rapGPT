Pop it baby (Pop it baby), don't keep me waiting (Keep me waiting)
Be my lover (Gon' be my lover), be my lady (Be my lady)
Other people (Other people), drive me crazy (Drive me crazy)
Really got me thinking about your body (About your body)

I know it was your birthday (I know it was your birthday)
I know I didn't call right away (Right away)
I know it hurt you in the worst way (I know it hurt you in the worst way)
I know that I would change it all if you stay (If you stay)
I know I'm not perfect (I know I'm not perfect)
I know that everybody ain't (Everybody ain't)
But if it's one thing I know that I know
I know nothing at all (I know nothing at all)
You don't pick up when I call (You don't pick up when I call)
I'll make it up by tomorrow (I'll make it up by tomorrow)
You know that love is a brawl
So I'll be fighting for you, I'll be fighting for you

Pop it baby (Pop it baby), don't keep me waiting (Keep me waiting)
Be my lover (Gon' be my lover), be my lady (Be my lady)
Other people (Other people), drive me crazy (Drive me crazy)
Really got me thinking about your body (About your body)

Can I hit it in the morning? Can I hit it in the night?
If I told you that I love you, would you know it was a lie?
Pretty woman, how you function with the devil in your thighs?
I see heaven in your eyes, I love to see you cry
The drugs inside your mind got you thinking different
Why you hiding from me? Fuck your inhibitions
Why you crazy lover? Think that you should be my baby-mother
Let me slow it down, think I'm kinda tripping

Pop it baby (Pop it baby), don't keep me waiting (Keep me waiting)
Be my lover (Gon' be my lover), be my lady (Be my lady)
Other people (Other people), drive me crazy (Drive me crazy)
Really got me thinking about your body (About your body)

Ass fat, can I take it out them jeans? Lemme know
Church bells sing, wedding rings? Lemme know
Baby girl, I'm ready—what you ready for? Lemme know
Fuck the fussing, fighting, we should let it go, lemme know
Feeling like I need you; I need for you to lemme know
Nothing come between us, I need for you to lemme know
Everybody looking for that special soul—is it you?
If you think it's true, need you, lemme know, baby lemme know

If you feeling right, you can spend the night
We can go anywhere you like, nothing got a price
I suppose that you wasn't quite the type who be doing it
For sure, we can keep it on the low, take a load off
Soon as you walk up in the room, take your clothes off
Bed to the floor, baby, you know how it go
Nothing less and nothing more than what we make it
Consummating for a long time 'til the condom breaking
Conversations in my head about some head
You got some commentary for a nigga?
I ain't tryna be too forward with you, looking forward to you
Tryna split a couple kids, maybe mortgage with you
Do it all to get you, so just lemme know

Pop it baby (Pop it baby), don't keep me waiting (Keep me waiting)
Be my lover (Gon' be my lover), be my lady (Be my lady)
Other people (Other people), drive me crazy (Drive me crazy)
Really got me thinking about your body (About your body)
I'ma let you know that I got that dope
But if you take a toke
You gon' be running 'round tripping
'Til you get your hands on more, yeah
You gotta be certain
Before you consider fucking me
'Cause you hit this shit once
I know you gon' be in love with me21Embed
