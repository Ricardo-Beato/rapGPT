Uzi (Yeah)
Pink Tape
Lil Uzi
(Bugz Ronin, he gon' run it up)
Yeah
I sold my soul for Chrome Heart mixed with Carhartt (What?)
Yes, I'm splashin' in fashion, I can't take no loss (Loss)
I rock Junya on wannabes, I got no heart (Heart)
I put Endless to denim on rims on my car (Skrrt, woah)
I got a Republican doctor (Yeah)
Made my ass great again, MAGA (Woah)
Know you mad now, enchilada
When bitches test me, it get messy like soccer
I sold my soul for Chrome Heart mixed with Carhartt (Woah)
Yes, I'm splashin' in fashion, I can't take no loss
I rock Junya on wannabes, I got no heart (No wannabe)
I put Endless to denim on rims on my car (Skrrt)
I got a Republican doctor (Ah)
Made my ass great again, MAGA
Bitch, don't make me rag you, pasta
I'm numbеr one, you could only be dolce, Gabbana

I got a Chinеse girl, yeah, she from Shanghai (Ni hao)
She goes to Parsons in New York, got good eye
I know I love her, only saw her two times
I met her at Dover Street Market, good eye
You might also like
Ayo, even if my name was Natalie Nunn
You bitches still couldn't chin-check me
That's word to Chanel, they ain't nothin' to see
Bitches on TV channelin' me
Harajuku Barbie, Roman Zolanski
From Red Ruby to Chun-Li
I put door knocker earrings in Fendi (Oh)
Then stamped the trench coat Burberry
Where the C-O-M-P-E-T-I-T-I-O-N? Don't see any (Oop)
Sittin' under stars in the city lights (City lights)
Baby daddy tell me I got pretty eyes (Pretty eyes)
Bitches only eatin' when I dust crumbs (Dust crumbs)
I stay with that Uzi, I'm his plus one (Oop)
I was really in the field with Karl Lager' (Oop)
And now it's Heaven campaigns (R.I.P.)
Check in with Dapper Dan when I'm in Harlem
My niggas'll blow like Virgil
I got that duffel (Heard you), mm
Ooh
Everything we do, you motherfuckers do it too
Heavy on it, tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick too
Everything we do

These rappers can't dress, yeah, they just be hatin'
I never ratted, but got all the statements
Stopped wearing Kapital 'cause it got basic
I still wear Kapital, Uzi, stop fakin'
I used to wear more Number (N)ine than Asians
I mix the Greg Lauren, Purple Label
My closet too cluttered, clothes on my table
We wore that VLONE 'til it turned faded
Yeah, I'm the reason why niggas wear them Goyard bags (Yeah)
It was niggas doing it, but I brought that shit to the hood (I started that shit)
And I made that shit all good (I started that shit)
They stalkin' my swag, stalkin' my swag

I sold my soul for Chrome Heart mixed with Carhartt (Woah)
Yes, I'm splashin' in fashion, I can't take no loss
I rock Junya on wannabes, I got no heart
I put Endless to denim on rims on my car (Skrrt)
I sold my soul for Chrome Heart mixed with Carhartt (Yes)
Yes, I'm splashin' in fashion, I can't take no loss (No)
I rock Junya on wannabes, I got no heart
I put Endless to denim on rims on my car13Embed
