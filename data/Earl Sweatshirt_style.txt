I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judgin' by the pants and the mall grip
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga (Cut that bitch off!)
Night life livin'
Ridin' in the Jeep, I'mma side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? That's alright nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isn't
Right got the whip and I ain't got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it (Cut that bitch off!)
The nicest doin' it, who the fuck you staring at?
Acting like you've never seen a tooth that's carat-capped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin' these niggas gon' flop like Divac
See that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that nigga

Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fuckin' flow that's-s so belittles, man
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas – nigga, listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it – in turn, these critics and interns
Admittin' the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces
Writ, it affixed, learnin' them digits and simultaneously
Dispellin' one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fuckin' six-nigga energy
And crawlin' down 'fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shoutin', thrashin', these niggas done let the kraken out

Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga

Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Ha, vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, mama and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, uh, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezel stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea-kettle songs

And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you

And if I hurt you, I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas

I paid my thoughts no attention
'Cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But Mama wasn't havin' it

Yup, yup, that's right
I'm runnin' things, I'm runnin' things

Hold me down, hold me up
Hold me close 'cause my times is up
Show they true colors, don't know who to trust
Mind workin' like the water when it rush
Growin' from my father, bitter to his touch
Now I'm solely honor, livin' is a must
All this for my momma 'til I'm dust
God gon' deal the karma, lost my trust
Sayin' "Every man know many men"
Got me in a jam, I be in my feelings
On the other hand, I just need a moment
Offer my condolence, smokin' 'til the mornin'

Brodie on the corner with a piece on his hip
Give a warning 'fore you blow it in the sky
Tiptoein' over mortar and the brick
Bumpin' shoulders with the devil in disguise
Shoulder-level water on the rise
Twist, 40s in the morning in the winter
I heard you got your sauce at the Enterprise
Evidently, it was rented but it's mine
Evidently, it was written like Nas
I was in the kitchen with that nigga Mike
Gotta listen when I tell ya simmer down
Two years I've been missin', livin' life
You was wildin', every day was trash
Crackers pilin' in to rape the land
Early morning, wash my swollen hands
Hit the showers, cleanse my soul and crash
Tiptoein' over glass, brodie go too fast, told him slow up
Know I use too much of everything at hand
Except the difference is now I control it, I be
In the crib and in the moment, stuck sippin' out the flask
Feet up on the dash, I hit the spliff but don't promote it
Under overpass, no cap
Sand fallin' out the hourglass
Grand total, it's a whole lotta raps
Quicksand, scramblin' outta that
Go behind the back, switch hands
The fare's high, niggas know they outta wack
Sterilize your clique, paralyze maritime niggas when
Every time Wavy Don tappin' in
Savion Glover caught a couple Ls

I'm as stiff as rock man. Come along the—
We roam tundras
The boy been gone a few summers too long from road runnin'
Trunk full of old hunnids
Of course my old lover was scorned, we grow from it
Don't tell me they don't hunt us for sport, I chose substances
No cuddles, the bases is all covered
Niggas come in the door and smoke somethin'
Choke up on the slugger from home run-ins
Nigga it's on, chest thump, his head thump on the floor
We pressed up on the boy, no more bluffin'
Cold summers, don't tussle with strangers
Some of those keep one in the chamber
Three spliffs had my wing tips clipped, I was stuck in a hangar, nigga
Muffle my pain and muzzle my brain up
Really, I'm just makin' sure my promise is kept
Chuck a deuce if you know it's the end
Kept the truth in my palm and my chest
See it through, keep a noose hangin' off of my neck

We on the loose, niggas know what it is

Cop piff, inhale and cough, rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick and playing cautious

I'ma show you how it's done right, nigga
Drop this when the sunlight gone
Better run right home when the sky turn black
Screaming "Fuck Five-O" 'til my line go flat
In a ash-gray Bimmer—we'll be callin' that the pigeon coupe
Jackknife bitches to the couches in they living rooms
Ask who the best and I doubt that they picking you
Back like how I need to style, I invented you (Yup)
Act like you don't know the name
Only time I ain't eating when the chocha stanky
Listening to "Pre," getting throat while I lane-switch
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky
The poster child, you're 'posed to hate me
Bold and wild, you broke and angry, my nigga
Name getting bigger than the difference between us
Niggas is fake, I limit the features I give 'em
Sweat (Sweat) shirt (Shirt)
You know you famous when the niggas that's around you switch
And if they hated in a passive tense
Now, they hound your dick, and you ain't ask for this
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of a hundred fucking thousand kids
Who you can't get mad at when they want a pound and pic
'Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick
And they the reason that the paper in your trouser's thick
I said, Sweat (Sweat) shirt (Shirt)
You can tell the Reaper I'ma meet him when he send for me
With a cleaver and a 30 and some twisted weed
I pick one and let the crimson leak, nigga (Nigga)

And how I probably smashed every bitch that I passed in the club
And the last couple months was the worst 'cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months that we had as a couple
My absence of fucks was a problem that we ain't ever really get to solve
We just smashed and we scuffled
Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you
Now you're taking all your property back and it's obvious that
That, apart from the fact that we fuck, and it's bomb
Man, I hate when you home

Chef Sweaty braising your faculty (Yuh)
Face getting gray from the ash, but I'm laughing (Yuh)
That's the trace in me, nigga
Fuck out my face while I'm thinking
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute
My days numbered (Yeah)
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em
Feel like I'm the only one pressing to grow upwards
Still, "Fuck you and whoever you showed up with"
Tryna see an end and some steadier hands (Yup)
Who you calling your mans? (Huh)
Bet you thought he was solid
When he really just sand, washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August, in the wake of that August
Last autumn, the leaves fell, and I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribed faith, never called 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in the faucet (Yeah)

And I don't know who house to call home lately

Toe to toe with the foes, new and old

Raised neck-and-neck with Nak, so I’m a fluent brawler
Rain-checking on your plot if ever bread should pop up
Out the toaster, I gotta focus, my family problems
Shrunk and widened with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt 'cause I can’t keep a date or put personal time in
Or reverse to the times when my face didn’t surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile, never change, I’m stupid for trying
Still just too busy wilding (Still, yeah)

Gorgeous, chrome-plated horse whip
Home, making paintings for poor-quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swinging like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good Lord, walk light like the floor slick
Look bored, hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion, endorsing his own importance
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating, crisp spit
Fist clenched, emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle-age and limp-stick
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium
Heavy as insurance off a spanking-new laser gun
Crazy heart, hazy lung, making art, raking funds
Crowd going dumb like Palin's son, ugh

Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
And who was useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga, cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early Man, you posers know me as the troll
Throwing moldy donut holes at your grody ho from his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take ‘em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over tracks
Damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is
Missiles to the picket fence
Who spit as good as finger-lickin’, bitch?
Bet it's thirty-six fish netted like the hook was inefficient

Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Mama taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga
I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
If you step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it don't give a fuck
Pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel, we had females coming every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately, I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob
Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand, steady handling my job
Time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface

If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him

Critics pretend they get it, and bitches just don't fuck with him
I spent the day drinkin' and missin' my grandmother, just
Grab a glass and pour some cold white wine in it
Or Colt .45 in it—you know how I get it

Heavy-handing tracks until the day the fucking train come

Kiwis couldn't take us, boy, I'm jogging around these bases
Niggas' pitches need to change, I separated from my main one
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face-fuck
I been like this since the Motorola Razr
What a bastard that baby was
Little mad nigga missing dad, never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a nigga's seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga Da$h with me, he sipping on some maple leaf
I'm only happy when there's static in the air 'cause the fairweather fake to me
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never bitches funny, boy

You desire a stable home, I acquire fame at naming hoes
Contemplating ways of getting dome
Plotting on my neighbors
Asking God for favors, guess He isn’t home
Probably 'cause that fucking faith, I didn't show
Skipping church, flip the work
Hit the dirt like Tommy Drummond, bitch
Grew up in a home that my papa wasn’t in
Came up off of work that my conscience wasn't in
Either way, it goes, a lot is getting hit
And if it wasn’t hoes, then it probably was a lick
Got burners on my soul, and my posse on my skin
Sweaty, D-A-Dolla, top lotto picks

Face-drinking smoker, it help me duck when emotion jab
Fame is the culprit who give me drugs without owing cash

Sipping 'til I melt, Devil trying me, I'm dodging
Falling victim to myself, middle finger to the help

Now, it's like bruised face, loose walk, too sauced
Distraught thoughts on my corpse on the asphalt
Back when I’d slack off, rock my slacks of my ass half-off
Every time I rap, I blast off
Back when I catch court I always had sports
Dipping on cops in my track shorts

Light leak through the leaves on familiar tracks
I know it's real even when I'm feeling bad
Resilient as they built the black
She shimmy into the—yeah, that's consent gettin' established
You only trash if you trash, I keep it simple and dynamic
Trust the passage rites to life's chapters
I have to write to find balance
This game of telephone massive
I do what I have to with the fragments
The madness method rampant these days, I let the panic pass me
Featherweight, my heart was straight despite baggage
Asymptomatic, but I get sick of the delays—faster, faster
Practicing practice in what I preach, keep pace
The calcium on my teeth fade
Streets are blazed with the anger complacency and deceit create
Ice sheet break, I couldn't weave weight
All I could say to the times that I couldn't freeze-frame, bleak fate
You got so much to bleed to clean-slate (I've got so much of my—)
The bag of tricks in my sleeve breaks
Southpaw under the North Star, forcing all the league changes
(I've got so) Don't sleep late
I, I've got so much
I, I've got so much
I, I've got so much

Strong spirit where the body couldn't get asylum
The cost of living high, don't cross the picket line and get the virus
Wild cat has got 'em in a bind, stay inside
Know I came from out the thicket smilin'
Mad hatters cappin' every line
It doesn't matter to the ten of five
They start hackin' when they can't shrink us
I found the middle in a bit of balance
Fever in the cabin
I knew where we was headed
I ain't countin' no blessings, I sure as shit could measurе
Blinkin' for some feasible mеthods to free yourself
Split it with my hand like cigarill's
Slick oil in a fish' gill
I fill a void with the pen, feel the fear, shrill
Couple stains that I couldn't shield
My brother, Brain, that we couldn't shield
Couple came, couple went still
And what remain of the wolves, nil
I held the page, gave the book ears
Whispered "Thanks", hella pain, heavy rain in the Catskills

Pressure blow the lid, factor in the overhead

Cover me, I'm going in

So really, art is what is happening at a particular time of a people's development or underdevelopment, you see. So I think, as far as Africa is concerned, music cannot be for enjoyment, music has to be for revolution. Really working with the people, enlightening the people and doing your duty as a citizen to play music and act and do something about the system. If you feel bad about it, do something about it2Embed
It would be simple, wouldn't it?
My father was away trapping
Watch lives
What happened to you?
Magic
What's magic?

Out with the vision myself
I had to fend for myself
I get the green like it's kelp
I put that shit in the pail
Make sure my momma do well
All of my bitches do well
All of my bitches do well
My bitches shine like jew-els
I get that cash through the wire
I make 'em plays on the cell
I free my sister out cell
I got that check through the mail
Jupiter, jumbo, or giant
Whippin' that paint, jambalaya
I held your ho with a spell
I put that bitch on the trail
Hopе I be smoking the finest
Running thе game like a tyrant
Winter when nothing else fails
Winter still bringing you hell
Simply sin for me, bitch, sing a symphony
Bitch just defending me, she thought that this was skin-deep
Been took your bag, been told you that you been weak
Been had the mag, been on the line, assembly
Tragedy in the street
Lookin' for someone to laugh with me, incomplete
Lookin' for someone to match with me, Desert Eagle
Lookin' for someone that blast for me, Desert Eagle
Lookin' for someone to fly with me, get high with me, no Visine
Just see what my eyes see, open my eyes, free me
Just remind me where I'm from and what's going on
What's happening? The gas going, the motor flowing
Bitch, what's happening? Remind me where I'm from
And what's happening? The motor going, the gas flowing
Bitch, what's happening?

I would do anything to make my children happy
Please, black girl, is there anything you can do to help me?
Maybe there is... (Magic)
How can I make our Black children happy without any magic?
It depends upon what you tell them
Magic is only make-believe and our children do not need to grow up in a make-believe world. You need to tell them the truth and help make them feel proud of who they are. The magic of truth is much more powerful than magic of make-believe
But what can I tell them?
Tell them that they're beautiful. Tell them that they're Black
Here, take hold of my wing, and I will take you to someone who can give you something even better than magic13Embed
Yep, yep, yep

Same one that I forgot to praise still above me
One thing about it, I'ma beat 'em to the punches
Stumped all day, thinkin', "Mama, where the love went?"
With every triplet of trips around the sun, some of the sludge get thicker
I'm chippin' away at crust
Hold your head, your shit is in for a whole 'nother bust
Roamin' the citadel, on foot eleven when the spliff gave me a rush
Play in the cuts like a DJ
Let me know if you wanna tangle with some
Lemon meringue, Wallabees sole stained gum
Explorin' a couple different avenues and stayin' dangerous, day drunk, yeah
Sometimes the pain sit and fester into hate, beloved
I'm workin' on it
It's worth the time
Further down the line
Might realize
What's yours obviously mine
Toss the sword back into the vines
Callin' out for Lord, lookin' low and high
Finally found it at the core of my dimming fire
What's a little lie? What's a little lie?

Rolling with the pack, even when it switch
Guarantee you miss, don't get too attached
Heavy weight on my back
Chamberlain with the stats
Don't play with it, sailing the land
Niggas stay with the plan, we anchored in
When I get the thrax, I'm inhaling
I happen to know the assailant
I'm happy to throw off the trail
Cover your nose, it's surveillance
I know it's a quota to fill
Where you going and what's your intent?
I ain't notice the run of the mill
I ain't known for hugging the fence
Head hard, I'm stubborn as shit
Quick start, can't cover the steps

These days, I'm mindful of what I embrace
Operating on an empty tank, spank me, fumes fueling a flame
My grandfather spoke thirteen languages
Somehow never had nothing to say to Boot Raymond
Sensed hazel, made sense of it through prayer
Booze is a fool's fragrance
Ipeleng, the glue that saved us
Through his brain getting chipped away at daily
His body on a road, where his mind flailing, funeral wailings
No beluga, no Bob, just mood swingin'
True pain, I couldn't eat or sleep for seven days
Maimed me, I ain't weak

Seeping into the mulch, I needed a quick result

Fire leaping out the hole
Deep breathing only make it grow
Ain't wanna leave the clutch (Clutch)
Far be it for me to plead with y'all
Hit, leanin' into the crutch
Speedin' through the lulls
Take heed, we took an oath to the sword
The shield took a couple chinks but it never broke
I know what he mean, how I play it based on what I'm shown
Consolidate the cream, then I'm headed home
She ain't shine like fourteen karat gold, rewiring
Patchin' holes
It's no rewinding, for the umpteenth time, it's only forward
Peace to AKAI SOLO, the soldier
I couldn't toast a drink to demise, I heard the clink
Life could change in the blink of an eye, I'm wrinklin' time

Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work

It's probably been 12 years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly, I miss this nigga, like, when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it, I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze, cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened
It's evident in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at

Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, "I like attention"
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, "Thanks so much," you made my life harder
And the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
