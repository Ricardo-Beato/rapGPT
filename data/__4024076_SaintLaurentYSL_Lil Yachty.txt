25 ContributorsSaintLaurentYSL Lyrics
Earl on the beat

I did Saint Laurent when that shit was YSL
I've been runnin' shit since I was the age of 12
Since a young nigga, been a hard-headed hot-head
Duck feds, lay low (brr), they do what I say so

I been gettin' money since I learned how to walk for real
I see the haters throwin' shots, but they just talkin' still
I done came, oh so far from when I used to have to walk and steal
13, 14 we was really runnin' 'round with them Glocks for real
Poppin' pills

We don't get no sleep 'til the mornin' (Mornin')
I whip my dick out when she yawn (Yawn)
I'm on the tour bus, I've been tourin' (Tourin')
I think I'm gonna cop me a foreign (Foreign)
I want a white 488, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I came off from sellin' four 48s, yeah (Yeah)

I came off from scammin' and swipin'
Steal from my neighbor, I'm triflin'
Finna go cop me a raptor
Ride that lil' bitch like a bison
New Chanel boots, shawty look like she hikin'
I'm takin' her likin', y'all textin', I'm pipin'
I feel like a viking, I'm all with the shits
Shotgun shell turn his head to grits

I did Saint Laurent when that shit was YSL
I've been runnin' shit since I was the age of 12
Since a young nigga, been a hard-headed hot-head
Duck feds, lay low (brr), they do what I say so

I been gettin' money since I learned how to walk for real
I see the haters throwin' shots, but they just talkin' still
I done came, oh so far from when I used to have to walk and steal
13, 14 we was really runnin' 'round with them Glocks for real
Poppin' pills

Still duckin' Feds 'cause I heard they lookin' for me (For me)
Got a hundred Dracos in the hood, I run up, homie (Homie)
Walk around with all this jewelry on
They will not take it from me (From me)
And them packs came from the West Coast
That's how we get the monies (Monies)

No cap, get 'em, got 'em, gone
Give a dog a bone
Young nigga, fly shit, thank God I'm on
Nigga real respected, all good in all zones
I'm feelin' the energy, even my enemy's
I did Saint Laurent when that shit was YSL (Lil Boat)
I've been runnin' shit since I was the age of 12
Since a young nigga, been a hard-headed hot-head
Duck feds, lay low (brr), they do what I say so

I been gettin' money since I learned how to walk for real
I see the haters throwin' shots, but they just talkin' still
I done came, oh so far from when I used to have to walk and steal
13, 14 we was really runnin' 'round with them Glocks for real
