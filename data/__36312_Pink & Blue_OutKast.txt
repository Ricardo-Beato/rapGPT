Age ain't nothin' but a number, nothin' but a number
Age ain't nothin' but a number, nothin' but a number
Age ain't nothin' but a number, nothin' but a number
Age ain't nothin' but a number, number, number, number–ber
Pretty pink, baby blue
(Why don't) Why don't you teach me something new?
(We're all) We're all just babies in my view
So crawl, baby, crawl, baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
(Why don't) Why don't you teach me something new?
(We're all) We're all just babies in my view
So crawl, baby, crawl, baby

Miss Lady, you could have been born a little later—but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs?
Same here, and, actually, I think that's funky
(In a Claire Huxtable-type of way)
Miss Lady—it looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
Call me when that big ol' house gets lonely-fied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun
You might also like
Pretty pink, baby blue
(Why don't) Why don't you teach me something new?
(We're all) We're all just babies in my view
So crawl, baby, crawl, baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
(Why don't) Why don't you teach me something new?
(We're all) We're all just babies in my view
So crawl, baby, crawl, baby

You're sophisticated
Just me and Miss Lady
You've got me talkin' like a baby (You make me talk baby talk)
(Baby talk) She's sophisticated (You make me talk baby talk)
Just me and Miss Lady (She makes me talk baby talk)
You got me talkin' like a baby, like "ga-ga" and "goo-goo"
Oh, mo-mmauhhhhhhh, yeah
You're sophisticated (You make me talk baby talk)
Just me and Miss Lady (You're so experienced)
You got me talkin' like a baby (Teach me somethin' new)
Teach me somethin' new
You're sophisticated
Just me and Miss Lady
You got me talkin' like a baby
Sophisticated
Just me and Miss Lady7Embed
