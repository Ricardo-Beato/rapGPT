5 ContributorsStill Life Lyrics
A lotta pain
Been shooting from the sky
And the tears they fall
Hot like flame don't know why
But still life
Still life finds a way to look gorgeous
And you still look gorgeous, darling
Even though it's all coming to an ending
The whole thing look pretty like a painting

Uh, alright, uh, alright
Uh, alright, uh, okay
Uh, alright, uh, alright
Uh, alright, uh, okay

Until the end of time, that's what we said
Never woulda guessed that there wasn't much time left
There's no precedent to represent it
Might as well have thought that we would float away like dust in the sunset
I wanna put you on the back of my bicycle
And push like I'm peddling the circle of life with you
The sky's falling let me strike all the personal strife
And try to be the best version of the person you like
You might also likeYou know the plan we exist to resist
Just hold my hand till it falls off my wrist
Poison in the well, airborne contagions
Government surveillance and home invasions
We been predicting Armageddon ever since the beginning
Something in weather, something in the war
We been pretending that time's never-ending
This must be how it feels when there's something to live for

A lotta pain
Been shooting from the sky
And the tears they fall
Hot like flame don't know why
But still life
Still life finds a way to look gorgeous
And you still look gorgeous, darling
Even though it's all coming to an ending
The whole thing look pretty like a painting

Do you recall if all of it always felt so out of control
I don't know, but maybe this is simply how it's supposed to go
And if it's still possible
Maybe we should slow down and watch the show
It's like the world's on fire
On top of that my love feels like fire, sirens and flashing lights
I realize this ain't the time to lie you down now
'Cause we should probably find some higher ground now
In the event that this is truly the apocalypse
I don't wanna miss that midnight kiss
If we both still alive when we arrive on the other side
Then forever we can be by each other's side
It's like a bowl full of plastic fruit, paint a picture
The truth never needed an attitude to convince you
Even at your funeral, something's trying to kill you
You always look beautiful to me and you still do

A lotta pain
Been shooting from the sky
And the tears they fall
Hot like flame don't know why
But still life
Still life finds a way to look gorgeous
And you still look gorgeous, darling
Even though it's all coming to an ending
The whole thing look pretty like a paintingEmbed
