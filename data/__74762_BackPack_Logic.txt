I'ma just go in on this joint right now for y'all
All my lyricism heads where y'all at?

I spit fifties and shit hundreds, do shit that's undid
Spontaneously combust in these bitches guts
I get 'em wet, no need to touch
Break they back like dutches
Keep em close like the toast I clutch
Never the less, I'm never depressed
I keep feelings suppressed
One of the best but need to listen if I'ma progress
I'm ready to live, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to ride for rap
I said it on a record, now I can't take it back
Stop, I shut it down like a blood clot
Smoke emcees, like a fuckin bumbaclot
Mic check, I come to catch wreck
Death before dishonor so I'm coming for your neck
I pop emcees like hymens
Y'all glass posing as studs but I'm a diamond
I reckon you need to listen, I'm never dissin'
Unless your shit is wack, I'll beat you into submission
Catch me fishin', cause I'm eating for a lifetime
Wisdom in my mind, I'm a star watch me shine
Fucking your bitch from behind
Record it and hit rewind
I'm nasty, construct rhymes like rhinoplasty
A hip-hop statute, rhymes coming at you
God bless you, when I kick wisdom it never stress you
Or test you unless you a dumb motherfucker
You might also like
We gon' get into it like this...

Said this is mathematic tactics, murder this rap shit
Intravenously inject my prophylactics
Inhale my words like a fresh batch of Vicks
Similar to black ice cause the flow so slick
What's up, rappers hear the rhyme they slit they wrists up
Do a whole lotta talking, no rapping like fisticuffs
Yeah, turn my headphones up
That's all you sayin' but I'm sprayin' and I can't get enough
Raw, rugged and rough, my alter ego Mr. Tough
I'll call your bluff, face to face never snuff
I murder you with predicate poetic balletic shit
No mercy, 'cause if I grip the mic they might curse me
Da Vinci flow,'fore I grip the mic I'm in control
Before I manifested tendons I was rhyming as a embryo
Living in vertigo half of these fuckers don't know
It's Logic, heh, I said it's (Logic)

As you can see my jedi power are far beyond yours6Embed
