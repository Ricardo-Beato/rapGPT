8 ContributorsTonyâ€™s Touch Lyrics
Yo, I be that smooth cat you never seen rollin' with clowns
One of the few from Uptown that's holdin' it down
Bitches be on me like I'm welfare
Even rich whores that live in Bel Air
Is this Big L? Yeah, hell yeah
Word up, I use a chrome gat to push domes back
Watch how you talk when you call me, Feds got my phone tapped
This rap game, I put my life in it
Chain got mega ice in it
Push an Infinite, chrome rims, light-tinted
And you can see pal, it's all about me now
Twenty G's a show, bitch, three thou' just to freestyle
I made this cheese, it didn't grow on trees
Can you hold somethin'? Sure, you can hold on these
Yo I'm fat like a old Cray-on, smooth as Rayon
L is who the ladies stay on, baby play on
I stay jewel-ed up, pockets swelled up
From banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep, in the triple black, dark-tinted o' jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn'
On the block all alone
And put a Glock to his dome
Tell him: Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'mma let this four-fifth spit, and leave your shit split
Prick, it ain't nothin' decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junky, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
And mad niggas be frontin' a lot
Poppin' mad shit, tryin' to be somethin' they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancin'
Don't even look at me, I might break your jaw just for glancin'
I'm sick like Manson
In '97 Harlem kids is blowin'
And we don't trick, we'll let a bitch starve 'til her ribs is showin'You might also likeEmbed
