L Beats

Yeah, I got them hits like I'm Derek Jeter
Only smoking on the rarest reefer
Got a girl, man, I dare to meet her
Producers hate me, always I tear they beat up (I do)
'Member days never rock designer
Now a nigga only shop for finer
Catch me eating at hottest diners
Man that boy Entendre is finest rhymer (Ooh)
I'm going back to my old ways
Don't fuck with haters, they so fake (I don't)
My girl trippin', I go OJ (Sike)
Gang pimpin' we the Coldplay
We all home ain't no free squad (Nah)
Catch us riding in a speed car
Lil dev popping three bars
And you know we all laced in G Star (We do)
Soon gang be Giuseppe steppin'
So I never do the heavy stressing
I swear my mind is a deadly weapon
And I use it just about it in every lesson
I'm on the grind and I'm getting bigger
While they watching, damn these niggas bitter
I hit the stu and you hit the Twitter
Do something that'll get you richer
Never been a hater, I'm an innovator
Girl I'll penetrative you in a minute, ayy
Moving weight that's that fitness, uh
Niggas hate, on some bitch shitYou might also like1Embed
