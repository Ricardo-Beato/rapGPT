22 Contributors06 Gucci Lyrics
(Ambezza did it)
Long ghetto hair on my bitch ('06, yeah, '06), yeah (Yeah)
Ghetto hair on my bitch ('06)
Look like Flare in '06
Long ghetto hair on my bitch (It's Gucci)
Yeah (Go)

Nigga, this that '06 Gucci Mane
My lil' nigga, gone off a pill, the nigga walk around like Superman
Somebody calm him down, he boutta shoot the man
Nigga, this that '06 Gucci Mane
My trunk won't be still, I'ma play the music loud as the music can
You don't like that way I'm ridin'? Catch an Uber then
Yeah, nigga, let's go

Feel like La Flare in '06 (Yeah)
Long ghetto hair on my bitch (Uh-huh)
I came from them, I wasn't shit (What they do?)
Now they sit there and stare at my whip (Okay)
I can't even put it in park (Nah)
Somebody down to get hit (Yeah)
I need somebody carryin' my fifty
She ran over her man, he a jit
And you could throw my bowl on the floor, I'm a dog (Woof, woof), nigga damn near a pit (Woof, woof)
I don't think none of them niggas with it at all (Nah), niggas damn near a bitch (None of these niggas)
Only 'bout winter, spring, summer, fall (Nah) without my hand on the stick (Nah)
And I'll politely pull up in a brand-new car and bend over his bitch (Yeah)

Nigga, this that '06 Gucci Mane
My lil' nigga gone off a pill, the nigga walk around like Superman
Somebody calm him down, he 'bout to shoot the man
Nigga, this that '06 Gucci Mane
My trunk won't be still, I'ma play the music loud as the music can
You don't like that way I'm ridin'? Catch an Uber then
Yeah, nigga, let's go

I feel like it's me in '06 and '07, '08, and even '09 ('09)
Still hard to kill, the last nigga tried, go ask him, he didn't survive (What happened?)
I was sittin' in the county, these niggas off runnin' to help, they ain't send me a dime (Fuck 'em)
These niggas be cap, the way I was trappin', went platinum before I was signed (Signed)
Geeked up, I stayed out of my mind (Geeked)
Still was ahead of my time (Wop)
And I was that man in the middle but made so much profits, you thought it was mine (Skrrt)
And everything top of the line (Top)
And nothin' ain't changed, I'm still in my prime (Brr)
I make it look easy, these niggas some copycats, they'll do whatever to shine (It's Gucci)

Nigga, this that '06 Gucci Mane (Huh?)
My lil' nigga gone off a pill (Yeah), the nigga walk around like Superman
Somebody calm him down, he 'bout to shoot the man (Huh?)
Nigga, this that '06 Gucci Mane (Huh?)
My trunk won't be still, I'ma play the music loud as the music can
You don't like that way I'm ridin'? Catch an Uber then
Yeah, nigga, let's go
21, 21, 21
Pistol whip your mans (21)
She eat the dick with both her hands (21)
Pourin' up Wock', I'm tryna stand (21)
Clap at the opps like I'm a fan (21)
I got a dub for my advance (21)
Hit for a hundred on Moreland Ave
Long live Shawty Lo, bitch, I'm the man (21)
Home invasion, we tryna go loot somethin' (Straight up)
Put his face on the stove, thought he knew somethin' (Straight up)
You a stepper, then go put your boots on (Straight up)
He get hit the K if he move wrong (Straight up)
G block, yeah, I trapped in the school zone (Straight up)
You know I'm the wrong nigga to snooze on (21)
Half a ticket on the Rolex blue stone (21)
Reach for it, face shot, cut the news on, pussy (21, 21)

Nigga, this that '06 Gucci Mane
My lil' nigga gone off a pill, the nigga walk around like Superman
Somebody calm him down, he 'bout to shoot the man
Nigga, this that '06 Gucci Mane
My trunk won't be still, I'ma play the music loud as the music can
You don't like that way I'm ridin'? Catch an Uber then
Yeah, nigga, let's goEmbed
