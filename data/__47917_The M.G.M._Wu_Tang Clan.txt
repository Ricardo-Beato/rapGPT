35 ContributorsThe M.G.M. Lyrics
Yo, up in the M.G.M. coked up, psych!
Six niggas walked in flashing they gems piece
Aight, one dark-skinned nigga, fifty-six inch rope
Wrapped around twice, smash the Gilligan boat with ice
They threw sign language, ordered hot coffee wit' a danish
Relax, whispered they, "Rap entertainers"
Had Lizzy on, two Japanese birds with furs look good, kid
Laid back, handling hors d'ourves
It's like round three, we too black for BET
You memorize the 1 to 40? I'm at the 19th degree
If a civilized person doesn't perform his duty, what shall be done?
Pardon me, God, that nigga got a gun bulging out his sweatpants
Check out his stance
See the side of his grill? Look like my cousin Lance
Left hand, rocky Guess watch, yo, I think I did his Clarks
He wanted crush bone leather with the strings dark
Now I remember, he from Bear Mountain
He and Mitch Greene shot the fair one near the water fountain
Seventh round, Chavez bleeding from his right ear
Yo, keep your eye on that same nigga from right here
Popcorn spilling all on Liz Claiborne
Ghost had the fly Gucci mocks wit' no socks on
Seen Deion Sanders in the back with the phat fur on
Working them hoes with the fly Wu shirts on
Mixed drink session, dun, pour me some more
Chef leathered down, blinking at Chant√© Moore
Tenth round, Chavez tearing 'em down
Sweet Pea, get ya shit off
It's like blacks against the Germans, getting hit off
Smooth and them walked in, Brownsville representing
They sent a bottle over, autograph blessing
Chef, pull out the doo-doo, twist the dank - pink noodles
Yo, about to roll one, matter fact, twist two of those
Yo, they wound up stopping the fight
Steels took a point away from Chavez
