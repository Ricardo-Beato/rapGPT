It's a shame, the way it's goin' down
I'm on the sideline while he's playin' around

The difference between you and I spittin's a wide difference
They hate on you, but me, they want me to die different
No ego, I'm just providin', a better understandin' (It's a sh—)
I don't wish it on nobody who doesn't have the bandwidth (It's a shame, the—)
It come with standin' your ground
When you from a poor town, that generate awareness
The ventilation shifts
Where the air is erased when you hear it (It's a sh—)
Somewhere between great and endearin'
You smell it and taste it 'cause it's serious (It's a shame, the—)
And you don't think it's fair, you feel like you come with bars
And you won some wars, frankly, they should send they regards
Some of the hardest rappers get overlooked and ignored (It's a sh—)
No matter what happen, I hope all of us soar, I go (It's a shame, the—)

Superhero status, no masks, no gadgets
It's a shame, the way it's goin' down
Send them villains at us, we ain't scared of action
I'm on the sideline while he's playin' around
We ain't characters cappin'
Ability to leap buildings, if you blink, you won't catch it
(Audio) dope (Audio) dope
(Audio) dope (Audio) dope
It's a sh—
It's a shame, the—

Always on time, I'm never petty, yeah, I'm always ready
That's why my shit flows smooth and steady, pictures on Getty
I don't complain, I don't blame
Know when my time is done, I move to the side
I don't want nothin' to prove to these guys
If y'all was movin' like Nas
Y'all wouldn't assume someone owe you
Nobody know you when you old 'cept your peoples
That should keep you peaceful (It's a sh—)
Instead, delusional mood illusions refusin' to see truth (It's a shame, the—)
Your personal hurt, you unleash on the first
Person you come across doin' your evil work
Damn (It's a sh—)
It's a shame (It's a shame, the—)

Slugs, blood, laugh, hugs, survive if you could
It's a shame, the way it's goin' down
Downsize, intro the thugs to the plug
And just today, I noticed a different pain
I'm on the sideline while he's playin' around
Man, catch me, don't let me slip in no demented stage

Repetitive Beat Street watcher, a gatekeeper, conqueror
Late night creep sponsor, need a freak who fly and beyond thick
I'm a sheikh, she don't need to fly to Dubai for it (It's a sh—)
Fleet of cars, she under my arm and she honored with it (It's a shame, the—)
Cognizant correspondence, I don't respond to nonsense
Adidas shells, I keep a reefer smell on me
Ringin' the Wall Street bell at 9:30 A.M. is my coffee (It's a sh—)
My gang is New York Stock Exchange
Here's my costume change
Superhero status, no masks, no gadgets
Send them villains at us, we ain't scared of action
We ain't characters cappin'
Ability to leap buildings, if you blink, you won't catch it
(Audio) dope (Audio) dope
(Audio) dope (Audio) dope
It's a sh—
It's a shame, the—

It's a shame, the way it's goin' down
I'm on the sideline while he's playin' around1Embed
