16 ContributorsBetter Get ’Em Lyrics
Ain't nobody like you in this bitch
Woo! Fuck them other niggas
Carter V! Fuck them other niggas
Ain't nobody else like you, ain't nobody else like you
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
You ready?

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Ridin' in a mothafuckin' brand new machine, comin' down like a missile
Machine gun to a nigga spine like, "Listen, nigga listen, don't move, motherfucker"
And the world is mine like Twism, this that Carter V, lemme get 'em

I know the whole New Orleans got my back
Get the dirt off my shoulders and clean up my act
This that C5, thank you Jesus, I'm back
'Cause there's only one I, don't remove that eye patch
Man, I got this whole fuckin' world on my back
It wasn't my hands but there's blood on my hands
Watch my fingers make a capital B
I throw gang signs up and don't care where they land
I know the whole 17 got my back
The backbone of my hood, I'm the spleen of my trap
I know some niggas that think it's Iraq
There is death in the air, you might catch a contact
You may need to shorten the lean after that
Man, I swear I drunk so much of lean, I almost passed
Not tryna say I've been clean after that
But let's just say that is a thing of the past
But can you picture the scene after that?
No more Lil Tunechi, no more king of rap
Life can be gone in a blink of an eye
Lord, I guess I just be blinkin' too fast
Oh but don't you judge me, judge the one in the mirror
In your bathroom found a sink full of glass
Just when they thought and they think I wouldn't last
I woke up and I just Carter Cinco'd they ass
You might also like
Man, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
We done came this far, I'm so proud of my niggas
I'm around for my niggas, I come...6Embed
