4 ContributorsChange the World LyricsWhat can I do, what can I do
To change your situation (what can I do)
What can I do to speak the whole nation
I believe (I believe that I) I can change the whole world
What can I do to make your life much better
What can I do to bring us all together
I believe I can change the world
Snoop, let em hear it
What will I do, what can I say
I pray today is the day
If I can change the world, I'd probably rush your problems away
Find cures for diseases, increasing the peace
And bring the word to the people right here in the streets
So they can fill up their hearts with love, joy, no stressin'
You can hear it, it's the spirit
Yes I'm blessed, oh yes
See he's my Lord and savior
That's probably why I'm blessed and highly favored
What can I doYou might also likeEmbed
