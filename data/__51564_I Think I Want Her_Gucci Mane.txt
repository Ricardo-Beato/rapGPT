10 ContributorsI Think I Want Her Lyrics
I want her, I really want her, I think I want her
Your girl friend has left with me, yeah, she's a goner
And I want her, I really want her, I gots to have her
Now I got her, yeah, Gucci got her, I'm 'bout to smash her
I want her, I really want her, I think I want her
Your girlfriend has left with me, yeah, she's a goner
And I want her, I really want her, I gots to have her
Now I got her, yeah, Gucci got her, I'm 'bout to smash her

Y'all ball when y'all can but I stunt when I wanna
Your girlfriend wanna fuck me, I think we're gonna
Marijuana got my Beamer foggy as a sauna
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, bitch, I'm such a prima donna
I'm East Atlanta shawty but I hang where I wanna
Got a plug in Arizona but used to slang on the corner
Got a chocolate nerdy looking chick, a rider like Wynona
Told her text my celly plenty when she come from California
You are not the owner of that car, that is a loaner
I got money stacks as tall as you 'cause that's just my persona
I got half a million on my neck, come try me if you wanna
Keep a shooter with a chopper, turn you to an organ donor

I want her, I really want her, I think I want her
Your girlfriend has left with me, yeah, she's a goner
And I want her, I really want her, I gots to have her
Now I got her, yeah, Gucci got her, I'm 'bout to smash her
You might also likeI want her, I really want her, I think I want her
Your girlfriend has left with me, yeah, she's a goner
And I want her, I really want her, I gots to have her
Now I got her, yeah, Gucci got her, I'm 'bout to smash her

My flow so schizophrenic that I think I need a straightjacket
Straight drop dope flow, put me in a crack baggy
Old school like a 1960 Cadillac                                                                                      Real well-known in every hood, that's why these nigga's swagga jackin'
Not in my league, nowhere close to my tax bracket
Brick Squad charm bout the same size of a tennis racket
Thirty round tone in my jeans got my pants saggin'
Let yo girlfriend give me becky, now the bitch braggin'
Rims to the white chain to watch hat to the shoes matchin'
Since I'm Gucci Mane might as well buy her some new glasses
Everybody still lookin' at me when my 'Vette passing
Brick Squad CEO, I guarentee the check cashes

I want her, I really want her, I think I want her
Your girlfriend has left with me, yeah, she's a goner
And I want her, I really want her, I gots to have her
Now I got her, yeah, Gucci got her, I'm 'bout to smash her
I want her, I really want her, I think I want her
Your girlfriend has left with me, yeah, she's a goner
And I want her, I really want her, I gots to have her
Now I got her, yeah, Gucci got her, I'm 'bout to smash her
Six stoves in my house and everybody cooking
Ferrari pass by, damn, everybody looking
A couple million dollars up but I'm still straight crooked
You might had the game on hold but I took it
I'm hoppin' out the drop Lambo like a kangaroo
Gucci Brick Squad CEO but tell me, who the fuck is you?
Like Simon Says, yo' big sister do what I tell her to
I tape bricks underneath her tits and then I send her through
Military rifles, you would think I was a ex-marine
SK, street sweeper, Mac-90 or M16
No, I'm not a fighter or a lover, I am just a shooter
So if you disrespect my squad, I will have to shoot ya

I want her, I really want her, I think I want her
Your girlfriend has left with me, yeah, she's a goner
And I want her, I really want her, I gots to have her
Now I got her, yeah, Gucci got her, I'm 'bout to smash her
I want her, I really want her, I think I want her
Your girlfriend has left with me, yeah, she's a goner
And I want her, I really want her, I gots to have her
Now I got her, yeah, Gucci got her, I'm 'bout to smash her1Embed
