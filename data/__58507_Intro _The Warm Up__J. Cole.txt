22 ContributorsIntro (The Warm Up) Lyrics
Yeah
You ever prayed for something your whole life?
I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing
I mean, you know it’s coming
You have faith and all that
But sometimes
Sometimes you second guess yourself
That’s human nature I suppose, second guessing
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups
Seems like it gives you more losses than wins
But do you stand tall and be bold
Or do you fold?
Do you believe?
See, me, I came a long way
Way too far for me to stop now
Not that I would stop anyways, but
I’m so close, I can feel it
Can you feel it?
