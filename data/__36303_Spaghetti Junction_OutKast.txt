Yeah, Spaghetti Junction, yes, yes
Elope, ski slopes (coughs)
Damn, yeah, check it out

Niggas elope wit ski slopes and fall like avalanches
Tootin' like it's cool: he's a fool, and I can't just
Sit around and watch those nose membranes flame
My ends is loose and you can't stop that rain
When it starts to fall
Lookin' like Ms. Pac-Man, hammers and Vogues and cat-man
I'm speaking about these pros 'cause you know nothing bout that, man
The nigga the B-I-G is high and fly like ValuJet
You thinkin' about the beatin', this my ends is never met, nigga
Black man, white man, Jew man, ain't no joke
Remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch
And talk about when we get older; now we up against the ropes
Yeah, they kickin' niggas door down, 'cause it ain't no dope on the streets
And a quarter pound of feet weed, that's all a nigga like me need
Talkin' about that Southern sess, nigga, you all up in that mess
But never shall you test, and never shall you quit
Runnin' up on me with that fuck shit will get you nothin' but dead, nigga

Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home
(In the junction, in the junction)
Don't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce
(Junction, junction)
To all you players play ya brims and you hustla chrome ya rims
'Llac and pimps and macks I love the corners that you bend
Y'all, yes, yes, uhh
(Junction, junction)

Uh, well I'm drankin' on 'gnac while I'm dippin' off in that 'llac ('llac)
The junkies around my way are always smokin' up on that crack
Be layin' them College Park hoes flat on they backs (backs)
Livin' the life of pimps steadily makin' this paper stack
Niggas don't understand the master plan, crumble yo' herb, man
'Til they start kickin' the do' in, then we ready to blast them
Out (Out) like 'Kast ('Kast), we 'bout to crash (crash)
So mayday, may Dré, knock 'em up off they ass boi
We struggle like fat hoes just to get things that those
People got we forgot they always gonna keep a plot
Right up they sleeve you won't believe they deceive like weave
Thieves can't break in your crib and leave in that good life too
So gimme me and then I'm straight, as eight-oh-five
See, blindfolds can't cover three eyes
We wise to the fact so we attack with what we know
Heaven is the only good life, so what you strivin' fo'?

Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home
(In the junction, in the junction)
Don't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce
(Junction, junction)
To all you players play ya brims and you hustla chrome ya rims
'Llac and pimps and macks I love the corners that you bend
Y'all, yes, yes, uhh
(Junction, junction)
Well, like flip-flops and football socks
A nigga be rockin' the mic like birthdays
Lil' Jon and Sercy, so are you worthy?
I'm callin' yo' ass a flawed pimp
Yappin' about this crew you run wit'
Bankhead bouncin' to that dumb shit
So what mo' can you come wit'?
Yeah, they can bite, but cannot be us
They can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us
You ought to be ashamed, trying to fit in my adidas
So Run like D.M.C. is me and, no, don't got no heater
Well, we zippin' around the corner in that golden stankin' Lincoln
I got my heat up under my seat
Just in case these youngsters tryin' to take it
Pullin' the pistol on another black man was never the plot
But sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot
They come like black stallions in the night
Usually around fo' or five is when they figure the time is right
When you good and sleep; I couldn't sleep until I seen it
'Wit my own eyes, 'til they come over the hill—surprise

Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home
(In the junction, in the junction)
Don't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce
(Junction, junction)
To all you players play ya brims and you hustla chrome ya rims
'Llac and pimps and macks I love the corners that you bend
Y'all, yes, yes, uhh
(Junction, junction)5Embed
