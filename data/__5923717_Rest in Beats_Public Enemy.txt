6 ContributorsRest in Beats LyricsRest in beats from Heavy D to Eazy E
The Notorious B.I.G., we have lost so many
Still wonder in my Adidas why
Jam Master Jay had to die and Lisa Left Eye
Off top no rehearsal, R.I.B. salute
Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal, my man
Still in shock of the loss of Afeni & Pac
His spirit lives on, it won't ever stop
Scott LaRock heard a dope story about him from the Blastmasta
Out west R.I.B. Mac Dre & The Jacka
When we die it plants new seeds
For new Big Bank Hank's and new MC Breed's, remember?
And the Sean P's who speak that raw
J Dilla got all beat makеrs still in awe
I'm not a pimp but Pimp C forever UGK
Rеst in beats is they way that we say salute
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on and on and on (Rest in beats)
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on and on and on (Rest in beats)
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on and on and on
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on
You might also likeWe've lost brick and mortar record stores
And really dope diverse tours, R.I.B. Rest in beats
Original flavor and more
We've lost the art of everyone being in the same studio, rest in beats
The love for the art now dipped into dough
We lost real flows to mumbles and memes
We've seem to lost the ideas that we were kings and queens
Where are the groups? Too many going solo
We lost streets, teams, promo, YouTube and Vevo
Man I miss the time when you really had to rhyme
When lines weren't reduced to ghetto studio and crime
For all that we've lost still the essence is preserved
Through beats, sound, stages, dope energy and words (And words)
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on and on and on (Rest in beats)
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on and on and on
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on and on and on and on
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on
Never cared how doves cried till I heard you died
Now I wanna forget and God knows I tried
I wished you heaven, I hoped that you heard me
We were undisputed there was no controversy
Tired of the changes that life seems to bring
Never feared for silence, the dead still sing
And we can celebrate by dancing in the streets
Your music, your legacy, rest in beats
I'm sick of this scenario, man, I'm buggin' out
So let's go, let's get loud, let's shout
Nothing but love, yes, the good die young
Forever finds a way your songs will be sung
September now always got me thinking of you
Remembering hard times you helped me through
It wasn't your move but the way you moved me
Your music, your legacy, rest in beats
Rest in beats, rest in beats, rest in beats, rest in beats
Rest in beats, rest in beats, rest in beats, rest in beats
Rest in beats, rest in beats, rest in beats, rest in beats
Rest in beats, rest in beats, rest in beats, rest in beatsEmbed
