Let the waves carry you down to my doorstep
Rest your weary souls on my shores, yeah
Sand and the sun and the tropical breeze, yeah
You can get away from the sharks in the seas, yeah

Wild out, make a name
Stars is out, freaky time
Sink the ship, take a dip
Coconut, take a sip
Wildfire, dance around
Wear my gold like a crown
Where we've been, given doubt
Where we are? In the wild now

Wild beach
Can't control these wild things
Can't you see you're drowning?
Tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach
It's like you're tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach
I'm a wild beach, I'm a wild beach

Boy, you must be crazy
Must be out of my mind
Feel like I'm stranded but it go hand in hand
'Cause we free to live that life
Now see that though
Pretty in a drop top, we gon' blow
Palm trees in a Backwood, he on both knees
Make it pop-pop, I don't need no doors
If crib pop-itty, I don't need more hoes
See no evil even if she won't go
Dijon chico with the neon coat
Got a vision of the sun, I just see more gold and

Wild out, make a name
Stars is out, freaky time
Sink the ship, take a dip
Coconut, take a sip
Wildfire, dance around
Wear my gold like a crown
Where we've been, given doubt
Where we are? In the wild now

Wild beach
Can't control these wild things
Can't you see you're drowning?
Tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach
It's like you're tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach
I'm a wild beach, I'm a wild beach

Every day it feels like the weekend
Every day could be summer season
Relax your mind with me all weekend
Under jungle, roll in my leaves, yeah
Every day it feels like the weekend
Every day could be summer season
Relax your mind with me all weekend
Under jungle, roll in my leaves, yeah
