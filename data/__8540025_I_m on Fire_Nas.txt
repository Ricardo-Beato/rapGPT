Uh
Woke up this morning on some white linen sheets
The bed almost caught ablaze
The temperature's one hundred in the room
I'm like "What's up?"

Still got the same flame behind me from the "Hate Me Now" video
It's continual, all I need is a beat and I'm stitchin' you
Like stitchin' these words together, how I'm still getting better
I'm finding more gold as I dig in the dirt with a shovel
I got the last laugh, don't get blown away by the backdraft

(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm on firе) Don't be scared now
(I'm, I'm on fire) Givin' 'еm hell now (He's on fire!)
I'm startin' to see 'em sweat
(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm, I'm on fire) I'm givin' 'em hell now

Tryna walk in my soles is like bare feet on hot coals
Soon as I start heatin' up, the whole block froze
I came in without an ordinary name, how many Nasirs?
How many top tier? How many not here?
There's something in the name that's different from theirs
Depicted in scripture holdin' two dragons blowin' flames
Sorry it ain't go the same for y'all
They say Allah, please explain Allah
You Godbody or do you praise Allah?
And still rock crosses all on your chain a lot
I'm scorchin' and I never forced it
Even when forces and powers that be went against me
Y'all use that as an excuse, you dudes cannot convince me
Or trick me out my spot, y'all want my shit like Sherman Hemsley
I'm debunking the blackball myth, the facts more or less
I might hurt your feelings but, yo, sometimes it actually is
Victimization, mix that with some entitlement
It's bound to explode
I make 'em stop, drop, and roll, move to the side with it
There's no stoppin' it, I'm rap's arsonist

(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm, I'm on fire) Givin' 'em hell now (He's on fire!)
I'm startin' to see 'em sweat
(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm on fire) Don't be scared now
(I'm, I'm on fire) I'm givin' 'em hell now

I must say I am what I am
(I'm on fire) They said I wouldn't survive, look at me, damn
(I'm on fire) Like the tip of the barrel that's on a wham
(I'm on fire) He's on fire, NBA Jam
I was all, I was alone like, you know
I was making some moves
I need to, like, concentrate and chill but
I was, I was just getting all these calls and everything
And it's telling me like, "You on fire"3Embed
