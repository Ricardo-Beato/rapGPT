8 ContributorsCanâ€™t Get the Best of Me Lyrics(Sen Dog)
Hell nah, you can't handle a man of my superior strength
I've been rockin for years, now it's time to go to length
Bitin emcees in their tracks I stop em
My rhyme style make em turn dropper
My concepts come sick like Dennis Hopper
I jack fools up and stick em like dirty coppers
Like I said before I'm takin you lane of whores
Down to the phone, knock his ass on your good balls
Only one way to deal with these softies
Take they ass out like heroes and they flossin
And when you test me you better bring styles
Cause mine can go on and on and on for miles
(Chorus)
(B-Real & Sen Dog)
You can't get the best of me
Can't get the best of me
You can't get the best of me
Can't get the best of me
You can't get the best of me
Can't get the best of me
You can't get the best of me
Can't get the best of me
YOU CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't hold me down)
CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't, you can't hold me down)
YOU CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't, you can't hold me)
CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't, you can't hold me down)
YOU CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't hold me down)
CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't, you can't hold me down)
YOU CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't hold me down)
CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't, you can't hold me down)

Five roll with the weakest
What you need is, the chrome plated heater
So you can peep this, tragedy had to be in your mind soakin in
Sad to see you broken down, not at least broken in
Can't stop some Hill shit from comin through
The reality is out with the old, and with the new
Ways and things change, with strange haids of braids shade
Switch place life and life plays with thumb pay
Does and un-trues, the mule leaves no clues
In the dark confused, we choose to eat you
Out the whole stroke away so I can listener
We don't stop if you can, fuck commissioner
(Chorus)
(B-Real & Sen Dog)
You can't get the best of me
Can't get the best of me
You can't get the best of me
Can't get the best of me
You can't get the best of me
Can't get the best of me
You can't get the best of me
Can't get the best of me
YOU CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't hold me down)
CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't hold me down)
YOU CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't, you can't hold me)
CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't, you can't hold me down)
YOU CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't, you can't hold me down)
CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't hold me down)
YOU CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't hold me)
CAN'T GET THE BEST OF ME (you can't hold me down)

Nigga get up on a rhymin apparatus
Takin out crews who think they are baddest
Mad dog Sen for real is the maddest
Fuck you punk and your A&R status
I stay in a zone though I'm never alone
B-Real got my back checkin at your dome
So when it comes down to who's (Spanish)
I'm down for the pound and slangin the (Spanish)
(Spanish) I break (Spanish)
Gonna make a move and smoke your fuckin hot-show
Remove that sucker and that wack-ass shit
Cause every time I see he's actin like a bitch
So let's get it straight I smoke the competition
Breakin down fools in my motherfuckin mission
One by one they'll all come out missin
You can't fuck with this here kid I AIN'T BITCHIN
(Chorus)
(B-Real & Sen Dog)
