Uh

Shawty go joggin' every morning (Every morning)
And she make me breakfast almost every morning (Every morning)
And she take a naked pic before she leave the door
I be wakin' up to pics before a nigga yawnin'
And every weekend my shawty comin' over (Over)
Shawty could Fendi out, but she like Fashion Nova (Nova)
She ain't drivin' no Camry, she pullin' in a Rover (Rover)
With her hair so curly, I love you, baby

She said, "What you know 'bout love?" (I'll tell you everything)
I got what you need (Oh)
Walk up in the store and get what you want (Go get it)
You get what you please
We 'bout to get it on, take off them drawers (I said I love you, baby)
It's just you and me
You know what I be on, I'm about to go raw (I love you, baby)
'Cause I like what I see (Oh)

Look, baby, I said I ain't gon' front (Uh)
You got my heart beatin' so fast to words I can't pronounce
And I be gettin' the chills every time I feel your touch
I be lookin' at the top and girl, it's only us
All I need is your trust
And girl I told you once, don't make me tell you twice (Word)
I know you see this print through my pants that I know you like (Like, nah)
And yo' ass be lookin' so fat when it be in them tights (In them tights)
And I'm goin' straight to the top, so hope you ain't afraid of heights
You always keep me right, for a fact, you never left (Left)
Through all the trials and tribulations, always had my best (My best)
So here's fifty-five hunnid, go and get your breasts (Your breasts)
Start rubbin' on your butt, start kissin' on your neck
Hey batter, batter, hey batter, batter (Batter)
Niggas know I had to swing, I had to make a play (Make a play)
I had to apply the pressure, 'cause you my hidden treasure
I think I'm fallin' in love
