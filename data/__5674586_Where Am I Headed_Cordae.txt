3 ContributorsWhere Am I Headed Lyrics
I sip away the pain
Drinking all of my stress
Woke up so I'm blessed
Oh, got me thinking what's next
I been up and down this rollercoaster
Where am I headed?
Straight drop then pour the four up
Nigga, I'm ready

Ever been so close to your goals
Did it all crash in front of your eyes?
Damn near have you wondering why
 than thundering skies, oh man
Life is but a dream, nothing's ever what it seems
Keep that Glock tucked in your jeans
Just to protect these things, oh man
That ain't the way to go but nigga I live
Don't play me on the radio but who are we kidding
But I never had any self-doubt
We was sparking J's back at  house
My niggas gotta get bailed out
And my life turnin' into hell nah
Oh man, shit gettin' way hectic
Nothing ever go my way
Off life I'm stressing, burnt out off five J's
My music gotta be great
I do this shit for pride's sake
I'm so high on the highway
But through the storm we ride waves, oh man
We gon' make it, yeah, I got no other choice
When I get lazy I hear my mother's voice
Saying "Go son, gotta go dumb
'Cause more songs equal more funds
And all them niggas gotta show them
Got a couple hits and you wrote some," like...
You might also like
Sip away the pain
Drinking all of my stress
Woke up so I'm blessed
Oh, got me thinking what's next
I been up and down this rollercoaster
Where am I headed?
Straight drop then pour the four up
Nigga, I'm ready

I see crabs all in a bucket
Nobody gonna make it, they like "Fuck it"
Why do we hate to see each other make it?
Why I don't fuck with niggas? Uncle Ruckus
Louis Vutton, that be the luggage
Outfit custom from my nigga 
I got the activist, it do me justice
I put it overtime, boy I'm clutchest, ayy
I got them big dreams, I never lip sing
I seen a Crip swing til he bleed
It's time to shift things
'Cause no music is uplifting
If you the shit then I'm shitting
Getting locked up off of quick schemes
Was it worth it 
That's the last or the game winner
I'm plotting on to get my fame bigger
But how the fuck I'm gon' get paid quicker
Everybody I know is a grave digger
I see crabs all in a bucket
Nobody gonna make it, they like "Fuck it"
Why do we hate to see each other make it?
Why I don't fuck with niggas? Uncle Ruckus
Sip away the pain
Drinking all of my stress
Woke up so I'm blessed
Oh, got me thinking what's next
I been up and down this rollercoaster
Where am I headed?
Straight drop then pour the four up
Nigga, I'm ready1Embed
