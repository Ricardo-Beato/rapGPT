5 ContributorsWhatcha Gonâ€™ Do Lyrics
Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun-dun
Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun-dun
Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun-dun
Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun-dun

I be dippin' in clubs, girls screamin', "Do you want it Timb'?"
Niggas, playa hatin' sayin', "Who the hell is him?"
I'm in the back, gleamin' from all that virgin gem
Keep a bunch of pretty models surroundin' Timb'
I'm over capac'y when it come to makin' them beats
Me and Missy makin' y'all, move y'all feets
Makin' y'all dance and tango, make y'all legs get weak
That's only 'cause we drop a bunch of heat
That's whatcha gonna expect, comin' from my crew
Bunch of dope beats, and a bunch of dope lyrics too
I know that's too much for you to handle dude
Now ask yourself what

Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?

When me come in the spot, dem wan' jock
Dem nasty boy lookin' around with big cocks
Them girls be plottin' on how to get the rocks
So I beat that ass to the ground like I'm the cops
Ah, what they gon' say? Ah, don't wan' play
Get 'em in the club, ah, smokin' on hay, hey
Ah, when I'm in my ride, oh-ah, people walkin' by
Ah-ah, pistol by my side, in case dem wan' try

Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?

I be gettin' in girls' clothes, make 'em buy my whole wardrobe
Better get all my dough, pluckin' the hair in my nose
It's official, I'm a pimp, 'cause my name glows
Ev'dence I'm back to the Yugo's

Talkin' that junk, you get buried
You don't wanna end up in the cemetery
Me and Timbaland got tracks that will kill you
In the other hand I got gat's that will peel you
Whatcha gon' say? Whatcha gon' do?
When I'm in the club, comin' for you
I'm just a smooth motherfucker (Ah, yeah, baby)
(Y'all heard me) Ah
Whatcha gon' say? Whatcha gon' do?
When I'm in the club and comin' for you
I'm just a smooth motherfucker
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?Embed
