79 Contributors8 Mile: Lyckety-Splyt vs B-Rabbit Lyrics
Tell you something
Check this out, check this out
Yo

This guy's a choke artist, you'll catch a bad one
You're better off shootin' yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
Climbin' up this mountain, you're weak
I'll leave you lost without a paddle, floatin' shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, you the new kid on the block
'Bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
Fuckin' Nazi, your squad ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailer trash, I'll choke you to your last breath
And have you lookin' foolish like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that, 'cause
You follow Future like he got carrots up his ass crack
And when you actin' up, that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid, like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
I'll crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turnin' in his grave
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile to the trailer park

Alright, look
Ayo

This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Erick Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So I'm a German, eh?
That's okay, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can six dicks be pussies?
Talkin' 'bout shit's creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek with paddles this deep
You're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit, this is a turtle race
He can't get with me, spittin' this shit wickedly
Lickety shot suspicious spickety split lickety
So I'ma turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile29Embed
