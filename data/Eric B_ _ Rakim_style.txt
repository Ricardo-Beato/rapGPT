Here I go again, ready to flow again
Better hope my mic don't blow again
Warned by alarms when the mic gets warm
Crowd'll get critical, can't keep calm
Jet for the exit, why hang around?
Words that I found make the mic melt down
If you stay, better cooperate, cuz I  amputate
And whoever don't break, I'mma suffocate
Leave em with asthma, you better pass the
Mic to the massacre master that has the
Power to build and destroy at the same time
So track the wack and the right and exact will shine
Make the beat overheat, but I won't stop
So evacuate the spot when the mic's hot
Switch it from one hand to another
And that's a hint, my brother, run for cover
Because I'm armed, my brain contains a bomb
As if I escaped from Vietnam
Some people label me lethal
Lyrics I made then put beats to
Format, collapse your lungs, twist your tongues
You can't bump your gums off of none of the drums
Words that I made'll create an iller scene
Eric B-eing the fly human being on the guillotine
Hook 'em up to a respirator, cause it's the mister suffocator
What I write its like shoving a mic down your windpipe
Don't let him bite rhymes Rakim write
No mic-to-mouth resuscitation is necessary
No obituary, and nothing left to bury
As he strikes on the same mic twice and then
Cut it on, and I'mma strike again
I meditate off the break, till the place shakes
Then I make rain, hail, snow and earthquakes
Speak the truth, tear the roof off the mother
The stage is stomping grounds -- run for cover
You might also like
Evacuate the building, danger, cause I came to explain a
Strategy that'll be tragic automatically
Havin' me to cause another catastrophe
All you gotta do is give Rakim the
Microphone and the crowd'll yell timber
Buildings collapsin', rappers getting trapped in
Areas closed off, no one gets back in
So set up roadblocks, barricade the cross-fade
Put a detour sign on the stage
Hold my microphone as evidence, the weapon I use
And been using ever since
The days in the park when, rap was an art then
Plus I was dominant, determined and dark-skinned
Making it hard to walk the streets at night
For those who talk the weak beats on the mic
Whoever's living large better wear camouflage
Prepare to be bumrushed when I yell charge
Surround by the sound of the beat-down another brother
This is stomping grounds, run for cover
Wheels or foot better not stay put
Whole place shook till the mic's unhooked
Then you got seven minutes to vacate the premises
Lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes
Don't act wild, single file to the door
No need for an encore, just clear the floor
Cause my mic's about to self destruct
The stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt
So make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned
Cause minutes from now it won't be standin'
Then send out an A.P.B.: All Poets Beware of a brother like me
Now how many rhymes could your man manufacture?
How many biting MCs can I capture?
Trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth
Take over they route, play 'em out like a cub scout
So leave trooping for MCs at war
And if it's a battle let the crowd keep score
Cause me and the drummer make drama, and that's word to mother
Run for coverEmbed

And you can picture like a photo
Music mix, mellow maintains to make
Melodies for emcees, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it, now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, I kill and bomb
But no alarm, Rakim'll remain calm
Self-esteem makes me super, superb and supreme
But for a microphone, still I fiend
This was a tape, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I wanna see you keep following and swallowing
Taking and making, biting and borrowing
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'ma let you sweat, you still ain't warm, you a
Step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posing
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe
What could you say as the Earth gets further and further away?
Planets as small as balls of clay
Astray into the Milky Way, world's out of sight
Far as the eye can see, not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare in the darkness, your knowledge is took
So keep staring, soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the R
This is a lesson if you're guessing and if you're borrowing

Am I eternal or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep you moving 'cause the crowd said so
Dance, cuts rip your pants
Eric B. on the blades bleeding to death, call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murdering emcees
Let's quote, a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah, dope
'Cause every time I stop, it seems you're stuck
Soon as you try to step off, you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showing and proving and letting knowledge be born
Then after that, I'll live forever, you disagree?
You say never? Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory (Rakim)
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember, you're not a slave
'Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name (Rakim)

A furified freestyle, lyrics of fury
My third eye make me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-made
I'll be here when it fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake, so stay awake
And follow and follow because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to daddy, indeed
The R's a rolling stone, so I'm rolling
Directions is told, then the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin', a brother said dig him, I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough, so I drug him
Into danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase it, change your tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B. be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep coming, but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant, clap your hands, you won a trip
The price is right, don't make a deal too soon
How many notes can you name this tune?
Follow the leader is a title, theme, task
Now you know, you don't have to ask
Rap is rhythm and poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records E wrecks
Until then, keep eating and swallowing
You better take a deep breath and keep following the leader

No competition
No competition

Competition is none
I remain at the top like the sun
And I burn whoever come
In the chambers of torture, I caught you
You should have brought your neighborhood to support you
No one in my path can withstand
Under pressure, the wrath of a swift man
You name the day, the grounds could be neutral
Speak your piece, the feeling's mutual
We can go topic from topic, whenever I drop it
Try to stop it
In other words, what the brother heard
He tried to catch it, but what occurred
Was too much weight for one brain to take
Try to concentrate maintain then elevate
From gram to ounce to pound to pound
The matter of weight can't hold my mind down
Permanent damage, I do away with
No time for fun 'cause I don't play with
Competitors, it's only one when I'm done

Introduction, music, where's the mixing
Ra will never die, soon they'll never try
To beat or defeat me because whenever I
Put poetry in motion
From the Nile, then out to the ocean
Three-fourths of water makes seven seas
A third of land, 360 degrees
I circulate and remain to rotate
Seven days a week at a quick or a slow rate
Be prepared whenever I come

Competition is none
It's no competition

Creator, the alphabets, let's communicate
When I translate, the situation's straight
No dictionary's necessary to use
Big words do nothing but confuse and illuse
From the first step, my concept is kept
To the end of the rhyme, it get more in-depth
All thoughts I come across, my mind's the source
Made by the R, of course
Seven holes in my face as I'm looking out my window
Speak with the beat and it seems like the wind blows
Through the speakers, I hear it, so pump this
And we can fill up the whole circumference
With competition, on an impossible mission
Coming up with nothing, keep fishing
No runner up, just lost or forfeits
They all get butterflies soon as the door gets
Unlocked, line for blocks and blocks
Might be trifling to call the cops
Bring along paramedics
But that won't help you, not even calisthenics
I'm God, G is the seventh letter made
Reining on rappers, it's no parade
So if you ain't wise, then don't even come
Competition for this and the mixin' is none

Yo, Rakim, what's up?
Yo, I'm doing the knowledge, E, man, I'm trying to get paid in full
Well, check this out, since Norby Walters is our agency, right?
True
Cara Lewis is our agent
Word up
Zakia and 4th and Broadway is our record company
Indeed
Okay, so, who we rollin' with, then?
We rollin' with Rush, of Rushtown Management
Check this out, since we talkin' over this def beat right here that I put together
I wanna hear some of them def rhymes, you know what I'm sayin'?
And together we can get paid in full

Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain't nothin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking, "How could I get some dead presidents?"
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, "This is a hold-up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nothing move but the money"
But now, I've learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe, I might just
Search for a nine to five, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place 'cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B. and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money, it's still a wish
'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now's a test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full

I'm rated R, this is a warnin', you better void
Poets are paranoid, DJs destroyed
'Cause I came back to attack brothers in spite
Strike like lightnin', it's quite frightenin'
But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park
Not a scream or a cry or a bark, more like a spark
You tremble like an alcoholic, muscles tighten up
What's that? Lighten up, you see a sight, but
Suddenly you feel like you're in a horror flick
You grab your heart, then wish for tomorrow quick
Music's the clue, when I come, you're warned
Apocalypse Now, when I'm done, you're gone
Haven't you ever heard of a MC murderer?
This is the death penalty and I'm servin' a
Death wish, so come on, step to this
Hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist
Friday the 13th, walkin' down Elm Street
You come in my realm, you get beat
This is off limits, so your visions are blurry
All you see is the meters of the volume pumpin' lyrics of fury
It's a—
A furified freestyle

Terror in the styles, never error-files
Indeed, I'm known to exile
For those that oppose to be level or next to this
I ain't a devil and this ain't The Exorcist
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep or wink
The pain's a migraine every time you think
Flashbacks interfere, you start to hear
The R-A-K-I-M in your ear
Then the beat's hysterical
That makes Eric go get an axe and chops the wack
Soon the lyrical format is furier, faces of death remain
MCs decaying 'cause they never stayed
The scene of a crime every night at the show
The fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
It's only one capable, breaks the unbreakable
Melodies unmakeable, pattern unescapable
I haunt if you want, the style, I possess
I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest
For those that envy an MC, it can be
Hazardous to your health, so be friendly
A matter of life and death, just like an Etch A Sketch
Shake 'til you're clear, make you disappear, make the next
After the ceremony, let a rhyme rest in peace
If not, my soul'll release
The scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated
I'm glad you made it
'Cause you're about to see a disastrous sight
A performance never again performed on a mic
Lyrics of fury
A furified freestyle

The R is in the house, too much tension
Make sure the system's loud when I mention
Phrases that's fearsome, you wanna hear some
Sounds that not only pounds, but please your eardrum
I sit back and observe the whole scenery
Then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me
Strictly business, I'm quickly in this
Mood and I don't care if the whole crowd's a witness
I'ma tear you apart, but I'ma spare you a heart
Program into the speed of the rhyme, prepare to start
Rhythm's out of the radius, insane as the craziest
Musical madness MC ever made, see it's
Now an emergency, open-heart surgery
Open your mind, you will find every word'll be
Furier than ever, I remain the future
Battle's temptin', whatever suits you
From words to sentence, there's no resemblance
You think you're rougher? Then suffer the consequences
I'm never dyin', terrifyin' results
I wake you with hundreds of thousands of volts
Mic-to-mouth resuscitation, rhythm with radiation
Novocain ease the pain, it might save him
If not, Eric B.'s the judge, the crowd's the jury
How do I plead to homicide? Lyrics of fury
They're gettin' furier

I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder, damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffiti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration 'cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
Competing 'cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours
I wake you up, and as I stare in your face, you seem stunned
Remember me? The one you got your idea from?
But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher
When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of
Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke
You might also like
I got a question as serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack? Nobody smiling
'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it, so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits
Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours
The E-M-C-E-E, don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those seven emcees
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar
I'll wait 'til E say, "Play 'em"
So I'ma have to diss and broke
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke
I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation 'cause what I invent
I nominated my DJ for president
When I emcee, I'll keep a freestyle going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
There'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiending
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the moral of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
'Cause I'm moving the crowd, and B'll wreck the fader
No interruptions, and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
'Cause everything is real, on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And I'll take you for a walk through hell
Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple-stage darkness
When it get dark again, then I'ma spark this microphone
'Cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finished when the beat is gone, I'm no joke34Embed

Kick along

If you like it a capella, a soul clap will be sweet
Almost complete
Feel the impact when it hit the street
But uh, it sound thicker when I kick it with a beat
See, I can let it speak for itself
But every now and then, it need a little help
Guess who? To the rescue, pump
Ripping up comp, I step and then stomp
A small scam it's in the land like Mr. Timberland
Prepare the stage for Rakim to stand
Then I pick a song, grab the mic, click it on
Time to get it on, kick along
See if you can move to the words I speak
Pick up on a rhythm (hit 'em with the beat)
My mental-ect gets warm, feed into your physical form
You can't keep calm
Get fit to the skit, try to hop on
Get hip to the trick as I flip the script
You're feelin' rust like a thrust of an arrow, plus
You're lookin' through the eye of a barrel, bust
Emergency, take him to the operatin' room
Put him on the floor, let his heart feel the boom
React to the wrath of a brand new song
Then kick along

Break straight to the floor
'Cause I'ma make more
Each one's composed in the shows and each one flows
How long? Nobody knows
And whoever try to take 'em, I'ma break 'em
Drag it out of him, dehydrate 'em
The beat makes the beat in your heart accelerate
Your pulse is a drumroll, too late to wait
A pen'll send adrenaline to ten
If then begin to blend the smooth that's sent
That's to prevent you from gettin' asthma
You try to keep up, because, the cut has ya
Blood pressure to the point, never stops a drop
Puttin' stain in the veins in the brain, your blood clots
Too quick to pause it, you almost lost it
So, kick along til you're all exhausted
And look what my data made, my power'll never fade
I keep it energetic, or hype as Gatorade
Now kick it with a beat
C'mon, kick along

They can't wait to kick steps to this
So, I make a skit just for kicks
Syncopated, coursing through
Innovated because the flow
Melodic and melodramatic styles occur
Like a choreographer, my mind's a photographer
Makin' music visible for the individual that gets visual
What I manifest you express on the dance floor
Pants get torn when the jam is on
'Cause I kick rhymes until the rhymes kick back
It's hard to kick that, where did you get that?
Here's the concept, part of your concert
Expect the expert to perfect and do work
Don't stop the song 'til I'm gone
Keep gettin' it on, kick it off with the horns
Kick along

"007 is back"

I don't stress my day 'cause it's best to parlay
I guess you could say I've been away
I wake up slow when I'm hot but I destruct the plant
And fourteen hands comb New York for fans
They make waves as they wiggle in my waterbed
Pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread
A mornin' massage turnin into a real rough rubdown
So I figured I'll lay around
They keep me wet with a juice called Tahiti
It make the room steamy, so soon they couldn't see me
They know more than calisthenics as they worked up a sweat
It wasn't even ten o'clock yet
Scrub down, then I get moist, they never treat me mean
They sweetly keep me squeaky clean
I chill as they filled the jacuzzi
I said, "I'm tight from a real long flight, could you soothe me
Support my thoughts, 'cause I got a lot of writing to do"
They said, "Cool" and just enjoyed the view
It ain't hard 'cause it's miles from the sidewalk
I'm overlookin' every borough in New York
The entire Empire State to concentrate
For every rhyme I make
So at exactly noon they played my favorite tune
And just before they all cleared the room
They said, "We're glad you're home from tour, now we feel secure
We wish you didn't have to leave no more"
But they wanna go to war, they even tried to shoot up the door
"007 is back"
Rest assured

That's how they react when I attack the mic
In fact it's like a stack of dynamite, powerful and bright
Girls love to squeeze me real tight
007 is back
Ra has returned to romance 'em, better than Johnny Handsome
When I was young women said, "Damn son"
Ain't nothin' changed but the year and I'm still here
C'mere dear, let me whisper in your ear
Hug my words so I can taste your lips
I set up hips like domino chips
But I don't let 'em hit the floor
And if you got sore, then feel secure
Where's the pain? Is it the spot you set us in?
Almost magic, better than medicine
Take one of these and put your mind at ease
I get more work than a lot of M.D.'s

But don't get fooled by metaphor

Causalities Of War; as I approach the barricade
Where's the enemy? Who do I invade?
Bullets of Teflon, bulletproof vest rip
Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips
'Cause I got a family that waits for my return
To get back home is my main concern
I'mma get back to New York in one piece
But I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
Skylights up like fireworks blind me
Bullets, whistlin' over my head remind me
President Bush said "Attack"
Flashback to 'Nam, I might not make it back
Missile hits the area, screams wake me up from a war of dreams
Heat up the M-16
Basic training, trained for torture
Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya
Addicted to murder, send more body bags
They can't identify 'em, leave the name tags
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor

Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall?
Somebody give the President a call
But I hear warfare scream through the air
Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare
A Desert Storm, let's see who reigns supreme
Something like Monopoly - a government scheme
Go to the Army, be all you can be
Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me
So I start lettin' off ammunition in every direction
Allah is my only protection
But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same
And this is Asia, from where I came
I'm on the wrong side, so change the target
Shootin' at the general, and where's the sergeant?

It'll be more dead people after this
So I'm glad to be alive and walkin'
Half of my platoon came home in coffin
Except the general, buried in the Storm
In bits and pieces, no need to look for him
I played it slick and got away with it
Rigged it up so they would think they did it
Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet
When THEY call, I'm going AWOL
'Cause it ain't no way I'm goin' back to war
When I don't know who or what I'm fightin' for
So I wait for terrorists to attack
Every time a truck backfires, I fire back
I look for shelter when a plane is over me
Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G
Kamikaze, strapped with bombs
No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam
Did I hear gunshots, or thunder?
No time to wonder, somebody's goin' under
Put on my fatigues and my camouflage
Take control, 'cause I'm in charge
When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor

What's going on?

What's happening, it's been so long, what's going on
And what's going wrong? The good old days are gone
You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man
You invented a scam even you don't understand
You rig the enigma, can't figure it out
You change the route, now you're in doubt
You use to cut class, smoked grass, still passed
Figured you was all that but that ain't last
The times is harder, the drugs is heavier
You say whatever, the more, the merrier
Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes
Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes
No more good times, no more time
Too far to find, you're almost blind
You can't see what spot that the trap is in
(Hey bruh!) What's happening!
You had it mapped out, your plans get torn
You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone
You said you quit, stated your word is bond
(Hey bro) what's going on?

My neighborhood don't look so good
I'll find a way out, yeah, I would if I could
But the government is doing a project
So I live in the projects
Where we fight for elbow room to the doom
Try to live long but you die too soon
I might not be alive to see 25
Taught at ten to make money and strive
I sold tapes at school and made some ends
Met alot of skins and even made some friends
Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run with
Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun with
But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test
But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress
And then shake hands like a man
'Cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand
But you had a one on one fight with drugs
When we ain't cool no more, we bust slugs
Clip after clip, until one of us is gone
(Hey bruh) what's going on?


The crime rate in New York State elevate
A city filled with hate, more deaths accumulate
Drug wars daily, a lot of blood spilled
Kids on the playground shot down and killed
Nobody wants to live on the first floor no more
'Cause stray bullets explore
We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely
And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be
Rubbed out in a quest for clout
The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out
Half of the projects is dead or locked up
Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up
Human abortion create distortions
And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when
Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born
(Hey bruh) What's going on?

Try to identify the man in front of ya
But it ain't the role, the gear, or the money, the
Swift intellectionist with plenty of
Bite, if it's dark, I'll spark every one of ya
I throw a mic in the crowd, if it's questioned
I got the answer, it includes directions
Go manufacture a match, show me after
A blast of a master that has to make musical massacre
Attack your rap 'till it's handicapped
You'll never hold the mic again, try to hand it back
For every rapper that comes, I cut off his thumbs
Put a record to his neck, if he swallows, it hums
Slice from ear-to-ear, so he can hear better
Before he bleed to death, hear, hear every letter
And you can see how quick and thick the blood can get
If you try to change the style or the subject
As I get deep in the rhyme, I'm becomin' a
MC murderer, before I'm done, I'mma
Prepare the chamber, the torture's comin' up
Trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's The Punisher!
Kill 'em again!
You might also like
I hold the mic as hostage, MC's as ransom
Rhymes'll punish 'em 'cause they don't understand 'em
I heat up his brain, then explain that I hand him
A red-hot microphone... that's how I brand 'em
Rhymes fall in formation, unite and ignite
Like a platoon puttin' bullet wounds in the mic
If ya curse me, it ain't no mercy
Give 'em an autopsy, killed by versin' me
I took a kid and cut off his eyelids
Killin' him slow so he could see what I did
And if he don't understand what I said
I'm pushin' his eyeballs wayyyy to the back of his head
So he can see what he's gettin' into
A part of the mind that he never been through
A journey is comin' 'cause ya gettin' sent to
A place harder to find, but it's all in the mental
I run a brain scan to locate his game plan
When I'm through with his brain, he ain't the same man
Did he lose his mind or lost in his mind?
But this ain't the lost and found because ya can't find
Your foundation, coastin'
Your mind is driftin' in slow motion... frozen
Looks like another murder at the Mardi Gras, B
Too late to send out a search party
Once ya out of ya head, then ya can't get back
I give him a map, but he still get trapped
So prepare the chamber, the torture's comin' up
Trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's The Punisher!
Kill 'em again!

Dangerous rhymes performed like surgery
Cuts so deep, you'll be bleedin' burgundy
My intellect wrecks and disconnects your cerebral cortex
Your cerebellum is next!
Your conscience becomes sub-conscious
Soon, your response is nonsense
The last words are blurred, mumbled then slurred
Then your verbs are no longer heard
You get your lung fried so good you're tongue-tied
He couldn't swing or hang, so he hung 'till he died
Reincarnate him and kill him again
Again and again, again and again
I leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him
I got a dead-emceein' museum
When I create 'em, I cremate 'em and complicate 'em
You can't save 'em, there's no ultimatum
Mics lay around full of ashes, with the victim's name in slashes
Got a long list and I'mma get every one of ya
Beware of The Punisher!
Then I'ma kill 'em again!
Wake 'em up... kill 'em again!3Embed
Pass the hand grenade, it's gonna blow 'cause I took out the pin
Detached the detonator, data sent
Programmed with protons, equipped with predicates
Electrons and elements just fit
Your pronoun hits the ground and that's that
Hit the floor like a meteor so get back
Commas and quotation marks separate the sparks
Followed the course in to avoid getting sharked
More volts than a lightning bolt, handle with care
I'm far from fragile, warfare won't tear
Armed and dangerous, trained for combat
Let off rounds and they won't respond back
Explosions I made to invade your parade
Your weak beats decay til they can't get played
Wrong elements in the mic, they get sprayed
Pass the hand grenade

After the stage gets warm, I heat it up
The crowd gets charged, I speed it up
They couldn't get warm, gimme a cut
The rhyme gets good, so eat it up
Food for thought until your thoughts is sore
Fill up a coliseum, I can serve them all
Bake another plate, and cook it far from raw
And if you're overweight, then here's some more
'Cause every dish I make tastes great and plus filling
If I sold a third of my rhymes, I make a killing
Get the salt and pepper from the maid
Get the blood off the blade, pass the hand grenade

If you try this, your response is tonsillitis
I'm leaving authors and writers with arthritis
You got the slightest ideas, I got the brightest
Here's the lightest, so clear, it's out of sight, it's
Dark, but from the darkness, came the light
The night is the time for Ra to recite it
Educated, but complicated style
For all the biters, I'm shutting rappers up like Midas
I got the force of a Turbo Porsche
You get lost in the source and then thrown off course
You can't destroy the decoy's to detour
No sense of direction so what's your speed for
You wouldn't have never made it, how many styles have I created
So many rhymes I bust, you're frustrated
Then the mic will self-destruct, you'll get sprayed
Pass the hand grenade1Embed
She asked could I keep the beat?
So, here's the beat, every time it pounds, you get weak
Comfy, embedded like a pillow, bouncin' with an echo
My voice is moist, and plus mellow
I got it goin' on, you're gonna wanna come
Skins is the drum, I said I'm the drummer, give the drummer some
And we'll see if you can hang wit Ra
Hmm, let's see if you can Shangri-La
Easy like Teena Marie, I play it slick like Rick James
I'm the Fire and your Desire's flames
I heat up your temperature, keep the tempo raw
When you start to smoke, rest assured
I start to think 'cause you're a singer like Anita
High pitched like a tweeter, deep beats start to beat her
Much harder than love taps, my rap's above that
I get girls where I want with a maze full of love traps
But I don't want to fall in love
I stand in love, good balanced with a plan to shove
A capella as we start to speak
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek
Then I complete the beat

Tempo's movin' and I'm hopin' it'll never fade away
The beat is groovin', words are soothin'
And please tell me that you're here to stay
In the mornin' and I'm hopin' the mornin' come again
Hold me close and give me another dose and
Keep the beat, don't ever let it end

She said, "R, so far, you didn't miss a beat yet"
Pop in another cassette, then I'm in to wreck
I'll give you a beat you never had before
I had to explore and came up with more
Deep trunk kicks with a brick for a drum stick
You know the song, don't hum along, come quick
You lay like Sade, it feels like paradise
At the top of the pyramid, we review new heights
The scenery of Egypt, you and me as we get
So deep in the groove, when you move, you get seasick
You seen enough, close your eyes and relax
Move wit the tracks and stay tuned for the sax
The instrumental enters your mental
Tense but gentle and sentimental
A capella as we start to speak
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek
Then I complete the beat

Tempo's movin' and I'm hopin' it'll never fade away
The beat is groovin', words are soothin'
And please tell me that you're here to stay
In the mornin' and I'm hopin' the mornin' come again
Hold me close and give me another dose and
Keep the beat, don't ever let it end
She wanted the extended version
So, I kept splurgin' and add more words in
Strong: the emotion, notions move and
The poetry's smokin', potions soothin'
There goes the moon, I'm far from done
Rise like the sun, here comes the sun
And I won't stop 'til it sets and then
Rewind the cassettes and I'ma play it again
But this time, it's instrumental at a faster tempo
All I wanna hear is "Yeah, Rakim, go!"
I work overtime on your body and mind
'Cause I'm inclined to do both combined
My job is never done but done well
Horizontal or parallel
A capella as we start to speak
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek
Then I complete the beat

Tempo's movin' and I'm hopin' it'll never fade away
The beat is groovin', words are soothin'
And please tell me that you're here to stay
In the mornin' and I'm hopin' the mornin' come again
Hold me close and give me another dose and
Keep the beat, don't ever let it end3Embed
Relaxed with pep

My styles will move, I'm calm but deadly, heat up but cool
I'm rough as a right hook but still look smooth, even when I'm unseen
I show and prove - women, I give 'em pain and still soothe
As I'll put you down but I'm hard to put up with
Swell up like helium but I can make it fit
I'm taking what I want and make you wanna give it here
Provoking you to flaunt, you get the idea
Got it, gone, my schedule is packed
My day is laidback 'cause I'm ahead of all that
Then I can relax 'cause I'm before my time
I hand you a manual before the rhymes
So you can catch up and keep up and move right along
The day is kind of off but I can get it on
I'm taking it step by step and when the night is in depth
It's cool cause I'm relaxed with pep

Relaxed with pep
Relaxed with pep

I enchant a riot with a quiet storm
Is it the way I parlay or the knowledge being born?
All praises due to the magnificent, most high and magnificent
From him, I was sent with intent
To invent new ways for better displays for better days
No more crimes, I got rhymes and it pays
I'm prepared to take mine and get mine
And I can protect mine either with a rhyme or a nine
A silent rage but if amplified
Rhymes multiply, it's hard to provoke when I
Put a mode in effect, the episode's correct
Reload and you don't know what code to respect
I get swift and changeable, adapt and master
But still remaindable, rap gets faster
Reacts and projects, attracts and it get
To the max, it's in depth, it attacks but it's relaxed with pep

Relax, I'll track, out lap the half stepper
Here come the right one baby, I'm Dr. Pepper
So check the Richter scale,  rhymes overload
Blow up and explode abrupt and reload the code
You can't pinpoint or locate the rate
Or evaluate the up-to-date
Stayed upfront, laid back, coming off on track
Girls want some of this because I'm all that
Sweat the concept as the ep's in depth
As the track is kept, you can't intercept the step
Reacts and projects and attracts and it gets
To the max and in-depth, it attacks but it's relaxed with pep

I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn
"Hello, good lookin', is this seat tooken?"
On the A-train, pickin' at her brain
I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name (I'm curious!)
I said I still like your style of fashion
But I hate your high saddity attitude with a passion
Is it because brothers like to hawk a lot?
Is it because you're shy and don't talk a lot?
She turned away, no play, I said okay
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight
I was thinkin' of the rhymes I wrote last night
Next stop was mine, a familiar scene
I was meetin' my friend Killer Ben in Fort Greene
Where the girls are real, and tell ya how they feel
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel
See, I don't bend, and I won't rust
And I don't break, and I won't bust
Stomped up the street, and did I hear a treat?
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me
Did she live in the area? Was she tryin' to find me?
Hmm.. I didn't wanna play myself out
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout
Now, was she shy? She didn't walk by
She came in the store, and she even said "Hi"
Curiosity, at a high velocity
Maybe possibly, she had the hots for me
I said if we're playin' games, then we're gonna play mine
I'mma lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find
I wanna know what's on your mind

About a week went by and I called her — "Hello"
I said "Yo, can I speak to, um..",  she said "No"
"Hey, yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't wanna stress you
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you"
See, I wanna get to know you
So I can show you what a strong relationship can grow to
But you gotta trust me, and you're gonna love me
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me
Now, how does it feel when my mental massage ya temple
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
Next you see ecstasy's explosions
Now I'm comin' to see you to spend some time
I'm a romantic warrior, but is it a crime?
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find
I wanna know what's on your mind

I wanna know what's on your mind

Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
I'm in your head so you'll be thinkin' of me
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown
How do 125th street sound?
Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo
Probably be watchin' Bill Cosby tomorrow
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate
Every word is an instrument
Makin' sounds and tones and songs and moans
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones
She smiled and said "You never know what the day will bring
It's always a new song to sing"
The next day, I went back to her rest
Knocked on the door, intentions — finesse
She let me in and had nothin' but a negligee on
Smellin' like Liz Claiborne
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables
She sat next to me and said "What's up wit' you?"
I got the feelin' for sexual healin'
A mental healin', how you feelin'?
She caught the effect and said she feel the same
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain?
Desire's yearnin', the fire's burnin'
You hot 'cause it's a lot you're learnin'
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world
It's take a long time 'cause I'm just beginnin', girl
Take it easy, cut off the TV
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find
'Cause now I know what's on your mind9Embed
No more time to pass time 'cause these are the last rhymes
'Cause we're living in the last times
They wanna go to war, more wars to come
But most of us fight more wars than one
Discrimination in the racial nation
While they destroy our strong foundation
Nature's balance is way off balance
They tip the scale, now it's no more silence
The hole in the ozone layer's outta control
But they wanna fight for more oil and gold
Unemployment, I got laid off
The streets is the last resorts to get paid off
For more, more mint, no dough for rent
I gotta shed blood to make a red cent
Maybe I should ask the president
Somebody get me the president
But he don't want to hear it, it's out of the question
'Cause in my section it's worse than recession
So I go to a rich neighborhood and play Robin Hood
Take from the bad and give to the good
First I go to Bensonhurst, steal a Benz, snatch a purse
Pick up my friends, that's when it gets worse
'Cause I need government and they need government
A lot of mint spent, now I gotta pay rent
Who makes the most dead presidents in the projects
You're gonna get robbed and wrecked
I parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot
Let's get him for all he got
I approached him slow like I was a basehead
Put the four-fifth to his face and said
You see those kids over there with the hoods
Walk to 'em real slow and give them the goods
First the gun and the dough and crush the jumbos
One false move and no one knows
'Cause I got a silencer to hush the bust
And I'm in a rush, so hush the fuss
Plus the poison you fed will no longer spread
You're good as dead, I'm a fill your head with lead
That's when I pushed him into his building
To murder him, but I remembered his children

We gotta teach the children everyday, keep a song
Show them the light, teach them right from wrong
Make some sense so they can carry on

We gotta teach the children so that they can sing along
Understand the words in this song
Can't be done when we're gone, so

Teach the children, save the nation
I see the destruction, the situation
They're corrupt, and their time's up soon
But they'll blow it up and prepare life on the moon
Sounds like Total Recall
But who got a spaceship, you get it, we fall
So hope for the best and expect the worst
The end is near and it's U-N-I verse
The one's that interfere with nature
Labeled you limited and underrate ya
His plans over rule when he separates ya
Now it's U-N-I verse, the one that hates ya
So we gotta let them know we're hip to the script
Change the skit, or we're about to flip
'Cause we want access to happiness
Living the good life and much success
Equal opportunity
Self awareness and unity
Education, the kids need a sculpture
Teach them the abacus and their culture
And that'll help stop the robbing, raping and killing
Poison neighborhoods are illing
But they import more keys from across seas
A drug disease hits the streets with ease
So keep on building, 'cause we gotta keep building
Til the answers are filled in
And make sure you don't stop till then
And if you do, remember the children3Embed

State of the art, engineered for the mix
Eardrums are playin' along to what I'm sayin', you're singin' a song
Stevie Blass on the keyboard, swingin' along
But you don't have to dance, play it cool and listen
My DJ's mixin' and I'll do the quizzin'
'Cause who is number one? If not best, then better
Here's a hint, the eighteenth letter
The rhymes is sportable, microphone is portable
For any immortal man, swords is not affordable
Never take a loss 'cause I'm hard to beat
I ain't cheap, but don't sell me a dream, I don't sleep
I'm paid in full, so save the bull
This ain't a stick-up, you don't have to wave your tool
You feel sure, and you want more, then wipe your sweat
'Cause I just wanted to see how hype you could get
'Cause when I came in the door
Steppin' hard enough to shake the floor
I just started, but the others can't make no more
Runnin' out of beats, breaks and out of time
If I was gone, you'd be runnin' out of rhymes
I prove records don't have to be long

Phrases, thoughts made by the R of course
One thing I do is keep 'em different and far from yours
You keep talkin', when will all the damage be done?
You say you're rulin', but when I'm in the place, you don't come
Maybe you're waitin' to see what I'm makin'
One more style gets taken, then I'ma be breakin'
Into patterns and pauses, piano is soft
But make it hard for you to start where I left off
You find yourself lost 'til the point is across
You hit reverse to rewind it, that's when you hit the pause
I set the scene, first, you hear mixin'
Then the microphone fiend's in effect, still listenin'?
Pay close attention, never before mentioned
Listen up, I got a brand-new invention
Made from a musician, its notes are played crisp
But listeners listen to what I wrote on a disc
Copywritten but still bitten, it almost sound like
Almost pumpin', but it ain't down like
A record's supposed to sound, watch it, it goes around
Records are broken, smashed into the ground
That ain't my melody, brothers keep runnin' up and tellin' me
Others are tryin' to flow smooth and steadily
Potholes are left in my path, then I crash and bruise
Whoever refuse and cruise right past 'em
'Cause I just left to do it for easy forever, death
'Til I get back, you better stay in step
At the speakers, you'll stare, if I was there, your description is
Letters full of poetical messages, this is for the listeners

How could I keep my composure?
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure?
Release, then veins in the brains increase
When I let off, make a wish and blow the smoke off my piece
Unloadin', unfold and the rhymes are explodin'
And the mic that I'm holding's golden
Cordless 'cause the wire caught fire like a fuse
Gunpowder and the slightest bruise is a friction
The outcome is near, so listen, here's a brief description:
A boom and flame and smoke, ashes are dust to dust
Contact is compact when I bust
MC's are now in a massacre, a disaster, a master at fashion, I
Beat to death, to a pulp 'til it can't pump
Speakers ain't sayin' nothin', now the ball can thump
As I'm lookin', I stand like brick buildings in Brooklyn
Then the stage is took, then
Havoc struck that could product a holocaust
Keep in touch the mic when you're holdin' yours
Huffin' and puffin' and slobbin' and droolin'
Nothing's pumpin', who do you think ya foolin'?
Tommy Tucker? The neighborhood sucker?
What you oughta do, is pick up a tempo
From what I invent, so hard not to bite, but you can't prevent, so
You start to kidnap, I watch a kid rap
When he get off, he know he shouldn't have did that
Minor, old-timer, weak rhymer, stay in liner
You won't be inclined to go so, yo
Maybe later, you're gonna be
But for now, you're almost one of me
Now, the immature imitation's taken from originations
Made by changin' and a little arrangin'
So, perform, if ya still ain't warm, maybe after a roast
By the host with the most, it's a Musical Massacre

Ya out of the flames, pre-heat, the temperature change
Anywhere within the range of Celsius
Fahrenheit on the mic might melt, see it
Burns soon as it's felt, see, it's
Torchin', scorchin', mic's pipin' hot
Steamin', who's schemin'? Nah, ya not
James Brown must've been dusted, disgusted
Now he can't be trusted
Embalmed with fluids, static can cause explosion
In fact, impact's closin' in
Time was up, so I release a time bomb
Beat gives me a heat-stroke, but I rhyme calm
Pull out the tool, sometimes I wanna break fool
But I was cool like one in the chamber
Let's play a game of rhymin' roulette
Then put me up to your brain, then name a rhyme about ya clout
One mistake, ya out
If this is demonstration, it can't be the same show
Maybe you're too fly, somewhere over the rainbow
Courage, heart, and brain, you need rhymes
Turn on your mic, snap your fingers three times, you're gone
Or the story won't end the same, and you'll feel the flame
The potion was weak, make another antidote
What's the science? Why can't ya quote?
Elements for musical intelligence, rhymes are irrelevant
No development, and that settles it
Go manufacture a match, send me after a blast
Of a master that has to make Musical Massacre3Embed

Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands

I create 'em, take 'em, shake 'em, then make 'em clap to this
Most of you rappers can't even rap to this
I made it faster, you tried to master
Syncopated styles, words flowin' after
Measures of metaphor definitions of more than one
Take it both ways, I'll be here when you're done
Remember, as the rhyme goes on, it's rougher
Soon as I stop, you had enough of
Followin' footsteps, you better turn back soon
Sucker MC's suck rhymes like vacuums
The style remains the same, the words is changed
Bitten, rewritten, recited, and rearranged
Sing along if your tongue is strong, it gets sore
Sing when I'm gone and it'll break your jaw
Wisdom flows so swift, I'm Asiatic
Is it a gift or automatic?
Static, I don't cling
I got a tip of my own and I don't sing
Don't understand? Here's an example
On why MCs and DJs sample
'Cause we don't have a band, it's just my voice and his hands
That's what hip-hop was, it still stands
The records we use are from mom and pop's collection
Find a break from a dope selection
And go to the store, then buy one more
So my DJ can mix 'cause that's what his hands are for
Years later, hip-hop got contracts
The chance to put actual facts on wax
My mind's the coach, the physical form's the team
The top's the destination, I'm the cream
And still I rise with somethin' pumpin' and somethin' clever
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your—, clap your—
Clap 'em, clap 'em
Clap your hands

Now, who's the man with the master plan?
With stacks of verbal attacks? So clap your hands
Rhyme written in graffiti, xeroxed on blueprints
Students influenced are now a nuisance
You couldn't fight it, you had to clap to this
You got excited, you almost snapped your wrist
The rhymes was written for the crowd's enjoyment
When I'm with this, you can't toy with
The Def Jam juicer, rough rhyme producer
Loads of lyrics get you loose then looser
The man so smooth and world so rough
Eric is throwin' and sewin', rippin', restitchin' the cuts
Microphone, Your Majesty, no one's bad as me
Seems the tragedy, Rakim had to be
Thinkin' of some def view of a video
Visions are vicious and I'll let the city know
Whoever's frontin', they know, nothin' to say though
So lay low, musical forms are kickin' like Kato
Don't get near it, hard as you ever hear it
I know it's fearified, but don't fear it
And try to predict which rhyme you can kick
You're quick to pick your best 'fore the mic is lit
Instead of goin' with the flow like you're supposed to go
And enjoy the show and, yo, put your hands together
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Put your hands together (Clap your hands)
Clap your hands
Clap your hands (Clap your—)5Embed
Whoever underestimated still waited
Pumpin' the radio, finally, they played it
You wondered how come the album was late?
I was givin' you time to get the last one straight
The show must go on, I got somethin' to dance to
Slow it down and romance to and give me a chance to
Keep you in tune and up to par
Then you're doin' it with The R
Doin' it with The R

Somethin' new and to keep you doin' what you're doin'
This is for you and your crew and for who in
The vicinity, I don't need no identity
I see hands in the air, that means many be
Cooperatin', I can't stop relatin'
Hip-hop is makin' more sense when I'm statin'
Paragraphs of potential to prevent you from usin' my instrumental
Keep in mind, I meant to
Illustrate another iller break immediately
Hurry up and learn the words and repeat it with me
Then soon, you're in tune and up to par
And then you're doin' it with The R
Keep doin' it, you keep doin' it with The R

In the summertime, pockets bulgin'
Something's happenin', then I'm indulgin'
Music is mine, Gucci seats reclined
Gold grill, a paint job will shine
Pull up in the park and then pop the trunk
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
A block party starts to form, people start to swarm
Loud as a ghetto blaster, word is bond
Records remind you of a madness
The moment it's played, you get glad it's
The return of the brother, keepin' you up to par
And you're doing it with The R

You know what I'm sayin'?
The microphone fiend Rakim in full effect
DJ Eric B. need more records to wreck
To the Queens posse, you're doin' it with the R
Brooklyn, you're doin' it with The R
The Bronx is doin' it with The R
Manhattan, keep doin' it with The R
And Strong Island, you're doin it with The R
Wyandanch and the Paid In Full posse doin' it with The R
Peace to the Nation of Islam
And I'm outta here

Pump it up, homeboy
Pump it up, homeboy

Knowledge will begin until I finish this song
'Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on
You sweat as you step, about to get hype
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic
You're physically in this with me, but how could you tell
If it's meant to be hip-hop if you're not mentally as well
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured
Into the mic, so unite and this won't be so bored
If you just keep kickin', listen to the mix
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
Holds and controls you 'til I leave
You fall deeper in the style, it's hard to breathe
The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then
Bring 'em to the front 'cause my rhyme's the oxygen
Then wave your hand, when you're ready I'll send you
Into your favorite dance, but let the rhyme continue
And so on, and I'ma go on simultaneously
And even if I stop, the rhyme remains to be
Rising to the top and I came to drop it
Catch it and quiz it is my topic
Universal 'cause I move everybody to come
By exercising your mind, you'll coincide as one
Then look around and see how packed the party starts to get
I draw a crowd like an architect
The five boroughs react and all the islands attract
And every state can't wait, so they attack
Off a spot on the floor, squeeze in 'cause it's packed
It'll be more room if MCs play the back
I'm the R, the A to the K-I-M
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
The microphone fiend if I was a fake
Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make
I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite
Sung it on stage, some said it don't sound like
The voice on the record, I see what you mean
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream
So just give me a mic, if it's loud, I'll blow it
If not, into the crowd I'll throw it
Pull out my cordless mic then entertain you well
Before I let go, I'ma spark your brain cell
I took time to write, tonight I will recite
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight
Rhymes start flowin', kisses are blowin'
MCs are knowin', that's why they're goin'
Home to tell a friend when the party end
"Yo, man, you know Rakim? That brother struck again"
'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage
Tape by tape and page by page
When the crowd is moving, I compete with the mix
The rougher the cuts, the rougher the rhyme gets
Deeper and deeper, I hope you understand it
I made it up myself and I planned it
For other MCs who waste time (Pump it up, homeboy)
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme
I cross my arms and I was waiting, but I was hating
The rappers on the microphone was fronting, just faking
They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin'
To get up on the microphone and then start takin'
Control of the mic, uptight when I grabbed it
So hug the speaker, your ear's a magnet
Attracted to a freestyle put in effect
You listen to the man while you're sippin' Moet
So Eric, pick up the needle (Yeah) put it in the middle (Alright)
Give me a scratch, turn my mic up a little
I want you to hear this perfectly clear
Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea?
I hope you 'knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished, this song
The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on

Thank you DJs

I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnetize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking until I hit my last note
My mind remains refined, all kind of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B., make 'em clap to this

But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist?
Say indeed and I'll proceed 'cause my man made a mix
If he bleed, he won't need no Band-Aid to fix
His fingertips, so I rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up, because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it 'cause it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side of me, erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
'Cause I'm better than the rest of them
Eric B. is on the cut and my name is Rakim

Make 'em clap to this

Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand 'cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately

Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
Make— Make 'em— Make 'em clap to this
Caught an attitude, you need food to eat up

Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer, and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind start to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause when I heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd?
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It's simple, ain't it? But quite clever
Some of you've been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause, if not, and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long, 'cause I'ma move on
The dance floor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd

Move the crowd

So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving, but eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth is shut
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric B is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent, wise on the mic, I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise is due to Allah and that's a blessing
With knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving

Me and the rap's laid back
Nonchalant and relaxed in the track
Put together well, so it ain't hard to tell
Easy to recognize, so my records are sell
On the microphone, well known with a low tone
Show and prove when the stage show is shown
All you hear is screams when I'm hit by the laser beams
Ladies fiend, rappers are choosin' up teams
To hook the beat up, just before we meet up
Before I kick a rhyme, I kick my feet up
To let you know, everything's under control
Under surveillance, takin' over your soul
So let me handle this, gettin' scandalous
All my jams are hits, never plan to miss
Crowd is captured, released at my permission
Peep 'em, as I, keep 'em eager to listen

Opponents are found paralyzed from the mic down
Left with a little sight, ears still hear the sound
Try to clear your mind, but it's still there
Give him about a year, then give him a wheelchair
I damage and deteriorate, till you're brain dead
No huss cuss what I discuss bust his head
Here's some hearing aids when your eardrums fail
You get scars, so you could read it in braille
Close your third eye, then I do bodywork
And I keep the same procedure till somebody's hurt
My DJ'll sew up cuts like an M.D
And I still move crowds like an M.C
Entertainer-tear you out of your frame
Leave you in a puddle of blood, then let it rain
Then I get deep, so try to withstand
On my level to think, or sink like quicksand
He couldn't hang, so I cut the rope short
Watchin' 'em fall, 'cause they need more support
This is the way that I done, all of my competition
Peep 'em, as I, keep 'em eager to listen
You might also likeKeep 'em eager to listen

The performance I give 'em is, something like a hypnotism
Swinging back and forth, 'till you can keep the rhythm
At the tone of my voice, you will become
Eager to listen, dance in a trance 'till you see the
R on stage, no cheers, all ears
All three of your eyes on me, so it appears
Just like you thought it would be, but even better
Live and direct on stage, instead of the
Radio or video or studio rehearsin'
I'm at my best in flesh in person
The main attraction, center of attention
The crowd will go crazy, soon as I mention
It's time to communicate, so let's conversate
I get my point across when you respond I make sense
So now we could continue the mission
As I, keep 'em eager to listen
As I, keep 'em eager to listen

I used to always say one day
I'll play in the N-B-A, 'cause I'll slay
Opponents well, and also excel
As a black quarterback in the N-F-L
My goal's to score, so I can hear the crowd roar
Keep 'em out of they're seats, and on the floor
And when I win, it'll pump my adrenaline
My record is undefeated, and I'll win again
I'll never lose or hear boos from the audience
'Cause they participate and applaud me, since
I bring 'em what they want to hear
And they'll fill up the atmosphere
With people that came to party, and have a good time
So when I'm gone, I'm sure, you understood the rhyme
Because I promise to accomplish the mission
'Cause I, keep 'em eager to listen3Embed
I came to set 'em straight, and let 'em know
Whoever's holdin' the best, just let him go
'Cause here's the inside scoop on the fiend
They wanna know why I'm seldom seen
'Cause who needs the TV screens and magazines
Or shootin' through the city in fly limousines
There's one thing I don't like, it's the spotlight
'Cause I already got light
They be like, yo, we had a get together last week
And we know everyone was there except the Black Sheep
Because my schedule is tight, I gotta write
I'm deep in the archives, and keeping 'em hyped
It's been a long time, since you heard a strong rhyme
None of these are weak so when you bite on mine
We can trace the hits and then name that style
MCs'll be out of a job for a while
I re-posess your identification
So, hand in your application
Put your mic on strike until you're unemployed
Contract is up and I'm stampin' it void
Your selection ain't this selective
So I'ma put you in your proper perspective
On the dance-floor, and doin' the shake
Ready to let 'em brake, set 'em straight
You might also like
Somebody said I set 'em up and pulled the plug on 'em
But instead, I let 'em go on so I could bug on 'em
Go 'head and flow, 'cause I close the show
Swing a song for the ladies and rhyme real slow
For instance, once I commence
The crowd is convinced
So now you know who to put your money on
Hurry up, before your money's gone
'Cause I'm the most common denominator
Orchestrate a rhyme much greater
I'm like a world almanac, so tell the media
Givin' 'em information like encyclopedia
So bring a dictionary so you can look it up
So you know what I mean, when I hook it up
No misconceptions although I complicate
But this concept'll set em straight
They even said that I was locked in jail
So now I guess I'm out on bail?
The only island I was on was the Strong one
And if I did my bid, it'll be a long one
'Cause if I sold weight, I'd be Upstate
In the penile, waitin' for a break
'Cause sellin' drugs is for handicaps
I got too many skills besides bustin' rough raps
If I go to jail, it won't be for sellin' keys
It'll be for murderin' MC's
The beat'll take over your heart, then I start
To cut 'em in half, 'cause rhymes are razor sharp
Secure the exits, all MC's remain
'Cause we got a crowd to entertain
And I know, when I go, I'll flow dangerous
Brains'll bust, what you trying to explain to us?
You got lost, and couldn't go on
Came up short, so here's one to grow on
Elevate off a high IQ
In time, you'll find I'm true
'Cause once I start on a piece of art
From sun to moon and light to dark, I build the Ark
Now you can float off the rhymes I wrote
I'm sure that we'll hit shore without a boat
You could bring a battleship and still get shipwrecked
Attacked with a torpedo, what did you expect?
Driftin' up the creek, without a beat or a paddle
Castaway on a raft and stand fragile
Rescue your crowd, which ain't a hard job
Me and my knowledge put together, I'm a lifeguard
Dealin' with actual facts and solar fact
Here and now, but I go so far back
To bring you up to date, so we can elevate
It's no time to wait or anticipate
'Cause I'm never late, I'm gonna motivate
So I can let 'em break, and set 'em straight1Embed
Back to the lab

Now try to do this step
And make sure the pace is kept
And this ain't as smooth as I'mma get
Nice and easy but hard to catch on to
Move with melodies, rhymes to respond to
The mic's in front of me, so you know it's gonna be
Rough and rugged, plus I'm smooth as I wanna be
I'm something like sipping on Dom Perignon
So absorb the song, til the rhyme's all gone
My beats and speech original, you can't find these
Eighty-nine is mine, so is the nineties
Telling you what you need to know and more
You're unsure? On tour, I explore
From street to street, to speak, from beat after beat
My cipher's complete, when I build with people I meet
So here's the info straight from the source in fact
Paid the cost to be the boss, step back
Give me room to exercise the mind
360 degrees'll be fine
The weight of the world is what we hold
That's a six, followed by twenty-one zeroes
Six sextillion tons is a lot of weight
My truth is the strength and my thought won't break
What it take, concentration, to rebuild our
Nation but we got to have mind power
And we can make it work, because I know we can
And if something go wrong, make another plan
It's up to us, so strive and be wise and
When we reach the top, don't stop rising
And I'll keep coming up with more of
The most requested songs that you all love
Reach out and touch the mic, take control
Still getting paid and I still got soul
And the only thing I ever wanted you to follow was poetry
Mind takes X-rays, so listen closely
From the darkness came the light, clear out of a dark night
Now I'm here to spark the mic
Send out truth, for other groups and substitutes
With run-on rhymes and weak dubs and loops
They'd rather hear the arsonist, they insist
No need to reminisce, see if you can step to this
You might also like
Just step, the rhymes create energy
Charged up, by the cut, and it's sending me
For a trip through the mind so I can locate
A laid back rap at a slow rate
It ain't hard at all, cause I invented it
As the days go on, you hear them with it
Brother busting brain cells, thinking of a rap
With the same old style, we had enough of that
We all need something to step to
And don't forget to, cause I won't let you
Dance without hoping that this come on next
And if it go off, the DJ can't flex
Cause here's the tempo, I'mma regulate the pace
Here's the step, go find some space
And what we gonna do is in unison, kick
Shake your head, you're influenced with music
By now you're intoxicated, cause I prove I made it
The pep your step so soon you get rejuvenated
From side to side, you pause and clap
But if you came to rap.. (step back)1Embed
I'm the Alpha with no Omega
Beginnin' without the end, so play the
Ironside, no extended version
Next episode'll be smooth as a Persian
Rhymes everlastin', there'll be no part 2
Knowledge is infinite, once I start to
Draw a better picture for your third eye, if you're blind
You know with a mic, I'm a black Michaelangelo
I'm the brother who ideas are colorful
Givin' 'em insight, but givin' 'em trouble to
Comprehend 'cause their thoughts won't blend in
They're pretendin', while I'm extendin'
You bite like a parasite, static when you attach
But you won't strike 'cause you ain't no match
You need more light 'cause yours got dim
Then you get sparked by the Lord Rakim
What's the matter, G? Check your battery
Go get charged up, then come battle me
You try hard and die hard, you ain't ever ready
When they check your pulse, you'll be dead as Freddie
Shop in Sears for new ideas
Check your engine and ask your engineers
To equalize it, try to disguise it
If that don't work, yo, then Midasize it
You need more power, better bring Battlecat
But this ain't Grayskull, and you ain't rippin', Jack
Don't drop the mic and jet for your tooley
("Bring it to me!")
We can go rhyme for rhyme til the mic stop workin'
Then I'mma leave you behind the Iron Curtain
And you'll remain backstage
Your book is over, I ripped your last page
Changed the endin', at least you went out rappin'
Now, I'mma tell 'em what happened
I filled the mic with explosives and lit it up
It was too heavy to hold, he couldn't pick it up
Pass the mic, let him try to get paid
He hit the stage, it went off like a hand grenade
Now, scrape him off the floor and off my list
I ain't a soloist, I'm an arsonist
Sprayed him, he said he was gonna do what?
Played him, MC Grand Pooh-Butt
Stole his lady, and drove her crazy
You asked me why, 'cause her man tried to play me
I sent her back a nervous wreck
And tried to put her back in check
My specialty is masterin' the female species
I specialize in her, until she sees
Where I come from and why I came
I tame and train til she manifest my name
Fill her with life until she burst with energy
Then leave her restless, 'cause a lot of women be
Tryin' to drain us, and leave us stripped dry
Put holes in our pocket, but you ain't that fly
I clipped your wings and bring you down to Earth
And tell you what life is worth
It ain't rings and things that's materialistic
You wanna pip on, imperialist with
Food for thought, 'cause I'm your shelter
I'll be your clothes, keep you warm and help ya
Not to be hot to trot, why haunt?
And why do y'all got to flaunt?
("We gonna use what we got to get what we want")
Cool, I heat you up like a black mink coat
Hug your neck like a fat gold rope
Words I speak and my DJ's cuts will warm your ears
Like mink earmuffs
So, Eric, show 'em how fast your hands'll go
So the people in the stands'll know
That you don't scratch your cuts engrave
Moves in waves to my rhyme displays
Float, evoke, my tempo jets
Expressions express when you kick steps
Keep 'em energetic, so let it
Pound in your head til what I said is embedded
Don't forget it's copacetic, set it
Anywhere you want, your poetry's pathetic
You gets no credit til you get it straight
Let's motivate
No intermissions 'cause it ain't commercial
If you wanna break, then I'll reimburse you
I won't let go so my mic won't drop, 'cause...
("I can't stop!")
Vocabs is endless, vocals exist
Rhyme goes on, so no one can stop this
Especially when I start to say the
Rhymes with no Omega

This is poetry in motion
Try to catch on, stay close to the host and
Emcees try to make the road rough but I'm coasting
Ladies hear the rhymes, rub 'em on like lotion
Hit the spot soothing, can't stop moving
Go ahead bust a sweat and you can bet I'm still cooling
When I detain it's a brainstorm
Never the same form, every brain I rained on is warm
Taking a trip through memory lane to melody
See if you could tell if these thoughts the fella sees
Could do you justice, but you can't touch this
Some kid just tried to bust this but he just missed
I'm universal and much more merciful
So versatile with the style it's reversible
I get away even if I say a curse or two
First, let me bust another verse for you
Your arms too short to box with Ra so quit
You don't want no kind of conflict
Or you'll get stripped as the rhyme is ripped
Pick up the pieces, now ain't that peace, yeah I'm hip
Everything I said flows since my intro
I plant a thought, extend and then grow
Holding my pen tightly it might be
Controversy at first when I write the
Chords of research, don't just take it for granted
When I'm gone my mind remains a planet
If I keep building, and teach the children
So when they read in between the lines it's filled in
I break to meditate, not a peep, concentrate
Till I'm deep awake, but not asleep
At the same time rising and advertising
What is true, keep advising you to stay wise
And I'm untouchable
You might also like
Coming over the bridge, take a peak at the skyline
'Cause that's how I shine, not only when I rhyme
My culture's making me stronger, mentally
Physically I'm powerful, poetry I invent'll be
Labelled as art, placed in a museum
Style'll make scenery, now you see 'em
Exhibit a knowledge that's packed and filled with
Nothing illiterate, it's facts I build with
My mind's untouchable which means intangible
Contents never dense, it's understandable
I study life so I can live it the right way
No time to hear what another brother might say
Why sell a capsule of crack? I don't have to
I rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to
Put message on records that's braced with hard bass
Smuggling microphones, this ain't Scarface
Whoever talked that talk, I wanna hawk
And don't try to escape from New York
Across a 110th Street looking for a problem
It's hell up in Harlem, watch Ra solve 'em
I hear the music clear as I get near
The 125th Street Apollo Theater
Take a step back when I rap and step up to you
I'm untouchable
Put on my thinking cap, pump the track
Test your reflex, relax but in contact
You fold and lose control so hold your partner closer
You're supposed to keep your composure
But you hear the drumset go then it gets so hype
It's like nitro, opponents get petro
Remember the trademark left by the R
That's never soft or smooth, it's coming off the hardest
In effect, you could detect the imposter
Taking my props, Rakim is still proper
I'm a prophet, you can't stop it when I drop it
Everything I say coincide with the topic
Thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured
Inside my brain it's all manufactured
As we go deeper it's hard to find
Don't even think about it, 'cause you can't read my mind
It's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined
In the mind with some kind of idea for
The style I'm advertising what is true
Keep advising you to stay wise and the mind
Is untouchableEmbed

I'm the arsenal, I got artillery, lyrics are ammo
Rounds of rhythm, then I'ma give 'em piano
Bring a bullet-proof vest, nothin' to ricochet
Ready, aim at the brain, now what the trigger say
Tempos trifle, felt like a rifle
Massage and melodies might go right through
Simultaneously like an Uzi, nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up, when lady say don't lose me
So reload quickly, and you better hit me
While I'm lettin' this fifi get with me
You steppin' with double oh seven, better make it snappy
No time to do your hair baby, brothers are bustin' at me
Beats and bullets pass me, none on target
They want the R hit, but watch the God get
Quicker, the tongue is the trigger, 'cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em, let 'em feel the blast
Penetrate at a crazy rate, this ain't no .38
Hit 'em at point blank range, and watch 'em radiate
Runnin' out of ammunition, I'm done with 'em
You ask me how I did 'em? I let the rhythm hit 'em

Let it hit 'em
You might also like
I push a power that's punishin' , prepare to be a prisoner
The hit man is the, brother with charisma
Showing you that I have, powerful paragraphs
Followers become leaders, but without a path
Ya mentally paralyzed, crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred, then it occurred that you heard I
Reduced the friction, with crucifixion
Let loose the mix then, boost the piston
Eric, hit 'em with some of that cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back, it won't be none of that
I'm untouchable, you see me in 3D
When I let the rhythm hit another emcee
Lyrics made of lead, enters your head
Then eruption of a mass production will spread
When music is louder, full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery, when I see a crowd of
Party people, pumpin' their fist like this
Ya hide in the back, thinkin' that I might miss
But the R is accurate, plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines that I have to hit
Whatever I aim at, I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain, that time is up
You been hit with somethin' different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate, nothing's equivalent
Nothin' can harm me, why tryin' bar me?
You couldn't fuck around the Ra with an army
You'll get wrecked by the architect, so respect him
I disconnect 'em, soon as I inject 'em, with radiation
Put 'em by the basement, bust his chest open
Bash his face in, let it split him
Since he brought his main man with him
He ask me how I did 'em? I let the rhythm hit 'em
Let it hit 'em

Dance floor's dangerous, packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme, beats with deep bass
Girls with tight pants, maybe they might dance
Tonight if the R's on the mic, there's a slight chance
The crowd is crucial, MC's grounds are neutral
Now that you're here, let me introduce you
Get ready, I'm hard to read like graffiti
But steady, science I drop is real heavy
Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail, on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour, now it's a habit
Ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention: follow directions, real close
Keep out of reach of children, beware of overdose
Too many milligram, no one made an iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts that kill a man
Ideas for the ear to fear, might split him
He'll never forget 'em, he'll rest in peace with 'em
At least when he left, he'll know what hit him
The last breath of the words of death, was the rhythm

Let it hit 'em
Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know, they'll blow the hell up
If I slow up they'll catch up, hell no
Wicked as I kicked it, don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it, reversed and switched it
To perform to perfection, section for section
Rhymes keep connectin', ya guessin' what's next and
Blood pressure rises, ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin', and woke up frostbit
'Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain, hit a vein, then remain
Let it radiate, vibes will vibrate, why did you violate?
Now I'ma have to let the style break
Moans now, the tone is ingrown
After this gets thrown, gimme another microphone
Before I get that, fifi I met
Whisper "I wanna reach her intellect"
Kiss her, 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let my light reflect
Hold her, mold her, make her feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure, whenever I'm with her
And you know how I did her, me and the rhythm hit her9Embed

I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder, damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffiti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration 'cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
Competing 'cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours
I wake you up, and as I stare in your face, you seem stunned
Remember me? The one you got your idea from?
But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher
When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of
Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke

I got a question as serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack? Nobody smiling
'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it, so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits
Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours
The E-M-C-E-E, don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those seven emcees
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar
I'll wait 'til E say, "Play 'em"
So I'ma have to diss and broke
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke
I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation 'cause what I invent
I nominated my DJ for president
When I emcee, I'll keep a freestyle going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
There'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiending
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the moral of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
'Cause I'm moving the crowd, and B'll wreck the fader
No interruptions, and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
'Cause everything is real, on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And I'll take you for a walk through hell
Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple-stage darkness
When it get dark again, then I'ma spark this microphone
'Cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finished when the beat is gone, I'm no joke34Embed
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

Let's trace the hits and check the file
Let's see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass 'til MCs get weak
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep
'Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a President's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MCs wanna beef, then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique

Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped and wrecked
But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to labs to observe 'em
They couldn't absorb 'em, they didn't deserve 'em
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
Because of my culture, I'm equipped to construct the
Technical styles that'll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak, just seek
And peep the technique

Never sweat the technique

I speak indiscreet 'cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old, techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new 'cause it's real
And in a while the style’ll have much more value
Classical, too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs
For all the years, you fought and sought the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique
Never sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique15Embed

Sip the juice, I got enough to go around
And the thought takes place Uptown
I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk
And then taught to hawk New York
I go to Queens for queens, then get the crew from Brooklyn
Make money in Manhattan and never been tooken
Go Uptown in The Bronx to Boogie Down
Get Strong on the Island, recoup and lay around
Time to build my juice back up
Props stack up, suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Shakin' 'em up, wakin' 'em up
Breakin' 'em up, rakin' 'em up
Standin' on shaky ground too close to the edge
Let's see if I Know the Ledge

Corner's triflin' 'cause shorty's here
I get cock-D liftin' forties of beer
Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
If I get revenge, then they rest in peace
Somebody gotta suffer, I just might spare one
And give a brother a fair one
Stay alert and on P's, and I do work with these like Hercules
Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw
'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall
Smooth, but I move like an army
Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
Puttin' brothers to rest like Eliot Ness
'Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't the place for innocent bystanders to stand
Nothing's gonna stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino, kill like De Niro
Black Gambino, die like a hero
Livin' on shaky grounds, too close to the edge
Let's see if I Know the Ledge

Shells lay around on the battleground
Dead bodies are found throughout the town
Try to put shame in my game to make a name
I'mma put it on a bullet, put it in your brain
Rip the block like a buckshot
Who cares where it goes? Just keep the casket closed
No remorse when a life is lost
I paid my dues, paid the cost
And my pockets are still fat
Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat
Even if my crew is steep, I'm one deep
I attract attention, people like to peep
So come say hi to the bad guy
Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die
'Cause I get loose and I got troops, and crazy juice
In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini
Hang out with Smith and Wess', don't try to play me
I'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat
But no warnin' shot, my gun is warm a lot
When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear
Areas in fear 'cause this here's severe
Livin' life too close to the edge
Hopin' that I Know the Ledge

A brand new morn', no time to yawn
Shower's on, power's on
Late for school, I catch the train
Girls sip the style and whisper my name
I push up like an exercise
Check they intellect and inspect the thighs
Select the best one, pull her to the side
Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
Read her my résumé, she know already? Cool
Just meet me after school
We can moan and groan until your moms come home
And you'll be callin' me Al "Dope" Capone
Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose
Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice
'Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety
'Cause a lot of niggas hate me
Comin' out of the building, they set me up
Sprayed with automatics, they wet me up
In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge
I guess I didn't Know the Ledge17Embed
I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
'Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say, "Yes, y'all"
They tried to take it and say that I'm too small
Cool 'cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet (Then I jet)
Back to the lab without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the other one, then I make another one
To this the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a cravin' like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm ragin', rippin' up the stage and
Don't it sound amazin'?
'Cause every rhyme is made and thought of
'Cause it's sort of an addiction
Magnetized by the mixing
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in
The mic is a Drano, volcanoes eruptin'
Rhymes overflowin', gradually growin'
Everything is written in the cold, so it can coincide ('Cide)
My thoughts to guide
Forty-eight tracks to slide
The invincible, microphone fiend, Rakim (Rakim)
Spread the word 'cause I'm in
E-F-F-E-C-T
A smooth operator operating correctly
But back to the problem, I got a habit
You can't solve it, silly rabbit
The prescription is a hyper tone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin (Heroin)
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Give me a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness, beware, it's the re-animator (Re-animator)
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'
You'll see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend
After twelve, I'm worse than a gremlin
Feed me hip-hop and I start tremblin' (Tremblin')
The thrill of suspense is intense, you're horrified
But this ain't the cinemas of 'Tales From the Darkside'
By any means necessary, this is what has to be done
Make way 'cause here I come
My DJ cuts material (Material)
Grand imperial
It's a must that I bust any mic you hand to me
It's inherited, it runs in the family
I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back
If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack
Now I don't wanna have to let off, you should've kept off
You didn't keep the stage warm, step off (Step off)
Ladies and gentleman, you're about to see
A pastime hobby about to be
Taken to the maximum, I can't relax, see
I'm hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, somethin' you can't smoke
More than dope, you're tryin' to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should've backed up
For those that act up, need to be more than smacked up
Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber
One-on-one and I'm the remainder (Remainder)
So close your eyes and hold your breath (Breath)
And I'ma hit you with the blow of death (Death)
Before you go, you'll remember you seen
The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend (I'm the microphone fiend)
