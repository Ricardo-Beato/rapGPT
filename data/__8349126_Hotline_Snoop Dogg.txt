Who are you gonna call when you need a fix? (Yes)
Yeah, oh, in October, babe, I'm goin', I'm goin' (You can give us a call)

Do you like when I touch your body like this? (Yes, yes, yes)
Oh, you like it, baby (1-800-Dr-Bombay, hollar)
Ooh, girl, I like it, baby

I'm takin' off work, just to make some love to you
You've been such a flirt, I can know you're takin' you
Oh, your body, babe, yeah, on top of my—
Oh, your body, babe, since you wanna, wanna die
Lookin' at your body, I would move you like this (Like this)
Lookin' at your body, I could give you one kiss (Mwah)
Takin' my time down your milky way (Yeah)
I wanna lay my rocket on your sweet planet (I got you singin', bae)

I wonder why (Dr. Bombay)
