1 ContributorSmile  (Mixtape) Lyrics
(Classic) That's right it's a motherfuckin classic!
Yeah... yeah... it's 50 nigga!... Yeah... yeah... yeah. Yeah

Smile nigga my next album might be my last
Got what I came to get, the stacks and the stash
I told Jimmy Iovine ass to shut the fuck up
Got Dre callin' Shady sayin Em what's up?
We done came this far, we can't stop now
Em, 50 off the hook, he got to calm down
I guess I'm out of control, my mind, body and soul
Tell me I'm bein pimped and it's makin me sick
You know Em made that company over a billion dollars
And when he ain't around they sayin foul shit about him
Yeah we fucked up, we both don't know our pops
We both don't like the cops, we don't know when to stop
You know Kim is Shaniqua and Hailey is Marquise
D-12's G-Unit and we always in beef
Ja and Fred Durst, both of them jerks
Got put out the game, ha, ha, ya lames!
Paul's Chris Lighty, Tracy's Nicki Martin
Boxes of ox, sarge is a Glock
My nine is twenty four seven on watch

Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know Oprah got In Da Club on her iPod
She don't want me on her show though I guess I'm too hard
She sat Kanye West down, and talked about his crash
But she don't wanna talk about the bullets in my ass
Spike Lee don't like it that my money come fast
I hate it when a nigga get to countin my cash
Now I can give the kids a positive message like Farrakhan
Or I can give 'em pistols and targets to squeeze 'em on
I'm tryin to make a decision damn, leave me alone
I'm like Martin Luther King people listen to me a lot
It's non violent, non violent till I'm hit with a rock
Then it's Coretta fuck this, go and get me my Glock
Wanna call me crazy? Okay it's cool
I'll have your kids tryin to be, crazy cool in school
Truth is they like me, more than they like you
They watch me and emulate, everything I do

Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I have days when I feel like everybody's against me
Sharpton ain't comin when the feds snatch 50
Just my luck Johnnie Cochran passed
Right before the crackers come snatch my ass
I'm the Don King of crack, the Pretty Floyd of rap
Put Southside on the map, I did that
Bill O'Reilly can't stand me but his woman think I'm cute
I bet she wanna see me in my birthday suit
Met Al Gore and his wife in them first class seats
She said she didn't like rap until she met me
You gotta understand I'm a charmin young man
A whole lot has changed since I went hand to hand
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Should be happy, ya know?, I just want you to be happy
Smile for me! If I gotta go away to make you feel better
I'll go away! Ya know? I got what I came to get
My money right, ya nah mean I'm good don't worry 'bout me I'm good
Ya know? This is about you now, is it 'gon make you happy to see me gone?
Are you gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Are you just gonna forget about me? I meant nothin to you?
Is that what you sayin to me?
Cause ya breakin my heart...
Hahaha, I mean you're really breakin my heartEmbed
