It's Lil' Kim, the one they all love and hate
The Queen's back, bitches, regurgitate
I got these hoes real sick like a stomach ache
Blue-faced Rollies, animals on my vertebrae
We out the country, nah, we don't do States
Married to the game, nah, we don't do dates
I'm eatin' good, but I gotta watch my weight
Fourteen carats in my salad gold plate (Hahaha)
I treat the track like a bedpan
I got ill thoughts, need a head scan
Got that old money like the Bread Man
That's why these bitches all rotten like a dead man
From London to Italy, Romania to France
I'm diplomat status, check the passport stamps
You hoes is pathetic, faker than prosthetics
Somebody call the paramedics
You might also like
I got these hoes real sick 'cause the flow real sick
They at the show real sick, front row, real sick
Queen Bee real sick, Lil' Kim is phenomenal
The ass real sick and the pussy's phenomenal
The swag real sick, Birkin bag real sick (Uh)
Jimmy Choos real sick (D-block), Bentley coupes real sick (L-O-X)
Queen Bee real sick, Lil' Kim is phenomenal (Aha, uh, yeah, yo)

No fake shit, permanent realness (Real)
The minute that you feel this, it's terminal illness (Ill)
Incurable, they ain't able to heal this (Uh-uh)
All I ever try to do is give you the real 'Kiss (Muah)
Let it off, then we fleeing the scene
They ain't see us, but they heard that it was me and the Queen (Yup)
I got this Tom Ford shit on and she in McQueen (Woo)
Think I'm going colorblind, 'cause all I see is the green
Money ain't worth counting if it ain't done properly (Uh-uh)
House on the mountain, V12s on the property (Yup)
Cup full of drink, big Dutch full of broccoli (Woo)
Cancer on the track, even Dre can't doctor me (Uh-uh)
No penicillin (Nah), no antibiotic (Nope)
Just the Purple Haze, lil' something exotic
Booth or the barrel, quicker to the cabbage (Yeah)
Al-Qaeda Jada, sicker than your average
And you know I'm real sick (What?), chain got 'em real sick (What?)
Game got 'em real sick, my name got 'em real sick
I been had 'em real sick 'cause my bars is phenomenal
Yeah (Real sick), I'm nothing like y'all, I'm phenomenal
You know I'm real sick (What?), chain got 'em real sick
Game got 'em real sick (What?), my name got 'em real sick
I been had 'em real sick 'cause my bars is phenomenal2Embed
