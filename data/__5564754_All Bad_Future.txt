It's Lil Uzi Vert
Let's go
Yeah (Ayy, Brandon, man, why you do that?)
One, two, three, hello (Woah)

I won't never call back, if I hang up, I mean it, yeah
That mean it was all bad, I think I'm better off leavin', yeah
I don't have time for stressin', no more time for disagreements, no
Too many girls, what you call that? Got 'em all in line, they fiendin', yeah

Yeah, I got too many type of girls, yeah
I'm from a whole different world, yeah
I got one shine in the light, yeah
She remind me of a pearl, yeah
I am way smarter than you, uh
You chase the nut like a squirrel, yeah
Drinkin' that pineapple juice, yeah
I throw it up, never hurl, yeah

My nickname Young Spend It
I get the money, get that by the plenty (Woah)
Used to go to Starlets to see Cayy Benji, uh
Now I got YellowDol on me (Me)
You can't get this style for free
Look at me, uh, bad bitch on me
Yeah, my bitch rock all Fenty
Got a bitch look just like RiRi (What else?)
Christian Dior all on my feet
Pull up a suit, that shit a three-piece
That girl say she a vegan, but I swear
That girl still know how to eat meat
Why you keep talkin' about leavin' me?
I ain't never been to DR
And I ain't never been to the Republics
On a long ass flight, can't get no sleep
Broke ass nigga can't talk to me
That's the reason why I put diamonds in my teeth
I get money for so long that I'm countin' this paper in my dream
Everything I get turn to brûlée
So your bitch pull up 'til I make her cream
And you know I do this shit just for myself
But you know I do this shit just for my team
You might also like
I won't never call back, if I hang up, I mean it, yeah
That mean it was all bad, think I'm better off leavin', yeah
I don't have time for stress, I don't have time for disagreements, yeah
Too many girls 'posed to call back, I got 'em all in line, they fiendin', yeah

I got too many different type of girls, yeah
I'm from a whole different world, yeah
I got one shine in the light, uh
She remind me of a pearl, yeah
I am way smarter than you, uh
You chase a nut like a squirrel, yeah
Drinkin' that wine, off a two, uh
I throw it up, never hurl, yeah (Oh my God)

I got too many type of girls, yeah
I got a whole lot of flavors, yeah
Fuck around, fuck on my neighbor's friend
I think she just might been Arabian
I already fixed me a visa, yeah
She eat it up, know I'm a beast
I know I been leanin', I know she been dreamin'
I can make her dreams come true, yeah
Baby, that don't mean I blew off her roofs
I drip drip, made the pussy get loose
Might be in a Tom panini suits
And she got Cha-nay-nay on her too
When I'm in Tom Ford and I'm in the strip club
Can't let the cheap pussy get too close
I just spent twenty thousand dollars on my outfit
And I had a bitch pullin' up in the Ghost
Niggas see the wrist when it flick and it's froze
If I hang up, don't call back at all
Switched up lens and I switched my broad
I'll never switch up on my dawgs
I can tell the real from the fake and the fraud
One-three-hundo sit in the garage
Rather tell the truth, but I know it's gon' hurt
Had to put a little bitty bitch on a shirt, for sure-ski
I won't never call back, if I hang up, I mean it, yeah (For sure-ski)
That mean it was all bad, I think I'm better off leavin', yeah
I don't have time for stress, I don't have time for disagreements, yeah
Too many girls 'posed to call back, I got 'em all in line, they fiendin', yeah

Yeah, I got too many type of girls, yeah
I'm from a whole different world, yeah
I got one shine in the light, yeah
She remind me of a pearl, yeah
I am way smarter than you, uh
You chase the nut like a squirrel, yeah
Drinkin' that pineapple juice, yeah
I throw it up, never hurl, yeah

I won't never call back, if I hang up, I mean it, yeah
That mean it was all bad, oh my God
I don't have time for stressin', no more time for disagreements, no
Too many girls, what you call that? (Let's go)

I got too many different type of girls, yeah (Woah)
I'm from a whole different world, yeah
I got one shine in the light, uh
She remind me of a pearl, yeah
I am way smarter than you, uh
You chase the nut like a squirrel, yeah
Drinkin' that wine, off a two, uh
I throw it up, never hurl, yeah20Embed
