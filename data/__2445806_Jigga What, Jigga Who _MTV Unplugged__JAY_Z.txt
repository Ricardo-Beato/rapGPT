We operating a six now we gotta get all the way to ten
In order to get there I know what I gotta do
We gotta split the room up right now
Everybody on that side, you know what I'm saying y'all say Jigga What
Everybody on that side y'all say Jigga Who
Y'all gotta wait though I'm tell you when

Mo'uckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous
Shots with the fo'-fo'
Cats wanna talk to po-po's
Smoke em like coco
Not rap, coke by the boatload
Not that on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your nonsense
Glock with the full clip
Y'all cats better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See a cat laying shocked when the fool hit
Oh hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you
But see me I wanna love for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, til you say Jay Z you're too much for me

Got a condo with nothing but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowing on my last cassette
Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a Tec, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Cats hating and shit cause I Jayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're, acting raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your broad, wanna marry your broad
Now she's mad at me cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimp - what a tragedy
She wanted, us to end cause I touched her friend
She gave me one more chance and I touch her again
I seen her tears as she busted in
I said shit
There's a draft
Shut the door ma and come on in

(Jigga what)
Flow with me

Yo
Got a vendetta even though I been better
Left him in the cold with a thin sweater
Rap cats on Prozac get the bozack, cats threw
Two at me I threw fo' back, hold that
Let the dough stack
Way before Big had the gold Ac
Dame had the Lex black
Cats wanna test that, stress that
And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at
I suggest that niggas invest in a vest when I come through
With the Glock jet black you niggas step back
I'm the best at you know I ain't no apprentice to this
Me and my niggas we invented the shhh
I came into the business with this
The Originator, none greater
Roots band drop that shhhhEmbed
