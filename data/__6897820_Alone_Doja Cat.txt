Baby, when you fought me at the door
Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?

Now I barely need ya
Do what you do best and be alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die alone
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be alone

Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to let you wander
Now you're an afterthought, I lost ya
And now you want me, babe
You want me, but it's bye
Givin' mе reasons to fly
Pack up my shit and be wise
Jump in thе ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like, look what you threw to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you're right
I'm out my mind
Doesn't make sense when I cry
If we can't make up, 'least we try
You might also like
Baby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone? (Yeah)

I ain't wanna share my dreams when it involves you
Not the man I need (Yeah)
Started feelin' like I failed my team
Missin' gigs for you, bet you never felt like me
Different levels to the game, that's fast
Spendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap (Yeah)
Lonely at the top while your ass miles deep
Got me thinkin' that you scared of yourself, not me
Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need a answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than 'needs control,' cherish it

Baby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?
Now I barely need ya (I barely need ya)
Do what you do best and be alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die alone
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be alone
Alone
Now you scared to be alone30Embed
