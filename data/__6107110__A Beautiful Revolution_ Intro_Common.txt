13 Contributors(A Beautiful Revolution) Intro Lyrics
Ain't it beautiful?
When we smile, it's a musical
An act of revolution and the stage is a human one
Some people spend their lives wearing the costume
When the script is Sanskrit in the palms of our worship
The same hands we go to work with
The same hands we go to work with, put the real work in
Meditation and stillness so your focus is the realest
Screaming from the outskirts when your voice is the clearest
Wishing for answers inside of elections
When justice was just born right inside your reflection
Here we stand, survivors of holocausts
Oceans of bodies, bound and lost
Our dreams swam across
Found the will to still live at all costs
The true mastery itself, honoring tears
Loving the mirror beyond your greatest fears
A small army traveling beneath your skin
Walking alone if you need to, the revolution's within
Our bodies birth sons wrapped around Earth's axis
Spinning the way people do when change is necessary action
Our ancestors saw us in the future
Imperfect perfect beams of light
A sacred prophecy of what's possible, be still, and still the night
We are centuries of grace
The internal uprising, the creation of race
The spiritual warfare is the one you can win
An army of angels begin where we end
We beautiful broken, warrior ready in soulhood
The wish and the wish you would
The daughter of drum spangled banners
We are the tearing down, are falling together
Our cosmos, our stars, a subtle peace
Ain't it a miracle to simply feel safe?
