3 ContributorsSoldier Lyrics
I keep a shooter with a ruger that'll put the metal to you
Wanna swim with the sharks,  barracuda
 Imma do ya
I'll jump out the helicopter, like a paratrooper
Double duse  Imma tell the truth
If you move,  Imma cock and shoot
 bag in the stash,  full of threats
 bag ,  for your hat
 I'm telling ya
You beef with Brick Squad, you better be intelligent
 Conetikit
 my niggas bring that 
And If I cannot catch you, then I'll knock  relatives
 tryna get 

 this motherfucker straight 
Everybody know, they can see it in your eye
It's easy to assume, 
 already know that you're ready to die
 soldiers, soldiers
You wouldn't get it, you ain't a soldier, soldier
You understand, you a soldier, soldier
So you ain't playing, you a soldier, soldier
You might also like
Like a soldier in Afganastan or Packastan or 
I will use vilants, cause Gucci do not give a damn
When it's hot  blood clot  a lot
 rude boy
 rolling joints  joint
And I'm  give them what they want
 you are not a G, your career's over
But I show that  soldier

 this motherfucker straight 
Everybody know, they can see it in your eye
It's easy to assume, 
 already know that you're ready to die
 soldiers, soldiers
You wouldn't get it, you ain't a soldier, soldier
You understand, you a soldier, soldier
So you ain't playing, you a soldier, soldierEmbed
