46 ContributorsDance 4 Eternity Lyrics
Hey, it's so hard to trust anyone
Hmm, so this is awesome
You got me smilin', yeah you're a lot of fun
Hmm, so this is awesome
I wanna dance with you for eternity
Sure like to see that body wet
Ooh, sure like to see that body wet
Let's make moments we couldn't possibly forget

What a pleasure, so much pleasure
Explore the moment, savor the moment
Our bodies, puzzle piece
You're excited, I can feel you dripping
Drippin', drippin'
Ooh, I love to see that body wet
Hmm, don't be shy with it
Hard to trust anyone anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Yeah, you're a lot of fun, a lot of fun, a lot of fun, a lot of fun
Dance for eternity, eternity, eternity, eternity, eternity, eternity
Ooh, sure like to see that body wet, that body wet
You couldn't possibly forget, forget
