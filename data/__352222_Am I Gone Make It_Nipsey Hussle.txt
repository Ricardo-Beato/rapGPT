7 ContributorsAm I Gone Make It Lyrics
Yeah
Hey if you hear me breathing kind of hard
Fresh off some push-ups, ya know
Uh, uh, yeah, uh, that's right
That's right
Uh, Hussle, look

Am I gon' make it am I gon' fail
And if I don't try, then how I'm gon' tell
They say that it's heaven, they say that it's hell
But we stuck here 'til we get there
Try to have more faith and less fear
Try to express it to your peers
I'm talking 'bout dreams
Better to do it and let it be seen, cause then it's so clear
Look at them flock, isn't it weird
Niggas is groupies, borderline queer
Fuck it, that's the nature of success, we all hold it so dear
How could you judge one if you was once one
Nigga that might one day become somebody
Who made good on his word and transcends where he come from
Nevertheless still come 'round, show face to motivate these young ones
Niggas will never give you credit, none
Some questions go unanswered, most of those I give to God
Some niggas can't be reasoned with, those gon' meet the squad
Normal nowadays, my life is anything but besides
It's a cold and lonely road, I knew it when I took the job
Progress on my heart, money on my mind
I got Rimpau at my CD changer, smokin' while I drive
Nigga, uh
You might also like
It's not really about how you start, it's not about the lane
It's about the overall race
That's one of the reasons why
I'm a marathon runner2Embed
