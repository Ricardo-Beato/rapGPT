I'm— trust me, I'm— trust me, I'm trying to help
I'm— trust me, I'm— trust me, I'm trying to help

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, "I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt"
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, "That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!"

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass

Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, "Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go"
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass
You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help
Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, "Enough's enough!"
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass90Embed
Check it out y'all
Pull the pin
Count to five
Top to bottom tonight
Borough watch, Jux war(?)
Savage, overkill
Definitive, red carpet
Cupcakes, iced right now
On time

Same hand that snuggled the barbed wire
Tug an orphan assortment of bell and three-alarm fire
Beautiful loser maneuver the goofy cubicle future alert
Big brother super-community burn
OK shoppers, tickets won't last
For the straight-to-video "Dog-Boy eats glass"
Who BMX match rotate on guerilla Babylon
Darwin on a peg taking his innervate to tag along
Ape escape gravitron, surly with two caps
One over the mask while plugging the flak back(?)
And it was, home depot for the five finger lazy lift
Ironically the same five measure the spray radius
Spray gradient, baiting for city tetris
Double-breasted hecklers bark at picket fences
Now mobile rogues develop a special network
Which further upsets the rich 'til rubberneckers double-check us
(Zero)
Tonight the scum dance and I got all my money on the one with the lung cramps
Little rat in the maze, they score him on his escape
Sorta likes the attention so he says check-in and stays
Answer: how do we record a documentarian suffering
While ushering the public's hands in
Or transfer greedy bruiser to user-friendly stanzas?
I guess it's like a junkwad full of dondy's candice
Product, Noun: a tampered-with, contaminated shrink-wrapped variant of the process, wow

Used to draw
Hard to admit that I used to draw
Portraiture and the human form
Doodle of a two-headed unicorn—it was soothing
Movin' his arm in a fusion of man-made tools and a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No name nuisance, stews in a bedroom
Oozing a brand-new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole grayscale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour, little bit of backlight
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can't imagine the rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York, five peeps and a dog
In a two-bedroom, doing menial jobs
Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty-year affinity
In rickety condition with an ID crisis
Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's…

Hard to admit that I used to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
It was blooming addiction
Amiss in the pushing of pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look
Pinhead kids of the minute
Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic
And it grew up into linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison, voice of the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
Redo that, move that inward
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can't imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
In proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two, then three, then a month
And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety
Has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy
Aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas
Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's…

Yup! Steps up to the plate
Little brother, Little League, '87—he was 8
Rookie season for the skinny slugger newly out of T-ball
Pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off
Church, then a grip of loons run to third first
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!", nose in her word-search
Seen MILFs like apes on a monolithic bleacher
Into advocating war and peace in lieu of sport and leisure
"Hi, Peggy!" I was 10, chewing on a Sweet Tart
Little brother, left field, queen's guard, mean arm
Knees bent, two out, two on bags
When I caught him staring down at something moving through the grass
Hold up; tagged runner, and the whole cast rotate
Not before he could identify the culprit
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!" Graham yelling, "Gopher!"
New left fielder give a fuck about a homer
Got a homie, little rodent, head and shoulders out his hovel
No baseball in the bubble, ruh-roh
Parents thought it adorable, the players followed suit
Inning crawling to a close, head coach not amused
Coach seeing red, coach on the diamond
Dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him
When he transverse third, the families turn nervous
The following is a transcript of "Man vs. Vermin"
Here we go: man stands out by a hole
Pest pops up to patrol
Man plays live Whac-a-Mole
In a scene that would try every child as adults
Whoa, pall-bore with a ball mitt
Thrown over the fence, coach hit the bench
Both teams lose, "Good game, good game"
Granny yelling "Go Cubs!" Cubs ain't playing

Neubauten tee, plaid flannel-laden, adolescent art kid
Tony Hawk hair, Skinny Puppy denim
And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend, Peel Sessions
In a Christian home for field testing
It's real youth in the palm of your hand
When your mom thinks Satan is involved in a band
We were buried in the Village Voice, checking who was playing where
Pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear
Five words, like a beacon of light in the mist:
"Ministry live at the Ritz"
It was "Christ Has Risen" to Chris, three loaves, two fish
Miracle of mechanized loops on two-inch
Coming to a theater—he would be there in the flesh
Moms didn't say "No," but she didn't say "Yes"
Cop tickets—ah, the plot thickens
Countdown to ultimate concert experience
Ma still wary: "And why are they called Ministry?
Are they a cult?" Maybe she would probably investigate
Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview
Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three
That's all—no fair trial
Simply, "You will not be going to the show, and that's final!"
What occurred next were the top of the lungs
Of a son who, unjustly, had lost what he loved
In a moment that would transcend anger to high art
Said, "This is something I am willing to die for!"
Can you even imagine?
A death in the fam from industrial fandom?
Anyway, no body count, no concert
And Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched Converse

My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun
Troll of the treadmill
Record on the Kessel Run (allegedly)
Edgy from elevenses to Megabucks
Techies with the treble down
This is how we level up
Dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease
As ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys
The coping mechanism in his LMNOP's
Went from healthy to unhealthy to a hell he never leaves
Cineplex Jesus, curse at the curly fries
Mulling over Chuck D telling me, "Diversify"
I'm at the Supercuts soupin' up the wardrobe
Forecast looking like Ganesh on four phones
"Hello, hello, hello, hello"
Base camp, space camp
Bass in your face fuck, brace for the rain dance
Back in the back of the classroom
After a magical nap in a vacuum

Act natural, whatever that means for you

Before climbing douchebag mountain, I was skate or die

Putting on the yoga lady, cutting off The Cable Guy
Whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize

Mentholated Tiger Balm, Aleve with the arthritis cap
Irons and the niacin, iron Quiet Riot mask
Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast
40 winks, never the same adventure
Refreshing, or the single longest exorcism ever
In the end, you gotta wonder if it's even worth the effort
No stairways into Heaven, you can step into the Escher
Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness
It fucked me up for eons, I wished I was a theist
The type to fake his death then forget he faked his death
Show up on TV, in the crowd at the AVNs, like...

Hey peace Aesop uh It's Chuck D
Yo man, you keep doin' what you're doin' man
Keep rhymin' through those walls, alright?
Sometimes I feel my heart putrefying inside my body
From diary of dark to piety in the Ponzi
On my better days they mingle and walk off into the poppy
On my worst, the work is overshadowed by the monte
Had to buy some clothes that fit me
And pretend I like agave
With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley in him
Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars
I'm feeling kinda done, too many moving parts
The piss-poor vision is 40 percent floaters
The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers
The friends you confessed all the dark shit to
Had weaponized the information before we could send roses
And they want a little pearl on how he got to where he at
I can't remember where I am, I feel it's probably a trap
Balk with the lawless, cough in his notes
Walk on even when the walls hug his coat

Act natural, whatever that means for you

The kid that work down at the local Baskin-Robbins
Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar
I watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle
Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel
He asked me what I wanted, I ordered something daft
He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats
Thanks; I like it too but modestly confess
In present company, my coloring is not the main event
Look at that neck
The message is immediate, the guy effs chicks
I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists
So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important
Now some 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar
Got me questioning my morals and their corny pecking order
I should give a shit less
Cherry-No; Whip-Yes

Lotta years
Uh, lotta years

The girl that work down at the local juice place
Got a head full of dreadlocks down to her waist
I watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great
Some lady orders Maca, compliments the locks
She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop
"It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut 'em, kept 'em
Reattach 'em anytime I want 'em"
My mind's fucking blown
The future is amazing, I feel so fucking old
I bet you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work
I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first

Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
It's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants
Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants
Each one separately convinced
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands
Delusion turned the communication to prison camp
You fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
Step out the tempest, a measure of what the spectrum involves
Maybe no one cares
Party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
This song's our echolocation up in impregnable fog
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling
God almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys
Play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art

Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more loss in the wake
I recall thinking, "Someday, someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect"
And I just couldn't fathom blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains and a slew of unique nuances
Nah mean? When you wake up eight years non-responsive
It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack-in-the-box
To a package of clogged up chakras
Oh, shazbat! Not the "ever after" he wanted
From the "Once upon a time, dot, dot, dot"
Once upon a time, he was so much more
Than a punchline for his own potshots, ah
Watch the Impossible Kid
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out, I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether you his moms or his mans
Whether you his pops or his girl, I was poison
Heart full of canines, head full of voices
Whole life trying to quiet 'em down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay
True friendship in a tugboat way
Ae go dark in the face of the fucked
When the fucked was a friend, that was basically done
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook faking of funk, and I can't
Here go the hindsight:
Eight years been one long blindside
I could pinpoint seven more turns that occurred 'cause he never really healed from the first
Oh, what a world, any hack is a myth
Any dap is a joke, any map is a trick
Any graph is a hoax, ease on down

Knowing ain't half the battle

Orange moon, starry night, particle exciters
In a pageant rivaled only by the origin of fire
Now add an organism from alternative environs
A dozen pair of cartoon eyes in a thicket
To see a neophyte get sliced into ribbons
I'm here to pick lice off each other and assimilate
Duck a suit, troubleshoot his moody user interface
True and suckerproof, grew to fully disengage
Float his only vanishing point away from the picture plane
Go to where the radio trails off
And people catch rabies on the way to their mailbox
Under a sideways rain cornering the briar
Still pull a broad sword from a hoarded synthesizer
Nap in a hole in a tree
Cat leaving voles at my feet
Talking Master P, memory foam everything
Jettison the rest and roulette us a new trajectory
Spinal Tap 11, tapping resin out the evergreen

Keep the pets inside, notify your contacts

New Salem
Brave new voodoo
Wave a witch hammer in a haven for the woo woo
I'm paper china dinner, mostly picking at my stitches
The bloody hair, bad code, bunny ears, dad jokes
Bitch about Lamictal to whichever vixen listen
The skin rash, the schism, a million rash decisions
In truth, he had a capital T terrible 2 days
That chewed his plumage to the root
And proved a prequel to malaise
A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face
He'd been replaying the scenario for days
With the variables replaced
Meh

Part riot, part Orion
We jarred a lot of lightning up
Shook a turkey leg or 10

A third party, who was incidentally not Alex
Seen a bear put a thousand chickens in a pot with carrots

Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Whatcha doing there
Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Whatcha doing there

Hobgoblin, shots of hot Strongid
Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage
9 weeks awesome, hides in a slipper
Look in her eye like she might be a wizard
Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot
She got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box
And probably hoarding 40 more in the corners of Fort Knox
Swapped 20 on the spot and cop the warlock
Back at the haunt, found God in the hamper
Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther
Good around misery and golden era samplers
Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers
Bet, more than a pet to worship
It's an MD recommended sense of purpose
Here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria
Soon to be hailed, the greatest of all warriors

Why'd you eat that leaf (Yo, yo, yo)

Homie don't fetch, only woke to stretch
Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish
Skittish in the company of stranger danger
Otherwise, chase draw strings, tails and lasers
In a steel cage match with a maze of cables
Brazen, game-face based on Azazel
Oversized ears up, puke in the Meow Mix
Shred a pair of earbuds, remedy his cowlick
: Thanks Kirbs, looking like a milli
Keep an old man sharp, keep a cold Chantilly
Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment
Never lands on her feet though, I think she's broken
Mouser in training, nap on the toaster
Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker
15 years taking prescriptions
Now a shrink like, "I dunno, maybe get a kitten"

My first name is a random set of numbers and letters
And other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever
My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole to a susurrus
It couldn't just be "John Doe" or "Bingo"
My address, a made-up language written out in living glyphs
Lifted from demonic literature and religious text
Telephone, uncovered by purveyors of the ouija
When checked against the CBGB women's room graffiti
My social, a sudoku; my age is obscure
My in-case-of-emergency is in the daisies, chasing birds
Employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores
And people who open doors for the people who open doors
My medical history is a course at SUNY Buffalo
Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow
Nervous in the service, still; I'm burger meat and purple pills
—"Here." —"Thank you. We'll call your name." —"Sure, you will."

Skipped lunch
I'm shrunk

You pack up all your manias, you're sitting in the waiting room
You're dreaming of arcadia, you're feeling like a baby tooth
Awaiting panacea, channeling your inner Beowulf
In purgatory, just before you pay up to filet yourself and others
In the name of help, coal on a conveyor belt
Into ego death alone, no telephone from Gabriel
I'm half a human, combin' over Home and Garden, stoned
Gold chains over turtleneck, cigars over cologne
A thousand shitty paintings wrapped around a wounded animal
Woo him with the Schubert, he's a future human cannonball
Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu
I'm climbing up the stucco, let's get to the seppuku—uh-oh
That pretty penny turned the prickly into Benji
If you save up all your winnings, then you get to count your blessings
I finally crunched the budget up and punched the button
She called my name out and pushed me into an oven

She says, "I'm not your enemy."
I said, "That sounds like something that my enemy would say."
Instead of playing off the chemistry
She said, "You're being difficult." I said, "I'm being guarded
You're a quarter-mil' in debt; I get more guidance from my barber
Look—I'm not good at this; I grew up in a noogie-fest
You built your walls up high or said goodbye to all your Cooky-Puss
Here's one: Every time my telephone buzzes
I see images of hooded riders setting fire to hundreds."
She said, "When you start getting all expressive and symbolic
It's impossible to actualize an honest diagnostic."
I said, "When you start getting all exact and algebraic
I'm reminded it's a racket, not a rehabilitation."
Okay, agree to disagree as grown-ups from opposing clans
Honoring the push and pull, I should've called the Scholomance
Oh well, preservation is a doozy

Tech support, feral army
In a cave on a failed bit of terraforming
Four corners of paranormal
Get shorn for a thermos and pair of thermals
In the warehouse air where his dairy curdles
St. Vincent de Paul trying to square the circle
Circle the source of his power
Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale
Cherry pick blue in the pale
It's a blue-nose chewin' his tail, losing his coat
Schmoozing a high and a head-rush
Hack up bile over H1N1, and then some
One eye on the breadcrumbs
Other eye on the Drencrom
Other other eye on the income
Good knife and a grin
Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms
Peg leg, smells like Medellin
Wake in the night, make a pipe out of anything
Take 5, take a dive in the cellophane
Turn 5 into 5 6 7 8
Back out, black out somewhere fancy
Shaped like the backseat of Aesop's Camry, dude...
Seat full of chips and sandwich meat from the crypt
In the end if you give an address in a river of piss
Don't question the mystery fish
Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits
Close your eyes, lick your lips
I'm at the cafe ordering a cup of fresh
Sara gave me 2, I gave one to Rex
He said, "Fools ain't shit plus fuck the pigs
They could never understand what Sumner is"

Try soft wheels, sourdough and heroin
Eat with the chimera, fly with the seraphim

Who hold Kools like an orb in a dragon's claw
In terry cloth robes outside detox surly
Curse at a beat cop, doctor a Slurpee
Adopt no Xerxes, fear no moon man
Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants
Oooh, never could avoid himself
For long enough to contain or employ as help
And now he look both ways at the asteroid belt
Buzzed, gross and wholly unloved
Still hear an ex in his head yelling, "kiss the ring"
From a fortune to Fisher King
Or from assisted care, blisters in his hair
New day, new diary of disrepair
Soups on, 2-ton crucifix to bear
No shoes, no shirt, no fiscal year
I said hello to Marshall every morn for 6
He yelled at me every time, that's amore, bitch
It only took one tooth to crack the bug juice and chug
Turn a bum to a Sun Tzu, it's bug
Outside home is an open swim
Occultism in the throes of corrosive wind
A cold meal with the ghosts of friends
A whole host of meds, a deal on a Tone Loc cassette
I stepped over a body in the door
I pretend he asleep but it's probably more, God damn
Profound apathy, heart with a crack
I'm ships in the night, I'm darts at a map

Die already
None defy the one-man walled city
Stone made flesh, veins etched in his hands
88 stance draped in invasive plants
And rain dance unsafely, brace for the supercell
Mutiny or footage for your blooper reel, who can tell
Pours hot tar from the top of the barn
Necktie on his head, condor on his arm
Dog Star in a jar, bordering unsustainable
Mea culpa, mea culpa, maybe I should pray occult
Systematic Catholic or sigil of the Baphomet unraveling
Either way his ID show a snake and skull
Always been a private dude who couldn't keep a tally
Of which lies he told who
Dye his hair, shave, change names and his lazy drawl
Soon enough I will estrange you all
I get ghost

Ghossssst
Now the beat goes!

On Dasher
Half-dead carolers deck a hall, wreck a whole advent calendar
Brother on speakerphone lurking at the Burgerville
Bathrobe hammer toes murdering the curb appeal
Would I be returning or forsaken with the craven and
Carnivorous vegetation that take him for his Steak-umms
I dunno I gotta think about it
Truthfully I don't know which makes me a bigger coward
Either stomach all the hubris, cash in his two cents
Loose lips locked up over a chewed Eucharist
Or, maybe re-appropriate the energy
Holed up, passing the poultry to Hecate
Bullheaded burn out fled his own pedigree
And never better, never would've met your Heaven anyway
Anyway, merry merry go make soup out of bones
Just know when the room go cold
I'm a ghost

For a master of puppets, how sad are his cupboards
Non-dairy creamers, can of last supper
And a runneth over cup full of black tap water
Its a marvel of privacy over pack hunter
Raspberry jelly on his Jesus toast
And turn heather gray sweats into Easter clothes
With no immediately measurable crimewave ice-age
Christ children still skin a cat sideways
I don't pick teams or administer bans
I'm in the creek with a pick and a pan, it go
Forcibly ejected or a voluntary death scene
Tell 'em what the out-of-order blinking EMF mean

Dum-diggy, bump Biggie

The death knell generator entertain a fresh kill
Breath quelled dressed like a bloated sack of dead cells
Shedding, purple tape, purple 'hawk, ape
A single flower through the permafrost
Pick himself and learn to walk, in furry pants
War paint, circling a duralog
Boar face, devil by his side like a service dog
Schlock purist, watch the block burneth
One o'clock prophets in the parking lot at Perkins
The perfect politicians 30 clicks outside of Sturgis
Doggie bag doctors, military deserters
Who still shop surplus and can't hold jobs
I look like I'm wearing a ghillie suit when I'm not
Roll out ghost of Camu on the pegs

Tuff with two F's

Ah fuck that shit look
Can't tell if I'm a little withdrawn
Or dead dog sent to quote/unquote "live on a farm"
The coke bottles tint film noir
Tripping out the milk bar
Poison horchata cup
Milf in the Zip Car
6 arms, 6 hand-styles like ships on scrimshaw
Part Def Jam part Dischord
My wig-picker threw me out of her office
Had to cold turkey 'benzos, summer was awesome
Onion of 'bensis
Summer was awesome
Got brats on the grill
Wormwood in the cauldron
Horse hoof in the dog's mouth
Cholera in the well
Make money periodically vomiting on himself

Lift party hats out of Craft Depot
Unleaded liar blood pumped through his neck
Came down from the mountain

Don't make him raise the gate between the bettas
In a spectacle displaying the nature of strange neighbors
I paint caves 'til the rage campaign tapers
And show a new crop how he used to moonwalk
Out of breath like a 7-day old balloon dog
I still hang band posters and buy black-lights
Crib decorated like a dorm room at Brandeis
Still pretend I'm gonna build another half-pipe
Nevermind the Ford-era christening and pants size

Even his blood and body couldn't pick him out a line up

It's Aes pronounced "Why Us?!"
First learned the high art of eyeing a mark
Buying nickels for a dime at the park
I learn to rhyme in New York
I learned to breathe underwater

Vita est morte est vita
Life is death is life

Found nothing but the feathers and the skull
On the porch like a present with a bow
Denizen of black earth, gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork
Buried by a 7 year cherub in the backyard
Epitaph and all
Disciple of the cycles and sciences, of birth into fertilized hyacinth
Life into vitamins, invited up to cypresses
A testament to moxie and the miracle of lifelessness
It's tricky when you'd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient
Than navigate this mortal coil in human skin, dig?
The nuances of putrefying jelly hit the levee
When those feathers are a cancer in your bestie
And I pick a ginger gold as fed by a drunken uncle
One from a customer pumping that Sumner blood work
Memitim ascending, settling any high scores
40 meters up with the heart of a high dive horse

In which unruly roots pull you to Lucifer by your shoes I mean, it isn't perfect but don't misconstrue the purpose

Or theist, we certainly become the earth as equals, in a circle
Unique until the spirit isn't willing
While the flesh is still a staple of the labor force and whistling
It's roadkill evoking emotion his own totem don't
That's a reality you evade or grow to own
Social code broke and a hierarchy to gasp at
Black labs over wack dads on the admat
Tabby over parasite, bats at the parish
A civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms

Wrung stones unsung and alone
Known to run up in the unknown, "honey I'm home"
I push a bucket of bolts, assorted death in his wake

Not even a baby doll to change his gauze

A side effect of sliding environment to environment
Driving isn't simply when the tires spin, try again
Departures and arrivals aren't only time and mileage
Try again again, a raider break off from the phalanx

That fruition's for the viewers who need a loser to pity

Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self prior to Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And so on I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs

Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems

So you can run run run
And I'mma let you think you won
EVERYBODY!
We the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine to five day-in day-out
But we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
If I never make it home today, God bless

[A parable....What is it? Well it's a little story with a lot of truth
An earthly story with a heavenly meaning
Jesus told many parables to grown-ups and children alike
He told them simply and sincerely, in words everyone could understand
So that all might learn the lesson he was trying to teach...]

They were selfish with the helmets on the little bus
'Till brake fluid sewage crippled up the get-retorted nickel punks
Slowly cope but swore his lowly robot vole evoke
Would one day rise in sections to interrogate the Holy Ghost

Holy smokes!
Father, black suit white collar
Kiddie porn dungeon, guns, and three fingers for your daughter's
Caught belly-up, antique Nazi paraphernalia
You cannot pay your bills with holy water and Hail Mary luck 
Shucks fucker, enjoy the Alcatraz shower fun
And mommy's mad I'm cliche generation X agnostic front
It ain't the nifty fate, the 1958, before the New-New Testament-approved Altar-boy fisting rape
And "take me to your leader"
Long as he don't manipulate toddler beaver 
Call me crazy, but I bet that wasn't God's demeanor
Sodom-meter peaking 
But Long Island was Jesus every weekend
Spoon-fed to appease traditional upbringing
Of a Middle Pennsylvania shit-hole where elders movement
Stressed the stellar therapeutic Bible cycle (How?)
One church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much MORE
So the two moved to New York, made babies raised on what they'd SAW
Christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy
But immaculate conception came second to playful goodies
Like laser-tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags
And manger staff as long as Santa ate the cookies 
Grandma was a saint, while he'd paint with snakes and bullies
Said If only you'd memorized your prayers like you did your Kool Gs!
By the time I was old enough to know what religion was
I was Catholicism-numb and truly didn't give a 
'94: Moved out the crib and ain't seen a steeple since
What Knievel-evil seeps in a Christian leader's pitch
'Till priests' laps slapped with parental advisory warnings
I'll be auditioning Gods in my office on Monday morning

Uh oh! And yet another pill slipped
Down the hatch and pass 'em through the kill-switch

I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused

[This story reminds us of the one Jesus told about people who were kind and
Helpful to others. He said that one day the king would say to these people:
'Come. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you. For when I was hungry you gave me food. When I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.'
But the people asked, when Lord did we see you hungry and feed you?
Or sick or in prison and come to you? and the king answered:
'In as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren
You have done it unto me.']

Just a little bruise in the back of the pews
Acting amused with a mask and them Vatican blues
For in the eyes of the organization I was raised in
Aes' is just another sinning brick in Hell's basement
Cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists
For what? Drugs and fucking, It's part of growing up
Like cuffs over dumb shits is better than the schools
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Just a lit fuse in the back of the pews
Watching a thousand flavors of the same God feud
I figure ultimate-peace is the common theme
So its a no-brainer "peace" when the blood hit the screen
Got a basic good and evil sensibility born
Good neighbor know a halo wouldn't fit over horns
I'm more science than faith, I'm more karma than bread and booze
I'm not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused
Not an asshole I'm just a little confused

While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty-second flash visual
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split ridiculous
Fathom the splicing of first-generation fuck-up
With trickle-down anti-hero smack (Kraken!)
I pace my game for zero hour completion cretin, splash
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American Nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym
Now it's honor, and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teeming resonance
I promise, tempest-tossed breed with a bleeding conscience
See, the creed accents responsive but my sports divorced the wattage
And I'm sleeping now — wow! —yeah, the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing!)
Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
So I triple knot 'em and forgot 'em
His origami dream is beautiful
But man, those wings will never leave the ground
Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down

Each get a turn, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace

Teach 'em how to curse at police
And flee from the church, I'm the king of world peace

Bub, my dice got so many sides
In no time, you could throw 'em 'til you owe me your life
Throw forever, never once see the same roll twice
It's no joke, I don't know the snake oil price
I'm a strange force hailing from the wholly unknown
I tell a Category 5 he need to go to his room
I probably hang from a helicopter more than I need
Although, I guess it tells you what I thought of the scene
I meant to tell you when you talk I feel lost at sea
I feel like you're embalming me
Come and get a sense of the bubble
Couch on the left, but the rest is a puzzle, yeah

Staring down certain defeat
Reach for dessert, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace

Barring any personal beefs
And weeks I'm a jerk, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace

I like bones and old cassette tapes
I skip stones that go for ten days
I rid stones of the most stuck swords
"Go Back" signage over the front door
Robot dogs patrol the whole grounds
Crater in the lawn where last troll cowered
Not in the race to pass go
I'm a lone photon escaping a black hole
Truth told, never had an eye on the crown
I just jump through the glass every time I go out
Here to offer an experience your media can't
If you down to get your deep seats deprogrammed
I mean, the dude may sleep in a van
But, like, the food chain eat from his hand
I'm a backstreet butcher, bullshit wizard
Even in the summer, I'm a wolf in the winter, ayy

Creep in, burn the machine
Leave in a blur, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace
W— W— W— W— World peace
Might go berserk in the street
Cheap fireworks, I'm the king of world peace

This is not good

Bat shit, I'm bat shit, my ships crash, my zag zig
I'm all whiplash in that black tint, black ash on my flag pin
I go zip zap and y'all back spin, y'all spacecrafts call mayday
I like tailspins when they back lit and cats scrambling for that safe space
He plays defense around dead zones, next up to cold explode
Rest up, I go death punch, it rains F'd up UFOs
I throw episodes in all star maps that get veterans to bring barf bags
It bring hellfire and little party hats for those parting ways with they tarmac
Blast off and get waxed off, these saboteurs are like pack dogs
I might shoo 'em off and they boomerang, line 'em up and illuminate
It goes ooh and ah and you too late, we got a failure to communicate
In my rearview's a little planet Earth and my calendar is straight doomsdays
Fuel up and I steamroll, you better moonwalk when that screen scroll
I feed castaways to these gamma rays and my handshake is all sleeper hold
Ease in and get heave-hoed with no easy mode and no foul play
Bounty hunters get found out, power up or get outpaced

Ease awake at 3 AM
He found freedom in the mayhem, amen, amen
Give me a lost world to locate
Get ghost with folk who don't obey, okay, okay (You're almost out of time)

Warfare, I don't war fair, I like rocket fuel in my morning air
I like red buttons under iron fists and my stunt doubles like, "I quit"
The kid three-sixty all side-eye and pluck wild geese from that twilight
I go hyperspeed and can't drive for shit, I just bob and weave when y'all skydive
Lights blink and my screens glitch, if I lose it all, I ain't need the shit
I call "Bombs away", it turn mobs away, you're all, "Die alone," I'm all, "Not today"
We go eye for eye around pale moons, fighter pilots find Jesus
I don't tread soft with that special sauce, see you was better off in some mail room
Dumb luck and no late pass, I get gussied up and I gate crash
I'm playing laser tag in plain stupid odds, tag my name on they fuselage
Outlier in the main event, I keep downsizing y'all's data set
Infiltrators get checkmate, it's maybe best to just play dead

Calling Gamma Ray
This is Major Cigar
Do you read me, Gamma Ray?
Gamma Ray, damn it, come in!
Gamma Ray, please respond!
Welp, his brains are fried
Pack it up, mission's over

Do you read me? Do you read me? Do I need to reach through the TV?
Do I need to reach through the ouija? Houston, I may have gone too Houdini
I'm too uneasy, I'm out of phase and I'm orange Tang and I'm powdered eggs
And my radio has been down for days, I just stand around and sound out the phrase
It go, "Do you read me?" Shook up shoe to beanie, y'all look for the moon graffiti
Deep end of some hellhole, come detect this tempo
I been feeding back in these headphones, beating back a profound fear
Farewell to my bread crumbs, is anybody even out there?
I'm like out there, in that true 3D, that new ether, that "Do you read me?"
You don't read me, I'm barely a thing, staring off, I'm too scared to blink
I might shrink some and I shrink more, shrink past this pink dwarf
No sign of my pole star, although up here, it don't mean north
Deep space in no G-force, I more tumble out to some death bell
Some bleep bleep, robot voice, some red lights, some send help
Street meat for some E.T. to come deep fry in old frites grease
And re-home, reach out, reap what he sow
Jesus, do you read me? We don't (We don't)

And I play drums on the wheel
Whether feeling out of touch or outgunned in the field
Drums on the wheel

Bomb sites and blackouts and fog lights in gas clouds
Jockey through vacuums, none of our flaps down
It's shocking, shot off as one small part of some squadron
That ain't once chosen to abort shit, now we've honed in on our problem
Nonstop until he stop and see what kinda quadrant he got lost in
Do you read me? That option when y'alls options are exhausted
I been dropped off in this mosh pit instead of locked in to one orbit
Knock knock, call back or this cockpit is my coffin
Boss levels I'm doomed to repeat, new dance I call it "Do you read me?"
It evolve as a beyond the yonder mantra, once none pinging my transponder
Once what macabre y'all planned to conjure, been handed back to y'all unresponsive
Ten hut and I'm in sync, phone home, it just ring and ring
Asteroids that leave marks and black holes that eat stars
Green cheese and GPS bedecked with detours
Fuel gauge around E Street and my beacons are all blinked out
I might slink up in that junk heap you can't read and or pin down (Pin down)
Gamma Ray, come in!

And I play drums on the wheel

I'm what, what, what, what from the guillotine
A little flea and tick, a little fever dream
A little plead the fifth
Roadkill, I'm off leash
I don't heel and I'm hung from an unkind mobile
It turn one misstep into bonemeal
Look, daybreak, I'm lights out
My kind sleeps upside down
It's sci-fi, red tide, my hi and bye make record time
I go three, two, one, desensitize
No lie, tell death he could get in line
K, hellspawn, I'm no joke
I eat brains, I throw bolts
I know easy prey, I seen broken oaths
I go marching in, I'm all, "Oh-ee-oh"
I know a rodeo from these pony shows
I don't stay for tea, I can't slow the code, I go
Coyote, alone and ghost
I'm in the goddamn smoke, ear, nose, and throat
Ayy, yo, fresh pot, my favorite mug
Aes Rock, my day sucked
Agent of all things deep-sixed

No fair at all, dyed hair and all
Push foot, I go mach 1, I'm all, "Woosh, woosh"
I don't pussyfoot, I make potholes, my path home is all drop zones
Flash bulbs and strobe lights, road signs with crossbones
Touché from our killjoys who know humanoids are just hit points
Ain't cop that new heat, that newspeak's all pink noise
I'm more mood piece around street food
In my PJs and my snowshoes
About dog fights in those dungeons
And lil' dust-ups in y'all's throne room
It's fun stuff, low moon and my tombstone say, "Hell no"
Hell yeah to more hail storms aboard ships on St. Elmo's

My days here have been as rewarding as they are troublesome
And often dangerous
I have been assembling my notes for some time now
My intent is to create a guide for anyone whose path
May lead them to this unwavering otherness (This unwavering otherness)
There are days I fear my work will only serve to create more confusion about what I've found
But I felt it nеcessary to stay the course in hopеs that these insights may be illuminating for some
Contained within are anecdotes, recipes, survival tips, warnings, maps, drawings, and more
All organized in an effort to promote safe travel and interdimensional awareness
While this arrangement highlights the basic chronology of my experiences
Users should skip to whatever section most directly applies to their impending scenario
As no two Spirit World experiences are the same (The same)
Accordingly, certain passages may detail specific circumstances that you will not encounter
It is still recommended you cover these sections as to increase your general understanding of what can be expected
There will be times when you will be tested in ways this guide can neither prepare you for, nor help you from
Spirit World travel is not recommended for the faint of heart or weak of stomach
Swift and unprecedented consequences will follow your decision to breach this environment (Will follow)
With that in mind, I believe the unabridged Spirit World Field Guide compiled here
To be the ultimate companion for all modern supernatural tourism
As well as those potentially seeking more permanent residency
Kindest regards, Aesop RockYou might also likeEmbed
Mash the buttons, knock knock, never yield
Phobias in motion blowing smoke into the sterile field
Wonkavator up beyond the seraphim, terra beneath the keratin
Every bit precariously jerry-rigged
His helmet is a case of Bud, he factor in the paper cuts
Corrugated cockpit, I'm not exactly Major Tom
Buzzed Aldrin, I can't count backwards
Ten, one, someone get this buzzard to the Matmos
Ten thousand hours addressing open beaks
Exiting the atmosphere with no green to chroma key
Greebles on the body, tin cans on the bumper
Slip into the freezing ether like a pea coat from his mother
How much interstellar freedom can he reasonably suffer?
More than you can feed through a shutter
I use a phony voice when I'm yelling, "Nobody's home"
I'm a liar, but I wouldn't say I'm wrong

I ain't really seen land in a minute
AWOL spaceman, wave to the Mrs
Faint transmission after nothing for the summer
I have never seen so many colors
Uh, ayy

The human heart tattoo move in a hard vacuum
Only back to pay a bill or maybe fill a cart with cat food
I'm shredded, smelling like I just stepped off a charred capsule, I did
That's not imaginary ash in his wig
That's rounding Cygnus with a souvenir from galaxy quest
I know it sound like myth and magic, but the shrapnel commits
I give a fuck about a factory scent, we mostly play to the fringe
They figure, "What's a little tape on the wings?"
A little glue, a little paint, a little staple and string
You won't believe how far the garbage when that radio ping
Behold a view or two where you could lose your voice at the moon
I hope you like your beef and veggies with the moisture removed
Dig it, the low rider, lower the gold visor
Nosedive guided by the ghost of Laika, my heavens
Slow drive, side-eye stealthy
When can we expect you?
Why would you expect me?

There was a ghost who broke it all up into tiny numbers
And dated vector graphics and New York Times puzzles
Who struggled knowing love as more than boring data entry
More reported from an orbit all his own, to say it gently
I'm reporting from an orbit all my own, to say it gently
Catch a wave in the jalopy down to burn up on re-entry
Man the laser, do you copy? Keep invaders on the business end
Autopilot zeroes in on zero wind for pissing in
Fixer-upper, she putt like a Plymouth Duster
From bucket to mothership, if you're up for a little sunburn, stat
Neighbors at the mercy of a thin wall
One side nap, one satellite pinball
Fun size asteroids pingin' off the cabin
Ping, ping, the soundtrack of shrinking into blackness
I blink through 4D, droid sitting bitch scorned
The voice of destroy and rebuild
Who rose above the partly cloudy counting on a Galaga hack
His only carry-on's a napkin of math
From packed in a menagerie to cheese and crackers at the apogee
Add a little finding God and trying not to atrophy, um
I know you're whispering about me at the corner store
"We've seen the glowing light from under his apartment door"

Huh? Who's there?
Dog at the front door barking at the air
Wind all "woosh" in the trees
Then, "chk-chk-chk-chk," feet on leaves
Uh, it's probably a cat
Might be a guy with an axe
Might be a trap, shit, it's probably a trap
Might be a possum in the trash
It's probably a trap
"Ayy, keep it moving," God, I sound stupid
Good chance I'm not even talking to a human
Then again it's probably a trap, somebody had to set it
Depending on the type, maybe several
Yeah, that's it, it's probably several, several come together
To make what would've taken one forever
I'm thinking it's a pretty damn sophisticated trap
Utilizing some technology I didn't know we had
Hmm, maybe I am entirely tripping
It might've been the neighbor's kid, but I have my suspicions
I wish it were as simple as a critter, but it isn't
I feel that it's important we consider all dimensions
Like, oh, I don't know, maybe it's a trap
I step onto the lawn, y'all jump out with the bag
I wake up in some alley on a wholly other plane
Can't remember who I am or how to get back to the base
I realize you people think that I am off the deep end
I'll say that it's a lovely night regardless of the BS
It is, a perfect snow is freckling the path
It's almost like the atmosphere is begging for a trap
The mutt goes quiet, one last sniff, lopes inside
Fine, it might've been a baby squirrel who tumbled from the nest

I drag in the cat that drag in the conversation piece
Yahweh-forsaken elite, hemlock in the pot every day of the week, I'm a lot
Reach in, even the odds or evolve into mystery meat for the broth, who's еatin'?
Scream for his mom all evening, moxiе a seasonal fog
Palmful of grease, skied through "Keep Out" signage
Weed in his sock, beacon of snot
Knee-deep evil to plot through a fever, maid threw his Rod of Asclepius out
Spring and bell exploding through my Polartec
Got a soul and vessel, don't coalesce
Got a nosy compulsion to overstep
I write 8-bit maps for the so depressed
From the croc in the moat to the gold in the chest
Notice I don't program any actual way to progress
To convey an effect
Hot Vinyasa to bated breath
That fray, that plague, that bayonet
That hate, that face of death
That all-in together, I'm afraid that train has left
I ain't wade through bullshit or baby step
Pop off into flesh, no beta test
I bump Raising Hell, I make raisin bread
Raised on wolf's milk and Eraserhead
I'm all good
Quietly hacking away at a hideous riff on the formula
What is the work if it isn't a ticket to slip into vivid euphoria?

The tiptoe tailed by a trail of craters

If the police sketches a hand from the grave, unholy

I'm sorry if you know me as both

I give free hugs in a plague mask
I don't trust none of y'all's love to be more than a cheap toy gun with a bang flag
Ayy, sultan of simple fare
No lie, roll by, we can lick the air
It's an appeasement gesture, not a rib tip rare
But the bistro don't split silver hairs
I made peace with a lot, but a lot of it sits
Still, genuine props on the bottomless pit
Backseat drive with a lazy drawl
I don't aim to please, I don't aim at all, I'm okay
Actively seeking to underdevelop his sentimentality
Why am I here if it isn't effectively cutting the hellions out of me, huh?

Keep it classy
Key to Pizza Alley
Weaving traffic in a overheating taxi
In Lima
Tickets to liberate the center, pitch surrender

Fugee off the ant trail
Inca trail mailman

Dear friends
Send help yesterday
Yours true, condor, puma, serpiente
Talk rap albums over alpaca medallions
With metalheads who traffic magic flowers from the mountains
To the houses of the holy
A token of that sacred valley balance
So you don't expel omega fatty acids
The strays in the plaza look happier than my neighbors
They answer to Paddington Bear in waders
It's amazers
What ship, what shore?
I grew up writing riddles under bridges in New York
Now I travel like a highwayman who whispers to his horse
Sharing stories out of winter, trying to trigger something pure
From "Dying on the vine," to, "It's alive and indivisible"
To, "How'd I get this far without a bindle full of crystal skulls?"
Cozy local woven goods
Beaded shit for people you have never met or spoken to
But know they'll need to hold Peru

Bouncing softly off the navy blue
April showers, paper moon
Run the light and beat the drum
And smoke the dope and raid the tomb

Rubber boots and tumbo juice and tarantula toupee
Canopy going H.A.M. over camp in a feuding biome
Os Mutantes row-row-rowing the wrong way into the diode
Fry the banana, heart of palm ribbons
Fish from the river, sauces made of citrus
On a screen porch pimpled after dark with frogs and lizards
When high as hell, they might as well be Mothras and Godzillas
It's awesome
Peer into the spirit quest, spellbound
Three to one machete, yelling back into the hellmouth

"Electric eels killed two of my best friends"
Said the local to the gringo
Then dove in off the pirogue
In a cloud of smoky mopacho
They boat in from Iquitos
Mosquitos on the wall of the Amazonian ethos
Off to bounce a light off any hairy eyeball in the basin
Wild pig, owl, baby caiman
Coral snakes that drape down from the timbers
Like the six fingers of Satan
They only speak in S's, you cannot get an amen
I told my darkest secrets to a pair of fuchsia dolphins
The doozy out in Paris, the futures I had squandered
They whispered something to me I will bear unto my coffin
What's apparent via Occam is despondency as common
We traded numbers and made off into the pond scum
Humming Muddy Waters
Motherfucker, I am on one
Earth, wind, fire, and papaya
We fly with the poison arrow
We dive with the arapaima
Look
The river boils when it sees me
The river boils when it sees me
The river boils when it sees me

And when embracing the horizon, it pours on us a black day which is sadder than any night4Embed
Carry his own water as nary a known other
Read a palm when I parry apparently no sucker
Man slash island, casually hammers iron
Falcons that come to daddy, fabulous cash and prizes
I'm back of the theater, feature feeding rapid eyes in crisis
Out of sight is both his fancy and a random act of kindness for ya
Ride the wild aurora, future bright as fried Gomorrah
Present tense an SOS in tidal water, final offer, sold
I been shaking off a death rattle
As a window-bound bat from a collapsed red flannel at night
Flight path managing a back and forth
That draws a heart and dagger if you track it all with tack and yarn
Six foot a million, nothing off the rack fit him
I dress like fingers of light through black nimbus
Ruined last Christmas, probably ruin this Christmas
You can follow it from wing to cataclysm, listen
He carry his own water as nary a known other
Burn sage in the alley with various ghostbusters
Sea of disembodied bones knocking on your rods and cones
Some resort to scuba gear, some return to hobbit holes
Me, I done a lot of both, riding out and running scared
I'm everything from, "He's a pest," to, "He's been dead for twenty years"
He's been shredding perfect curbs and golden light with total scum
Pigeons bring him donuts, I'm the motherfucking chosen one
And every time you liars talk, fish and birds start dying off
Roses turn to solid ice, quiet eyes to fireballs, um
I started spilling all my problems to the final boss
He shed a tear and let me by him like, "What's mine is yours"
Broke him off a little weed
Bid him well, off to see a system into smithereens
Sniffing out some livers he could lose in a broth
It's when he go and pull the hood from the hawk
You look lost
He carry his own water as nary a known other
Go halves on the carrion, carry-on bolt cutters
Not a towel boy or cow to the slaughter
I leave an awkward conversation like a cow to the saucer
Inspire a thousand Our Fathers, people start calling their priests
"We've never seen a man so vehemently drawn to the beast"
"I heard he plays a pipe organ and changes form when he feeds"
I've never played a pipe organ, the rest my lawyer concedes, okay

My streak allegiant
My body failing
I'm east of Eden, not holiday
And these feet a realized sovereign nation
Each free to Watusi and do so duly
At night whеn the zoo get toothy
A once and futurе goon, own the exit row
Burn the leeches off, throw the second stone
Note the pest control, claw the peepers out
Hold the telephone, shit
Here go thirteen loops in a rope
For the truth, what it do, what it don't

Hello as in what have you become?
I cannot have been the only one
I cannot have been the only one
Figured y'all would never pony up
Slither off into the going gone
I cannot have been the only one
I cannot have been the only one

Born of an elusive baboon troop
Horseflies that backstroke the boot soup
Show up like an eyeball in a moon roof
One false move, dude, you're a food group
Old friends turn flames to the hayride
I was kind of unimpressed with the AI
Get gutsy or crushed in the canines
Bring a steak knife, bring a trail guide
Breaking out of that boarded house
Faking normal has worn me down
Hit the road, an old misanthrope
Alone, tip me over and pour me out
Cozy up to that pressure cooker
My heart's a bottle, my head's a butcher
My blood a mix of both milk and sugar
I push the pencil, no pencil-pusher
Kid been had toxic folk in a sphere
Kept it afloat, I was frozen in fear
In the closure, the ghost just won't disappear
It make the whole globe a road to nowhere
Joke's on you, I'm going nowhere
Still, 5-0 is, "Woah there," oh dear
Stoney bologna, drum the undo
Two score plus, never been a stuffed suit
At the coliseum grown numb
Hello as in what have you become?
I cannot have been the only one
I cannot have been the only one
Figured y'all would never pony up
Slither off into the going gone
I cannot have been the only one
I cannot have been the only one
Know the fee, the fi, the fo, the fum
Notice a bouquet of bone and blood
I cannot have been the only one
I cannot have been the only one
Over the crowd it was, "Yo, what's up?"
Under his breath it was, "Holy fuck"
I cannot have been the only one
I cannot have been the only one

Meanwhile back at the brackish
Half-man, patch-in, splash with the hapless
Tag every hack in the badlands
Spoon-gagged, amass the too trashy
Ragtag, rad to the last Boo Radley
Bad back and limbs that don't act right
Still flap with the bats in the black light
Architect of hard luck, turn love to a crash site
After lunch, before naptime
Z-Z-Z-Z, jaws on floors
A two-bit tour de force, I'm all yours
Rabid and raised to rig the game booth
I lick the plate clean, I lick the blade too, look
Ten beepers, even the freak elite
Fall back when the creature leap
His U.F.O. throw shade sea to sea
Jeez Louise, an omen to read and weep
The road been brain for the hunt, nose for the bone broth
Cold shoulder programmed to stonewall
Old dog, I'm known to cold know all
Don't wait 'til the whole shit snowball
One peek at the code in the moleskin
Might just render you part of the potion, woah
Never you mind the moth eggs
I'm warm and the TV is on alwaysEmbed
Ayy
I could give a fuck if there's mold on my daily bread
I'm a foe to the fainting goat, I'm at home on the razor's edge
Over the garden wall when your Rover was playing dead
Arm-in-arm with a melancholia, roses and baby's breath
Slow to reveal a signal from deep in the tub of tiger balm
Lighter lit, giant slalom circumvent the psychopomp
Womp womp, circle to the watering hole
Something secluded where the spoon stand up in the joe
Pursue a puff of smoke who never hum or trumpet his post
From unassuming to the poltergeist of multiple homes
Ultimate weapon, slow the pulse to a crawl
"Sir, we had thought he was toast"
That's when the elbow drop from off of the ropes
Family approach him like he sat up in his coffin and spoke
We only talk in awkward hello after awkward hello
Most of my visitors request that I be tied to a chair
I wear the skin of my detractors, maybe try not to stare
Yeah

Every time I look up from the paper
I see animals exhibiting irregular behavior
Even though I know that it's a warning
I am back on my old shit again like any other morning
Every time I peek out from the corner
Birds are flying belly-side-up, fish are walking out the water
Even though it seem legit
I'm right here til the season dip

To cowering in corners, "Mother, make us some warm milk"
From 'bout it to the mayor of Snoresville in a jiffy
The final form's a portrait of a squirrel stuck in a chimney
I buy a second seat for my extraordinary piss and moan
Feet up while the fleet assemble, keep the devil in the hole
With several yelling, "Sparta," you were yelling, "Marsha, Marsha, Marsha"
Only one'll read the chapter after larva, it's a good one
I'm haunted by Atlantic water bade adieu
Balancing a billion rocks to levitate adjacent to
Escapist at the undisclosed, aloof and newly mummified
You're upsetting the customers, you should see the other guy
Wait

How many vermin get to scurry up the piggy back
And burrow in before it lose the personhood to sticky trap?
Clown car of clingers, I shiver off with the water dogs
Invoking tippy toes along the wall and diving somersaults
That sneak him out the supper club, and muddy up the coveralls
I leave y'all to the scuttlebutt
We get our water from the source directly
Zoltar, predisposed to go dark
Ghost ride, all roll-bar, no lodestar, ayy
Comeuppance like a fire licking at your shoes
When all you want is happy feet in hammocks under azure blue
Have you any marrow past the ballyhoo or no, sir?
No, it's mostly snotty noses pressed to empty zoo enclosures going
"This is stupid, I'm tired, I want a pretzel"
The guppies are getting grumpy, there's nothing like nothing special
I know you were expecting just a Jekyll
The others are in there also, his company doesn't end well

What-what, w-what's that?

I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm a slow burn, crawl around the road work
Something from the other side clawing at the known world
Cough up all your cookies with the autumn air incarnate
He all-city by the time your eyes adjusted to the darkness
In parts uncharted, always find the corners cozy
You can send your fastest riders, I return the horses lonely
Controller, the locals only note the lucky charms and army jacket
When your addy's in the heart of thar be dragons, I know
No solicitors, waves away his visitors
From ten minutes in front of a tainted energy signature
Still bullseyeing womp rats from the scenic route
Sugar in his coffee like a séance in the TV room
The cheek swab came back half-amazing
Half of what he make end up on his lab apron
If quieter than most, I'm mostly mastering the science of
Keeping one's composure while the limbic system's lighting up

Some try to combat any kind of odd force tryna make contact, nah

Stuck around for more than just a parlor trick or flickering fluorescents
Had a couple still to visit with a million pressing questions
Like, where you the night of?
What are you traversing Earth in spite of?
How are you adjusting to the triumph?
I'm asking for a friend who caught a loss and never surfaced
Simply curled up in his cubby, shutting down the central nervous
Look, float up into urgent care, a checkerboard of blurry squares
Flowers in the lobby shrivel back into the earthenware
Humans in the lobby holding crosses up
I understand the caution but
Some of you just wanna see the coffin jump
Until the coffin jump, then it's what I call a punk
Didn't even get to where he coughing blood and talk in tongues
Not to mention, once you hassle the hoard
It doesn't matter how much furniture you stack at the door, yeah

Hand-drawn map cross over, cross back
Calling from the flight deck, I collect dog tags
Tall grass, asphalt, or salt flat
It's all jazz like an alphabet to Saul Bass
Bratty to the basic anatomy of a death stare
Passing through the old Manhattan, ectoplasm everywhere
Pack a second teddy bear, I'm headed for the panic
Take a second for some bacon, take his head off when in transit
I don't coexist, I don't exist
Even J.C. miss him with the loaves and fish
You feel dementia getting closer like the devil getting over
Now his antennas are roaming for radio terra nova
Going, "Ksht, ksht, sir, I think we've got a signal
It's fuzzy, but they're playing one that wasn't from the hymnal"
I'm a faint scent of sulfur, I'm the source of the ooze

I'm a glutton where the food still shimmy and shake
Not a fingerprint to pin him to a physical plane
Probably show up as an isolated pocket of cold
Got a way of making tilapia hop in the boat
I was fending off a lizard on the dock of the lake
In Siem Reap, smoking something I forgot how to say
Maybe twenty paranoia, eighty plotted against
Palm reader calling in his archaeologist friend
It's been a long and bitter breakup with the science of sleep
I'm through the lobby on my stomach with a knife in my teeth
Brave winter, rain slicker over mutinous code
Finally free of all you fuckers I should pull through a phone
I could transform later when the gradient fade
There's a paranormal energy awake and engaged
There's a Kawasaki out behind a barn in Angkor
Money said if you could start it, it's yours

Forecast warm, leftover chicken for the dogs
I've been jumping over fences in a hundred different forms
Next week warm, message at the tone
I've been sketching on the roof or getting sketchy in the strobe
Warm, six legs circling a drain

When the motor finally folded to the accident prone
Had to flag another captain, phantasm in tow
I've been ignoring any semblance of relatable Earth
I got a homie from the region who could name every bird
And tell you what it is to wake up with a tank in the yard
Type of shit to make you question what your days even are
There's a holy waterfall where you could rinse and repeat
Find religion while the minnows eat the skin off your feet
If you wake me on a January morning at four
Don't get excited when I bark at the door

Y'all keep not being shit, all I do is chomp at the bit
Caltrop in his foot, still hop to the bridge
All rah, rah, a pox on your kin
Pass through the prism, maintain position
Knock over everything, walk away whistling
False name, I work at a fake business
Daybreak 'til I break up into trained pigeons
And I came from the cave paint, chase painkillers
Tailed by an arcane shape in the scribble
I stake out snakes that forsake the sigil
Wait 'em out, show 'em how the wavelength ripple
I'm afraid they don't wanna see a wound-up truant
Get to walk down a street to the sound of doves cooing
Doves like, "I love what you doing, even when it's drugs at the ruin"
Money, I was plucked from the fire, jumped back in the fire
It's fucked, you're free to hire another pathfinder
Skull and bones humming the tones that don't bode well

Flies buzz around the sink
Lunch on crumbs, fuck y'all think
Everything was fine, not a single peep
It happened overnight, must've been the açaí
Some uninvited guests, some unappealing sludge
A couple hundred eggs, a day to yield bugs
I make a few traps, bleach in the drain
You should see the trash, it feels like a plague
Clean the whole crib, bottles at the curb
Even empty out the fridge, that's gotta be a first
Still can't win, two on the tiles
Three by the spout, me in denial
I'm clapping at the air, I'm cornered by the plates
I'm brought unto my knees, I'm forfeiting the space
I'm clawing at the walls, swarm ordering me ate
It's death from above, nobody saying graceYou might also like2Embed

Let me clear my throat (Let me clear my throat)
Pocketful of rocket fuel and pyramid stones
Invoke a spirit from the parallel
Appearing as unwelcome news
That drag you to the shadow realm
And back for show and tell at school
Promising a future more bedraggled than bedazzled
When, "It isn't you, it's me," began the dagger to the scabbard
Free snake tats, plays on train tracks
Dorm like a door to Hell, the doorbell plays Taps
Born inside a ring of baffled demonologists
A casualty of otherness, what the fuck's an olive branch?
Rats as big as cattle sent to Babylon convulsing
The home sweet home that sees you as bag of hostile protein
While I do believe that you believe you're adding to the magic of the motif
Homie, all I hear is, "Dad, I want a pony"
Fuck the police, I'm floating out with the Camazotz
Property of nada, runs on Trompe le Monde and Otter Pops
Roger that, cobblestone beyond the common polygraph
His middle fingers wear little safari hats
Chainsaw shave in the house of a thousand tonics
They're magic if you need a cure for lack of sour vomit

Ping in the rubble, located burning his bacon
Ravens deliver him trinketry in eternal damnation
I make disturbing the stasis a game to beat when the mania boils
Even the days when the pavement's keeping his platelets employed
Stole an ox on occasion
I go through wands too quickly to name 'em
Okay I'll name one, it's the rod of fuck the nonsense
A basic wave and nod'll turn bravado into fondant
We slalom from beyond the wildly oscillating compass
Whether you connect the dots or not is truly not my problem
Familiar with the color of permanent cloud cover
Though I've heard there might be others, I'll buy it when it buffers
Until then a dry and lifeless pile of, "Whys?" and, "Ay carambas"
In a bubble watching dumpster fires multiply in numbers
I know that fear and love and death and pride and romance hold you by your Chukkas
Though it's unclear what some closure might encompass
A bid to visit symmetry from civil war and swim ashore
Sob story same as yours, but a little more, ha
I'm in the alley pacing, I'm skirting curtain call
I make my hospital corners in a circle of salt
That's a unique prayer
Pretty nervous on the low

Bamboo shoots, Buddhas and removed shoes
Pugilism brewing over whose tuk-tuk's whose
Moving through the super-moon with goonies off a distant block
And fugitives from Dusit Zoo in pleasant moods until they're not
Present mood a startling departure from the temple rules
Part of it's the temperature, part of it's the tentacles
AQI alarming, surgical masks marching
The durian got him gagging, the traffic is anarchy, um
Siam spy cam, try him in fire
I'm marigolds and Muay Thai into the eye of the tiger
I almost died on a scooter, I almost died on a boat
I figure fuck it, baby, come as you are and die as you go
North bound, Lopburi, where it's humans: zero, monkeys: one
Humans fear the monkeys won, get your mirrored sunnies, run
Later watched a billion bats exploding out a mountain cave
Climbed a couple hundred feet to stare into the mouth and change
Descended a little different, every atom individually cleansed and repositioned
That's one unconventional exorcism for the kiddo
Hearts on his pillow, bars on the window

Locals see a space garbage that fell from the interstellar
Trying to blend in with the smell of peppers, sweat and citronella - ella

Corpse pose, staring at the moon

Crops wither, docks splinter into popsicle sticks

Vampyrella riding pillion through the eventide
Indecency that deck the halls, an eye in each Venetian blind
I'm mеat into the Venus fly, ears back and hacklеs up
Shifting with the shadow play, I show 'em how to rabbit hunt
It helps if you're particularly paranoid
Enough to know there's no such thing as an extraction point
Attaboy, I'm a sucker for stolen bases
Bathing in open ocean and shaving in Mobil stations
Away from the hocus pocus
The nauseating social codes and motives
The homies demoted to interlopers
Look, I can help you tumble through the galaxy
Somersaulting backwards into vacuous finality
Shabby chic, overnight a fireball from magic camp
Inspired by a banzai fly into Manhattan clam
No hands, pissing off the ferry, mission-ready
The flesh and blood are present while the rest is vision-questing
Plugged in, gloves off, shushing all tough talk
Nowhere to be found at the trust fall
I'm saying "fuck y'all", live and direct
I make a Judas shoot a flare up from the Isle of the Dead
I got a network in the netherworld I seldom reveal

Odd hours, I'm up with the spotted owls
Spot a coward in the commons how he spot a common mouse
At a half mile, last-minute mohawk
Eyes closed, ear to the road salt, all I hear is Mozart
Gale force winds whipping through your floppy hat

Or underneath a haunted freeway overpass, around a storm-worn flat square
Kicking wooden toys around and vandalizing random city property
A proper way to pencil-in a Saturday without cab fare
Bulldozer dozing over every brick or black top
Spin the backdrop
Metropolis or in the pretty backwoods
Bring wax, thanks bye
Black ops, all flat spots
Rat-a-tatting in forgotten back lots
Steady feel a pull to power-slide around brake lights
See him off into the fog
Figure 8-ing in the moon
Never let him know the odds
It isn't part of how I move
See him off into the foul
Celebrating in the road
Never let him know the count
It isn't part of how I goYou might also likeEmbed
Come on

Born garbage day, warden of the shawarma plate
Fork a naked eye, and trade survival tips with tardigrades
Ephemera burning where the morning look like haunted marble cake
Parkas and pajama pants, I'm part of what don't march-in-place
I'm partial to the closest roving pack of gnashing gums
Smoking out the local protein, brokering the rabbit punch
I'm broken, fuck a focus group, fuck your folk, and Toto too
The produce of a pencil-neck who never met a social cue
Eye of the archfiend, appetite for alpha dogs
Step into the party with a killing jar and shadow box
Like "Who invited acid wash?", I'm shopping for the mantelpiece
Overkill is catalogued and crammed into banana leaves
Polaroids around him like a visit from the Vantablack
Miniatures in Biggie shirts and minutes that he can't get back
It isn't just gorillas in a camera trap, it triggers
The history pack a little aftermath in every image
Look

I should paint a eye on the front door
I should tell time by the sun more
I want a flaming arrow shot into a creeping raft
I'm kidding I just want the cheapest shit you people have
It's no thing

No displayed blazonry, unmistakably mutinous
The mood is disillusionment, shit, even Cindy Lou Who quit
I'm super stupid, future looking tuna fish and suture kit
In route to mute the TV and a view without a boot to lick
Bruised at the nucleus and drooling through the bells of war
Meet the neighbors when your resume is "skeleton-with-oar"
"Ummm, that's really cool your poodle made the paper"
Let's keep it at shoes in a elevator
He's a hat and coat, floating with no discernible visage
The villains turn to their homies who mostly turn into crickets
I'm part of a larger ghosting, I go to work with the wizards
Who already voted homecoming theme as a burning village
The damn shame campaign pivot when you in the field
Thinning blood and newly surfacing disorder, spin the wheel
Feeders out to slow the roll, reaper on the protocol
People you confide in will be spotted eating rodents whole

I should hang a skull on the side door
I should drink water from the sky more
I want a thousand lanterns drifting on a summers wind
I'm only joking, y'all can feed me to the fucking pigs
It's no thing

Marshmallows over magma from the mantle has been cancelled
How snappy can you adequately scaffold?
Happy canvassing the neighborhoods I'll never take advantage of his patron
As a patient they are plays to be a phantom of
Nan under the bandages, examine 'til he vanishes
I don't feel a social pull to show the wolves where grandma lives
I find deliverance from evil either in a sedentary binge
Or spring interning with the cemetery winds
No stacked sash or accolades from authority
The backstory gets all back-into-a-corner-y
Abuses in the feeding tube, that circle back to eat at you
Bacteria that tip the hat, adversity that gleam the cube
It's tit for tat with slippery aristocrats who pity cops
And brilliant rats who find the grit to slip out of the Skinner box
The moat's supposed to keep the rivals out
The calls are coming from inside the house
I should nail boards to the back door
I should feed squirrels from my hand more
I want to meet the maker in a proper suit and shoes
I'm lying, let 'em find the body with the loot removed
It's no thing1Embed
I never don't float with the four winds
Sweat cold, piss warm, make war films
No doors on the forcefield, radio ahead
I log any palpitation of the web
Whether aphid or angel of death
Entertainment or threat
By the end, you're a savory crepe
Models that mar every orbit and corner, it's horrid
There's more exhibition than voyeur, oh boy
Cold dawn mist incarnate
Every day, I wake up in a different carcass
If I climb out quiet I'm myth before tea
I see no need to initial the tree
I seem to have run out of skin on my teeth
I look like I feel like a fish in a beak
I look like a dick in my picture ID
But also the pic isn't me, huh

Blood rain, I'm a phase of the forecast
Storm through space like a blade through stored fat
Graze over the gate in the gore-fest
Ain't really play to the neighborly format
Great, baited adventuring out of his norm is a lesson in mapping the doors
Anything more in the lap of the gods
Anything less an imbalance ignored
Seems like even the ragtag grab bag
Raise eyebrows when your rat pack quack quack
Spitfires that kiss the pitch dark

He spins a grim yarn

The one with the red cross sprayed on the door and a mountain of mail on the porch
The one with the pit trap cloaked in the grass and a thick black smoke from the cracks
The one with the werewolf chained to a tree and a circle of flames at your feet
The one with the ominous regional lore
Why? Which one's yours?
Ignore that, don't care
Toast the march of uncombed hair
It came from beyond the red coals and road flares
XO, bring his own moat to the social
I'm so stand offish, nobody's host cell
Don't, just, just, just, just don't
Pulled to the flames while pushed to the rope

Night Light, sucka!!!

Put one up for shackle me not clean logic procreation
I did invent the wheel, in a previous generation
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I locate modern halos and pass 'em out to the cavemen
Y'all catch a 30-second flash frame
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split fantastic!
Fathom the splicing of major-league low-life
With anti-hero earthworm mentality – Godzilla!
I pace my game for zero-hour completion
See, a cretin's still a cretin, even speakin' altered moniker
American nightmare lost in the monitor
I'll hold the door open, so you can stagger through
Then send berserker-bred Jukies in after you
It's Gutter, and I spell it with the 'G' I stole from "Get the fuck up!"
Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teeming dumb luck
Still I promise: temperance towards breed still bleeding Amish
See, the freaks sucked out the wattage
While three bears invade the cottage
And I can't sleep now! Yeah, the police'll laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when you're hosted
By the ghost of Christmas past
You won't be laughing when your blow-up doll's got a headache and won't give up the ass
I'ma lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed
So I staple-gun 'em to my feet
This origami dream is beautiful: pull the tail, watch the wings flap

I'm pretty sure I got a pulse
Plus we Shimmy cross the centerfold, and our night light engulfed
Just let me keep the crumbs (Please!)
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a dead-beat tryin' to make a dollar off a bomb threat
Okay, link me to activism chain, activate wild-style Pluto orbit
Set a course, then push the button
I swallow spores born by the laws
Of a morbid glutton– Alley gospel
I can spot a duck battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle (gone)
Zig-zag and zig 'em again
Before the pig can pull a badge out for the lash out
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Like, "Houston, we have a problem: they're buffing the trains the same day the graffiti writers bomb 'em!"
Who split holiday freaks on box-cut cinema high road bellow?
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow!
I'm tryin' to meet the wizard, but a tailgating tin-man holding a oil can won't let a hermit crab break in his new shell-toes
Life's not a bitch: life is a beyotch

Or maybe you're just an asshole – maybe I'm just an asshole!
Kiss the speaker wire (*kiss*)
Sammy Swashbuckler pagan threshhold
Stomach full of diner food, wingspan cast black upon views

I got this friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah," and gave him one last look and smashed him

Go fish
Pigeon, itching for a pit to put the pig in
Scalped, bottom feeder, nose bleeder, cheap seats
To the meat eater sweeps sweet freak freaks
What up?
Grip clicker, smack the dummy box fix picture
Stickle over shit, cinema flicker in the plasma
The latch key degree was obtained in the savage years
Where he learned the binding of a wire hanger to rabbit ears
Every pixel that leaked dead over the carpet
Had to be spit-shined and hidden before the ford duster parketh
When mommy marched in, wrapped the broccoli in the napkin
For your electric paradisio after the parent crashes
And I'm high on ion jitters, call it a prime directive of the damned
Who grew to sleep easy to white noise
The humming of the machinery running towards them crawl
Social retardation larvey plugged into the wall
The little short circuit with the still born vibe
Till the villagers circled and determined "it is alive"
Shipped to Bellevue eyes fuzzy talking funny
Like "eagle one to grey squirrel whats your twenty dunny?"
I piss clumsy with electrode head pan (sorry)
Pitty the pretty internet gotta empty the bed pan
Left hand numb from the finger to the thumb (right!)
Right got tubes in it, irony is fun (yaaay!!)
At some point early when drunk on electric kisses
I'd apparently notarized forms excusing scalpel slippage (sign this)
The pain came on a makeshift main stage
And sentenced to in an inoperable eight bit frame rate
For that I made a game play, reborn torn
At the ministry of information trying to get informed
They'll duck it out and I will cease all wars
So if you babysit a Carroll Ann be fore warned
I be the ultimate (ultimate), multi polar
Mobile medicine cabinet stocked adequate
Pockets like maracas, that will shake when he stepped
Which explains the circle of rattlesnakes where he slept
Smarter then the average bear, barter parts and gadgets
With battery op enthusiast pardon the barking badgers
While you were parking daggers in kittens with snarling children
I was sharking classes with taggers for television (Click!)
Gattaca days, Attica paper scattered
Diagonal mahogany boggled the train savage
To boxed the botanically inclined child slave labor
Blades clipped the perfect petal now play later
Play never, if escaped raped treasure
That's a jewel freebie out a old geezer, no teether
Or even yesteryear scrapes fester, administer gauze
But cauterized wounds bleed if you ain't ethered the cause
King of applause (yay!) beats the garbage flood for ten(?)
Porn king of New York, alley punk perv scum
Waddle on the voyage of the voyeur
Six four sick king breezer sniff whores through brick
I am so dangerous evil and mercy heaven
Allergy to compassion he is the perfect weapon
Un- earth it and siphoned from Delorean doors swivel up
With aviator radar blip for most glorious titty fuck
Cool green over the frame under the clothes line
Whose crew choose fuel most, mine
Holy trinity, triple six, triple x, city barrack
Glutton for punishment super size me while you at it
He da:
Built hideous, silk of the milk litigant
Silly wicked finicky fidget the middle digit ish
Will he alter what he feel is illy to pick at every little smidgen of integrity
As your industry bitch? NO
Final answer, track the moniker
To the freight hot reaking of butter beans and harmonica
Dirty old man no tea cup thirst, peak up skirts
For slaps from that d-cup nurse
Cackle his old gums lewd (lewd), crass
Show the girl a trick like how he opens can food with the only tooth he has
She like THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING
They don't call him anabolic Aes for nothing, OK
Now current picture aside all anti-celebs remain aggro
Half mast the flag pole
Dead walk sturdy, but the day I greet the worms
I pull the daisies down with me as a fuck you to the norms
Generic's so unappealing and in my humble opinion
Defeats a rappers civic duty to the culture
Granted every topic has been covered but cookie cutter
Delivery of simpleton wit is the real culprit
So whether street, club, battle, conscious or other
I find that interesting style can often out weigh the subject
So when the disc changer goes from guns to space
It is not an attempt to fake credibility for the public
But fuck it it's ace rock six records of gibberish right?
He's trying too hard to be weird and different right? (riiiiight)
Or could it possibly just maybe be, his lessons
Can't be summed up in a linear set of pop culture references?
(WOW) yeah but why try, I'm so groggy
The mach nine Ballentine ain't for everybody
But I will say this to y'all that used your fifteen of fame
To mention my name, that sixteenth minute regret is fucking insane
And that's a longevity veteran peddling free medicine,(here)
Who the fouler howler (me) who the rabble rouser
What the happy hour starved the Peruvian aggy powder,(tight)
Trade up at the digital Jesus factory outlet (bout it, bout it)
Bout it bout it, fuck a fork tongue cutlery, the fuckery is famous
Never wild shook but a slang that maybe alienated a couple strangers
Held a mongoloid fanbase that is alien by nature
Robot wars, machines hit the floor
And the simians syncopated a gigantic "encore"
Alright I'm bored, five minute bag of tricks
If you hate me you can eat a bag of dicks

Unsigned hype, front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher, out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food, manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose
Can’t gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets

Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello! Here’s where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails to bootlegs of Hawkwind
Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall

Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you

Yo, I surf an axiom kicked in a center fold by ugly tenements
Oh distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby developments
Today summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate
Tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it
There is a brain in the thicket tap circle
Cupping the port to accord it
Teeter thorn storm plunges more
But conformers the pouring's half the entry
Plated pearly gates a chanted axis
With high gentry hinging our binging on public picket fencing Squirming in terms in conditions of un-satisfact destiny magnet
Where the Ebenezer to Cratchit ratio tragic
Lose sight pseudo mavericks clash at futility pageants
I post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion
A leader's deception connection
Wiper with a barn responds his friend
With an eye socket full of needles
And a will to die for nothing
And that's glory
Abide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats
And the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath
All aboard that awful train through shames patch
Where I'd trade my window seat
For one pane of replacement stain glass
See I bow to the the gods of opacity
I don't mind y'all looking in
It's just watching Sin City steam slips under my skin
And I'm about half way to nausea
Half way to contentment
2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment
Build a pen around Mastodon
Patriarch close to four peters
Woke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious
Let's soak my feet in lake infinity
With a timebomb strapped to dignity
Symmetries vivid image still can't mimic the victory
Comfort is a drug and I'm numb as fuck
Yet some prefer the hum and
Others tend to suck the life out of the crux like
And I'm a tug dummy, hug the hungry
Pull the lever, push the button
Drink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest
Target everyone
Mechanized idols inhabit malleable colonies
'Till the fire ant dropped the sweet leaf, grief
Your dreams a needle in a needle stack

Build me a home of brick and wood and everything good
With a front porch where I can jar fire flies by night
And smoke stog's till the day meets twilight

Build me a home with a green grass hill with running water
In a backyard with a sandbox and a garden of foreign flowers
Build me a home
With a basement and an attic
Where I can store remnants of the day I once slept in
Build me a home
No skull is sacred in the races
Locked in a pagan doctrine
Watching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant
Ochre and sienna war paintings stain plague community
Harking as wrapped, it's overlooking out crops
Give you one life to laugh at catalog bliss
On the least common attachment
Ten seconds of blaring silence
Pilot is flight redefine stagnant
Most emotions host an entire lesson
Congressional, less one
Stone merely for the exceptional spectacle now
Listen the pause heed tall falls the voidance of the suit dispersed
Where the straight and narrow’s a perfect circle has-beens
Fastened to the flip side via migrating clusters
That's better than colony
My own father's son is the holy ghost, suck that theology
High king for a day or peasant for a pleasant life
Blood on the easel and my eagle eyelid spots runaway pirates
Look, I despise squatters with a, oh, cry me a river
A quarter how'd you afford that dog and sour dialogue
I put my hook in the pond
I put my worm in the hook
I put my trust in the worm
That he'd bring me something to cook
I felt a tug on my line and I lugged a trash can
On my pole with a note from the worm attached that
Read, "Thanks for nothing asshole!"
Simple parables of nature making character giddy
And riddle me a similar situation mid city
Quick, put your honor on the line
Doors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda serpents and
Report on powers of devil treatment church links
I'm a fence sitter
Lips torn by both polars and their working
I can only model throttle at the dream catching
Matching a patchy holist with a sovereignty
Harbored and charged by hate breed anonymity spigot
Spitting stitches to fix the bridges and the gaps
One night I broke in
Bridges give us traps and
Tried to walk to get stogs just like hop scotch between polar caps
And I'm, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath
Making that classic mockery of every step
Oh, build me a home

I saw the wrought-iron cross inverted circlin' above my turret
Slid the spiraling banister down and hide, banished am I
My ruby glass glazed specs staple the trader of market thieves
Where vendors count the stolen citrus out their pyramids
Mirrored without a slapstick
Mavericks plugged directly to third rail surges
Piss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits
Oooh child, raised as oddity, son of a circus side-show freak
Pertinent to the slide show, the wino's leak but I won't speak
Infected projection hung thick in the air
Pungent as burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes
Pucker another 60-second lapse while 60 stars collapse the suckers
And I'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water, my god
Sweet Christ, crucify me with railroad spikes
Use my skull to bash them all in, gather sit and grin, weave
All fail the most serene communication pageant
Where sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges
I spell merit with my name stitched on my heritage
And serenade arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished grin
Buried in leagues a "'Please', Thank You', 'Pardon', 'Excuse Me'
'Your Welcome', 'May I?' ohh, I'd like to nod but no you may not

Jonesing for home alone days to sit and count my poems, I
Dig in the dirt I rig up the earth like pulley systems
Thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries
Strung along a song of spawning thorns of fury
Numb the anti-add-alarm before he recognized this worries me
Carpet-bombers spearheading fink operetta
Walk my line, now what? Now strut that little poison combine
Y'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand Sloppy leagues
And dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit fall
Lack of most lords aboard, heroes unsung heroes unbrung rewards
Yo if I flutter in a trouble clutch then I dance fancy forward
Like park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers
My wing span can and will employ full expansion
Unfolding while lamping at home with my hands panning for gold
Told them the roof was on fire, when that structure burned to ashes
All y'all saw was Aesop Rock holding an empty book of matches
Maybe I'll sit until the spilling motors clear
Maybe I'll sit and stroke my billie goat beard
And rethink the time angels appear, maybe I won't
Bundled in my humble little plummet
Numb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes me sick

You about ready? (Yeah)
Good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder
And good evening wonderful riddance and such
Maybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo
Trimming the tunnels end off end with tenants spangled 'cross
A more tangible premise
This splendors, shimmy splinters all up in day-tripper visuals
Take it easy man, fuck it I'll take it any way I can
My palms are chinrests
When I witness fury scurry past my window
Model city in a bottle plugged hostile
Its bliss kissin pollution
And a billion suckers pucker in a bind
Maybe the sunken ship is the treasure
No, but they insist it man, I'm
I'm trying to spin me dizzy, sponging up to giving dungeons functions
As opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions
Everybody drop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical
Marveling at the spite with which it curdled
Outside my tenement: coax a little warmth
From out the mugs of masons wasted
Laying bricks for days to later find they own the lot adjacent
Mark the blasphemy, elements of eloquence and savagery
Murder the gossip, fuck it, run off happily
The broken spoke cyclers choking open Doctor Zaius born fetus
In a matchbox keylessly padlocked to the hammer base

Shedded in the hell tale to motivate behind suspended leverage

Opulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a pebble toss
Sunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address
Exhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine
When trappers slack, the traps unlatch, the catch covers the tracking lines
That will make his majesty furious

And when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance
I'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence
Well I am a room with poison oak scaling the sides
Arachnids on the celing, rugged thumb tacks, bones and rusty pipes
If you can squeeze between the bars (then please!)
Enjoy my space employ my waste
Encase the hand dealt by a stolen grace

So when landsharks start circling the borders
You could just cut them off at the corners?

Pertinent to, which kayak pilot succeeded in surfin' it through

So if you need me spread your wings to spell my name
Above the mess near the other funny requests
See my all too tolerant mannerisms have hired a whim
To assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb skins
Of innocence
A child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise
Supply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested
A mile in humble shoes, ten shades of blues come off the difference

Yeah, yeah, I recall the
First time I bumped heads with my head led to a dead bargain, a
"Thanks for nothin, lowlife" and a start of, "Beg my pardon,"
When a dust mite harbored spite it barely
Dents the cicada phase, blades averted
Decorate the backs of freedom fighters, servants pick those
Steeples higher, man the loose cannons
"Pannin for gold?" Nah panning for chance to land in camps branded with
"Push" stamped on their hand lets
Push, let's push up through the
Now, let's evoke a vow of
Zipped lips clipped to my peaking
Brow, I'm sleeping now, I seen immaculate hearts blemished
Under the mass of genie bottle hostages who wish that a
Third to her broken promises
Black spot of Gotham, fragile
Castle and master passageway
Even the innocent captives bleed
Bleed appleseed apple seed, leave me with a breeding
Hassle factor's feet
Pin the tail on the village idiot
Turn giddy click stern greet a burn it basics laid with the
Modes of neurotic nitpicking
Patrons and their pseudo potent
Patronage, ahh mood of the moment
Gloated in splendor of its
Greatness and I'm hella swamped
Truly moody in my days makeshift awakeness

Dig in your person
Now exhibit true audacity and passively hack reason to ribbons
And you're excused from the round-table admissions committee
Activist legends turned hostage in fallen cities
Dirty earthlings circling vision immaculate
Spin me dizzy in a crosswalk
My too far gone mastodon senses inspect relentless
For fitted boogie systems with crook addictions
Well sure my crown is formed of thorns
Yeah but my thorns are formed of sound
And I have found sound's what keeps me warm
When mornings born with frozen ground
Throw the rope down, pull me from where the buzzards cleared
The meat from the bones of you and your little bad-ass mad max musketeers
When the silhouettes of emaciated frames dance on a high-wire
Mistook for aspiring third world poster children
But is inserted ghost with dealin'
Dare to administer links like chieftain whats your forte
Knuckle dragger in disguise seeking the match made in your eyes
Friend it don’t take the wisest men in triplicate pacing to find
I don’t condone the blasphemy hatchery’s procreation
From the floods, to the fires, to the droughts, to the cyclones
Tidal waves, the twisters, tornadoes, and hail stones
Whirlwinds, tropical storms, blizzards and monsoons
All of which I witnessed prior to waking up inside my room
Look at the crook as I panic episode tantrums
Fuck hugging my cool
The edginess readies the Mach 9 quick draw hence the duel
The company of similars couldn't excite the motor
But hermit crab Aes home a-loner
One barrel of idioms and charcoal stick, courage under desire
Canopy draped beautiful messiah reluctant
Stuck in the pluck in the harp buzzing the fuzzing television mixer
Book of saturated matches and a half-made bed (sleep on my other half made bed)
Pick of the litter, litter of the pick
Pack leader will huff cannibal fumes, mechanical zoom
There's ample room
Stowaways inside the cargo bed
Said leech prior to firing up his barnacle magnet
Instincts leashing himself to where the wind splitting ice storms
And termite swarms are commonplace
I'm a trace this silver lining winding round the profit chase
I know there is good in you if one peels back the opulence
But I also know its ratio to bad don't feed my confidence
The nutrients moody tints of blue circle
The clues units of success being personal
Then sucked basic diversion
Rusty anchor budging for nothing
Wedged between aesop rock and a scarred face of frustrated fuck yous Bound by concern
I can't believe I'm still concerned
I can't believe sly children turn in their sleep over one-liners
While I yield to hear your burns
Color me out of my skull draggin' a wagon of creature features
And all I ever wanted was to aggravate the sleepers
Look self-crafted heroics murder worthless
Crash test ideologies, catalog alien doctrines type disturbance
Got em out, killing machines turn belly up
Buckled, the troubles I've seen
Coax twenty four sevens of wide eyes from day dreamers
Clean or dirty serpents in turn wish preference for the latter
Justified the germs birth cauterize the gashes after
On my left, one finger for each borough I can touch
On my right, one finger for each time that I wake up midsummer night
Who's cloaked in a pristine mantle of hellfire
But A-capital glaciers out the east slide lateral
Born for one task indeed
To spoil the citizen kane emote self this ugly duckling seed
Look I too am tired of draggin' the baggage over the seesaw seats
When the reapers turns mortals to caspers
See the plain and stone conjurable can't mimic the null
Of a billion troops holding matchsticks to empty cannons
Stand in for many moons when the sun hit the mountainside splendidly
Bask in the last warmth that be known to man's tangents
In the wink of an innocent starchild's eyelid drop he vanished
Managed to carve initials in the granite wall that damned it all up
I hung with cats that do the don'ts
Cats that forage through the moats
Hoping they'll open with sovereignty and a canteen deemed with prodigies

Let's connect the thrill of volume to a flat earth
Jaywalking a hook the past just passed the mere dragon bandwagon passengers
I'm sorry, we've never met, my name is driftwood
Thanks friend, good looking, I'll never see you again

Spangled in hooks dangled by anglers off the plank of burning books

Working class trash raped where racist hit their high

Billy was a coke fiend
Maggie was a cop

She pocketed the crack before they got far
Billy watches Maggie from behind steel bars

"Getting dusty in the cellar"

Yo
I always think about my sick friend
Stringing a ring around my wit's end
Thirteen loops later his feet hung inches out the pig pen
Motley day goblins brought up pillage to pass the stillness
With bad javelin tip dipped inside barreled black magic brilliance
Who rose at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier?
To capture the fascist fragment choreographed in traffic dancing for nickels
Hooked like sickle cells to the principles of comradery
One hope distortion odyssey sputters itself to my how not example sample
Divvy the bread crust while considering the littering
I don't pity the head rush or the whimpering, spill
Anchor to rock bottom, rocks bottom packs a ravenous catalyst
Sprung alacritive, leashed by the carnal tirade
I choked when the cage bird sings it stings
Springs me up delirium to stitch the clipped wings
I sink instinctively brinked through while clinging the shrieking souls
Mourning the death of annal logs /analogs and quality control
Quality control, stand still string up the banner
From the beehive to the anthill; rag dummy
Incorporate the unison of Vikings Ship Rowers PLUS the perfection
Of the twice the Birds with half the Stone Throwers, speak your assessment
My communicative hindrance pleads the needs
Of a billion hungry victims gripped by the hell that's split to splinters
Shimmying up the mast of natives and it's league marvels
One component short of shock and mass burial, breeze
Broken penny bank fragments float up at stagnant seas
Dirty work plus applicants with chatter box disease
Iron bandit, giving the stars, the head balloons and rubies
Asked for many moons and I can't stand it any more

Is that how I feel when I sling?
And the regulars were so amazed

I'm the mightiest slinger of them all!

And a time to run and a time to split

"Getting dusty in the cellar"

I run a funny race, malnourished monarchs and loopy admirals
Where 99.9% swear by their broken axles
I built boats of a pack rat bats of bully club swung
Post utility inhalants nail it to stability and sail it
Lopsided starboard bow, crooked mass makeshift
Patching holes with chewing gum and sticking sail to dirty bases
Observe me sitting with my eyes tied to the clock, Cause
I know that once that wind kicks up you and your motors left rope to the dock
And it's the, art of clarity married to slender extension
Of blue sky over happy neighborhood
String on my ring has left me dancing like wooden dummies in a paper nature
Merry etiquette is a door nail, Friends is little brittle dolls of paper
In assembly, I tremble with a crocodile smile
Hiding a fish out of water complex provided upon entry
Now if I, were to fall to speeds
To levigate the game plan, would you honestly impede?
I mean I guess, I can just divorce me from the rest
And blame my chemical imbalance for the fact I've made a mess
But my loyalty supply hints on which inkling I should run with
And I'm thinking that damn town crier's about to fill this here bucket
It's that, grand precious that precious that part of you wants to touch
And part of you just wants to sit and be impressed with
Tainted agony induct in barnacle attachments
Mood swinging upon the barnstorm with perpendicular traffic
Spread, Circa 4000 circuitry burns cicada wings
Above alkadiene Townsman spoon-fed the shadow
I'm tired of being wired into the thief ratio
It's gnawing a hole through my scheme so I leave (know what I mean?)
It is the molotov cocktail hour
Haven't I brought you blessings without number?
*Record Scratch in*
They have plenty of nothing and nothing is plenty for them
Yea
I've never had it so good

"Getting dusty in the cellar" x3Embed
Che-che-che-check it
This is for all those super scientifical, uh, "Geniuses" turned "Underground Thug", who think Hip Hop is Dead but can't get their fucking style out of '94
Point to us like we're not hip hop
(Point to us like we're not hip hop x3)


I brought that genuine shit in '96
Before you knew the underground or independent existed
I watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick
After stepping to KCR lit and flexing my shit
No gun talk, no gimmicks, just rounds of raw-dogging
Dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering
A hardcore poetic informed without burglary
Potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me
Everytime I prescribe a new pill--revolution
Quickly defined the standard for indie rap distribution
Arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks
"Bad Touch Example" that soon became bucks
Had everybody sprung wondering where I came from
Screaming out "Independent as fuck" with an insane tongue
With an indelible squad of design monsters
Innovating the styles that made biters look like imposters
So we scripted an album and signed to Rawkus
Selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit
Preposterous sonics taking the world hostage
Classic hip-hop bombage dirty with style progress
Now I've come from the '80s juvenile Brooklyn
Where cats was like: "Gimme that subway pass, kid. Good lookin."
Now someone else is taking a ride with what's mine
So I had to develop styles with a death device cooked in
So when I battled in basements I had eight sentences
Waiting way before the four you had laced in
And I was taught to be patient (Why?)
Only faggots switch they shit up just to get famous
So when I finally blew up I remained sick
Earning respect in ghettos and 'burbs for word placement
Back when the independent scene remained faceless
We were the only crew who promised your ass we'd take it
Mold it, shape it, living outside the matrix
Hold it, make it, more than miniature major labels
Hold it sacred, living it for the culture
Told ya plainly, protected it from the vultures
That's why I always get respect from true soldiers
While half of the critics claim it every year: "Hip hop's over."
FUCK YOU, hip hop just started
It's funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it
But true veterans'll give dap to those who started it
Then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit
New slang, new thought, new sound
Who's heart you thought you had?
You clown, you don't, you drown
I won't dumb it down, I'm dumbing now for these rounds
I'm a live mothefucker plus I'm gunning for clowns
You're a mime motherfucker, don't be coming for pounds
So you can break out of that invisible box, you're not down
My favorite ones are the ones who started that young rap about
Comic books, spaceships, and Obi-Quan one
And even though they were soft they had fun
But they couldn't break out the frame of the town they came from
Some of these faggots used to send me their demos
I'm keeping their puppy styles in the Company Flow kennels
But since they had no identity from the start
They started to resent the scene when they couldn't become a part
They've been failing for years and call themselves Vets, that's bold
Motherfucker, you're not a Vet you're just old
I'll slap the shit out of you to continue my nerd rap
Making this money fist over fist, fuck what you heard
Jukie cats talk about boom bap and golden ages
Patting themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit
I've been putting out vinyl since '93 and never looked back once
And ya'll trying to chase me
You don't innovate because you can't innovate
It's not a choice despite what you might tell your boys
Keep your identity crisis under the table
I always knew who I was and I'll always be more famous

Who are you down with bitch?I'm sorry, dog, I dreamt the foulest shit
There was this rabbit foot talisman, drowning out of my arm-span
What's fouler, was the other farmhand's growing gills, and shark fangs
What's fouler, was my torso stripped to ribbons, in the marshlands
But I'm up now
Let's get this window pane, and shut the fuck down
Down by the river, where the litter sits -
And lion-heart critters, smoke dope, and act like illiterates
I ran with a brat pack of loose bolts, and high social maladjust-ees
Sacred, numb and boundless went to St. Protocol, cut me, well -

Whistle while you work, like a canary lung,"All work -And no play makes Jack a dull boy", to carry drugs

Where there's crack whores and corrupt pigs killing cats trying to crack cases
My boombox runs on a baboon heart transplant (This is hell!)
I got a poltergeist on a leash trained by Carroll Ann herself
Two Thousand something...
When technology ate itself glutton
Every move I make's from a robot gepetto pressing a red button
It's Vietnam in the fumes...
So I run with cannibals that bite the hand that feeds cuz it tastes better than the food
The prickly outer shell's genetic, it helps defense mode
But it also helped to fuck up a couple of sacred friendships
Watch a six legged insect crawl out of the billy goat beard
Watch a sick makeshift bitch threat fall out when the filthy smoke clears
Watch the insect's stinger sting threat till it has sweat a bullet
Sweat a full clip, sweat a river, dead the bullshit, sail away and wither
You're the kind of cat that rolls a pimped out Caddy
Dropped with rims and limousine tints bumpin Enya
Insert laughter here
I wanna rap a lot and stack cheddar by the fistful
But for now, I walk into the store with a pocket full of huhh...
Excuse me, man. (alright ok)
Can I... Can I borrow a dollar or something to eat?
(alright ok) I'm... I'm hungry
I'm saying yo... (alright ok) (Look at that..)
I'm homeless, man. (Look at that bum) (alright ok)
I fought for this country, man. (yeah)
Sleep on park benches... starvin'
All I need is like a loosey and like a sandwich or somethin', man..
Wiping my ass with the Daily News man... c'mon man...
Sleepin' with squirrels... (Oh my god, What are you doing with that squirrel?)2Embed

Suit the hell hounds with blades and chain lengths

Hunger pain, chump change tell it to how his belly get

Food, clothes, medicine, alumni
Bum, I got the skin on the teeth between my fingertips and stellar
Let's bet it melts together
Let's get these men some shelter
Three hots and a cot with Quaaludes
On a pillowcase left on an ultimately cordial gesture by the staff, (Staff)
It's a bath house for brave soldiers
When they coordinate to fornicating whores in maid's clothing
Sip a hot mocha, kick-up-chug up to the apple box
Frankie says, "Relax", 20 says he snaps, safe wager
Hell, 90 percent sensitive jubilee

Iron chef Lithuania christen kitchen stadium

Save me some, scallywags hold your breath
The curmudgeon's gun dusty like the road to death
Bag a pin stripe my lizard kisser no kill switch
Just a guilty gizzard wanna recommend a pill slip
I wipe placenta off my face in the height of the disco era
Cruise through liquid bubble gum, fever, death, and Christmas sweaters

You know what I'm saying?
The engineer, obsession right here
Uh huh
Like this

I spit with an immense amount of power
Sparks flame showers, cowards, cower, underneath our
Storm clouds that indicate the acid rain hours
Now or, never, ever, ending on a bad note
Ripping a crab's throat, for spitting a bad quote
(Blueprint what's your approach?)
I smash black folk and white folk alike for jokes with mics
And make a Kodak moment out of the most boring open mic
I'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again
Fuck around and forget just how whack it's been
I'm a bad man (Why's that?)
I catch bullets in my molars, body slam boas
And take flight with the weight of the world on my shoulders
And play David Blaine on any chains that hold us
What started out as food for thought
Turned into thoughts to turnin' crews into food in hopes to satisfy my
Insatiable appetite to dine on lifeforms, small planets and satellites
Your solar system is my condiment;
I vomit comets, and don't sweat the small things and nonsense
Every dog has his day and even more so in rhyming
So I decided that I'd never play the fire hydrant
Or grab the mic sounding lazy, worn down and tired;
Cats don't really fall off they just get uninspired
But before you, get a reason to ever diss us
I'll drop an ill LP and disappear like Bobby Fischer
But this is, the building block of all that is
And what it is, is Alchemy

Nervous clerks flirtin' with hurly burly chemistry
Graffiti burner urchin merging with a certain herd to jerk and serve your centerpiece
My zig-zag bully balance gallops with a fiery outline bound and bomb y'all pastel poets belly up (I'll tell you what)
Born style in 4 dimensions count 'em:
Three to take 'em to ya muck, one to build a world you'll never touch and I'm a pilot
Delirium, serum, poison arrangement
Come browse through an idyllic storm and suck the raw enslavement
With a grim-style stinger creeping out the basement
Encased in wild ritualistic visions of sacrificial bitch cadence
For all my iron giant soldiers with a metal fist up shielding mother nature
From a fatal wrist cut, story, I respect you
(So why they blaming you for the cats that sleep while the earth turns?)
Yeah I had em' up all night praying I'd re-release Music For Earthworms

Big bad Bazooka Tooth, I came to break bread
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em... ah, fuck it, yo!

I pull the elephant tranq out of my neck
Gaffle a tank, count up the chips, wrastle the fangs off of my fist
Flood a little soldier blood over the ogre acres
On some holiday in Cambodia with motor-home appraisers
Pagans fade into the Kodachrome - now, later
With a lid to brow staple
Revisit the cobra loading zone
Molar foaming, but he hold his own wound
Cauterized, by the Zippo he had stole that afternoon
And my dog tags jingle by the monster island heart he built
Grew up with a jughead crown tilt and tardy slip
"Be all you can be" just never soothed us (Nope!)
You lost me in that part about scrubbing piss with a toothbrush
Holler scum's lullaby
Live from the ultra-fly, sham city bunker
Where the coldest cults multiply alarmingly
Hush little baby, timeout!
The black market mockingbirds can not sing a lick
But learn to peck your eyes out
Of commission with love, out a tradition of wraiths
Pick on the visions that buzz, bet on the kitten's escape
Solder the piston to pump - out a veteran amplifier
And magnify through the same lens that set the ants on fire
Flush the moppet hootenanny
Who could fancy, honor circuit when the circle's every duke is clammy?
Trooper, scoop the food in pantry
Ante up, stupid!
May delusion feed em foofi candy
And pry the gold out of his tooth when lamping
Pocket all you can now

To the cold cutlery outfit, slaughter beef and cow tip
Pour the chief some fountain soda, motor prone to pen the holy opus
And pry this monkey off the Scoliosis like

Jumping on and off my Sex Pistol's bullets

Like every other week these fucking fanzines forget if they spit or swallow
Too bad your inner sheep never forgets to follow
Cause my inner greed to feed your hate for loving us is hostile
Fortunate for me, it coincides with what comes natural
So the mongrels that I run with turn the "fuck you's" into fast food
Like a little freak sick of the 3 o'clock bully knuckle dust
Nursing his last shiner, finds the shoebox in his mother's truck (uh-oh)
Tomorrow's extra curricular punching bag
Will finger daddy's widow maker out a brown lunch bag (bang)
This is where the hunch back snake oil peddlers
Stuck under the burgundy sky of spaghetti westerns
Tend to bubble up, weathermen huddle up
Today, the son of one too many "yes sir's"
Kings his checkers, watch the double jump
Back with a platter of hot leeches that'll drink up-every bloody drop down
To the last diseases, it's A-E-S-O-P-R-O-C-K, the peak twister
Defender of the son of Vaughn Bode's Cheech Wizard
I used to pray the treatments got easier with my aging
Like Serotonin weekends was merely comedic hazing
Wrong, but along his travels located the key to world peace:
Kill every motherfucker but me
You cool with that? Cool, bang
You? Cool, hang
You? No? Uh..bang? Cool
Sorry, dog, rules is rules

Parachute ratty, one bunk cord now the air is scooped badly
Dripping out the sticks like a twig-tweed hammock
Miter cut the cables for that quick, clean transit
Miser took the big screen; Panic made a business card
Ankle out of whack, painkiller tobacco scrap
We navigate the yellow corn hype for the barn
When the spotlight swiveled hard right over the farm
Post up, 3 cheers for the gimp
Spread thank you (3 on the right)
Limp to the door, splint what he mangles (3 on the left)
Yea I knew the percentages
But the numbers were unaware of the grand finale's emphasis
And over the scent of a thousand dead dogs
Agent Zip Zooka swore to pull it off, GAMEFACE

I shimmy up out of the fox-hole, disorderly
Only after having logged every cadaver accordingly
High scores keep our automatons enthralled
(There is no cause iller than no cause at all)
Okay, if his perspective is merked, sneaky detective work is aborted
And it's no longer whisper-mode on the red alert
No bed of dirt sniper rifle peeking out the bunker (uh!)
Now I'm center city looking for something to puncture (*gunshot*)
Help me up, the numbers of the heroes sat at suppers
Treat the public like a tin can, riddled before it plummets (Brrrap!)
But, adrenaline can lead to lazy-eye hassles
So he missed the little boy inch the pin out the pineapple (Heh)
Thats funny...Bumps into the steel-toe
Thats lovely, sum it up in (Oh, hell no!)
And just as quick as the parachute cable snipped
I was rag-doll, horizontal, two limbs short of fixed
Link a baby pool around the standard issued weaponry
While fading as a blemish in civility's memory
They will step over the body for the looting..

Well, any asshole with a book of matches can light a fire fresh;
Make that sucker burn for days, I'll be impressed
Surfing to bash the coach of bigot procreation baked in fanciful
Then scurry up the grass to roll his marbles off the anthill
I know girth and good nature but recognize absentee ballots
And sappy ballads couldn't fill the void (No they can't)
It's James and the Giant Tugboat Complex and he's annoyed
(No one's asking you to build an ark brother)
Yeah, it's fashion
I'll find my own bullies to shake a finger at
Then realign mine eyes in divine justice
Plus this uncontrollable laugh
When those Amber Waves of Grain finally crash
Brimstone, cloned with legs and dim poems, 10 little Zen crafts
Things cooperate like paper doll participant litigants
Picket well around a burner style clinic
Acid for the basics, Ph-imbalance to burn the malice martyrs faceless
Then fabricate day trips
I wanna be the halo that jumps off the brain
Of the genius who decided some pictures deserve frames
(God and I are on first name basis)
Yeah I call him "God", he calls me "Jesus"
When I lost my religion, he fell to pieces
Blame. Dragon. Up hell's creek interrupting a devil pageant
Starfighter settle into madness

I walk a mile with a leash attached to your freak seminar
It's a modern sensation on the boulevards of maintenance
To sweep your broken hopes under the rug then hug the playpen
It's revolution pushing through the loose pins
Of the straight-jacketed maverick classed in a bunk category
They had him parallel with a tattered glory division
Aka them who drink dreams out a thermos with a whiskey after-burn
It's like, 9 o'clock wake (I'm up), spit obscenities
My girl ties on my cape, smoke a bone, then work my deviltry
The clear day's laced with a classic mother nature thunder chaser set
That got my paper crane's wings wet (oh no)
Voyeurist amendments lacked expansive coverage in the syllabus
I dance for chuckles while you man the keyhole grilling post (that's fine)
I done my chores according to God's schedule
With coffee holding the wheel and nicotine working the pedals
Metal-edged cadence that tends to repel the bevel
Kettle screeching out the operetta (operetta)
I live to autograph the iron curtain with dove's backfeather pens spurting magma
Curséd television earns the burdens of my Cleopatra
Minor, (M-M-Major). Disperse slap on the wrist
For the tenants lacking arms to harbor the rarity of thick friendship

One of these rebels could level the marked city
But the N.Y. uber alles governor's picky
I'll be the jenky Jesus for the species you bleed with

Jump guns through the ninth gate
Jump guns like a noon six burner lit up on the ninth pace
Even set among a portion conformed to the blind stage
Never lured by the formal watching imported wines age
We bow to the gusto mustered by the mecha-bot
Plowed by the public, ushered out the letterbox

Yo, challenge an Ox member, get a valve severed
Found your body in the desert (Scavenger's dessert)

I'm tired of cats tryin to sum me
You can't add that far yet, that counting is far fetched
I treat MC like K-9s
Throwin words at they face to see if they bite when they catch
I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette
Now you standing there wit razors in your head like barrettes
Man, if the mic had ass cheeks
The sticker in my hand would say priority seating
And man, I don't know if it was me or you
But your girl was on my dick like she was teethin'
You play the role, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you

And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers

I boogie with picketer vision, carbon based stickler
City piss aroma, therapy coma, clone sitter
Itching to pigeonhole villain soul magnet
Feelers activate
Passion ate the germ, and the book met the worm
I hold a book of matches captive to flash if
The sunbeams flatline
Via thick fatigue episodes, brewed in batches
The flirt of cursed perks nursed broken skeleton patches
One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center
Housing style pageants
My little limbs lasso katydid wings
While mankind's babysteps break dirt and demon
I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of
Mass times weight times tamed semantics
Encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage
To hell with plastic, we edit splendid
Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, apprehend it
Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again
It still never renders suspended 'bove finicky picket fences
Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts
Start with cadaver parts and a blueprint
He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear
Let the tears braid
And skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade
Gold-plated tomb or spittoon
I couldn't see
I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree
The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance
Was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance
Chorus 2xEmbed
I fell asleep again
I wasn't ready for it
Yo

The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season
I imagine sloppy seed handling evoked a stroke of tardy planting
And the crops we'd have harnessed mid-November
Had only brushed the blossom bracket
Then soon sacrificed lives to icicle jackets when the frost hit
I sunk to find the warmth beneath the mosses
With a plan to tunnel past after the rains have run their courses
But alas, the portraits of these frostbit corpses tortured in the grass
Offered this torch supporter one tall glass of nauseous
And I'm asking you: Why's the spy supply hiding in strangers
When they know atop the food chains I could spot biters for acres?
Now be gracious, these minstrels turn a bully cycle civil
By dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels
The upbringing of self-styled freedom brigade investors
And their studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors
Puts it down
It's down beneath your sappy sing-a-longs
Let's take it further down, we'll let Dante decide which ring I'm on
Nova
The elders took positions and the fans marched
Parched, plain and steamed
Hawking the rain in my canteen
Now I'm like point:
I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads
Counterpoint:
During my famine I never got broke your bread
Well, equation of intrigue, yes, yes
Lemme fence sit for a bit
These tense lips need soaking before I hand out tokens
Shut the fuck up
Drama like kabuki with a heart of dirt
Skull fucked cross bones hence my birth
It hurts

Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want
Sometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut
Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I'm tryin' to walk on top of sunshine
But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning

Crowning the glory of our advance
Fire ants to water beetles
These Freemasons adjacent to pacing pins and needles
Pupil turned pedagogue, benediction to my dream
Beaming a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine
Check it
I'll pluck the petals off a classic blood rose one at a time
Gripping the stem in the right; invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline
It's a metaphor for nighttime
Ante up the slight cost of exhaustion
To salute the moon above paradise lost and you're a spectator, stringent
Inch by sacred inch shoveling coal into my earthworm soul
(You should know!)
Burrow up through the dirt with bloody digit
Lick my knuckles clean
Noting the corporate clusters holding hands
'round the abode of the damned
Now what's your poison?
Starlight in a maser with a nicotine chaser
Sip it clean, savor the taste to sit and dream later:
The eyelids pivot back upon the hinges
20 miles across the glassy eyed window of wonders to passers by
Now I'm 6 foot 4 with a 6-floor walk up just to recline
With no free time. The alarm storms at nine
My daytime's on some, 'Yes, sir. Ok, sir. Right away sir
Sir, do you mind if I breathe, sir?
Oh you do? Well excuse me, sir, fuck you.'
I breathe slow
I run in with these fantastic amalgams
Painting casket-bound careers to peers gunning with classic albums
Security's the javelin, catch it
Labor
Clocked in in '76 and haven't clocked out ever since
Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want
Sometimes I take it all and still can't fill this pitfall in my gut
Must not sleep. Must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers

But it's ridiculous at times. That's why I'm touring with this warning

Feel it, it's like that5Embed
Sturdy bridges, decorated with dirty pigeons
A vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess
A junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in
A batty senior citizen flashing that awful teethless grin
I saw a corner store merchant rest on a milk crate with a stog'
A pierced nose, a model with a stalker, cheap hooker, jay walkers
A table on a sidewalk with four old men slappin' dominos down
A city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town
I saw vandals catching tags and Puerto Rican flags
I saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting
I saw a blind man with a dog screaming someday I'll see it all
And then he sat down with his hammer and saw
Business men with multi-colored ties, cashing their checks
A Nazi with tattoos on his neck, a Vietnam War vet
A Caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his dames
A thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses
I saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair
A mother smackin' the grin off her child, replaced it with a stare
A pothole, a storefront with a broken open sign
A hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's closing time
I see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver
A squatter, a grandfather, an angry right-to-lifer
I can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street
And kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds
I see a rat, a roach, a bat approach, a happy student
A black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it
I see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and barrettes
I see a teen mother with Similac, pacifier, and regrets
Oh, a day turned stale, a hammer with a rusty nail, a failed marriage
A universe of brick buildings slightly off balance
A challenge, I see a chance to add real colors to my favorite palette
Raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents
I see a crack in the sidewalk
A slide show of sick civilians gripping bottles like idiots
Sitting inside bent meridians
There's a fun house ooh, a sun spout
Spraying yellow beams above yellow back dreams
And children in the hydrants
Hybrids, I see sirens
The wall to the glamor standard
A dead bird, a red curb
A bus stop where commuters wait to have their souls towed off to work
I see the slapdash habits of bike messengers pausing
To huff that good leaf on the way to damage packages for peddlers
Oh my lord, I see bandwagons, all aboard
A carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury
I see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors
Maybe I should sit up on my fire escape a little moreYou might also like4Embed
Well, so we meet again
(He said he's grown spiritually
Since the last time we'd spoken)

Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects
Where the jackals sit and watch the pedagogues clash flesh
Poison function accompanied by six armor-clad
Black horse and buggy mechanisms
Tugged a portion of my severed vision (my severed vision)
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket
With a shoestring budget
Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now)
But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen
Fee fie et cetera
I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin'
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin' to paddle back home
I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention
By eclipsing doom litigants hatched to bash these picket fences
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering
And when the groom presents the ring
The bride commence the blistering
It's textbook magnificently crude
Prototype king berserker module
Inserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal (treasure)
Treasure, loose cannons span the starboard bow
Of the clipper ship dipped in truth famine pressure (pressure)
Cabin fever meter peggin' ludicrous
Beautiful cartoon troopers
Swallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
I rock ready, aim, fire while y'all rock ready, fire, aim
Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame
Merit badge, marksman, or poacher?
It's all the same (right?)
So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain

I'm floating this homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window
Left an S.O.S. infested bottle nestled in his grip so
With a prayer circle release party and hearty wild bellow
I observed him fly ten feet
Then drop the bottles to the devils
Fertile circle turned fertile crescent via bad investment
Despised every second, but I guess I learned my lesson
If I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim
There'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system
Sticky panoramic contaminant planted
In conjunction with phantom assumption
Gutterbug alumnus candidates
Well, I promise you I'll man the lighthouse
Just to help guide in your ship
If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch)
Godspeed, straitjacketed ragged approach
To circle suns via folklore pollutants derived strictly
From a B.C. generation disgust
Community movement alluding to a

Life manner, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer
Trying to build a fence around these magic beans

But God, I'm scared to death of God
I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans

Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge

Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves
And still my shepherd can't administer
The proper push and pulls
I push the ghouls to man overboard
Pull the bulls onto my sword
And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor
Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar
Got a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over
The recipe's designed to plug the appetite for continuity
By stitching togetherness theme congruents (beautifully)
I peel back hearts and lodge greed physics in the chambers
Cauterize the wound and heads like

Stereotypical Grinch bashing your pumpkin

Release Japanese beetle swarm to counter the spread of bitch crops
Demolish the harvest and herd colony out immediate
One massive attack, hunted, confronted and gutted
Most pungent component cloned in outrageous bunches
From the grimacing faces to the knots in my shoelaces
I'm a show you all the phases of a fuck up (Yeah)
Plucking the petals but every rose had its thorn
Consider that first warning, second will be good times, laughs and epitaphs
As a matter of basic principle next I set my boat a sail
I won't always be there for your tugging on my coat tails
Family stuck, voyage of the S.S. Martyr
Who you think put that unseen iceberg in the water?
Manufacture flotsam and jetsam from out your charter
We got the once pushovers pushing back a little harder now, blink

As boy in the bubble huddled up to simple Simon subtle
Born tomahawk. Shock the peanut gallery loopy
Debate the cutesy, groupie, Kewpie doll community
And I'm hung in a virtual skin and bones emaciated ringworm
Circus freak bloodthirsty intern trainee urchin feast
With a delectable style compiled of that which stands
To buff a child's yellow brick vision of slick living
I observe the stories from my fire escape observatory
First I herd the glory, then desert the herbs that word it poorly, understood?
Well, maybe a pat on the back for the lucky losers
Who truly felt they were born to touch the music
I catalog cats as welcome mats, and for the ones
Insisting on dimming the stars I wipe my sneakers extra hard
I wish upon a penny toss that every servant will betray his gatekeeper
And leap to reap the freedom fighter mad galaxy
Huff the war gas vapors and cram hard for tomorrow

This is not your ordinary ballad
With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black knight on a white horse
Or a white knight on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing and random
Princess raise the drawbridge
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
Can't forget that not-so-perfect
Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle...)
And it goes a little something like this..

Moon walking a broken soul pedigree incessant
Gut the cruddy frame
The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
Cutthroats the result of pulp jokes soaked in poacher constants
And not a jewel amidst coal wander prominent.. honor (honor)
I bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
Sew your first martyr stitch
Join damaged mammoth brigading caper
Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
I keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses
In case the hackers snatch the plumage

Twisted mighty fearful twisted and tonight I got front row seats at the d-d-d-d-dead concert
And you're in it, Ichabod
Running out of morals for my allegory... (moseying)
My kind of people will sell only circles. (woseying)
With my eyes patched in a not so new universe
So I beckon and bray but my pretty bird just ain't muting the many...

Oh it'll be soon (real soon)
Balloon immune to doom blend
I ain't ditchin' the kitchen 'til every spoon bends
A glance along tomorrow, sorry
Looking lot of hopefuls was the rain dance
My little flint never dreamed would flutter potable
See I sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste
Contemporary taste made my lip drop in the first place (incoming)
Hmm, You want to be a Czar?, idolize fallen heroics
Recognize root of the worship, search and hold it
Who put the fun in dysfunctional?
I, prodigal son combustible, donkey-punching pinholes
In uncomfortable Zen conjunctionals for good (good)
The bear cub slop a goblet of dirt wine
I nurse a single application of introvert, serpentine
Now a sunset without a scrape of red an-an-and a plastic bag noise
Sunk down around his head sick-sick-sick-sick...
Stealing a peak
There's sickness likeness in the roofer's eyes and his alone
And nothing terrible happened to the bag
Wrongs spilled off in...
And brought on out the clouds...
The hiss cuts out...
Spill its voice...
And the piano...
And the window full of...
Star is fresh... kept

I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
I've got charcoals in my heart, but I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart

And before, when I said 'Shut the fuck up, it's none of your business'
That was to be in vain
Be sure to lock that up when you're all finished
Finished yet? Now uhm...
I usually finish this number with uh... my skull open
Everybody rally around the novel burners, spit, murder the matches
Where the junkies trade diseases and the gullible trade passions
Then the masses wanna lean on me like "oh captain, my captain"
Not considering maybe this orphan hosts morbid attachments...

Button, button, who's got the button
Take my name, please...
Button, button, who's got the button
Leaks the little gentle man made of lightning inside my lock-box
Oh, you like to help with coats wait unti you see what I got in this here locket

This is not your ordinary ballad

This fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring;
The prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing
I'm broke. I know a walking corpse who'd spit icicle dagger to slit throat
Quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope (H-O-P-E)
I paint a portrait from my cell called life inside the tortoise shell
Tortured
Orbiting hell's orchard intrigued but not compelled
I smell a hint of charred child flesh sweeping through my quarters
Order one canteen of liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter
Now is you is the villain of my kabuki hologram
Cuz I hobble with hollow hands
Please pan the nozzle
We see intent to re-invent dream application with homage to ancients
But honor modern replacements circling now basics
I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tipping the Petri dish (fresh)
Beached fish on the shores where the feast of wits eat the corpse
Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible
That's a harp of a different color but the song remains identical
I am not a crook
I cook the wick at both ends
Just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope dance
Life
Sight beyond
Fire ant with a hunger pain gut be gone
Belong to something civil, saint, cuz this Rembrandt paints on
And it's a cold canvas lodged in the gut of Atlantis
Some present impressive lung, some truly learn what a death chant is
I alone personify mankind's collective sulk
As a result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp in bulk
Face it
Die
Place it on the shelf next to the portrait mommy gave you of the day it rained
But y'all posed by the slave ship anyway
Make it rain 'til the levy breaks
My fetus breeds as a combine of father time and his sweetest concubine, wine
And it saddens me like televised casualties
I'll be hung in the village square in exactly 5 minutes;
You don't want to miss it
As a token of my discontent regarding the equation
I'm officially closed for consultation

Wing of wax? Or wing of gold leaf? Choose one
Float or plummet twenty thousand cold leagues
My nourishment's provided in the summer
So then I wonder, how y'all chasing dreams when what's tangible still outruns you
Hail dirty doll immaculate performance
Warm as the march of a billion torches forward to burn what I'm born in
Cut and paste alertness to current settings provided quick
Shimmy the pirate ship mass, spot the island, sound the siren
And about face
Let's salute the embraced pertinent generals
Who turned innocent hermits to burning spectacles
Flirtin' with a serpent working overtime, drain the battery
Siphon the poison to flood his majesty's hatchery
I was riding on a yellow bus to where the brush thickens
And it ain't exactly plush pickings
I'd rather take the time to burn every last bridge
I've ever crossed beneath the sun
Than live my life knowing you may one day follow me over one
Snake bite, breath too heavy to hold
Caught up in the wake of the red witch trying to swim it
Ran for the sake of dead cliques stripped of idyllic image
Steal a sloppy earth meal
Feed my pottery wheel to model colossal vision
Thrill, trucking with a bucket of pennies
I'ma drag my sneakers through the dirt like alligator bellies 'til the cloud burst
Honor and a loud thirst submersed in a trap
Little drummer boy vs. thunderclap

Collapsed and left "I'm sorry" tacked to you door
Pitching my back to hell's kitchen
Back burner murder machinery released regardless of the pardons
Hitching my life to the leash of one minstrel
Sick of same window different visual
Same agnostic hostage different ritual
Plague, cooperative super colony clash

At least I think I was here asleep
Is it possible? Conceivable?
That I sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berserk?

Escaped briefly back to my apartment to park in front a fan
And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
Contestants get the New York home game with real life shoot 'em up-action

While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'm a never give, I'm juiced off projection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born-agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the zed, I bait this data for my pledge
To bathe a traitor of the twice forgotten favors that he bled
And not a creature stirred
It reeks of subway metal, bevel edged journalist chin-on-fist shenanigans
Re-coin mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room
Mummified mannequins with future clenched adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This amalgam circus got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in the circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds
To see which one could track your trail and serve you, sucker
I lay the law down upon its belly while my foot
Dug in between the 3rd and 4th disc yelling "Break yo' self!"
I finally actualized data commission
Past penny tip jar donation arrangement, but a far fetch from stability
Took a hard pledge early on
Blood donor to drum dozer, plowing the metronome, home
Blown caddy-cornered to cockeyed sound booster
Sensationally seismograph
Stabbing away on stone tablet to sketch a grouchy future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down
Sample of cancelled development, courtesy America
Land of the freebase, home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt caught pinball blinker and citizens 1-X
Weren't steadied for this leaning grievance with dilapidated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece and sweat a bit to make my wookie ends meet
Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper out hierarchy
Passionate while they whine on some "Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie" shit
Suck the proverbial silver spoon 'till their parents quit apparently
Parasol spinning casually like

So you want to be a carpenter, do you?
Well it takes more than a hammer, boy
You're gonna need blueprints and a will to build, and...
Straighten your cap! you look like you've been through a war
Wipe that grin off your mug, you got a sturdy frame?
Sluggish posture just won't cut it
You're gonna need schooling, and, and, and take notes!
And god if I catch you yawning again you're gonna regret ever asking for my help
And dammit you gotta hustle, this is a slacker-free zone
And, where's my pencil? Go get your hard-hat
Here's a nickel, go get us a ruler and a saw and a drill and lots of graph paper...
Yo..
I used to have a rope ladder but tattered were the rungs
I strung it from the highest willow, trying to hug the sun
The seventh level buckled and I tumbled from the summit
Now I'm back to re-climb and this time light my cigarette from it
My stitch in division/division warfare's numb enough to soak suddenly in a bullet bath and skip stones in the morning
Is a flying color phantom tantrum explicable?
Sit and pull the petals off wild flower patches, magic happens!
Behold, pity the lowlife parish?
Doom City barracks left remorse coursed on a horse-drawn carriage by the torch of Polaris
To the badlands, where every bridge collapse right where the crowd stands
Where the witches are fireproof and every preacher's a madman

Slept with sticks and stones in my pillowcase
Ooh my born flight simulator picks barnacles off the tugboat belly
Left my spirit home in a shoebox in case I die
Got a rugged smoke-green halo floatin' inches off the swamp
Had that phase when the deviltry contacts a sparkle in my eye
Now step back from the reservoir and let the settlers drink (Right!)

My sincere addiction imbalance stems from a vintage grimace slap to the muck of
Ancestral branch camped on the vessels
Yes and I abide, the laws of the hidden desert survived
And every peasant present teetered it on the crescent less deprived
With the exception of pleasant finale binges on the great endangered interests
Of phantom brigades slaving to save that princess
I double the negative (Double the negative), to no avail, no promised benefits
Just delegates peddling pairs of negatives
With magnified magnanimous appearance sandy sinners in opinion shut
Now what of the madness fragments?
Stagnant
How to make a vision sing while twigs cling to your pigeon wings
Fission militia, indent bent to split blood in hell's kitchen sink
Organize civility simpleton citizen mixers, then kiss the sky in unison
Sinister city-blistered corporate hooligans
All I really want's a nickel to feed my little pig
Redefine big dig, three cheers to the product
Consumer populace feed but never dreamed of the process
On a slanted advantage point saw the makeshift criminals date rape the hostage
Dream away the plain pain, yeah but it seeps through the cracks
And drips from the ceiling and smells the rich scent of my tracks
All I ever really wanted was a jungle, and a jungle I got
See it ain't the vision it's the plot that makes me stop
Try it again. I don't want to (Repeat 8x)
I'm not even interested anymore
Try it one more timeEmbed
Burn it down...

Pad the circles 'round your life
To capture all the sides you sight
Magic tricks where skeptics sink
The ice is thin, stay off the lake
Waiting for a clock to punch
Wish I could breathe and stop for lunch
If I stop to count the leaves on only one of these here trees
Not sure that I know what's pure
Born to kill the insecure
Some respect, some resent, some remain from start to end
Wear my heart on my short sleeves
I'm stuck out here, I lost my keys
From the roof I watch the street
And pray for those that's caught beneath

As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs
As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs

I dunno what I have left
To give other than truth and breath
Angel when she shuts her eyes
Like we will leave to my demise
Between my time is short
About to start my last resort
Wake me up when it's time to make babies
Talkin planet earthquakes
Tied the laces, touch the ground
Let emotions ruptured now
As long as I know right from wrong
I'll be ok I'll sing my songs

I wanna lift every yellowbrick
I've never felt pressure to have to justify my selfishness
At least not to you and yours
Maybe just my friends and fellowships
As long as the mood is somehow linked to my enhanced development
I swear they'll understand!!!
There's a storm outside my tenement
Beats upon my windows with Mother Nature's adrenaline
I guess that's why my homie Blockhead stays glued to the television
Now I look less intelligent
Cuz I'm the one that tried to bear the elements and lost
Well it's warm by the filament
Huddled up close in the company of all my relatives
Stories, laughs, black coffee and honest-to-God sentiment
Cocooned inside the unified efforts to all get settled in
Away from where the rain pours!
Well count your delegates
Weed out the bums who practice migration other than elegant
Of course I realize the filtering procedure's delicate
But let devils inside to collide with your overzealousness
And fall to rock bottom
Spot 'em with their carelessness
The urge could burst to turn even those pacifist to militant
You can't even have half of free second
To become jealous in
You gotta aim, fire and aspire to be model veteran
Buried in merit badges
I'm stuck in the center and could care less
About the eye of the storm and its monstrous measurements
I got a defense that I call coolin' with my brethren
Sometimes I get wet
But it's better than risking life and limb to me, don't you agree?

I built the city out one brick
It had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I stole the brick back and migrated east, now, let's build

Every tenderfoot cadet bettered slit-throat percentages
Chicken penmanship tied the thirteenth knot (Hangman)
I arrange panoramics of a placid cataloguing where wild dogs sing tailor-made lullabies tried by my offspring
I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes
And she'll bring the cadavers set 'em free and let 'em feed
The deviltry penciled me in, but I slept thick through my alarm clock
Silly Billy hid in the barn while farmer charmed the crops
And I'm a warden
My tongue is full of glass
Because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle
If he truly drank the poison
I'm alienating the mating dance of the higher, ire-based, tired-faced, miser-made God clones
We can manufacture medicine
Patent the five digit slide clock the essentials in (I'll be a bill collector)
My destiny's resting with red worms chewin' off the carcass anyway
Let me slay artists for tips in the penny tray
By the way if that diamond ring don't shine
That's cause I bought it at the five-and-dime but don't neglect the sentiment
I'll pedal my tricycle through the F-5 logistics of a twister
Soaked in the religions of a nit-picker

Now when a page becomes a squire, be engaged, clap your wings
When a noble's demoted hope it don't sucker-punch the colony
But when the catapult releases lease your claims behind the bunker
And fasten stinger pageant results to the public eye (Glory hunter)
Is it genuine enough to feel, baby felon?
Negotiate comradery or wilt

Purged urgent with dirty dominion monitor boxes
Hovering inches 'bove pertinent urchin toxins

I got this slicky sycamore handshake
That mimics digit splinter entry
Thereby filtering citizens tin man prior to axe descending (Tight)
Cats know the ambiance, calm beyond comparison
Captain passive spring loaded serenity

Shovin' one-way pins in subway systems
Standing up where I'm landing', now that a runway victim (Push, push)
Nature's gone batty, spreading spore legitimate
Slice the bishop, sever the ties, splinter the kinship
See every now and again I love life but hate to admit it
Cause it spreads the jinx upon a sleeping cynic

From one overlooked scene including loopholes
When Christ studies the return ramifications
I'll burn the campus to impress him
Then rock like Medusa glances
Who ran the final mile before the blanks blown?
Home alone sipping beetle juice
Just to numb it, then shimmy the needles loose
I built a castle out of fifty-two cards
Plus jokers, wit, and image
Modern theory charges while remaining harnessed to the vintage
I'm valid hypothesis honoring Occam's Razor
With a seam sewn via fatigued knuckle work (Labor)
I've patched the little leakage in the shell around my greed
In case Tommy Turbulence located The Matrix that impedes
Whistle me a dirge, falcon boogie burst classic
Bastard repellent fell in haunted machines screened by similars
Got beckoned like a suicide king to the dagger surface
Due to one queen who lodged her faith inside a broken circus
Me and my stargazers from the woodwork serve the furnace
Omit the discoloring on the lung then stung the serpents
I cherish the Ferris wheel's revolutions
It's not because the ride enthralls
More simply to the fact that it still revolves
Nursed in a bracket of televis, plastics and saccharin (well)
I oppose mass panic
Thoroughbred fantasy cadets pose with a latch key demeanor
Returning to find a home vacant with no similars to compare days with

Fantasy, murder scape bent perspective
Fuck a sore channel changed digit
I sit with a nasty network intravenous plan
With a stable diet of my cable pirate
Yo, the doctor is in, the doctor is on
Born the bastard son of static radiance cloned to welcome in every home
Lead a blue screen, bruised dream canopy
Victim of the cursed nursed Technicolor drunk support team
Ooh, I love all advertisements
Though accused by robot news casters who capture and pollute
Spoon fed hazardous fog to joy luck catholic squad
Please take me, please calm me, please make me a zombie
Please I want to donate my brain to the monstrous Panasonic profit
Now, twenty first century plagued
Dispersed to wide eyed glamour addict patients
Telecast patrons
Blue be the propaganda banners, well, sure I'll be a Marine
With a clean sword and blue uniform, it only takes a dollar and a dream
And I abide great idiot box power supply, fuzz vapor
Black out of New York, hey honey, get the generator
I'm in a doom, doom generation, pacin', ancient electric secret
Never sleepin' to miss the AM oasis
My name is a wired heart, sloppy obligation
Turn my stilt into my guilt and have a chatter box blame frame adjacent station
Make reality scrambled and suck the life out of a hidden vandal
And loving every minute of the gimmick, change the channel

But the children seem to love it
Yes mother, me and wild discovery
And heard the static flock to where I sleep
By the glow of that magic box big speaker
Stereo mastered often kill the freak seekers, eyes spiraling
Tangled in the star spangled wiring

And all the kings horses abort the loyalty to royalty
Fuck the fortress
Riddle me with glee, hoist the end all teleprompter above my sleeping head
I'll be dead by morning anyway

To feel the magnetic seal picket censorship

I wanna shop from my bed and set an

With allegiance pledged beyond the glass surface

Just let me hold the controller and I won't have to murder you
Plug it in, turn it on, let my little eyes glaze
Twenty screens lined up along the borders of the maze
I wanna see the five day forecast, fourteen days in advance
So I can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance
Plug it in, turn it on, silent flicks better than nothing
Let a once divine soul feel the functions of the hypnotist
The viciousness, ridiculous, peaking a dummy's interest
Touch the power button meet your maker, ain't that something?
Plug it in, turn it on, say goodbye to Sunday afternoon
Fix the antenna, sit back and let disaster bloom
It's a beautiful sight, with a most ugly intention
But I taste it everyday and bathe inside the consequences
Plug it in, turn it on, never once have you talked back to me
Your majesty, I love you, I despise you

January, I fell to the cobblestone
In April, I cut little paper flowers
In August, I drank cold tea all my lonesome
In October, I was introduced as coward
I love New York Saturdays
But Mondays last longer
And since I plan to live a long life
Maybe I'll serve a thousand Mondays and swallow the burn
To merge the week for all its got
To give my shoddy rotten ribs (thick forgot my ribs)
I got a lil' something called a spirit crisis on my skull
And it's nothing short of ferocious but I swallowed the dosage
I got a mantle, and the mantle is a candle
And my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day Gretel met Hansel
Then I settle in a stand still
I live forever reaching for the sun
Hoping some lucky day I'll clutch and get a handful
Rope ladder, I'm a swinging anvil
And I wanna turn skullies and tummies with pretty lullaby, bye
The way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal
I never felt so damn young
But you don't look a day over zero
And you don't look a day in its eyes cuz it'll make you realize
The night is near so
Well then go, dream, I clean around the edges
I tidy up the tabletop, and lectured all the pledges
I never really knew the true definition of precious
Till my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave me the message
I'm a fully animated life tree
See the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song
Of I'm a fully animated life tree
With branches for the heavens to admire naturally

For the sake of better demeanor and such to bust, fucking fantastic
Every little step she takes breaks the chambers
In the chest, developed in the abomidable trouble
Settle for a cruel second, loud for an hour
Screamin to the beats to leave until my whole weekend turns sour
I ain't been around the world but I been around the block
I ain't seen everything but I seen enough to talk
I ain't a prophet, I ain't the Second Coming of Christ
I'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice
I wanna weave a web, I bought a set of knitting needles
Fiddling with a theme, dream solid
Paddle in the hole-in-the-bottom dingy to where the portraits astonish
You won't regret a single solitary step, I promise
Look, in a situation where a dragon guards the gate
I make a true spur of the moment grown decision
Which in turn allows me to be something normal

Hi, my name is Hazardous Tobacconist (Hi), hung on the brink
I purge a dirge and spit my lung in the sink
As for the product, well it's wrenched in a barren backward wasteland
Of shimmering moral tension adventuring to blossom pleasant

And ninety-nine dreams linked on the shooting gallery wall
But it's like, not a wave crash similar to last or next
Heckle me not already doctored by regrets

Belligerent fragments bond massive
Usher in the pixels 'til the image burn classic
Bliss in a barrel and motivation in a basket
Imma cast it out to sea and wait for my karma to grasp it

See, an iron butterfly will float if given good condition
But I'm still fishing the same worm from the same faulty position

With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
That's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots
As the truth hits your ears begin to cry
"Why Is It Like This!" Why the fuck do I care?
I don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear
City lights look like bright groups of fire flies
Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies
Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries
Spit sparks speak to the streets
The skid marks are replies
Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals
The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you)
As I walk out my door, step into the pollution

Physically the situation's hard to stop
I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks

This for the urchins allergic to they own stingers
This for the absurd verdict linkers
This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions

It goes heave ho. You never got the grit right. Bark fame but you never put the grit down
Hawk styles but you never got the grit right. Put the grit down. Grit right. Get down

This is a never dug disco. Spread feelers. Tonka zonk Gepetto bred beezers
Jeepers, gee wilikers, goshes galoshes, Christ, god almighty
They tore his limbs off kilter, still the hostage moshes slightly
Hung off the balcony by the skin off his doctor's psyche
He hopes it holds but knows the locusts kamikaze nightly
He woke, promoted bug-eat-face, insect chopper's biting
He's only bones by the time the ungodly body's sighted
He saw the puddle, full color hideous monster Viking
He used to survey if the vermin dined on others like him
He found the fucks indigenous to him and awfully feisty
He grew old awkward grinch and settled into bonkers nicely
I alert vital spider works to cultivate grit, ship the bulk grade shit
Herbie the love bug drugs pulsate whips
Tie in spite for commoner idiocy and good old-fashioned biblical plague
We move units off your pagan escapade
And it's pits to the peg legged
Make us eclipse cripple, so that pimp's limp, wheel chair basket bow when 15 minutes fizzles
Your flimsy frame marks hip-hop's second most tragic event
And will 'til Jam Master Jay's resurrection and second death
Thieves in the strobe deep freeze your pose
For the disease that grows underneath your toes
Holds up a reason y'alls gold never seems to glow
Now we can all breath slow once the fiend's exposed
It goes heave ho. You never got the grit right. Bark fame but you never put the grit down
Hawk styles but you never got the grit right. Put the grit down. Grit right. Get down3Embed

Electric charge comin' from the mainframe
I'm from where the phat beats stretch for mad blocks

My every little step set in a star
Retina scarred; tread in a sled of bedbugs got my dead head in a jar
Crazer camp stamp blank on the mug of settlers registered
Not protest nor approval regarding every morn futile
My experience with a spirit alignment interference
Assigns division from clearance to ample scrambling
Let's note the magnificence in the difference
Okay, see two canaries on the wire aspire
To separate lullabies both of which had me drifting
Every clan ghostly orphan scared stiff in the bliss
And list picking from the arrangement under burden
Bust, wallow in will to split the privilege cluster
Lackluster as if a journey choice grew on the nearest chuckle path-dispatch trouble
I've never seen the water so high in my poison life
Social conduct, twenty pace, about face, self destruct
I know the key locations, sharp enough to catch those subtle signs cause
Well, this here alley cat's been around the block a couple of times
Lifting every tin can, sifting every mess;
One man's trash, you know the rest, live it
Pitching a battered platform out of mass hysterics perished in the blizzard
When it's finished I plan to sit and observe the twister pivot
Sleep and sleep well; sleep with a sacred array of fevers
Wake as a pertinent version of a pipe dreamer
Y'all can find me if you lookin for a friend
I'll be the only iron-clad oracle in a city of tin
It's like that

I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit

Spare a match for the most distorted orchid in the patch
Assorted orphans coursed in a morbid orbit forward the traps
I make a tentative promise to flash frequent
The most sacred abrasive based in allegiance to the makeshift mason's secrets
Water basin leaking, plug it up
The simple triple ring performance shoveled subtle imperfection
I rung a life's worth of saturated costume gear over hell's balconies
To nullify the drought and still the martyr farmers shout at me
And so the epic went and every cirrus hung
The bow breakers turned a cradle fatal, every spirit clung
Croon for the slick Icarus brain children busy splitting the givingtree
Building fresh canoes for freaks to cross the spill in
I'm frantic
My plan is dwindling with every pulse bump
Gods and monsters yield the lump sum of the dolt clump
Be wary when the stratosphere tints
I scout like Atticus Finch, inching up slow in the games of reconnaissance
Now cause to amend the Zen memorandum has surfaced in every Holocaust citadel fix it plan
Twelve easy steps to better picket line demeanor

Stick stone conglomerate activate massive
But the sky is falling, fuck you

I'm twice born, once in 7-something
Once as the resurrection of honorable function
Been shoveling coal as the engine's doctor
Long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in the posture
The maintenance of icicle spirit by the warmth of true endearment
Was, is, and forever will be a luxury
I'm a sovereignty columnist fathering doom document
Curséd version of a certain Virgin Mary womb occupant

(Oh my Lord, what have I gotten myself into?
Seems like I woke up in yesterday again
Another day, another dream…)

I know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification
Sure as blurry mayhem had ‘em spent (Zen freeze)
Stuck until my friend leaves, puppet for the plummet committee
Sputtering bum, numb enough to stomach the city
Who’s that hugging the silhouetted willows where the hill’s crest pan out?
Barter candy-coated crab apples and sugar-dipped death hand outs
I got a plan, I'll tourniquet my quest
Then feed a needle in the bad ending to mute the mess
When patience gallops with absentee ballots, I shove in the button
Strutting to exhibit mankind’s hostility function with a (heave)
Paling in comparison to Matthias, Goliath
Lies the rickety frame of the wicked silence
I died the day my nameless creator and I bumped eyelids
Swear to Christ we saw the same thing for a second (What’s that?)
The grand mosaic depicting historical glory of the legend
Nursed me through the time stick-and-stone mixers hexed my fertile crescent
Now all's well, I'm laughing on the inside I swear
Just trying to keep my head above red tide despair
My imperfections pair off with buddy system symmetrics morbidly
So every second of discontent’s logged accordingly
Now let’s turn mummy subtle perfection to preserve glory condition
And pray for the day a starchild tugs the ribbon
Better land a two-hand grip on that spoonful-of-sugar medical chaser
Credible crazer antidote's terrible, taste her
Barter with a Stolen Soul Peddler, pigeon backed feather pen
Never said a grin implied health
Consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid blend of fabrics I deemed practical
Now is you is or is you ain’t compatible?
I feel the wind in my opinions
Plus hyper clutched to crush one’s gingerbread tenement awful
It’s like the day the great oak met the sawmill
A lifeline of spectacular expansion meets the reaper at the hand of one man’s tantrums
My friend’s got a book about dreams. I look and laugh
I dreamed a book about my friends and still can’t decipher the half
Chatterbox. Now let a soothsayer major cater to a kinked breed
Battered on the brink of disease
(Well) I am (skin and bones), I am (sin and poems), I am (tin and chrome)
Grin and groans, fuck it, I’m tinted quinacridone
Blow the petals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush
And felt as if I’d actually accomplished something
Fortify the bullies, let a joke soak in the treatment
Sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening
Caught a ghost up in the fuselage seconds before the cog dropped to the sticks
And stared him down until he fixed it
You might also likeOh, fashion? It’s cool and all, but what about God?
(Oh God? well he’s the man, but I mean, what about reading?)
What like novels? Man, that don’t hold my attention. How about television?
(Television hurts my brain. How about walking in the rain?)
Oh I hate walking. It’s boring. How about some old-fashioned gone fishin'?
(Yeah, fishing’s great, but I just hate hooking the bait. Let’s dance)
Nah, I got two left feet plus motion sickness. How about breakfast?
(Man I’m hungry, but that means I'mma have to borrow some money)
Let’s fly a kite. (Let’s burn the generals). Let’s sell lemonade. (Let’s drink)
Let’s poke a hole inside the tugboat, ease on back, and watch it sink
(Nah, let’s fail a pupil once a year at random to shake the academy)
Casually note the blossom of phantom alignment. (Strategy)

Well, I’ll make a waterfall out of water and autumn
Sorta caught ‘em when their guards mimicked the vintage knuckle drag sagged in the coffin
I affiliate my rag dummy appearance with a most cohesive spirit
Cried a river yesterday, ain’t shed a tear since
‘Gimmie gimmie’, crooned the Old Yeller community cartoon
The carousel ballooned extravagant. Aware
Inviting, yet I’m sworn to adamant manner and saddle in worn head, thorax, and abdomen
To primitive horseback galloping
My index finger’s dressed in my talisman
Branded up in the jackal skin, I spy mark of the product
Well, one must pardon ye old common sheep detour weaving graceful through the prime directive column
Pray the virus retreats to allotted phylum
Beanstalk with a fiend walk and my name is mud
But that’s got a ring to it, so my soil welcomes the flood
I walk as God’s practical joke on man, practically broke
And if they raise my rent again, I’ll spend my nights practically soaked
Who spit silk dimension through the noose looped by the rafters?
After lack of reasoning, dead ‘em. (It’s like "three, two, one, bedlam")
Ooh, I’m hung. I clung to hope, but see you in hell
I’ll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt
Sturdy iron grillage, tin can skeleton
Skull of a thousand dilapidated dream remnants
Here to convict based on a tin bucket of evidence
That stairway to heaven’s merely a legend so the peasants dream well
(Blesséd peasants, blesséd peasant dream well
Every blesséd peasant’s just trying to dream well…)2Embed
Yo change the fucking channel
I burn a Coma candle
When the flame fades, consider my flatline a soldier's sample
We them cats talking noise behind that New York trash heap
Where the stench of commuter briefcase replaces a bad sleep
And it's, worker zig-zagers versus piggy badge flashers
Training Generation Fallout
Waterfall bricklayer pincushion crawl out
There's smoke in my iris
But I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids
So I'm ready now (What you ready for?)
I'm ready for life in this city
And my wings have grown almost enough to lift me
I'm a dinosaur with Jones Beach in my hourglass
Passing the time with serial killer coloringbooks and bags of marbles
Don't tell me you ain't the droid that held the match to the charcoals
Don't tell me Lucifer and God don't carpool
(This is our school)
I'm not trying to graduate to life at the personalized barstool
Head in a jar on the desk, feet dangling in a shark pool
(Man please) Man please
My name stands for my being
And my being stands for the woman who stood
And braved the storm to raise the seedling
(Brother, sun, sister, moon, mother beautiful)
Yeah middle sibling suitable but far from son of excellence
Back in a long time ago, I was to way the wishes wish
But missers miss, I slept through my appointment
Saw the liquid dreams of a thousand babies solidify
And picked the rose that wilted
The second I introduced myself as Nervous
Well it appears the scars of learning have spoken
Some are burning, some have frozen
Some deserve tall tales, some wrote them
Some are just a brutal repercussion of devotion
Mine are all of the above cuz everything leads to erosion
Now where I live there's a homeless man, he sits upon a crate
He makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make
Now if you ever come and visit me, I suggest you watch the show
Tell him Aesop Rock sent ya just to hear his horn blow like this

And I ain't getting any younger
My knuckles wear their bruises well
I've yet to lose that hunger
But only time can tell
Prodigal Son with a prodigal wish to sew that prodigal stitch
And crucify bigot voodoo doll on two popsicle sticks
See your name is Ambiguity
My name is something hands can't hold
But hearts part ocean scapes just to watch the starlet unfold
It's like sketching a circle in the dirt with a pointed stick
Knowing the wind'll kill it some day, still it calls my burning wits for now
And if I plow the fields that don't guarantee plentiful harvest
But starving artists die, I set my alarm for five o'clock
Idols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing
The Bible's carp revivalist winos flock by the hundreds
To the opening, scarlet carpets greeting their duel
Leading the stubborn mule to cruel rugburn
But y'all numb from gut fuel
I administer eclipse, there ain't no motor like a martyr-made motor
Cuz a martyr-made motor don't quit
I am an epiphany, I am webbed foot mammal
Channel surfing my way to the top
Tugboat in a bottle
With no holes poked in the nozzle
I fed em bedlam diluted in limelight
Till that rookie boogie graduated hostile
And the vehicle is grandeur and it veered over the median
The second my halo ran outta helium
Demoted to thorn crown, damn talk about numbskull
I was born bound to a stencil called symmetry
But my energy's a rental
So I take this now to say
Thank you senorita for holding a flame to a lost wick
Thank you James Anthony for the band-aids on my ego
Y'all are family for life
I'll take that bullet to preserve you
I wanna be something spectacular
On the day the sun runs outta batteries
Attach my fashion to the casualties of anarchy
Save my nickels up to buy that homeless man a brand new horn
Then sit up on his crate as I witness the beauty born like this
(I ain't gettin' any younger)

I start my city with a brick (one brick)
Then add another brick (two bricks)
Brick by brick I manufacture homes for fallen angels
I ain't no great Samaritan, that's just the way the game goes
Respect the polars but acknowledge middle-value rainbows
My snout turned up from dream factory eyelids
Slinging bottled prosperity for the kamikaze colonels
Yeah rocks the match that burned his Nazi journals
And plotting verticals amidst blatantly horizontal
Models then swallowed by famished potholes
And I'm tired, tied up on these functions
Killer cotton candy clouds and huckleberry justice league
Another knuckle dragger dungeon breed
Run, breathe, sit, bellow
Wild Aes scream through your style to hear the echo
Aight then, flinch for the great granddaddy payback
When Little Billy bought a tugboat
Now he thinks he's Captain Ahab
Fascist, it takes more than peg legs, birds and eye patches
Learn that lesson you'll be swashbuckling with the best of them
Wonder why you wept over spilled milk and got your crayons wet
The room reeks of a thousand bayonets
I'll fission vision with a lie longer than your most walked meridian
Connecting life with that little species of idiots
We've now officially scraped barrel bottom
Aesop Rock, an apple to the core but y'all ignored him
I know a planet made of porcelain
And once I get tired of holding this gavel up
Y'all prayer circles met him up born again
I ain't too good for tap water
Play taps out of order for a ballad, corpse a dead man walking
You can lead a man to a city, but that don't assure civility
You can beat a man to death with Aesop Rock bootleg CD's (That's more fun anyway)
Some cats float, some cats don't
I speak in Fahrenheit and burn off coal and lyric
Diss blatant harassment, spit honor, whistle fearless
Don't dismiss the billy goat appearance for that common sheep

Platforms have been erected
Effigies built
Slogans coined, songs have been written
Rumors have been circulated

The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
Moving boxes have been worn out
Mantelpieces dusted
Idols idolized, the sands have been shifted
Curtains have been closed
Sleepers all waked
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape

Now with my trusty paperclip
I pick locks of thoughts vault
Finding the garden barren
The harvest fruitless
Only the tree of life flourishing
Wanting to take a bite but I'm toothless
Is that predestination or is it by design?
That I'm trapped in time sand
Show radio mission control but for my rhymes
Man because I can like aluminium
And I recycle my consciousness
This is just a note
For any action or lack thereof there's a consequence
Wingless angels
Stroll a top shapeless cotton balls
With halos in your syringe
Celestial ground is found, broken
Exposing a bottomless depth where heartless spines awake to devour the small piece of your soul that's left
You're immersed in sound, floating
Aimless destination
Drop anchor to gain stability
Stare out potions, restrain fertility
Pedestal talk is a token soaked in pockets where lives' topics lack conceptual, ridicule
The night breathes, but light's choking
Darkness occupies the throne where poems are persecuted
The purity at time diluted
Rhymes are executed for genre, I'm told
When has beens attempt to cause heat to rise and wonder why they're trapped in cold
Life's an origami box and I'm hidden within the fold
So when the yarn unravels I won't be caught by surprise
And as society's fabric of orthodoxies dismantle I'll see you embracing the pentagram within this crucifix disguise
See, when the canvas stands before me I'm compelled to spill a vision
For the sinners that listen: I got three spikes and a thorn crown
It seems I need a new soul because mine is worn down
But from the pregnancy of my hardship was born style
Still my pen bleeds and stains the paper with thought
Finding me lost among statues of mainstream idols
Drowning in melted ice, to reinforce that breath is vital
If your father and his father were fish out of water you must break the cycle
How many times must a plant be uprooted, for it to die?
When it's smothered with lies that abolish the potency of the sky
So when the stars burn out and God replaces the bulbs with a million watts
And throws the switch, sparks filament
Herding blue giants and flocks
I stand on my own two, aura illuminated in red
Showcasing the agony held within this welded spirit
Sacrificing itself for the health of a masochistic culture
Yearning for the truth that we speak, but refuse to hear it

Mach force, blind the extorted style from the common dirty

Only to mostly over cook the specimen
Vending tragic fatality successful dodging volleys
All Hail Mary's and Hello Dolly's!

Who holds the fifth golden ticket?
Tour the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets
The house next door to when the stickball clears the fence
Y'all hesitate to fetch it!
I was walking through a pinball tilt built landscape
Pterodactyl circling turtle
I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow
Suck and rust the oxygen gulps
And spit the metal directly back up the barrel
We ice grill the silhouettes (right)
The common decency factors a lowball estimate of zero
My testament is striking B-Boy stances
Dancing past the foggy mirror
When wiped clean, the billy goat beard camouflage the spirit
I'm at six degrees of sexy sarcasm
Yeah, never swam up inside Summer Jam classic

Dirty doc stellar space medic
Stoned by the commoners for glowing
Psuedo floaters buy them beats till bloated
Happy trail hitchhikers guide to spanning oblivion
Complete with a thankless 9-5 chapter
You can sign your life after the fact
Wicked soldiers pickin with buddy system
Logistic motors like Noah's ark ticket holders, pivot
All in a days breath
I guess
Sandman here to foreshadow a day when television run over baboon heart transplants
Sketching a glass partially empty till their hand cramps
With an iceman's chance in Dante's dreamland to stand where the fans lamp
But maybe I do
Yeah yeah maybe it's all over
Maybe I won the game before the machine ate my quarter
I mean absorbing attention's a must
You don't wanna be overlooked
Yeah but you don't wanna be looked over too much
One up for the dashed hopes of fifty fishermen who crashed boats
And the angels who never hit bad notes when harmonizing
I'm an armor-plated farmer
I'm an archer rising with a drawn bow
For the karma where the bulls eye clings and argues
Dense, spreads like new names at the writers bench
Either you drink it or sink it, coz there ain't no sitting on the fence
You make me chuckle child, it's Hell's kitchen now, miss
Recognize your life is merely bait for bigger fish
I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel
Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle
I'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle
I don't budge the motives
Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas
I don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel
Loving the consequence of uprooting the jungle

Yo, ask her
Hey, Lucy, come here
Lucy, how old are you?
Lucy, come here
Lucy
Hey, Lucy, how old are you?
Lucy!

Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was Joshua, age 10, bully of the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler
On her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor
And she drew
Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew
Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passersby
They'd ask her why she passed her time
Attaching lines to concrete, but she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
"Hey, little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?"
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
"I'm busy, thank you much"
Well, well, one year passed and believe it or not
She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk
And she stopped-
"Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today?"
She said:
"I'm not giving in, I'm finished," and walked away

Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
And she drew
Little Bobby who would come to sweep the porch
And she drew
The mailman, delivered everyday at 4
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
But found it suitable, and she liked it that way
She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on Saturdays to share the pictures that they drew (Look!)
Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
Just one of the neighbors
Acting nice although she was a strange girl, really
Say, "Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?"
Lucy would smile and say "I'm busy, thank you much"
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
And Lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
'Cause while they spread their rumors through the street
She'd paint another masterpiece
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, 'cause dreamers always chase but never get it

A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, 'cause dreamers always chase but never get it

Lucy was 87, upon her death bed
At the senior home, where she had previously checked in
Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest
Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen
And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn
Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
Lucy pinned up a life's worth of pictures on the wall
And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all
No Rico, he had passed about 5 years back
So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock of nothing
She'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside
And she said:
"Look, I've never had a dream in my life
Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued
I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!"
Well! The nurse jumped back
She'd never heard Lucy even talk
Especially words like that
She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind
Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures
And she died
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, 'cause dreamers always chase but never get it

I can walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete
People are made of match sticks, life is bred of flames
Noted the craft work bore the last smirk of the Damien mainframe
My boxcar siphons third rail juice from lost poets
Inhabit ocean bottom with a bin of rotten scapegoat pardons Note to self:
Don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies
Where participants squeeze in last giggle then widdle sacrificial finales
I can tie my bootlaces alone, save the knee deep offerings
Sorta brings you coughing bunk persona to light
I might, Build anti-malignant railroads, find you, and lay tracks adjacent
Just to scream "fuck off" as the engine pulls out the station
What should we do with a thousand drunken sailors?
"Kill 'em all, locate their family address, release a mailer:"
(Dear Sir or Madame, your son or daughter's embarrassed humankind
Consuming booze and gut-fuel, till their cruise had crossed the line)
I spin gold
He bats a dirty lash toward the nursery class act impressionable bubble
(Y'all could've been more subtle when polluting paradise gene puddle)
Man, huddles make us look like cool peeps and I'm trying to school sheep

I leave footprints in fours, two for bipeds, two more to break the door
You can practically caress the utterings of crushed by drudgery
Brothers and sisters mothering stickler cabinet, mad and shit
I'll fix your wing for a penny and a parable
Yeah, but this friendship sunk with a barrel full of tarots pulled
Snake eyes harbor bad shiners
Then wonder why the cauldron sitting at the their rainbows ending
Rocks garbage bag liners (garbage bag liners)
I sat to breathe. Adam and Even without the Apple seed's useless
(I sat to breathe) Bashful boredom crafts a castle out of toothpicks
(I sat to breathe) I breathed too hard nearly, metamorph castle loose pins
Now I stand to breath as not to disturb the plumage
And I know that sob story, it no longer turns my stomach
Hollering wolf in the form of one frustrated culprit
Caught a love tap full of washed up stardom, melted trying to milk it
Win a ticket to ride white lines highway sideways knelt it, smelt it
One love to the rungs in my ladder, one love to the gathering of
Laughter baths that hung from my rafters
See the jackal met the badger, they were both such fucking bad asses
That clashing wouldn't make sense (hence my tape deck)
Now I ain't gonna name names, and I ain't gonna drag others in
But I ain't about to say that I'm the only catch you got bubbling
You're lucky, somehow you've managed to befriend some good people
Who will sit and soak the evils you secrete, but why? I'm not really sure
(Knock knock. Fuck off. Kicking his lip across the floor
'til the archival vinyl venom soak the lure
Anti-clarity mechanism spit flattery burners
Fusing a million majesty murders, then stole your crown)
Oh wait, that's right, you discovered me right?
Offered up the peace pipe
Then oh, it's all cotton candy when Aesop rocked a b-line
He's acting foolish left in the middle of laying bricks
(but we weren't building nothing but a great wall around these stones and sticks)
Oh and for the record I've been rhyming since me and Andre thought we could freestyle
Built foundation out passion and brother's dusty Tascam
Studied dope rappers, vocab expansion, poems, syllable placement
You just mad because somewhere in there you came and went
(And I ain't the type to dwell) Dismissed it as casually non-compatible and bounced
Obtained status where I could straight objectively critique your after projects like
'Oh that sounds fresh' or 'Damn that shit is garbage, what happened? I'm not even laughing'
Yeah, but the barriers were broken (you choked)
You choked a few comments to the wrong Vulcan who out of respect and honor leaked your program
Now like were, both trying to sit and breathe another dawn so my advice

Raw, I'mma give it to ya, no trivia
Raw like that Aesop rock iron-fisted bliss militia
A bent funny bone, drone community
Spit a thousand and one ripples to cripple the continuity
Tapwater builds character. Right
I irrigate it straight to mainline
You want to do the same? Fine
These pretty profit grommet teams solidify to clot the slippery city sump piston pump drain
Behold "Old King Credible". Kind soul with a Russian-roulette bad mood spin-off
Where every day, a thousand strangers pray for empty chambers
One sixth buckle
Five sixths sweat bullets trying to keep it subtle
But I'll get you (I'mma get at you)
My novelty, wobbly rope bridge broke inches prior to dry land
But duck skull stepping-stones suit the mix down well
Well, when the rumor spreads that y'all stupid
I'll be the cat with guilty look on face and shirt that reads, "I didn't do it"
God, is it on? Is it beyond basic?
Does it ice-grill you? Or is every song faceless?
Does it have a title? If it didn't would you name it?
Does it babble about nothing like a drunk atheist?
We could run that Orwell's '84 warp for the Room 101 detour
Until each client fidgets with his or her own worst fear specifics
Swerve around the cobra kisses
See if the venom overloads this vision, I'mma suck the poison out and spit it
Stole my sneakers but your feet just never fit in
Serves you right for trying to walk a mile outside your limits
I'mma tiptoe across this yo-yo string
Until you walk the dog out from under my feet and skip town, sit down

Earth to A.R. vertical
Burden has increased at an alarming rate
Bliss is down a point, murder up, glee down, and still falling
Still crawling out of bed at 2 on Saturdays came this blind soldier-burning confessional
Ease back, let a heart thump echo normalcy for 10
Let the back burner boiling point descend
I race the derby in the first heat (strike personal)
Strike personal space with a most utterly putrid version of grace
Spit the gimmick, sit and fidget wild
In five you'll be jumping through hoops like Coney Island freak show midgets
Want to be a fighter pilot?
Driving that childish early Wright Brothers experiment prototypic model fossil
Sitting sweating bullets on a console
Busting accidental dirt bike donuts outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo
Dead before the chubby debutante conquered the high note
Schooled by the cruel intention invention's pensive sideshow
See contrary to popular certainty, I alone advance
Without an earthly poem, and dance on a handful of zoning fans
Combing every chance to own the land, I roam with dome in hand
And truly be its only camper happy with the scrap heap
See I convince myself it's on, therefore it is
And the melody settles beneath the fact that I'm just spitting for these kids
I tried to get 'em all open, and once I quit and said I didn't care
That's when they all threw their hands in the air

In the beginning it was Large Marge sent me, I'm bent
Empty the rent if you can double park the garbage barge gently
The moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house
And Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out
Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma
Clouds, Solar boy elope with couch ogling older Polaroids
Motor mouth, chauffeur the golden molar toy
Gophers yoke a fish out of water, he grows lungs and multiplies
Idle when soldering a perfect union
It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends
So if mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance
The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps
Maroon the traitors expecting acres of edelweiss
Who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives
I show up late looking project grizzly
Two bowies, a third for throwing and accomplish dickweed
Nothing, nada, nill, I stuff a lot of pill to gut
What's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks?
I'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood
But if I'm not! (Hmm?)
Fuck it, plug him, warpy got his goddamned groove back
Jet-setting on spec with a dead yeti on the roof rack
And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia
Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation
And I walk like early man, freak a little witch hunt
Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma
The malformed oddities among sovereignty's normal
Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you

Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow
Authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone
All the town sickly know the Coke machine as home
Where they sit and hope the Ovaltine that noble's drink is strong
Couples only roller rink with soul to kiss your chicken noodle
Before they wiggle mittens through the pillory to ridicule
And you can hear the iron maidens lock
Or see the town criers ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck
A is up early, ring and run thank you much
Document a little of that underbelly bang for buck
Hey I walk as the hype of the city gossip
Meaning every dumpster diver's gotta vomit up a comment like
Um you ain't shit, this ain't ill
This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still
This a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build
Cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell
Babylon goggles, gawk for the galvatron coppers
Tugboat salvage all fossils
I'll be shepherd when the whirlybirds deny the lepers doctors

When the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you
You will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose

Jiggy-jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages
When bible page verse tidal waves begun (Water won)
I wrote the book that shook America to splinters
In a winter wasteland icicle-bound barren township
Call Baron Münchhausen and proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig
Delinquent sinking like a paper tugboat well beneath your holidays
Beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty
I'm a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag
It's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels
To the Riverside Park Tunnel people claim last lifeform standing
Carbon based pardons ain't enough
My stilts truly personify this urbanite flea circus
We urchins merkin on daily
I catapult brain opera past basic
Tear my own face off in the finale, stick around it's ill
Diabolic Prodigal Son spill grimace
If you had one more eye, you'd be a Cyclops
Which explains missing the premise
Bliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh, die
Kiss the finish, piss the villagers the fuck off
Pete Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
Aes Rock might've smoked one too many dimes in his time
Now, where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother?
Probably gathering your sheep with all these other motherfuckers
Struck twice in the same place by a moody Zeus fishliner
Smackin the third clear out the park
Going gone (To infinity and beyond!)
I rocked for a flock of Chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers
Hermit crabs and New York city sewer aligators
Keep your Honalee dreams out your homily
I deal with tangible goods
And avoid manufacturing food for landfills
I've seen friends bow to needles
I've seen needles bow to records
I've seen boughs break
I've seen God bow and make the clouds shake
I've seen the proud break
I've seen a lot for a blind soldier
Who tattooed a cityscape on skin to blend in
The rats travel by night and fight the waterbugs
I'm here to pull the three-prong on this prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice
Add a hatchet slice for kicks
And so that God-awful Frankenstein scar on your style can someday be a story for my kids
Life's hard, life's easy
Life's everything in between
Life's Peachy like James and the Giant
And I keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it
And I keep casting my line as long as these fish will bite it
And I like it (Don't try it like that)

Bantamweight temper tantrum, decrepit anthem
Set a low goal, I arrive late
I'm here to scrape a cog clean till the funk machine
Imposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother
(Oh you got heart?)
I hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates
Like these here drunken little archers miss more than they calculate
The falcon hates the mockingbird
The farmer hates the drought
I hate em all, I kick the bottom brick out shouting "Yes y'all"
And blow the village out perspective (Aesop!)
Do you take this makeshift Candy Land cult-classic bastard style
To be your lawfully wedded head trip
To embrace throughout sickness, health, electrical storm
Fire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow? (Hell no!)

I stood before the glittery borders of new radius
In search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet
What I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment
Meets the lust for blood and demerits

Cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky
Collar-pop Jolly Roger die motherfucker die
Apache on a ship shape, in Bristol fashion
Snuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him
Worm teeth grinding feverishly below
As little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow
So when it's Blackhawk over the glass walk
They surface up through the cash crops
With clippers for your belly-up mascots and never dine alone
Meanwhile, back at sea level, it was home by home zone for zone
Bloom County's homeless riot for home ownership
I hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads
I studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb
As opposed to the loaded nose who pray Armageddon is numb
And that's unevenly rendered
To those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason
But not a reason to surrender
Catch the Liberty Fire's catalog
Forty torched orchids and citronella for Algernon

Nothing says charm like an armored car
Taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar
We were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts
And march through the gauntlet of car alarms
No harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier
Than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears
But we can run with scissors through the city fair
Or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs
Double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark
Where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy Clarks
These are the vices of the p-noid bastards
Who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest
But crews lose lunches by the hundreds
Lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing
Humming keep your mouth closed
Keep your cows cloned, go
I am the pulse of this fucking town homes know
My what a convenient embargo
At least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from
The too-far-gone kicks, still in the box
Fix, still in the pill in his sock
Chilling, gill in the slop and a million watch Gideon scribes
But once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide
And that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish
While profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes

The mobile infantry is so postal
Coast into the quotient provoking the local Pistol Pete
Choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens
Smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies
Dopey, no surrender, bender in effect
Sole defenders of the longest night New York had never slept
And there were jumping jacks and whistlers over Christmas
Like Rockets From The Crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference
I step in Hog Heaven, stony, with no weapons
Pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers
Who broadcast eighty million versions of the sermon
For that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains
Pale, Arcadian moon, high-definition, flat plasma
IMAX, city-wide transfer
Artificial Einstein-Rosen out the tenement
Ease into the Xanadu, let it hammer the tension out
I'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal
Monitor face to the wall opposite
U.F.O.'s and locusts sing the same old song
While the Weathermen get retarded as the day is long

Swinging a paddle at mental patients
Raping the competition to smother the pain and sin
So he pound you out in table tennis like Wang Liqin
Too strange within just to stop
Demented interactions sleep and thoughts documented
He's lingering insane paint thinner in his vein
Colors blown out around the doctor's finger in his brain
With a needle unable to beat him in a fetal position
He crafted a path to escape his condition
Would cling to the white walls of psych halls
In his mind soon bled the words he would speak to the world in time
But not before more injections strapped to the bed

When his wrists released, he wrote tunes you could snoop through

High noon calls and the walls own him

Before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops
High noon was your basic who's who of brutal truth
Hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance
Turn a young'n to a dozen paper dolls holding hands
And tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch
So chicanery was yours to engage or ignore
I was on the latter, but a lot adopt pawns
So we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) Brawl fair, cop car
Voyeur hawk him out his hinges, storm door splinters
Clamoring about, hammers out about to ring
Infiltrate each others tribes and murder each others queens
Packed to the very last rafter
Clung to the rafts and the cameras to capture the damage
Neck swivel with a chop chop volley
Where the ants leave nothing, but the bones and the car keys
Pardon if his two feet fester, it was rude of me people, meet left and lefter
Planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector
But never got his extra extra
Peace for the better but it wasn't entertaining
So they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven
Like bees to the honey when they lumped you up
Cause bumper cars are only funny when they bump
Know that...

Yeah man that's my boy Steve; he just talks like that, it's weird
That is weird.)

Tune to "Hellemundo" for action packed blasphemy
Big city translate your face til it atrophy
I let the schadenfreude boy out actually
Deployed to void with grin to watch laughingly
(Yeah bitch) Pass the P's it's a laugh in
I can smell the tragedy when hatchin'
Happily dispassionately patched in
Alive with the menace of demise
Like, "Yes!" the pain dazzles men, pass the popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) It's reality at it's fastest
And yet it still unravels at a pace like molasses
I guess the last of the seconds before the worst of disasters stretch past us
Wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous?
In the corridors of entropous wars contort drastically tilted fits
I adjust to climates of the wilderness
Walk along my spine take the pilgrimage
Up in to the section that's reserved for the smirk of the coldest witnesses
Work you motherfuckers (hooray!), there's all day to die
Innovate the mayhem with grace
The good-form-fall, fuck if I'mma warn y'all, nah
I got the front row to the greatest entertainment that an angel never saw
Sixty thousand watts of that raw
"Pull the claw out of the trunk" fun, each one teach one how to club one
Look at how they bathe up in the dove blood
It's gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of mud mud...
Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn, popcorn...
Each one teach one how to club one- popcorn... wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous?
(Yo honestly, if your man Steve really talks like that... uh, that's not really normal...
Yeah, that sucks... Yeah, it's pretty bad...
Nobody's voice should sound like that.)

It was a lazy day, it was amazing grace
It was a half-a-dozen claymores daisy-chained
It wasn't daisies and crazy
Eights, it was an ace of spades over a waiting game of slaves
And saints, and every trainee face-painted while his great
Escape grazed and ate
He'll never make it, when he aims he shakes
And I was overly engrossed from a very locked door
With a couple milk duds and buckets of popcorn
(Pass the popcorn) Clap clap, encore, monkey in the middle study
How the bunker took the missiles, age of machines with nary a green
Screen, so the hecatomb is every bit as cutty as it seems
I could tell the pet from the vet, money where his canine's spread
And never welched on a bet, that said, know the over-under
On your local hunter and you'll profit off his widow-maker's
Numbers every summer, bump in the night, funny, will he catch and release 'em?
Has he mercy, will he hack 'em to pieces?
Is he dirty, will he hassle policeman and security breach until impurities leak over the circuitry?
And nada milk and honey there is only skulls and bunnies
That hop around drunk in the land of a hundred Mondays
God damn, pop the Redenbacher proper and
For Christ's sake get this man a doctor!2Embed
Take-take the medicine, tastes great
Got the key to the city, I’m wake-baked
Way before the media shitting or 12 zip of ganked paint
The origin of a thievery leader will take place
Two coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler
Grapple a refrigerator, gaffle a Nilla Wafer
And no role model provoke him to shift focus
Cause he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it's stolen
Kids got the darnedest quirks
So 11's arms skip jars for his momma's purse
And bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn
Which he kept in a box in the yard
And the bark isn't carved from a klepto-anthem
But a klepto-tangent prefaced the grand canvas
Dance to the dirge, stand up
Celebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned
See it rolls off the tongue
Like a smoke ring rolls off a lung 'til it's done
Ready, set, kept petty theft on a post-it
Later apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit
"Hey, you with the sharpie and BM!"
Did you foreplay the GM, or you carpe the diem?
Whore play the porn game, fornicate the sure way to freedom
Or correlate with the swordplay and heathens?
Trickery and backtalk, fresh outta high school
On the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule
Every last number in its history
Got is own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory
Thanks, bathe in a bottle of your finest
Tackleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds
Before the hell appears to put the chemi in the climate

Larceny's yes-men ooze for used weapons

Is dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing
Nope, gotta configure the five finger
So the hot-wired vehicular skill is applicable
If an eye's on the prize and the itch ain't flushed
I hope the fruits of your labor outlive the initial rush, like
Step on the abysmal cusp
With matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fuck
Then incubate the mutt baby through his stigma's crutch
Like he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums
And this is certified milk by the New York Department of Skullduggery
Shoplift quicker than your shutter speed, click!
Missed, he dipped with dumb cutlery
In and out of muddy river water 'til the rudder bleed
Skip around the money pillar, color me bunny killer
Hovering where the mother feed, gutter greed king
And a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me
It go knock knock rummy at a bruckner speed
The seed's all growns up playing grown people games
Evil aims grown, encompass the whole steeple chase
Grip, mitigate the master plan
So when the workers are asleep, riffraff expands
Yes a pig is a cop, but gotta fill up the flock
So when I rake in the bacon I hope the kiddies'll watch
I hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked
Cause opportunity's fickle, after it trickle it stop
Capture the flag, drag that crass little bastard
Flat through the hazmat and glass
Laugh when he ask for it back; scratch that:

Good evening
All right
Yeah
Happy to be breathing
Yeah
I am alive
Yeah
Yeah

"You look like you've seen a ghost"

Are you asleep? Or are you
Are you awake? Nah, man, I'm done
I'm showered, I'm everything
Ate some fuckin' Lucky Charms
Let's go

Most copious, rains soaked the opiates
Notice how the phobias appropriately procreate
Woke up with a ghost farm, focused on his groceries
When they aren't telling stories, they are multiplying grossly
On the lawn, let 'em loiter, never let 'em spawn
The apparitions have been drinking his water for too long
So when they gathered by the birdbath in the morning, he would tell 'em
"I mean no disrespect but you have all outstayed your welcome"
Interesting in a sense
Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence
How quickly they will lift their heads
And breathe an ultimatum like the dead don't argue
Said, "You're living by the bayonet (but how alive are you?)"
Shit, A is all juice and bad etiquette
Elbows on the table, lobster bibbin' on the ready set
He said, "But how alive?", I dunno, homie, you decide
(No, you decide) Fine! How alive? Too alive
(How alive?) Too alive (How alive?) Too alive
And one by one around the yard 'til each one felt communal pride
Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public
With a steaming plate of justice for them Easy Baker stomachs (Say what?)
We the legends that hunt with the unremembered
Geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor
Who snuck around the art police and all related governments
To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip
Ahh, money's in the market for a mothership
To double as a vessel that drag his legacy under it
And who am I to hang him out to dry by the heat
When, if rehydrating fails, we're all dumber because of me?
Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
The "Too alive" channel from the library of rivalry
And summers in the mud (Mud), winters by the tracks (Tracks)
No story goes untold, Aes is back

Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a "v"
Smores over warm helvetica brown proper
For the odd God or monster, propped to teleprompter
Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel
Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia
Usually the shooter community chew the corpse
But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours
Day of the dead, play the ledge closely
Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
Dope the gonzo I've always felt choked socially
Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies
Earth rised, divided by fighting tribes
All we do is watch 'em waddle back and forth lighting fires
{Money money}
Detonator, wire cutter, pliers
Two cities enter, one is broken up in tiny tiles
And I wonʼt pose arm in the heart of the lionʼs throat
For a photographic token of my primordial growth
You parade around and kill, so damn proud
Like a flatline fetish, had it's feathers fanned out
War taught him symmetry, skipped into it gingerly
Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry
Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows

Money is cool, I'm only human
But they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded
Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is
Bullets don't take bribes stupid, they shoot shit
(Another dark night)
Calicos tread around the rabbit hole
Weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grows
Piss warm sugar water, what a summer canteen
Plus burned rubber like "green is the new green"
Rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex
Rodeo commotion, I'm open to see what culminates
Bougie on the right, left rep rebel force
Both say the feud will prove the parking lot was never yours
Black top pebble wars
Soldiers molded where the jonesʼs every grown-up
Wants decoded came to grow in
No motive, it showed up in gross quotas
Hog barn burner come see if your homes hold us
Eighty-five rattle-trap parked and fancy
You could swear he was stepping out of Comanche, antsy
Let us in the jetty when they jettison the medicine
And paranormal hatchet and cadets to break the levees in

Both know the totem camaraderie
Token of equality, they post it horizontally
Crown the golden loading dock, they crawl to lodge the colony
Half-mast flags, half cabs loiter properly
And sleep the sleep of the just ready on the left
Where the witchcraft spun out of a neighboring sect
With the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters
On the day your name became "This Motherfucker?"

For want of a shoe the horse was lost
For want of a horse the rider was lost
For want of a rider the battle was lost
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost
And all for the want of a horseshoe nail
There is a hole in front of the shovel
Shovel in front of the brawn
Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
Each within his mulish days to choose his tool of trade
Dueling blades that cued a cruel charade and fuel the flames
Few would clue the crew into the civil
Skip the food and land like you the man
Who flew the coop over the pitbulls
Dash back flashy to compassionate nanopolice who sat beneath an avalanche of jagged inadequacies
And I was "Stop the Violence" more than I was Pontius Pilate
Cops and robbers riot by the five's obnoxious sirens
A is gullible he figure, "all man equal, no brainer"
Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
Moms raised the babies through a very churchy 80's
Sunday mornings reinforce the waiting gates of Hades
And he brazen but apparently inferno bound now
For when a man of cloth recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunners deck
Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous
And you. observe and have the givetheth disproportionate
To the taketh away decide to maketh his day (do it)

Have clued into the suitor was capital to a beggar's hand
And uncomfortably. sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood in meat - umm, what?
Chinny chin-up and the city picked this
In a pent-up letter numbed the spitting stigma
Along came a spider, sold her eggs to any buyer
Now to shoot a ringer back with six legs wider than the driver
If you make no friends on the way to the top rung
There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck
But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your canons
All kings hang em for the cliffs side drip dry

If he live will he survive the milligrams of middle-ground
They pump into the pin-striped pentagrams over Tinsel-town
Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out
Or sickles, dipped in military hells bells and whistles

Breathin's a tug of war, wet when I rush the ball
Flushed, 29 bust gum stuck, clutch the door
Slumped in the back burn Bush by the son of George
Sweat tear and feed cause I don't bleed when I cut no more

A system of gods from each of the brawling tribes
So my bible is a pot of qualms, clipped and collaged
Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells
I don't speak the language but my last laughs held

Spiraled get vertigo, signals the flash and beep
Postin my head for myself to get back to me
Pouch full of dynamite, blast cap anatomy
Bags full of smelling salts

Monkey wrench in my hands, razor cut the islands off
Homemade taps-memories, I ignore the private calls
And ever since the 80's, I think something's in my Tylenols

What plague? Make an idolant brigade
So eager to walk planks, they will climb a tree and wait
Their irony is waning over piety and faith
So when the ghostly ruminations come, we'll kindly disobey it
I will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
Can't hold howls in corrals with a key
So will the worms please shriek on the count of three

Dead men tell no tales (Uh-huh)
Up push the daisies till the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale (Here we go)
Mr. Big sleep with the carp and kelp

Once upon a time in the days of yore
When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore
There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang
Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same
Peg leg navigate him starboard to port
By the nautical starry night yelling "The harbor is yours!"
And you should tell them where you situate the gold
That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy J-J-J-Jones
Like "walk the plank" for whom the shark thank
Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs
And while the shiny spoils piled higher every year
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer
Ten summers prior on a night like this
Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west
Swore it blew him a kiss
When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a
F-f-f-fish
"What the heck!" frazzled, his telescope shattered
Gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder
To deck circled the vessel 360 swiftly
Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey
Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar
He'll be the laughing stock of the Barbary Coast War
Like this dude either got two glass eyes
Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side
Now he knew what he saw
But had to prove he was raw
So he raped and he pillaged and
And he feud and he brawled
Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke
And vowed to always find her though he never told his cutthroats
(Hey!) Meanwhile, back in the now
Got a brand new skeleton crew on the move out
When they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow
They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth
Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease
Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed
And he was achy from his boots to the feather in his hat
Until his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map
One look down and lept off the dock
See if you can guess where X marked the spot
The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave
Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid
Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much
Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched
But see the vitamin deficiency was strong
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog
Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand
Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand
And nary a high tide so grand as the one that put
The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land
I wish I could tell you that it ended happy
Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water
No lie, scout's honor, got a million more
From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores
Before your visions of grandeur go to swell those sails

Proceed, snow-blind, 24 curfews

Raise up the bridge, lower the portcullis
Rain forks into mutton, no abort button
Core pump, assorted color sugar water
Poor lummox, unexplained ailments and doesn't work well with others
Wet nose on the glass, Garibaldi half cookie dough
Lock jaw, Don 4 walls like a wooden coat
Behold the rotting fruit of excommunication:
A ruby tide insubordinate to lunar phases
That maneuver past the beaches to the bosom of the pavement
Now the bow drill smolder in a flooded bit of basement
Grace of a misled teen who prefers his scenes with a little Wilhelm scream
The ambush predator edition
Skill set of Will Tell aim and speed over short distance
Part hatter-mad, part erratic habitat
Dark matter harnessing his heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack

Baseheads locally approach all spark plugs
Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump
Post-meridiem pretty tungsten attracts any once-pale horse painted gunmetal black
Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat
Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span
Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading
For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37
2000 out the weekly under "Cycles to Gehenna" gets him floating over 20 buses
Fireproof and festive
Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign
Knows no zen in the art of maintenance
Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby
Here is how a great escape goes when you can't take your dead friends names out your phone

Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

The man-ape translates glam thru the visor
Goes in water lillies
Am-scrays Giger, and man-ray
Crammed in a one-player campaign
Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain
Span where the praying hands mandate
Bars an extension of the arms
They're mutating instead of being farmed
Tonight beneath a marmalade Venus
Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us
Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus
All cones you can slalom when your Zorlac's focused
Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly
And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee
Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring
And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank Charlie
The scarf thank Mom's new hobby, kssssht! copy

It was less of an act of hubris
More a lonely hearts club at the helm of a magic bullet
Away on a relentless bid for rarefied inertia
Rattletrap forks married to the patchy terra firma Ursa Minor getting warmer
I crowbar into the pecking order
The dreck between the whores and Betty Ford-ers
Hug a double yellow spine
Knobby rubber like a rat on a rope
Those little fuckers run on passion alone
This is the product of a DIY inadequate home
Grabbing a cabin in the-fuck-outta-dodge
Actin' a savage in the shadows of Rome
Traffic amassed against insufferable odds
Fashioning gallows out of plastic and bone
I got the motordrome walls of death splintering under me
All-city galvanized bikes white knuckling
Bright light, tunnel kings tuck in the devil

Let me put you up on Bob's donuts
Controller of the warm deep fryer that charms cobras
Mostly it was aggravated ulcers over goat's legs
Will they go for maple, custard, buttermilk or wolfs bane?
Hm, late after your cinderella pulsate and crash I was rotating casts
Picture if you will a witching hour on a week night in the trenches
Where paranoia dead-ends in a bright florescent heaven
With sprinkles, I know right yum
Whether tummy ache or fever
Keep the funnel cake I'm honey glaze in vitro
In the company of similar believers
Sleepless, who hear the walls breathe and foam at the facial features
Now the yeast, a phoenix in the partially hydrogenated
Equal parts flour, faith, healing
Might replace your previously nominated Jesus
But only if you privy to the following secret of all secrets

Shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
With a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
Show up around 1 never get your God back
If you're just tuning in, walk into the light
Walk into the light

I boil oil too, not for scarfing
For CCs of Japanese innovation that screech into free parking
Purple heart and second chin that beseech him to squeeze the carbs into the motherboard
You can chew the Eucharist in cruller form
Locally a seedy danish underworld is bustling
Where jelly's not a celebrated stuffing, it's a puppet string
Pluck, nose for canola
5 cow stomachs like a mime with a rope going nowhere
Fast, right hand of god on my shoulder, crows feet swollen, dopey
Combing apple fritters over with folk of opposing cultures
Baby sitter cop thief reverend, body glitter, botched c-section, bronze teeth
Each progressively more sequestered
Yet if threatened will defend the raisin bread as codefendants
Some lose religion or view it as superstition
You can tell a friend if you are down to kill them

The fat boys are back, foam fingers over open arms
To feverishly reclaim their stomachs from golden jars
And stagger through the pulse of the gulch on a builder's dividends
Hiding high behind his guilty powdered-sugar fingerprints
Seething eventide fever, sidewalk feeling a little dicey
I'm snake-eye straight to the cakes icing
Might, fortune-teller up your favorite paper tiger stripe
Great, grace invaders, the first-name basis patron haters
Who compromise the pilot lights and flavors
Silent night, holy night, invite the pious out the pagan
Midnight kitchen doors un-caging the enablers like butchers in bloody aprons
Can I get a fucking amen? (Amen!)
Hazelnut raiders of the lost, navigate consecutive pastries like stations of the cross
No name no dayjob
Know the folk where it virgin mary toast by the loaf
Thanks Bob

July 4th, 1981
Candles of a Roman ilk
Unloaded from a Chevy truck
Into the home her folks had built
Patio was charcoals and extended fam in folding chairs
Safely arced around the yard to focus on the smoking flares
Couple cousins, uncles, aunts
Mostly grown-ups, couple brats
Baby Ruby's only two, she's too close to the jumping jacks
Mommy scoops her to the house, buckles up the booster seat
Rolls her to the storm door, let her long for all the lunacy
Telephone distracting Mom, Ruby wriggles out her strap
Fingers push the plexiglass, she's off into the sour patch
Past the pyrotechnics, undetected and invisible
Woke the sleeping beagle skipping toward the kidney swimming pool
Off into the yawning blue, the splash would mum the rocketships
Ruby's lungs were filling by the time her kin were cognizant
Many sprung and sprinted down, all arrive belated but
The beast she had earlier stirred had been alert since waking up
Canine let his gainer fly, water-top commotion grow
Howling guests assume the cloven hooves had come to do-si-do
Frenzied and congested deck, part to let the others see
Soggy beagle gently dragging Ruby in his yellow teeth
Laid the tiny body in the sun before her father‘s feet
When she choked the liquid through her bluish lips he dropped his knee
Help the air to reconvene, towel his shaking Ruby off
EMT confirm the save, everybody say "good dog!"You might also like7Embed
Birds of a black
Black feather stick together forever and ever and they always remember you
And all of the shit you do
They pass it to the baby birdies and then they remember too
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black
Without forgetting the face of the guy in the mask
When you see me baby will you scream or will you laugh?
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black
Little baby blue eye's eyes turn black

4 and 20 gory pantone black crows shredding innards
The silhouettes are fencing lefty scissors
Separating horn and hoof as evil's own arpeggiators
They piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors
Buy the getty image, green-cheese moon
Dead-of-winter shit, graveyard tchk! tchk!
Shifter shit, brother was a face card
Crown like a heart-shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his hydro-plaining pace car chase...
Wait up let me isolate the bass more
Gate of god's acre
Aim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here
Supposedly closure'l free the vipers out the bosom
Personally I think it's a bunch of bullshit
Prisoners, tradition is for lovers
God forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some ‘dip or play the dozens‘
Now I baptize skips in larvae and dental records
On a little plot pregnant with 6 million sentence-enders

And the tech support for tragedy's emphatically horrendous
Teenage operators explaining what bated breath is
Pass, I wish it were something I could diagram on a napkin so you won't feel so detached if it should happen to you privately
Publicly your shadows'll cat call back
Happy to split the button eye and burlap doll
Crack the crypt
Bats eject like cousin death's wing-ed lapdogs ricocheting sonar of the sacrilege
Now let me slow this whole shit down for all you half-goat cowards
I'll even grit my teeth for you
I am so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing me
It's "what do these symbols under the dresser mean"
Perhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young
Could've used a good lung
Still, proximity to corpses wasn't nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors
Fast forward, my knee in the gut of a glass coffin
"remember that cow in the dean's office?" seems awkward
And I know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous, ain't it?
Maybe a dialogue of howls that reshapes the jowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines
Either way - dope stone lion

And they call to let you know your friend is dead in a box
The crows have the tools to get the meat out of the box
Scientific, ritualistic, headstone cold foxes still rot
I'm not gonna rot, no, fuck that snot
You can let them let you rot, man
But I'm not going to watch
I'm not gonna stand atop your plot
I love you friends, but I'm just not
On the other hand if your ashes are scattered in the sea
I will swim in the sea and you'll be with me
And if your shit is scattered at the roots of a tree
I will climb that tree
Everything you think you're hiding shows
In the way you view the graves like a string of tiny thrones
Messages you'd tucked away for keeps has resurfaced to be heard amidst the butchery and beaks
You don't want the passengers to pass
You want each cow taxidermied fatter than the last
Mausoleum lighting is a rush
While it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch
A proud chest puffed to the heavens
Holds nothing if we're cutting past the muscle and the tendon
And we will be cutting past the muscle and the tendon...5Embed
Watch your step, Watch your mouth
We all know the way that a punk goes out

4 and 21 crows
None go south
For the supper when a punk goes out
Checkerboard of mothballed death-forms
Hauled via vaudeville canes
And encased where the claw marks wane off broadway the god way
Watch, our father
Commuters from the farms with news of el Chupacabra
Who transfuse soup out a fresh punk skull
Dumb full blood suckers
Only the chum suffers
Pine box butcher
Encouraging poor lighting
Said “a pall bore's not a sure sign of jarred lightning"
Harsh, that's how the yellow spine-diner was born
Feral feeding that strung his organs up like tire swing art
Chippin' a drippy set of broke bone grinders
More for the hive mind
Less for the land mine finders
Fine, no defacto leaders in the eatery
Unless you count the way they led his heart through his tuxedo tee
Straight out the front

Chew together when a punk goes out
Etiquette of tart-tongued ghouls
Never run truck jewels

In guttural grunts

Early sign of punk shows up on the diagnostic
Hm, pardon if I seem stand off-ish
All the see-sawed loss, I can't call it
All petite drawn straws and orange caution
Or outcast creeps re-involved for absolvement
It's gaudy, plus when a hell-bound offspring and yours share an office, all evolves salty
Watch, if fortune is a bitch with venom and laser tits
Maybe sin ‘ll make for sugar-flavored flesh
Kings taste terrible at best and rest in peace raw
The rest are recipes
Caw!

Some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns

As if guided by the trident of poseidon to cavort
Each a lumbering and boisterous glutton
Like a half-ton annoyance ‘til the heart-warming story went public

Shampoo and disinfect dead fluffy

Stem to stern, the butter cutter beelines well
Tongs butterfly the unzipped feline shell
We'll be escorting vital organs
With exception of the precious kitten's heart
Into the privacy of separate pickle jars
Or mayonnaise or jelly pick a card
Shit, pick a part and scissor
Stomach, lung, intestine or liver
In a world of sanitizers and preservatives forever
Brain exterminated through the whiskers
*kiss & blow* Ditched
I blank NY alone
We usher in the salts that call the husk home
Might embalm and stiffen and rid the fawn of all his liquids
Slather it in beeswax, wrap it up in ribbons
Like limb by limb, by tail, by ear, by chin
Within the hereafter I hereby win
I hope you vow to meow another day and never decompose

Slow Mozart, no I’ve never heard of knocking
Might’ve burst in on it, splits or skin popping
Opt out, sober on the eve of no saints day
Locate and aim for the token propane tank
Bang! Followed from a pulling of hair
To a homecoming sullied by a skull on a spear
It spun a human resources issue to public affair
Reciprocity is a pestilent compulsion to bear
And ultimately unfulfilling, concurrently that rigid upper lip and grudge are crippling
The wonder twins of bitching
Armchair hater, I wouldn’t piss on your coffin
But when I see your picture I draw dicks on it
The Ozone breakaway tux
Holds chicken wire ribs and paper mache guts
Pipe cleaner mustache, rope hands google eyes
Macaroni gas face, no plan to humanize
You are now rockin’ with the worst
Nothing up his sleeve, nothing here is what it seems
Paranormal weather, mysteriously disappearing bees
Not to mention the collateral delirium it breeds
Jeez, forgive him any dicey past
He from a tiny town called Deaths Icy Grasp
And he don't get out much, but when he do it's Beatlemania
Do not be asleep at the feet of his feelers radius
Too charitable, offerin’ the average joe some real estate
Between the Big Mouth Billy Bass and jackalope
Cozy in a moment of bliss
Snatch the food off your plate, snatch a goat off a bridge
No shit4Embed
Uh, greasy grimy gopher guts
Poolside, 0 for 1, I don't forget spoons twice
Lukewarm Folgers, mold on his moonpie
Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
My duty go from moving in packs, to sharing food with a cat
To "Ma, it's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half"
She said "I'll keep you in my prayers," I said "I need to hide a body"
She said "Ok, honey, talk to you on Friday"
Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter, according to the blood-and-water chapter
Weird, who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway?
Probably some surly dad, only child, 30 cats
Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
Except it doesn't always work like that

Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
Where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn
I told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric;
You are healthy, you are special, you are present"
Then I let them go
Oh...

You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
In the mirror sweating pitchers
Who's there: simian or lizard?
As it were there is a disappearing difference
In ambition and material
Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
Move as a godless heathen: black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius'
I'm a... That's better, here we here we go
Disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized
Contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized
Check! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
It is something he must handle on his own
The windblown way
Wanna win? Don't play

Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark
Where the grapevines climb a convenient barn
I told them, "You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted;
You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded"
Then I let them go
Oh...

I have been completely unable to maintain any semblance of relationship on any level
I have been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver me from peril
I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up and lip that kissed me on the temple
I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition that admits it wish its history disassembled
I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish that acted different when the bidding was essential
I have been a terrible communicator prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
I have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels

Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand
Where the low tide showcased a promised land
I told them, "You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive;
You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive"
Then I let them go
Oh

I was a dark, dumb student, no hooky rookie
Day tripping on visions of chickens that looked like R. Crumb drew 'em
They grew him in the royal dirt of Suffolk County's flooring
With the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms
Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles
Fit into the aforementioned or slip through the pinholes
'Zook' slip through the pinholes, crispy the godsender
Who thunk over a quarter plunk to local Mortal Kom vender (What's this?)
Broke the formal squad sensor, root down
Feelers out across the marsh before it was 'awesome cars'
My calling card cavalry cook in a '85 Dodge Ares
Gas for Huntington and back barely
Equipped with super soakers full of piss
And an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit
The kid pilot his ring king dummies to King Kullen
Where he hollered 'fuck the world' from a parking lot in the suburbs
What's this?
A couple spray cans and a little litter
But they'd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters
So fuck ;em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props
But things will still go bump when them halogens pop
Believe, or be there when it happens
The shaking of the plates off the mantle
The snaking of the flames off the candle
The lady of the lake off the answers
The mating of mistakes 'til they're de-planting cadavers
Now it's rest in peace Lou Peterson whose heater sung disturbingly to
Further re-evaluate your beast of burden's urgency
Damn doggy, good times, thanks
I wrote your name in wet cement by the Brooklyn Banks

A couple Playboy mud-flaps and hell on his heels
Beautifully echoed in the pace at which he shovel his meals
Like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter
So dinner split a lima bean in triplets, pick a winner
It took a couple summers puking pills behind the dumpster
As the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers
One shoe in a soupy gutter, one shoe in a velvet heaven
Where the mermaids harlem shake up out a lake of melted weapons

Extra the days of yore painted similar uber-ape shit

Sparky nails pigs, stigmata for all good sport
Garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court
And chase cheese fries with Binaca
They had shut the school down early
There were bombs inside the lockers
No concept of the problem, we responded like a snow day
And would clobber shit to flotsam, 'til the cop said it was okay
Okay show the squadrons back into their boxes
Like his Breakfast Club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors
And I walk into the office, coughing awful ether often
Flaunt a parking meter fever, knuckle up for Love and Rockets

I spell 666 star six nine click
Give his telephone a Viking funeral, bye bitch
Treble hook two birds, cheap thrills, free meal
Vacate Jellystone Park with your brie wheel

Now he sells le cars in Monty Burns' Cazal Frames
Half his life was likely to be Nikes on the L-train
Gnawin' on his dog toy, pocket full of deer blood
The only thing that's stoppin' him was Dokken in his earbuds

Up around noon
Found everything he loved crushed down to a cube
The new Kowloon chowline, two leads routing medicine and gruel
One is hemorrhaging money, the other jettisoning fuel
Identical water-separated pools
It was clever
But it wasn't ever neighborhood-degenerate approved
In swooped jukebox Fonzie, promptly
Bolts on his neck, one tubesock wonky

Aggravated people driving lemons over limits

Smart move taught never broadcast holes in his armor
End up another poached fauna

Handcuffed down to a toothless tease
Who got an X-marked mouth and a hooch machine
With eyes that tell the story of the woods that fetter
And a chest that sells the ending when it's pushed together
Been through the desert on a horse that's nameless
Now I'm driving through the city in the Porsche naked
Shores invaded by the new marines

Untrained pet with a pen name
Chest pain, bet he outlive his own endgame, anyway
Step around the rhythm of the red rain
Getaway car horn, stand by, tenth frame
Spare me the dramatics to ratchets, smile purdy (pretty)

Awoken as reanimated mummies from the sepulcher
Anonymous and secular and ribbons and exposed brain
Roll with grown men who still use code names
Fold crawl space on the SS coat tails
Might chase six legs through his oatmeal
Oh dear, no pets eat his own homework
Pet cruise cobble step shoes that are bone bugs
Holmes, sick to the fishbone comb
My yellow brick shtick ain't tip toe prone
It's a misthrown sticky bomb slipping off the fingers wrong
Any blips you're witnessing are living in the Sigma laws
Blip, blip, dag, these ghosts need a doctor
Shelter, clean Dunlops on a walker
She sells sea shells, he draws revenge
Plots on a chalkboard, watch what you walk toward

Live free, die fat
Rock shot to a kill screen time lapse

Yep
I could introduce you to another realm
Help you with the move
But only you can go fuck yourself
Cut to helter-skelter in glorious technicolor
With bumper to bumper
Sending turtle shells at one another
It's treasure hunters budding in
Some cannonball Running of Bulls
Sweating in the dead of summer
Red X on the bread and butter
Pardon while his pedal power
Shed the inseparable umbra
Reset the pecking order
Still ain't pick a second number
Dectective on some, "How you get so mega-extra-ultra?"
I said, "Never check the weather
And always dress for the tundra"
Merry "dawn of the mummy"
Heard a call in my slumber
Woke to a thousand years of a sauce-of-the-month in a bunker
Yum
You could be the lunker under pepper X
I feel like Professor Y
Why are all my friends depressed?
Why's this party feel like when I walked back into Selmer's Pets
In precious tears like, "Why are all my tetra dead?
Yet again?"
Land speed entirely contextual
Glacial pace, grand prix, space invader, camera B
Cam or not, copy room, camp ground or canteen
Every time you stand down, I pop out
Yelling, "And scene!"
Make a million paper cranes
Blindfolded, both arms
Stuck in different crane games
Under water, over coals
Whole of his spirit above him
Call now, I am always into somethin'

Golden hours like Mom tripping
"You come down here right this instant!"
Sits on the front step, chips and a Sunkist
Dumb for a sun-kissed brick or Pikmin
I click, click, it's difficult to pick one
Have to pick the wisdom in a particular condition
Like plain old birds in the same old food fight
Rebranded and draped in a good light
Boat break from a day at the bull fight
Oughta come pray in the radiant bullseye
I don't blame y'all, the force awakened
So I'm Flatbush Avenue forest-bathing
Blood pressure ain't a touch extra
My cholesterol back to nothing special
Skin clear and my legs strong
And my spine fused and migraine gonе
And Bodega spangled in a merе thirty five
Octillion lumens at a low angle
Through incense smoke from a folding table
It's basically nature's stolen cable
Til it ain't
Time is a pick to the ice
Right when you chilling it be chipping at the vibe
Most tip a hat and slip into the hive but I dip into the grid

CB squawking "find me those vice grips"
A mean Brian Eno mixtape, an ego lifeless
Adrift in the eye of the side quest
The sign read please don't feed the wildlife
Unless throwing meat to mislead the night shift
Son this is whirlwind country
A world flushed from the brush pen of Kim Jung Gi swirling
Junkyard tires and loveseats
And house pets all swept up in the one beast, I love y'all
Bring your adult teeth and move with the lows
A pulse and a juice for the pulp
Midnight, pushing obscene Katamari
Vs. little old me and what army? Huh...?
Loser/weeper, in the wee hours, speaking to Mu in the ether
I can see him in a earth tone 'lo hat
And throwback shoes like guess who at Easter
I can bounce ideas off an angel or demon
Or any other brand of Cthulhu
I can rinse in the ambient wind

Feeling dangerous, feeling like I gave you power
Trees rustle in they sleep, wildlife scurry to feed
It's a light on in the tower
Shadows move in a deep smile, rows of redundant teeth
They can see you's a coward
Street lamps is buoys in oceans of black
I'm swimming on my back
The moon but a yellow piece of crack in the firmament
Peer into the dark, Copernicus
Fellow travelers past tense
Wondering if it's our turn in the tournament
Every morning on the steps with my little herb
Every morning a mad woman come through feeding the birds
Walking crazy fast, tossing fistfuls of bread
Might as well be feeding the rats, but the rats already well-fed
Fentanyl in the pack, if they could they'd come back
From the dead and buy it again
I remember when nights was ambulance sirens
Watchin' 'em put bodies inside 'em
Sometimes somebody outside wilin'
On empty streets dead silent
Half empty stores scared to breathe
I sit on steps now with my lil' weed
I walk the long way around the 'jects
Them brothers looking a little lean
I'm taciturn on the strip, I get my shit, turn, and I leave
Pachyderm, I never forget the faces of thieves
Head full of worms, some days it's bees
Some mornings the air feels clean
I can see her coming, trundling down the block
Then stopped, picked a dead bird off the curb
Stuffed it in her bag
Teeth barely bared when she hurried past1Embed
To an uptick in unexplained cattle mutilations
I pack light, prowling past Xanadu surveillance
With a can of paint, and cat who bring her daddy home cicadas
The mayor of Thataway, I peel off with the gas nozzle
Steering with my knees, bedazzling the atlatl
With my hands, brick on the pedal, kick in the pants
Park the Plymouth in your kitchen with a list of demands
By the time they run the VIN, I've been a blip on the lam
If I'm lucky I can run, 'til I forget who I am
I'm the running man of Go street, never known cold feet
Age 6 learned to take a piss running full speed
Outran answering to others
While the cancerous among us stand hands on buzzers
Hucksters, that's why whеther clawing through the woodlands

Money, I'm a runaway
Runaways at home in every armpit
Since a moment after hell report a stolen Helm of Darkness
No Auntie Em vignetted yelling hello from the heartsick
Only vendors from the belly selling necklaces of garlic
I ain't neck and neck with nothing son
I'm not the neck and neck type
I don't even know what roses smell like
Left right, I don't even slow to wave let alone stay tuned
Let alone entertain grace in your escape room
Pack a lunch, all they got is rubber worms
And stuff that doesn't cut it for the tentacles of mother earth
Barefoot, running with the butterflies and hummingbirds
First to gut a Philly on the covershot of Runner's World
I don't catch up at the Peach Pit
I'm at peace when the animated wheel of feet spin
Still, notice whether waltzing out the bullpen
Or tossing the couch cushions

Grandma Mary prayed the rosary
Name of the father, son, and homemade pierogi
Whole thing of Oleo anointed by the Holy Ghost
In the kitchen cutting up potatoes for the Koshi
4 pots boiling at the same time
Mushrooms jumping out a pickle brine to change lives
30 minutes from the Poconos bunny slope
Where Lithuanian immigrants learned to shovel coal
The decor is white Jesus
All walls, everywhere you turn the guy's bleeding
Figurines, imagеs, even a Aes original
A pеncil drawing of the praying hands I drew in middle school
My other relatives thought it was pretty cool
I must've drawn like 6 of them shits to distribute
Round where the word of God is the good stuff
And 5 o'clock Mass fill the block with babushkas
6:02 back at the fort
You could smell the cigarettes through the door
Potpourri on the shelf, sun down, lightning bugs on the the porch
Way before the sundowning was too much to ignore
This a sharp-witted widow, who do you the fucking solid
Of speaking a different language when gossiping 'bout your mama
Her mama was Mociute to the children
She made a farmer's cheese and live to be a hundred million
As myliu tave, she would call us "kates", cats
I guess we were hyperactive little brats
It's funny 'cause she had like 10 kids
Though I only met the ones that lived past '76
They mostly been a rotating cast on the sofa

Bang on the water pipe, down come Leona

Black is the color of the snow
Snacks in the cupboard by the stove
3-wicks clutter up his home
Deep-six whatever you know
Keep fit shoveling the coal
Keep silly putty on the funnies
Nail down the sum of what you own
Phone every someone that you owe
Cut your own hair in the sink
Change into something that you'd wear
If you were summoned to the throne
Do advanced math on the walls
Talk to your plants, tell 'em something bad from the vaults
Try to split a lentil into threes
Visualize a future with your tabby in a broth
Make your own arrows, learn to throw an axe into a log
Get it casual as a cashew in the maw
Write a phone number with a magnum on your arm
One that when you call it someone answer but they aren't there to talk

Black is the color of the snow
Cash in the cupboard by the stove
Free kicks clutter up his home
The dream is a ferry in the fog
Sheepskin buffering the cold
Sweet wind to carry you to god
Free brunch buffet on the boat
Real maple syrup is involved
Real shame peace is a theory not a law

"Are you talking to me" or a thumper out the coat?
Draw something savage on the back or the front or the both
A taunt for the fungus and the mold
Stomp around the room like a child
Throw your fucking baba on the floor
Trauma down to ruin you inside
Body like a buoy in the tide
Vomit come shooting through his eyes
Brain in the pan, black is the color of the paint in the can
Remove all the tubes and the wires
Polish every tooth in your smile
Document the true and livin', not the irrefutably beguiled

Black is the color of the snow
Rats in the cupboard by the stove
Cheap tricks clutter up his home
The dream is a ferry in the fog
Queen-pin stuffing up his cones
Sweet wind to carry you to god
Least fit chumming up the moat
TV on clearance at the mall
Refreshing water disappear into mirage
Precipitation should be clear or not as all, but
Stick out your tongue and taste it
Chase it with a dirty smile
Find beauty in the wasted
We gon' be here for awhile
Fall back, fall down
Wave your arms and legs around
We make them all the same but
Angels, they look different now

O' death, O' death
Could ya please hold a moment, I am so in effect
In the red corner, black snow a notable threat
I'm in the blue corner, satin over solar event
Golden oval on the belt, granny floral on the trunks
Orange tiger on the robe, iron horseshoe in the glove
I ain't foreign to the dance, I been up against the ropes
And refs, granted never while I'm humming "Let it Snow"
Let it snow, I thread a whole cyclone eye
In no time, zebra coat never not bone dry
Get it, I don't wanna set the wrong tone
But I hear a bell ding, there another pawn go
Footwork dirty, a blur to the eye witness
Encourage a crowded theatre to curse at a fried Christmas
What plague add blood to the flakes
Something from another world, son, the water ain't safe
And I step in the arena with a hundred one apes
Looking dead at the upheaval like it's summer at the cape
I'm saying, nothing shake the mother of all hate
Like a plea to "hurry up I got another ball of snakes
On the schedule", the principal of other pressing matters
Press the button get the present company Abracadabra'd
This ring is a beach house, for critical beat downs
And free snow cones between rounds
It go, cash only, ashes ashes
Bet the farm, Aes get the dark cloud active
Pay-per-view event live, prehistoric man fights
Visual analogy of profound baggage
For the folks in the back row
Stomping on the floor when the black snow Glass Joe
Thank you, y'all have a safe night
See you in the morn, the forecast ain't rightEmbed
I like drawing pigeons
People tend to feed 'em or forbid 'em
Either way it's rare to see 'em individually considered
There's always like a million eating cigarettes and ketchup
I take a lot pictures, I been cropping out the extras
I been studying the independent measurements and metrics
The postures and the body types, the patterns on the feathers
Like some ritualistic tattoo dating back to their ancestors
While the bib and neck come dipped in precious amethyst and emeralds
It's a pity about the stigmas
How the cooties overshadow any beauty that enrich us
A white dove symbolizes peace and pacifism
A white dove is a pigeon, you muffugas is bigots
Yo, 3 toes forward, one toe ain't
1 AM sketching muscles on a plump little frame
Plus I love your pretty orange eyes and dumb little brain
I'll add a nimbus to atone for how we sullied the name

Phone, wallet, coffee, keys, lighter
I'm headed for the beyond, I'm a need a cease fire
Lighter, keys, coffee, wallet, phone
The whole street is lava, the beyond is not a go

I seen this one Da Vinci exhibit
In which they reconstructed dozens of machines he invented
From diagrams in his codex, open and beautifully scanned
Marvels of engineering, broke up by Vitruvian Man
Margin exploding with the future like it grew from his hand
Plus every annotation backwards, homie, who is this man?
I bet his brain projected images of orbiting equations
That would later become warships, or attempts at aviation
Or some irrigation system steering water different places
He could picture and commit to paper from a grip of angles
Honestly it's pretty overwhelming
Contraption after contraption that had us "holy hell"-ing
Later in the afterglow, grab a tablet, have a go
I might invent some vehicle, or diving suit, or catapults, or...
Fast forward to the morning
I had caught a thousand tags and drew a half a pigeon poorly, oh well

I told my homie I had drew some pigeons
And was feeling like it could be the root of future submissions
It'd be cool to draw a thousand and layout a book of sketches
He said "how many you got?" I said "like 6 or 7"...
'What?!' He said "a thousand is a lot"
I said "that's why it's gotta be an actual thousand on the dot
I hit 'em with that thousand to make up for what they not
Once you mix that many bodies it becomes about the flock."
He told me "if you do it, its a cruise to manufacture"
I took it as a challenge, but regretted it soon after
See the point was always celebrate the individual vessel
That I pitched a package deal at all is pretty disrespectful
Plus a thousand is a lot
Sometimes I get excited before really sizing up the job
I think I drew like one more on a red-eye into Queens
I ain't even make a dozen, I been eyeing other thingsEmbed
Peace, peace, peace...
I'm on that... keep the light meter guessin'
The dreaded French exit for the sight-seeing lensmen
Boulder and a see-saw, t-minus 3, 2
Peace y'all, master of the sea and the heavens
I'm P-noid, traffic beeping in the key of my penance
Even the wind in the willow ask "What's the frequency, Kenneth?"
Tune in, how's my driving?
Drivers start dialing, I drive like a man who dies trying
Here salt of the earth all-seers
Read palms thru "times three" Walgreens readers
Drawstring eaters, no staff to memo
No cabs to flag, just you and the black echo
See if it says hello back
If it says hello first, hit 'em with the Cheshire Cat
This ain't a circle to a checkered flag
It's people keen to murder for a level map
Thief market buzzing by what use to be McDonald's
The currency is crystal and deconstructed Elantras
Anonymous warning shots are the modern "attention shoppers"
A stop in defense of honor's a belly flop in piranhas

One time I met Mr. T in New York in the 80s
I was 7/8-ish, waiting for a table at Carnegie
With my family who did not always agree on what was wavy
But would shut up once a week because we loved our fucking A-Team
Pops seen him sitting there, beard and Mandinka hair
Whispered so that we could hear, "guys, Mr. T is here"
Mr. T is fucking real?, I mean I know he's real
It's just we only seen him on TV, he's like a superhero to us
We were trying to catch a glimpse, my mama said "don't make a scene
He probably having lunch with friends, I think they 'bout to pay and lеave."
I'd never seen a famous pеrson let alone Baracus
He bout to walk right by us, that's more than I could process
I felt a mighty presence entering my elbow room
Looked up and seen the rings, each its own yellow moon
I seen enough gold to break the average neck in two
Feather hanging from the ear, gear that say don't mess with you

No fools, no suckas
Be good to your mother
No dummies, no punks
I pity every last one
One, one, one

Mr. T's a hundred feet tall (He's five foot ten)
Arms like trucks, probably punch through a wall
My father said his name and sorta nodded to acknowledge him
Which would in turn confirm that this was not some type of hologram
Big, warm smile earring to earring
From a television toughie to endearing it's eerie
Started rubbing his belly, then a quip for the pups
"It take a place like this to fill Mr. T up"
Get it? For those of you who don't know the establishment
They're famous in Manhattan for serving gigantic sandwiches
We shared a laugh about the portions
A humanizing peek behind the on-screen performances
He kept it brief, said his piece and with that
Disappeared in a cloud, mystique obscenely in tact
He played it perfect to a nervous kid he met at his peak
We spent the meal like "holy Moses we just met Mr. T."

Close to 40 years have passed
My hair is gray, my belly's fat
Still when I hear his voice I'm 7/8-ish back on 7th Ave
Now with a perspective that I never had
Respect for who he's been and is, and questions I won't get to ask
About this one Chicago boy, the youngest of a dozen
Who was drawn to throwing suckers out the club for bringing drugs in
Then scouted by Stallone who sends the Rocky part
He bodies it, on Letterman he says he primarily still a bodyguard
Huh, born protector, icon or community
Plus network television like a rocket to the moon of cheese
Pro wrestling, cartoon, comic books, records
Break to beat cancer, then he back to spread the message
Look, never talk to strangers
Stay in school, don't hang out where the yay is
Love yourself, and fuck designer labels
Thank him for the guidance
Thank him for the cereal, seriously it was righteous
No fools, no suckas
Be good to your mother
No dummies, no punks
I pity every last one

Pull up to the window please, bleed the sacrificial goat

I was at the drive through
Playing hooky from the wild goose
Losing minutes in the time loop
I had planned to slide thru
Seen the signage in the side view
Had to slip into the flight suit
At the drive thru, at the drive thru
Perusing the entirety of side two
At the drive thru, at the drive thru
Headed into overtime times twoEmbed
Grabbed a coffee, ran into my friend outside the hair salon
She said, she on her break, can she come up and roll a jay?
We'll say her name is Abby, though Abby is not her name
Ok, scan the FOB talking neighborhood goss'
Elevator to a maze, it snake around to my spot
Before the key hit the lock, she was asking me "Is that yours?"
Beside the door a navy button down balled up on the floor
Weird, I take a knee on some "I do have one like it, but no"
And pick it up slow to revеal a few other items
Abigail likе "Oh that is certainly a tweaker's pile of stuff,"
A realization that demand a weaker tea inside my cup
White noise hummin' in my ear to the wood
I hear the bath water running something is clearly afoot
Someone is clearly inside, I look at Abby like "I'm going in
Maybe you should stay here", she said "No, I'm in."  Holy shit...

Be cautious...  keep calm...
Sneak the door open the apartment is tossed
Everything everywhere all at once, all the faucets are on
Let's draw the room so you can better picture all that befalls
I got this loft that when you walk in the ceilings are pretty normal
Then a dozen feet later it's 20 feet of beams and mortar
I inch in far enough to peek around that first corner
No sign of life in the bathroom only debris and disorder
We baby stepping 7 feet in, where the kitchen begin
Records and books in the sink, the condition start to sink in
Another few to that rubicon where the pad opens up
To see the answer to my questions in the rafters above
There is a man with no shirt on wearing his pants around his ankles
Jungle gym-ing over both us, I mean we are talking angles
He's mumbling incoherently, there's something in his system
I'm processing but need to make decisions, ok let's go
"Hey! You need to get down right now"
Abby yelling "Get the fuck down and get out!"
He's on a different planet, drifting to a distant moon
I'm pretty sure he don't even know we are in the room
You might also likeHey, you need to get down right now, get the fuck down and get out
You need to get down right, get the fuck down and get out
Hey, you need to get down right now, get the fuck down and get out
Get the fuck down and get out, get the fuck down and get out
This isn't working, the energy is berserk and
We're backing up to the hallway, then down to the office nervous
"Yea hi... so there's a naked guy in my ceiling"
The staff look up at me tripping like "Oh my god, is it Steven?!"
Uh... who the fuck is fucking Steven?
Y'all seem to know some shit I don't, I ain't exactly meet him
The manager on some he and this building have got some history
We'll attempt to go and talk and him down, but also called the city
30 go by, when the elevator ding
And drop a trio in the lobby and heaven and nature sing
It's the manager and super with a man in my Nikes
Oh that's my leather too, ejected, but god damn he look nice
Steven is glum and despondent, wafting a brutal bouquet
They sit him down on the sofa, he look confused and ashamed
But if I'm honest also looks like he could pull out a blade
That's when 2 officers show up and all is fully explained...
Ok the police are with Steven to see if he's even lucid
I'm on the other side of the lobby completely stupid
The super and the manager finally get a sec
To offer some backstory 'bout this morning's events
They tell me Steven suffers from mental illness and drug addiction
His episodes have kept him in and out the shelter system
Some lady in the building use to give him her couch
But his condition led to far too many issues to count
He's even scaled up the building before and jimmied inside
And been aggressive with the tenants like infinity times
He not permitted on the premises, but this is your life
That's when the officer invited me to give him my side
I said "Well, first of all I ain't the one that called
But also we're like a meter from the player involved
I can brief you on the basics if the aim is resolve
But I ain't trying to agitate him if I say something wrong
How 'bout we move 10 feet around the corner to talk?"
He said "I can't leave my partner alone with someone this gone"
Ok uh... seems fast to be at an impasse
Then he pulled the pen and paper out, and this is what he ask
"Do you wanna be the victim?"
"What? No, I didn't want it. I'm not sure what you want"
"Do you want to be the victim?"
"Ohhh... you're doing a script
Over communing 'bout the nuance of a human at risk
How bout we skip to where you tell me what the future can hold?"
He said "A felony B&E and whatever he stole
We'd take him down to the jail and they'd put him back on the street
They just just ain't got the kinda resources a Steven would need"
I said "He doesn't need a felony he doesn't need a cell
There's gotta be a way to get him headed for some help."
He said "Programs exist but none of them work
It's either charge him with the crime or feed him back to the earth."
That's the bleakest shit I ever heard
I don't even have the words
I'm 'bout to run to see what evil was done
I guess the jacket was a gift but he can leave in the dunks
Upstairs sucked, the cat's doing fine, the rest is just stuff...
I just seen Steven eating lunch...Embed
I Will Send You Flowers...

King of world peace, purple aura, laurel wreath
Secure the flora, orchidaceae to fungal spore release
To algaes in the coral reef
Florida orange, Georgia peach
Poison ivy, even his defensive line is floral-themed
Dahlias grow out of my back, hyacinth over my trunk
12,000 species of moss, agree to upholster his tongue
Tubers and roots in his shoes, gimme a feud to diffuse
Bury 'em all in bouquets, de-escalation ensues
You looking stupid shooting the fade in petunias
Or doing dirt in the daisies, I'm changing into bermudas
All of that doofus shit you oozing just don't play in the Tulips
If human nature vs nature nature is brewing, my goodness
Guns and roses turn to roses and roses
Country roads is overgrown with begonias
Come press your nose to the lotus

om birthstone to first snow
To posies in the pockets of your church clothes
To fertilizing where the red fern grows
I know a speeding bullet over Broadway is cathartic
I just hope before its target it talk to a few samaras
Helicoptering from canopy to forest floor and garden
Forget the aggressive warning, it's more of a "Hello darling"
Even Ares pull over to say "ay-ayo", don't say I said it
But god damn that vegetation is, dare I say it, disarming
Dog, wait'll they take in the morning glories
Or petals that smell like bubblegum and marshmallows warming
I love to see a horde who swore to burn the steeple at night

Let's hope you answer to them violets 'fore they eat you alive
Whatever ring-leading led you to revel in things grieving
Got the kingdom of chlorophyll assembled for spring-cleaning

I like rivers, I like rivers
Sailboats, fisherman, skinny-dipping swimmers
Kids turning rocks over catching lil critters
Eagle in the pine tree eyeballing dinner
My uncle used to cut school to hit the Susquehanna
Kept himself a rod and reel he hid up in the bramble
The school took attendance, it was quiet as a mouse
He was at the river pulling out a giant by its mouth
A river in the daylight is energy and life
A river in the dark can be a genuine surprise
You might find somе lovers getting cozy on the shorе
Or a cold-blooded psychopath disposing of a corpse
Sitting by the Hudson river talking to a ghost
"I wish that we could rock a beat and smoke an L at Tone's
I miss the way you rhyme and how you never had a clone
Ain't a motherfucker living that could ever crack the code"

I like rivers, I like rivers
Freight ships passing through old drawbridges
It looks so cool when you catch it from a distance
A little less cool when you stuck inside your Civic
I wonder what could possibly be lurking on the bottom
I look into the water and imagine all the options
A fish we never knew about, some rusty old jalopy
The murder weapon used to catch the aforementioned body
I seen a beaver chilling by the bank of the Willamette
We gazed upon each other undeniably enchanted
A wave of telepathic information through the filter
It said "when I go to heaven I want you to have the river"
He also said the others had agreed that I was chosen
Just don't mention it front of them as gloating is for no one
I'm pretty sure you don't have the authority to say this
But thank you, I accept, I'll have my lawyer draft the papers

Hard to put a price on water for the village
I jumped into the Amazon to launder all my atoms
The Chao Praya had me spilling coffee on the captain
My heart is in the East River floating on a frisbee
That came in from the Long Island Sound to sojourn in the city
It's not the kinda water where you'd throw a Triple Lindy
If you get some on your skin they probably notify your siblings
I picture a scenario where someone's held me captive
And escape would mean to build a raft and navigate some rapids
I wonder if my training from the school of TV magic
Would beget some makeshift watercraft that make off for Damascus
In practice I have no desire get into the water
I like to know it's there in the event I ever wanna
Waterfalls, tributaries, Lichtenberg figures
Twilight fireflies, I like riversEmbed
"There's nothin' you or anyone can do, this is my nightmare
I've got to get out of it myself, just as I got into it"
First uninvited tech I hear pingin'
Ring in a cameo from the hammerstone
Bam, the fantasy brandishing a banana phone
Cramp into the glamper van, vanish off the candid cam
Frying pan to fire like a vandal hand to Montana Gold
Fan the flame of animals with access to the roof like Michelangelo
About to free a statue from a cube
Hold a can of ruby like a spam musubi
In a blink I turn a block or two to pomegranate smoothie
All-state ball of fleas, walk in front a greyhound
In J's so clean, even Paul of Thebes came out
Office in the hall of meat, I can't even check the mail
Without a trail of handlers waving around dog treats
Here boy! Aes from before the first star wars
I survived action park, I survived lawn darts
Salsa bar all stars, buzzin' and bitchin'
I got a seat at the summit for any son of perdition, wasup

All type a shit, all, all type a shit
Dashing through the atlas throwing magic at the sciences
I be in the crows nest most days
I know how the whole mess rotate
All type a shit, all, all type a shit
Mashing thru the mire, the master of my environment
I been doing laps of the lost world
I could draw a map to the raw nerve

It ain't the hood to play who's who in
I mean you ain't even you in it to who is
I cook in the every nook, I'm a snap of the sewer cap
It's a mile of uneven cobble, a map of the booby traps
I been active around the alleys, beyond where the taxi taxi
Beyond where the bus'll bus ya, with blood on the classic khakis
A cannonball into traffic, a fire escape his trapeze
A lapse in the record when he circled back to tag the Applebees
And procure the appetizer breadsticks
They kill us in the long run but unite us in the present
A sign of life in the dead ends, even if it's mostly mildew
You ain't get it if you still on that "What are you getting into?"

A people that don't jump at the power that bees behest
Come bounce around the house of flying rejects
We been eating where upheaval is a feature not a defect
Tortellini MREs and zero dirty dishes
Only dirty minions yelling over yellow journalism
I got witches and wizards who opt to summer under bridges
Over sun-kissed in the tropics, maybe something's in the liquid
I'm foreign to the comfort of performance for the glory
Every yard is part of out-running an origin story
That get him pressed into the corners
And connecting the dots in no order
Learned to render any exit I want
It's a hole in the floor, it's a door on the bricks
It's a bike in the alley when you can't warp to the ship
I stuck a fork in myself before you were spores in a dish
The mission only as important as that lure in your lip
Sure as shit

Holy mountain surf club 
Goalie pads, bunker suit, work gloves, surf's up
Be the first to shaka with the scourge of god, circa now
Waving at the mountain goats and "shoulda hired a sherpa" crowd
It's perfect, brick and mortar curling into character
That canopy, that cannonballing barreled in the aperture
Stupefied face of a driver in the moment he realizes
He is ultimately just another passenger 
Who is driving who, and who's at one with the upheaval?
Plus, who is gonna free you from the stomach of what eat you?
You might just be that telephone that make the hunter's belly glow
Or better, get ya pinged and guess the ringer though some jelly rolls 
Cut the tracker out his neck at a Hess
I had to go in for napkins, nobody so much as flinch
It's like they know what this is
Another floater out to own the night
Who maybe know the road
But doesn't know he doesn't own the rights

Yeah, at devils curve he passed an ailing dog
That bit into his shaping like the paving at the wailing wall
And trailing off of the panko he had Banjo'd for the village clout
Had only brought him closer to the brokers at the witch's house
Smoking jacket fit him even though it was a size below
Bloated liver ribboning the crimson of his sinus holes
Anchors on his forearm told the story of this belly up
But hadn't quite been finalized or giantized by anyone
Heavy hums, hissing lawns the jazz that all his neighbors hate
From when he rode the last bus and made cap guns out of paper plates
Last month he was headed east, at least that's what he had in mind
The baggage was too heavy so instead he headed back in time
Madeleines don't eat themselves but best believe the people will
When comfy in the cozy of getting groceries or the diesel bill
Seasons still going to change I guess a rake is still a rake
I guess it is what it is until the breaks become a break
I put a flag on a island
Turned out to be the back of giant
When it woke one day in the spring

Back road workers, in the rye applying pressure
Where the map show serpents
Backbone of the disturbance
The smoke is notable if no deterrent
I been fevered in the cabin, up and headed for the haunting
With my head in my extended hand, perpetually coughing
I guess around the"S" around the tentacles of Audrey
Started entertaining skeptics mighta second guess the calling
It's a strafe to the shoulder, an ego A/B avoidance
Against some certain death insurgency to boil it to a coin flip
That said there's no boiler at the appointment
Just a pulling out of hair hysterical over deployment
I'm a student of the blooper as a part of the bit
It gets em whoopin' when I'm snoopy with a scarf in the wind
Scanners report a flying saucer barfing cardinal sin
No mention of defense against some forces larger than it, look

Turned out to be the back of giant

I was thinking about Van Gogh recently
I was never really a huge fan of his paintings
But I wouldn't say I actively disliked them either
It's just never been my thing
I found myself thinking about a specific Van Gogh painting
Which I've since learned is called "Landscape with Snow"
I looked it up to see if it still looked as I remembered
And it pretty much did
But this time, I decided I liked it … (Oh my god)
I can't explain why (You need to leave)
This all led me to Van Gogh's Wikipedia page
I wanted to find out if history considered him
Primarily a landscapе, portrait, or still-life painter
He did thеm all
I browsed the page and didn't really find my answer
But I did come across the following sentence
"Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime
And was considered a madman and a failure. " (Damn)
Damn.  I mean, I kinda knew that much about him
Wild life, wasn't famous until after he died, etc
But even considering all that, I kept going back to that sentence
Van Gogh started painting at 27
And only worked for about 9 years before committing suicide
And while that's not that long
He did make around 900 paintings and 1000 drawings
I guess I say all that to say this
As a guy who recently decided
He somewhat likes a single painting by Vincent Van Gogh
For reasons I can't quite describe
It does make me sad to see a man with mental health issues
And a passion for art summed up as an "unsuccessful madman failure"
Even if he was in fact financially unsuccessful, and kind of a madman
A failure?  I dunno
I kinda like that Landscape with Snow, and I'm glad he painted it
