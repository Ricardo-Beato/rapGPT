3 ContributorsParty Time LyricsIntro/Chorus: {unknown singers}
It's party time, and we came here to party
So get up and move your body, cause it's party time
It's party time, and we came here to party
So get up and move your body, cause it's party time

Come inside, the time is fine and I'm
Really ready to drop a heavy bassline
On the crowd that's loud and proud the rhyme
Is mine and the jam of party time
We're well equipped to flip and trip you out
I never slip but I rip the jam no doubt
So grab a girl ?? I know you wanna play
The funky jam I never quit until the break of day
Here we go on a Afrolistic journey
Here come the jam but don't forget to bring ??
To make sure the beat is upheld
The beat is raw and Run's banged it well
To make it take you to your destination
It's just the jam that slam across the nation
I gotta rock, you know I gotta good rhyme
So grab a girl, and listen to the good times
Now sweat til you're wet and get done
And I'll bet you get some..
Heat to release the piece to have fun
So just grab a girl, cause it's party time

Groove, breathe, wind blowin the leaves
I'm at ease, can you feel the funky sensation
I might take a vacation
On the seven seasons
Reasons to be cheerful, sun shinin, Run rhymin
I'm right behind him
Jay, you know where to find him
Shinin like a diamond, if I'm lyin I'm dyin
{girrrrrrrrrrrls, drive me crazy}
So fine, goin out of my mind
I keep em goin, they sayin, I've got the rhyme
Ooze, cruise, gonna take a cruise
Jing-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling I'm never singin the blues
Afros, studios, doin shows
Four-O's I suppose, no one knows
Who's rockin the hoes, tell me that
You gotta be (funky)
Chorus

Now let your body be free
And yeah, go you know
Never slow the flow til it's time to go
Cause that ain't the way you play the crowd
You gotta mingle, single girls allowed
So round em up, get a cutie in the spot
Look at the booty, do me, time to rock
And make all the girls give up the play
Get on the floor and make your day
So you're illin, still it's four o'clock
You won't leave til you see em close the spot
You gotta stay til they play the last song
Til the night gives light to the early morn'
Check the place and the taste of the bass is on the case
A negative thought that you brought just erased
Put away the nine and keep in mind
That the jam'll slam when it's party time
Chorus (*repeat with ad libs to fade*)Embed
