In a foreign with a foreign hot thot
That bitch gave me top top, top
While I drive this Nascar
Shout out to Kay Kay

Shouts out to your bitch, shouts to your thot
All she know is papa, all she know is papa
Cause I be going Gaga, cause I be going crazy
I drive a lot of hot cars, I drive a lot of hot cars
I got a fucking big house, I got a fucking big
And I'ma grown man by far, and I'ma grown man by far
