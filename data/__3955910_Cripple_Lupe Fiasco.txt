74 ContributorsCripple Lyrics
Turn the beat up some more
Ay-yeah-yeah, anchors

Uh, rectangle full of color
Complicated man sits, dedicated to the rudder
Under Apollo, over feeling under as a swallow, Wadjet wallows
Instead he looks for Yetis in tomorrow
And do-gooders become regretters for giving garble
At the art show out in Park Slope
Broken dancers rather flatten cardboards than work at Arco
Flippers who feat feets riff contortionists hips and grease slippers
Tweezers release slivers
From lines with deep splinters, paws for sweet skippers
Another key-figure's of East River's who eat liver and drink liquor
And root for Bird due to an unconscious urge to beat niggas
Who prefer sweet, steep sleep
And to pull hoes with the ease of police triggers
Sikhs at the hair show, Arabs at the airport
Caucasians in the projects, niggas anywhere though

People lovingly exclaim
People lovingly exclaim
People lovingly exclaim
People...

Beauty is the largest
Obstacle to obsess
Decorate the sergeant
Community resistance in progress

Pull out game strong like the Waco Kid
But also like a lifeguard, now that don't even make no sense
But since, if the swimmers ain't got no rings on
Don't be a fag, let me stab that Yoo-Hoo with my ding-dong
Fruits of interracials, my banana's bigger than King Kong
Both ways seem wrong like nobody in China is good at ping-pong
Seem wrong?
That's evidence they shouldn't be passing their genes on
That was racist, but I'ma run with it
Like every sagging pair of pants has to have a gun in it
So I undid it, like a Singapore with gum in it
Does that mean if I let you ride it, I can put my thumbs in it?
Uhn—nasty, but let the moment pass, only wave if they ask
And catch me at the scene of the crash, karma
They hate blood like Blade
So they hate cuz like an English teacher grades

Beauty is the largest
Obstacle to obsess
Diaspora and sonnets
Community resistance in progress
People lovingly exclaim
People lovingly exclaim
People lovingly exclaim
People...

The city: population control, occupation parole
Hope the swayed persuades and this conversation cajoles
Not to be Enron
Alexander Hamilton of Cassandra's Agamemnon
The environment is more than just a panda at the wind farm
Looks cool but it's bull as cool fusers
And the abusers fuel the dull losers
To make fools of the schools and pool Bueller's
The crusade to legislate oxygen
And put it in a box just like Desiree Washington
Fortune cookie, First Panda accelerated profit
And hope Santa fill my socks with highly-decorated moccasins
My, how the roles have reversed
So now we gotta eat 'em for dessert
Bop the kids just to free 'em from the curse
Dress up the thots in lingerie and feed 'em to Levert (uh-huh)

Beauty is the largest
Organize the objects
Diaspora and sonnets
Community resistance in progress
Diaspora and sonnets
Community resistance in progress
Woah—the people lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)
People lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)
People lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)
Community resistance in progress
Pe-pe-people lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)
