Check, check, check, check
Check, check, check, check, check, check (ooh-ooh)
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch
Mm, yeah, yeah

Na na na (Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh), marijuana
Oh na na, smoke the ganja

From them hills we go
Lookin' for another high, bless my soul
If I get too high, let me go
Then I wanna fly like an eagle, yo
I wanna run through those trees
Choppin' 'em all down, burn in the breeze
Then I'm at so much ease, feel like I'm floatin' on the ocean, please
Don't fuck up my high
Chillin' in the zone, in a trance with my eyes shut
Wrap this joint so tight
Dealin' with my own type of lighter, what?
Don't ask for a hit
Be careful what you ask for, you might get it
Wanna try my shit? Only connoisseurs can hang when I split it
You might also like
Oh na na, marijuana
Oh na na, smoke the ganja
Oh na na, marijuana
Na na na, smoke the ganja
Oh na na

I smoke the Acapulco, it make me go loco
I like the marijuana and I blaze up the ganja

Oh na na
I stay in this lane
Bitches better keep up or they gonna miss the train
You might try in vain
You ain't gonna make it to the station, mane
For all y'all missin' out
Wishin' you could fuck her for the weed we dishin' out
I make shit simple
We smoked all the most potent weed for the temple
There ain't no example
Here we cultivate for the mind and the mental
Just breathe that in
Listen, I don't even know where to begin
You feel that urge?
Like a shock through the body and you're gonna feel the surge
This shit is is a blur
Like I took a mushroom my life's all swerved
Oh na na (Oh na na), marijuana (Marijuana)
Oh na na (Oh na na), smoke the ganja (Smoke the ganja)
Oh na na (Oh na na), marijuana (Marijuana)
Oh na na (Na na na), smoke the ganja (Smoke the ganja)Embed
