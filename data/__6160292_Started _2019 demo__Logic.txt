Yeah
This shit is God level, the rebel nobody could revel
I'm sick as the devil, I'm Dwayne Johnson you fuckin' pebble
Presidential with the bezel never want to embezzle
My dick big, my money gross, let's toast to excess
Peep the success bitch I'm in the middle of little Italy
Literally no way you could ever get rid of me
'Cause I started from the bottom the basemеnt
The fuckin' garbage now I'm on top and you talkin' shit
Hell nah bitch, you mad that I'm rich, you mad that I madе it
I'll rub it in your face and paint it in your blood just to illustrate it
Leave these pussies castrated and faces exacerbated
Spend all day talking about me, you fascinated
I rip your intestines out of your abdomen through your asshole
And choke you wit' 'em, I'm sicker than venom I'll murder you
Like OG's in prison do to child molesters and rapists of women
I'm a beach shark that grew legs and evolved from swimming
You know I started from the bottom
Flows I got 'em, bars I got em', yes I got 'em
Leave you stutterin' g-g-g-get you down like you fuckin' Joe Biden
Ridin' in the whip with the homies on some m.A.A.d City shit
This that gritty shit, Brooklyn '95, New York City shit
You can hate me now, P. Diddy shit
I started from the bottom, man, I really did
And everything they say is true when you get really big
I made itYou might also likeEmbed
