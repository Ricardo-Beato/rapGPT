9 ContributorsNothing Out There for Me Lyrics
There ain't nothin' out there
A Missy Elliot exclusive
I know one thing Beyoncé better not answer this phone
Hundred ladies ain't free, I ain't got no money either, shoot
We 'posed to been at the club
Hello?
Beyoncé, I know you ain't lettin' that broke down, insecure
LL Cool J-wanna-be nigga keep you in the house for another Friday
Yo, just, just go ahead I'ma stay here with my man
Ain't nothin' out there for me

My man don't like my friends
Girl, your man ain't no good why he tryin' to keep you in?
He say they influence me
If I was an influence, I'da been said, "Leave"
But boy, I love him so
Girl, we late for the club, why you still don't wanna roll?
'Cause I got my prize right here
See, the guys at the party
Ain't nothin' out there for me (Come on)

Ain't nothin' out there for me (No, okay), this is where I wanna be (Okay)
I done already been in the streets (Uh-huh)
And I ain't came across nothin' so sweet (So sweet, okay)
He's the only man that I love, and I don't need more than one (Okay)
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out (Yeah)
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about
You might also like
I know he's insecure (Oh), every time I leave out the door
And you lettin' him spoil yo' night? Live your life, you ain't even his wife
He ain't gotta worry 'bout me 'cause I got somethin' more sweet, oh
Oh, you must got a diamond ring
And I know I'm so lucky, ain't nothin'

Ain't nothin' out there for me (Okay), this is where I wanna be (Okay, where I wanna be)
I done already been in the streets (Uh-huh)
And I ain't came across nothin' so sweet (Oh, okay)
He's the only man that I love (I love), and I don't need more than one (Okay)
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out (Oh)
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about

I really love him, he's my baby for sure (My baby)
I can show him, I love him more then ever before (And I love him)
And he don't know me in love like the time that we met (I adore him)
I adore him and no one had me out there like that (I love him)
I really love him, he's my baby for sure (I can show it)
I can show him, I love him more then ever before (I love him)
And he don't know me in love like the time that we met (I adore him)
I adore him and no man has come closer than that (There ain't nothin' out there)

Ain't nothin' out there for me, this is where I wanna be (This is where I wanna be)
I done already been in the streets
And I ain't came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love (I love), and I don't need more than one (More than one)
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about
Look, you goin' or what?
Go ahead, I'ma stay here wit' my man
Ain't nothin' out there for me
There's a lot of guys with cash and they like to spend money fast
Now is you sure about that?
I'm chillin' with my man, what part don't you understand?
Yeah, I'm sure about that
I think you should really go, I heard the party is out of control
Make sure you're sure about that
I don't care about no club
'Cause my man is all I love, yeah, I'm sure about that
Don't let 'em blow your high, go out and have a nice time
Is you sure about that?
Girl, I do not get high and with him, I'm spendin' all my time
Yeah, I'm sure about that
Okay, stay with your man, I'll be at the club doin' my dance, woo
You're the only one that I'm thinkin' about5Embed
