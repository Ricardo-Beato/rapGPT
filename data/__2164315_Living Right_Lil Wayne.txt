Livin'

Nigga, that's me in that nice-ass house
Butt-naked bitch with a nice ass
Walkin' 'round saying, "You got a nice-ass house"
My phone keep ringin' though, my bad
I think my girl got me on spy cam now
My homies call cocaine "white trash"
Charge you double just to take my trash out
I cannot fuck wit' you, bitch, 'cause you gon' get a nigga busted
Worryin' 'bout the wrong things while I'm hustlin'
Put the dick up in your mouth while it's runnin'
Bitch, don't ask no questions
Soon as I heard this, a young nigga killed it
'Cause I go too hard, I eat beats, mmm, scrumptious, delicious
Shoot you in your kidneys
I hope you see blood when you pissin'
We run up in your house on Christmas
And don't ask no questions
Just shoot whoever's present
While they open their presents
Oh please, Lord, forgive me
I just talked to my Reverend
Asked him if I'm the Devil
He said, "That's these bitches"
See, I'm from New Orleans, that bitch is infested
Shootouts like the Westerns
Kill you and your bestie
Pay niggas to do it correctly
Two Ninas, they lesbians
I gotta shoot you with both or else one'd get jealous
I make money, not exceptions
Take pills like breath mints
She just get dick and refreshments
Free all my dogs in corrections
We all we got, don't need extras
We don't expect shit
We don't get mad over pussy
I'm probably lyin' in some pussy
While fools out here dyin' over pussy
And that's what I don't understand
You might also like
'Cause a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right (Livin')
Yeah, a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right, mmm (You see me)
Don't get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga livin' right, yeah (Livin')
Bitches see me and start gettin' right
Because they know a nigga livin' right (You see me)

Standin' on the top, I got a
Lot of observations
Young nigga, lot of options
You, you
Runnin' through a check
Buyin' all the champagne, blowin' up the net
And settin' all the trends, showin' niggas what's next
I was drinkin' coffee, smokin' weed on the jet
Probably wit' your wifey in the back for pillow talk
But we ain’t talkin', gettin' top while ain't no top
Swear to God, I had a chopper
Now the gun biz are the friends hoppin' out a helicopter
I be rollin' up the doctor's wishes
Countin' up the money, kickin' out the bitches
'Cause they all up on you, but be gone when it get real
Bitches ain't shit but a brick through your windshield
Shows in the evening, business meetings in the morning
(Ho)
Goons on deck, don't make a nigga sick 'em on ya
(Go, go, go)
Niggas talkin' shit, gon' make a nigga get pneumonia
Wrist so cold, think it's sick and got Ebola
Crib so big, got a bitch in every corner
Joint smoke good 'cause I showed her how to roll it
In the morning, I got meetings with my lawyer
Arguments I'll never be a part of
Love pussy and some good conversation
And that money, we'll never see a shortage
Nigga run up on me, he gon' be a goner
Bruce Wayne whip, I got a new favorite bitch
I got a joint I just rolled that got a Liu Kang kick
I gotta do it big, that's just how I do things
Uh, 'cause a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right (Young nigga)
A young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right, yeah (You see me)
Don't get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga livin' right, yeah (Livin')
Bitches see me and start gettin' right
Because they know a nigga livin' right, uh (You see me)

My homie got the pistol and he might spazz out
Lifespan, motherfuckin' lifespan
That shit all depend on how tonight pan out
Ooh, I swear these hoes ain't right man
I left my shady bitch, I got a nice tan now
Red bandana in my right pocket
So if I pull the trigger, I can wipe that down
I just put my gun up in her Coach bag
I won't hesitate to pull it right back out
Life coach? I don't need no life coach
To coach me through my motherfuckin' ups and downs
Tell a bitch don't ask no questions
My money so old, I tell my new money "Respect your elders"
I'm startin' to get jealous of my own reflection
The young nigga sexy, a young nigga healthy
A young nigga flexin', I'm countin' my blessings
"Achoo," "God bless me," "Thank you," "You're welcome"
I talked to my Reverend, asked him if there’s a Heaven
A Heaven for a G, because me and my Gangstas
Done done it all, but never tell
He say "We already in Hell," I say "Ain't that a bitch?"
'Cause I work too hard, but still thankful as if this shit came as a gift
I just pray for my niggas that's out here still slangin' that shit
Keep my distance, I can't take that risk
I hope they understand
'Cause a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right (Livin')
Yeah, a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right, mmm (You see me)
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga livin' right, yeah (Livin')
Bitches see me and start gettin' right
Because they know a nigga livin' right, yeah (You see me)41Embed
