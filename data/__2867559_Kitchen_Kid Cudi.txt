72 ContributorsKitchen Lyrics
Hmm, you wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But it seems they all on the same mission
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But can't stand the heat of my love, then stay out the kitchen
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But it seems they all on the same mission
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But can't stand the heat of my love, then stay out the kitchen

Hmm, hmm, mi amour
Hmm, yeah, hmm, mi amour, hmm

You got me, got me
You, you got me, got me
Punch-Drunk Love annoyed
Hmm, you got me, got me
Hmm, you got me, got me
Punch-Drunk Love annoyed

Hmm, baby here we are, I made a wish on a shootin' star
Hmm, I ain't even mad at it, we made it this far
Hmm, baby here we are, I made a wish on a shootin' star
Hmm, I ain't even mad at it, we journeyed so far
Hmm, baby here we are, I made a wish on a shootin' star
Hmm, it would be so tragic if, we abandoned this bond, no
Mhmm, baby, we've journeyed too far, no U-turns my sweetheart
You might also like
Hmm, hmm, mi amour
Hmm, yeah, hmm, mi amour, hmm

You got me, got me
You, you got me, got me
Punch-Drunk Love annoyed
Hmm, you got me, got me
Hmm, you got me, got me
Punch-Drunk Love annoyed

You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But it seems they all on the same mission
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But can't stand the heat of my love, then stay out the kitchen
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But it seems they all on the same mission
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But can't stand the heat of my love, then stay out the kitchen

Hmm, hmm, mi amour
Hmm, yeah, hmm, mi amour, hmm
You got me, got me
You, you got me, got me
Punch-Drunk Love annoyed
Hmm, you got me, got me
Hmm, you got me, got me
