9 ContributorsDrugs Like You Lyrics
My name is Gucci
I drink lean
Take pills
Smoke weed
Aye man, its Gucci

I smoke a ounce of some shit I can't even pronounce
Since I can't say it right now Im just gone call it that loud
I think I'm Rick James I pass that shit to the crowd
I think I'm George Clinton because I'm high and I'm proud
I think I'm Michael Jackson my Dr. give me the scripts
I got my own Pharmacy yo prescription get filled
Who want a Percocet
Who want a Lortab
Who want some clean Molly
You want some Oxycontin
Oh you's a drug user
Man you know Gucci got it
They call me Gucci Google
If I don't got it find it
I got that raw Act
Eat up yo stomach lining
She got a titty ring
I got that nose candy
She eating Vicodin's back to back like they was Jolly Ranchers
And the Versace jeans she's wearing look like they body painted
She went to rehab
She bout to relapse
You know I lean and drive
Man I don't need cabs
I'm on the E way
I'm in a V-12
I got that Molly sand I'm on the beach with seashells
Ain't you a rapper Gucci
Why you got 3 scales
Man I don't e-mail
Gucci mail bales

What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man don't love her right
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man don't love her right
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
We in the club, we high off drugs tonight
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man don't love her right
We high off drugs tonight
(we high off drugs tonight)

We fucked up
One too many drugs got me fucked up
I got damn near 4 drugs all in one cup
Styrofoam cup it cost me like a hundred bucks
500 dollars every time I'm pourin' up
300 dollar blunts when I'm rollin' up
I spent 2500 hundred I ain't even had my lunch
OG kush so breakfast for a champion my morning junt
Promethazine on everything I'm pouring lean on my Captain Crunch
Last 12 months not sober once
Which one of y'all wanna have some fun
Get ya some numb ya tongue need a liver and lung
Playing the guitar high off the same shit that Jimi Hendrix on
Smoking Chronic me and Snoop Lion need to get ya some
Clean bricks I remix me some
Licks I done hit more than 1
Syrup I get drowned upon but then in the mob it's frowned upon
He said he on cloud 9 but I don't know what cloud I'm on
Its Gucci Mane the Rasta man someone please roll the ganja man
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man don't love her right
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man don't love her right
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
We in the club, we high off drugs tonight
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man don't love her right
We high off drugs tonight
(we high off drugs tonight)5Embed
