14 ContributorsInternational Lyrics
Eternally thug nigga Hilfiger, made by Tommy
So when I speak, hope to reach my Boricua mammies
Oh, come to poppy, I love it when it's wet and sloppy
In and out the mouthpiece, until I cum, no one can stop me
My bump 'n' grind'll do ya every time
Come get a blast of this thug passion, it'll blow your mind
Hey! Throw up your legs, wrap them shits around my back
It's a Westside thing, fuckin' hoes around the map
Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin' out hotties
And they, seduce my Jimmy, I'll be screamin', "Give me body"
Make 'em all scream my name out, give me my props
And don't ya, love how this thug nigga beat up the cop
I'm at the Rican parade, I'm watching caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas, bullshit ll never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black teen
I fiend for hoes cross country like a greedy crack fiend
Now c'mon

(Hey girl)
I can tell that you want it
By the way your dancing on the floor
(Hey girl)
By the look in your eyes
I can tell you want some more
(Oh girl)
Don't worry 'bout it, just keep doing what you do
(Hey girl)
Girl, tonight you can be
International

Okay, look, check it out
Nipsey, when I pull up to the club on them chrome things
I'm crispy, shining from my wrist to my gold chain
Anywhere I go, I keep it hood, I never change
If it ain't up on my lap, got it stashed in the Range
Bang, bang, I'm getting bread on the proper
Private jet, anywhere I tell him he gon' fly to
My respect had these girls saying, "Daddy I do
Anything you ask," get it crackin' when I slide through
As God as my witness, right hand on the bible
In Tokyo, honey turned it up, arigatou
Got stroked fa sho, now up in Atlanta in the strip club
She thick, cuz, took me to the SWATS, where the crib was
Went full throttle, got it crackin', I ain't bashful
From the kitchen to the countertop, in the bathroom
Flips mo', trips mo' stamps on my passport
Told her drop me off at Hartsville, I'm international

(Hey girl)
I can tell that you want it
By the way your dancing on the floor
(Hey girl)
By the look in your eyes
I can tell you want some more
(Oh girl)
Don't worry bout it just keep doing what you do
(Hey girl)
Girl tonight you can be
International
(Young Dre The Truth, Makaveli
LT Hutton, Nipsey)
(Ohh, International)
It's Mr. Hoodnational, rider with a passport
Just landed from Paris homie pick me up, I'm at the airport
With two bottles of Moet and a bottle of Port
Can we, get something poppin' 'cause tomorrow got court
So of course I'm ready to get it, feel it going down right now
Hopped in the whip, popped the bottle, lit a blunt right now
Did about a buck-fifty, seconds later, the party right now
We celebrating Makaveli - 2Pacalypse Now
Escape through the front door, they shootin' up on tippy toes
Cruisin' up to get the dough
If you lose a chick then let her go
She done chose, it's over, bro
Look around, it's Harleyville
Dimes in high heels came from Japan to go to Cali to chill
They choosin' for real with no grill in my dental
Peep, my swagger tremendous, make moves monumental
It was me, three mamis, E-40 and 'Pac
At the Le Mondrian after party, it just don't stop

(Hey girl)
(Ooh, riders)
I can tell that you want it
By the way your dancing on the floor
(Hey girl)
By the look in your eyes
I can tell you want some more
(Oh girl)
Don't worry bout it just keep doing what you do
(Hey girl)
Girl tonight you can be...International
(Ooh, rider's)5Embed
