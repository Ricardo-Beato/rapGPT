8 Contributors30 Bricks Lyrics
Zaytoven on the beat buddy
Gucci!
Gyeah!
So icy entertaiment baby
Poster boy
Gucci mane laflare
Back at it
Early in the morning
Its 9 in the morning
Gyeah!
Its gucci!
You know how we do this thang mane
Its about this time
So icy ceo speaking
Gucci Gucci!

Early in the morning its 9 in the morning
I will give a damn if you ain't cookin 
Workin my pot dawg
Heavy wrist activity
Block trust infinite
Pound trust limited
Before you bring the work
Please tell me what the ticket is
Twenty two five and a drought where the chicken is
Bustin down blocks sellin fat rocks
Me and eggbeater shwaty standin over pots
I´m a farmer seasoned dawg see im more like a 
 cocaine and crack and about six niggas
Swing the door swing the door
Search it down search it down
 boy you came from up town
You might also like
Gucci mane Im richer than a forbes
Everytime Im whippin mane its gourmet
Plane maker you can call me ervy
Got the washing powder ain’t talkin detergent

I got them collards green but gucci not a farmer
But you know I got them pounds of marijuana
In the smith double deuce is the number
30 bricks in my all white hummer
 quarter key gucci super recepie
Junkie they be spinning but really think they are scared of me
Just another nigga slanging crack rock
Kilos pounds gotta make a profit
I got money falling out my pocket
I smile cause I know the feds watching
Its gucci mane laflare you call me gucci
30 bricks I gotta comin Tuesday
I got 30 bricks so 20 more to go
Kick a door pimp a hoe anything that make it grow
I was in the junior high selling mix of mid grey
A hundred thousand pounds comin in tuesday

Gucci mane Im richer than a forbes
Everytime Im whippin mane its gourmet
Plane maker you can call me ervy
Got the washing powder ain't talkin detergentEmbed
