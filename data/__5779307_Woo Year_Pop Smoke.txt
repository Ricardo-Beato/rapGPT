(287, bruh, you got it) CashMoneyAP (Yeah)
(Fuck outta here) Talkin' whole new wave (Yeah), no cap (Yeah)
(Stop it) Yeah, ahaha (Kio)
Yeah

She fell in love with the bag
So designer
Yeah, she fell in love with the bag (Hahahaha)
Diamond cuts, oh

I'm up now, I'm up next
I traded the AP for Patek
Twenty years, movin' like a vet'
G4 when I hop on the jet
I bought the Richard Mille with baguettes
I empty the clip until it's nothing left
No ID, call collect
When you see me you know, I'm that nigga
She wanna hop on a plane with that nigga
She wanna go switch lanes with that nigga
She wanna skrrt, skrrt, skrrt with that nigga, oh
Take flights overseas, uh, I'm just by my breezy
Could care less 'bout the treeshas, paint her face, Mona Lisa
I sold that cocaina to buy them brand new sneakers
Hunnid K a feature, now I could fuck my teacher

She fell in love with the bag, uh
So designer
Yeah, she fell in love with the bag
Diamond cuts (Woo, woo), oh

She fell in love with the, she fell in love with the Woo (Woo)
She be down when it's me and my boo
Forever Pop, yeah, shake up the room (Woo)
Forever Pop, yeah, shake up the room
No hesitation, I'm pickin' up Choos (Uh, uh)
I keep the sticky, you know I'm the shooter
Dafi with me and he totin' the Ruger
She fell in love with the bag
She throwin' it back and I'm slappin' her ass
288 and I'm doin' the dash
Amiri, the denim, Louis V on my ass
Lil' treesha, my body (Racks), I'm smokin' the gas
I do what I want (Skrrt), had to skrrt from the class
Bad bitch treeshin', RJ hop out, leave 'em
Bend blocks, speedin' (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grrt-baow)
TG, bleedin', scannin', readin' (Scannin', scannin', readin', readin')

She fell in love with the bag, uh
So designer
Yeah, she fell in love with the bag
Diamond cuts (Woo, woo), oh4Embed
