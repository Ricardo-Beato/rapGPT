"This is the Rocket Powered Space Capsule. All systems are go."
And the story goes, a young man will come
And save the universe from the forces of evil

Take a second to adjust to the ride
They say if this was a crime, it'd be federal
Lately I've been feelin' invincible
As I'm tryna find my way, can't nothing hold me though
I say, get a clue, the vibes all around you
Try but you can't deny when it's in your soul
Let's take it where there aren't any roads
Where these sucka hatin' niggas can't follow, baby

Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride
No worries, no worries, no worries, no worries

Come on don't be shy, let your guard down and work it
Do just what you want, anything you choose
I tell ya, there's no way we could lose
Have you ever seen the Earth from this view? I bet not
You might also like
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride, take a ride, take a ride
And now, the vibes

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
All is life and all is pain
Down the hallway of my endless fate

Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride
Come on, yea
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride
Come on, yea
Come on, dream on
Come on, come on
Dream on, no worries
