41 ContributorsIn This House Lyrics
Actin' like they killers, but them niggas just some hoes
We act like this a studio, this really just a trap
Everything we got, we had to whip it out the bowl
Before we shake your hand, we'd rather slap you with the strap
A million cash in hunnids, now they bring it to the door (Racks)
20k for a coat that I ain't even wore
This bitch so bad, I let her shop, I made 'em close the store
She think she trickin' me, but bitch don't know my pockets swole (The money)
Big bankroll, top floor South Beach (Top)
Long money Gucci, ask your bitch 'bout me (Ask)
Penthouse suite, four hoes, two weeks
And all my shooters shootin; .223's 'bout me, Wop

Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga's nose sweaty
But all the ho shit still so smelly
Belch wrong, get your throat slashed
Nigga, broke ass, where's your cash?
Nigga, Santa Claus with no bag
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

(Whores in this house, there's some whores in this house)
(There's some whores in this house, there's some whores in this house)
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga
You might also like
Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga's nose sweaty
But all the ho shit still so smelly
Belch wrong, get your throat slashed
Nigga, broke ass, where's your cash?
Nigga, Santa Claus with no bag
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

Boy, you been a ho
I remember, ho
You ain't foolin' Weezy F, and that's for friend or foe
Tell them hoes in the house we kickin' in the door
He a ho and she a ho, now that's too many hoes

Boy you been a ho since Arsenio
Fuck your bitch, put her in the figure four
Scope on the gun, better visual
Silencer make the bullets tippy-toe
I don't give a fuck, never gave fucks
'Cause I always knew that a better day come
Haven't been asleep, seven day run
Never knew how a Chevrolet run
Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Ren, and Dre
I am the new NWA
Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
Take lives like students took lessons
Jail time, felt like it took seconds
I'm a Goodfella, was a dope seller
All these ho niggas must be Hochella
(There's some whores in this house, there's some whores in this house)
(There's some whores in this house, there's some whores in this house)
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
You a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga's nose sweaty
But all the ho shit still so smelly
Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga's nose sweaty
But all the ho shit still so smelly
Belch wrong, get your throat slashed
Nigga, broke ass, where's your cash?
Nigga, Santa Claus with no bag
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

No bullshit, my nigga
I'm pushin' my triggers
They lookin' for niggas in bushes, my nigga
In the ocean, in the lake, in the woods, in the rivers
The skies was gray and the bullets was silver
Young Money on front of my hoodie, my nigga
You front on your money, you couldnâ€™t, my nigga
We kill you by breakfast and cook you for dinner
The lesbians say you a pussy-ass nigga, ol' ho-ass nigga
I put some pressure on your ho
Make her tell me what she know
Stop confessin' to that ho
Stop confidin' in that ho
Stop providin' for that ho
You gon' die for that ho
Suicide for that ho
Boy, you been a ho
I remember, ho
You ain't foolin' Weezy F, and that's for friend or foe
Tell them hoes in the house we kickin' in the door
He a ho and she a ho, now that's too many hoes

Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga's nose sweaty
But all the ho shit still so smelly
Belch wrong, get your throat slashed
Nigga, broke ass, where's your cash?
Nigga, Santa Claus with no bag
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

Boy, you been a ho
I remember, ho
You ain't foolin' Weezy F, and that's for friend or foe
Tell them hoes in the house we kickin' in the door
He a ho and she a ho, now that's too many hoes
(There's some whores in this house)8Embed
