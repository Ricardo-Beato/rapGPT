Yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

When the strap out, you know what that 'bout
We do it my way, cause a crime wave
Woah – wave – woah – wave
I wave the heat to eat, waive my right to speak
Plead the fifth y'all, don’t tell 'em shit y'all
Woah – wave – woah – wave

I'm not telling you to shoot somebody
But if somebody try to shoot you, shoot 'em
Don't waste time, little nigga, just do it
Any nigga out of order must be serviced
See now, now you hesitating, boy, you making me nervous
The Feds know I clap heat, felonies on my rap sheet
Front on me, try to run from me, hollows heat up your back, B
Pistol pop, copper top, burn, baby, burn
Revolver spin again and again and niggas never learn
Got a itchy itchy itchy itchy trigger finger, nigga
So if you hit me and you get me, I'll be back to get ya
Man I might bring the homies in that's if it's necessary
See, you might not be worried, but I think you should worry
Them bullets come in flurries, next thing you know, you're buried
Yeah, I do away with nine niggas in nine days
My nine sprays when shit don't go my way
Hold it sideways, fuck around, cause a crime wave
You might also like
When the strap out, you know what that 'bout
We do it my way, cause a crime wave
Woah – wave – woah – wave
I wave the heat to eat, waive my right to speak
Plead the fifth y'all, don’t tell 'em shit y'all
Woah – wave – woah – wave

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

I talk about my arsenal, I rap about my infantry
Them crackers they be scared of me, the hood man, they into me
Yeah, I'm #1 on Forbes
Yeah, they can't fuck with your boy
Tax time is crack time, I flip that, get that back
Louie V. nap sack filled up with G-stacks
I'm sick in the head, me, I'm all 'bout the bread
Go 'head fuck with the kid, see it's just what I said
See the stash, I'm making double, making kilos bubble
Gem star, boy, I cut you til' your ma don't know you
See, when we play, them warriors come out to play
You wanna play? Get your ass laid out today
See, I'm back on the shit I was on before
So if a nigga try to stunt, we gon' take 'em to war
When the strap out, you know what that 'bout
We do it my way, cause a crime wave
Woah – wave – woah – wave
I wave the heat to eat, waive my right to speak
Plead the fifth y'all, don’t tell 'em shit y'all
Woah – wave – woah – wave

Man, I be on some other shit, these niggas can't fuck with me
Yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The homie said he fuck with me, I have him hit you up for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah2Embed
