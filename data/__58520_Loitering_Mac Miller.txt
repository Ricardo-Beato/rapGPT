Cam Erlim, is that it?
Oh no, Cam Rellim, haha
Cam Rellim at your service, with these verses

Ayo, I'm park bench chillin', burger patty grillin'
Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin
Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell him come and bring a meal in
My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim
Way above the buildin', bungee jumpin' down
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign
Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap
Give a fuck 'bout what you sayin' after platinum-plated plaques
Take it back, cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything all factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call it Adderall
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work
Black shirt, Rellim Cam, that's my name said backwards
Ask first, hell nah, treat 'em like a bellhop
Let 'em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy

I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swings (At the swings)
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthafucker, stay down
Girl, I'll be waitin' at the swings (Hey) (At the swings)
You might also like
Ayo, I'm Blue Park slidin', go-cart drivin'
Got this rap shit down to a science
My Louis belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance
Is just a muthafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big
No, that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito
Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert De Niro
I be low, key though, young nino with my jeans low, heh
Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go *Woman moans*
You can hear the way she's moanin'
Started back at midnight, at it 'til the mornin'
Wake up with some mornin' wood
Hit it before work, yeah, I'm sure she would
All my female fans like, "I'm sure it's good," haha

I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swings (At the swings)
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthafucker, stay down
Girl, I'll be waitin' at the swings (At the swings)2Embed
