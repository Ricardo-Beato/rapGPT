35 ContributorsDesperado Lyrics
Yeah, you know what it is, it's Hot 97
My name is Peter Rosenberg, and, uh
We're gonna get to some new music right now
This is a record called "Desperado"
Okay, by my girl, Azealia Banks
Man, I've been waiting for Azealia Banks
Waiting for Azealia Banks
Waiting for Azealia Banks

(Desperado)
Up's and ups, seductive pup
Flux - did a dip, pack up then strut
Up’s nigga, w-what’s up nigga?
With that buck, can i get that rrr-rompin’ uh?!
Mutts in tux, deluxe and such
I be in the mirror lookin' Luxe N Plush
Looks and such, seductive strut
I be Aquafizzy or that Passion Punch
Or the Fashions Munch, but the fabric’s lush
You don't get the access; none
Spun him on my axis - Sun
Hit him with the hazard, hun
Denim and a satin rump
Blend it with the carrot blush
Plus I got the cash and the bass have you spazzin' some
Come get your limps in bum
Dinner with the princess one
Printed in expensive funds
You might also like
Hey, yo!
That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Hey, yo!
That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!

I be pretty, prissy, plenty plush and stuff
You be piggy-pissy, penny-crushed and crunched
Crust and dust, slumped and jumped
Queen scissor-cut suit, other's not trump
Giddy up, this buck - titty tuck, no such
I be freaky frizzy in the front and up
You be very sleazy lady-lump hip-strut
Betty-bump this bun, parrrump-pun-dun

Hey, yo!
That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Hey, yo!
That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Hey, yo!
That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Hey, yo!
That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Hey, yo!
Desperado!
Hey, yo!
Desperado!
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed
Please, check the number, and dial again
And dial again
And dial again
And dial again

Desperado!
Desperado!
Hey, yo!
That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Hey, yo!
That's how I do my thing!
Desperado!
Hey, yo!

Hit 'em with that acid tongue
Venom in that Python Pump
Bet he hunt this hun
Here the huntress come
Get amongst this one
If the freaky function fun
I could be the perfect one
Splurgin' on the purchase, yum
Mergin' on the purpose, won
When the verse is spun, I'ma Hertz this
Can't-can't rehearse this, none
This is 147th street
Next is 157th
Desperado!25Embed
