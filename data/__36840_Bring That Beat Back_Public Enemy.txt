YEAH ,YEAH ,YEAH
FLavor Flav, back in your face with a hot track, boy
BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!
AWWW WWEEE
BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!

See, I played in Cincinatti with my whole head nappy
Made a Rally in the street, with nothing but a beat
Got a grudge against the judge, kicked him out that seat
You are what you eat, yes.. so what you're eating?
Same message to your mind be.. self defeating
Sick and tired of being sick, and tired of being beaten
So I'mma drop it, like it was way too hot
And too fast (COME ON!!) for Hip-Hop, Doo Wop, Rock or Bop
I ain't here to hurt you, I don't hang in them circles
The government ain't got me yet, so y'all don't stop me
See the stampede of fake cats, running from Bill Cosby
What does he got to do with you doing you?, Y'all know what?
DJ Lord give me that cut, bring that beat back (Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo)
Yeah, that's what's up, bring that beat back
COME ON!!, that's what's up
BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!
BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!

To the beat y'all
Bring that beat back (N.W.A. Posse)
The beat y'all
BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!
BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!

Feedback from truely freed blacks
Got to think outside this Box of hard knocks
Signed them up at Fort Knox
They die in Iraq, what?.. you don't know I rock?
What?.. you under a rock? What?.. you under a rock? (GET IT!!)
Old cats begging us to bring that beat back
Each generation be thinking that the next one is whack
Jump started in the daze of crack
R&B Reagan, Daddy Bush, 1980s, got to come on back
(HIT THE BEAT BACK!!)
I pray to God, I feel like I've got a church in myself
Good God uhh.. I can't get no help
I say again health care cut back and it's whack
Yeah Ab.. bring that beat back, COME ON!!

The beat y'all
YEAH!! (Chuck D)
To the beat y'all
Bring that beat back ( N.W.A. Posse)
 To Cristal Blair
The beat y'all
 To Cristal Clinton
DON'T YOU SAY THAT!!
BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!
They say: the youth don't matter and the old don't mind
It takes a lot of spines.. to build all them young minds
Some of us get ghetto at the wrong damn time
Album what?.. we're just making one at a time
To save another brother whose life on the line
A big.. shot to claim, some rocks, some shines
Signs of a soul, gone solo, robbed blind
A very small part of half the world's crime
Runaway.. child blown by an old land mine
Little ones.. still working in them Diamond mines
So cats can say.. What's hers and what's mines?
Diamonds is a girl's best friend; so why is he crying?
Yo Ab, why the hell is he crying?
Yeah, BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!

To beat y'all, to the beat y'all
The beat y'all, to the beat y'all, COME ON!!
Listen to this, listen to this..
Listen, listen to this, listen to this..
Listen to this, listen to this..
Listen, listen to this, listen to this..
For all you MCs in a crew
I said for all you MCs in a crew
I said for all you MCs in a crew
This is what we want y'all to do..
See, when y'all hear it, get near it
And you recognize the lyrics, you trained to refrain
And you.. start to fear it as escapism
Yeah, like today there ain't no racism
Obviously, y'all ain't seen black folks on TV
Judgement calls made on behalf of you and me
Or you and I, do or die, I say an eye for an eye
Dividing line; got the poor people paying for crime
Corprorations getting paid off our Jail time
Now, y'all can tell Russell, yes, I knock the hustle
(LOOK OUT!!) Cause two million in lockdown, under the federal muscle
Beyond the streets; these kids is always watching
Watching some of these jerks when they go berserk
So I work (AWWW WEEEE) DJ Lord give me that cut
Bring that beat back, yeah.. and that's what's up
DJ Lord bring that beat back
Yo Ab (BEAT THE DRUMS!!) bring that beat back
Bring that beat back, yeah, COME ON NOW!!

The beat y'all
To the beat y'all
YEAH!!(Chuck D)
The beat y'all
COME ON!!(Chuck D)
To the beat y'all
The beat y'all, to the beat y'all
The beat y'all, the beat y'all
BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!
BRING THAT BEAT BACK!!
Sort of Wu-Tang
To the beat y'all
Bring that beat back (N.W.A. Posse)
The beat y'all
Bring that beat back (N.W.A. Posse)
To the beat y'all, the beat y'all

Get down.. get down..Embed
