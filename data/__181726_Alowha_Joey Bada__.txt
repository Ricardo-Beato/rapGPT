71 ContributorsAlowha Lyrics
Make Some Noise
And the champion
Reigning that is
From Flatbush, Brooklyn

You are now listening to...
Ladies and gentlemans, boys and girls
All to float this poison in this world
Arhg yeah ! We back !
Kirk Knight on the beat, Brooklyn
Have a safe summer
Pro Era, we are here
Rest in peace my nigga Steez, this is for you
Summer Knights
My nigga og swink in this bitch
I know what's more still going nigga
Chuck S you know who I am
Bitchies, I see y'all outta here in summer, take times all that shit
Yea.. back in this muthafucka
Reportin' live from a lyrical high
One time

Yo, with not a damn thing on my mind but this rhyme
And a matter of time to make this whole shit align
Like I planned out, nothing in life gets handout
Just stand out, ever since I hit the pot my vision panned out
Pressure boil 'til I'm fanned out, now we the popular band
So they can't keep their hands off of the man now
Invite 'em in, give 'em that S vitamin, baby Cham style
Got some Trini girl to soak it up, ShamWow!
Damn, child, you're killin 'em
Fillin' 'em, drillin' 'em with serums of pure noradrenaline
High blood feelin' like the thermostat cracked, left mercury spillin'
Your favorite rapper tryna earn stacks from nursery children
True emcees write a verse and rehearse it a million times
Just for the rebirth of a feelin' prime and golden
Shawty ask what I'm holdin', teasin' 'em
Know when the magnum blast eye squeeze magnesium
Used to be mad premature, now I'm mad premium
From lookin' up to niggas, to lookin' up niggas
Meetin' 'em, meetings with 'em
Give 'em a high pitch like curveballs and helium
Young scorcher trying to evolve like Charmeleon
Million, yeah, nigga, we tryna get a million

Got the bomb nigga, Baghdad
I'm blown away from a bad pass
Walk on grass, below skunk, I smell sole funk in the stash
My SB's, antimony I never had
I was more arsenic, vaporize when I got heated
Never jealous, solid as a rock n' roll fo' planes
No propellers, just some Pro fellas, who you know better?
Never lost my groove, I don't know no Stella
It's a cold world without Coachella
A shady bunch, like under Interscope umbrella
But that don't phase me once, people say I'm crazy
But call me young Evel 'cause I crazy stunt
Amaze these punks, drop swank like it's knowledge to ya
Mr. Bada$$ is ya scholar's tutors
Swank the lord and hallelujah
Still praying to the Allahs, Gods and Judahs
Balance out my lows on a low high
Niggas ain't know I'm sitting so high
Balance out my lows on the low high
I'm like a low high

Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low
Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low
Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low
Leave 'em with no direction to go
Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low
Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low
Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low
Direct-less Indigos
Yeah nigga straight Bagdad From Flatbush...Brooklyn
One time
It's Beastcoast shit
Balance out my lows on a low high
Pro Era
Niggas ain't know I'm sitting so high
Rest low high16Embed
