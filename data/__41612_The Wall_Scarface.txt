9 ContributorsThe Wall Lyrics
So Brad, tell me what's going on in your world?

It's fucked up, I'm looking at myself in the mirror
I'm seeing something scary; it's blurry, make it clearer
I got a funny feeling that today will be the day
That someone tries to blow my motherfucking ass away, hey
I did some wrong In My Time of Dying but
I never felt the nerve to make the motherfucking final cut
I've been depressed for no fucking reason
But every problem's got a reason; I'm kinda having trouble breathing
Somebody help me, hear my plead, my battle cry
My psychic told me, it's gonna be hard for Brad to die
She told a lie; I think I oughta shoot the bitch
I got my pistol, thinking if I should shoot the shit
Click, bang, I jammed it, I slammed it
Aw shit, goddammit!
I'm having a fucked up day to begin with
I lost a bitch, a bird, and then this
My homies tend to think I get too high
I'm doing fine, now pass me the formaldehyde
The only thing that seems to help me cope
Is when I'm drunker than a motherfucker puffin' on the chronic smoke
And then I'm able to deal with the woes
The friends, the foes, the bitches, the hoes
I gotta gang of niggas, and none of them I'd fuck
I gotta gang of bitches, and none of them I'd trust
Trust a bitch, nope, uh-uh, never
I'm having enough trouble trying to keep my damn self together
They got me by the balls
So please, help me break these motherfucking...
{*pause*} .. these motherfucking walls
You might also like
I scream...there's no one there that seen me cry
I guess it's hard to scream to motherfuckers when you scream inside
I'm staring at my future, it's in plain view
I blame myself, but, Mommy dear, I blame you
'Cause now I'm finally looking at the picture
My daddy shoulda quit ya, right before he hit ya
Or swung it to the left instead
And left a big-ass stain in the fucking bed.
Because the world was fucked from the first
And having me only made the matters worse
Now look at what they did to me
That's some fucked up shit for a kid to see
Motherfuckin villain after villain, killin after killin
I'm tryin' to check a million
Damn, I'm going straight to fuckin satan
A fucking shame...about to blow my fucking brains

Shit, damn I'm dead
I'm finally through with hearing these voices in my head
Somebody finally got me
I'm looking at myself outside of my fucking body
So now I'm standing face to face
Mr. Scarface, versus Mr. Scarface
We were two different people from the start
One nigga's too smart the other too fucking hard
And both refused to be outsmarted
Dearly departed, the battle's already started
Fuck it, it's on, I swung, I duck, I weave, connect, I'm struck
Caught me with the piercing lead
And realized to myself, I shot my own fucking self!
Damn, suicide is quicker
I try to break the wall, the wall keeps getting thicker
I really start to miss my mother
I'm trying to climb the wall, it's higher than a motherfucker
And hollow's what the sound is
I'm having major problems trying to walk around it
And ain't no getting out; I'm trapped
I really should've dropped my motherfucking strap
'Cause when I think about it now
I didn't have to climb the motherfucker
{*pause*}...I shoulda broke the motherfucker downEmbed
