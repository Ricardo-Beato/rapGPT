11 ContributorsDreaminâ€™ Lyrics
How to put it together?
How to say it right
Yo, yo, Ralo
Han, look

I'm like
Follow my steps, and you see what I'm bout
I keep that money coming in and never going out
You wanna fuck a fly nigga that you heard about
I beat that pussy up until it's watered down
She call me once a day to see if I'm around
But 9 times out of 10 I'm probably out of town
I told you ease up you more persistent now
I'm fronting though cuz if you stopped I'd probably miss the sound
Somewhere in between us it's attraction and I see that
You make me wanna make you tat my name up on your cleavage
I know it's just a song but when it stop I'm still gon' mean it
Sent your picture to my ex, told her this is why I'm leaving look
Couple stacks in my pocket and I'm fiending
To down a glass of Reisling and go blow it at Neiman's
Hop in the coupe I know that ass will fill my seats in
Something decent then ride to the remix
Han, Hussle

How to put it together?
How to say it right

Now I was driving down Wilshire
Just left the label
Lit my Swisher Sweet then we made a left on Rodeo
Life is beautiful if I might say so
I live it unrestricted, it ain't a place that I can't go
Gyu Kaku, hot shots and cold fish
Pints of dolce and coconut Ciroc fifths
Living drama free, Roosevelt cabana suites
TMZ questions me about my strands of weed
I like to vacation on Miami beach
Couple homies from the set, some Atlanta freaks
Used to have them pounds cheap in 2003
Most of the niggas from back then in penitentiaries
And now they see me on they TV like "how can it be?"
It's complicated how I made it like Avril Lavigne
That's why they rooting for me, I'm speaking what they think
Without no pieces I could show you how to build a dream
Hussle, Hussle, Hussle
