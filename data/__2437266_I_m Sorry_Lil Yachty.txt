31 ContributorsIâ€™m Sorry Lyrics
I'm sorry
Yeah, I'm sorry
'Cause I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
I didn't know, baby, I didn't know

Alright, I admit it
I fucked up this time, yeah, I did it
Always arguing cause you a critic
But this time, this time
Yeah, I said the wrong line
Wish I could rewind
Want to take you out, fine dine
Want to make you my dime
Ayy, ayy

'Cause I'm sorry
I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
No I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
I'm sorry
You might also like
Tell me where you going
Probably somewhere out there hoeing
I'm always quick to judge, yeah, I know it
But this time, this time
I sure caught you slipping this time
Wish I didn't have these thoughts on my mind
But I did some time, oh, what do I do
Oh, that's your brother, not your nigga, baby, I didn't know

I'm sorry
'Cause I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
Yeah, I didn't know, baby, I didn't know

I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry
I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
I thought I knew but now I know
I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry1Embed
