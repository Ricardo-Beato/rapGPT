Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world

Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball

Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the worldYou might also like1Embed
