(Oh my God, what is this? An L beat?)
Free Uzi, yeah
(This an L beat, oh)

Yeah, I remember when that girl didn't need me
I didn’t have no money, and I couldn't find out what's the reason (Why?)
Now that ho back on my team, ’cause my neck wet like a squeegee (Woah)
We served them packs in the net, we get them racks like Serena, uh (Woo)
Yeah, the sun out, so my boys gonna trap today
When you get money every day like Saturday (Woo)
Nigga's lyin', yeah, he stuck with a cappin' face
Niggas rattin', they get hit with the MAC today (Woo)
This my I-don't-even-know-um-what-happened face
Grandma in the kitchen still singin' "Happy Days" (Yeah)
I just popped a G6, I'm in my happy place
She was trippin’, had to ask her, "What Perc’ you take?" (Let's go!)

I can make your lil’ bitch just wanna percolate
Sex first, then we can have a after-date (Yeah)
Gave me head 'til my shit, um, decapitate
Look me in my eye and do, um, that nasty face (Woah)
Make it rain in the club, like a nasty day
Told 'em that I'm comin’, oh, no ejaculate
Pastry, pocket, boy, you not havin' cake
Fuck that overcoat, and I swear your jacket late
Bro just made his money back off a half a plate
Rollie cost me forty thousand, that's half the face (Let's go)
I remember when them niggas all laughed at me
Portfolios, now they all bring they apps to me
Wish before me that my bitch practiced abstinence
Wishes don't come true until you just practice it
Niggas broke? Never, ho, bitch, we havin' it
Yes, we spendin' it, but you know we stackin' it (Let's go)
You might also like
I was steppin' on the beat, took a nap on it
If she shake her ass, you know I'm gon' slap on it
She was suckin' my dick right on her knees
Her mama bust in, she said, "Girl, what is happenin'?"
She said, "Baby, you know your dad a panther?"
She said, "Mama, I'm just doin' the Kaepernick"
Frito-Lay, yeah, you know that I'm stackin' chips
Got a tattooed face so you can't see my blasphemy
It's some niggas that really just wan' blast at me
But you know I got some niggas that blast for me
I'm not tall, but I ball like a athlete
Count my money, yeah, I turn to a mathlete
Had to get my business together (Yup)
I had three million in taxes (I did)
I got it all off on this level (Yup)
They said it's three million that's missin'
I ain't say nothin', I stayed level (Ooh)
Couple dolls on me, say, "Hey, yellow"
This that my-money-gon'-stay level (Ooh)
I don't give a fuck, I'ma stay rebel (Yup)
Backwood on me, bitch, you stay 'rello (What else?)
I got my metal, so stay mellow
Got them boulders, my neck won't see a pebble (Uh)

I can make your lil' bitch just wanna percolate
Sex first, then we can have a after-date (Yeah)
Gave me head 'til my shit, um, decapitate
Look me in my eye and do, um, that nasty face (Woah)
Make it rain in the club, like a nasty day
Told 'em that I'm comin', oh, no ejaculate
Pastry, pocket, boy, you not havin' cake
Fuck that overcoat, and I swear your jacket late
Bro just made his money back off a half a plate
Rollie cost me forty thousand, that's half the face (Let's go)
I remember when them niggas all laughed at me
Portfolios, now they all bring they apps to me
Wish before me that my bitch practiced abstinence
Wishes don't come true until you just practice it
Niggas broke? Never, ho, bitch, we havin' it
Yes, we spendin' it, but you know we stackin' it (Let's go)
Foreign car, make your bitch wanna hop in it (Skrrt)
Don't know my name, but she start givin' top in it
Lil Uzi make these bitches wan' flock in it
Wonton, flood the block with some Wock' in it
They saw us comin', so they all just start hop the fence
Gangway, yeah, you know you get shot in it
Alexander Wang, bitch, I came from poverty
Got a plug, bring that shit right from Providence
Kill a opp, now my boys gonna hibernate
Sike, nah, they back on it the next day
The reason he died 'cause that boy gon' hesitate
Nigga, you started this shit, I'm just, "Let's play"
She suck on my dick 'til that bitch gon' regurgitate
She tellin' you that she never even heard of me
I can't trust none of these niggas, might turn on me
I'm still a millionaire, this shit not hurtin' me (Woah)
But it's hurtin' you (Yeah)
And I know the truth
I still watch Big Bang Theory, that's the nerd in me
I remember when your ass was just swervin' me
Please keep that same energy with the urgency
I'm liftin' these big ol' stacks like my name Hercules
Bulletproof on my tank, that's my insurgency
These old niggas wan' rob me like a burglary (Let's go)
I can make your lil' bitch just wanna percolate
Sex first, then we can have a after-date (Free Uzi)
Gave me head 'til my shit, um, decapitate
Look me in my eye and do, um, that nasty face (Free Uzi)
Make it rain in the club, like a nasty day
Told 'em that I'm comin', oh, no ejaculate (Yeah)
Pastry, pocket, boy, you not havin' cake
Fuck that overcoat, and I swear your jacket late
Bro just made his money back off a half a plate
Rollie cost me forty thousand, that's half the face (Let's go)
I remember when them niggas all laughed at me
Portfolios, now they all bring they apps to me
Wish before me that my bitch practiced abstinence
Wishes don't come true until you just practice it
Niggas broke? Never, ho, bitch, we havin' it
Yes, we spendin' it, but you know we stackin' it
