22 ContributorsKOWP Lyrics
I could drive a car through a fence
Bonnie sitting shotty, not Barbie and Ken
Probably dip instead of weathering your whims and woes
The piss and moan, I prefer sticks and stones
From the unrelenting filigree of digital Rome
I throw a signal fit to eclipse videodrome
More than pics of your pets, every pixel explodes
And viewership has an emotional and physical toll
I'm a 8-bit invader who vacate the cartridge
Upgrade, now I make waves in the lawless
Y'all still decorate a office in rainbows and dolphins
Basically awake in a coffin
Hmm, Chrissy tattooed his middle finger
Took from his mother, tools from his headshrinker
Duck a death-bringer, ain't bringing me shit
I'm right here, bitch, swing and a miss, hiss

Speak from a circle of seats
Each get a turn, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace
W— W— W— W— World peace
Teach 'em how to curse at police
And flee from the church, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace
W— W— W— W— World peace

Map of the dungeon
Pack drugs, I'm a rat to a button
Ask any kinda bad you can summon
I run through Brads like paper bag puppets
Bub, my dice got so many sides
In no time, you could throw 'em 'til you owe me your life
Throw forever, never once see the same roll twice
It's no joke, I don't know the snake oil price
I'm a strange force hailing from the wholly unknown
I tell a Category 5 he need to go to his room
I probably hang from a helicopter more than I need
Although, I guess it tells you what I thought of the scene
I meant to tell you when you talk I feel lost at sea
I feel like you're embalming me
Come and get a sense of the bubble
Couch on the left, but the rest is a puzzle, yeah

Staring down certain defeat
Reach for dessert, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace
W— W— W— W— World peace
Barring any personal beefs
And weeks I'm a jerk, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace
W— W— W— W— World peace
I like bones and old cassette tapes
I skip stones that go for ten days
I rid stones of the most stuck swords
"Go Back" signage over the front door
Robot dogs patrol the whole grounds
Crater in the lawn where last troll cowered
Not in the race to pass go
I'm a lone photon escaping a black hole
Truth told, never had an eye on the crown
I just jump through the glass every time I go out
Here to offer an experience your media can't
If you down to get your deep seats deprogrammed
I mean, the dude may sleep in a van
But, like, the food chain eat from his hand
I'm a backstreet butcher, bullshit wizard
Even in the summer, I'm a wolf in the winter, ayy

Creep in, burn the machine
Leave in a blur, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace
W— W— W— W— World peace
Might go berserk in the street
Cheap fireworks, I'm the king of world peace
W— W— World peace
W— W— W— W— World peace2Embed
