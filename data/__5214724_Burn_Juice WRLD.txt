(If young Metro don't trust you— trust you)

I can't take one Percocet, start tonight off, I just took a 60
Burberry on me, shoot you in your back, you just got Pretty Ricky
I tie the Chanel runners, then I get back to running the city
And I know that it's hell coming, I ain't worried, my niggas, they with me
Gotta put the narcotics down, I can feel 'em fucking up my kidney
And punching my liver
If I let it kill me, my mama'll never forgive me
Ain't numbing my feelings, if I let it kill 'em, my baby will never forgive me
This remind me of hell, sometimes I wonder if that's where God really sent me

Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn

The truth hurts, let it bleed out, if they hurt you, let 'em leave
My heart hurtin', let me bleed out, only way I'll find peace
I'm tryna get set free, but these chains on me
Choke me, I can't breathe, what's reality?
Uh, detached from myself
Uh-huh, numb the pain with my wealth
Uh, a bag from Chanel match the double C on my belt, uh
Bands in my pants, I barely be holdin' my pants up
But the money ain't the answer
I'm just tryna reach some new highs
Mix this with that, bet it feel nice
Codeine, only sip if I got ice
Look my girl in her eyes, tell her I won't die
I fell asleep too deep that one time
Woke up to your cry, girl, I'm fine
But I lied
Had a dream, I wasn't gon' wake up this time

Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn140Embed
