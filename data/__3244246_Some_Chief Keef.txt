Everything in the dark comes to light (Huh?)
Pull up in my car, hop out feeling right (Skrrt, skrrt, yeah)
Niggas ain't right, let me live my life (Live my life, hell nah)
'Fore I pull this pistol out and end your life (Bang, bang, bang)
She said she wanna have fun, but I wanna have funds (Funds, ftftft, beep)
If it's about that money, you know I wanna have some (Yeah)
Just seen the judge, still ride with guns (Skrrt)
Just got some money still gotta get some (Ftftft, beep, ftftft, beep)

Just seen the plug so I'm ridin' with pounds (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
If it's about that money, you know I'm down to get down (Yeah, ayy, ayy)
Just seen mama, hit her with 10 thousand (My mother)
I tote her this money, go on, go ride around (Just for ya)
Zero to one-thousand, I'ma make it count (Make it count)
If I gotta go public houses and break it down (Break it down)
Youngins see ya with that money, they gon' take you down (Take you down, where it's at?)
Come out with them pistols up and lay you down (Lay you down)
Pull up on your block and knock it down (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, bang, bang)
Where your coke, boy? You know my chopper down (Duhduhduh, bang, bang)
I just hit these streets and lock it down (Yeah, gang, gang)
Can't no locksmith unlock it now (Hell nah)
Block party, pull up, pop it down (Bang)
These niggas already know how I get down (Yeah, ayy, ayy)
