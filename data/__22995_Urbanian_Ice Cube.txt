6 ContributorsUrbanian Lyrics
Google me bitch
I told her, won'tcha Google me bitch
Ha ha, ah won'tcha
Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, yeah
I told her, won'tcha Google me bitch
Try to Google me bitch, listen

I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian
Fuck with the kid, and I'll turn, into Damien
Google me bitch, wanna know, what my name is
Don't even ask, stupid ass, am I famous

(Are you famous?) My resume is heaven's way
Of tellin y'all that God will make a way
I rock a motherfuckin mic 'til the break of day
Darrell Dawkins flow, y'all need to make a breakaway
Microphone fiend with that guillotine killer team
You motherfuckers won't amount to a hill of beans
When I ride by, well over 35
Y'all still run and hide, scared of a driveby

I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian
Google me bitch, wanna know, what my name is
I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian
Google me bitch, wanna know, if I'm famous
Google me bitch, ah won'tcha
Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, ah won'tcha
Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, I told her
Won'tcha Google me bitch, try to Google me this
You might also like
I'm urban, and ordained
Your little ass is kind of churban, and propane
Your little flame is like a flicker
And my bang, is off the motherfuckin Richter
I'm hard liquor
Cirrohsis of the liver
Black lung is what I deliver
That's what you get, if you ever try to smoke the nigga
Don't provoke a nigga, I'm from that urban community
Lookin for some unity, fuckin you and me
I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?
Nothin, I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?
