14 ContributorsAll That Glitters Lyrics
We are anonymous
Yeah
Some- this...
This is one of them joints, man
Uh

You ever have a bad dream?
Wake up and it's a sad thing
Paint a picture vivid, no flat screen
Gotta get the cash, C.R.E.A.M
Bright lights, see the flash beams
Life's a movie, better know that scene (haha)
Because I'm the leading actor of these fetus rappers
They all my sons, I gotta breed them faster
I'm undefeated for several reasons, I bring disaster
We need to see the pastor
With decency and laughter
They doubt I beat the chatter
But one day I'm gon' find myself
And I'ma do this shit by myself
But we gon' be straight, give me three days
I'll make a rhyme for pete's sake
Eat lobster and cheesecake
With vodka and cheap Bape
But we gon' get it, and get it again
Different Benz, same friends
I'm committed to win
It's no more lame trends
We is finished with them
And all the hater get a kick in the shin
But we don't fuck with that
Remember time was simple in tenth grade with bucket hats?
Pride gun, I tuck it back
Life crazy, my luck gets bad
Well I'ma say to you
We gon' make it through
And 'til the rain go away, I'm gon' play it cool
You might also like
Cause we all know how it goes
I know it's bad so let me tell you about it
All that glitters ain't gold
Life here's so sad, I seen hell around it

The hex or a spell around it
I'm humble, they tell I'm grounded
They shoot and there's shells around it
Trump and them bell has sounded
The end in times, will we burn for sins and crimes?
Spared for giving spares and shared beginning rhymes
But this is nowhere near the end, though
Miss Dave on the back porch smoking indo
Playing that Nintendo
Chilling with the kin folk
Everything A-OK like 10-4
But times done got harder
And we done got tougher
I didn't anticipate it
But shit's a lot rougher
But how can you thrive and succeed but not suffer?
The struggle make you real and the nigga got gutter
But soon straight steaks on my plate, hot butter
And everything gonna open up, stop clutter
So I'ma tell you, "Slow your roll, stand tall, don't fold
And everything that glitters ain't gold"
But you should
Cause we all know how it goes
I know it's bad so let me tell you about it
All that glitters ain't gold
Life here's so sad, I seen hell around it

I mean...
You just gotta bounce back from all your L's and come ten time harder. You can't do all the shit you can't change, right?2Embed
