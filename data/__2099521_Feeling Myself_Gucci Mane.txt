Gangsta Grillz
Affiliates nigga, pay attention
It's Gucci Mane, it's Gucci power
It's Gucci Mane, Gucci world, man
Shawty Redd on the track, know what I'm talkin' 'bout (South of Bouldercrest, yeah)
We back at it (Shawty)
Shawty, man (Shawty, ayy, Wop, what's happenin'?)
What's happenin'? Cut the beat down, man, know what I'm talkin' 'bout (Come on with it)

I got juice like bishop (Juice), paint pretty like richard (Sheesh)
I'm with **** like Emit Game, Antoine Fisher (Nah)
And I am legend just like Fresh Prince (I am legend, Gangsta Grillz)
But if you Will Smith, I'm Braveheart Mel Gibson (Huh?)
I'm Samuel Jackson 'cause I think it's time to kill 'em (Yeah)
The right wrist Diddy but my left wrist 50 (Burr, burr, burr, burr)
I'm livin' like Pac but I'm spittin' like Biggie (Huh, huh?)
A shoutout to Aaliyah 'cause her voice was so pretty (Gangsta Grillz, R.I.P.)
I say what? I feel like Pimp C did it (R.I.P.)
Gucci Tarantino or just call me Young Quentin (Quentin)
Or Gucci Nicholas Cage, I take your girl in sixty seconds (Phew, phew)
Or Gucci Mane Travolta Davin's doin' the slow dancin' (Huh?)
Call me So Icy Ventura, got ya laughing (Ha, ha, ha)
Keep dough like Homer, she suck it like Maggie (Dough)
I got donk beat in my trunk so the police start trippin' (Burr, burr, burr)
Sir, I'm not drag racing, I just have a large engine (Vroom)

A million dollars hid right in fifteen minutes (Fifteen)
Cash the damn check, copped two hard-top Bentleys (Uh)
A quarter million gone just fifteen seconds (Gangsta Grillz, well damn)

It's a blowout, no problem, bricks, I still slam dunk 'em (Dunk)
I make it 360 soon as I double pump it (Pump it)
Got a silver sniper rifle so I really shoot a jumper (Shoot a jumper)
Cross your game up, dawg, take it to the bucket (Swish)

See my hummer hold a hundred bills, stash the forty (Forty)
