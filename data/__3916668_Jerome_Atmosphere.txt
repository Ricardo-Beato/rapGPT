9 ContributorsJerome Lyrics
I ain't the one
I never was the one, just another son of a son of a gun
Grandpa had the skin of a drum
Ru-ru-run but you can't escape what you came from
Bite your tounge, chew blood like it's gum
Climb aboard the diving board, time gets shorter when a child is born
I'm a quiet storm, but when I'm dry and warm, I take final form until you slice the chord
And make the line go flat on that life support
I gotta make some space so I can reach these stars
My face looks like an old race car, tryin' to put it together before it came apart
And when they lay my parts where my name is carved, they should save my heart in this mason jar
Minnesota, Uber drivers, Google Maps to the universal fibers
You're nobody 'til you stole some lighters, cat burglar disguised as a nervous tiger
We've been to many places but earth is liver
Save it, give me likes and favorites
Everybody's famous, I'ma need a lifetime of patience
Remind me what your name is? You won't find me in the known locations
I'd rather be alone in my beautiful basement, whoo

This on my list of shit to do, after I pick which whisper to listen to
And you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, ooh
Or we can fight about it after school
Whatever you have to do, I'm cool
You might also like
When I leave this Earth, feel the after tremors, might see my curse upon the back of the mirrors
Graffiti bridge is all tags and stickers, but we are the children of the action figures
And now we drop like matchsticks, figures
I got too many friends, and I can't keep up with the trends
And I know that I'm supposed to pretend
Like I'm afraid of the day that it's all gonna end
Where the hell have you been?
And how did time get spent, huh?
I gotta, gotta stop messin' about
Stick the neck out like you're stretching it out
The king wears a crown made of clouds
The whole crowd will get loud if you miss this foul
If you don't mind I'ma go mind my business now, whoo

This on my list of shit to do, after I pick which whisper to listen to
And you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, ooh
Or we can fight about it after school
But all ya'll are full of shit, and I'm coolEmbed
