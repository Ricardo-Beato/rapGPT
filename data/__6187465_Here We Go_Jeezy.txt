7 ContributorsHere We Go Lyrics
Damn, turn me up a little bit
God damn, Cannon
You ain't fuckin' around boy! Yeah

Here we go (Let's go)
Chopper, hold them fifties by the door (Door)
Bitch, I got blue hundreds on the floor (Woo)
Arm and hammer run, I'm at the store (Talk that shit, nigga)
Sick of nightmares of being poor (Yeah)
That's evil, I can smell it on your shirt (Ayy)
That's cut, 'cause I can smell it on the work (Woo)
My uncle used to tell me, "Know your worth" (Worth)
My grandma used to make me go to church (Let's go)

Times get hard, still believe in God (God)
Know some niggas down in Broward still believe in fraud (Woo)
Prеacher told me that I need to live my lifе with grace (Grace)
Lawyer wanted twenty 'fore he even touched the case (Damn)
Boy you be talkin' that shit 'cause I'm out the gutter (Gutter)
And I was talkin' that shit when I came out my mother (Woo)
Before he took his first breath, I lost my only brother (On God)
We motherfuck the world raw, I lost my only rubber (Let's go)
Now they gon' tell you that I really wasn’t 'bout that ('Bout that)
Like I ain't have a whole mill' before the contract
Like I ain't stand up in that kitchen catching contact (Woo)
Hey, I ain't like it so I had to make a comeback (Let's go)
You might also like
Here we go
Chopper, hold them fifties by the door (Door)
Bitch, I got blue hundreds on the floor (Floor)
Arm and hammer run, I'm at the store (Store)
Sick of nightmares of being poor (Yeah)
That's evil, I can smell it on your shirt (Ayy)
That's cut, 'cause I can smell it on the work (Woo)
My uncle used to tell me, "Know your worth" (Worth)
My grandma used to make me go to church (Let's go)

They tell you anything and y'all believe it too
I believe in me, nigga, do you believe in you? (You)
Million crabs in the barrel, boy, I never knew (Damn)
Let one leave up out the barrel, shit they'll never do (Nah)
Another man's opinion is never my reality
I never follow niggas, not my personality
The hustle dead and I call them niggas casualties (Killed)
I did it my way, that's probably why they mad at me
Now they gon' try to tell you I was never with that (With that)
Like I ain't hit the interstate and go and get that (Get that)
Like I ain't hit Chaquita house and go and split that
Like I ain't do this by myself and they resent that

Here we go (Let's go)
Chopper, hold them fifties by the door (Door)
Bitch, I got blue hundreds on the floor (Woo)
Arm and hammer run, I'm at the store (Talk that shit, nigga)
Sick of nightmares of being poor (Yeah)
That's evil, I can smell it on your shirt (Ayy)
That's cut, 'cause I can smell it on the work (Woo)
My uncle used to tell me, "Know your worth" (Worth)
My grandma used to make me go to churchEmbed
