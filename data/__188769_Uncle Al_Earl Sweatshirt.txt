90 ContributorsUncle Al Lyrics
Salmon skin Band-Aid help with recovery
Diction buttery, grass depending
Your nigga was switching passed depending on where the rudder swings
Snapping like the shutter speed, pucker up, kiss of death
Tell your men to hit the deck or hit the dirt
Killing who you send in first, verse wintergreen spit it, show 'em that I meant it
Ho, I'm rolling with my niggas, find a gold and call the chemist
Show up solo to the scrimmage, throw a brick and pour the Henny
Don't defend it, it's useless nigga
Up to my wrist in the cooler gripping the brew in this music shit
For Versace suicidal, I hit the Jake, threw the rifle
And tell her open that mouth for deposit, leave the bank broke
Sliding in, she smiling and fidgeting, pull my face close
Streaming down the street from what 'roma was stank though
Product of the villainy, product capable, plainclothes
Rhyme with no niggas who probably was gonna remain brokeYou might also like16Embed
