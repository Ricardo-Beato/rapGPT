26 ContributorsLook Up In Da Stars Lyrics
I've got so much to say
I know I've came so far
You understand my Swag
The you should look up in the stars
The stars, the stars, the stars

No big names. No big chains
Just Plain Pat visions with some sick aim
Cool Beans though, 10 Deep Jeans ho
Stampede fitted in the range with a knitted
No gimmick: Real time, Real heart
Real words...Elegant: A piece of art
No famous name vouch and I'm still the shit
Nigga first couple songs, no guest appearances
Now you sick, mayne. I ain't takin stabs
I'm just taking names, then I'm kickin' ass
I'll never be retro like a Cool Kid
With only two songs, look at what I did
Me and my nigga Wale let them suckas pass
Till we fed up and wet up Where niggas keep they swag
To the 'R'. Ruin niggas hopes of success
After LeBron, I'm what's next

Look up at da stars
Look up at da stars
Look up at da stars

Now I'm back on my grizzle, A plethora of strippers
I'm throwin around broads playing monkey in the middle
I'm curious Jorge, Fuck what dem whores say
Most of them is faker than the horse hair they forced in
I be in the club looking for a couple more of dem
Sorta like my first date. Fresher by the hullin'
I don't need your girl. Man I got a lot
They say he got a lot of whips, well I got A LOT
You can't unwind it. Rising and climbing
Ain't nobody brighter... I'm the man Winona Ryder
Lex Luger, narcissist, the mirrors get excited
The game is a store, Then miracle what I am
Maryland where I am, You niggas is behind us
There is not a list to find 'em
Anti-violent...Stylin, Lyrically inclined and
Who so ever hate, Mother shower him in violets

I've got so much to say
I know I've came so far
You understand my Swag
The you should look up in the stars
The stars, the stars, the starsEmbed
