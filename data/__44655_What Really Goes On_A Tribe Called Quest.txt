16 ContributorsWhat Really Goes On Lyrics
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump-da-bump-da-bump, bump-da-bump-da-bump

Yo, we preparin' ourselves for this ultimate war
But MCs is really lost and it's at a big cost
We be rhymin' at our show thinkin' we gettin' dough
Movin' through every town off the fumes of ****
And accolades from the crowd with our chests out proud
Yo, we 'bout to clap these joints so that these **** sound loud
Some kids be actin' stank like a baby pant
It's the rapper Abstract who make the joint get amped
Yo, move your body maker and use your minds to break true
Yo, we gotta do the do
Son, we livin' in a time where mad folks talk ****
Representin' they crews or they East-West cliques
Let me tell everybody from coast to coast
About the lands we boast, but we don't own jack
How the **** we movin' through makin' moves like that?
How the **** we movin' through makin' moves like that?
Can you explain that? I doubt that, very highly
We got jewels and Mo' and the life is type rowdy
Everybody lookin' **** like the tore down committee
Let's make this institution, buy this land for the smitties
I got girls with plenty tails, smarts and big ****
And they all stressin' me, yo, really?
What really goes on? (I-I-I-I-I don't know)

We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump, uh
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got that bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got that bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got that bump-da-bump-da-bump bump
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump. bump-da-bump-da-bump, bump-da-bump-da-bump bump

One is for the beat and the two is for the rhyme
Three is for the life, now we on this incline
Never catch this kid stickin' forks in swine
Never ran my gibs for nothin' less than a dime
A few of my brothers did a **** for a time
Strivin' to survive sometimes is known as crime
The three twenty-five got that Windex shine
And when I shot skellies, I had boxes in lines
All I wanna do is live life and be fair
I used to stress girls with long legs and long hair
Now I want a woman with a spiritual flair
God will never make it too hard for me to bare
I'm hungry like a derelict who stays in deludes
Some could count me out, but yo, I doubt that I'll lose
The Westernized world got our minds confused
You frontin' on me, akh, then your dome get bruised
The funny style cats, they be playin' games like Chucky
Government officials shoot their same old ****
They the devil agents AKA the devil flunky
Stiff-**** squares gettin' mad 'cause we funky
This the crack game, then we got the top cause
The positive jumps the negative like flaws
We deadin' evil vibes, yo, that **** is at the morgue
We celebrate laughin' down in at the smorgasbord
You still lookin' **** like the tore down committee
Let's make this institution, buy the lands for the smitties
I got girls with tails, plenty smarts and big ****
And they all stressin' me, really?
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump joint
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump joint (I don't know)
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump joint (I don't know)
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump joint
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump joint (I don't know)
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump joint (I don't know, I don't know)
We got the bump-da-bump-da-bump bump joint
We got the bump da-bump da-bump da-bump da-bump da-bump da-bump da-bump da-bump da-bump da-bump da-bump da-bump, bump, bump, joint1Embed
