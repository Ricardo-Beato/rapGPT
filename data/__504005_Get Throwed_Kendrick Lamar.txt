15 ContributorsGet Throwed Lyrics
You know I'm surgical with this bitch Jake
How you want it dawg?
Closed Casket?
Remember that fool in a wheelchair?
How you think he got there?

I got my air-conditioning on right now
Real cool about it
Oil talking please
Slick with it

Wanna know what death feel like
I suggest that you stay in the house at night
The scope that I got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right
Plus my connect got a pretty good price
I could take off your neck with just one slice of the blade
No, I'm not Wesley Snipes
One cut can have her screaming out first aid
Been this way ever since first grade
Forte demeanour was to get paid
Birthday solution was to shoot straight
Thirteen I was ready for gunplay
Stand on the block taking pay
I get four shots like a freak oh he know
Not to fuck with K-D-O-T
Oh, I forgot
Never come around here without a Glock
You want beef with your boy
Nigga I put heat on your boy
Leave him tied up on the back seat
With your boy duct taped won't let out noise
Oh yes we got them toys
Oh yes we got them choppas
LAPD they can't stop us
Rockets shoot down helicopters
In the kitchen (in the kitchen)
Betty Crocker (betty crocker)
Got kick (got kick)
You hate (you hate)
You wait (you wait)
One sec (one sec)
I'll be back we then gon' west
No vest, I'ma aim at your face
Unless you can stop them
I'm so throwed
Oh yes people there is a problem
I say
You might also like
(Know what I'm talking bout?
I can feel that lane
Sometimes I just lay back and let them look at me
I'm so  too
You see they be loving the oil talk
Its real slick for them
I keep the air conditioning on
Cool, cool, cool)

Pop shots yeah we kill niggas
On the real nigga
Run when I flex the steel
Coming with a  to grill niggas
Save on the ounce but don't know the price
But I know one time ain't bust late night
Trying to set me up so I gotta think twice
Ain't no fucking with it I'ma let em plague mic
I keep a nine for you dummies then I split your brain
I'm going to your safe, take your cash, cocaine
All your weed in your range cause you're going platinum chains
And when I leave I  your white carpet got a stain
Watch as my city get gritty
Fuck pity, we gon' do you niggas shitty
Domino effect when we spray them with the semi
Big k-holes in your dodge you can hear me
Front to back
Stack for stack
Nigga go clip for clip
Either gat for gat (braaap)
Wise niggas better check my stacks
We let the match ratatat
And all the heads we crack
Stacked, lots of cheese
Tryna cop the gs
 mac sale when we pop the fees
Cop the keys
To the boss got rocks to feed
Roster fees
Cause ain't nobody stopping me
I got a flow so cold
Style so bold
A nigga run up, I leave his face all swole
Hit him with the 8 better yet with the 4
And I don't feel bad he put himself in the hole
West coast in motion
