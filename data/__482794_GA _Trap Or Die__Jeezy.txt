3 ContributorsGA (Trap Or Die) LyricsI got a hundred pounds a hundred bricks
Nigga im from g a im from g a
I got a carbon fifteen with a infrared scope on my k on my k
I got a hundred pounds a hundred bricks
Nigga im from g a im from g a
And im the hottest nigga in the streets atleast thats what they say
And this is how i do
Walk straight up in the club chain down to my dick
Bitch
Sneak dissin nigga you ain't sayin shit
Drop seventy on my wrist to make it shine as white
And still won't give you lil niggas the time of day
Just bought a new Glock nothin better to do
Lil mofucker i got scales bigger than you
And this is real g shit you better stick to rhymin
We got guns big as that ragged ass car you drivin
And i bust a pussy ass nigga dead in his mouth
So i dont really understand what all the talkin about
And im a boss motherfucker it ain't no secret
And the k hold fifty it ain't no secret
Im puttin georgia on the map nigga you ain't doin shit
And lyrically i am mike vick
And broke niggas dont win but you already know
So next time you wanna play you better stack your doughYou might also likeEmbed
