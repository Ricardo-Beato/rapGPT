1 ContributorIf You Donâ€™t Know Lyrics
Happy new year, it's a new year
And I'mma tell you what I want you to do here
You gotta get up, you gotta get down
It's a jam and if you're square, you better get round
I got the Flavor, I got the Unit of 10 deadly MCs who fine tune it
Of the composer of this controversial literature
Stop! I think they call it hip-hop
The Q-to-the-U, the E, the E, the N
The L-A-T-I-F-A-H, I know it's hard to comprehend
But I'm identified as Latifah, you know?
The one that grabbed the mic and blew the speakers
So, so slide on the rhythm, 'cause it's slippery
Step on this here dance floor and see if you can get with me
I'mma rip stupidly for those who need to be reassured
As Nevelle gets funky on the keyboards

If you don't know where to find a party
You wanna learn how to shake that body
I got it here, this is your year
And you can do it, right here, right now

I'm Queen Latifah, and define (?) I'm anointing you
Blessing your mind with rhymes from an African point of view
Wanna see your neck turn in the direction I'm pointing to
All the way live, yes, that is the way that I come to you
When I start it off, I had to play the right tracks and
See the descrimination of the ones they call Black and
Indeed I was not the one to go for it
I put the pen to the pad and got a show for it
I got the Flavor Unit airing, always watching out
I do not cuss because my mommy said to watch my mouth
I keep you spinning, funking, jumping like a hula hoop
After we put the proper rhyme to a pumping loop
Now if you get down with the get down you'll be gettin' down
This is a hit and oh so hitting, and splitting sound
My lyrics added to some music make a perfect blend
But I think it's time I let the singing part come in
Come on!
You might also like
If you don't know where to find a party
You wanna learn how to shake that body
I got it here, this is your year
And you can do it, right here, right now

Well what do you know (What do you know?)
The record's almost done
I didn't know! (You didn't know?)
Well I was having too much fun
To the listeners, you know I thank you all
If you're like me, I know you had a ball
It brings me joy to see the party people working out
In case you didn't know, that's what this record's all about
So when you dance, remember to be positive
As we take it all the way to the bridge

Come on and dance
This is your chance, you might find romance
Be what you want to be
Baby, get crazy, come on get on the dance floor
For all you wanting more

If you don't know where to find a party
You wanna learn how to shake that body
I got it here, this is your year
And you can do it, right here, right now
If you don't know where to find a party
You wanna learn how to shake that body
I got it here, this is your year
And you can do it, right here, right nowEmbed
