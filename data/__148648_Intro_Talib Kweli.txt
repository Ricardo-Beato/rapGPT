6 ContributorsIntro Lyrics

Mic check (mic check!)
I'm at a loss for words (I'm at a loss for words)
But even me being at a loss for words (but even me being at a loss for words)
Is amplified (is amplified)
They wanna know what the end game is (they wanna know what the end game is)
This IS the end game (this IS the end game!)
Everybody here with a camera (everybody here with a camera)
Everybody here with a smartphone (everybody here with a smartphone)
Everyone here with a voice (everyone here with a voice)
Do your job (do your job!)
And spread the word (and spread the word!)
Make it grow (make it grow)
It's about growth now (it's about growth now)
We have to grow (we have to grow)
And that's the point (and that's the point)
I love y'all (I love y'all)
