22 ContributorsRest of My Life Lyrics
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my life
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
The rest of my

Life: dead presidents, devilish men
Overthrow king from they thrones 'cause of their negligence
Death, real shit'll start comin' to light
Niggas you ain't like dickin' your wife, what?
Kind of undermining, grimy, stiff corpse shapin'
Pork bacon, double-cross Satan
Heathens, non-god-fearing, lace thong wearing demons
But glory go to God, y'all beneath him
If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat
He'll show you streets where them big dealers drove at
Where low-key killers let the fo' clap
Blocka-blocka-blocka—oh
The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows
Everything a hood brother think he needs—yo
You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap
And I'ma use that for the—

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my life
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my
You might also like
Burnt-out, kicked to the curb
So I had to learn how to turn around a hundred thou' real fast
In '95 that was my last
I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the past
Rest in peace E Money Bags
No more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash
Lawyer want cash, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who got jel
They burnt a Range with a Molotov cocktail
My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover
Them cops swear, my little nigga told on me
I'm thinkin', "Hello, where's the L-O-V-E"
Pigs play games, my little man'll never say names
Word to his pops with elephant veins
They both locked-up still, word to Will
I'll make it and chill for the—

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my life
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my

My man gave his mommy coke
So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke
Damn, nigga, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms
So she don't have to bone for dimes?
Or give dome for nicks' in the roof of the projects
Where dogs shit and piss
Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed
Lexus coup-ed, baguettes from cubics
Might've been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six bars
To ten LPs
What can him tell me? Or them? Or y'all?
I'm Nas—on a track that's unorthodox
Like my life could've been offed by the cops
Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale
About the rest—
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my life
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The rest of my3Embed
