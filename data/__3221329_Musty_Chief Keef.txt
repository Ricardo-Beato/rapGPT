14 ContributorsMusty Lyrics
KidWonder, you made this beat? Dang!
(Let's get it)
A nigga bitch with me getting real touchy
Your bitch wanna get real touchy

A nigga bitch with me getting real touchy
That bitch wanna get lovey-dovey
They be like to do a lot of fussing
But that bitch don't do shit for me
She tryna make a nigga get lusty
She see a nigga smoking on musty
Me and gang nem pull them four's up
She see me at the corner with the doors up
(Let's get it)

Running up them bands, I get money
I'm my own boss, I'm tryna front me
Foreign in the back, foreign in the front of me
A couple bands ain't enough for my tummy
I'ma call the shooters, tell them round up
They ain't know a diamond til' they found us
In the strip club, tell 'em bring the ones out
Bet I had them bitches runninâ€™ with they buns out
Hella dirty fantas and sprites
You getting bread, let's get a slice
Drop a bitch off at Venice
Look, a gorilla in ice
Police got me on a heat sheet
I'm stepping on the bitches, they beneath me
I just pulled up on GLO GANG Street
I just bought a street sweeper, sweep sweep
You might also like
A nigga bitch with me getting real touchy
That bitch wanna get lovey-dovey
They be like to do a lot of fussing
But that bitch don't do shit for me
She tryna make a nigga get lusty
She see a nigga smoking on musty
Me and gang nem pull them four's up
She see me at the corner with the doors up
(Let's get it)

Said I walk up in the spot, but I'm smelling like a pound
Broski got the chop, play with me it's going down
We the hottest niggas round, we might show up to your town
On my neck, a hundred thou', touch, I put you in the ground
Tried to swim in water with the sharks, he gon' drown
White bitch sniffin' white, shit, I call her Bobby Brown
Tryna get my dick wet, you ain't fucking Dipset
I ain't had a hit yet, still got a big check

A nigga bitch with me getting real touchy
That bitch wanna get lovey-dovey
They be like to do a lot of fussing
But that bitch don't do shit for me
She tryna make a nigga get lusty
She see a nigga smoke on musty
Me and gang nem pull them four's up
She see me at the corner with the doors up
(Let's get it)1Embed
