Yeah
Yeah
Man

It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbin' a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinkin' of signin' me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should've known
'Cause you deserve it
You might also like
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've
It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin' going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
Now I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've
Hi Aubrey
I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place
All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feeling about that
So God bless you
And I hope I'll see you109Embed
