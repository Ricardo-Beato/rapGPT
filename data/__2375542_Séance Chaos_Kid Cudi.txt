20 ContributorsSéance Chaos Lyrics
Wondering if you could possibly help me
I'm looking for something, I need something to need a fix
I need something that will give me a little bit of a boost
Wondering if you could possibly help me, possibly help me
I'm looking for something, I need something to need a fix
I need something that will give me a little bit of a boost

Yeah, oh, oh
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Start the séance (Yeah)
Them weirding things are vicing
'Till I finally say alright
Never will I close my eyes
I like to see my speaker smile (Oh)
Hello birdie, what's the wording?
How do you do, how do you play?
Climb your mountain, think you're a fountain
Don't you get to ride my face
Play the teacher, I'll play the student
Play the asshole on stage
Play the clitoris code is morse
A thousand thank you's way too late (What's the case?)

Through the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life
Through the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life
Through the agony and strife, see my so called stinking life
Through the agony and strife, see my so called stinking life
So called stinking lifeYou might also like2Embed
