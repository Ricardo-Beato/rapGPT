1 ContributorGuess Who Lyrics
Yeah
Uh
Indeed
Okay

Guess who? Mr. Harlow (Yeah)
Got the ammunition and plenty of cargo (Pssh)
Star flow on the mic and they lovin' every track (Hoo)
Go the extra mile then I run a second lap (Heh, heh)
Yeah, and you know I get 'er done
Reppin' KY tryna have a little fun (Kentucky)
Competing with the sun 'cause the flow's so hot (Hoo)
Grind all day so I sure won't stop (Boom)
Boom! Yeah, guess who it be?
Spittin' so fluently on the track doin' me (That's me)
Who can be this dope? And I'm only thirteen (Thirteen)
Life is a movie and this is the first scene (First scene)
Yeah, and I stay so true
Just to make it to the top there's nothin' I won't do (No)
Writin' down lyrics ever since '02
I go hard in the paint see me doin' post moves

Yeah
J-A-C to the K
Uh
