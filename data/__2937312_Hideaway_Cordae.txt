13 ContributorsHideaway Lyrics
Hideaway, hideaway
Man, this shit - this shit is history, man

Yeah, I come from a different breed, got a different approach
'Cause what's life without grind and you living for hope
But man these kids be like nine and they hitting the dope
And so we fall into the plan, they consider us jokes
These all true facts but damn, you knew that
I mean I flew back to the city to drop a new track
I'm so anxious, but the listeners be so brainless
Keep your stupid ass opinion up your anus
You get the method, they catching bullets like interceptions
Rest in peace King Steelo, man, this shit a lesson
'Cause kids don't play tag, they got a Smith & Wesson
They quick to shoot your ass up if you disrespecting
And then crips, bloods, and pyru's pull up with 5 dudes
Come snatch your fly shoes, reminiscing high school
I've never been to one to hideaway confrontation
Especially from these bum rappers who not as patient
Amazing that they blow up, my time will come soon
We different like the ying-yang or the Sun moon
Braggin' 'bout your cheap chains, like you dumb coon
White folks mad see our posters on his son room
And we got 'em so scared we compelling the youth
They attracted to my music, I'm telling the truth
Roomate saying "Nigga, nobody better than you"
I swear he'd never lie 'cause we move like a veteran movin'
You might also like
I'll put you on with all my rap niggas, bruh
Like this shit 'bout to be sweet

I never hide away from pressure, I'm never afraid
I can't wait for the years where I'm better than Jay
And I'm talking 'bout accounts, I'll have cheddar for days
Flippin' stocks, show these niggas I'm clever with ways
Will flip a beat till misery, this shit is history
That's word to legend Tye Tribbett, I got the victory
Your shit is weak, that's a known fact, no mystery
I blow up and 'sho 'nuff it's meant to be
Visions of future, I'm timid with Luther
Nailing notes to my wall, fuck we posing and ball
All this explosion I caused how cause the emotion raw
Feds is imposing the law, killing us choking us all
Now they unloading the dogs, tempers is rising
Oh, you done started something, you know niggas be violent
You done gave us reason, now we major, we bleeding
On the crip of the evening, come equipped with a deacon
Because prayer is needed, they got a layer defeated
But we just busting through, nigga, that's up to you
I learned knowledge through experience, we say "Fuck the schools"
I pop a pill like I'm Bill but I'm no Huxtable
And I'll never run away, nigga1Embed
