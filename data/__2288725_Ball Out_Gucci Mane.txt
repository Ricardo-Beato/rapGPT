If we gon ball out on me ball you already know what it is
Y'all understand 1017 American dream y'all know what it is
Turn up 

You know I had to ball out and buy the mall out 
You know I had to ball out, ball out 
You know I had to ball out and buy the mall out 

Maybach with the curtains up Mclaren with the doors up
I pull up they froze up these haters got their nose up
Double got his change up double rich left the hood and guaranteed
No more doing stupid shit, them club owners notice me I pulled up in VIP
Hopped out looking fabuly you can't help but notice me
It's 1017 exclusively everything we do is above a thousand
300 Jeans Louis shoes purple in the cup
Higher that the stars is, probly where the Mars is
Shawty say she want that money just to see how stars feel
Yea I got that girl in hell yeah i'm going in
Hustling like a mother fucker every time the drugs in
Fruity color diamonds all ma colors wanna do
Wild D I got you I'm just doing this shit for you
Everyday I'm in the streets like the industry
You might also like
You know I had to ball out and buy the mall out 
You know I had to ball out, ball out 
You know I had to ball out and buy the mall out 

I'm in the industry and I ain't giving up until a mother fucker finish me
Double making moves Double breaking rules all about the money nigga look at ma shoes
Take a look in ma car, take a look at ma jewels
I'm shining hard I got yo wife in blurry
Thousand dollar shades i'm hanging with the bosses
Play me at a park and yo family go take some losses
Fuck playing games nigga i'm sending you into a coffin
Money by the pound  fuck around off you
Gucci I done bought enough a that to start a stove
And ma closet full a Louis V like a store

You know I had to ball out and buy the mall out 
You know I had to ball out, ball out 
You know I had to ball out and buy the mall out Embed
