Young Money, Gudda Gudda
Let's get it!

You know that yopper yop, it really yop
And when your body drop, I skip and hop (Hop)
Red laser beam (Yeah), put your face on beam (Yeah)
All this syrup, all these trees, call me maple leaf
Hollygrove, nigga, solid gold, nigga
Ice, ice, baby chilling, hockey froze, nigga
Play your role, nigga, play your role, bitches
I'm in the ceiling looking like a pot of gold, bitches
You know that yopper yop (Yeah), it really yop (Yeah)
I got he street sweeper (Yeah), and need a mop (Need a mug)
I'm not a peacekeeper (No), I'm really not (Yeah, yеah)
I told a heat seeker, it's getting hot (Yеah)

New baguettes is on my neck, it's from the goat what you expect, woah
I ain't fly cripping but I'm fly, diamonds jet blue
Look at how we crept through, dollars like Creflo
I can let the TEC go, turn him to a vegetable
Mula game, next to blow up, here to ball, we said before
We about to set it, I install the blaze and set the fire
Pressure, that's what we applying
Add some more, make some diamonds
There's a time for everything and you can't time perfect timing
Coke from Medellin, you won’t find nothing purer
Now just steps on the brick, all white like the Fuhrer
Middle fingers up to the judge and the jury
If I ever gotta face 'em, do my time, don't make a statement
It's omerta up to the grave
My bro make sure all my kids gravy (That's right)
Young Money the army, better yet the navy
We gon' drag him from the river, dump his body in junkyards
With the note around his neck reading "Bitch, you should've paid me"
You might also like
Drag him from the river, dump his body in junkyard
Leave a note around his neck that say "I told you not to flex", ooh
Emerald baguettes, they just explode on my Pateks, ooh
Stripper made a mess, I just exploded on her chest, ooh
Drag him from the river, dump his body in junkyard
Leave a note around his neck, I take his throat up out his neck, ooh
Get it off your chest, ooh, I will never front, no
Chilling on a jet, ooh, I never connect, no
Drag him from the river, dump his body in junkyard
Leave a note around his neck that say his ho and mama next
Leave a note around his neck that say "I told you not to flex"
Leave a note around his neck then take that gold from 'round his neck

I drag him from the river, dump his body in junkyard
Leave a note around his neck, say the goat around this bitch
Leave a note around his neck, I take his throat up out his neck, ooh
You be talking out your neck, then bitch we going at your neck, yeah

One time for all the fans out there, for all the fans worldwide!
You know the love is felt!
Lil Wayne, No Ceilings 3, Young Money!2Embed
