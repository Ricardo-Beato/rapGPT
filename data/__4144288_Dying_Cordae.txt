7 ContributorsDying Lyrics
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I've seen it all, from drug trades to gang bangin'
'Till lungs' being exhausted, we speak the same language
Broken homes, picture frames hangin'
And jewelry always being snatched, ain't no chains swingin'
I witnessed a wicked decision and did plenty of living
Picture a nigga whose vision is just no longer vivid
Pour out the liquor on scripture so they say it was written
But the message of the story is just your position, I mean
You ever see dreams crumbling in your eyes
The thundering in the skies have you wondering if it's God
But I'm one of them, I survived by 
We stay true for generations, that's designer jeans
And your whole life you just desire for the finer things
Like that imaginary husband with the diamond ring
But ain't no other way to get it so we try to scheme
But never sleep 'cause I hear tears from your dying dreams

All the hurt got me laughing at pain
'Cause the sun comes after the rain
Oh, but life ain't fair
Hurricanes got me passing with rage
Forget the message that the pastor had gave

Full of sadness at the parties, you can't dance to the rhythm
Spend your whole life regretting that outlandish decision
And you find yourself with nothing once the damage is finished
Now I be the one to say that ain't the way to go
'Cause when your heart filled with hate, I know it taint your soul
And dare I say to prosper, dog, you gotta play your roll
With music I'm a young Picasso and I paint in gold
I know the feel to have your checks always jump and they bounce
Acquire about accounts, you know what's the amount
And you wanna cop that bike for your daughter to ride
But you go up front to pay and your card'll decline
And this just another day, yeah your life full of struggle
But it won't last long,  on the double because...

All the hurt got me laughing at pain
'Cause the sun comes after the rain
Oh, but life ain't fair
Hurricanes got me passing with rage
Forget the message that the pastor had gave
And I know, I know
Life is throwing everything at me
I take it all, try to stay happy
I can't ignore it, it hurts so badly
But I
