17 ContributorsThe Phuncky Feel One Lyrics
Are you ready? Ladies and gentlemen, all ready to get down?
Are you ready? Ladies and gentlemen, y'all ready to get down?
Ladies and gentlemen

Well I'm the Real one, yes the phuncky feel one
Cypress Hill has come, any questions ask them
'Cause we are answerin', any brothers that've been
On the dick swingin', and straight gatherin'
Enter all the info, cause yo what you're in fo'
Is a crazy day, strapped in a pimp mode
Trapped like a prophet, but I still profit
Even when you're off it, bank's in my pocket
'Cause of my music, what you call me chumpy?
In my trade, the Tribe is known to get funky
Hif is here to hack you down, Son is here to buck you down
Joke's on you, cause you're the biggest duck in town
You've got to relax, we got to kick back
Brothers just sit back, enjoy me like a six pack
As I let the rhyme flow into the hook, yo
Where you gettin' took, but that's another story black

Cause I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one
I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one
I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one
You know I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one
Phuncky, phuncky, phuncky, phuncky

Night in a stiff lock, hangin' up the pimp's jock
Used to call me Pimp Poppa, specialize in hip-hop
'Cause I'm down with Cypress, illin well I might
Begin to take your girl, your girl she's the flyest
Flyer than the other broad, hookin' on the fish rod
Isn't that odd, instead of sayin' my dick's hard
It's not about knockin' you, do you feel like clockin' loot?
Forget it, act stupid little sucker I'll be clockin' you
With the right or left hand, duck they was still stand
Troopers on the side step, bucks him down to death man
With the greater lyric, if you can spare it
Just an ass kickin', is what you inherit
So don't try to snake off, you know I can't be shook off
Why the suckers took off? Well that's another story black

Cause I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one
I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one
I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one
You know I'm the real one, yes the phuncky feel one
Phuncky, phuncky, phuncky, phuncky
Phuncky, phuncky, phuncky

Standin' on the corner, close to the real estate
Homes I really feels it get when brothers try to imitate
Meanin' when they simulate, but they can't stimulate
Like a fatty joint, straight from the breath I take
Make me act loco, then switchin' up my vocal
Out to catch you so-called MC's with a roll call
Then you gotta close your eyes, you can't stand the sunlight
There is just one light, the Tribe's buckin' heads tonight!
Buck buck buck ya head! Sorry that Fred is dead
Deader than a doornail, someone cold made his bed
Didn't just break out, the sucker got cracked out
Hit the pipe and blacked out, with the shit from back down
So much more integrity, greatest deal I hook up
Was a funky looker
But that's another story black
Cause we're the real ones, yes, the phuncky feel ones
We're the real ones, yes, the phuncky feel ones
We're the real ones, yes, the phuncky feel ones
You know we're the real ones, yes, the phuncky feel ones
Phuncky, phuncky, phuncky, phuncky
Phuncky, phuncky, phuncky, phunckyEmbed
