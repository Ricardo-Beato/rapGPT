Rap (verse 1)
Court is in session i'm the judge jury and the prosecution, my word cos mine conjugus
Ain't no need for confusion i'm here to stay me in the rap game party together like fusion
I wanna talk to Illuminati wanna let you ladies whose first hits screen gets me bar
I was dedicated to the party touring oversea spreading our culture to different nationality
From MC like calories what ya need to do is pay homage and make some sister challenge me
Like i said just me on wax i'll be of value and it'll happen when you least expected exactly
If it ain't rough, I can do without it and some of you all MCs in hiphop just making the game crowded
Let's play a little game of elimination or detonation, separate the rack like segregation

Rap (verse 2)
You know whats up choice stay on my piece you ain't no rapper you just play one on TV or radio and CD
Acting like you wanna see me but really cheeky geek i ain't see me
Check out my whole unit row this new kid study my scripts like the dead sea scroll
My M.O i'm in the back of a stretch land-cruise limo paying customer shot dollar dicussing
You see i am trying to hear nothing so i'm back to recap like Elmino, winds blow, clouds thunder spins the earth off its axis
Me slash rapper, slash actress, slash if you trying to front we get your ass kicked, we used P.O.W torture tactics
Who trying to get at us, cos my friends i feel pleasure in your pain like i should never
I should bronx my pimp we should be hanging platinum, pix i'm stackin' em
Classics from me is automatic, i keep' em hitting in the attic
Ladies rock to this, fellas on the floor grab your crotch to this, watch my progression court is in session

Make you jump outta your gatters and boots, sweats and limo suits, we winning my records on the table spinning

Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl
Standin' 'round waitin' for my queendom to fall
Well I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got
I'm tellin' you straight up, all sleepin' beauties better wake up
I'll tear your state up, so set the date up
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it
Who did it, who does it
From private to public
Anywhere I'm in there and been there
So recognize this, who the nicest
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes
Whatever you want I got
Whether you ready or not
It's about to get hot when I drop
So notes, pause another spot
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you
Don't try to be me, do you
Be coo' to you and do you
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane
I am the Queen, that's my name, time to explain
That I spit game with dames
Leave 'em all with shit stains
Split frames, hopin' you hopin' that I'm jokin'
Don't know but still blink off like fo'-fo's
But so-so, slow mo's comin' in like the po-po's
Don't want rocks comin' at me the wrong way
Packin' much rocks, it's gonna be a long day
And for real, spittin' on imbessiles and spinnin' wheels
On my 600 you want it, you must be blunted
I'll take it to your stomach, run it, give me all

Well, it's almost nightfall
And there's no forecast of rainfall
And I'm in the mood for a party
So I'm gonna go out to a club
And give the dancefloor body
So I jump in the car and go to the venue
Walk in the door and now I'm on the menu
Guys in the house, they're watching me
They're clocking me, there's no stopping me

(Desire) I know you want me
(You're fine) Thank you
But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am
I don't jump into the arms of every man
(But I'm paid) I don't need your money
(I love you) You must be mad
Easy lover is something that I ain't
Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint

Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys
I always hear, "yo, baby"?
I mean like what's the big idea?
I'm a queen, nuff' respect
Treat me like a lady
And, no, my name ain't yo and I ain't got your baby
I'm looking for a guy who's sincere
One with class and savoir-faire
I'm looking for someone who has to be
Perfect for the Queen Latifah, me

All my friends are in relationships
Some of them good ones and some of them bad ones
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get
I want a friend, not just a lover
Someone who is dedicated only to me
Not to me and two or three others
One who will not lie to me or think
He can get my love by buying me
I know I'll find him someday
And when I find him
He sure won't say


Lounging, sitting in the house
And I'm cooling, first day of the week
So there's nothing to do
And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss
Momma never said there'll be days like this
So I called her and we talked for a while
Hang up the phone feeling better
With a smile
It's cool, cuz '91 is my year
And this time I know I'm gonna hear

Black on black love
That's what I'm thinking of
That's what I want from you
To thine own self be true
Black on black love
That's what I'm thinking of
C'mon, 'cause we're in this together, y'all
Let's try to make our hoods a little better, y'all

Last night after I prayed, I layed my head down
Tired after a hard day
I blocked out the siren sound
As I fell into a deep sleep
I don't have dreams of cream
My dreams are vivid and seldom seen
And much to my delight
I saw my peoples in a different light
Tension was gone
We stood Black and strong
Instead of a day
We had a lifetime of atonement
I felt loved
I didn't have to treasure the moment
Instead of drugs, we gave out hugs
And you payed with pain
No more thugs and
Everybody knew everybody's name
No tricks, no cheaters, women beaters, pimps or whores
Less stress, and a whole lot less liquor stores
Children played without worries of strays
Longer days with shorter nights
No need to fight
We all stuck tight
We stayed away from the traps
As a people, we lived right and exact
And showed a whole lot more of that
You might also like

In my dream, we all loved our neighbors
Did each other favors
And used the good sense God gave us
Watched each others' backs
And lifted while we climb
There was no crime
None of my brothers was doin' time
And they treated all their sisters like ladies
Women didn't worry because their men didn't act shady
Mothers were proud of their seeds
And kept a big smile
'Cause the whole village chipped in
And raise that one child
We supported our local Black-owned stores
We were down for the cause
The next man make sure you had yours
There were no robberies, murders, or rapes
No child molesters
We took control of our own fate
The life span of the Black man increased
Times were less stressed
We did our best to live in peace
We showed love for rap
Kept in contact
We stayed away from the traps
And showed a whole lot more of that

Now as I wake up to face this harsh mentality
It's just a dream or prayer, far from reality
As I wait, the siren sounds begin again
I get up, walk to my window
Wondering if it will ever end
When I look out, nothing's changed
Hustlers are still there
Lady on the phone yelling how her baby father doesn't care
Conflicts with derelicts over squeegies
Homeless will work for food
"Would you please feed me?"
It's our duty to try and help remove some of the stress
Every 20 minutes a child dies a violent death
Parents are frustrated
Wondering where they went wrong
Knowing that that fast money, it won't last long
We got some that fight for rights to be equal
Some struggle, and still we commit crimes against our own people

Love, love, love
Bump, bee-ahh-dump bah-dump-bah
Black on Black love
Don't let it chain react
Or fall into the traps
It's time to recognize
And start spreading some of that
Love, love, love
Bump, bee-ahh-dump bah-dump-bah
Black on Black love
Love, love, love
Bump, bee-ahh-dump bah-dump-bah
Black on Black love
Don't let it chain react
Or fall into the traps
It's time to recognize
And start spreading some of that

You not ready to test the La
Faking the funk
Confess or die
Not physically, but lyrically
Come on, give it your best try
The flow's coming
Don't get caught up in it
Talking about straps and gats
When the only tools you had had water in it
Wait a minute, I'm about to spark shit
If you smoking 20 blunts a day
Chances are you smoking garbage
A whore bitch? No me, no never
Too clever, too feminine
I'm on the winnin-in
Selector rewind and come again
Then let it drop again, don't stop again
Rappers is petty
Latifah coming for her props again
No matter where in the US you reside

And been respected since I start to speak mine

No dirt where you be at
Think before you react

Givin' you what you need

Ride the whip to Merrill Lynch
While others ride the bench
We come through in the clench
You never see us flinch
Your cheese come in increments
Mine come 'til I'm drenched
Slim bars from the femme squad
Chick meaner than M-Ra
Wanna spar? We can go par
5'2", leave your chin scarred
No complication
Mine and conquer nations
Deep concentration
Realize the comp you're facing
Ay yo, hand over this
Gettin' money hand over fist
No time to parlay
Hunting them hundreds that's crisp
Producers that's A-list
Lyrics that lace this to
Make sure these hits never miss

A track done by each for thoughts to reach ya
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day

I wanna rock off the dome
Rock written poem
Rock in cars, clubs, and homes
‘Til everything I’m spitting is known
‘Til I’m written in stone
Got rhymes running through my head
While I’m sitting alone
The Queen with glimpses of thrones
My imagination takes me to other places
In God’s creation
Sometimes I switch to jazz stations
To try to help my patience
Tested with stress from this crazy life I live
Nevertheless, keep my attitude positive
My prerogative is always to have a pot to piss in
If I get shitted on by the biz
Watching this statuesque check holder
Drop to this as you rest in your Rover
The Remy and Amaretto
Got me high like falsetto
Sexy in stilettos
Trooping through the ghetto
Let me head go with my feet
Can’t peddle ‘til my bread grow
Too much in me to ever settle

Lived to talk about it

Doctors couldn’t save him
And to my other brother
Murder was the case that they gave him
I know innocent was your plea
And since you got it
Give God the credit
Stay strong and don’t let it
Get you down

Or whether you topping bills
Or making mills
Pac was enough
But they had to take yours
You gone
The shit hurt
Ain’t no reason to fake for
Your wife shedding tears
And your crew
They ache for you
But you got seeds
And we got to make sure

There's a cry asking why, I pray the answer's up ahead
'Cause I know where I've been

There's a road we've been travelin'
Lost so many on the way
But the riches will be plenty
Worth the price, the price we had to pay

There's a dream in the future
There's a struggle that we have yet to win
And there's pride in my heart 'cause I know where I'm going
Yes I do!
And I know where I've been, yeah

There's a road
We must trave
There's a promise
We must make
But the riches
Will be plenty

Welcome into my Queendom (My Queendom)
Come one come all
When it comes to lyrics, I bring them (I bring them)
In spring I sing, in fall I call out to
All the ones who had a hard day
I prepared a place on my dance floor
The time is now for you to par-tay
I thought it would be a good chance for you to move
(One nation under a groove)
House music always soothes
So get with the flow, let's go, yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo?
If so, then shall we let the games begin?
What better off position can you be in?
I'm on fire, the flame's too hot to douse
The pool is over, come into my house

Don't make me wait
Come into my house (Give me body)
Don't make me wait
Come into my house (Give me body)

Here's a dance step from Al and Kika
Bass and treble flow through the speakers
Ride the rhythm, I know it's gonna reach ya
I'm the queen, Latifah
Now it's time to run through it
45 King? (Yeah, baby?) Cue it
Yeah, there you go, I told you you could do it
Now did you enjoy it? (That was cool)
I knew it
Dance to the beat of the drum
Give me some
With the Flavor Unit I've come
To say "ride the groove line"
Don't swing the pipe bomb
Listen to the smooth line
Throw away the white line
It's a house party I'm hosting (What?)
Come and rock with the one that's chosen
It can't turn me inside out (Uh uh)

Hip-hop house, hip-hop jazz, with a little pizzazz
From the queen, the Queen of Royal Badness
Remember me from "Wrath of My Madness?"
It's my rap that rocks this party
I'm a hijack and jack your body
This is not an erotic interlude
Keep in mind I move multitudes
The Asiatic Black woman, hardcore beat drumming
It's hard to keep a good woman down, so I keep coming
Blow for blow, I take and I get some
Still I rise in a civilized wisdom
I hope the lyrical display has you around
It's an open invitation
Come into my house

I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)
This MC stands for "Microphone Commando"
When I command that you take a hand
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)
A battle, put me in it, I win it
The mission is music and rhythm
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in
Heart into the music, music I take part in
One try, one God, and one destiny
Just dance for me
"Dance to the music"  (Repeat 2x)
Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to
My brother Lance said "Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet"
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat
Ample samples, this for example
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel
Your plans of moving to the front lines
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine
I hop, dip, and spend with the children
So get down with the sound and you will lend
To let me sing while I bring
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it
So if you want to know what the plan is to be
I order you to dance for me

My voice is your choice at a stage show
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say "ho"
With powerful lyrics I'm armed
To let a sucker step up and get bombed
By a beat created by my producer
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to
This here is a moment of truth
So take the record to the DJ booth
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some
People dancing, I can spot 'em
When I take control, you know I got 'em
Stop the music?  That's not a question
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be
I order you to dance for me
"Dance to the music"  (Repeat 6x)Embed
Let's start the show off, sisters'll go look alive
The Queen Latifah, the King of 45
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor
I make beats, she rock rhymes, so I
Gave her
A sample sound, the she added a compound
Word, this is for those who haven't heard
A King and Queen combine minds and trample
Those who oppose us, here's an example;

It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set
The competition is petty and ready to step
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken
Queen Latifah's outspoken
Use your imagination, picture this
Any male or female rapper trying to diss
Here for excitement and enticement
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment
Teach the youth, feed the needy
Confident decendent of Queen Nefertiti
The mother of civilization will rise
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation
Secondary but necessary to reproduce
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation

Technician, musical musician
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most
Creativity, you get a double dose
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet)
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em
I rock, never hyperventilate
Others get tired, could use a commercial break
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias
It takes a ton of MC's to prevail against me
Just listen, I'm unstoppable
You want a mission?  This one's impossible
Beats rock all night with no curfew
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it
If the style fits, I wear it
Many attempts were made, none was recognized
45 King said, sound personified
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet
Studio mixer, I got the formula
And said the man from self, I'm warning you
It's my domain, just ask my chauffer
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa
On top, it's a usual act
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of SwingEmbed
The ladies will kick it, the rhyme that is wicked
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted
A woman can bear you, break you, take you
Now it's time to rhyme, can you relate to
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream

Ayo, let me take it from here, Queen...
Excuse me but I think I'm about do
To get into precisely what I am about to do
I'm conversating to the folks who have no whatsoever clue
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes)
(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)

Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see
I know that all the fellas out there will agree with me
Not for being one but for being with one
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting
We are the ones that give birth
To the new generation of prophets cause it's Ladies First

I break into a lyrical freestyle
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
(With what?) With a little touch of "Ladies First"
Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
A female rapper with the message to send the
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen

My sister, can I get some?

Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb

Yo, praise me not for being simply what I am
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American
You dig exactly where I'm coming from
You want righteous rhyming, I'mma give you some
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay
Pay me every bit of your attention
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm
Of which is now systematically given
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another
Plus one more; all four
Have a job to do, we doing it
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder
Cooling on the scene with my European partner
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax
When I get there, that's when I tax
The next man, or the next woman
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming
And I'll recite the chapter in verse
The title of this recital is "Ladies First"
Step out into the night
Queens of civilization are on the mic
The scene is right, the crowd is hype
I expel the wack and those who bite
Why, cause I'm that type
Swaying with beats 45 King style
He wants me to sing but I swing, so meanwhile
A footnote for the opposite sex
Monie ripped the mic, I rocked it next
Plex, you never catch me at my worst
You get the drift? It's Ladies First5Embed
Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of
Being forced to put suckers in their place
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face
But I'm not buying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two
I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me
Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me
So don't smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two
I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?
Queen Latifah's here to lay the law down
So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown
The 45 King is arising, suprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par
So I hope you've prepared yourself for what you're in for
This is Latifah's Law
BMW's and gold rope chains don't impress me
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me
Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life
Fire and desire make you go a little higher
When I grab the wire of the mic
And get hype, I'm sorry your sound died
Cause I roll like the homicide squad
You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and
Left you in the litter to consider coping with
Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen
You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again
Get a grip on the African way
Cause there's a sucker born every day
Crime's the way for you to see what the Queen saw
And this is Latifah's law

And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to
The Flavor Unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band
And slides keep the hardcore fall, cause I'm heavy-handed
Whip out a .45 caliber pen and begin
A funky message from beginning to end
Peace be to Africa, can't forget my other land
Won't fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland
You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense
In case you forgot, just check your conscience
At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine
Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine
Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew
Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do
Number three: check your heart, every man has a call
It's time for me to go, but I'll be back, y'allEmbed
Uh huh, well the name is Latifah, you hear me coming through
The speaker. Hit it Mark, 45 King

I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when
It's time to ill I get ill and time to chill
I chill, my homeboy said this was the D.A.I.S.Y. age
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it
You think I'm sleeping on you? Please, don't even try it
The name is Latifah, the scene, it is mine
The 45 King keeps the beat and the time while I
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out
So don't try to turn me inside out

Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn

It's so so simply done
When I find that I have to run
Lyrics to music by the King of Swing, The 45 King
The words we bring I write, and sing
Cause I am Latifah, the Queen of course
Don't try to get yours off, because the cause is lost
Mark conducts the beat, I watch it hit them
Won't you chill? I don't need another victim
To add to the list of aggravation
Subtracting suckers like a math computation
We are not teaching pupils and subjects with no scruples
This is a King and Queen creation
So hello hello hello and how ya doing?
Forget the small talk now, it's time for me to ruin
Those who don't believe in what I'm saying
When I put up the wall of words ain't no way into my Queendom
Controlled by me, the heir to the throne is the Ruler Lord Ramsey
The Ruler Lord, to him there is no equal
He grabs it and starts bombing people
Don't listen to me to figure me out
Because you can't turn my mind inside out

Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn
Rhyming's not a question of one superiority
But rather how you delegate the use of your authority
I know who you are, and I know who you are to me
But I came here just to party
If it's a show you want, the show it live
And if it's trouble you seek, I have arrived
When Mark requests my approval, I nod
And after each and every single rhyme I thank God
Altough a taste of my body would soothe you
I give you just my voice and watch the rhythm move you
The method of my lyrics makes the funky people feel it
And Lord have mercy on those that try to steal it
Latifah is a name meaning "delicate and sensitive"
But I have no problem formulating sentences
To break you down to the ground
I won't use violence, the color of this is brown
And I am down, but never ever down and out
So don't try to turn me inside out

Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn
Jah know? Cause ah...
Music, 45 King, music Latifah the Queen
Music, domination to bring the world
Irie, say in the fire you will burn (Repeats to fade)Embed
You asked, I came, so behold the Queen
Let's add a little sense to the scene
I'm living positive, not out here knocked up
But the lines are so dangerous, I ought to be locked up
This rhyme doesn't require prime time
I'm just sharing thoughts of mine
Back again cause I knew you wanted it
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it
Dropping bombs, you're up in arms, you're puzzled
The lines will flow like fluid while you're guzzling
The sip I drop you on a BDP-produced track
From KRS, to be exact
It's a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking
Cause it's knowledge I'm seeking
Enough about myself, I think it's time that I tell you
About the evil that men do


Situations, reality—what a concept!
Nothing ever seems to stay in step
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers
Here are some things I want to cover
A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares?
Because she's living on welfare
I government can't come up with a decent housing plan
So she's in no man's land
It's a sucker who tells you you're equal
You don't need him—Johannesburg's crying for freedom!
We the people hold these truths to be self-evident
But there's no response from the president
Someone's living the good life, tax-free
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free
And that's just part of the message
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do
You might also like

Tell me, don't you think it's a shame?
When someone can put a quarter in a video game
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street
You can't treat him the same
It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds
You to a doom, a fate worse than death
But there's still time left
Stop putting your conscience on cease
And bring about some type of peace
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind
It will benefit all mankind
Then there will be one thing that will never stop
And it's the evil that men do

Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me
Forgive the crowds, O Lord
They know not why they sweat me
Biting's against the law in the place that I live
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib

The call me the high priestess of disaster
Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta
There's never been a word I can't master
I've always been, a piddly pastor

I reign, the lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side
And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light

The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
She rhyme American, she rock Jamaican
Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world

You try to dissect my rhymes to see if there's a pattern
I bounced it all around you like the rings around Saturn
Let me know now if you would like to protest this proceeding
A greeting, or would you rather progress
Onto a higher plateau, truly I'm taking it slow
Enough for you to seek the knowledge and to know
I'm the Q-U-E-E-N, L-A-T-I-F-A-H
Queen of the R.E. Posse, the GLA which is Get Live Alright
You standing there chewing on your fingernails nervous

It's a concoction, for my ability
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility
Cause they don't know I'm the one to front on, or two
I'm snatching hearts cause I'm Latifah and I want to
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip
I'm kicking gold, so grab a hold and get a good grip
Stop the lying, the trying
The time buying, you've been denying
'Cause you're dependent on me, the princess of the posse
I got the cards, so I'm dealing a death blow
You're taking no crowns, put that on cease
My DJ's name is Mark the 45 King
To the posse, peace
Got to let you know where I come from

I'm back, a black queen upon the scene
With a knack for funky tracks, know what I mean?
Prince Paul produces this and it's a fly one
It had to be that way, he's one of my sons
It's a family affair and then we're out of here
There's no doubt here, 'cause this is our year
So flex to a Queen Latifah/De La Soul sound

It was inevitable that this joint venture would be incredible
We never put ourselves on any pedestal
But the rhyme is so good it's practically edible (Say what?)

I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn
The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in
A female walked up to me and said "Latifah bust a line
I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time"
I said "If you really want to do this, we can do this, fine
Take six paces and begin to rhyme"
As soon as she attempted to make a sound
I ate her up with the verb, broke her down with the noun
Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me
I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow
I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings

Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing
Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them
Rhyme fiends, biters, and bums
Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight
I kinda got uptight (You didn't do what I think you did?) Yeah, right!
Bash! went the first, Smash! went the next one
He started, he started to run
But to his surprise, his feet must have slipped
Cause I snapped that neck before the second step
You see you may speculate, but everybody knows
Not one amateur can deal with the pros
These are the pros, coming now from Queen Latifah and Daddy-O
And if you want to hear some more then just follow
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say "Bo bo bo!"

There was a time that a man could go
Anyplace, anywhere without a Rambo
But now me have to keep me pistol loaded with rhyme
Have to deal with bad breath biters that step out of line
So when they make a move them surely get a taste of it
I'm Daddy-O and I don't quit
So feel the flow, y'all, because you're under attack
From my rhymes, cause I'm writing swift rhymes in stacks
And four words to the wack, just "Stay the hell back"
Cause it's a fact if you're wack you ain't saying jack
So we can go rhyme for rhyme if you wish
But eating you suckers is my favorite dish
And I warned you suckers if you messed with me
You'll be the next ingredient in my recipe
Start and don't finish, I'll hunt you down
And you can't run forever, so you'll be found
And with nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide
How you wanna be eaten, boy, baked or fried?
These are the pros, coming now from Queen Latifah and Daddy-O
And if you want to hear some more then just follow
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say "Bo bo bo!" (Repeat 2x)

It's Latifah the Queen, pioneer of the mainstream
I flow just like a pro cause it's the same thing
Suckers have to realize how foolish they sound
So button your lips and stop trying to be down
I caught you out there (How many times?) A lot of times
Cause when it comes to mine, you know I gotta rhyme
Stepping to the right, to the left
To the best place, well I have to face
A sucker like a pooh-butt, weak and soft
Riding my brastrap trying to get off
Understand and know, if you want to go
You'd better be ready to flow cause I'm a pro
These are the pros, coming now from Queen Latifah and Daddy-O
And if you want to hear more then just follow
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say "Bo bo bo!" (Repeat 2x)

We wax floors with bums, make mocks out of some
Sting 'em hard, and watch them complain how it stung
Kidnap the babysitter, lock 'em inside a box
Daddy-O and the true blue Queen of Rock
These are the pros, coming now from Queen Latifah and Daddy-O
And if you want to hear more then just follow
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say "Bo bo bo!" (Repeat 4x)Embed

Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay

Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, TECs, jimmy hats, in case I need protection
So I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wanna be’s
A kid in a M3's getting jacked right in front of me
So I play the TEC close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they steps 'cause mine's is slightly bigger
But better yet I'm a threat, so you better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, 'cause I don't wanna talk
I stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too
I got the fever for the flavor of a Woo Woo
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay

Time to chill, hit the hill uptown, let's peep the sights
Shoot some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight
I'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a DT
But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?
Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie
I'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay

You know I gotta give props, I can't stop, without y'all, I'll be nothin
No wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'
No stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real life perspective and rule
'Cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day, around the way, around the muthafuckin' way

Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood

My mellow, Latee, was kicking flavor
The R.E. posse said "Yo Latifah we can do this"
So I paused and took a thought
Then my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to flex
Cause I'm in full effect
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set
You've been begging and dying
For somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave you me
I'm coolin', teaching those needing schoolin'
And the mic? This mic in my hand? I'm rulin'!
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness

Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

Some MCs act bold and arrogant
Vain and using each other to compete with
These subjects I pity
Cause their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme that's so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste
But don't consider biting
There's penalties for those who don't do right
And just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not our fault your thoughts are shrinking
Well, mine are growing
Yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say
And even in spite of me
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness
Just call me "Your highness"
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness
You might also like
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble
You're begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious
The same as the pace
The crowds, they love me
The brothers give only hugs
Their shrink-to-fit button-flies fit quite snug
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging
Off the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex off the sounds that I'm pumping
I'm jumping with energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on, just get into it
Don't lie and say you've been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

The scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face
You don't want to feel the taste
Don't try to play me out
Cause I am not the one
Brothers on my bra strap
Sisters clocking my sound, why?
Because they wanna be down with the
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite
Don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteus maximus
Suckers on the tip
You're loving me, you're leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on, you know the time
Just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness2Embed
Uh, U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity
U.N.I.T.Y., love a black man from infinity to infinity

(Come on, come on, now here we go)
U.N.I.T.Y., love a black man from (Yeah, you gotta let him know)
Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, "Ha ha, yeah me, bitch," and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, "Who you callin' a bitch?" Yeah!

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependent see
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
You say I'm nothin' without ya but I'm nothing' with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not takin' it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gon' come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you wait and see (Who you callin' a bitch? Uh!)

Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

What's goin' on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a "gangsta bitch"
Now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe...hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)?
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this worth gettin' your face sliced
'Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
(Barking with no bite!)
She got to wear that for life
(Who you callin' a bitch? Uh!)
U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity (Here we go, you gotta let him know)

Oooh! Thing called Weekend Love!
Tony Rebel and Queen Latifah
I could live with it, baby
You know what I mean?
Watch this!

Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

If you've been misled
By anything I said
I didn't mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays through Friday's out - I'll see you then

A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
And a L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be

Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

Seems it's been so long
Since you filled me with your charms
I tenderly imagine me
Resting in your arms
But you've got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday through Friday's out - I'll see you then

Because we're sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
Sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
I know, you know
We are occupied
From our own love life
This has been denied
Many feelins high
Many tears of pride
But by the weekend
That must be rectified

Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love (maybe someday it will change)
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love

If you've been misled
By anything I said
I didn't mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday through Friday's out - I'll see you then

A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be
When we are absent, that is a  to present
To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods I am efficient
And I know you're possessed with the ingredients
During the week the days seems to be long
But on the weekend, wish the clock would reverse its hand
Great things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have
When we are together, 'cause we're spectacular
As if we never miss a second of the hour
When we are together, I sit and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever
Well then I think and I start remember
That we are-a just a...
Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend loveEmbed
Get funky with it

I told you before: you burn when you play with fire
So take off your hats, matter of fact hail the new Sire
You're hungry as hell, so i'm cookin up the chowder
It's laced with ingredients, gon' come on like gunpowder
Pom-pom! lick a shot, then I got to order
I'm runnin for the border for causin disorder
Pom-pom! lick a shot, got on my defenses
I'm runnin for the fences, of course I'm relentless
The particular name of this queen is Latifah
I've often been classified as a feminine teacher
Collectively capture the heart of a nation
Love my culture and show appreciation
You're lookin for the black influ'?
I do want to give it to you
What are you mad?
Give me some of what you had!
You can huff-huff, puff-puff and bluff-bluff
But I got nuff' of the ruff stuff
(Ruff and tuff)
(And all that stuff)
You might also like
Now nuff' of the ruff stuff, that's what I do, and I do it well
The proof is in the puddin, I show and prove, not show and tell
Talk tales, you get caught up in a crossfire
Buckshot must be what you want and desire
I write concepts, I don't be frontin or be buggin
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin
It's a love thang, the Queen doin her thang
If I was a liquid, you would drink me like Tang
You think I'm kickin things that I myself don't even heed?
I rap not for the love of music, but for greed?
"Latifah's booty, yo, she could never succeed"
Shiiit...
You watch me do it and boom it, the Flavor Unit will snap necks
You a-fi listen a likkle, you fi go buy the cassette
You're starvin, 'cause you ain't had enough
That's right, nuff' of the ruff stuff
(Ruff and tuff)
(And all that stuff)

You talk about flavor...
I got enough flavor to make a grapefruit sweet
Get old ladies jumpin out of their seats
Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun 'n rays
I got flavor for days
Now I'm the type that the fellas call a honey, and
From me you know you get a run for your money, and
This is no meaningless attack, I gave you a chance
Matter of fact, yo, I ordered them to dance
For me, they tried to turn me inside out
They felt the wrath of my madness, I let them come into my house
It's called Latifah's Law, for the criminal to curse
And all the gentlemen know its rule: ladies first
Not the typical female that tends to
Fall victim to the evil that men do
Small puff, I call your bluff
I'm not mad, I just had enough of the ruff stuff
(Ruff and tuff)
(And all that stuff)

Everybody know Latifah love positivity
Now positivity erase negativity
Mi comin inna di dance ???
Me rollin with the Flavor Unit posse
As a black woman, mi want equality
Equality, and di freedom to be me
Mi have a mother Rita, only call her Mommy
Likkle brother and sister, Angelo and Kelly
A brother in them laws, but mi call him Winki
Lost mi daddy and ??? family
??? black ??? black country
Believe in one God, one tribe, one destiny
Cease!Embed

Coming from the bitty bitty bottom of the basement
The first floor's a bore, so I’ll rise
Don't want to make it to the top too quickly
So I take step-to-step all the time
Take a look at the flow of the future
If you can't shake to it, then it don’t suit ya
Break off, back off, before I bust off
Bad is the worst, some are bad but soft
Bad this, bad that, who's bad enough?
For those who are bad, then batter up
I pointed this rap with my index
So baby, come on with a rag and some Windex
I'm stepping the step tryna meet me there
I'm avoiding all political fanfare
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista'

Who's a king, who's a queen, who's tryna bang?
I see myself as a queen but it ain’t for rank
This for all, not one, not for income
But for knowing who and where we descend from
I kick off with a choke, I come crazy new
They call me Mama Zulu but I won’t baby you
I'm not the type to look for a man with cash
But the only thing you get if you’re broke's a cast
I dip, then switch, what floor is this?
I go higher than a fire, try to diss
This is a little of my headed-for-top style
Rippin tracks, whippin' in fact, it's that wild
Right on flow, a few floors to go
I see suites instead of concrete, so
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista’
You might also like
Here's a knick-knack, sit back, hold ya hat
Here's a big rap, ya got close now get back
I got an army bustin through the enemy's wall
My thoughts on the situation was "fuck em all"
Salt-N-Pepa said it was time to grow
So me and Spin did 'em in, now time to go
Yo-Yo grabbed him, he said, "Hey, diddle diddle"
While I and Nikki got Monie out of the middle
Sisters in action, strong, real, still complete
I say "what up" cause you can't come or compete
The La, the Ti-Fah booms like a speaker
I hold more soul than a sneaker
Don't ask if I'm fast, I come swift, sis
Cause I'm passing an ass if you with this
If you down take a pounding from ya fist-a
For the sound of the nature of a sista'Embed
You ain't got no work for me (no work, no work)
Or any Flavor Unit MC (no work, no work)
You ain't got no work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got no work for the queen (no work, no work)

Don't try to get fly, y'all
We're blackin' up eyeballs
I run with a rough set, so don't get me upset
I gas you so hard, I leave you fartin'
You're soft as a buttercup, stupid ass, so why you startin'?
You're memorizing every damn lyric that I write
You're all up in my mouth every time I grab the mic
You need to learn a lesson from a female headbanger
Stop ridin' on my bra, you freakin' straphanger
Until we play Techs, but I always stay free
I made a resolution for you, 1993
It's all about the Flavor Unit and my family
'Cause I would die for all them and they would die for me
Leary about this intelligent female, all catch hell
An explanation of the Queen Latifah spelled well
So blow up and know me
Don't even contemplate a theory about jerkin' me

You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs (no work, no work)
Check it

Play me like a child, but you know I'm grown
See waterworks, so take your broke ass home

That was the way it started out back in the day
A little singin' joint with the hardcore phrase
Amazed I wouldn't diss another sister 'less she had it coming
And even then, I would take it to her face
My presence is stunning, cunning as a venus fly trap
'Cause, word up, I fight back, you're damn right, it's like that
So step back, I'm not the type of girl
You can run through and drop
I'm not the type of girl to be running to the cops
I know about everything that goes on on my block
And right beside my bed, I keep a Luger and a Glock
They're for the protection of a Flavor Unit queen
Me not gon' let ya go until me hear ya scream
I look in your eyes when I speak to your punk ass
I ought to put my feet to you

You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs (no work, no work)
Now, this wicked curse hurts
Spank your girls and boys, I'm annoyed
You gots no work, so I lurk to keep you unemployed
I'm a part of a tribe with a vibe
I scribe with nine lives, you're kicked inside outside
I used to ride the path across the tracks in your mouth
Until I jumped the turnstile and the conductor threw me out
You feelin' kinda horny? Call a clinic on that crotch
You's a dingy, dirty bitch, so I gotta Shout it out
I had it up to here, plus there
'Cause I'll be here plus there
We'll bump heads
There's nuff lumps everywhere
Nigga-niggas say the hood ain't changed
I get my niggies with the hoodies
Far from goody, but they're bad instead
We're ready for the worst things first
Anything you thought, I thought twice, thought through, and thought first
The queen picks the verse off a shirt
You hurt when I smirk 'cause you know first

You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for the queen (no work, no work)
You ain't got work for me (no work, no work)
You ain't got no work for the queen (no work, no work)
Nor any Flavor Unit MCs (no work, no work)
I said you ain't got no work for me (no work, no work)

Ladies, don't let them in if they don't have a condom

Some days I wake up grumpy
On other days, I let the brother sleep
But if there's no peace for the piece then
I say peace to the beast in heat
Let's talk about a Slim Jim jimmy chance in hell
If you can't protect a peck, your chances fail
That's just the pride I keep
He could great sideways, inside out
But still left on the side street
That's just a bare fact
My definition of bareback?
“Come at me bare? Don't come back”
Slap!
Try fittin' with a mitten
So you won't be trippin' and flippin'
And skinnydipping in the queen's kitten
So come and get candid
Kiss the candy
No claps, can't stand me if I offend he
You can't be saved by the skin on your teeth
But the skin on your friend
Could be your end, to say the least
Peace
And I won't give a thang
'Cause I'm down with the true crew
Down with the coochie bang

Slick, kick a groove
Don't show the trick in you
Fit the move smooth
Or forget it with the stick-and-move
And don't get tricky with the kissy poo
And don't say “don't be cruel” when I'm dissin' you
Kissin' you don't mean stickin' you
And If I was wishing to
Then you gotta know who I listen to
Like TLC
Me in heat
When lovin' me, couldn't care
If your hat was to da back, G
Don't turn the caution off
Turn it often
And don't say “always” then “often” and soften
Someday soon, you got to get to love what you got
Then you get love a lot
Get the point, yah?
You get faded like the face of any great sir
Slow down the fast pace, sir, until it's safer
And I won't give a thang
Because I'm down with the true crew
Down with the coochie bang

Some go from this one to that one
From wick-wick to wack one
You face one, you place one
The safe one's a strapped one
And I don't wanna buy my friends
Forget your promises and use your “condom” sense
Or I'm a glimpse
Then I'm gone, so long
The only thing that's on is your clothes
Now go home
And you can ho 'til the snow's gone
And I'll be here 'til the last hard head dead ho's gone
Either strap up or pack up is my motto
You say, “I wanna stay”
I say, “I know, yo, but bye, go”
Let's take it to the extent
If you love her, when you rub her
Brother, take her hint (word)
And I won't give a thang
Because I'm down with the true crew
Down with the coochie bang
Brothers better strap they thang-thang
Ladies, don't let them in if they don't have a condom

That's me, that's me
Who brings the flavor?
That's me. I got it

Oh no, it's a scandal, I drop upon the mic like an anvil
And they'll praise me for mad thoughts, I'm crazy
I'm searchin', lookin' for the target
You don't know what hard is, this ain't all this hard yet
But I don't wanna be hard, I just wanna flow
'Cause rhymin' is my game and I play it like a pro
So whatchu wanna know? My name?
Dana Elaine, all hail the queen acclaimed
Drive you insane, woman with a brain
I'm a Flavor Unit MC
And that means I'm one of the roughest, def-est, toughest, best-est
Wickedest MCs rappers in the place
But if you try get swift? I'ma punch you in your face
I'ma higher flier, why you wanna cry?
I'm already hot, so put me in the fire
Give me a pen and pad and it's over, bye-ya!
See ya later, alligator, hey D, bring the flavor

Record go, yo, watch the pro, let me flow
I'm raking in the dough on the down low, so me no know
Don't get me riled, I get wick-wick-wild
Flex styles by the pile, so smile for awhile

I'll put your best to a test (wanna bet?), wanna bet you'll blow it?
I'll smoke you like a cigarette, just give me the mic
I'll give you wreck and save your idle threats for the next rap
I'll take it without the cream, so leave it black
But you can leave the sugar, so I can make green-like-a-booger money
In the bank, no need for actin' stank
It's a sad thing to watch you get gassed like a tank
And spank, look at the intelligent female I N I
Don't try it, you know I don't buy it
Now, uh, if your get-up-and-go done got up and gone
I wrote this song so you can rock the hip-hop all night long
So I want a gigawatt in the back of your Jeep
So I can blast the shoes off your crusty feet

Ay yo Manda
What's up La?
Yo, people have been trying to get fierce on me
I think it's time I tell them about themselves
Yo, just give it to them Safari Style

Well, well, well
It's the L A the T I the F A H, you'll see why
Q U double E N. Is the reason I must be myself
What else? Well fame hasn't got me
Souped up selling out, sloppy or poppy
There so much to live for, therefore
Here's more from a woman
All women keep the rumors to yourself
The over blown home grown not known
Fools who never shown proof let alone own
A lot of props or a hip hip pop chart
Notch on your clock is my spot
Now who got the Mott’s?
Why you little played out
Aa-choo!
I'm allergic to wack crews
The La, the ti, the fah
The queen is up
Throwing salt that you never seen before
How dare those who talk we can't have them
Some make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum
But a wise, civilized and growing higher
Judgments from the Queen punishment is the fire
I'm here to make these fools out of liars
You must learn step and respect the sire, face the fire
Latifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear, fear
The sound is playing like a Q-tip digging your ear ear
Mama Zula stands for positivity, knowledge and grace
I never run my piece Damn! I'll take it to your face
Open why you hoping none stutter stop 'em
Maybe choke (choke)
Because it's very hard to breathe while La got you in a yolk
I'll cut your throat, I'll cut it short
No one ever getting near
Latifah's had it up to here

Some of these commercial entertainers
Are commercially a pain to my mind and my behind
Try to dis Dana, bumping me off
Because the Queen has reached a certain plateau
All I do is boo and say "Is that so?"
Talk is cheap and if talk got any cheaper
They'd be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers
Kay sa rah sa rah, blase bla, etcetera
This is a scene from the Queen La, La
Lovely and lyrically loose, but lady like
Im too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
Chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose I got
When Im in town I give the boosters booster shots
Breaks breaks, face face, never never, waste waste
Your mind on a rhyme
That will get thrown in your fronting face
I'll cut your throat, I'll cut it short

Face the fire boy
You wouldn't get the time of the day
So make way, hey, silence I say
Lay low and have a cold one
Cause the whipping I'm dishing is an old one
I through some soul into my morning bowl then I rolled
I took your gold and stopped your singled
Cause it never ever sold
Matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout
So you could never give me body or come in my house
The flavor unit is doing it back again this year
How many flavors of the flavor can you love to hear
Feel the force of my holocaust I'm staring at ya
Put in a bid on who will fall I'm sure to match ya
Snatch ya stature
Your broken looks more like a fracture
Catch that rapper
Latifah will be back to crush ya
Go buy a heart
Cause from the start I told ya no one getting near
Latifah's had it up to here
Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?

(It's got me goin' crazy, things are goin' crazy)

Forgive me Father for I have sinned
I just destroyed another phony ass rapper again
She wasn't causin' it
She must be stupid as a fiend
They should have told the child 'You don't step to the Queen!'
Perplexed and I'm vexed 'cause everywhere I go
People be flexin' expectin' me to wanna flow
I don't play that, the only way that
I would be playing is if I pay back
And run the playback, so whatcha sayin'?
You don't wanna be a sista' in the name of rap
And yet you wanna talk shit and your style is wack
I would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead
But now I'm fed, so it's off with your head
Now
The moral of the verse is your career is through
And don't be fuckin' with nobody who ain't fuckin' with you
If I was in yo shoes I'd let the BS start walkin'

A brotha pushed up on me at the movies one weekend
He was on a quest and I was who he was seekin'
And although I am Black and he was a Puerto Rican
Ain't make no diff to me, so we continued to speak and
We hit it right off and everything was on a roll
Before I knew it, I fell in love with his soul
"Aye papi! Aye!" Was the cry as he made love to me
I was freaked by the way he used to do me
And then one day when I was washin' our clothes
A number fell outta his pocket and her name was Rose
A girl's number? Hmmm. That struck me kinda funny
I lost my grip, I had to call up the honey
"There was a chick on the side!" Oh no it couldn't be!
"There was a chick on the side!" He's down with OPP?
I gave you the whole shabang
Just to find another woman hittin' my thang

I can't understand, I can't understand

I can't understand, I can't understand

Why the negative vibes? And why do people take bribes?
I don't understand it, yo (I don't know)
Why do bad people live? And why do good people die?
Somebody gotta tell me why  (I don't know)
Why do people smoke crack? And why do White fight Black?
What's that scenario?  (I don't know)
Why do hearts get broken? Why the chumps get choked?
They know I ain't no joke  (I don't know)
Now, with the drums to the bass to the piano to the horn
It's a crazy ass life and that's my word, it's bond
I'm tryin' to be as logical as I possibly can
But for the life of me, you know I just can't understand
What's goin' on sometimes
So situations like this come out in my rhymes
But Queen Latifah ain't gone just yet
'Cause when it comes to masterin' confusion I'm a VET

I can't understand, I can't understand
I can't understand, I can't understand

To all the coons, I say hi-de-ho
Produced by the mighty pro
Crazy Kay Gee kickin' hits like Karate Joe
Always with the mind every time to
Blame it on the Whitey so
See just Black and White?
There's no room for that in the '90s, yo
I'm still a bill and still checkin' mics, one-two
A whole year later, made you wait 'til the album's through
So many controversies over the language in rap
It wasn't a cuss that started a fuss
Now that's just a Black thing
Figure of speech is one thing
But enough of those reruns
Callin' sisters this and tricks
You gotta be one to see one
And sisters, brothers ain't all to blame, this may help
'Cause no respect is given to those who cannot respect self, see?
The queen has spoken
Yeah, I'm yokin', my head is hot
My style is like me shootin' hoops
Yeah, I better drop

This is one of my all-time flavor-ite tunes
Dissin' the Latifah? What this for?
You'd better off rammin' your head against a brick wall, Seagal
Time to rag that asset from corner to cassette
Chumps come try to trash it and see how far that gets
On the rhymin' tip, I ain't no joke
Singin' tip? Golden throat!
I hold a note so long, here's a ransom note
Prepare for war the worst who's first sharin' a
Glock, lick shot from Africa, bust 'em at America!
I never bite my tongue
This is what some long nights have done
Bitin', to me, don't even sound like it might be fun
Start with a change of heart and save all that sorry, child

I ain't a dizzy dolly that
Takes a line and splatterin'
No happenin' when it's probably wack
Don't approach the queen like she's a skeeze
'Cause I am way past that
Makin' my own, savin' my own
Is why y'all always find me stacked
Keepin' my cool, speakin' my mind
And givin' it all I got, alright?
Bustin' buffoons, peekin' to find
Who's goin' left and playin' right
Lovin' my crew, bringin' 'em up
Leadin' 'em all to somethin' great
Want to be sure
One may not have
But since I'm strong
My clique is straight
And I could never go out like an exit
'Cause my fans stick behind me
And they wouldn't expect it
I'm level-headed, head-to-head
I'm headed straight to Harlem
Though I'm not dreaded, dread the dred
If they're not there, you call 'em
I need my brothers and sisters
With me, standing hand to hand
Band to band, we're off land to land and
Buyin' much property, properly, pronto, please
That's the only way a Black business starts, you see
Name callin' hasn't fallen into what I'm runnin'
I wouldn't diss another sister 'less she had it comin'
One time, I'm chill when I sing it
You think that you can swing it? Then bring it

Yes baby
Strictly on the Latifah tip, I'm saying
A Yo they don't know nothin' about this here
Yo This Queen Latifah in the house
I got my man Heavy D, My Boy Treach and My Boy KRS-One in the house
To Rip some shit with me right quick

The quicker committee gettin' witty for many 'cause the war ain't won
This the city where I'm from, I'll glue ya titties to ya tongue
It's on like this switch, It's Big, Big, Big Hit, The Black Bleep, the rip
Smokin' Shit with mad misfits
The one man, one mold, Murder 1
Murder gold, one hard headache to hold
Word to god, it's good as gold
If it ain't rough, it ain't ashy & brick thick
And if it ain't nasty, Naughty's pissin' on your picnic
Rough is the place, the space, knuckle which way you think
Here to put a fat black nose back on the Black Sphinx
I don't shoot the gift, bitch, will slaughter your Christmas
I shot St. Nick and stuck him for the gifts I ain't get
No one under 17 admitted, so I came 18 deep

Follow me massive! Follow me massive! Follow me crew! follow me crew!
KRS-One in the party just a gwan and wanna (ease up)
Here we go, yo, you Know the flow, I get high & low
You Know, why you wanna flow with the pro? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Breakin' rappers in half by the ass is my only task
Gold & platinum plaques will pass, only talent will last
I come to the party prepared to kick ass
You come to the party well prepared to get scared
You're through and need stitching up, you and your crew'll start bitching up
Where you gonna live around where I'm not stompin' it?
I really believe you're a wee bit ova confident
On MTV, you wanna down rate me quick, yeah I'm a hypocrite
When you in my face, you on my dick
Consequently your lyrics don't fit, get a grip
You straight on some sucka shit
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)

Here comes the queen, I'll make a woman on the track get attracted like a fiend to the beat so I rap
You're looking for a friend to the end? Good, that me
But if you're looking for a gangsta bitch
That's exactly what you're gonna see
Ain't no way, ain't no say, this ain't your lucky day
So go pray, now you pay,  'cause I don't fuckin' play
Matter fact, I think Ice-T, he put it just right:
"You diss me on record? You see me? Fight!"
Just throw up the joints and get to the point
And cut all the talk, the BS can walk
'Cause I ain't here to waste my breath
You test my skills, you gettin' put to ya death
I'm sick of all the huff, puff, blow your house down bullshit I heard last week
You get ya ass beat
So watch the way you approach the Queen
If it ain't rough I'll send that ass to the guillotines

If It ain't rough (I could do without it)
If It ain't rough (Just throw it to the curb)
If It ain't rough (He could do without it)
If It ain't rough (It's working my nerves)
If It ain't rough (I could do without it)

You ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you ain't gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me, you can

My girlies caught me on a good day
I was bored, in the mood for jugs
So we took it to a club
Thinking we would mingle a little
And plus, at the time, I was single a little
So I said "Fine, we could meet up about nine"
So anyway we goes in the place
Word up, it's flowing
We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we know and
The people in the joint is yelling, "Hurt me! Hurt me!"
I'm working my way over to the bar, 'cause I'm thirsty
And then I see this guy
Oh no, I think he sights me!
I smile 'cause he's fly
He smiles back, I think he likes me!
But then it takes a twist
He sends his homeboy to talk to me
'Cause he's scared to get dissed
I don't bark, baby?!
I don't bite neither!
You could have asked me yourself
For my number to my beeper
The worst thing I'd have said was "no"
So maybe next time
You better push up like a pro, bro

Saturday, cooling in the house
Looking at the videos
At the same time, I'm trying to put on my clothes
First date! First date!
With a guy, his name was Nate
(Was he fly?) Yes he was
(Word up?) The type you have on a plate, cuz
I only met him last night
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right
So he rolls up at my door in a twenty-four-foot limo
What is all this for?
Are we expecting more?
He showered me with gifts and
Then he kissed me on my hand?
Now what was in your plan?
I really didn't understand
We're only going to the movies
Either you're trying to impress me
Or else you're trying to get the cooty
Listen baby, I don't want a condo
You can make me smile a little and give me convo
All I might require from a man is intelligence
And all them other material things is irrelevant
You ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you ain't gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me, you can
You ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out, I only wanna find out
I only want to find out, I only want to find out
Just find out who you are

Now if you ready to deal
With a girl who considers herself a queen
And you know how to treat a queen
Then step to the scene
And chill with the shyness and the pride, baby
'Cause life is beautiful with the Highness by your side
Maybe we can sit alone in a room and deal
We can take a ride listening to music and chill
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you
But you ain't gotta be no superstar, honey
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are
Money ain't gon' make me love ya
And neither will your car
So cease with the latter two
With that attitude you won't be getting far
And I love all of my brothers with a passion
Can't a sister get the same type of reaction? (Yeah)
If you're cool like that
Take a trip to Jersey, 'cause that's where I'm at
You ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you ain't gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me, you can
You ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And you ain't gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me, you can

No you ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to know just who you are
No you ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to know just who you are1Embed
Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night
Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night

When I met you, the first thing I thought was, “Sexy!”
I didn't judge, though, figured I'd wait and see
We had convos 'til the break of dawn and
I intrigued you, you fascinated me
You told me all about the freak in you
Figured I was seeking you
And I couldn't wait to get a peek at you
But I'm the type that thinks that sex is best
When you're in love with more than the physical specimen
So I waited for your heart to get in touch with mine
And waited longer just to make sure it was genuine
And now I see you're on the real tip
Baby, I can feel it every time you hold me with a tight grip
It's true, it's all about you
You got too much love for me to ever need two
I'm ready to let you love me all night now
Come on, baby, right now

Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night

All I ever wanted was a strong brother like you
That's why I hold on to your love
'Cause you're the earth and I stay down to it
Just like this beat, I expound to it
I live a very hectic life, but I'm glad you understand
'Cause when it starts to stressin' me
You see it comin' and forgive my moods and my attitudes
'Cause you know how the pressure be
Then you massage my body
Every single inch of me to relieve the stress in me
You've got a way of getting next to me
You've got me offering the rest of me

Gotta get up when the mood is right
I'm ready to let you love me all night
Baby I know that I can do it right
All night, all night, all night
'Til the break of morning light
Alright

Many thought they was gettin' kitten fast in the past
Make me purr and then jet in a blur
I don't think so, 'cause I don't think "ho"
They didn't get laid, 'cause I don't get played
But baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
And it's for Y-O-U for eternity
Now that's how my mama said it's supposed to be
Affairs, flings, and those type of things come along
But I'm putting on a ring for my king
'Cause you bring it strong
So let's be on our merry way
I'll give you love without a limit like Mary J
It's true, it's all about you
You got too much love for me to ever need two
I'm ready to let you love me all night now
Come on, baby, right nowEmbed

Before you even try to diss me
Let's get something clear
There ain't no fear between you and me or the atmosphere
Hail to the queen and the sire

Smoother than my body buck naked

What a beautiful day and I'm riding down the highway
On my way to the studio, gotta go 'cause I slept late
I just came back from cool ass Cali
Where Mandy was bumpin' MC Ren's 'In the Alley'
Driving so fast that no one could catch me
While I'm knocking "Gangsta Bitch" by Apache
This is the mood for making the hit hip-hop song
You should have known it was on
The places I've been, the people I've seen
And everywhere I go, it's “Give it to 'em, Queen!”
'Cause hip-hop is for real, I'm dealing with the truth
'Cause all over the world, it's aggravated youth
So every time I grab the mic, you know that I could rock it
So I can have some fun and put some money in my pocket
You can always know the time, just recognize the sign
Can't nobody put a padlock on your mind

Take a trip on back into the third verse
Of the originator of the concept of ladies first
You came along and tried to freak mine
To the contrary, 'cause I'm not your ordinary piece of feline
See I know the book because I read it twice
If I bite the hook, then I'ma pay the price
Mama taught me Black was beautiful when I was young
And told me all about where babies really came from
So you can hit the door with the theory
That all Black women are hoes, hear me?

This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki (Search and find, search and find, search and find, search and find)
Who's lookin' down on me from Heaven (What’s on your mind? Search and find)
Watchin' my every move as usual (What’s goin' down? Search and find)

There but for the grace of God, do I go? Do I go?
There but for the grace of God, do I go? Do I go, go?

I'm tryin' to take my time on this rhyme
But it's bustin' from the seams
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams
Movin' all around, oh, yes, I'm makin' leaps and bounds
There's so much you can say, no time to write it down
I'm skippin' to this and skippin' to that
I've overflowed my cup
I'm flowin' kinda quick, I hope you can keep up
Everything ain't cool just 'cause you slap me on my hand
There's things about me all of y'all just got to understand
Latifah never was a teacher, never was a preacher
Never was a saint, never was conceited, never was defeated
Sometimes I get tired, sometimes I wanna faint
But I never shut up when things piss me off
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across
That's what I gotta do
That's how it gotta be
I got an angel watchin' over me

Search and find, search and find
What's on your mind? What's goin' down?
What's goin' down, runnin' room

It's time you find
What's goin' on in your mind
Try to find peace of mind
When your blind, world's unkind
Got to fight, keep the right
At the time, never gone
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Strive on, strive on, strive on
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Yes, he did, yes, he did

Happy new year, it's a new year
And I'mma tell you what I want you to do here
You gotta get up, you gotta get down
It's a jam and if you're square, you better get round
I got the Flavor, I got the Unit of 10 deadly MCs who fine tune it
Of the composer of this controversial literature
Stop! I think they call it hip-hop
The Q-to-the-U, the E, the E, the N
The L-A-T-I-F-A-H, I know it's hard to comprehend
But I'm identified as Latifah, you know?
The one that grabbed the mic and blew the speakers
So, so slide on the rhythm, 'cause it's slippery
Step on this here dance floor and see if you can get with me
I'mma rip stupidly for those who need to be reassured
As Nevelle gets funky on the keyboards

If you don't know where to find a party
You wanna learn how to shake that body
I got it here, this is your year
And you can do it, right here, right now

I'm Queen Latifah, and define (?) I'm anointing you
Blessing your mind with rhymes from an African point of view
Wanna see your neck turn in the direction I'm pointing to
All the way live, yes, that is the way that I come to you
When I start it off, I had to play the right tracks and
See the descrimination of the ones they call Black and
Indeed I was not the one to go for it
I put the pen to the pad and got a show for it
I got the Flavor Unit airing, always watching out
I do not cuss because my mommy said to watch my mouth
I keep you spinning, funking, jumping like a hula hoop
After we put the proper rhyme to a pumping loop
Now if you get down with the get down you'll be gettin' down
This is a hit and oh so hitting, and splitting sound
My lyrics added to some music make a perfect blend
But I think it's time I let the singing part come in
Come on!

I didn't know! (You didn't know?)
Well I was having too much fun
To the listeners, you know I thank you all
If you're like me, I know you had a ball
It brings me joy to see the party people working out
In case you didn't know, that's what this record's all about
So when you dance, remember to be positive
As we take it all the way to the bridge

Come on and dance
This is your chance, you might find romance
Be what you want to be
Baby, get crazy, come on get on the dance floor
For all you wanting more

Some weakness tells me when the morning comes
It's hard for me to try to see you're not the one

Cause what we got is good but want to make it better
Yo boo, I'm digging you, you got all of the equipment
Now I'm ready for a commitment
I'm not trying to rush things
Not looking for an engagement ring
But the queen needs a king
And I choose you, cause what we got is in tune
Since you promised me the moon I hope to see it soon

I want make this official man, I miss you
I feign for your touch and your kiss too

Boostin', tearin' off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again

Do you remember the first time I let cha get it
I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you

How do I love thee
Let me count the ways
How much do I love you
Well, multiply your love by infinity
Picture a vision of beauty
As we dance by the light of the moon
Your passion so often consumes me
Like the lick of a Native Tongue tune
Reality is ours to create
Fantasy is ours to mold
Dream my love dream
With my body and my soul
Question out my faith
I'm pledged to be your lover
And after I started loving you
I knew I'd never love another
I'm like a child within your arms
Would you come inside and play with me
Spend the day with me
Have your way with me

Remember this always
My sweet one
No lie is true
And dude it's not a lie
When I say that
I would die for you
You're so deep within thee
That sometimes your just a touch away
But I can't reach you
I seek you
Come to me
But then you"re all around me
You just surround me
And you astound me
And I recieve you
'fore I complete you
It pleases me
To have you touch me there

I didn't mean to turn you on (x8)

I can see it in your eyes
You wanna get down with Queen La
Lace Latifah, I can see ya eyes on my body parts
The friendship's slippin' cause it ain't me you hittin'
Why you trippin'?
Wishin' you could get a taste from the black Queen
It captivates the mass when I slide on the scene, yo
We ain't gettin' down like that
You took a hug to the next level, try to spit that
Counterfeit, nice shit put on the act trick
Try to get a quick kiss and you got snapped quick
I tried to be nice and play it all smooth
Well I guess done has somethin' to prove
So I had to move, getaway like a fugitive
Didn't wanna do the kid cause I knew the kid
Didn't really wanna do no harm
I don't know what I did but I didn't mean to turn you on

I took you out, I was only tryin' to be nice
Let you touch it once or twice
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on

Why apologize? I ain't do nothin' wrong
You knew what the deal was, what the real was
You was confused with the levels of love
I seen you in the club with your eyes on me
All night lookin' asinine, up under the strobe light
You on thin ice in steel-toed Timbs
When it break through I don't think we could be friends
If you sayin' you a playa, baby, live like one
You play yourself like a bomb, never gettin' none
And say beggin' for some and never get it
If I turned you on, I guess you gotta live with it

I didn't mean to turn you on (x8)

So what you mad now, got a attitude now
Cause I had to pull your foul?
Frontin' big Willie style when you're a major joke
Pagin' me so much till my pager smoked
Got your Eskimo kiss and shit
Your nose's too brown, how you get chicks to trip
Well I ain't the one, I could buy you and your whip
Hold your head cause I've got so many hits, what?

Why y'all ain't say—?!
Yo, you KNOW
You know you was supposed to say something to me
Ooh, baby baby!
Aww yeah
Clap your hands, y'all...

Check it!
Dig it while I rip it
Check it while I wreck it
(Give it to 'em, La!)
Okay, gimme a few seconds
First, I give a shout to every
Jersey-born-and-bred head
And everybody in New York
From brunettes to red heads
Who got my back? (Jersey got your back!)
Yo, tell me who got my back? (The Bronx got your back!)
Yo, tell me who got my back? (Brooklyn got your back!)
Yo-yo-yo who got my back? (Uptown got your back!)
Thank you as I come back into the beat
Give a shoutout to my brother L.A.N.C.E
Up in heaven, resting, chilling, watching over me
You know you're too good to be forgotten
Papa wasn't there but there was Lance in the house
And so, to me and Mommy, you the man of the house
Always flip the script back to the old days
I used to rock it on the high school stage
I used to drink 40s
Back then I didn't blaze
Switched to the pipe with the peace these days
Just go on to let you know I flow on
I'm wicked out my gluteus, so ho on and ho on (hoo-ooo)
That's what we about to do (hoo-ooo)
Take you on a mission with the Flavor U
Uh, me no deal with no dibby dibby flip flop
I get mad when it comes to playing hip hop
You might also like
But chill
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Just chill
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Yo chill
(gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh
(gimme five on the black hand side)
Come on chill
(gimme five on the black hand side)

Check it fear don't live in here
Tears don't bring me cheers
So gear for another year because I had it up to here
Yeah, I'm about through with you
You wack and rooty poo
Rip up a crew after I hear the one and the two
I'm ret' to set it off again
Wanna bet I can wreck you and your next of kin?
In fact, don't make me have to get the royal gatt
You best to get your narrow ass off that crack
We'll play any show and I know that I'll pack it
Attack it with my tactics
I'm loaded like a full metal jacket
I flip mines to get mines
I'm happy to get with you
But you can't come out to play right now
You got to much shit to do
It's all game
It all sounds the same
Them suckers know my name is
Sitting on the tips of their brains
But they're ashamed
They scared to face me
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me
They must be freaking crazy
I'm the La La La from Halstead
Bred with the Queen as a prefix
It's off with your head
And that's a promise 'cause I don't make threats
So mind your neck, 'cause it's about to get set
C'mon set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Somebody set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Watch the La, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Uh, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Watch the La, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)
Checks the Queen, set it off
(Gimme five on the black hand side)

Parlay
Ah uh, yeah (3x)
Black Reign, 1993
I'd like to welcome you to this album

A new day to hear me

Talking about sex in the '90s

My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me, my body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
Don't wanna get too complex
But does the stress come with the sex?
I know you wanna see me undressed
You're fiending to taste my sweetness
And since I'm your sex interest
It's 'bout time for me to confess
I wanna smoke you like buddha-bless
But my mind's like a bulletproof vest
It's a no/yes

My body's ready, my mind's blocked
It's gonna take a lot to reach my hot spot, I kid you not
I wanna set it and let you wet it, so come and get it
And when we're through you'll need a paramedic
No, never mind, my thoughts dip, you might trip or flip
And so instead I'm staying celibate
My body's ready, my mind's bugging, so I'm struggling
Do I need your love or your lovin'
I just don't know
You might also like
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me, my body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
Now I know that this could be a big blow
To somebody with a big ego
Who could get any ho' in E.O
But I got to put your status on slow
'Cause baby I don't know
If it's me or the TV show, my records or my videos
And got your nose wide open like blow
I just don't know

Now what are you prepared to do if I decide
To put away the pride and let you inside
Would you tell how good it felt
I made you melt, or keep your mouth closed and keep it to yourself
Who should I trust, my love or lust, body or mind, before you
Came along I was doing fine
On the other hand, you claimed to be the man, if I said no
Would you run? The last brother ran
Just don't...
(repeat chorus 2X)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me, my body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
Well I like it in the morning I suppose
I'm having wet-dreams and taking off my clothes
I can't front only a few brothers know
That I like it when the flow is slow
If it's wack then your rep's exposed, if it's right or do you
Till you explode
Hope your ready to catch my whole load, if you hit the right
Spot you've found the code
Do you know...
You be the object of my wet-dreams
Until my mind and my body can't breathe
I keep it tight and I keep it sexy
'Cause you wanna sex me
And if you wanna test the queen (sexually)
I'm trying to see my mind set free
'Cause cause my mind and body don't agree
I hope this is the spot where you wanna be
'Cause you gotta put in work to earn me
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me, my body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My mind keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
My body keep tellin' me
(Should I do it or don't do it?)
