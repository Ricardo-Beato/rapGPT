11 ContributorsWatch Your Mouth Lyrics* samples were not cleared for the official album release

Y'know? General, general! Word out...
Yeah...
Aiyyo man.. you poppin fuckers
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)

It's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block!
"From the gate now!"
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Aiyyo, it's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block, you can't fuck with the block!
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)

Aiyyo, I stay funky and piley, blue Excelero
They lookin for me, what the fuck you behind me for?
Stressing everything I breathe on
I'm from the boulevard where niggas get jacked and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lasers and glasses
Try to get my come up on
Yo, and when you see me, you know I got my "come up" arm on
Cartier called me up, robbery here
We got your seed in the back of the Beemer starving
We like lion killers, catch me on stage with the gauge
In my right hand, grenade and this leather bomber
I scout money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coughing out corner rappers, don't never walk up on me
I write with only insane Malkovich
My troops gave me money to clown with them, fuck it
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
You might also like
My first gun was a .32, back before uh!
Graduated to the .38, maybe a nine
I prefer the fo' five, stay alive
Techs held the crack gank in '88
8 oz. straight from Florida, the best temp
Camouflage vest, repping the set
Wu on the east wing, twenty-ten, sexy bad
We up at Spain with that thing thing, my crew strong
We take no search for your party dunn, you know how I run
Spray places, cover faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fuck out
Keep a nunchuk, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any motherfuckin contender
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)

Hey bitch, your time's up! Go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, settin the grind up
Police checkin them pies up, my rims are shined up
Wu! We on the rise up, crops supplied up
Plottin niggas demise up, boxed in conduct
Scratch we got 'em sized up, and when the East is in the house
You, you, you, you, you...
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
On the side of the projects, grey skully, bubble 'Lo goose
Mac 11 tucked in front of the belly
Prestigious moves, we killin 'em, hoes we drillin 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin 'em
In the van, .45's and dilly's, ready to slam it
House arrest box is goin off, Tony got grams
Gotta bath tub full of white, lay in it like Sam Montana
Tune 'em out, to blow out, chop 'em like fans
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)

This is boulevard hard, lounging in your black car
Camouflage rat guard on "Stomp the Yard"
I-N-S spit monster bars, flip long regards
My click dons bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like Tim off the glass
Slamming my name, I'm like the prez, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all their cash
I'm so Wu, so new that I ain't ripped off the tags
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)

RZA done birthed us, some curse on purpose
I'm the grouch, my mouth is a circus
Burner plus a good learner, don't need a hood
All I need's a good burner, Nat Turner
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Rack rooms full of goons with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang!) More results talkin 'bout whole crew's mission just lost
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You bein dragged across the floor while your 'dro in my hook
Lyrical joust, found all the deal off the books
Steve Rif gave the nod to Universal, good look
Still spit poison venom, Red Monkey and Wu dem
Have any dudes seen the condos? It's all 'em
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)

Put my +clan in da front+, +reunite+ 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
We parole as a whole, we'll send you back in fractions
Break through fanatic, low crates deep in attics
The Abbott pulled out a .45, looped with static
I scrolled through the menu then rolled to the venue
The dress code is armor all, put a hole up in him
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)2Embed
