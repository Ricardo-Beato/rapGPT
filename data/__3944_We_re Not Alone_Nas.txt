34 ContributorsWeâ€™re Not Alone Lyrics
Where there's life there is water
We depend on Mama Nature
There's a message for tomorrow
Everything connects to you
Some say soon it will be over
You can see it in the weather
Out of tune with Mama Nature
What you do comes back to you

We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

Uhh, uhh
Confucius, Confucius, Sigmund Freud
And Farad Muhammad, is it evolution or God?
Searching for the truth is a threat
Seems the closer we get to the truth State Troopers or Feds
Come out to silence you, my house in Malibu probably tapped
'Cause living next door to Demi Moore, plus I'm black
Plus I want vengeance for the poor who's attacked daily
Patriot Act never scared me
Jake in the Taurus, sticky in the jar-as
Niggas I'm with got warrants
America's browning, 20 years from now every town'll be brown and Latin
An African looking Manhattan
I'ma tell you what I seen with my three eyes
Word to me, not a hoax back in '99
A spacecraft in the skyline
In L.A. in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying
You might also like
Every mother every father
Raise your sons and your daughters
With respect and with honor
From the seed comes a fruit
It's an unbroken circle
All of life is universal
And we're all in the struggle
If I know one thing is true

We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

Evidence remains in debate
Documents of our own Air Force base
Additional terrestrial information
Other planets with life population, my observation
Scientists study pictures of a flying disk
Right on earth anthropologists are finding shit
Visitors probably live with us, they can mimic us
It's sort of what we're seeing in the cinemas
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
It's good to be alive
(It's good to be alive)
Nobody is an island
We are part of an environment
Only way we're gon' survive
Is if we harmonize

We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

Reginald Lewis, the black billionaire
Before Oprah, Bob Johnson, how'd he disappear?
Conspiracy theories, UFOs in the air
I've seen it with my own two eyes, and I swear
Like Warren Buffet, real money I'm just trying to touch it
The diamond encrusted shit, live illustrious
'Cause we was deprived of it, suffered
Now we pop to prove anything's possible
My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us
Now we diddy bop just to show you that our strength's up
Just when niggas 'bout to see they cut
Global warming about to burn us up
Niggas never really seen paper in this world
American blacks, the teenager of this world
Give us 20 more years to grow up, already geniuses
What I mean is this
I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer
'Til I read the words of Ivan Van Sertima
He inserted something in me that made me feel worthier
Now I spit revolution, I'm his hood interpreter
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
It's good to be alive
(It's good to be alive)
Nobody is an island
We are part of an environment
Only way we're gon' survive
Is if we harmonize

We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone
We're not alone

Ayo I'm American born, love America
Love my people, love all mankind, all nationalities, you know
I think it's just recently where everybody just started to feel
Like there was an elite group that runs everything
And everybody else was sheep, ignorant
Making all ethnicities, colors and creeds
Niggers, blind to what really is going on
So I say take off the wool from your eyes
Out with the old America in with the new
End all racism, all injustice, all oppression to poor people
Any people anywhere in this planet
Let's come together: a new day is rising5Embed
