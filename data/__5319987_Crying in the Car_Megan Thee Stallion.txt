Money to make and we all gon' spend it
Takin' care of my team, they wit' me
Can't complain, can't do no trippin'
Sayin' a prayer and I know he hear me
People keep sayin' I should be the bigger person
Who's gonna worry 'bout me when I'm hurtin'?
Got one more time, keep talkin' that shit
And I'ma wild out and go hard on a bitch
I been stayin' up all night
My niggas in the street, I'm makin' sure they're alright
And if I tell 'em it's a issue, then it's on sight
I'm on point, let me show you what that aim like

Shit ain't the same and you say I'm changin'
But I really think it's you
Mad at me 'cause I'm elevatin'
But what you wanted me to do?

Please don't give up on me, Lord, Lord
Promise to keep goin' hard, hard
All of them nights that I cried in the car
All them tears turned into ice on my arms
Please don't give up on me, Lord, Lord
Promise to keep goin' hard, hard
All of them nights that I cried in the car
All them tears turned into ice on my arms
You might also like
And that's why I keep goin' harder
And harder (Ayy)
And that's why I keep goin' harder
And harder (Ayy)

Nigga, why you wanna play with me?
And why your girl look like she got somethin' to say to me?
He a snake and you layin' in the snake pit
'Cause he the type of nigga fuck a bitch I'm cool with
I don't want to talk and I barely wanna listen
Niggas playin' tag and they all tryna get me
Gotta stay focused, gotta stay winnin'
Young bitch just tryna make these millions
You know ya really motivatin' me
I'm really happy that you mothafuckas hate me
All them hoes get quiet when I walk in
They don't bother me, I know them bitches ain't shit

Shit ain't the same and you say I'm changin'
But I really think it's you
Mad at me 'cause I'm elevatin'
But what you wanted me to do?
Please don't give up on me, Lord, Lord
Promise to keep goin' hard, hard
All of them nights that I cried in the car
All them tears turned into ice on my arms
Please don't give up on me, Lord, Lord
Promise to keep goin' hard, hard
All of them nights that I cried in the car
All them tears turned into ice on my arms

And that's why I keep goin' harder
And harder (Ayy)
And that's why I keep goin' harder
And harder (Ayy)

And that's why I keep goin' harder
And harder (Ayy)
And that's why I keep goin' harder
And harder (Ayy)4Embed
