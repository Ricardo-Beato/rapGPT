8 ContributorsMustard & Mayonaise Lyrics
Ooh, I'm a hot girl but these niggas think I'm cool
Partied all night then woke up and went to school
A real bad bitch, I look good in a suit
A lil' model booty but that motherfucker move

Ain't a thing you can name that I want and ain't get (Not shit)
Got some head from your nigga then I check that off the list (Lil' bitch)
Make him feel like he my man when he know he just a trick (Ah-ah)
He be paying this tuition and I never let him hit (Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm giving niggas the chills (Chills), sexy like Pamela Grier
Conceited, I stay in the mirror (Goddamn), I'm wiping hoes out like it's smears (Ah)
I pull up with Kel in a Benz (Skrrt), your baby daddy get in (Mwah)
He wanna lick it again (Ah), he spoil me like I'm a lil' kid
Panties and the fur, pull up with a chauffeur
Peanut butter insides like I ride a dessert (Ride a dessert)
I prefer head over sex, cash over checks
If a bitch get me wrong, got the autocorrect
Don't slip but my flow wet, hit a boy vest
If he put me to bed, now he under arrest
Lock you down now that mouth mine, turn him to a mime
He ain't talked in a minute 'cause his tongue doin' time (Ah)

Looked at my phone and the money just text me (Ayy, woah)
Dinner with the plug, I ain't hungry, I'm finessing (Hungry, I'm finessing)
Barely speaking English but I know he understand me (Know he understand me)
Hand over that money 'cause he know it make me happy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm a dream girl but I don't do no singing (Uh-uh)
Heard he got that work so I put him in a meeting (Ayy, what's up?)
Say he only eat his girlfriends, tryna tease me (What?)
But I peeped him out so I know he finna drink me (Yeah)

Ooh, I'm a hot girl but these niggas think I'm cool
Partied all night then woke up and went to school
A real bad bitch, I look good in a suit
A lil' model booty but that motherfucker move

I got more business in your mouth than a dentist
I'm the baddest bitch walkin' 'round on campus
Some tired niggas on my line, "Let the call through"
Got a condo but like to kick it in my dorm room
Hair pulled back, no bra, in a blazer (Yeah)
Let a nigga know a lil' money don't phase you (Yeah)
If you ain't talking numbers, I'ma holla at you later
'Cause I'm into gettin' money, baby, I don't wanna lay up (Uh-uh)

Bitch, you a L, I'm a win (Woah)
Here, you can have back your man (Yeah)
He know Thee Stallion a ten (Ah), I get more neck than a chin
Yeah, I be actin' a ass (Yeah), I be hungover in class (Ugh)
My professor think I'm bad (What?), so he gon' give me a pass (Ooh)
I heard you was a freak, I'm tryna see if that shit true
You heard I was a player, what that got to do wit' you?
I'm tryna see what's up with that, baby, if it's cool (Let me know)
Stop actin' like a rookie, I know you know what to do
Ooh, I'm a hot girl but these niggas think I'm cool (Ayy)
Partied all night then woke up and went to school
A real bad bitch, I look good in a suit
A lil' model booty but that motherfucker move1Embed
