107 ContributorsOn & On Lyrics
Yeah, momma I just booked a first-class ticket
To my destiny, by the way, yeah

Maybe I'ma fly away
Maybe I'ma fly away, some day

Yeah, so gullible just like my first love
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up
Picked up the pen, and that's when I drew my first blood
Spill my heart again, 'cause the pain'll never end
Happiness is temporary, always has been
I just lost one, but sometimes, I win
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end
Always kept like 47 friends in my circumference
All that’s left now is the radius
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere
This is my moment of truth, right here
Swear I ain’t scared of no man, I see the omens
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'
The omnipresence is omnipotent
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done
I show all my soul purpose, but I’m pretty sure there's one
There’s a reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun
This the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son
You might also like
So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone
And read: "Here lies a G," followed by a poem (Oh, oh)
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling wrong
Went with both shoulders that my head is always on
I charged through harm's way, carried boulders on my arms (My arms)
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms (Many storms)
That rain on my parade, seen the doves cry for days
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gates
Though Steezy told about me, yo, I know he always watching
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip-hoppers
I really miss my partner
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2Pacs, and a big L, rolled proper
And that's a big pun
Know that I'ma join him when my time come
But the story just begun
So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

One day, I'ma fly away
One day, I'ma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day, you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day, we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
Let's just go...
My clouds gray, I hope my pain don’t show (No)
Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go (Oh)
They say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold’s will show (Show)
Even skating down the block don’t feel the same no more (No more)
If I ain’t looking, I still see it all
My vision’s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls
They stay scheming, y’all like the sheep to the shepherd
The trees to the leaves, you needed but not needed (Mm, mm)
So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
I’m not eating, not blaming, I’m just saying
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking
They too fake
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty
Long as Rawle and Whitney seen different cities, different titties
All with no money with me
I'm on my grind, man, no regrets when I die, man
'Til we fly, man, 'til we fly, man, 'til we fly, man
You gon' miss us when we fly, man
So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

One day, I'ma fly away
One day, I'ma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day, you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day, we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)66Embed
