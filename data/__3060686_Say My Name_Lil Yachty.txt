I want you to say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name right now
I want you to say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, baby, say my name, baby say my name loud
I want you to say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name in the crowd
I want you to say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, baby, say my name, loud

I'm about to kill this scene
Got a Billie Jean by my side
And my wrist on bling blaow
I got pictures in the magazine
Gettin' chauffeured 'round
While my bad bitch smokin' on loud
If you had seen half the shit I've seen
You would prolly fiend, for a taste, for a taste of the clout
Always number 9 on a nigga jeans
Gang, gang so deep walkin' 'round like I'm walkin' with the crowd

Uh, I want you to say my name, say my, say my name
Say my name, say my, say my name, say my name now
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name, say my name loud
I want you to say my, say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name in the crowd
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name right now
Say my name now
Say my name loud

Every time I wake up, I read silly things
Internet tryna take a nigga, take a nigga out his clout
All these bitches hatin' on a nigga dreams
Tryna make sure they do anything to make sure that I fail
I just hit a lick on the runway
I'll be back before Sunday
Gotta get this money now
My brother used to sleep in a Hyundai
Now he spent about a hundred G's on a fun day, wow
And just when I thought about giving up
I got slapped in the face with a blessing slap like pow
And fresh as hell on my bum day
I look fresher than a nigga do on their b-day, wow

I want you to say my name, say my, say my name
Say my name, say my, say my name, say my name now
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name, say my name loud
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name in the crowd
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name right now4Embed
