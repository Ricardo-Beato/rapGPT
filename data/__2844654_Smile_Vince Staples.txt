52 ContributorsSmile Lyrics
How you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I lay
So can you do me a favor, smile for me?

I know they wanna see me fall, I know they fraudulent, I know
I know they hoping that it's right back to the ghettos I go
I know my pigment is not that of a businessmen
I know they think I'm ignorant, I'm fucking up my privilege
I know that money come and go so money not my motive no mo’
I made enough to know I'll never make enough for my soul
I turned my back on my friends
I turned my back on my home
I left the streets where I've grown
To chase the yellow brick road
I heard they paved it with gold, I turned around and seen they pissed on it
Just like me
But that's alright because my soul burning, please set me free
I hope to see you in another life time, mines just not for me
Can’t you see?

Every night up on my knees I pray
Smile for me
That everything will change and be ok
Smile for me
Maybe I'll stay, maybe I'll pass away
Smile for me
I'm holding on to what the pastor say
Smile for me
You might also like
Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
'Cause when life gets hard
And you just think
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
When life gets hard
And you can’t breathe
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
Smile for me

How you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I pray
So could you do me a favor, smile for me?

I don't love you, you don't love me, we should give it up
Wish I felt your body without me getting my feeling's touched
People tell me I'm too young and I should live it up
How could you not feel that? These freaks wanna give it up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Don't say you feel my pain cause I don't even feel myself
Blood rushing through my brain, sometimes I wanna kill myself
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Motion of the ocean waves capsize me, baptize my frame
Salt water inside my wounds, still don't know who to blame
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up11Embed
