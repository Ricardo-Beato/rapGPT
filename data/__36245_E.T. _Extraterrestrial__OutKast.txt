45 ContributorsE.T. (Extraterrestrial) Lyrics
Peep what I say
Everyday the sun sets just like clockwork
To put the Glock to work
And putting the body to standstills
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss, niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling
Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
Still yet they tend to flex, like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing, no-no, not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit, we done a bunch of shit
And yes ya heard of this out of this world like E.T
Coming across ya T.V
Extraterrestrial - straight from ATL

Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world

Right now I'm smiling, taking advantage of this moment
Cause there might not be another soon
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars
Tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker
But to you I may appear to be your average Joe
But little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things
Maybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing
Keeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring
Extraterrestrial, out of this world
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world2Embed
