8 ContributorsStardust LyricsI should've listened to Clarence
How did we get so careless
You should’ve listened to the old classics
Those freestyles was written on some stone tablets
I'm such a passive aggressifist
We practice abstinence
It's for the best I guess
I’m so sensitive she calling me a bootyhole
And now I'd rather sleep down at the studio
Stop biting my rap style
My life has never been so gorgeous so turn me up until my voice gеts distorted
I'm exhausted but I'm far from harmlеss
I'm trying to be a better partner regardless
So why you make me wanna turn back into stardust
Broken hearted
