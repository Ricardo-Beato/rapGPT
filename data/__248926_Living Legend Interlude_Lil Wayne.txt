5 ContributorsLiving Legend Interlude Lyrics
Whats poppin'? Whaddup 5?
The problem with me is i believe in you too much
Whoo! Ya heard me? We in this bitch
Uh.. I dont really consider myself a living legend
Because uh... Sometimes legends arent true
So... And sometimes i dont even feel like im living
So... To answer the question about what it is to be a living legend
Uh! Honestly i wouldn't know
But what it is to be Lil Wayne; its amazin' its awesome
I wouldn't give it up for the world
Ya dig?You might also likeEmbed
