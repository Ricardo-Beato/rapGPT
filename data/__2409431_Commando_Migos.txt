54 ContributorsCommando Lyrics
(De-De-De-Deko)
They said it was called the trap
(OG Parker)
But on the Northside, we call it the bando
You ain't know
Nah, for real

All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando (Grah)
We the first ones that came up with the bando (Bando)
Talkin' 'bout you got the Act', but what it goin' for? (Act')
I'm 'bout to start extortin' niggas for that Migo flow (Ayy)
We the ones that really came in with the kickin' doors (Boom)
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold ('Sace)
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car, then why the fuck you rent it for? (Bitch)
All of my niggas, they ready to get you and hit you and split you and never leave no witness to see you
And if you thinkin' 'bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister, that chopper hit you, havin' a seizure (Ayy)
I been teachin' niggas lingo like I'm a teacher
Mamacita, she lookin' like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked 'em up with the dab, so we goin' up on the feature
All of my bitches, they piped up and conceited (Take-Take-Take-Takeoff)

All rose gold on, call it Rose Bowl (Rose)
I got the key, unlockin' the game like a cheat code (Cheat)
Fuck a bad bitch, I'm fuckin' with the fleek hoes (Fleek)
And I'd never give my soul up for a bankroll (Nah)
Niggas get lucky, standin' right there by that rainbow (Leprechaun)
No rain, though, I'm in a Yung Rich Nation raincoat (Rain)
Good aim, though, that red dot up at your Kangol (B-b-baow)
Lookin' in my DM and I see your main ho (Ayy)
You know we the ones that came up with the bando (You know)
Them boys talkin' 'bout the boards on the windows (Bando)
When you trappin', keep a shooter at the front door
Fuck, twelve, runnin' out the back door (Ayy)
The ring on my pinky is bigger than a globe (Woah)
Skippa Da Flippa done flipped a nigga, never fold (Flippa)
Pipin' up in front of your bitch, you get elbowed (Baow)
Ping pong, hit a nigga with the ring on (Ayy)
Yung Rich Nation jeans on, this your theme song (Huh?)
So many pints in my crib, it's a lean home (Lean)
I'm so high, I just need a wall to lean on
Phone home, get so stoned when we gone (Stoned)
Cookie smoke in the ozone, wrist snow cone (Ice)
Mink, it cost five, I leave the coat on (Mink)
Big Tymer, get your roll on (Rollie)
Chop a nigga with the Ric Flair robe on, hold on (Hold on)

All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando (Grah)
We the first ones that came up with the bando (Bando)
Talkin' 'bout you got the Act', but what it goin' for? (Act')
I'm 'bout to start extortin' niggas for that Migo flow (Ayy)
We the ones that really came in with the kickin' doors (Boom)

I been teachin' niggas lingo like I'm a teacher
Mamacita, she lookin' like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked 'em up with the dab, so we goin' up on the feature
All of my bitches, they piped up and conceited

Offset
Semi-automatic out the window of the Caddy (Graow)
I know this shit is tragic, toss your bitch up like a salad (Smash)
Walk up in the mansion, I just made a money pallet (Mansion)
Trappin' out that bando, selling crack up in the alley (Crack)
I send my young niggas, act a fool with the tool (Baow)
Contemplating should I drop a four or drop a deuce?
Heard you a real slick lookin' for a good lick (Lick)
But my niggas ain't goin' for the bullshit (Naw)
I got the stick, nigga, don't trip (Bah)
Niggas run up in your house, they tyin' up your bitch (Grrat)
Boot up that bitch in the morning on grits (Boot)
J's at the bando in the morning, got a fix (J's)
I'm sitting on the pedestal, my diamonds look impeccable (Shine)
Your bitch sucking my dick just like an edible (Ugh)
Make her take a physical like medical (Physical)
Fuckin' bitches overseas like it's America (Ayy)
You niggas don't even know I got some pain in me (Pain in me)
Missin' my grandma, wish she could sing to me (Grandma)
A lot of dirt I did, I got some shame in it (Ah)
When I'm pulling up, I drop the brain on it (Skrrt)
Came in the game with the fashion statement (Hah)
We dropped "Versace," the fame, it came quick ('Sace)
Gotta stay focused, consistent, don't quit (Ayy)
Brick on my wrist and it make me a lick (Damn)
All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando (Grah)
We the first ones that came up with the bando (Bando)
Talkin' 'bout you got the Act', but what it goin' for? (Act')
I'm 'bout to start extortin' niggas for that Migo flow (Ayy)
We the ones that really came in with the kickin' doors (Boom)
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold ('Sace)
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll

All of my niggas, they ready to get you and hit you and split you and never leave no witness to see you
And if you thinkin' 'bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister, that chopper hit you, havin' a seizure (Ayy)
I been teachin' niggas lingo like I'm a teacher
Mamacita, she lookin' like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked 'em up with the dab, so we goin' up on the feature
All of my bitches, they piped up and conceited

Yeah, yeah, Quavo
The way they took a nigga dab, I wanna smack a nigga (Baow)
Knock a nigga's lights out, Uncle Wack a nigga (Wack 100)
These niggas made out of plastic like an action figure (Plastic)
I can't kick it with your bitch, I ain't no Falcon's kicker (Naw)
Young nigga in the hood eating Honey-sicles (Ugh)
I'ma send your ho a text with the purple pickle (Ho)
Nigga, I ain't gotta flex, I'm a real nigga (Naw)
I know niggas in the bando still trappin' nickels (Uh)
Pop a Perc', you think I'm Marshawn eating Skittles (Perky)
Everybody still comparing Migos to the Beatles (Everybody)
Who the fuck you think you scarin' with that lil' nina? (Who?)
Call my niggas and they pulling up like Al-Qeeda (Ayy)
Damn, I mean Al-Qaeda, spray 'em like a firefighter
For fuckin' with the albino, feeling like Mekhi Phifer
Niggas having ghostwriters, stripes like I'm Tony Tiger
Migo gang the three igniters, then they try to doubt us (Ayy)
I know you remember the Titans (Titans)
You know we got that touch like we work for Midas (Midas)
Like my cookie with the purple in it like the Vikings (Woo)
Came from a long road, you the one that saw us hitchhiking (That's you?)
I pour a glass of water 'cause she wanna pop a Vicodin (Water)
I open up the door, she said, "Damn, my mans, you're frightening" (Woah)
Spikes on my shoe, yeah, I'm Christian Loub, Mike-in' it (Spikes)
Where's Quavo? Bitch, I'm in another continent14Embed
