Bitch-ass nigga, yo, it's time to pull the trigga
I might be small, but fuck with bein' bigga
Niggas wanna throw with that bullshit, but step aside
Pull out the four-five, and kill him motherfuckin' dead
Pump his ass with lead
Never fakin' moves, motherfucker, run the jewels
Buck wild, blowin' niggas out the frame
Matter fact, don't call me shorty, kid, you know my name
So next time, you see me, you better duck me
'Cause I don't give a fuck, G
Catch wreck with the TEC, then I'm out like quick sex
Who's next? Bitch-ass nigga

Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass

Kick it when I'm wicked and all smoked out
The little nigga that gets on your nerves so read about
You say your shorty's trauma, what's all the drama?
I shoot 'em up like their last name is Farmer
Shorty got the death wish, I wish to die
But when I try, it just goes by
You couldn't kill me because I can't kill myself
And if I got beef, then I got it for self
And if I catch a body, I catch it for self
To me, murder is good for the health
Little man paranoid, Mr. Schizophrenic
Thirty-five niggas wanna funk, don't panic
Just shoot a head up, or take your beatin' like a man
Or pull a burner if you want a longer lifespan
That's how I see it, if I gotta die, so be it
But maybe one day, my luck'll run out, though
Until then, I couldn't give a fuck, yo
Little shorty one time, I'm goin' all out for mines
'Cause there won't be a next time
So what you wanna do, punk? Back up a little
Gimme some space, I'm hittin' hearts, street sweeper
A little crazed nigga from the streets
Raised in the ghetto, I'm puttin' out heads, yo
I'm open, time to catch wreck, put 'em in check
Snap his neck, grab his loot, then jet
Who's next to be a victim? Easily ripped up
Get ready to run when I ripped 'em
Drop to the floor, feel the wrath of the drug war
Call me a thug who gets buck when I want more
Maniac with a TEC-9
Hit me up now, 'cause there won't be a next time
Nah, you don't want none, bitch-ass nigga
You might also like
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass

Who's that nigga standin' with the jewels?
Throw on my hood, cock back the tool
Just to get a rep, yeah, you're god damn right
Just lick, lick shots 'cause I don't fuck with fights
Back on the ave when five-o arrive
Chalk on the ground where the motherfucker died
Niggas know who did it, but ain't nobody snitchin'
No word of to myself, if they do, I'm flippin' the script
Settin' it off, yo, put 'em in a dope fiend
And cut 'em up like protein
The lord of criminal juvenile crimes committed
Set it some bitch-ass nigga, I'm with it
You couldn't fuck with the skills of the five foot
And all it takes is a set to get your crew shook
The fuck up, kid, your rap styles sucks
I'm bustin' niggas like my first nut
Should I pull the trigga? Huh, no question
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
Bitch-ass nigga
Nah, you don't want none
