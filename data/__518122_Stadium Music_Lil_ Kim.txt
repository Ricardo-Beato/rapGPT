9 ContributorsStadium Music Lyrics
Yo! (It's over!)
I am, I see you!
This feel like stadium music, you feel me?
Yo!

Hashtag CMG, we trending
Worldwide popularity, we getting it
And my goal 100 mill, I'm hitting it
Right now a nigga working with ten, I ain't sleeping
Uh, they went napping on a nigga (true)
Pull up in that Phantom like what's happening on a nigga
I'm selling lifestyle, what else, my Rollie iced out
They say I fucked the watch up, big head bezel
Nigga, I fucked the block up, put rims on a Phantom
Nigga, and fucked the car up, ha
Damn, but it's paid for
Get money, blow it, ain't that what it's made for, uh?
Fucking ask me for some money you a brave hoe, uh
Tricking that ain't in my nature, I don't save hoes, uh
You a C-minus bitch and the streets grade hoes, uh

Blocks to blocks, the hoods to hoods
Blocks to blocks, the hoods to hoods
(Blocks to blocks, the hoods to hoods)
(Gotti, we speak for the hood)
Rags to riches my nigga
Money over bitches my niggas
Feds gon' get you my nigga
But I ain't never snitch on my niggas
You might also like
Hashtag Team Kim, trending
Worldwide, Kim and Gotti keep it pimping (uh)
My niggas got keys like a locksmith
So fly, getting cocked in the cockpit
Haha, and the Herm√®s ostrich
Bad bitch, I'm a top pick
95 South, I used to move it through the traffic
Brooklyn Kim, yeah, the black Kardashian
I'm kind of flashy and I like to floss
These VVS's still dancing when the lights is off
If you a hater, guess you are who you are, player
Ain't even start to ball, this is our layer
I put this money over everything
I do it all for the love of my Royal Reign
I beat the beat up, no boxing ring
World in my hand, ain't drop a thing

Blocks to blocks, the hoods to hoods
Blocks to blocks, the hoods to hoods
(Blocks to blocks, the hoods to hoods)
(Gotti, we speak for the hood)
Rags to riches my nigga
Money over bitches my niggas
Feds gon' get you my nigga
But I ain't never snitch on my niggas1Embed
