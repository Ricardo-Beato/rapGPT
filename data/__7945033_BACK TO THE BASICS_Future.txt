Plenty, cry
This life without you
You don't want, you don't want, you don't want
You don't want, you don't want to go back to the basics, yeah

Checked the velocity, hope you can weather through the storm
Peep out the carpet, it's custom stitched up in yarn
Hottest commodity covered in Italian velour
Hold on to your faith when I need you to be there
Askin' for your heart, if it's real then it's rare
Ocean in the sea, GIA I see
Lunch time in Cheetah with snow bunny divas
Only for me, this just ain't for the relapse
Bubble eye Benz came with goggles, yeah
Gang of Korean, talk to me proper, yeah
Translator friend, European model, yeah
They cover my trend, top story, ESPN
So many chains like a turtleneck under my chin
I'll learn to speak another language if it makes sense
Princess cut clarity VVSs
Military money out the gutter, ducked the popo
Three strips skrrted goin' solo
Havin' the time of my life with no photo
Can't show every gift you get to IG when you fuck on a mogul
I DC sniped it and I hit it listenin' to gogo
I'ma make 'em lose count if they addin' up the total
After I fuck you, let me cry on your shoulder
This is a chance of a lifetime
You might also like
After we make love, let me cry on your shoulder
You don't want, you don't want, you don't want
You don't want to go back to the basics
You don't want, you don't want, you don't want
You don't want, you don't want to go back to the basics
Get a room key, check in saying two-o-four
After we make love, let me cry on your shoulder
You don't want, you don't want, you don't want
You don't want to go back to the basics
You don't want to go back to the basics11Embed
