Why y'all keep on worrying 'bout what Flocka doin'
Need to worry if you got some life insurance
Why y'all keep worryin bout what Gucci doin'
Need to think if y'all got some embalming fluid
Why y'all keep on worrying 'bout what Flocka doin'
Need to worry if you got some life insurance
Why you keep worryin bout what Gucci doin'
Need to worry if you got embalming fluid

Embalming fluid, embalming fluid
Burn yo body up we need some lighter fluid
Lighter fluid, lighter fluid
End of the day you shouldn't of got into it
Got into it, got into it
End of the day we shouldn't have got into it

Broke fifths in my bag bitch
I'mma shoot first ain't asking shit
Before I talk to em bring chalk to em
I'mma blast them put a fork in it
Gun fight you brought a knife in it
You gambling with your life in it
Playing with your wife god damn this is sad business
Good playin' but bad intentions
Talkin' long but the man didn't listen
Shootout for thirty minutes
Were in the kitchen son getting a whole damn kitchen
Gotta life but I might risk it
Still serving these White chicks
Drink white liquor fuck white bitches might pull up in my white Bentley
Why you worried bout Flocka business cuz what he eat ain't makin you shit
Why you worry bout Gucci business like groupie bitches you all on my dick
You might also like
Embalming fluid, embalming fluid
Burn yo body up we need some lighter fluid
Lighter fluid, lighter fluid
End of the day you shouldn't of got into it

Why y'all keep on worrying 'bout what Flocka doin'
Need to worry if you got some life insurance
Why y'all keep worryin bout what Gucci doin'
Need to think if y'all got some embalming fluid
Why y'all keep on worrying 'bout what Flocka doin'
Need to worry if you got some life insurance
Why you keep worryin bout what Gucci doin' (FLOCKA!)
Need to worry if you got embalming fluid

My clip strong no six pack
Bullets rip your muscle push your wig back
Diamonds chains can't snatch that
No talking just click clack
In the VIP where the pills at
Smoking strong that Bill Jack
I'm a real nigga you all rap
You a fuck nigga it ain't safe for ya
My flag red, my dawgs felons
You a fuck nigga yo dawgs talkin
20 bands my dawgs'll off him
Rolling hard off a blue dolphin
Popped a molly, that molly juice
Beat the pussy like I produce
She brought her friend that's an alley oop
With two M's go animal
Animal yeah animal
She fucked Dirty she fucked Scooter
Beat made by Lex Luger
My B-I don't worry bout it
Money don't worry bout it
Bitch I'm already rich
Diamonds in my grill I be talking cash shit
Squad
Why y'all keep on worrying 'bout what Flocka doin'
Need to worry if you got some life insurance
Why y'all keep worryin bout what Gucci doin'
Need to think if y'all got some embalming fluid
Why y'all keep on worrying 'bout what Flocka doin'
Need to worry if you got some life insurance
Why you keep worryin bout what Gucci doin' (FLOCKA!)
Need to worry if you got embalming fluid5Embed
