6 ContributorsParagraphs of Love Lyrics
Her face glowed like I was exposed to sunlight
She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is done right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on the impossible
She blushes, as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous, is all around, she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood, like we changed the channel
This is art, Picasso, I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty, Nefertiti, herring bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step, went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on, parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama, she built like Alicia Keys
No façade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks, writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand, I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes, as I gave her, her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me, are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything, I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sautéed shrimp

Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January, my first, and it's kinda scary
It's only June, and Christmas, I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name

Peace, I'm Gabby, well I gotta go, my husband is waitin'

But before I go, can I give you one last statement
You the most beautifullest queen, I ever seen
And I would love to have a thing like you, on my team, you take care

Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
Cuz I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
Cuz this was love at first sight
Cuz this was love at first sight
It's OK

You can tell he must be on a mission
Because my heart has made it's decision
As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision
I fell in love, sweet love
And no infatuated 3D glasses to see
That your the one I need
And the situation don't matter to me
Cuz this is love, it gotta be love
Love at first sight
Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
Cuz I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
Cuz this was love at first sight
Cuz this was love at first sight
It's OK
Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
Cuz I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
Cuz this was love at first sight
Cuz this was love at first sight
It's OK1Embed
