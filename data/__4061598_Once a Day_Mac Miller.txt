Once a day, I rise
Once a day, I fall asleep with you
Once a day, I try but I can't find a single word
I wonder what they know
I wonder if they ever even cared at all
I wonder, do they see their own reflection in the rain
And look away?

Everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby, I get high

Don't ask me what I think
It never really mattered what I had to say
I just keep waiting for another open door
To come up soon
Don't keep it all in your head
The only place that you know nobody ever can see
You're running low on regret
No tears, that's keeping you wet
I think you gettin' it now

But everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby, I get high
You might also like
And everybody means something
When they're stuck on your mind
But every now and again, why can't we just be fine?

Once a day, I rise
Once a day, I fall asleep with you
Once a day, I try but I can't find a single word23Embed
