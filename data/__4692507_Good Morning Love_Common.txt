13 ContributorsGood Morning Love Lyrics
Yeah

When we wash all our pain away
We say, "Oh, my Lord"
When we can't make it through the day
We pray, oh, my Lord
It's a test coming to my faith
We pray, oh, my Lord, mmh
Will my people ever be safe?
In the land that takes us and breaks us, I can't be sure

Walking with the Lord, I see footprints
My mama always told me use my good sense
Common always looking for the good sense
Since we all got good in our essence
In the hood sense, we all good anyway
That's why you always hear another dollar, 'nother day
I see the day as a new beginning
Movement of the people, movement of the women
To get the Earth spinning in the right direct
This movie of life, sometimes might project
Acts, scenes that don't seem serene
I light palo santo, put on Love Supreme
And get into the being of the great I am
That's when I get to seeing just how great I am
Many many times from mistakes, I ran
But I'm just a cake, let me bake, goddamn
I pray I don't forsake my man
And whenever I fall, on faith, I land
Imperfections, resurrections
In the mirror staring at God's reflection
Reflecting on my aggressions
On my progressions, on my obsessions
There's a lesson in not feeling less
And in seeing life itself as a blessing
You might also like
When we wash all our pain away
We say, "Oh, my Lord"
When we can't make it through the day
We pray, oh, my Lord
It's a test coming to my faith
We pray, oh, my Lord, mmh
Will my people ever be safe?
In the land that takes us and breaks us, I can't be sure

Yeah
The jubilee of a newer me
Giving my enemies something new to see
My community, they be fueling me
In the struggle of us, there's a unity
The moral universe stay schooling me
Will the king of kings really rule in me?
I'm an instrument, stay in tune with me
This orchestrated by Karriem, Samora, Boom, and me
If agape had a Cupid, she'd be shooting me
This rap here is fear's eulogy
Escape rooms with glasses of wine
Just another crutch for my brokenness
A term that I got from my therapist
As a black man, I feel I should be sharin' this
In the hood they say we crazy and we derelicts
But we needed for our kids and our marriages
The old folks say we don't do that
But taking care of self is the new black
Unconventional ways, unconditional ways
Mediation, mindfulness, it's just given to praise
I'm in a phase, all I see is victory
You on that wave, then come and get with me
I only want what's meant for me
And say the things that's sent to me
In penitentiaries, I met the most enlightened
Finding the losses, Heaven's excitement
I write with a force of a kid that wanted to
Be in The Source, but that changed, of course
I maintained the sauce and became a boss
I apologize if I came across
As judgmental, or self-righteous
'Cause in you, I see his likeness
When we wash all our pain away
We say, "Oh, my Lord"
When we can't make it through the day
We pray, oh, my Lord
It's a test coming to my faith
We pray, oh, my Lord, mmh
Will my people ever be safe?
In the land that takes us and breaks us, I can't be sure1Embed
