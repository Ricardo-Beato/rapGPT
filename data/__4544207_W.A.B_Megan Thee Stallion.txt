When I say weak ass, you say bitch (Ayy)
Weak ass, bitch (Ayy)
Weak ass, bitch (Ayy, yeah)
When I say weak ass, you say bitch (Huh)
Weak ass, bitch

When I, when I say weak ass, you say bitch

Weak ass, bitch

Weak ass, bitch

Fuck you and your weak ass, weak ass friends (Huh)

Tough in the comments, but in person you a joke (Ayy, huh)
Promise this ain't what you want
Run through your shit like a comb
All that rah-rah, talkin' loud
Need to watch your fuckin' tone
Man, you finna piss me off (Ayy, ayy)
If you 'bout it, bring 'em out (Bring 'em out)
You ain't never gon' address me

Don't run when you see me (Come here)
Talkin' 'bout what you would do

Watch your mouth before I ho ya

Bitch I'm 'bout it, but you knew that (Ayy)
I don't need the crowd
Pull up one deep right wherever you at (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
Bitches hate me 'cause I'm sexy
Buyin' shit that I was blessed with
I can't argue with no ho about a nigga I be dissin'
You need to relax, sis
'Fore you get spanked like a bad kid
I do not know who is gassin' you up (Ayy, ayy)
But I'll knock the key out your back, bitch (Back, bitch)
I wanna see what you really about
I wanna to see if you really get down (Yeah)
Know that you goofy the way that you talkin' (Ayy, ayy)
But I wanna see if you really a clown
Talking shit about me, mhmm
When you see me, ain't gon' do nothin'
Got connections out in Texas
Make my niggas come and shoot somethin' (Ayy, ayy, bow-bow-bow)
Keep it cool but I'm dramatic (Hey, hey)
Rub me wrong and get this static
Bitches stackin' like they 'bow
But if they see me, they gon' panic
Huh!
When I say weak ass, you say bitch (Ol' weak ass hoes)
Weak ass, bitch
Weak ass, bitch (Huh)
When I say weak ass, you say bitch (Yeah)
Weak ass, bitch (Yeah, yeah)
Weak ass, bitch (Yeah, ayy)

Weak ass, bitch (Bow, bow)
Weak ass, bitch (Ol' weak ass hoes)
When I say weak ass, you say bitch
Weak ass, bitch
Weak ass, bitch (Yeah, huh)
