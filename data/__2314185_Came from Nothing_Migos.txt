19 ContributorsCame from Nothing Lyrics
Ay
Mi-Migo
Do it for all my young niggas, for real
(Dun Deal on the track)

Young niggas came from nothing (nun)
Young niggas came from nothing (nun)
Young niggas came from nothing (nun)

Young niggas came from nothing (nun)
Young nigga came from nothing
So, I'ma get money forever

So, I'ma get money forever

I'ma get money forever

Quavo!
I'ma get money forever
Young nigga, I was rebellious
My momma told me they was jealous, forreal (Momma, damn)
I had to kick me a door (Boom)
I was trapping on the Nawf (Northside)
Now it's 40 thousand for a show, forreal
Takeoff just bought the whole seal (That's Raheem, lean)
Play with the water like I'm Navy Seal (Splash, water, ooh)
I'm having choppers on my nigga, fuck how you feel (brrr, brrr)
Bout it, bout it, like I'm No Limit having independent deal (QC)
My plug coming in on a boat (Eduardo)
I swear to god that's the realest shit a nigga never wrote
Take your hoe, take her shopping, buy her coats
Get her Chanel so she won't never tell
16, when I dropped off the porch
18, I was juugin' the bales
I'm from the Nawf (Nawf), throw up your hood
For my niggas, we lost (lost)
Pour up a pint of the mud (drank)
I know to keep it 100 (hundo)
My niggas keep it 100 (hundo)
We all about making some money (money)
'Cause my niggas came from nothing

So, I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever

So, I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever

Takeoff
I'ma get money forever, my niggas they clever
However my niggas get cheddar (Checks)
I know some niggas that whippin' Cinderella, wrist spinnin' like a propeller (whip, whip)
Black and white Margielas like a Goodfella
Sold out arenas, performing at Coachella
Niggas don't know better, so don't do better but if you knew better, then you would do better
Young nigga play with that rock like Carmelo, Anthony
Big booty bitches like J-Lo, Lopez
That ain't codeine, boy that's Karo
I'm getting Milwaukee Bucks, O.J. Mayo
They want the Migos to go solo (uh uh)
They don't know that that is a no-go
I get that gadget go go
It's outta here like Albert Pujols
Roll up a backwood, kickin' shit like judo
Balling on niggas like JUCO
Taking niggas chain like Deebo (gimme dat)
Woop 'em, now we call 'em Rico
I'm still sippin' Act, but keep that on the d-low (Actavis)
'Cause nowadays pint like a brick of gold
I know some niggas that you snatch out your soul
Nigga come and wipe yo nose (watch it fall)
Young nigga get to the money, my nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Got rich off of snow bunny trapping and capping them onions (Lil' nigga, lil' nigga)
Fuck the mansion, go back to the bando, we don't want no company nigga (no company nigga)
No more interviews, no more discussions, I'm closing door on these niggas
I dont even wanna talk to these niggas
Young niggas came from nothing (nun)
Young niggas came from nothing (nun)
Young niggas came from nothing (nun)
Young niggas came from nothing (nun)
Young niggas came from nothing (nun)
Young niggas came from nothing (nun)
Young nigga came from nothing
So, I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever
So, I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever
I'ma get money forever2Embed
