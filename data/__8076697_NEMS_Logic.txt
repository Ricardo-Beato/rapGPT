Yo Logic man, this is NEMS
Lemme tell you something about yourself real quick
Don't ever disrespect me lookin' like "Squints" from the Sandlots, you heard?
Don't ever disrespect me with them bifocals on bro, tryna' rap
You can't even see your raps if you wrote them down
You heard? With them shits
Listen, don't ever disrespect me with that hairline, bro
That shit is in—, that shit is triggerin', bro
That shit gets me angry, man
Don't ever disrespect me with half-curly, half-straight hair, bro
What type of shit is that?
Don't еver disrespect mе lookin' like a black and white cookie, matter of fact, yo
Don't ever disrespect me lookin' like an inside-out Oreo, bro
Don't ever disrespect me calling yourself "Young Sinatra", bro
You ain't even got that type of swag, bro
Stop frontin' for the people
You know the vibes, man
Fuck your life, bing bongYou might also likeEmbed
