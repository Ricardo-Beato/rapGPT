6 ContributorsTalking in Codes Lyrics

{"Alright, are you ready?"}
Fuck that

These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him in a hoopty, squeeze, hit him through the do'
These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him on the front porch by his momma do'
These niggas is green

It's nothing to it, cock it, bang it and get rid of that
Hit his fitted cap, he won't get a chance to Twitter that
I make the Ruger sing a song, bullets hum to you
You better have God with you when I come to you
I'm a grimy nigga, I said some simple shit
You's a dirty nigga with syphilis on your dick
I catch you I'mma wash you up, line you, spit-shine you
Leave you right there in the street where niggas can find you
Die, nigga, die, fly, pelican, fly
When I pull it eat a bullet, don't question me why
That's the laws of the jungle, I'll show you what the gun do
My bad, what the shell do, you rot until they smell you
You might also like
These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him in a hoopty, squeeze, hit him through the do'
These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him on the front porch by his momma do'
These niggas is green

Get green, son, get him, cut his head
He didn't even see it coming, he sleeping, that's what he did
Get biz, niggas acting like it ain't what it is
Let the knife work push the blade up in his shit
Let Doc come sew him up, gang signs throw 'em up
In my hood growing up you pussy or you 'bout it
You shooting or you running, the police coming
Niggas get at you you get at them or you don't mean nothing
Niggas walk tough, even walk like warriors
On some G shit, they get to singing like Gloria
Now come clean, tell us what you told the D's
Matter fact don't tell us shit, motherfucker, hold these

These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him in a hoopty, squeeze, hit him through the do'
These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him on the front porch by his momma do'
These niggas is green
Yeah, feels like summer to me
Expect it nice and hot
40 day, my bad, my bad
Family day, I be in the projects
Y'all come check me out
Get a chance to do some new shit
You don't wanna miss this, trust me

These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him in a hoopty, squeeze, hit him through the do'
These niggas is green, these niggas is green
I'm talking in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him on the front porch by his momma do'
These niggas is greenEmbed
