11 ContributorsTheyâ€™re All Gonna Laugh @ You Lyrics
You'd better find a way, you'd better do it soon
It's like the middle of May and you've only got 'til June
And if I'm forced to watch you touch that torch to that spoon
Even one more time, I swear to God I'm gonna implode
Sky's too high to hold; too thick to pet
So fold up your two-bits and hide 'em in your wallet
In your pocket full of trauma, in love notes you wrote to the angels
Gathered around the pole, crude and star-strangled
The banter; married in the bed made from propaganda
I've roamed the avenues of humility
And I've kept a toothbrush in the glove compartment
Next to the napkins
For when I'm finally privileged and touched with a permanent address
And I'll be relaxed after this gin and tonic
And I'll bless your track after the impact of a comet
And I'll pay the mortgage after I'm finished paying homage
I promise, consider it accomplished!
For every cigarette butt that's tryin' to climb out of my ashtray
Signifies another phase in this cascade
The great mind, great migraine
We think it's difficult enough to just live, much less gain
Well I put my two bucks on the table just like the sign says
Proceeded to ask God to give me one good reason why we shouldn't perish
She says as careless as we are, unstable as we seem
"Selected few of y'all have found something to cherish."
I countered that, maybe just to be argumentative, I don't know
But I was like "Yo, can't we spare the ones that are worth it?"
She's like "No. I need the comparisons."
I think she could tell by the way I'm responding that I'm getting a little nervous
So I went far left and just said thank you
Thank you for the time, for the mind
For the breath, for the flesh
Thank you for the quest, thank you for the vision
This vision that spawns anxiety trying to see and feel why I'm living
Time is money, every moment is costly
So I ration emotion because existence exhausts me
Oddly enough, I'm happy I ain't famous
Imagine waking up to the fact that you're simply entertainment
I bet god thinks you're amusingYou might also likeEmbed
