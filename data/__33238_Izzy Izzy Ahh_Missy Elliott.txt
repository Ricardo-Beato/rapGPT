Timbaland, uh-uh

Saint Nick, uh-huh
Timbaland, uh-huh

I pulls up in my stretch (Stretch)
I let my homegirls flex my '98
Close and closer, they follow in my limo, playin' CDs
Of when I used to hee-hee totally in my ass cheeks
They sweat these beats for any kinda jeeps
You know how I is
So freakin' hot that I siz'
Gee whiz, get my clothes tailored like I'm Liz Miz
I'm comin' for your ass in a min, seconds or hours
Everything I do seem to bloom like flowers
I cruise these beats like I'm drivin' Eddie Bauer (Beep beep)
Some of y'all MCs mad I got the power
I hit you with brrp, take that
Niggas wanna scat when I, uh, take that
What? Mm, take that
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh
