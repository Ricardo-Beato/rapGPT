We have to stop wars, we have to stop this war
And we have to get out the habit of war
It's more than a habit, it's an addiction
We have to get out of thinking that we must be a military superpower
We must get out of thinking that we must have military bases, as we have in a hundred countries
Is it possible that having military bases in a hundred countries arouses a lot of antagonism?
Is it possible that it promotes terrorism when your soldiers and your sailors are all over the world, occupying this country and that? Is it possible?
Why do we have to be a military superpower?
Why can't we be a humanitarian superpower?
Instead of sending planes for bombs
Why don't we send planes for food and medicine?
Oh shit, it's one of the machines
Looks like it's trapped under something, it's broken or something

Let's get out here -- we cannot stay

Hold on lemme get my keyboard, I can re-program this thing

It doesn't matter. Leave it!
No seriously, I can do it -- just give me a second!
Reprogramming unsuccessful

Enemy -- I kill people
I swear to God, man, I can do this! I can do this!
Cross your fingers
You have to work!
All right, this is the last time
Reprogramming successful

Yes!
