Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
Ayy

Ayy, pistol in my coupe, can't fit in my shoe, ayy
Money in the garage, can't fit in my room, ayy
Ten hoes in my bed, can't fit in my pool, ayy
Niggas in my crib, can't fit in my zoo, ayy
You ain't shooting pistols, I can't rock with you, ayy
Money on my mental, I can't talk to you, ayy
I'm Glo Gang, I can't talk for you, ayy
I'm my own man, I can't walk for you, ayy

Metro Boomin want some more, nigga, ayy
Lot of choppers for this war, nigga, ayy
Lot of vans for the drive-by, nigga
Make my gun sing a song, you'll get chorus, nigga, ayy
Eight shots comin' for you, nigga, ayy
Don't stand here, move forward, nigga, ayy
Some of my guns just got deported, nigga
But I know he gon' get it
Like a phone, we forward pictures
Told the police, "Don't make me call my lawer, nigga"
I told homie, "Don't make me drop my .40, nigga," ayy
I'm Glo'd up, up, bitch I'm in my Glory, nigga
And if you see me, you know I ain't worried, nigga
You might also like
Ayy, pistol in my coupe, can't fit in my shoe, ayy
Money in the garage, can't fit in my room, ayy
Ten hoes in my bed, can't fit in my pool, ayy
Niggas in my crib, can't fit in my zoo, ayy
You ain't shooting pistols, I can't rock with you, ayy
Money on my mental, I can't talk to you, ayy
I'm Glo Gang, I can't talk for you, ayy
I'm my own man, I can't walk for you, ayy1Embed
