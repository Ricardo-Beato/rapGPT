It's your favorite neighborhood rap nigga
Or Rapman
Shit feel like I'm Superman sometimes
Or Superfly
I can't choose, yeah

I grew up around weed smoke, just like the Marleys
Heard my Mom whenever she spoke, they havin' parties
This the 70's, of course Donna Summer's voice
Me, I'm in some holey but clean undershorts on the bed tryin' somersaults
And when summer starts, you hear a hundred shots
Steppin' over empty liquor bottles I come across
Scented stickers that smell like what's in the picture
Was just a kid but I stayed away from the sniffers
We knew better, we knew how to see a setup
Just wanted to be some players pull up in a Jetta
From the Census Bureau they put up a killer's mural
It's a different world with thirty shot clips that curl, melon popped
Like John Fitzgerald with his girl in a drop
If he can get hit, then anybody can get got
And you a easy target, see you never know who watchin'
Cold hearted monsters, whole city going bonkers

Ain't nobody recession proof (Recession proof)
Invest in you, that's what it's best to do (Best to do)
Consuming poison, somebody bless the food (Food)
Who you tryna impress? What's there left to prove? (Left to prove)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Can't be out here movin' sloppy
Movie lobby, they shot him out of his two Huaraches
I'm on a yacht, old smash with a newer body
New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me
New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me
New makes, new models
You might also like
I'm guessin' it's a blessin' I'm not just lucky (Nah)
They say son hate the spotlight when they discuss me
On a filthy night my man was serving a custie
Under my mom's window wanted to murder this dummy
If she caught us down here rakin' this dirty money
It'll be ugly
She flushed it before, now she feel like she can't trust me
'Cause Jung hid his jumb's in the building
And I peeped him, I was low so I stole 'em and sold 'em while he was sleepin'
Re-up, gave it back with interest, we even
Some of these things that we escape, I can't believe it
Knicks game up in the seats, I barely hit the floor
Not tryna sit across from somebody lady I hit before
Top of fourth quarter, I skate, hit the liquor store
Lambo Aventador, Maybach with a minibar
Met a girl from Senegal, told her 'bout Medgar Evers
While combin' through Louis sweaters, we spinnin' and savin' letters, G's and M's

Ain't nobody recession proof (Nah)
Invest in you, that's what it's best to do (Yeah, best to do)
Consuming poison, somebody bless the food (Who?)
Who you tryna impress? What's there left to prove? (Left to prove)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Can't be out here movin' sloppy
Movie lobby they shot him out of his two Huaraches (Wow)
I'm on a yacht, old smash with a newer body (True)
New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me (Stay on the road in something new)
New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me (Wheels just hit the ground like I'm out)
New makes, new models (That fresh smell)
New makes, new models I won't let 'em stop me (That brand new interior feel)
New makes, new models1Embed
