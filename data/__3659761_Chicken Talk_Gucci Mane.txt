Burn One, Burn One
Chyeah, uh-huh
Zaytoven on the track, dawg
Gucci Mane La Flare
Exclusive, chicken talk

I'm like a rooster in a cartoon, I say I need a brick or two
Half an onion worth of extra, ask me who I gave it to
Raw basin' Willy let him vacuum up the Bentley Coupe
Light Air Ones, buy a brick, I just might front you two
Told her three to let me pay for them there's plenty more to move
Ten thousand dollars worth of 20s in my tennis shoe
Patriotic painted Bentley shorty, its red, white, and blue
Heavy cocaina shorty cake and the icy too
Quarter chicken, half a chicken, man it's like a slice or two
Half a pigeon, whole pigeon, man, that's like a pie or two
Never buy nothing from a nigga 'til he let you drop a deuce
Bentley Coupe on 22s, a hundred more and keep the roof

I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zay give a mic check
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zaytiggy on mic check
You might also like
Gucci throwin' bricks like he using the backboard
Shorty wanted deuces so I charged 'em a stack for it
Got it by the bag, get a whole or a half for it
Sold ya, settle still, 'cause I give for they ask for it
Imported cocaine but I don't have a passport
Offset rims got me looking Dale Earnhardt
Blue and yellow Jacobs, same color my paint job
Always tote guaps 'cause I don't got a black card
The 6 is like the Carter and Gucci's the landlord
But junkies don't get shit unless the J pay for it
Shorty got an ass on her, so I paid for it
I'm ready to leave, but you know I'ma stay for it
Purple golden kush, always call 'em the Laker sacks
Blue and yellow color dro, call it the Pacers pack
Green and white mid, man, I call that the Celtics thrax
You say you the weed man but, bitch, where your bales at?

I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zay give a mic check
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zaytiggy on mic check
Got a Bart Simpson charm so they can eat my shorts
Next piece I'ma cop is the iced out fork
Cristal bottle way to pop my cork
I'm a Dirty South nigga, mama I eat pork
I put it on the saucer if lil' mama like to snort it
Gucci makes it rain whether weatherman report it
Ordered her a daiquiri, heavy on the liquids
Say she like seafood so I got her swordfish
Lobster tail and crab legs since she's on the bed bitch
Can I call you Dorothy? 'Cause you so far from Kansas
Handsome debonair, fellow got the mellow yellow bezel
Black rims on the Phantom, same color Dr. Pepper

I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zay give a mic check
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zaytiggy on mic checkEmbed
