9 ContributorsGymnast Lyrics
Made a promise to my self that I'll be never broke
Counting up all this money but I'm never tired
Three in the morning and I'm still going
Jewelry so cold feel like the wind blowing
Pushing more weight then Arnold Schwarzenegger
Walk-in closet filled with belts and glasses (Gucci!)
Kill ya self my nigga do the world a favor
And I done lost count I got so many haters
Canary watch I swear got yellow fever
Jimmy Choo glasses so its hard to see ya
Put my money on a treadmill, And let it build
Limo tinted SUV I see ya when I see ya
 x2
I'mma gymnast, I'mma gymnast
I'm in the kitchen flippin' chickens I'mma gymnast
I'm in the laboratory now doing chemistry
I can't lie me and Money got a chemistry (Gucci)

Throw the money in the air like I'm Elway, 50 bells at the house, I'mma balesmen, I got 65 thangs on the Expressway
A couple boxes of mid is what they mail me
I love my plug homie shout out to my es√©
I got that gas pack homie you a schwag seller,
I'm in my big dooley Truck, It's a glass house
I'll turn ya sister condo into a trap house
I'm hand to hand with the cookies like a girl scout
Winter time you might catch me in the stretch furr
All black Maybach with the chauffeur
I'mma cooker but yo daddy is a smoker
You might also like x2
I'mma gymnast, I'mma gymnast
I'm in the kitchen flippin' chickens I'mma gymnast
I'm in the laboratory now doing chemistry
I can't lie me and Money got a chemistry (Gucci)

Dirty money throw that money in the shower
She can't even feel her face cause of the powderOne spot three kitchens is a blow spot
Charge you twenty grand flat for some convo
Keep the j's mile high like the Broncos
Got a nigga bussin' bales in the living room
Left ounce n half on the hard wood
Count a half a million cash in the bedroom
Never let a nigga know were yo stash at
Made 75k playing blackjack
Let a nigga get it back playing Cee-Lo
I'm on my old school shit playing kilo
 x2
I'mma gymnast, I'mma gymnast
I'm in the kitchen flippin' chickens I'mma gymnast
I'm in the laboratory now doing chemistry
I can't lie me and Money got a chemistry (Gucci)Embed
