4 ContributorsD Skiâ€™s Intro LyricsM3
Hey, what's up?
My name is Duval
I'm 12 years old
This is my crib
260 Stone Ave, apartment 7B
I live here with my grandmother Effy
She's sleep in the back bedroom
My uncles Marvin and Laury
They share the small bedroom
And my moms Yvonne
We sleep on the fold out couch in the living room
Around here, I be using the DJ D and D Ski
But I've been getting more into rhyming lately
I think I'm starting using the name Ace
Yeah, I like how that sounds
My mom's got a nice little record collection too
I be checking them out when she ain't home
She got some nice grooves I can practice my raps to
You wanna check out her collection?
Alright, but you gotta be real quiet
Come on, shhhYou might also likeEmbed
