Yeah
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
I'm like...

This-this-this-this-this the type of shit they said they really wanted
So I gave them this right here, now go get blunted
Check my last album, all y'all know I run it
Flipped the script just 'cause I could and fucking stunted
This-this-this-this-this the type of shit my life is all about
Check the Forbes list, you know I'm ballin' out
They say, "Logic, you too humble, boy, just let it out"
Fuck 'em all then, I'ma dead it now
Like oh, I think I know, I think I know
This flow, this super flow, out of control
Like woah, this shit like woah, I think I know
Like woah, like, like woah, like, like, like...

This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted from the young boy
From the—from the—from the god
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted from the rap god
From the—from the—from the god

I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
I'm like...

Hold on, let me bring it back
Everybody know I'm bringing the facts
And they wonder why I got it like that
'Cause I put everything right on the track
And you know I'ma fuck around and let it go
I been living like woah, I been living, you already know
And these motherfuckers wanna take up on every mistake
And I'm showing where I'm going
And I'm knowing what I'm doing, intuition never switching
On a mission, motherfucker, why is you bitching? Why is you bitching?
Like God damn, I'm like (Oh God)
Hold up, wait a minute, they ain't ready for the hook
It's another day, another book
I feel like Indiana in Atlanta, hotter than Havana
Coming with the stamina
Bitch, put down your camera, and live in the moment
This shit right here, everybody gon' want it, so what up wit’ it?
Any and everybody talk about the boy changing
Y'all can just shut up wit’ it 'cause I know
Ain't none of y'all getting the flow, boy...
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted from the young boy
From the—from the—from the god
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted from the rap god
From the—from the—from the god

I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
Yeah, I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it...

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It's been a hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)
Hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
That I've been M.I.A, but I was tied up
Till I heard you talking shit, now I'm fired up
