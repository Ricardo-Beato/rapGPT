5 ContributorsMy Kitchen (80 Gz) Lyrics
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? Plenty working in the kitchen

Thirty thousand dollars for the So Icey Squad
Thousand pound deal for the So Icey Boys
Gucci Aquarius a So Icy shark
Selling white chalk tryna duck these narcs
Bought some Lowenharts and some D.U.B.'s
34 inch Ashanti's on the Humvee
Whole lot of purp, whole lot of green
Whole heap of white, large amount of beans
Got them collard greens, sell a lot of things
Four plus a four, dawg, that's a chicken wing
Trapping in a drought, money in the vault
Bring me another pot and another fork
