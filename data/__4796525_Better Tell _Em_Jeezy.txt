I made fifty of them thangs to put the hood on the map (Yeah)
Big old shootout yesterday, it put the heat on the trap (Damn)
Gotta do it with 'em, baby, got the pot and the cap (Pot and the cap)
My auntie mother ain't trippin' 'cause she takin' a nap (Yeah)
Hope rhyme beat the feds, I just might make it in rap (Make it in rap)
Right now a package on the road, I pray it makin' it back (Makin' it back)
It just pulled in the garage as a matter of fact (Yeah)
Ten minutes later I was cookin' some crack
