(This is a Dolan Beats production)
T'd
Can you hear me now? (Ayy)
T'd (Ayy)
Coolin' on the block (Ayy, weed)
Good, coolin' on the block (Ayy, ayy)
Coolin' on the block (Ayy, ayy)

Coolin' up on that Glo block, with them things cocked, smokin' on green crop (Ayy)
Let a nigga pull up on the block, try approach we and he gon' be dropped (Ayy)
Pistols be like that beat drop, (Ayy) drive by, he thought he wouldn't (Ayy)
Give his ass the hiccups, shootin' out my Jeep truck (Bang)
Bitch, the life of the party, we are (Gang)
The death of the party, we caused (Glo Gang)
That nigga act deaf in the party, his heat tucked (Bang)
We gon' turn this bitch into the Glo Gang Arena (Glo Gang, bang, bang)

I'm coolin' on the Glo Gang block (Bang, ayy)
I'm totin' the Glo Gang Glock (Bang)
Don't make Glo Gang pop (Bang, ayy)
Make you crash your car (Bang, ayy)
I'm smokin' on this gas, hittin' hard (Bang)
They like, "Damn, your diamonds hard"
Now I can't drive fancy cars (Bang)
'Member when I used to be grindin' hard (Damn)
But I'm still in the studio, still got my toolie, though
Still let it bang at your kufi, though, you a lil' goofy, though (Ayy)
You ain't gotta beef with me, you ain't competin' with me
You ain't my cup of tea, nigga, you can' eat with me (Ayy, ayy-ayy)
My niggas' hot sauce (Ayy)
They ain't got no problem with knockin' your top off (Bang, ayy)
You a real nigga knockoff (Ayy, ayy)
That just wanna be Almighty So (Ayy, you can't)
(Almighty So, Almighty So, Almighty So, Almighty So)
(Almighty So, Almighty So, Almighty So, Almighty So)
