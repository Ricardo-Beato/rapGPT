18 ContributorsSB 2021 Lyrics
Yeah
Uh
Yeah, yeah
Uh
(Who the hell is Carlo?)
Yeah

This is Sada and this Scuba Boat, they call us the GOAT
Sippin' tris this my last resort, just like Papa Roach
Chanel jacket for my bitch, on the side Chanel brooch
I ain’t gon' lie rather get to walkin' before I fly in coach (Yeah)
Niggas turn demons when this shit start gettin' slow
Woke up started leanin', I can’t even feel my toes
My lil' brother steady fiendin', I'm just happy it ain't coke (Damn)
If it was I'll prolly punch him in his nose
Man, I can’t believe what these niggas be doin'
For hoes
First nigga I callеd and hit the D
Was Scuba Steve
I lovе my bitch pussy cause it’s tighter than Iverson sleeve
Bitch get on my nerve give me a headache, give me some Aleve
Fuck that
Thank God my opps got some money (Finally)
I was tired of beefin’ with them niggas, they was not on nothin’
You might also like
Ayy
Niggas ain’t never gon’ be on shit
Had the ski-mask on the keyboard, act like I’m Gent
Had the ski-mask on yo' lil' ho, everytime I went
Had the ski-mask, nigga, ah
Rack 'em up everytime I pull up (Yeah)
My godson grown as hell, don’t wear no pull-ups (Yeah)
Ride around with  just to shoot yo' hood up (Yeah)
The only reason I know you over there cause y’all don’t do nun (Yeah)
Y'all don't never leave, niggas don’t never eat
I go through there eatin', AK yo pooper eatin'
I get extra cheese, whippin' up all that Medellín
She gon' have sex with me, everytime you let her leave
Put the purse up on em, show em how that weather be (Yeah)
It be extra heat, nigga better not mess with me (Yeah)
Only be with gang, don’t like nobody where I'm from
Ain’t got no friends in my bity, bitch quit actin' dumb, huh
Be with my brothers not no others, I ain’t got no love, huh
We do numbers every summer, that's why we got guns
I'm 'bout to make a ton
Serve that rocky cold, Tum-Tum
I can't hit the trap unless I'm 'bout to get a lump sum
Brazilian bitch gon' eat the dick like feijoada
Huh, I'ma pop a Perc' so she can get the best Sada
Freaky bitch gon' eat the dick like cassava
Look her in her eye, like bitch don’t call me Casada
Swing that bitch like Oosthuizen, if you playin’ with my guala
Pull up in some Prada, smoke a nigga like some grabba
Go cucaracha on yo' momma, I could sauce about them dollas
Shoot a nigga if he holla, give a fuck about no problems
When Lil Yachty pulled up in Detroit
They asked me where the choppa was
You know I
Would give it to him if he ain't have no drums
Ain't nobody solidare, bitch we solitaires
I'm in Detroit, on my face it's some Cartiers
Makin' Ms writin' for these bitches, like I’m Tyler Perry
Praying to my Jesus piece, like I’m Bloody Mary
I (Uh, uh, uh)
My way in her pussy
These niggas too sensitive 'round me, I think these niggas pussy
I rolled up, on a nigga bitch like my name was Tootsie
Might could blow you up, but I need a chunk just like a chocolate cookie
I really am that nigga
I really pull up seven figures, that's one call and they flip niggas
It’s us
Gotta flex everyday, I don't wanna rust, uh
Big shit, sit up in my garage collectin' dust
Respect for being on my jewelry, if I must say
You ain’t suckin' dick, so you better go catch that bus babe
My earrings could protect the whole ice age

PussyEmbed
