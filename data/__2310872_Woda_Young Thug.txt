13 ContributorsWoda Lyrics
I'll fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie
Them niggas that behind me, they tote gats wodie
And them niggas that's behind me ain't the last wodie, wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas? Burn up
Got cash? Throw up, wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas? Burn up
Got cash? Throw up, up

Been a hot boy, 5-0-4
But I'm little Haiti's B-E-O
Bitch tried to fuck me first, no N-O
I need super dome first, no N-O
No kinfolk, cause I fuck her 'til she turtle like Lorenzo
I don't play no games, not 'tendo
Niggas couldn't be me with a thugger scope
But on another note
I would like to marry your wife
But I wouldn't like to pay the price, that's why I think twice
Nah, I think nice
So if you think once, I'll think thrice
You heard me?
You might also like
I'll fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie
Them niggas that behind me, they tote gats wodie
And them niggas that's behind me ain't the last wodie, wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas? Burn up
Got cash? Throw up, wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas? Burn up
Got cash? Throw up, up

Pullin' up on Bleveland, might ruin your evenin'
We street like the cement, even during 
Nat Nat bring it back, where you at, Old Nat?
These haters still up with it, give him cooties you stuck with it
Boss the iced out pieces, gave me so I could bust with 'em
I only perform for cheese, my flyest go to Pizza Hut with 'em
I still eat at Mickey D's, cause they got sluts in 'em
Nigga I caught your bitch on the street, she got a little mutt in her
And I'm gonna marry your wife
Just to make you think twice, and you won't look nice
You's a mean faced bastard
But how you gon' rush Casper?
I'll fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie
Them niggas that behind me, they tote gats wodie
And them niggas that's behind me ain't the last wodie, wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas? Burn up
Got cash? Throw up, wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas? Burn up
Got cash? Throw up, up1Embed
