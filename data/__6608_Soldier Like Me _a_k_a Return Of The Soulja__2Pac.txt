So what I'm gonna do, hopefully, is
I wanna be— (A straight soldier)
I'm—, I—, I—, not I wanna be, I am Tupac Shakur
Tupac 2005
Guess who's back
G—Guess who's back
G—G—Guess who's back
G—G—G—Guess who's back,
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier

Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police, as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so low you'd think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef, I'm robbin' niggas of they teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play toughy
Last time them niggas rushed me
I ain't bust, but now I'm touchy, trust me
Ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buckshots
A nigga's got enough knocks, I'm poppin' at corrupt cops
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem
Now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfuckin' soldier, ready to roll and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin', 'cause there's no stoppin' till they rubbed out
And they vests don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryna keep a nigga down, but shit fails
Before I let you take me, I told you
Fuck bein' trapped, I'm a soldier
You might also like
I bet you that I got something you ain't got
(Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier)
That's called courage
(Everywhere I see, a soldier like me)
It don't come from no liquor bottle
(Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier)
It ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon
(Everywhere I see, a soldier like me)
I don't walk around like no G
(Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier)
‘Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
(Everywhere I see, a soldier like me)
I don't try to act like you do
(Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier)
‘Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't?
(Everywhere I see, a soldier like me)

Huh, it's Tupac and the mad bitch
In the six-four rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghost on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the back seat, nigga, when we clown
Homie, is you down? Dee got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up 'fore she spank shit
Comin' round the corner spittin' rounds, they can't hold me down
Caught them sucker-ass bitches outta bounds
Now tell me how that sound? A double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the Judgement Day
Now tell me how that sound? A double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the Judgement Day, stinkin' bitch
I bet you that I got something you ain't got
(Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier)
That's called courage
(Everywhere I see, a soldier like me)
It don't come from no liquor bottle
(Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier)
It ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon
(Everywhere I see, a soldier like me)
I don't walk around like no G
(Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier)
‘Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
(Everywhere I see, a soldier like me)
I don't try to act like you do
(Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier)
‘Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't?
(Everywhere I see, a soldier like me)

It's Tupac
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me13Embed
