Relivin' the past?
Your loss!
Rockstar, bitch, call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night, my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out first day of school
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
(Woo, woo, woo, woo)
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down (Woo)

This the cray-ist shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed, I might ride around on my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say, "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say, "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again

We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have88Embed
