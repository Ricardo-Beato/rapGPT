I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks, hit me when you done your shift
Woo, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby (Oh-oh)
Is you single or what? I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky, I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that (Woo)
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl, you ain't have to do him like that (Like that)
Why you had to do him like that? (Like that)
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh, you at the club cashin' out with Eric, damn, hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9 A.M. already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some "Why you love the strippers?" shit
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh
Oh, me, I don't deserve it (At least you fuckin' know it)
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no, not at all
I only text her, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift, yeah

Bitch so bad, could've thought I owed her somethin' by the way I broke her off (Broke her off)
When she get too on, when we take it off (Take it off)
Drank so long, for a year I didn't cough (Cough)
