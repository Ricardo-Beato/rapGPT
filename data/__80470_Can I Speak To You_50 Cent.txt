34 ContributorsCan I Speak To You Lyrics
Summer heat, hot, murder plots, niggas getting shot
Chrome rims for sixes, one wheel, one GSX-R
Throw it up, one hand, wave back at the bitches
I'm silent, right before I snap I'm violent
I call myself the tussle, I'm the boss and the muscle
Boy I feed your ass brass knuckles
A nigga come creeping through the fog, if you scared, get a dog
Get a male, because a bitch'll get you both in the morgue
Now peep the punchlines I'm punching these are knockout flows
I'm cyber pimping, I'm so new wave I got sci-fi hoes
This is next-level mack shit, that's why my money stack quick
12 V's V12 half of them triple black bitch
Lust, gluttony, greed, jealousy envy, me
Your blinds blurring your vision, see I'm where I'm supposed to be
On top of the underground, still gritty
Still running cities, Still Em, Dre and Fiddy, fuck with me
I'm an usual suspect when it's a hit
Turn up the volume and hear my voice, yeah it's the shit

Pardon me please, can I speak to you
Feel this is something, I'm compelled to do
Pardon me please, can I speak to you
Feel this is something, I'm compelled to do

Pistols and bad bitcHes, Hustlers and bad business
Rapping was just a Hobby, tHat Hobby turned to a million
Had tHat oxy for sale, you can get it 50 a pill
Sniff it or let it grill, rap tHe foil you know tHe drill
Money, power, and drugs, my only reason to love
Never played cops and robbers, nigga we played Crips and Bloods
Like to tHe pimps saying wHo the sluts? 211 on Hookers purses
Another double up purcHase, slanging a Hundred meters from cHurcHes
God forgive me, but tHe steal was wortH it
Man I swear I needed some cHange, cHains and golden rings and tHangs
Niggas watcH videos and tHink tHem dudes went from rags to Hardest
For real locs know tHat type of sHit makes you a target
EitHer tHe pigs or I'mma get you wHile you playing boy
Hunt you like an animal, strapped witH a beam tHat's adderall
50 told me ambition wins wHen your talent ain't working
I say I'd rather relapse tHan reenact Curtis and put tHat work in


Floss if you want to I've seen your Home broke nigga
It ain't a secret I get money, you's a joke nigga
Make wHat you make in like 2 years, less tHan a montH nigga
Figg Side to SoutHside but we up nigga8Embed
