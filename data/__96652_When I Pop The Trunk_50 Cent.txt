12 ContributorsWhen I Pop The Trunk Lyrics

Nigga no wait, no pine box, no funeral
Just 9 shots, take Pac 5, plus Big 4
You got 50, I love war
:
Who wanna box, with my ox
You wanna thump, I wanna dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
:
I think I got him, 10 shots, follow the trail of the blood drops
Fuck the police, better talk to Allah arc
Nigga you bleeding bad, yeah, you bleeding bad
Your Rolex soaked, like the kotex
You know next, it's gonna get dark
Where the cops when you fucking need them?
That blood filling your lungs boy, I see you weezin'
The harder you tryna run, the more you leakin'
You could have found something better to do this weekend
I got an arsenal, poison tips in my archery
Battery acid, I burn your face off properly
Guns ammo, knife Rambo
Nightmare, wake up I'm right there
You're hellbound, hell yeah!

Rider.. Gang!
Haaaaa!
Talk that shit now, I love it when you frontinÂ´
Eating all that pussy, guess cat got your tongue
Open up your mouth when say it to the pump
Buckshot come out the back of your neck like razor bumps
I'm too small to fight you can swing all you want
I box with the ox, you drop, I swing once (haaa!)
This a sad scene, at least you die happy
Next lick eater, it look like you was smiling at me
Damn Kidd Kidd, snuck me after he just dap me
Tell a nigga I'm grimy, bitch I'm from Mays am street (?)
If you holler gangsta shit, come get at me
I sprint like athletes in a track meet

Who wanna box, with my ox
You wanna thump, I wanna dump
