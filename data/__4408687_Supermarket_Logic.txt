33 ContributorsSupermarket Lyrics
Where is my girl?
The one I've been waiting for
I'd give you the world
If I wasn't stuck in this store
I'd give you the world
I think this here could start it
Come now, be my girl

Dance with me in this department
Inside of this supermarket, baby
With me in this department
Inside of this supermarket, baby
Yeah

I'm a weirdo, I'm a freak
I wish I could watch you when you sleep
I knew you before you knew me
Holy shit, I am a creep
I come to your job, just to buy some shit I don't need
Just to see your pretty face
It's probably odd I fantasize about your sweet love and embrace
Maybe one day, she'll be mine
I guess we'll all know in due time
I've got a heavy heart and a lot on my mind
But, beautiful girl, you're one of a kind
I'm not a stalker, but I go shopping
More than I need to, just to see you
I'm not a stalker, but I go shopping just to see you
(And when I don't, I say)
You might also like
Where is my girl?
The one I've been waiting for
I'd give you the world
If I wasn't stuck in this store
I'd give you the world
I think this here could start it
Come now, be my girl

Dance with me in this department
Inside of this Supermarket, baby
With me in this department
Inside of this Supermarket, baby
