75 ContributorsIntro (Under Pressure) Lyrics
Aight, or—higher probably, right?
Fuck it, just record it. Who cares?
One, two...

I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I'm not defined by the sales of my first week
'Cause in my mind, the only way I fail: if my verse weak
As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
Compiled of different races, gathering from different places
I just contemplate, shout out to those who can relate
And even though it gets hard I know my fate
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates, it's like

I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Looking for the sun in a world of gray
Feeling like my dream is a world away
I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Searching for the sun in a world of gray
Feeling like my dream is a world away
What it feel like?
I used to wonder what it feel like
Yeah, used to wonder what it
You might also like
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like

You can really do anything
You can really do anything
You can really do anything
You can really do anything
