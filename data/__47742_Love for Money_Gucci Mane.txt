I got the love for money, I got to have it
The lust for living lavish (Oh), gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I-I-I-I got to have it
Love for money, I-I-I-I got the love for money (Gangsta Grillz)

The lust for living lavish, gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I-I-I-I got to have it (Shoutout to LAPD)
Love for money, I-I-I-I got the love for money (Gangsta Grillz)

Chillin' with two women, me & Mr. Thanksgiving (Oh)
I be somewhere fly, Thanksgiving goin' swimmin' (Goin' swimmin')
While you was wearin' snorkels, I was out snorkelin'
Of course, I'm shittin' on these niggas like porcelain (Porcelain)
It's more than love with this money, I'm infatuated (Infatuated)
Captivated by the diamonds encapsulated (Uh-huh)
Shootin' range in the basement, Olympic size pool (Yeah)
A pool table adjacent, I love me some money
You might also like
I stash money, fast money, come on, I'm pumpin' them onions (Jeans)
Buckin' and crossin' the country, Sosa, don't cross me you monkey (Don't cross me)
Sleepin' on fifties and twenties, rollin' up onions and hundreds
Pullin' in Porsche's and Phantom's, fancies be throwin' they panties
Drama and Cannon they family, Gucci and Drama they panic (Yeah)
Ugh, they sick, they vomit, put some more commas in front it  (Ugh)
Drama got Gucci, he stunted, Gucci and Drama, we jammin' (Zone)
We got so much money 'bout our money, so money, more money dummy (Gangsta Grillz)

See money, money got a big house (Ah)
Money got a bad girl, money make you famous (Yeah)
Money rule the whole world, money set trends (Uh)
Money is in the Benz, money got associates actin' like friends (Yeah)
Money money, he old, money money, he bold (Huh)
Money got sexy ladies dancin' on the pole (Yeah)
Money got 'em on the stroll, money, platinum and gold (Uh, uh)
Money make 'em shake it like Beyonc√© Knowles
Only God knows the things I do for money
That's a young fly bad bitch, a tenderoni
Check out them dimensions, twenties, fifties and hundreds
Don't she make me look good when you see us out stuntin'?
Niggas catch a whiff, find out that's your bitch
Catch a pusher in your whip, then they go and push them clips
She got me goin' crazy, I'm coo coo for boo-koo bucks
Plus I can't lie boo, it's only you I love (Gangsta Grillz)

I got the love for money, I got to have it
The lust for living lavish (Oh), gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I-I-I-I got to have it
Love for money, I-I-I-I got the love for money
I got to have it
The lust for living lavish, gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I-I-I-I got to have it
Love for money, I-I-I-I got the love for money

I'm 'bout my issue, I'm 'bout my dough
I'm on my hustle, man, you already know
I'm hittin' stains, I'm hittin' liqs
I'm packin' pounds and baggin' bricks
You got them nicks, I got a lab
You talkin' whole's but sellin' halves
Where's your connect? How much he got?
That's all he holdin'? Man, I'll buy him out
I got the love for money, I got to have it
The lust for living lavish (Oh), gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I-I-I-I got to have it
Love for money, I-I-I-I got the love for money
I got to have it
The lust for living lavish, gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I-I-I-I got to have it
Love for money, I-I-I-I got the love for moneyEmbed
