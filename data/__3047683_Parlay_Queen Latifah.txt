Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Slip? You fall prey, go out the hard way
Receive a caution, fuck the flossing
Slip and be costing
Strictly big bossing to get the fortune
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Slip? You fall prey, go out the hard way
Receive a caution, fuck the flossing
Slip and be costing
Strictly big bossing to get the fortune

You not ready to test the La
Faking the funk
Confess or die
Not physically, but lyrically
Come on, give it your best try
The flow's coming
Don't get caught up in it
Talking about straps and gats
When the only tools you had had water in it
Wait a minute, I'm about to spark shit
If you smoking 20 blunts a day
Chances are you smoking garbage
A whore bitch? No me, no never
Too clever, too feminine
I'm on the winnin-in
Selector rewind and come again
Then let it drop again, don't stop again
Rappers is petty
Latifah coming for her props again
No matter where in the US you reside
Lyrically I commit justifiable homicide
I represent the felines
The kind that used to like to tree climb
And been respected since I start to speak mine
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Sleep? You fall prey
Go out the hard way
You might also like

Beyond lights and cameras
Behind the glamours
Ghetto scramblers with broken rammers
Cock the hammers
Fuck the flash and stashin' Benjamin grands and Jacksons
Money's the passion
Greeds the lust for satisfaction
Cash flow like Castro
Fast dough don't last though
Would you'd have let the mass know?
Feds don't let that ass go
 on your trail since uncover surveillance
Ya man in jail tense
He's one of two assailants
Peeps the lesson
Use the 'xpression
Times are stressing
No depression, minds advanced like The Jetsons
No dirt where you be at
Think before you react
It's the famous  that's
Quick to bring the heat back
Made moves wrong? Fortune's gone, you're singing sad songs
Still reminiscing about the days you was on
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Slip? You fall prey
Go out the hard way

La Fem Markita & Latifah
Givin' you what you need
What it be about?
Heineken to the head
Yin to the yang

We vacation in places where the nation's language is French
Ride the whip to Merrill Lynch
While others ride the bench
We come through in the clench
You never see us flinch
Your cheese come in increments
Mine come 'til I'm drenched
Slim bars from the femme squad
Chick meaner than M-Ra
Wanna spar? We can go par
5'2", leave your chin scarred
No complication
Mine and conquer nations
Deep concentration
Realize the comp you're facing
Ay yo, hand over this
Gettin' money hand over fist
No time to parlay
Hunting them hundreds that's crisp
Producers that's A-list
Lyrics that lace this to
Make sure these hits never miss
When we play this
Fem Markita, Queen Latifah, the double feature
A track done by each for thoughts to reach ya
Parlay? Hardly. Get money all day
Slip? You fall prey
Go out the hard way
