56 ContributorsBreak It Down Lyrics
Uh, feeling like I gotta get it right now
Moving like a killer in the darkness outta sight now
On another level, so the devil wanna fight now
Growing up dirt broke, but it's looking bright now
Bitches on the pipe now, want the dick right now
But I can't fade, taking shots with the sight down
Uh, uh, yeah, I coulda died that day
But I guess God don't ride that way
Chillin' in the cut, getting high all day
With a couple bad bitches, I'ma do it my way
Driven by the way that I be livin', everything I got 'em giving
Why you think they can't do it like me? Uh

I'ma get high
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Break it down, roll it up)
I'ma get high
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma get high
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Break it down, roll it up)
I'ma get high
Yeah, yeah, yeah

No, I don't smoke, but I'm feeling like
Maybe getting green'll get a brotha' feeling hella right (Uh)
Bitches on my dick, but I don't give a damn (Yeah)
Blowin' up my phone, trynna get the dinner plan
Back stage with the homies 'bout to get it, man
Fuck a fifteen minute man
Look young, but I been a man
All that ringtone rap, make a brother wanna kill a man
I am just a sinner, man, keep it real, yeah, that been the plan
You know we always do it for the fans
I be super low key like No I.D. (Uh)
Always in the lab, yes sir, that's me (Yeah)
Label that I'm reppin', that's VMG
From the womb to the tomb, we be keepin' it G (Logic)
What you know about me?
Everybody know that I be reppin' that 301, fuck around and get sonned
West Deer Park, that's where I'm from

Feeling like I gotta bring it back again
Always on another level, don't know how to act again
I be on that real (real), no I never back down
You don't wanna fuck around, busting like a MAC now
Started from the bottom, ain't no way I'ma go back down
Slack now, harder motherfucker, hell naw, never that now
Tell me that they love me, I don't give a fuck
Boy chillin' in the cut, bad bitch, far from a slut
