D.a. got that dope
Oh, yeah

Yellow blue canaries, all these diamonds that's on me lookin' heavy (Uh-huh)
All these bitches just talkin' hella scary, all these niggas with money don't impress me (Uh-huh)
Yeah, I get it's nothin' y'all can tell me (Uh), all my shooters completely voluntary
All these bitches just talkin' hella scary, one of one bitch, I'm different, don't compare me (Big Don)

I'll beat a bitch with a baseball bat
Got a new AP, see the face on that
Lot of rap hoes wack, these the same ol' tracks (Huh)
Wouldn't pop if you put Drake on that (Yeah)
Everything gang and it stays on that (Uh-huh)
Got these LV's for a stain those facts
Not just anybody gotta watch my back (Back)
Put on all my jewelry, make a broke ho mad
Outside, press a ho quick
Now they pretend they don't know shit
I'm like, "So bitch", they like, "No, bitch"
I was talking 'bout so and so bitch
I go off dick and got so rich, SoHo, I was so lit
Chloe, Prada, Rick owens, Oscar's
That's four fits, make you forfeit (Huh)
