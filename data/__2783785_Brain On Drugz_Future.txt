6 ContributorsBrain On Drugz Lyrics
Cut throat man, been rockin' with Freebandz, Escomo city since day one nigga
I remember smokin' blunts in yo basement, me you and future
Nigga talkin; bout how big this shit gon be how epic this shit gon be, you can go nowhere without hearin' no Future, no Esco
Salute, DJ Cutthroat big homie

Let me inhale the chronic smoke
I can't lie I'm addicted to the dope
My brain on drugs
I fucked around and took a prescription pill
Ask my ex how it feel when my my brain on drugs
Sip, sip, sip, sip, cup after cup, I can't get enough
My brain on drugs, and it's sad to say
All the kids out there it's very bad to say, my brain on drugs

I'm crumbling herb , I stuff me a swisher
I light up the tree, every day round here it be Christmas
I'm clouding my thoughts, my words comin' out doper
And I'm always high, that's what I got locs for
I'm on a real strong pack, that California OG
I'm smoking blunt after blunt , like snoop D-O double G
It's hard to keep it low key , when you smell like a whole P
I wake up every single morning, twisting up me some green
You might also like
Let me inhale the chronic smoke
I can't lie I'm addicted to the dope
My brain on drugs
I fucked around and took a prescription pill
Ask my ex how it feel when my my brain on drugs
Sip, sip, sip, sip, cup after cup, I can't get enough
My brain on drugs, and it's sad to say
All the kids out there it's very bad to say, my brain on drugs

I sip codeine , Oxycontin, xanax, xanax
Come fly with me (Michael Jordan) can you handle it, handle it?
On two of em, I can't even talk
That's Pluto, That's Pluto
Have you ever been to Molly world?
If you Ain't been there, Suggest you don't go

Let me inhale the chronic smoke
I can't lie I'm addicted to the dope
My brain on drugs
I fucked around and took a prescription pill
Ask my ex how it feel when my my brain on drugs
Sip, sip, sip, sip, cup after cup, I can't get enough
My brain on drugs, and it's sad to say
All the kids out there it's very bad to say, my brain on drugsEmbed
