34 ContributorsLife After Death Intro Lyrics
Previously on Ready to Die

... me and her sister had something going on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
(A-yo, you listening to me motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
(Eyo, c'mon nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talking
*BANG*
(Ayo Big, ayo Big!)

*heartbeat slows, sound of ambulance sirens*
*sound of pulse monitor and breathing machine*

Damn... we was s'pose to rule the world baby
We was unstoppable!
The shit can't be over, no
The shit can't be over, man
I know you hear me nigga
I know you hear me
You got too much livin' to do
Too much unfinished business
It ain't over
*flatline*
