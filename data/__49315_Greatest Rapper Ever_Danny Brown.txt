48 ContributorsGreatest Rapper Ever Lyrics
My homie a magician with the Tec (Tec)
Make your chain disappear and reappear on his neck (Neck)
I ain't tricking with your hoes (Nah), but, shit, don't ask 'em (Nah)
Only thing I give a bitch: A fucking orgasm (Chyeah)
I'll throw you in the river (River), hands tied tight (Tight)
Watch your ass drown, feel it in the air tonight (Tonight)
I'm spitting that dope shit (Dope), smoking on regulars (Ugh)
Writing sixteens like internet child predators (Chyeah)
Rocking that 10 Deep, but I stay dolo
You wearing Polo (Ugh)—who are you, Young Dro? (Young Dro)?
I'm fifth floor at the Bellagio (Chyeah)
Vegas bitches that's resembling Rosario—
Dawson, awesome (Ugh), hit the head, Mario (Ugh)
Sorry, yo, my tongue long, she squirted off the sheets (Ugh)
She gave me that Becky (Becky), I gave her that Yoshi (Yoshi)
The only time you niggas touch keys is Motif (Yeah)
Go and sell a beat (Beat), you never sold a rock (Rock)
Still be sitting on the couch if I was signed to Koch (Uh-huh)
Could've signed to the Roc, nah, I'm signed to the streets (Ugh)
The D the only thing that's profiting for me (Yeah)
Feeling like Big Meech (Meech) when he 'bout to cook up
But not the one from B.M.F., dog, the one from Linwood (Linwood)
It ain't a nigga I know (Know)
Three years straight (Straight), three-dollar blows (Chyeah)
Good, any hood, anywhere I go, I'm straight (Straight)
Nigga hit me with a hundred 'cause the look on my face (Ugh)
Mama, I'm honored to be your son (Yeah)
Could snatch a stack of stamps out and not rip a single one (Ugh)
Used to be in a rush (Ugh) to finish off my sack (Sack)
I was so thirsty, dog, sold a pregnant bitch crack (Damn)
Let her pay me extra (Ugh), smoke it in the back (Ugh)
Then she came back (Back)
Titties out, smacking herself on the back (Back)
Talking 'bout something crawling on her (Ugh)
Looking like the world falling on her (Ugh)
And I pushed it (Push)
You rub the foots of the bitches I mush (Mush)
Funky-ass Cutlass, three deep, blowing kush (Kush)
North got her shook
Started reading when the judge threw the fucking book (Chyeah)
But the block was off the hook (Hook), said, "Fuck class!" (Ugh)
Off them same pills that had Carlton dancing fast (Ha)
Young buck, look, now a grown-up
Now, I pop them same pills, listening to Donuts (Chyeah)
I rap like I bet my life (Life)
'Cause in all actuality, nigga, I did (Nigga, I did)
You rap like you used to hit the pipe
Nah, nigga that ain't crack, that's crackhead shit
Rep that shit (Shit), will tell a bitch (Bitch)
You wouldn't break a brick, you ain't seeing this dick (Nah)
You trick on the bitch (Bitch), dog, you ain't rich
Take a bitch to the movies, take her to the crib (Ugh)
You seeing Brown? Nope, never
'Bout to live the title of the greatest rapper ever (Ever)
It don't get no better (Better)
It don't get no better (Chyeah)You might also like8Embed
