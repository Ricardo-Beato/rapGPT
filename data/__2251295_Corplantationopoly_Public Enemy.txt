And the apple bite me back)

Uh!
Corplantationopoly
Corplantationopoly

Bump bump bump bump bump bump bumpin
Music you love, owned by something
Pity pity, flock to these cities
Seem to forgot, punch the robot
New ways replace the old daze
Know the old guys rule in disguise
(But let me get my money)
Owning them masters
Corplantations making disasters

To the beat y’all, you don’t stop
To the beat y’all, you don’t quit

Manipulate thought
Bait and switch, mind corp
Caught but never taught, who owns the corp?
Free the body, arrest the spirit
Everybody’s looking around waiting for them to hear it
Capital court, ad psyche
Soul is bought, your soul just might be
Triggered by greed that feeds the lust
They live for the pleasure
The high, the head rush
You might also like

Bump bump bump bump bump bump bumpin’
Bump bump bump bump bump bump bumpin’
Bump bump
How can I say this?
Here I go
Here go the black hippy
Cause they trippin’
C’mon get wit me


Bump bump, how can I say this?
Corplantations spreading that matrix
Pity pity, flock to these cities
Seem to forgot, punch the robot
Made a livin’, steal thanksgivin’
The law been givin’, blood in my pocket
Can’t stop the corporate prophet
Out for just profit, dare you to stop it
