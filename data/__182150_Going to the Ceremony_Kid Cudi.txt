"Now certainly, we all recognize the extremely, extremely low probability of life existing on the moon."
Hmm, hmm, alright
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Drinking again, drinking again
Bottles up, I'm in it to win
With none of my friends, just me and this bottle
People say that I'm off, say that I'm off
I wouldn't doubt it if you were me
Free as a bird, flying over mountains
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm going

It's all happening
I'm going
It's all happening

Hate what I see, hate what I see
I'm over it, I need me some change
Something to feel good, get me on a level
No, no, no need to cry, no need to cry
You straighten up, you're such an adult
You pay all your bills, yet you are a zombie
And you don't know where you're going
But you're going
You might also like
It's all happening
I'm going
It's all happening
We're going
It's all happening40Embed
