51 ContributorsTrying to Find a Balance Lyrics
They love the taste of blood
Now I don't know what that means, but I know that I mean it
Maybe they're as evil as they seem
Or maybe I only look out the window when it's scenic
Atmosphere finally made a good record
Yeah right, that shit almost sounds convincing
The last time I felt as sick and contradictive as this
Was the last time we played a show in Cincy
"Get real", they tell me
If only they knew how real this life really gets
They would stop acting like a silly bitch
They would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it

Doesn't take much and that's messed up
Because these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us
While everyone was trying to out-do the last man
I was just a ghost trying to catch some Ms. Pac-man
Hello ma'am, would you be interested
In some sexual positions and emotional investments
See, I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking, "Yo where did all the passion go?"
East coast, West coast, down South, Midwest
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Somebody give me a big yes
God bless America, but she stole the B from Bless (and kept it)
Now I'm too fucked up to dance
So I'mma sit with my hand down the front of my pants
You can't achieve your goals if you don't take that chance
So go pry open that trunk and get those amps
You might also like
In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance

So now I keep a close eye on my pets
Because they make most of they moves off of instinct and scents
It's eat, sleep, fuck, and self-defense
So straight you can set your clocks and place bets
Wait, let's prey on the blind, deaf, dumb, dead
Hustle, maybe a couple will love what you said
Emcees drag their feet across a big naked land
With an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hand
Yeah, I got some last words, fuck all of ya'll
Stop writing raps and go play volleyball
Gotta journey the world in a hurry
Cause my attorney didn't put enough girls on the jury
Guilty of dropping these bombs in the city
But I'm innocent, love is the motive, that's why I'm killing 'em
Guilty of setting my fire in all fifty
But I'm innocent, blame it on my equilibrium

In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance
Now all my friends are famous
It's either one thing or another
They all don't know what my name is
Probably know both of my brothers
The one is a hard workin' savior
The other's a hard workin' soldier
I'm just your next-door neighbor
Working hard at tryin' to stay sober
You wait for the car at the corner
Pretend like you know what the plot is
Won't quit till I hit California
And make you my Golden State goddess11Embed
