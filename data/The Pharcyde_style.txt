In times recent I haven't been content
Since my ears and years realized the abstraction of content;
Lyrical
All across the continent they took it and they filled it with   Some moralist material
Way back in the days it used to be varieties like cereal
And to bring it back I think it's gonna take a miracle, reason
We brung the fresh to get ya hung
So all tongues of gibberish, I wish they'd be done
Run, away far with no tussle
Cause it seems like all these guys are paralyzed
Up in the mental muscle
What they need to be is muzzled
Imani got the pieces, but I still feel puzzled
Phonies run out fast cause all the gas gets guzzled
But what time reveals is that he steals the rest
They're all stealing that will when they're under pressure
Dealing in stolen treasures for their personal pleasures
And that's wrong, you know that's not right
That's why every night I go in my room and I write
In the boom, in my room
Cause it's all good, G
And that's the way that everything should be

Many kingdoms rely on its people
That makes the balance equal so we all make moss
Serving common duties of the man on his block
Making ends meet the means into fiending at the park
Now black zeus stole crack, got beat with bumper jacks
And cats too laid back got jacked
Seeing a sister almost pass on my grandma's grass
Because the brother tried to stomp the fuckin juice out her ass
I never knew the real story
Grammar break bone
They going to wash away the sins in evil men
Gave up Pratt and a her pimp
Too much crime, the wretchest shit
And the places he'd been; I won't quit
Cause those who pose about the streets just lie in the pits
Where the shoe fits em, and yo
I can't get with them due to the fact that life is just
Somethin' they lack and they won't confess
They need a little somethin' like soul in their chest
And some love up in their shit, and they will be blessed
And ya don't stop, just some cultivation of the crops
And none of this shit is for the props
Straight from the top, so now don't ya miss
Cause all of you suckers will get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this

To me you ain't nothing
Gone with my weed, the done deal
The best rapper in the world blowing right now, forreal
You call that shit skill?
Nigga, please suck my dick
In one hand I got a mic, in the other an open fist
What? You want to get wrapped up or smacked
Like a  Innocent victims of my show
But it ain't their rhymes punk, cause Buckwheat said so
I'm penetrating, escalating my devastation
Proves that I removes emcees like prayers to Satan
Rebuke
Cause you blowing up? It's a flook
I'm doper than that fool that you hide behind in your group
Loop the last two lines I just said
Play it over again ten times in your head
Weak link, like a midget in quicksand you sink
I out-think ya, see through your whole outfit
I'm irresistible, unmissable, Buckwheat's the shit
Like an elephant, bitch rapper don't forget it
Steppers like pulling blenders in gunfights, you with it
Rhyme riddler, making niggas hail me like Hitler
Insane, everybody do the Kurt Cobain, the greatest rapper
That ever lived; Buckwheat and that's my nameEmbed
Yo, I dedicate this to you and you and you
And you and you and you
And you right there

Yeah, broadcasting live and direct from sunny
Sunny sunny shiny Southern California
Where it never rains, I’ve warned ya
About the G’s, and the palm trees, and the convertible lo-lo
G-rides, bitches, and beaches, and britches and bean pies
Freaks with green eyes
Guys wearing disguise, used to be men
Now they women trying to blend in
Yeah, all from the town from the sound
Known for the niggas that’s known to get down
And isn’t it ironic
It’s more to L.A. than drive-by shootings, carjackings and The Chronic
Yeah, look a little closer
Move real slow and do what you’re supposed to
Got a poster with Kobe-Kob’ and Shaq
Home of the Lakers and the money-makers, that’s a fact

And we’re living in the lifestyle
Living with the rich and famous and the poor and aimless
Living where life’s wild
Doing the same old same and we do it again

LA LA, the city of smog
Some gangstas wear suit and ties, some drive a hog
Went to the same high school, even shared a class
One quick to sue, the other quick to blast
Me, I don’t ask what’s wrong or right
Nubian queen turned hoochie in the night
Also turn vampire and they bite, leaving marks to switch
Rollin’ on Wilshire with the poor and rich

Never gave me the time of day
Now I’m just a rhyme away, from the summit
Now they tryin’ to find a way, to spark somethin’
After we done marked somethin’
Like dogs do, already involved
Embers in the dark shed light into the park
So we can play again
Heart’s been astray, now I know the way again
Big old price to pay again
After layin’ ‘round, you know the sound

And we’re living in the lifestyle
Living with the rich and famous and the poor and aimless
Living where life’s wild
Doing the same old same and we do it again

Shielded by the spirit of debt
1-5’er, 1-9’er, ’71 is when the mission begun in Irvine
I’ve been all around but I really love the Cali sunshine

See, it’s a very small world (where we’re from)

No place like it in the world (where we’re from)

Hustlers and fly girls trying to get some

Welcome to the place where the sun submerge
The sky’s not the only place where stars emerge
On dreams we purge, to kill our urge
Aspirations embedded like handprints at the Chinese
Convertible down, warm Santa Ana breeze
While you’re cruisin’ on the 10, from sand to sand
Some represent with the ‘W’ on their hand
Often I say “dude”, I’m talking to my man
Grab the tan in the laid back land
There’s nine million stories and every game ranEmbed
She keeps passin' me by

She keeps passin' me by

Now in my younger days when I used to sport a shag (Sport a shag)
I would go to school, carry lunch in a bag (In a bag)
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss (Get a kiss)
Always got mad when the class was dismissed (Was dismissed)
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stand, come to my desk
And help me with my problem for it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent or sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up promptly at three o'clock
But I was on the jock, yes indeedy, wrote graffiti on the bus (On the bus)
I'd carve her name then write a plus
With my name last (Last), on the looking glass (Glass)
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)

Now when I dream of fairytales, I think of me and Shelly
'Cause she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play love by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her nigga, but
All I could do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played Truth or Dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop the stride
'Cause I can't have no more of this passin' me by

And I must voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken (Chicken), chasing my tail like a doggie
She was like a star (Star), thinking I was like a fan (Fan)
Damn, she looked good (Good), down side: she had a man (Man)
He was a rooty-toot, he was a nincompoop
She told me, "Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop"
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass, I proved to be a better man
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her:
"My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I feel for you when I try
Or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you"
Signed "Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, P.S. Love Me Tender"
But the letter came back three days later: Return to Sender
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (She keeps passin' me by)
She keeps passin' me by

Uh, do you take, Rhymealinda

To be your lawfully wedded wife? (Do you really love me?)
Uh, uh
I do, I do, no, I don't, I do

Ah, roomie-zoom-zoom, I'm off to be wed
To Rhymealinda, I remember, um, when we first met
In '82, back in school, used to play up all the fools
Sometimes, you'd be my number five, sometimes you'd be my twenty-two
But, um, screw the dumb shit, 'cause little Rhymea's true
I can't wait to say "I do," and oh yeah, honey, there's no due
I got my chariot rollin', now I'm mic controlling
Got some spunk in my funk, I can't wait to put some soul in
We're rollin' all strikes, we're havin' little tykes
One is little Mike, the other's Ike, I'm sure that you would like
To hold 'em, or maybe stroll 'em on their little bikes
When they're born, I've sworn, to bring 'em up right, you know
Dope is how I breed em, beats is what I'll feed em
They'll be healthy like a health nut, I'm sure you'll shake your butt
Kick the verse, preacher, and I won't disperse
Here's my life, Rhymealinda, for better or for worse

And you don't stop, you don't stop (What?)
And you don't stop, you don't stop (What?)

I gotta get the bread (Bread), gotta get the butter (Butter)
Fix it up, eat it down, throw it in the gutter

Skinny-dipped into her ass as if it was a pool of water
Now the water's gettin hotter, so I bought her a new ring

I gotta kiss her ass, my tongue I hold before I curse

You tried to make me beg
But I had to insist, I had to insist, I (Oh my God)

You trippin' on my ego, but all my shit is sustained
Order, order, I cross the border for a spot in the sun
I'm so down with myself, bitch, I could chill as a bum, ho hum
Drum, I'm so burnt that I'm beat
I got my peers on my nuts and the crowd on my feet
The only one who has my back is me, in reality, see
I'm constantly fighting envy when we journey through the sea
Oui, oui, monsieur, I'm true to the game, I believe, my friend, you slip me

I woke up in the morning to a girl who's butt's soft
Gotta brush my teeth, clean my nuts off
Put on the gear that I'ma wear throughout my day
But before I take a shower, I ain't ashamed to say
When I think of the night before and the heat of passion
Your big brown booty, my mind starts flashin'
I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you or just stroke my knot?
While my girl is asleep, I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom with cocoa butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me, locked it very tight
Thinkin' of all the nasty things we did last night
Slipped out my underoos, sat on the toilet bowl
And let the hand I hold the mic with take control
Closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real
I'm thinkin' about the crazy ways you made me feel
As my thoughts get deeper and a little more intense
If you don't know what comes next, well, you're just too dense

'Cause the other fish is better

It took a second to register up in my branium
My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talking
I had to creep through the hound dogs that were stalking
This slimmy caught me peeping
This means she wasn't sleeping on who I was
So she crept in like a hawk
In a minute's time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh, I hit a high note 'cause of the way that she was walking
We got into the groove, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought we'd be forever
Didn't have an umbrella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never simp, pimp, and leave your love life limp
There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid

I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be Olive Oyl's number one sailor
I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil
She's heavy on the mind, sometimes it's more than I can handle
But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den
Be macho, but a honcho like Pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not Oriental
A dame is supposed to claim you even if you drive a Pinto
A hero is a sandwich and a Manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper; are they fakin' or for real?
What's the deal, dabbers? Will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch licking drip drip from a nigga's benefits
He doesn't even suit you and he's surely not your size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when you open up your eyes, babe mermaid, I really wish
That you don't bruise a limb as I swim with other fish in the sea
In the sea, that is

Now, if there ain't no mountain high enough
Why ain't you climbing up?
My hand has been extended ever since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya
Bro, you're stupid 'cause you thought you captured Cupid
And you found that love ain't two bits of shit
So I resign and quit
It ain't even about the hips or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussy whip, Elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
I'd charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they stepping with my lady
They're working on a baby, I'm pushing up the daisies
But hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me Big Gibraltar, miss
No, I won't diss, I'm just like off to other fish in the sea

You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

Let me entertain you
And interphase you, with the new sound
Sound is the side and the Phar is the cyde
And no matter who you are, you know you can't hide
Not from the eyes of the sun or the moon or the stars
No matter who you are (Da-na-na-na)
Come in, and commence to the sound of my drumming

You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

Time to go all the way with it
Don't just sit there and stare or play with it
Cause we're committed to the seeds of the new breeds
The mothership of dreams where fiends breast feed
Step through reality into reality
So surreal you'll feel you never knew reality
Until it stood still now your far from a lie
When the truth tantalizes your eyes, see we already in the skies
Or outer space, standing here on the face of this earth
To the state to the grid of my turf
Where my mom gave birth
To all that she loves
Be it small to others, but yo, it's bigger than love
They did a cross examination of it
But you can't duplicate the state of our relations through translations
That's not the ticket
Breaking codes in Heiroglyphics
Trying to get down to the specifics

Yo, when money talks fools are always checkin'
Depositing their two cents
Foolishly convinced, blinded by their ignorance
That becomes a hinderance for them to rise
When they going to recognize, time waits for no man
When you going to stand and
Get up off of that bullshit, and stop fighting that feeling?

Now let me change the topic just a bit
Talk about the ips with the fat ass and tits
Comin' to the club, looking for a star
Ain't got ten dollars for a drink at the bar
Scoping around, looking for the best dressed
Smelling for the indo passing up the stress
Sniff sniff, yo, what does the ip smell?
A brother like Suave with a pocket that swell
Action was thrown, the ip was blown
Next thing you know, I had her at my home!
All alone, object to get paid
Only thing that happened was a ass got laid!
Now no ends and her ass was sprung
Used a little tongue, but believe I'm well hung
So lesson well learned for all you club hopping hoes
It ain't about the stardom and it ain't about the dough, so
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Before they let a new soul bloom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb

Cause everytime I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2 inch reels
That I don't even own

Early Saturday mornin I was cartoon gazin
Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own
Chorus: repeat 4X

I was po', black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out, wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed
I was coolin behind Coolio in the County Line
My big brother used to say I was an asshole
Didn't graduate, couldn't handle the hassle
Of high school, why fool
Wit' foolish rules and guidelines
Fuck the cap and tassels
Said forget the trade and tried rhymes
Hooked up with J-Swift, got with 2-4-2
Me and my nigga L.A. Jay back at S.C.U
I grab the MIC one-time
Check it, 1-2, we in
Freakin' major flavors with my fellow Nubians

I jet propel at a rate, that complicate their mental state
As I invade their Masquerade, they couldn't fade with a clipper blade
10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it
I let you take a swing, and you bunted for an easy out
I leave emcees with doubt of exceeding
My name is Bootie Brown and I'm proceeding, leading
They try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
I can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle of O.E
They have no key or no clue
To the game at all, now they washed up
Hung out to dry
Stand there looking stupid, wondering why
(why man?)
It was the fame, that they tried to get
Now they walking around talkin' about represent
And keep it real, but I got to appeal
'Cause they existing in a fantasy when holding the steel

Rock-a-bye baby
Listen to your heartbeat pumping to a fine
Ravine of all things it's a vain of a shrine
All missions impossible are possible, 'cause I'm
Headed for a new sector 365
Days from now, I'll wipe the sweat from my eye
And each and every true will stick or fall from the skies
Of my cloud nine
From homies all the way to chicks, no matter how fine
Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
And the world's at a standstill, deep in broken-man's-ville
Trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
Killing yourself, and dogging ya health
You ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself
(Shit is-shit is ill)
But through my will, my flow still will spill
Toxic slick to shock sick like electrocute
When I execute acutely over the rhythm
On those that pollute, extra dosages is what I gotta give 'em
Got 'em mad and tremblin'
'Cause I been up in my lab assemblin'
Missiles to bomb the enemy
Because they envy me and the making of my mad currency
Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
'Cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
And I think they can't follow
They can't swallow the truth because it hurts
This is how I put it down, this is my Earth, my turf
The worth of my birth is a billion
And you know what time it is I'm gonna make a million

Yeah, you know what time is it?

Your mama is so big and fat that she can get busy
With twenty-two burritos, but times are rough
I seen her in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (What?), your mama smokes crack (What?)
She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back
Her knuckles drag down to the ground when she walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk

Naked on a mountaintop, tooting on a flizute
Riding on a horse, drinking whiskey out a bizoot
She got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Your mama got a glass eye with the fish in it

She may have the muscles, but no, she's not cute
She's not pretty, oh, what a pity, got the glass titty
Filled up with Kool-Aid just for the kiddies

On a cliff butt naked, tootin' on a flute
Riding on a horse, drinking whiskey out a boot
She got the teeth and the wings of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Your mama got the wooden legs with real feet

I went to your house (What?), and she licked me on the cheek (What?)
I said, "Excuse me, lady
But I remember seeing you at the Palladium way back in September"
'Cause you was beatboxin' for Lou Rawls
In some bright red boxer drawers
You said your moms was pretty and young
But she's old as dirt and got hair on her tongue
Your moms, your moms, she uses Brut
And I saw her riding a horsey, drinking whiskey out a boot
She got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that

Aw, your mom is so fat (How fat is she?)
We rode up on her back to get some burgers from Wendy's
And her skates went flat, I got stuck in her butt crack
They thought I was lost, but I was caught by the G-strap
Heaven forbid a giant fart would give way
'Cause that would blow me 'round the world in a day
We drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
Because we dressed her up to look just like a Chevrolet

Naked on a mountaintop, tooting on a flizute
Riding on a horse, drinking whiskey out a bizoot
With the wings and the teeth of an African bat

It just look like she's just gliding across the floor8Embed
I was standing, one of the cast of many
I would give anything to swing hand in hand
With her but it was just a blur
I couldn't blame her, why give up fortune and the fame
For a nigga who can barely afford his name
So the dame kept aim at the stars
I'm often thinking about her
When I'm waitin on calls across the border
Made sure my rhymes in order cause
That moment could be near and it was
Now my attorney is tellin' me to sign here
So I appear and perform international
The time came she stepped to me I thought rational
But she knew I wanted it
She walked around and flaunted it like a peacock
I knocked the Reebok Now she jock
Blowin up the Pactel and the doorbell
Had to check myself as well love boat won't sail
Cause I'm no captain let them know from the start
I let you break me off but I won't let you
Break my heart

So I'm surrounded by bitches
Now this is the most incredible shit in Slim Kid history
So watch if you will the moment some good
Shit pops and they be foggin up ya grill
Overly thrilled to get you in ya ass like massingil
Still burnin shit now and I'm still learnin how not to fuck
With ya baby or make ya my old lady
You just overcasting ya ass is shady tryin to block
The sunlight with all of that hype and now I'm discontinue'n
All of this pipe that I've been layin as long as you keep
Swayin to anotha crew's tempo I gotta let you go and that's
Simple so get it through ya two temples because I'm
Tryin' to live fatter than a blimp ho
And you're exempt and I won't symp on a write off
So step out my world and turn the light off

She was my high school sweetheart down from start
When all I had was high hopes my health and my art
But when I got fame she became unsure
If I could still feel the same when I came off tour
I said "for sure" cuz what God gave us, girl, I'm grateful
No need to be insecure baby your nigga's faithful
So now I'm off doin' dates in a gang of states
And as my status elevates I see the baddest eights
At the backstage gate lookin' great straight
Waitin for a nigga so now I figure
"Hey I only live once I'm goin' all out today"
Made a call out to L.A. to say what had to say...
Now I get back the very next week only to learn
The tables turned like a technique twelve hundred
Last thing in the world that I wanted was my girl goin' out every
Night gettin blunted
And zooted with a clique of well known
Reputed groupie hoes from all the hip hop shows
Backstage with her little backpack tryin to get chose
By anotha nigga with talent wealth and fame
Oh I suppose I guess I got myself to blame
For turning her out into a hip hop freak
Now I seek counseling
From a therapist twice a week
So let me speak about the freak So let me speak about the
Freak
Instantly she made another selection
Because he was in the lime plus had
The money connection "correction"
"way more paid" is why she laid and played
A charade in the game of deception
This Miss-mysterious mistress is just an actress
Of the mattress cuz she's a wanna be mack-tress
Well built-but equipped with the tackiest of tactics
And I hate it why this is dedicated to all of them
Type of women who still be swimming Lost and confused
In the lake of illusion with no values is why they're
Constantly losin'1Embed

Life is just a moment in time (x4)

I recall being three when Sunny passed away
One of the greatest in my eyes till this very day
Too young to understand but understood the ways of good and evil
Life and death was in the breath of times fate
And God only knows what kept Peggy straight
Cuz in the very next year my Aunt Dorothy was the late
More beautiful than the word it was like killing a mocking bird
She was so young like the new year was all you heard
Almost saw it so clear the good times that we had
When my Momma showed me pictures life wasn't so bad
I got baby sat By Pat when Bedie was a small guy
And in our cousins eyes we were both small fries
Jazzywazzys growing up to be a big girl now
Father figure understands a man might like her profile

Ain't heavenly peace and harmony family season and it goes...

Tweaking diodes I walk the roads like karate masters
Most the time my mind be ghost like Casper sinkin faster
But coming up in this shit sometimes I'm alienated, underrated
Suckas hate it that I made it as a misfit
But you know if the shoe fits I'mma wear it like a glass slipper
Hike to the big dipper, dip like a skipper, no top could be tipper (say what?)
But fools be tryin to rape friends to make friends
And that's one big twisted ass picture
Like Jack the Ripper
Caught up in the net like Flipper on a tuna protest, yeah, where's the focus
Got me fuckin with these friends and they crackin' my lens
And now, shit be'z foul as a mutha

To realize and define the whole truth

Lookin to advance in this world that's monopolized so I utilize
Careful not to jeopardize on my chances

I had a couple of homies that went to Kansas and Colorado

I'm a lone desperado on the come up who rather sum up
Siskel gets paid to sit down with his thumb up
Asshole, watch cash flow take a downfall when your shit not on the ball
Who you gonna call?
Hustle hustle hustle hustle

First you see a flash & then you smell smoke
Schmooche cat, controllin the whole scene
As my people choke, the hustle
I want to be down & all off into it
Like Russell Simmons, I like the women's
The hers not the him, Ipass L's to my bredren
In my pocket stacks ends
But I always find myself saying, please excuse me sir
Place down your
Bottle
I didn't mean to step upon your eypps throttle
And get her overheated ready to be treated
For the Schmooche Cat addiction affection
To her state and being I had her seeing triple visions
Blue mountain tops and purple valley
Wantin' to hang with her eypps in my alley

"None of that's true", we do it not you
That' why I got you, stuck on to my style like glue
The crew, definitely is back again
But I'm back to win, so just tell a friend
That I'm still twisting and bending
Minds and rhymes until the very end
With the rhymes, and the loops
Stomping out wack troops in my big black boots
Collecting respect and the loot
From the way I grab the microphone and execute
"Iaph's" think I'm cute

(SAY WHAT?)
Yo man, I pay them no attention I stay deep into the cut
Cause I leave the tricks alone cause the name is not David
Copper-Filled pockets, never made it don't hate it

Be like that, it just be like that
Baby tell me why it's gotta be like that
(x4)

I wasn't sleepin I was creepin’, slidin', hidin'
I would like the girl behind me roll up a bad time thinkin'
Mentally sinkin’, presently brinkin’
Two decades and a half makin’ a path for mine to follow
The world is hollow, yet it's full of crap prepare to gamble
I give you a handful of chips and tips
For what's to come, I cried a ton of tears
Drunk a ton of beers, that's fun at first
But learned to persevere throughout the years
Kept my ears open, eyes scoping mouth locked
Don't rock the boat if you can't swim
Nobody may be there with the limb to lend
This is the end, still I can't explain the fact
Why the fuck shit gotta be like that?


Know what, I said it
Hear me clearin' over so severe and dreaded
That they need to be beheaded
Why? I'm readily, steadily stimulating and mutilating
All sloppily copied imitations, cause they irritatin'
So I'm intimitading them over the snare
With simply a stare
Bringin them turbulent terror
And they know this ‘cause they can feel it
He knew that it was mine still the sucker tried to steal it
So I had to reveal it, through provin’
That I am astonishing and fly
And by just blinking my eye
In a flash I flush out the face, layin' low-key
Trained eyes locate to focus on the phony
Mister sometime-homey, why he act like that
I thought he had my back
I thought he had our backs
But it was him who I should've never trusted
And not at least till he got his attitude adjusted
Or mouth busted for acting all dusted, but bust this
Now when I'm out I seek and thought out the whole scene
For all sinister types, sneaks that scheme
They come into my face, I send them tightmen home
When they be suffering from the double-agent syndrome
Why it gotta be like that?

People think I'm high but I'm mentally travelling
Aging is your times cause life's unraveling
While I'm straddlin' walls up this fuckin' mic
I hate to be a pilot crashin' in a flight
People need to know about this thing called life
Cause if you see the light then life's alright

I jumps inside the jeep as I embark on my dark mission
Popped in my freestyle tapes, started reminiscing
About my little homie, who was raised in Wyoming, wanted to be famous
So he came to Californey on the microphony
He was super bad and what not
But he was the kinda fella to follow fads that was hot
He became too fascinated with that gang related flavor
That he modificated, rearranged his behavior
He hooked up quick with the influential slang
Gangsta-stroll, cornrolls; the whole shabbang
Braggin' and boastin, boastin' and braggin
How he mostly be hangin' with baby gees I was baggin'
Like why you tryin' to ride up on the bandwagon
Hopin' they'd hit him in the head, but he steady saggin'
Like he a hog
Creepin' through the smog
Smokin' on some indo sippin' on a cup of O-Dog
Like most who come to this West Coast society
Try to be because they think it's fly to be a menace
So what a relic way to end this
Got rolled up when he was strolling
On a Sunday at the Venice
Some niggas never listen they gotta learn their lesson
The hard way I'm guessin' yessin'
Deedy as I hit the Beady and make a right on Weston
Pops in my head the proverbial question

Now everyday I wake up I take out time
To give thanx that I'm still existing
Still insisting
That my people open up their eyes up
And wise up so we all can rise up
WAY ABOVE the rim of the muck
But we can't if we're stuck
In I don't give a fuck
And lost in a daze Lost in a maze
Trapped in amazement
And hard as cement is the head
And that why soon everything'll be dead
And red is the color of the blood that's spilling
And hella amounts is the totals of the killing
I'm tellin' ya is the sky is falling
But all you're worried about is sky balling
You're failing way outta control
And you ain't doing nothing but losing ya soul

For our doom but we assume that we immune
To death while niggas
Drippin sweat tryin to hold their breath
But aah! they slept while the time just crept
Now they tryin to awake but it ain't much left
Sometimes I think we blind either
No hope or faith my people can't wake up
We sleepin through the day
Think it's all great but to me it really ain't
When its time to face reality we turn to a drank
Or some dank then we can't think straight lets

Over such and such ends that such and such owes

I guess everybody needs somebody to love
You can't leave love lonely
Cause being naive to it you can just lose it like that
See kisses for bruises don't make it heal back
It be's the sex appeal that's from the next and not necessarily the sex and
One might appeal to the intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type of chemistry
That flairs when her desires on fire
Quick is the fuse, another loves for hire

And she said...

Looking right cause my shit is tight
Blazing blunts to city lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights
Bounce to the House of Blues then I slid in free
With tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans, and no ID
Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the fizace
Of an epp with an iz-ass more amazing than grace
So I waste no time to kick my line
I say, "How ya doing?" She say, "I'm doin' fine"
So I commence to macking to baby to see what's cracking
So maybe I get her back at the cabin and start attacking
Threw back a shot of yack and started jabbering
Jibbing, fibbin, and ad libbing just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed, bumping some Isley
Thought I was about to spread the thighs but she surprised me
When she said, "Oh like that? You know I don't get down."
I know my homies gonna clown cause I let her stick around when—

But she's been waitin all night so we could be all alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Trying to build something real, working fingertips to the bone
So much love's gone astray that it won't be coming home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouette beneath the moon
And she said, if satisfaction's guaranteed
Nothing else could come between the flight of a new love baby
Maybe we could be cool
Instead of sharing this here ship with the fools
You know that, right now, right now, right now, baby
Right now, right now, right now, baby
And she said
I'll give you the world if you want it
I'll give you the world if you need it baby

(See now) Catch a vision (a'ight) view me in the eyes of unequal
High above the plains but still remains equal
Livin on, no matter how fly there is no sequel
I am not a supreme being, freeing people
'Cause many minds are zombified, that's why they never rest
Fightin for the light and fightin' holes in their chest
Merely scavengers but no one who'll confess
But in time, they will all undress
Livin in the lost & found, trapped without sound
Dappin' ass a pound means it's way underground
No, calculating 'cause it's all round
Round like a figure, in old school calligra-phy
So figure that you don't wanna see
Far greater than the eye so you can fly Cali
Used to have a tax on teens now they got a tax on me
But that's if you can find me

Just because I'm tenant reason why they hit me with a rotten label
And use trickery to put my cards upon the table
So they can COPY, but they're UNABLE~!
They come SLOPPY, ill equipped to grip the sacred cables
Stretchin' out, that age old fable
How they're not really my friends
They can't wait to infiltrate and get me for my ends
It's been trend-in, in everything I do

Main reason why I, resist whack guys

So I set a new mark, transforming my styles
To reconcile with the present, peasant
Meaning unsliced conditions
Like the ninjas on my trail, you will fail in hell
The young male will prevail when all hell breaks

Men get worse I get 'em to make their mistakes
I stay low like a sheet of linoleum

(Slim Kid Tre')
You see the moon has a way with young idle minds
And idle time is the playground
Where old professions lay down
Like sweet sugar stays brown and on the mind
Gals whose whispers blow through tender lips like wind chimes
They tingle quiet ears with seductive words that I lust
And enjoy, for you fly boys to look and not touch
It ain't much but bet your dollars
Cause they holler
Without saying a thang
And she ain't saying no names
And I'm fond of an intent
Rock hard and she was skin flint
Working on a flame
It seemed like every move she made was some good ass game
I had to keep my focus tame
Cause it's a doggone shame
To see them endless
And friendless
Will us when the pride feels great
Cognac watered down to its last tender state
And emerald butterfly disappears from the skies
It seems the moon can't fight the sunrise

Feeling high, on the emerald butterfly (repeat 4X)
(Slim Kid Tre')
I was the mack of all times blowing their minds
In a world of fantasies when I'm casting my line
They would bite the bait and I would keep my ship sailing
On my crusading others would be out wading
In the water (water), more enticing than the farmer's daughter
As the imagination makes you wetter than her order
Though sweated her so tough , so rough out here
See you can't jump into the picture unless you chose to lose an ear
More nocturnal than the night itself the mystery's clear
Smears of venom all up on your denim smooth as cashmere
Steer in thoughts of feather beds and lightheadedness
Abyss it gets deeper (you know) so be a light sleeper (sleeper)
The grief is like autumn rain (autumn) washing your needs away
Now all this gold is what I need to say about glitter...

Uh, little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
Oh, how I tossed that ass up
Like a mission in the woods, Woody Woodpecker would
If he could, but I didn't wanna pass it up
To the next man, had my Walkman bumpin'
On the fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a killer thriller, driller tiller, out with the Miller brew
Fill her up, took it 'til the damn Dutch puked
Luke Skywalker ain't a sweet talker, so I got ill
With my lightsaber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst
The night felt good but the day got worse
I thought I was alone, Slim Tre the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school saying, "Ooh," and I'm busted for real

I'm so slick that they need to call me, "Grease"

Imani and your mom, sittin' in a tree
K-I-S-S (I-N-G)
Yo, first comes the tongue, and then comes the she
My homey's M-O-M, what? (M-I-E)
Yo, and to think to day one
In my eyes, I show fear
'Cause I stepped into his house
His mom's grinnin' ear-to-ear
Gigglin' and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin' me up for the kill
"Oh, what the hell," is what I said to myself
So that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch
And wish Greg would please hurry, what? (Up)
She offered me a cup of Ripple
Broke out the titty, squeezed her nipples
Said, "Suck it if you like, but please don't bite it"
I had an urge to say, "Fuck it," but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say, "Alakazam, carpet now"
I took this old bitch in the doggie style
Greg walked in the room, that nigga cold had a fit, yo
But all this numbskull could say was, "Oh, shit"
(What's the matter, mama?)
Oh, shit, oh, shit

Oh, shit, oh, shit

One fine summertime, Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple Samurai Suzuki
Dookie braids was the aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope
Man, real dope, on the real
Well anyway, I went, "Toot-toot"
She said, "Hey, beep, beep"
The next day, rolled down to the beach
Tuesday, me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty
Suck-suck-suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (Why?)
'Cause every time I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like, "Quit, hehe"
Bitch was frontin', but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden, after someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me, "Oh, please, God, no"
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go
Shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh, shit, oh, shit

Yo, Fatlip, man
Yo, man, they tryna run a power move on us, man
Yo, man
You got to tell the suckers what's up, boy
Yeah, haha

I got a letter from the DMV the other day
I opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They tried to tell me that my license was suspended
I got offended for a minute, then pretended
That I never even got the damn letter
It's nine o'clock on the dot, so I think I'd better
Scoot off to school, 'cause in class, there's a test
I gotta dress fast, grab my glasses and my vest
Oh damn, as hardheaded as I am
Hopped in my hooptie ride, pumped up the jam
Put it in reverse, into first, then dispersed and
From that very moment on, my day got worse

As I was standing in the street, I suddenly seen the smoke
I know that Derrick's on his way, I ran to get my coat
And a bag from the room, it took a minute, boom
Hopped into the car, we drove away in a zoom
I assume doom as we were drivin' on the gravel
At any given minute, we could have a shortened travel
So I ramble about my life, 'cause that's in shambles
Shoulda took the bus
I busted out some sandals or some old Nikes
I wish we had some good bikes
We need to exercise, maybe we could take a hike
And you could give Sheri back those car keys
Because everywhere I walk, I would not have to say please

Away to our destination
No license, no insurance, not even registration
Tags on the plate say December '82
Car's so dirty it looks gray (Gray), but it's really blue (Blue)
Who would think we're up to good?
Four Black niggas drivin' through the neighborhood
In hats and glasses, makin' funny passes
Like drivin' slowly, playin' low-key for asses
Knowin' damn well one-time will harass us
And all the while (While), we see girls jog (Jog)
Sheri's little car is pourin' out smog
Then we made a right and I spotted one in tights, ooh (Yo, baby, what's up? Pull over)

Do you live with your homeboys?
Yeah, I live with my homeboys
That's where you're takin' me, to your house where your homeboys are?
I mean, but they're not home
You ain't got your own crib?
Naw I ain't got
(5-0, man, 5-0)
Lights, action, without the camera
Sirens and high beams, two to a tee
The blue coat billy goats are crowdin' up my rear view
Hot on the tail of an innocent being
My heartbeat is racin' at a pace so fast
I'm wishin' that the coppers would get off my ass
My tail, can't go to jail 'cause it's wack
What would happen to my girl and my record contract?
Yo, fellas (What?), take off the baseball caps
Word up, I heard that the nerves get tapped
And throw on the glasses and give up the tees
Oh, please don't pull me over, officer, please

I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get
Cause all I got was upset
When niggas used to be like
("What's up, fool?! Nigga, what's up?!")
And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all, I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face
Down the hall, I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering, "Why is everybody always pickin' on me?"
I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared
To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95, I must survive as a man on my own
Fuck around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown
I'm not tryin' to show, no macho is shown
But when it's on, when it's on, then it's on

There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta handle shit up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please, they got problems of their own
Down for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven
Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back up in high school, I played it cool
Just so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless colored figure and
As a victim I invented low-key
Till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it, I let the bullshit blow in the breeze
In other words, just debris

Can't keep running away

It's 1995
And now that I'm older, stress weighs on my shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but I told y'all
Until the day that I die I still
Will be a soldier and that's all I told ya
And that's all I showed ya
And that's all I sold ya
And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity
Can it be (that I'm a celebrity
Who's on the brink of insanity?)
Now don't be wishin' of switchin' any positions with me (me)
Cause when you in my position, it ain't never easy
To do any type of maintainin'
Cause all this gamin' and famin' from entertainin'
Is hella strainin' (to the brain and)
But I can't keep runnin' I just gotta keep keen and cunnin'

Can't keep running away

You might not recognize who you're seeing
Most of your life I was invisible but physical
Seeing all your good days and days unliveable
I had a writable upon a steel water mask
Do you witness me like the grades of your past
Far through troubles too hard for your ass
Shout at egos entertain the stain glass
Now you see real clear real fast
Gotta catch up to a world that keep spinning
Tryna set my gears on non sinning
One true step is the beginning before the ending
There's no pretending for the winners now
Hold it up, see I be like all up in the shit and never folded up
See this one's from the heart
See you gotta play your cards right before you even start. It go...

From the soul. That's what it's all about

For me to blow up as I throw up the West coast
W you in trouble fool
If you fuck around with the lyrical imperial
Like miracle with on your sandwich
Yes I add flavor like Jeru, yo I do damage
That is some shit I kicked off the top
But I flipped the phat flows and I will not stop or won't quit

From the boroughs of Altadina, that's right between the
Mountains in Pasadena, that's my arena
I call it home, I had no need to chrome
I'm trying to get my shit tight so I stayed to my own
Then I met negativity. The kids we held ants
But we had the real plan
I had to let it go just like my man Teddy
I chose athletics and try to hit my books heavy
To coexist in this colonialist society
Discovering scenes that be live shitty and bribery
Plus killing is savagery swallows up the average G
Back in inner tension that is the invention of stress
And seems to be it's best kept secret
But it can't keep Brown down cause I'm not weak kid
And check it out, check it out
From the soul. That's what it's all about
Heart and soul. Let your spirit out
Take control. Everything about you
Will lets go. That's without a doubt

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Only fools think slow and whack niggas can't flow
So I step to the mic tight hype with a tight blunt in
My mind again bonding find the hype line
And I'm able to hold the cables able but I
First meditate so I can elevate
Those that perpetrate and try to penetrate
And try to infiltrate but I see em
And when I bomb em, I wouldn't wanna be em
Yeah, yeah. You know what time is it
Pharcyde is the crew and we running shit, ripping shit
Like a piece of paper
And you know that money making is the caper

From the soul. That's what it's all about

I want some respect, 'spect
I want some leathers and a coupe and a house full of loot
That'll make ya just gotta get a scoop2Embed
Now in my younger days, I used to sport a shag
When I went to school, I carried lunch in a bag
With a apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name, then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday, but still, I had to let her pass
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pass—

When I dream of fairytales, I think of me and Shelly
See, she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga, but
All I could do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by

Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me, "Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop"
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass, I proved to be a better man
She keeps on passin' me by (Passing me by)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me—

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
"My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me, but I know you
Very well, now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man, then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you"
Then I signed "Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, P.S. Love Me Tender"
The letter came back three days later "Return to Sender", damn
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pass—
Nevertheless, I'll say it again (Passing me by)
Nevertheless, I'll say it again
Nevertheless—
Nevertheless—
Nevertheless, I'll say it again

She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)52Embed
