5 ContributorsShe Said Stop Lyrics
I’ve been posted on the corner
From New York to California
She said stop, but I don’t wanna
She said stop, but I ain’t gonna
I just got to keep on hustlin’
I just got to keep on movin’
She said stop, but I don’t wanna
She said stop, but I ain’t gonna
She said stop, oh, baby don’t stop, don’t stop
Uh-uh uh-uh, baby don’t stop
She said stop, oh, baby don’t stop, don’t stop
Uh-uh uh-uh, baby don’t stop
She said stop, oh, baby don’t stop, don’t stop
Uh-uh uh-uh, baby don’t stop
She said stop, oh, baby don’t stop, don’t stop
Uh-uh uh-uh, baby don’t stop

Caramel skin tone, C’s on them lenses
Nails with the French-tip, she is the business
California kingpin, she can be my princess
Riddin’ with a young loc’, dippin’ through them trenches
My rap sheet, full of felony offenses
I feel her energy, she’s sendin’ me them glimpses
She only messin’ with them ballers and them Benz’s
Her taste is expensive, every day’s Christmas
You wanna taste, gotta treat
And thou’ll never trick, so we’ll never be
That’s what they all say, but their games so weak
Little momma want a real young nigga like me
Couple hundred out the deal, but I’m still OT
Tryin’ get a better ticket on the key, on me
Little momma wanna nigga like me
Tryin’ take me out the streets, but it just won’t be
You might also like
I’ve been posted on the corner
From New York to California
She said stop, but I don’t wanna
She said stop, but I ain’t gonna
I just got to keep on hustlin’
I just got to keep on movin’
She said stop, but I don’t wanna
She said stop, but I ain’t gonna
She said stop, oh, baby don’t stop, don’t stop
Uh-uh uh-uh, baby don’t stop
She said stop, oh, baby don’t stop, don’t stop
Uh-uh uh-uh, baby don’t stop
She said stop, oh, baby don’t stop, don’t stop
Uh-uh uh-uh, baby don’t stop
She said stop, oh, baby don’t stop, don’t stop
Uh-uh uh-uh, baby don’t stop

Been livin’ like this, gotta make my own way
Kill ‘em with the white bitch, you can call me O.J
Pop red tops off, you can call it rose
Only after dark, she’ll never get the whole day
Nah, it’s fast money over slow cake
I get paid, check traps in your state
Clear baggie, white powder, snowflakes
I can’t stop, freight train, no breaks
She’s so hot she make lanes, blow safes
I’m so block I sell ‘cane with no case
I got spots, make drops, rotate
And when she ride passenger side it’s like a showcase
You wanna taste, gotta treat
And thou’ll never trick, so we’ll never be
That’s what they all say, but their games so weak
Little momma want a real young nigga like me
