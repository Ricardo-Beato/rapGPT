8 Contributors1 Time Lyrics
Yeah, greatest show on Earth, baby
Yeah, yo, ah
What's up?
You are now witnessin’ (Yeah) street knowledge (Yeah)
Hustler's ambition (Sup?)
Determination
Adversity (You know what it is)
All of the a-motherfuckin'-bove, nigga
Yeah
Nigga, put your hands in the air for Snow one time
Let’s go

You niggas put your hands in the air one time (One time)
You niggas put them bands in the air one time (One time)
Just know your boy was ridin' dirty, dodgin' one time (One time)
So, sit back and let me tell you 'bout that one time (One time)
You bitches put your hands in the air one time (One time)
You bitches put them bands in the air one time (One time)
Just know your boy was ridin' dirty, dodgin' one time (One time)
So, sit back and let me tell you 'bout that one time (One time)

You ever seen a narco in the booth? (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm talkin’ ’bout thirty-six O's, nigga, white as your tooth (Ayy)
Desert Eagle, yeah, it look like a flute
On God, nigga, so many chickens, had to get me a coop (Ha ha)
Break it down just like a masseuse (’Seuse)
Standin' at this all-gas stove lookin' like I'm stirrin’ some soup (Damn)
That Mini-14, that uzi money (Money)
When that nina don't jump back right, that mean I'm losin' money (Yeah)
I can whip that yayo fast or slow, wash all the pots in the sink
Put up the soda, weight them bags and go (Ha ha)
Check the tempo, yeah, I be 'trollin' the flow
Here they come with them badges and them vests and they gon' kick in the door (Woot, woot, woot)
Got to find a spot to hide the money
The one thing I ain't never seen is a nigga tired of money (Nah)
Tiger Woods with the fork, I'm a pro (Pro)
Somebody call the Cookin' Network up, I wanna pitch 'em my show (Let's go)
You might also like
You niggas put your hands in the air one time (One time)
You niggas put them bands in the air one time (One time)
Just know your boy was ridin' dirty, dodgin' one time (One time)
So, sit back and let me tell you 'bout that one time (One time)
You bitches put your hands in the air one time (One time)
You bitches put them bands in the air one time (One time)
Just know your boy was ridin' dirty, dodgin' one time (One time)
So, sit back and let me tell you 'bout that one time (One time)

They call me S-N-O (S-N-O), that's short for Snow (Snow)
I wave that four (Four), I hit that blow (Hit that blow)
Watch 'em freeze like ice (Ice), yeah, it changed my life (My life)
The shit came back white (White), had to whip that twice (Twice)
Throw it back in the pot while I'm heatin' the stove
State Patrol on the highway, that's a fork in the road (Fork in the road)
Yellow box on the counter, got a fork and a pot (Fork and a pot)
Touch down, hit the town, hit the block with a block (Block)
Them nerds workin' your nerves while you workin' them halves
First I start it with science, then I end it with math (End it with math)
Got the weight on the dresser, I'm the Nutty Professor (Nutty Professor)
Twenty-four like they coke, yeah, I got that Vanessa
Turn a four to a nine, they were callin' him Magic (Magic)
If the spot got a line, neighbors callin' it traffic (Yeah)
It's that Thug Motivation, it's that no hesitation (Ayy)
Time to break out the scales, guess you off on vacation (Let's go)
You niggas put your hands in the air one time (One time)
You niggas put them bands in the air one time (One time)
Just know your boy was ridin' dirty, dodgin' one time (One time)
So, sit back and let me tell you 'bout that one time (One time)
You bitches put your hands in the air one time (One time)
You bitches put them bands in the air one time (One time)
Just know your boy was ridin' dirty, dodgin' one time (One time)
So, sit back and let me tell you 'bout that one time (One time)1Embed
