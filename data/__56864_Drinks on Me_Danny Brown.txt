19 ContributorsDrinks on Me Lyrics
You got your niece to babysit ya baby
Toes looking right cause early you got a pedi
You ain't got a man but you got a baby daddy
Go out ya way to get drunk at a party every Saturday
But who am I to judge, baby? Want another drink?
Tonight give me your brain, you ain't gotta think
Just let yourself go, tomorrow blame the alcohol
You ain't got a job, it ain't like you got a class tomorrow
Find you a purse to borrow, beats is like your friends
Start being in thoughts cause the party never ends
I.D. say 22, shop at Forever 21
Best friend 30, she's forever 21
Going down the same path, take another sip
Pour another glass, take another hit
I tell you that you're beautiful, your pops never did
Probably why it ain't a pop around for none of your kids
Sorry for putting out ya biz
But right now I can't stop looking at them tits
And grabbing on that ass, filling up the glass
Get you drunk and fuck you, that's a part of my task
And she really helping, being a real sport about it
Full cup of Goose, pinch of cran and she allowed it
20 minutes later, man, she really all about it
20 minutes later, man, she took a nigga out, kid, drinks on me
You might also like
Pass the designated driver the keys
And don't worry y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Bring your I.D. hanging with me
It's on my tab y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Hennessey and Grand Cru for me
I take a sip and say free Max B, so have a drink with me
So don't worry y'all, 'bout no fees
I said I got it y'all, drinks on me, so have a drink with me

Say my auntie sort of like an alcoholic
Been drinking since the teens, shitting blood in the toilet
Started real young, nigga pushed the bottle on her
Drunk, fully clothed in tubs, I cut showers on her
But I still love her and I live life for her
She ask me for a dollar, I'm gon' give it to her
Stay drinking on the brew, keep a can in her hand
Tied grocery bag full of keystone cans
Alcoholism has poisoned our city
Liquor store on every corner ain't like that in other cities
So you have a drink, take a hit and pass that
Give a buck to a wino help him buy crack
Dwell on the past, looking towards tomorrow
Wish I could lend my pain, let you borrow my sorrow
Live where lil' niggas wanna be Chris Partlow
Say fuck the lotto, buck's on a bottle, drinks on me
