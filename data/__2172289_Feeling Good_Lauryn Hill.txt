6 ContributorsFeeling Good Lyrics
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean
Don't ya know
Butterflies having fun,, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And this hold world is a new world
And a bold world for me
You might also like
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of a pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine and I know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
I'm feeling good2Embed
