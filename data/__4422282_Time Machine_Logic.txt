I built a time machine for you
But you always die, no matter what I do
Every time I go back, I always seem to fail
And the Angel of Death always prevails

I see your face everywhere I go
I watch your blood melt through the snow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on

I built a time machine for you
But you always die, no matter what I do
Every time I go back, I always seem to fail
And the Angel of Death always prevails

I see your face everywhere I go
I watch your blood melt through the snow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on

I've seen you die a thousand times
The moment it happens is burned in my mind
But I know I'm gonna save you this time
I'll meet you in the clouds if I don't this time
You might also like
I see your face everywhere I go
I watch your blood melt through the snow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on7Embed
