13 ContributorsU.P.A. (Outro) Lyrics
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to our annual recital here at the U.P.A., Urban Pianist Association. Here is the most talented student in my class, Aubrey Drake Graham. It has taken a long time for him to get to this point. Do not get me wrong, he’s not perfect, but he has come a long way since my meeting with his mother. He has made improvement! So Aubrey, show these people what you got man!

Put the Jamie Foxx on them! I won’t be able to see you, but I will be able to hear you from outside, so, I’ll eat my Greek salad and drink that Grey Goose you gave me, mmmm! Anyways, good luck! Hey! Don’t mess up, okay? My ass is on the line!


Hey! What did I tell you about playing bad notes huh?! You’re a Failure! Just leave and take your damn Grey Goose with you!You might also likeEmbed
