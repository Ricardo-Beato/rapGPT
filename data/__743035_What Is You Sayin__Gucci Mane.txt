6 ContributorsWhat Is You Sayinâ€™ Lyrics
Me and you bitch get along
What is you saying, homes?
You and money don't get along
What is you saying, homes?
I'm on the road, always gone
Where is you staying, homes?
You niggas macho, ain't get cash
What is you saying, homes?

Wrestling with the working figure for the dopeman
Hell yeah, Gucci Mane applaud, but used to be the dopeman
I had to search them niggas down, 'fore the money change hands
If you thinking of jacking Gucci, you fuckers better change plans
My buddy say he found God and that he's a changed man
I whipped the dope so hard it jumped to thirty-eight grams
You shopping with the middle-man, went through like thirty-eight hands
I got a thirty-eight special so I'm aiming at heads

Me and you bitch get along
What is you saying, homes?
You and money don't get along
What is you saying, homes?
I'm on the road, always gone
Where is you staying, homes?
You n* macho, ain't get cash
What is you saying, homes?
You might also like
Nighttime in the hood, but my wrist glowing
I got your auntie smoke that pipe, yeah she been blowing
And you ain't gotta call,  where your bitch going
Drop 'rari in the hood, got the tits showing
She kick it with me the long way, yeah she feel going
Stupid racks in the wall, yeah they Mildewing
She say that you can't pay the bills, let the bitch do it
And even you can get some money, it ain't shit to it

Me and you bitch get along
What is you saying, homes?
You and money don't get along
What is you saying, homes?
I'm on the road, always gone
Where is you staying, homes?
You n* macho, ain't get cash
What is you saying, homes?

Tell me what you saying, homes
Then play it right, you played it wrong
Got a badass bitch that stayed at home
And you're home alone and on your own
Motherfuck you. Have a destitution, pump your list and call my phone
R.I.P to Pimp C, diss me and you gonna smell my cologne
Ain't no word 'bout casualties
Ain't no dead without tragedies
You standing by the block with me
But your bitch still wanna talk with me
I know the feds wanna shackle me
Dopeboys in my properties
Put a hundred Gs in your bitch house
But don't spend that shit without asking me
Me and you bitch get along
What is you saying, homes?
You and money don't get along
What is you saying, homes?
I'm on the road, always gone
Where is you staying, homes?
You n* macho, ain't get cash
What is you saying, homes?1Embed
