The girls ask me for that Willie D, that's how I know they feelin' me
It's simple, see, the pimpin' be what got these bitches clipped to me
You may be at the game, I guarantee you we in different seats
I seen you in the nosebleeds, but where I'm at, that isn't cheap
In the Benz, in a Jeep, make a million in a week
Takin' off her clothes 'fore I begin to speak like, "Gimme cheeks"
Been to London, been to France, go there if you get the chance
Been to Amsterdam, hit the club, hell no, I didn't dance
Rolled around a little, smoked the weed, seen the red lights
Ain't fuck a prostitute but the head nice, get right
From here on to the next life, relax and sip that Red Stripe
Way I spend this money, you would think I had a ex-wife
Bitches love the lead pipe, the 'Burgh, word to Ken Rice
New place every day, what I would give to just have ten nights
Yeah, right, 'bout to drop an album, hope to blow your mind
Tryna reach a level where no music is put over mine

Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long (How about another one?)
Or am I wrong?

Hey
It's young Macintosh, tell you 'bout that sabotage
Travelin' through Germany, word to David Hasselhoff
Back up off me, kill 'em softly, bitches like to fuck 'em doggy
Prolly off some molly, got me turnin' into polygons
On and on, DJ's puttin' on my song
People say I talk too long, killin' every single track the God is on
They cheerin' with their pom-poms, buyin' what I got on
Straight gold, find me fuckin' Silver with my Long John
Tom Tom, direct me to that money please
Square sponge, fuckin' dumb, yeah, your grades is under C
And I know, "In God we trust," but how much do they trust in me?
Enough to be a fuckin' beast on beats, yeah
Shit is so disgustingly amazin', bitches out the playpen
You fuck your hand, askin', "How much money can I fit into this rubberband?"
Hustlin', throw your ass right inside a rubbish can
Excuse my French, that's just how I'd talk if I was Russell Brand
Know that I'm the fuckin' man, play my shit for three days
"All I make is hits, call me T-Pain!"
Sicker than if she gave me AIDS, plus some teeth decay
Then she stole my condom, try to auction it on eBay
Talk a little shit, man, probably thought he dissed me
Bitch, please, I just ate out Monica Lewinsky
Yeah, I taught her 'bout some slaughter, had her cryin' 'bout her father
Then I busted in her face while she told me, "It's an honor"
Bob O'Connor, we just politickin', finger-lickin' on my chicken
Got a way with words, words, words, word to Charles Dickens
I wrote this on the shitter usin' toilet paper
Then put your head inside the waters, enjoy the flavor, heh
Yeah, bitch
Nah, Jerm, don't cut me off, man
Fuck you
Ha-ha

Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up 'cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?
