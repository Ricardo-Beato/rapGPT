(DY Krazy)
Starin' at the candle
Feel the pain on me, nigga, it don't matter
Get my currency exchanged, got my bands up

I'm a ty-tycoon, that's why they hate me (Wheezy outta here)
'Til they throw the sheets on me, I'm goin' crazy
Got Balencis on my feet, they can't take me
I know I ain't gon' be deceased 'til I'm like eighty
I been gettin' so damn geeked, I been prayin'
I been chinchilla sheet wherever I'm stayin'
Took that Draco on the PJ, I ain't playin'
I ain't goin', no, no, streets dangerous

Ain't got Actavis, so fuck it, I had to red it
I sent hitters from everywhere, they had to dead it
You know my niggas, they bangin' the same color spaghetti
I got my transport up and I got my Getty
I'm gettin' her passport stamped, we goin' steady
They tried to cut a nigga throat off with a machete
I know my lil' brother gon' kick a door and let that lead hit
I'm not an imposer, so I'm tryna find an exit
They know it's a thousand cutters hittin' off if they come for me
Uno gang, twenty-seven, they gon' gun for me
ABK gon' broad day you and get it done for me
I'm a big dawg, they a lil' son to me
You might also like
I'm a ty-tycoon, that's why they hate me
'Til they throw the sheets on me, I'm goin' crazy
Got Balencis on my feet, they can't take me
I know I ain't gon' be deceased 'til I'm like eighty
I been gettin' so damn geeked, I been prayin'
I been chinchilla sheet wherever I'm stayin'
Took that Draco on the PJ, I ain't playin'
I ain't goin', no, no, streets dangerous

Fully auto on the seat, ain't lettin' you take it
I ain't going, no, no, I'ma spray it
Let my dogs off the leash, you gon' hate it
Twin choppers on me, they my favorite, yeah, yeah
Catch me rollin' in the Ghost, Patrick Swayze
Travelin' all across the coast for this gravy
Buyin' gold by the pound, I upgraded
I came from Lil Mexico, a nigga made it
Posted up outside the store, I'm the greatest
If you can make it out the bricks, that's amazing
I got my gang from out the 6, ain't no tradin'
You know the side where it's two guns blazin'

I'm a ty-tycoon, that's why they hate me (I'm a ty-tycoon)
'Til they throw the sheets on me, I'm goin' crazy ('Til they throw the sheets on me)
Got Balencis on my feet, they can't take me (Gotta keep Balencis on me)
I know I ain't gon' be deceased 'til I'm like eighty (Yeah, I ain't gon' be deceased, no)
I been gettin' so damn geeked, I been prayin' (Yeah, I'm geeked, man, I'm geeked up)
I been chinchilla sheet wherever I'm stayin' (Got my chinchilla sheets up)
Took that Draco on the PJ, I ain't playin' (Took the Draco on the P, brrt)
I ain't goin', no, no, streets dangerous (I ain't goin', no, no, streets dangerous)
Yeah
I ain't goin', no, no
I ain't goin', no, no, streets dangerous (Trap)
I ain't goin', no, no (Yeah, what you do?)
I chinchilla'd all my sheets wherever I'm stayin' (I chinchilla'd all my sheets)
I been gettin' so fuckin' geeked, I been prayin' (I been gettin' so fuckin' geeked)
Had that Draco on the PJ, I ain't playin' (Took the Draco on the PJ)
I ain't goin', no, no, streets dangerous (I ain't goin', I ain't goin')

Starin' at the candle
Feel the pain on me, nigga, it don't matter
Get my currency exchanged, got my bands up7Embed
