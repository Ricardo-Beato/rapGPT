33 ContributorsG’d Up Lyrics
Allah Math, dig it

My block is G'd up, the cops is racist
Staircases is peed up, haters get beat up
Woman are getting eat up
Look at this paper don't need much
But still need a calculator to keep up
Je-sus; I'm doing me, B.I.G
Hit Lil Cease up after I hit this tree up
Me, I get my cheese up
Puff the buddha, I get my Chi up
My team in the building until the lease up
Look, you think this method ain't pro-lific then pro-hibit
See, I'm the witted but like my daddy, no different
A go-getter, I go get it, now go figure
Without no figures, no gold cards, no gold diggers
To quote Jigga, I goes hard, I blow Swishers
I blow that trigger, your whole squad can go wit'cha
Ay, Dio mío, I'm a hell of a flow spitter
You ain't my people, I don't care if you know RZA
'Cause at the end of the day
I'm a problem, boy, stay out of my way
Now if you see me in the streets, you better give me my space
And if I beat you to the punch, I punch you dead in your face

Murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out
The Corleone connection in all selection
Murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out
The Corleone connection in all selection
Murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out
The Corleone connection in all selection
Take over, quick fast, violate, slap shit
And every borough, state, town, prison, map shit

Drink sippin', no slippin', weed, women
No kidding, big business, tops missing
Ice glisten, clear vision, keep wishin'
Welcome to the big boy life
Bottle popping, no stopping, haters watching
Speaker knocking, shorty hoppin', rollie copin'
Wig rockin', big talking, cash dropping
Welcome to the big boy life - yeah

Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah
We known to do this
The flow is losing, it's so abusive
Was born a Christian but Joe the truth is that dough is Jewish
I over do this, fuck a moderation
Homie we focused, my camp Auschwitz with the concentration
Meth-Tical, R-Dash, Allah Math
Step in my shoes and leave footprints in God's path
These surfaces try to divert us away from a higher purpose
I look emcees in their eyes, you looking kind of nervous
But we knowing the mean, the leader's showing ya
King of kings, Haile Selassie, Ethiopia
Blunt condition chronic and I don't mean that pneumonia
So shorty you and your friend
I'm bout to leave with the both of ya
She tell me that she need me
They always come right back
Bitches get repo'd quicker than Tyga's Lamborghini
We eating lobster and shrimp
Rappers is Ramadan
Too raw, I shouldn't spit without a condom on
The type of rookie that's respected by the veterans
'Cause dog I ain't a rookie, I'm a motherfucking veteran
Light up the medicine, just know you've been warned
'Cause when the killer bees starting to swarm, you know it's on
Murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out
The Corleone connection in all selection
Murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out
The Corleone connection in all selection
Murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out
The Corleone connection in all selection
Take over, quick fast, violate, slap shit
And every borough, state, town, prison, map shit

Drink sippin', no slippin', weed, women
No kidding, big business, tops missing
Ice glisten, clear vision, keep wishin'
Welcome to the big boy life
Bottle popping, no stopping, haters watching
Speaker knocking, shorty hoppin', rollie copin'
Wig rockin', big talking, cash dropping
Welcome to the big boy life - yeah4Embed
