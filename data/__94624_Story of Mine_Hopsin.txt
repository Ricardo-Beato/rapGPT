32 ContributorsStory of Mine Lyrics
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (alright)

Mommy never had shit, neither did pop
And that's exactly the reason that he beat her a lot
So shit, as a kid I had to be a cheater and rob
Dealing with all of the consequences of me getting caught
Life appeared to be cool when I was young 'cause I ain't notice things
Rent was paid every month with no problems so it seems
And as I got older I would catch on to things
Then I start to notice that shit ain't the way it's 'posed to be
Come to find out weâ€™ve been up in a rut
My mom feeling like she got a knife stuck in the gut
And dad tripping out for no reason, cussin' and stuff
I'm trying hard, sucking it up like, "Fuck it, it's us"
And Christmas in our household was not that popular
'Cause all I ever received was socks and boxers
My friend got a Power Rangers toy and a Mega-Zoid
It was official, mark it on our fucking family record: poor

Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (alright)

When I was 17 my dad moved out
He refused to try and help us get a brand new house
So that just left me, my mom and my sister
And it was up to me to be the man to polish our future
We was slowly falling apart
I felt the pain all in my heart
When my mom would go and crawl in the dark
And cry her lungs out 'cause she knew that our good times is up now
I ain't know how to deal with none of it, I was strung out
Finally my 18th birthday hit
I would've left, but I had to help her pay rent
My homies got their own place, they living very nice
Sipping on some Bacardi and throwing parties every night
They mom buying cars, new 3-50 Z's
While my mom's in debt, at least 50 G's
That means I got to work harder just to get by
'Cause if I don't we'll be struggling for the rest of our life, fuck

Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (alright)

God I hate to cuss to you, but I hate my fucking life
Nothing's right, it's cold in my world, it's never summer time
Is it a test? Giving me this mediocre lifestyle
If I'ma get it then what needs to happen right now
I'm one week away from jumping off a cliff
Or putting heat up to my head, and then dumping off a clip
I know you think I'm just lying, 'cause last time
I stood next to a cliff side, I bitched out but I'ma do it this time
Man forget it, we both know I'm not
I just say that stupid shit because I'm so low on guap
But for real though, God man you've got to help me out
'Cause I know the road I'm rolling on is not a healthy route
From now back to the day I was a little kid
Shit ain't even brighten up a little bit
Now wouldn't you be just a little pissed if this was you
Yeah I'm cursed and it's the truth
Looks like I'ma have to resort to violence to get the loot
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
Thank you for listening to my story (alright)2Embed
