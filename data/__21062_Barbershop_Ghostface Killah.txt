Hey yo man, what's the deal fam (yo yo)

You lucky you cool, I'mma let it ride
Slide, you played me so you can't get paid
How you gon' fuck up a don and cold dog his fade?
I look like UTFO one of them dudes from back in the days
The educated clapper is housin' your coconut spray
Barbershop niggas, always wind up fuckin around
One minute you hot, next minute you not
Remind me of the New York Knicks with they jumpshots
Ox, whack as hell, my ratchet spell
Fuck up again you'll have a funny smell
All Reneece is doin straight nails
Puttin in bangs for bitches
Hundred dollar weaves, some different strains of horsehair
Yo Tone put the gun away, the cops is here
(I want everybody down! I wanna see ID, and I don't wanna nobody sayin nothin)
(I put one of you moolies back, I'm telling you right now)
(I will shoot any one of you guys, I'm telling you)
(Don't hit the exit) {*man running and breathing hard*}1Embed
