46 ContributorsLamar Lyrics
Uh, I spit that R.O.C., nothing but crack, bitch
Get my cleats 'cause I'm running this rap shit
Y'all know me, this ain't nothing but practice
I'm running the streets and I'm running this rap shit
I got bars, OD, I been running this rap shit
I run this bitch like I'm Lamar Jackson, uh

Takeover, the breaks over
Hit yo' brakes 'cause the race over, I'm the case closer
Bust yo' whole fucking face open, that's a makeover
Lean make every soda grape soda, purple taste golden
Make me have my skaters skate over to your place soldier
You a play soldier, you a snakе, you a fake cobra
You ain't safe, have thе safe open, I need payola
On yo' knees, nigga where the keys? I'm like Beethoven
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, a pen to a test
I bring the night to his sunlight and zen to her stress
I bring the gun to a fist fight, the dick to her breast
She want the cum on her tongue like it's mint to her breath
This is grown man BI, R.I.P B.I
Nigga, you might be a CI, talkin' to the FBI
Big beast to the east-side, now she's on my G5
Fuck on her to some C5, cut on Funeral and she die
Your reach ain't long enough, yo' peeps ain't strong enough
Yo' beach ain't warm enough
You ain't been in the throne
'Cause the seat ain't warm enough
And nigga, I'm the only one
I got the crown on, I'm the goat and you the pony, son
Don't let me do it to him Dunie 'cause I overdo it
The choppa was too big for me, had to grow into it
His stylist split his wig for me if I told her do it
We hit his crib and broke into it, if it's smoke, we blew it
We don't believe you, you need more people
Ain't shit sweet, boy, you need more Equal
You ain't runnin' shit, boy, feed your Ezekiel
All my niggas rich, boy, clean no illegal
Don't let em gas you, like Tunechi reading Thrasher
He won't thrash you 'cause I'll be glad to split your apple, I had to
Stab you, chop you up in the bathroom so casual
Then drop you off in front of a chapel with candles
Detach you, body from soul
Anita Baker body and soul, come out of my soul
I made a way to the rockiest roads and highway patrol
Full speed ahead clean the bread from the sloppiest joes
I got it in the hot and the cold, the mud in the rain
I stomach the pain, got more bloods than the blood in my veins
I'm huntin' the game, you guys ain't fuckin with Wayne
Ask your vibe 'cause she fuckin' Lil Wayne, yeah
You might also like
Nigga, y'all know me, this ain't nothin' but practice
OG, I been sonnin' these bastards
Double R, no key, got a button for that shit
And if y'all don't see, then I'm comin' with graphics
Nigga, war no peace, and I'm comin' with caskets
Screamin' RIP to everyone in this rap shit
Nigga, y'all so sweet and I'm nothing but nasty
And I'm runnin' this rap shit, nigga, Lamar Jackson, No Ceilings

This is No Ceilings 3
That's right, Lil Wayne
And be ready for I Am Not A Human Being 3
The album coming 2021
