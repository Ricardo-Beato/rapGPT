46 ContributorsFields Lyrics
Money talk, only broke people listen
Ain't got a pot to piss in, can't afford to pay attention
These unfamiliar niggas be expectin' recognition
Respect the intellect, let me continue on the mission
I used to walk through alleys, paths with the field
You know, that one house where Kenneth 'nem use to live
Now it's just another shortcut to the store
The TV in the window drew the line of what was rich and poor
Mommy gave me food stamps and told me buy Wonder Bread
On the way, these niggas jumped me, left me with knots in my head
Went to school yesterday and had to leave early
'Cause niggas said they was gon' jump me at 3:30
All because I lived in the hood they had beef with
And I ain't never tell 'em, dog, I kept that shit a secret
I can't really trip, niggas looked out for me
Them same niggas played me ain't around to tell the story
I'm just a young nigga on the D.O.T
With my headphones on and a sack full of weed
Rhymes in my head, thought nobody wanted to hear 'em
So I had the fiends hittin' rocks like the Pilgrims

And where I lived
It was house, field, field
Field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field
And where I lived
It was house, field, field
Field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

That nigga much sicker
That's why he pop pills, sip lean, smoke Swishers
Yeah, I'm doing drugs thought I'd never ever try
That had my eyes dry, dog, I wish I could cry
I'm fuckin' bad foreign bitches while you in the hood
Smokin' on some dirt weed, smellin' like some firewood
Sittin' on porches of abandoned houses
Or sitting in the field on bed-bug-ridden couches
It's like they all forgot, man, nobody care about us
That why we always end up in the prison 'stead of college
Or livin' in the system, workin' kitchen for chump change
Lost in the streets, niggas playin' that gun game
Where nobody wins, just a bunch of mamas losing
Dead body in the field, nobody heard the shooting
We livin' in the streets where the options is limited
Because it's burnt buildings instead of jobs and businesses

And where I lived
It was house, field, field
Field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field
And where I lived
It was house, field, field
Field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field5Embed
