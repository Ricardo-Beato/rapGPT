1 ContributorSupper Lyrics
Ayy, damn this I'm on to yo' nigga named Carter
Like Savage, I slide her, I drip like a washer
My new bitch from Phoenix, give head like a beanie
Like Cena, can't see me, they praying to be me
But you can not be me, forever I'm Trendy
Shout out to , proud like a penny
You hate like you Ruckus, my gang is the toughest
Write ass for the culture, I look just like Usher

I'm on this beat with no undies, no socks
I'm stealin' yo' v-card, no Swiper the Fox
Clout is my mothеr so, I'ma go mother-fuck
I drop a song and they ask for another onе
'Cause of one, "Licc On MI Dingy" had hangtime
Now I got Ugly God all on my facetime
That is my brother like clearly I'm bouta blow
Stay in my room and fuck school, I don't wanna go
Only live once so I'm all on my stupid shit
'Cause of my lameness, I only make stupid hits
Stupid bitch, shout out my shorty and  bitch
Fuck wit' my girl and I might have to *bleep* bitch
Where the bitch, she the bitch, you the bitch *pew*
My name is Trendy, I'm coming for you
You might also like
Ayy, damn this I'm on to yo' nigga named Carter
Like Savage I slide her, I drip like a washer
My new bitch from Phoenix, give head like a beanie
Like Cena, can't see me, they praying to be me
But you can not be me, forever I'm Trendy
Shout out to , proud like a penny
You hate like you Ruckus, my gang is the toughest
Write ass for the culture, I look just like Usher

Bitch you a snack, I'ma eat you for supper (For supper)
I'm hittin' it raw, I'm not using no rubber (A rubber)
Orlando boys kill it, we stay in the suburbs
She calling me daddy, I fucked on her mother
Walk in the store, feel like All State, I'm covered
Got racks in my hands, gotta save it my brother

I gave you a feature, don't ask for another
I take off no rocket, I speak with a stutter (Stutter)
I speak with a stutter, I fucked on your mother (Mother)
Got blue on my jeans and the green in the cupboard (The cupboard)
Got blood on my hands, got yo' bitch on her period (Period)
Speaking too much, I don't wanna be hearing it (Hearing it)
Whippin' a beamer, I'm not even steering it (Skrrt)
Calling me whore and that's not even fearing me
I only want hundreds, I do not want fifties
I be fucking this bitches when I'm in my 60s (My 60s)
Ride or die, Ethan my nigga since middle school days we've been going gorillas (Going gorillas)
Got Louis my feet, got this Louis my pillow
Dog shit on my lawn, throw it right at your window (Window)
Sip on the Henny, this shit got me crazy
Ten minutes later, this shit got me lazy (Got me lazy)
Changing my style, I feel like DaBaby (Ahh, ahh)
Three in the morning, the weather so hazy
On my way over to take yo' lil' bitch (Bitch!)
Hop in the coupe with just me and a chick
Don't fuck with AP, this really my wrist
Lil' bitch, I ain't supreme and you niggas is shit
Anime bitches they all on my dick
And  where we at where's Chris
Water is Fiji (Fiji), this girl on my PP (PP)
He don't believe me, my diamonds are VV
If you want, you can come and see, see (See see)
Put your hands on it, you gon' bleed, bleed
Bitch you a snack, I'ma eat you for supper
I'm hittin' it raw, I'm not using no rubber
Orlando boys kill it, we stay in the suburbs
She calling me daddy, I fucked on her mother
Walk in the store, feel like Allstate, I'm covered
Got racks in my hands, gotta save it my brotherEmbed
