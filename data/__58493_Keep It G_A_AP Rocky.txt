I got the bag you can not stop me
You mad you spicy you taki
If thеy listen wit smirks then they oppy
Sеnd blows to your head like I’m rocky
I’m takin it all misses monopoly
If you speak on my name speak it properly
When I say it they love it they mockin me
An can’t help dat it shake cuz it’s wobbly
Big money lottery dats wat it gotta be
A.P on my wrist an red bottom me
An if u lookin for smoke den I gotta beem
And no I ain’t sleep but I gotta dream
Ima do it like Martin but I’m not a king
But I’m wearin da crown so bow dwn to da queen
Versace silk robe when I step on da scene
When it come to dat bag
Ain’t no comin between
Uh
You feel dat
Dat pressure up on yo neck
It’s dat pressure I eject
Without my foot up on ur neck
Uh wats next
A couple bands for da flex
Yea I come wit Nike like a check
Ha now ya lookin all upset
Pussy so wet he bought me a boat
He coped me da Bentley I threw him the throat
Awww shit now I’m doin da most
Ass is up let’s bump like a toast
Give a nigga threesome
Make a nigga recome
But never let a nigga slide faster den his visa
No I ain’t a thot and my name ain’t treasha
Keep speaking on me u gon be ghost no recon
