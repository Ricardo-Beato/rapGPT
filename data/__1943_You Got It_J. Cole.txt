67 ContributorsYou Got It Lyrics
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart

Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right, and girl you dead right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (You got it) you got it (You got it)
You got it (You got it) you got it (You got it, hey)

Hey, Cole World, real cold world
I watch you hit the floor and watch it drop it real low, girl
Last time I seen you, you was a lil old girl
Had a crush, now we grown and you still so thorough
Uh, clap for her, work it 'til you exhausted
I swear ain't nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass
Goddamn, your ex-man is a dumbass
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?
Was he stressing you? Wasn’t fucking you right?
Well, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
One man’s pain is another man’s pleasure
One damn thing you can’t change is the weather
But even if it rain, we get rained on together, huh
It’s whatever, you shine, I shine
I know you got a 9 to 5, I’ll be your 5 to 9
You might also like
Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right, and girl you dead right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (You got it) you got it (You got it)
You got it (You got it) you got it (You got it, hey)

May this song reach your heart
Uh, man, I could hear 'em saying
May this song reach your heart
Ayy, yeah

Yeah, go 'head and pop it like you do in the mirror
I’m picking through the crowd, tryna see a little clearer
High heel wearer, uh, hell of a body
First one to spot you and I ain't telling nobody
Nope, I’m peeking at your ass, winking at your ass
If I don't bag, I’ll be thinking 'bout your ass
For the whole week, no time for cold feet
She too bad to pass, so fine, I'm gon' speak
I tell her my name Jermaine, I’m tryna be lowkey
She tell me I got that flame, "Your rhymes are so deep"
Damn, girl thank you, shit, you so bad
Know your daddy wish he could still spank you, hol' up
'Fore these other niggas roll up and try and get ya
The ones that say they riders but never do ride with ya
I’m tryna vibe wit'cha so won't you throw me your phone number?
And let them lames get your old number
Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right, and girl you dead right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (You got it) you got it (You got it)
You got it (You got it) you got it (You got it, hey)

May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
Roc Nation, Wale, haha

Look, Cole World, still a cold world
And a couple y'all is cool but we a little more thorough, huh
Whole time, a little more girls
You know I spit that sick shit and there’s still no cure
Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer
Choking on them white boys make a Black Panther
Love my women with high heels and high standards
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat
I ain't superstitious, I make all these broads split my pole
Ha, you dig it, this shit ain't for beginners
I’m something like a fetus, see, I'm not quite kidding
And there's something you ain't seeing like I block y'all vision
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop
Hundred K in twenty-two hours
See, money talks, you muthafuckers is Boomhauer
No check back, in debt, yep
Loud in my J, y'all smoke that Gallaudet
Higher than I need to be, flyer 'cause I need to be
Love our conversation but it’s late right now, I need to beat, haha
One time for the Ville that Cole rep
Another time for the city of the slow death
I don't understand why these niggas so vexed
I don't need no chains with no cross to know I’m blessed
Hold up!
Ay, one time (One time) one time (One time)
Ay, throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right, and girl you dead right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (You got it) you got it (You got it)
You got it (You got it) you got it (You got it, hey)
