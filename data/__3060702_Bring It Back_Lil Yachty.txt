I just want you closer now
I just wanna breathe your air, grab your hair
I just wanna take you home and show you off
I know he's the one involved but I'm in charge

Bring it back
You need to bring it back
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
You need to bring it back
You've been gone for too long, it's time to come home
You've been gone for too long, it's time to come home
You need to bring it back
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
You've been gone for too long
Baby, you've been gone for too long
Baby, you've been gone for too long
Baby, you've been gone for too long
(You've been gone for too long)
You need to bring it back
(You've been gone for too long)

I know you happy where you are
But you were happier with me
All them times at the beach
All the sand in your toes
All your friends, hatin' hoes
They just mad 'cause we be goals
You might also like
(Please bring back your loving)
'Cause you've been gone for too long
You need to bring it back
You've been gone for too long
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
(Please bring back your loving)
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
(You've been gone for too long)
You need to bring it back
You've been gone for too long
(You need to bring it back)

Like somethin' was wrong with it
All night, would talk on the phone with it
All night, been thinkin' 'bout you and what
We gonna do when I get next to you
You know I been missin' your smell
I been missin' the way you raise hell
I been missin' the way your stories tell
I mean the way they're told
Your skin is so gold, I miss it
Oh, I miss it, I miss it, I miss it
Wait 'til I see you, watch how I kiss it
Kissin' it and squeeze it
I just wanna please it
We startin' out easy
But we takin' off
I need you to love me
Love me, love me so strong
Love me, love me so strong
(Baby, we gone)
You've been gone for too long
Baby, you've been gone for too long
(You've been gone for too long)
You need to bring it back
(You've been gone for too long)

I know you happy where you are
But you were happier with me
All them times at the beach
All the sand in your toes
All your friends, hatin' hoes
They just mad 'cause we be goals

(Please bring back your loving)
'Cause you've been gone for too long
You need to bring it back
You've been gone for too long
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
(Please bring back your loving)
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
(You've been gone for too long)
You need to bring it back
You've been gone for too long
(You need to bring it back)
(Please bring back your loving)
You've been gone for too long
You need to bring it back
You've been gone for too long
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
(Please bring back your loving)
You need to bring it back to my life, girl
(You've been gone for too long)
You need to bring it back
You've been gone for too long
(You need to bring it back)
Bring it back to me now
Bring it back to me now
Bring it back to me
Bring it back to me now
Bring it back to me now
Bring it back to me now
Bring it back to me now
Now, now, now, now

You've been gone for too long
Please bring back your loving
