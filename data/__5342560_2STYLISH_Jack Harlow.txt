Too stylish
She too fly
Make me lose balance
Back it up, like we taking over for the '99
And the 2000's
The city that's mine
I need a new challenge
I can't tell if you 'bout it

I doubt it
Baddies at the club and they got ya boy surrounded
She want me to pound it
Said she want my kids but they grounded
I been staying focused, got me celibate
I could be selling dick
Now I'm in my element
Y'all boys' irrelevant
Me and Jenius, we got hella hits
I don't know what jealous is
'Cause I ain't never felt the shit
Feeling like myself again
Feeling like the man
I got some stories I can tell my kids
You got some stories you can tell your friends
About my grace and my elegance
You might also like
Too stylish
She too fly
Make me lose balance
Back it up, like we taking over for the '99
And the 2000's
The city that's mine
I need a new challenge
I can't tell if you 'bout it

She on that Smirnoff Ice
Get right to it, we don't turn off lights
She done got some money now she wear Off White
Off of the white, got her turnt all night
All right (All right)
Them boys said on sight, it's all lies, yeah
Big dog to these small fries, yeah
Tens with me, you got all fives, yeah
I might be the greatest all time

Too stylish
She too fly
Make me lose balance
Back it up, like we taking over for the '99
And the 2000's
The city that's mine
I need a new challenge
I can't tell if you 'bout it
Too stylish
She too fly
Make me lose balance
Back it up, like we taking over for the '99
And the 2000's
The city that's mine
I need a new challenge
I can't tell if you 'bout it2Embed
