Midnight awakin', hyper ventilatin'
Drunk laps runnin' 'round the globe wild goose chasin'
After three number one albums woulda thought I'd feel amazin'
Still impatient, still sippin' on liquor
Still rollin' up Swishers
Now it's Beamers double parking, fuck payin' the meter
In your club, on your couches, got paid to be here
On your girl rubbin' on my favorite features
How could they tease us? Only wanted Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house

Around 3 AM, dawg
I was gettin' busy in the bathroom stall
Bad mamacita, Miami Heat her, put her in a two-seater
Too bad I couldn't three-peat her
Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper
House full of snow bunnies, puttin' trees up like it's Christmas Easter
With more stamps than a skinny nigga, got tats on my visa
I know the kids in La Flame, they don't trust, they believe it, I mean
You might also like
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house
Jesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus
Man, I might fuck 'round, lose my mind, I gotta break out
I'm on a stakeout, on a farm or your lake house

Jesus, Jesus (I mean), Jesus, Jesus
I might fuck 'round, lose my mind
Jesus
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
