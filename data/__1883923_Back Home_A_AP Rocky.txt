Bluegrass and String Band Music
Bluegrass and string band music has one of the most fiercely loyal audiences in American music.  Followers don't look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life.  You'll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members, and many make it their life's work.  That kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music. Whether it's history and tradition they hear, or that they hear it as a true expression of Americana, the performers and their audiences are passionate. You'll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by Leslie Blake Price entitled Bluegrass Nation: A Historical and Cultural Analysis of America's Truest Music.
Any discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknow-ledge the contributions of the Carter Family.  They were one of the most influential groups in country music history, and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to "folk stories in song".  The original group consisted of A.P., his wife Sara, and her sister Maybelle.  They influenced all that followed in country and folk music, from Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Doc Watson all the way up to Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris and Ketch Secor.
It's unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the Carter Family's contributions. A.P. collected hundreds of Appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today.  They recorded hundreds of songs. but "Will the Circle Be Unbroken", "Wildwood Flower", and "Keep on the Sunny Side" will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music.
That foundation work was built-up by those who followed.  In bluegrass, there are no better examples of where we are today today than Earl Skruggs' "Foggy Mountain Breakdown", the Foggy Mountain Boys' "Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms" or the Osborne Brothers' "Rocky Top", but here is a short list of more recent (and also great) examples of bluegrass and string music:Old Crow Medicine Show's "Sweet Amarillo"The SteelDrivers' "Wearin' a Hole"The Grascals' "Old Friend of Mine"Dailey & Vincent's "Take Me Back (And Leave Me There)"Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas and Russ Barenberg's
