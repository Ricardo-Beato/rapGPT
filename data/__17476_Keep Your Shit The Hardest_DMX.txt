Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
'Cause our niggas is wit it
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
'Cause our niggas is wit it

I want Monopoly money but I ain't even halfway there
'Cause doin' dirt, a nigga got to take the back way there
What it is, is the biz and it's dirty
You'll get rich but life expectancy is about thirty
Place of business is the hallways, I've been up for four days
On parole with warrants that'll send me back to Rahway
If I get caught across Jersey state lines
Figure this '98 and I been runnin' since '89
So that's like 9 years delinquent time, you speak in crime then you know
9 years you owe, get knocked, 9 years you gonna go
No probation or parole more time doin' nothin'
Day room to the yard, writin' rhymes and frontin
Carry niggas greasy because I'm built like that
Bury niggas easy 'cause they get killed like that
If you ain't in it wit me then you in my way, but either or
You will respect mine or leads to Tec-9 and leave it for you
The realest you gonna feel is when you face your death
"Sorry, I didn't know"? Nigga, don't even waste your breath
Coppin' pleas not D why you flippin'
Nigga know the only thing I'm really scared of is Slippin'
Lettin' a nigga catch you when I got my guard down, so I keep 'em up
Noddin' off with one eye open, I can freak it
But there's gonna be a time when I close 'em both
Lead poisoning, I'm a get hit with an overdose
Over those drug things, crud things
Think I don't know my slug stains, or blood blaze
Raw gun playin' drama, sadness to another nigga's momma
I'mma be the the one that puts you up in shock trauma
These are troublesome times and the crimes prevail
And the dark side keep a nigga's ass in jail
Bada-boom, bada-bing, some of this and some of that
I gots to boogie for a minute but you know I'm comin' back
You might also like
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
'Cause our niggas is wit it
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
'Cause our niggas is wit it

Try to show niggas but I can only hope they see
You's a little nigga fit right up in a 6 by 3
Layin' up like this, lips sewn shut eyes closed
Niggas walk past the casket, damn shorty nice pose
You was ballin' nigga 'til your ass got balled out, called out
By some disrespectful ass niggas that go all out
I bet you thought it was real funny, until it had to get cruddy
Me walkin' off leavin' you with all this bloody
What he gonna do when it's all over for real
And the last thing you seein' is that steel?
A blast of light, that's what he seein' if you blast him right
Hit him in his face and leave the whole casket tight
'Cause it's like it ain't nothin' but endin' it to a nigga
Street sweeper like ahhhh, sendin it to a nigga
When you in the house you'll play by house rules
Two words you'll never hear again are house lose
And that's house choose it ain't gonna be that, 'cause I can't see that
Ready to get up in this nigga's ass real good, so where the weed at?
Believe that, you ain't gon' see nothin' gettin' too familiar
And I would tell you what I do but then I'd have to kill you
And it ain't even worth it, I ain't gon' build nothin'
So I just let you go be that same nigga, still frontin'
Laughin' and shit, like you see somethin' funny
What you sayin' sounds good, but let me see somethin' money
For real
(dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga nigga)
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
'Cause our niggas is wit it
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
'Cause our niggas is wit it
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
'Cause our niggas is wit it
Now what y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggas is ready to start this
War that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
We Ryde or Die, why?
