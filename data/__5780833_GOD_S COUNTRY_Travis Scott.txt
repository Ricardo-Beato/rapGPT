Wakin' up, I see the light
I been drunk and it's alright
I took the drive to clear my mental (Mental)
Would tint the whip, but it's a bike
It's demon time, I got it on me (On me)
Might earn a teardrop overnight
Wear Louis shades to block my psyche (Psyche)
It's hot as hell, but where the ice?
You in God's Country, not in Montgomery
Go Ted Bundy, then go home and play Al Bundy
The card black and you know it got a sky limit
I make a mill' every—, you decide, choice is yours (Yeah)

The butterfly reflect the doors (Yeah) (La, la, la)
I hit the gas and metamorph (La, la, la)
Couldn't get this shit off credit score (La, la, la)
Hunnid thousand pack the fans (La, la, la)
Got 'em jumpin' with no hands (La, la, la)
Need more spaces where we jam (La, la, la)
In God's Country wit' the fam' (La, la, la)
Yeah, woah
