6 ContributorsNot Good Enough Lyrics
Yeah
Yo man, I'm tired of everybody for real
Nobody believe in me
Everybody doubting me
Nobody even think I'ma make it
This is crazy, yo
But that shit's all the motivation for me to kill these niggas
Uh

Niggas is blatantly, hating me, out of disrespect
I grab the Smith and Wess, grab the tech, aim at your intellect
Your work acting, send me shit with flex
Never stressing off rejection because it's incorrect
So you can say I suck, your pen is lame as fuck
Couldn't be gay enough, boy, it's time to straighten up
Because it's hunting season and you got to get your own
You follow labels and fables, well you just did it wrong
Hopefully man, you just listen when you hear this song
And that you get it this time, I made it clear and long
Cuz your dissatisfied, stupid and clueless, your foolish music
Cuz who the truest, you niggas don't know what two and two is
For my niggas that sin and struggle and working double
For the bitches who say they love you and fuck your brother
I cannot take it cuz all the fakers, they hating blatant
Your mans has a smile on his face, but don't want you to make it
This shit is real, I told him that I'ma get the deal
So grip the pill cuz I'm telling you that this kid is ill
My first paid position, an important part of rap
I spit the sickest in lyrics, I give your heart a tax
I love the gold, the jewelry, my chains is artifacts
But the rappers hopping out, they just far from facts
But me and M1, we gon' triple our income
I make a million in dollars, shit give me ten months
I'm far from stupid, in fact, smarter than Harvard students
I spark a movement and put it into this garbage music
You niggas crazy, your bitches played me in his Mercedes
My man lately against the odds like I'm Brenda's baby
Underrated, I've had enough cuz they after what
All the haters can grab my nuts, while I laugh it up
I'm tired of everyone, really, I might just end it all
I'm finna show off getting on the Forbes list, win or lossYou might also like1Embed
