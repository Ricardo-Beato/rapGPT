Paint a perfect picture
Brown like Picasso on purple, sippin' on liquor
The K spit fast like Chip Fu
Six foot nigga, but the chopper cost 6 2
Brown kick it like FIFA
Hood rat bitch, I don't fuck with a diva
Take her to the mall, let her get fitted
Put the D on her head like a Tiger fitted
The four-five dirty
Sixteen bars, same value as a birdy
Born broke, die rich, float birds, flip bricks
Sitting in a cutty with the chrome on a stick shift
These niggas might be the feds
44 long, fold a nigga like pita bread
I'm too old for a fist fight
Pop shit, burn a nigga's crib like devil's night

I squeeze precisely
Where them niggas at?
Them niggas ain't like me
See the problem is, I'm way too nice, please
Where that money at? Fuck where it might be

Drop science like teenage pregnancy
In a cutty, same color as some celery
Flow felony, ain't in my pedigree
Y'all ain't fucking with me like celibacy
Spent a hundred on a collar bone
Danny Brown got white like styrofoam
The only you thing you running is your legs
Got gan by the boat, why you blowing on regs?
Won't fall for a bitch, stand up to the judge
Always Clarks, never rock a pair of Lugz
Middle of attention, center of attraction
Got the streets listening, feds, they tappin'
I give hell to a break beat
Fuck a dutch nigga, pass me a Swisher Sweet
Come at Brown, don't come at no bullshit
Bring extra rounds, need more than a full clip
You might also like
I squeeze precisely
Where them niggas at?
Them niggas ain't like me
See the problem is I'm way too nice, please
Where that money at? Fuck where it might be

You know we tell it like it is, right?
Talk shit 'til these pussy niggas want to fight
Sleep days, making moves in the moonlight
"Niggas mad because I know that Cash Rules"
Yeah, you know we tell it like it is, right?
Talk shit 'til these pussy niggas want to fight
Sleep days, making moves in the moonlight
H.O.J. is the crew, right?

The same, just hype, two niggas with mics
Gun talk on safety, we ain't too puss' to fight

Aiyyo you motherfucking right, I don't claim to be
Cause I am who I am, pretty soon you gon' see
Guess it is what it is then, we can shoot the five
Been deprived so long, just lucky to be alive
Won't be survived by a wife and son

And no I won't be removed from this space 'til I'm done
The undisputed one, pound for pound, second round
They say third times a charm, I'm liking how it sound

Haters wipe me down from my fitted to my shoes
Been paid my dues, bruh check the interviews

Cause I'm on, niggas like he been on the cusp
Been blazing trails, been leaving dust

Now we on the road to riches and finer things
Foreign cars, pulling stacks out our jeans like BLING
"I switches all that, cocksucker, Gs up"Embed
