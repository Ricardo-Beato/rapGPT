40 ContributorsAnimal Ambition Lyrics

I got that animal, animal ambition

Why give her love and affection, she just want some bread
I ain't talking or texting, I just want some head
She from a Piru set where all them niggas wear red
I ain't flying no flags, but I'm a gangster, bitch
I say ''say no to drugs'' then I do that shit
Got a blue fleet of whips, I'm so hood nigga rich
You don't like the way I do it, nigga, eat a dick
I just call 'em when I want 'em, I don't need a bitch
You see me stunting with my diamonds on, everything proper
Your shit look chrome and your shit look copper
It's turning, homie, that's why you're turning on me
Admit it, I made it, I can't be faded
I roll it up in public, I'm a cancer, man
Smoke it out in the open like I'm in Amsterdam
I do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
See my name around the globe, niggas know who I am


You say you hustle like a hustle, I be moving the shit
Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks
Got them straps and long clips filled up with led
So when we counting the paper it better come back correct
Out in New Orleans, baby, niggas hungry for bread
Come throrugh that 9th ward stuntin' and get shot in your head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me, you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger, I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Yeah, I'm scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit, my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me, I'll be catching a case
New York a concrete jungle where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and you're dead, you'd be very afraid
I don't know how to behave, untamed fresh out the cage
