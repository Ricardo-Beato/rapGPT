2 ContributorsThe Rebound Lyrics
She just left her dude, but I ain't tryna be a rebound
Yeah, see, I'm only here for the ends, she's tellin' me 'bout
How much she like a nigga, probably figured I was ballin'
But I'm more like them mid-class dudes you steady stalkin'
And callin', like we a couple, I had to check her
And let her know that's far as it goes, not disrespect her
Correct her, tell her we cool, don't make this over
'Cause you don't like the way that it feels when I ignore ya
See, I ain't tryna hear what you sayin'
You got your heart broke by that dude
I ain't that nigga you got to watch for
We only friends, yet it's kinda hard to trust her
She already tryin' to go postal and I ain't even touched her
Maybe my lack of interest here got her interested
She loves the attention, that's the type of bitch she is
You know the saying, homie, "Fuck it, she fine"
She gotta learn that hers ain't as important is mine
And with that thought in my mind, I had to show where I stood
I seen her naked, testing a nigga, knowing it's good
But before I let her play me like the rest of these clowns
I'd rather get the fuck on 'cause I ain't 'bout to be a rebound

If you need me, just call me, we'll take it slow
Maybe it's meant, we'll never know
Not trying to play no games, I'm sick of all these lames
I'm not tryna tie you down
I'm not looking for a rebound
You might also like
I wasn't bullshittin', I ain't about to be her rebound
And if she didn't see it back then, I bet she see now
I moved on, just like she did when I first tried
Told me she just wanted a friend so I obliged
And now she wantin' pity, this ain't Sex and the City
Or the backup plan, you on the outs wit' ya man
And looking for a stand-in, but I ain't finna be it
But I could break your back in if you can keep a secret
I know she feelin' leapish, but I ain't finna jump her
And even if she the best in the bed, I'ma dump her
'Cause just as much as I love her, I hate her with that same heart
She played with a nigga, and that part of it ain't smart
Beautiful girl, yeah, she triflin', though
She go dude after dude after dude she go
And when it don't work, she callin' me to talk about it
Like I'm 'posed to give a shit, I got my own fuckin' problems
Got passed around like a basketball
She went from player to player like her ass was all that
And now she's heartbroke, sad, and down
I'ma pass on dinner, we'll catch another rebound

If you need me, just call me, we'll take it slow
Maybe it's meant, we'll never know
Not trying to play no games, I'm sick of all these lames
I'm not tryna tie you down
I'm not looking for a rebound
I'd rather stay your friend 'cause I refuse to be a rebound
Of course I coulda played with your feelings, but that would be foul
But think about itâ€”you know too many of my exes
And I know all about yours, I listened to the messages
That would be reckless if I gave you the chance
Knowing your history with niggas, they can only be friends
I'm the same way with women, girl, you know me, we kin
Not by blood but type of relationships we've been
In and out of; it was lust, not love
'Cause if it was, thoughts of us would have not popped up
Plus, I know you're lonely trying to fill that void
But you can kill that noise 'cause we are null and void
You need some time to yourself so you can sort shit out
Think about what you're doing 'fore you get back out
'Cause you looking for love in all the wrong faces
And you judging it on a bank account basis
But let's face it: you're not a little girl, you grown
You need to try to find a love of your own
As far as now, you walking on some dangerous ground
As fucked up as it sounds, you gotta catch me on my rebound

If you need me, just call me, we'll take it slow
Maybe it's meant, we'll never know
Not trying to play no games, I'm sick of all these lames
I'm not tryna tie you down
I'm not looking for a reboundEmbed
