6 ContributorsBody Language Lyrics
Damn, lil mama body bang (damn lil mama body bangin)
You lookin like a model, babe (you look like a model, baby)
You ain't even gotta talk (you ain't even gotta talk)
Girl, just let your body say it (girl, just let your body say it)
Talk to me with body language (you talkin with body language)
Your body like a bottle, babe (your body like a coke bottle)
Tell me, do you model, babe? (tell me, do you model, baby?)
Cause girl, you using body language (damn, she using body language)
(hah, hah)

Body bangin, work it, babe
Damn I like your bottom, babe
You should be the poster girl for apple bottom 
You could be a model too
Even get you some AP too
Or just roll with me, and I'll make everyday your photoshoot
Or maybe a video, my life is a video
Kush, Goose, pills and Magnum, girl, it's going digital
Girl you fine and now your rollin, I seen you a year ago
I didn't get to catch up with ya, now you know I got to get you
Take a picture, make a picture
Take a picture, take it with ya
Shawty hit you, like I love ya
When I hit ya, try to kill ya
Gucci Mane a model smasher, no I'm not a body builder
But I got a fifth of liquor, I'm a hit her like I missed her
Make her miss it, then I kiss it, leave the blow to bill of kisses
Shawty you a diamond like the VVSs on my wrists
Then I kiss it, make her misses, Zaytoven, he produced it
