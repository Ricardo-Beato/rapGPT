8 ContributorsPostal Lady Lyrics
I wipe the crust from the corner of my eye
I walk towards the kitchen and pour myself a coffee
I'll prolly step on a Lego just to verify
That I'm still alive and y'all ain't killed me already
Daddy loves you, I say what's up to the baby
Like, "What's up, baby?" You're such a baby, huh
And then I find the other kids and give 'em all high fives
Say good mornin' to my wife, it's a glorious life, right?
(Meow) I put some food in the cat's bowl
That way the cat doesn't think I'm an asshole
And put some Cheerios in the Sean bowl
Mixin' in the Golden Grahams for the combo
The sun kinda sneaks in slow
Like melting gold, it's like lava when it starts to flow
Even when it's cold outside
And the whole southside's still covered with snow
But this is a beautiful, summery kind of bright-color
Coloring book, good vibes and good looks
Got me lookin' out the window from the front of the house
I put my foot on my knee when I took a seat on the couch
You might also likeWakin' up my phone so I can watch the clock
Like there's a countdown, but there's not now
And usual you're punctual like a nail
I see the government vehicle, here comes the mail
And the package that's arrivin', it's not mine
It's some shit that my wife ordered online
Like if the sun burns out and civilization stopped
My doorstep still catches more cardboard boxes
It's a problem, this ain't the time to address it, though
I'm not tryna look like a midlife mess, but, yo
Here she comes now, no words, no smilin'
Just hands me my mail and walks towards the horizon

Postal lady, a shout out to you
Go, postal lady
You make my own day a little bit brighter
You got me hopin' that my signature's required
Postal lady, a shout out to you
Go, postal lady
I'll never stop you or pester you
But I appreciate the fact you're not another sweaty dude
Postal lady, a shout out to you
Go, postal lady
You're kinda like a unicorn
The only one to ever really deliver it in that uniform (Cringe)
Postal lady, a shout out to you
Go, postal lady
She come rain, sleet or snow
What the hell is sleet? Yo, I don't even know

На самом деле я не знаю, хорошо это или плохо — испытывать эмоции, потому что часто из-за эмоций мы поступаем неправильно, это влияет на наши отношения с другими людьми и на наши поступки. Иногда мне кажется, что я бы не хотела чувствовать вообще ничего, потому что мы постоянно выливаем негатив на самых близких людей и... они страдают для насEmbed
