The lights, the lights

I'm 'bout to turn up the volume on all y'all
Extra high, I want y'all to hear this
Turn up the volume on all y'all
Want you to hear everything
Want you to hear everything
Want you to hear everything
If you people real you can have it for the rest of your life
We make love honey, all of the lights
If you people real you can have it for the rest of your life
We make love honey, all of the lights

I'm in the bed, legs spread
I'm doggystyle, layin on my head
Turn all the lights up, I want you to see
All inside, you gon' remember me
Stick your fingers in, light my cheeba hand
Now the lights is out, like you in the party and
Imagine afterparty, come celebrate with me
We can have an orgy on these ballers and would believe
Fat skinny short long you just gotta turn me on
Keep it crackin 'til the dawn, broke is how I send 'em home
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights...

I'm 'bout to turn up the volume on all y'all
Extra high, I want y'all to hear this
Turn up the volume on all y'all
Want you to hear everything
Want you to hear everything
Want you to hear everything
If you people real you can have it for the rest of your life
We make love honey, all of the lights
If you people real you can have it for the rest of your life
We make love honey, all of the lights1Embed
