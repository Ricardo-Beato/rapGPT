18 ContributorsDown Syndrome Lyrics
You're sweatin'?
Sweatin', ain't ya?

I be that mind blessin' blessin' these lessons we've ignited
Want to bring it to my face, man, you're cordially invited
'Cause I've cited, you possess no science in your thinking
So I'm gonna (Never), you're blinking!

Fingers be pointin' and leakin', falsifyin' the stink
You think I'm pink, I bleed liquids in shades of thought and think
(And in this corner be the hush) So play your William Rhodes
'Cause at the sound of the bell, my circle square controls
And all MCs best sweat, we bringin' buckets of heat

So don't fret kid, I let you lick the love I secrete, yo
Even my foes give me bravos, and that shows
Total domination in this rhyme complication

Yeah the skill is essench, I walk the womb with a mic
And in the days of the nipple and breast, I knew the yes yes y'allin
Was the callin', clearly not for the gat
For combat, I bring a bag of my rhymes for the stat
You might also like
I'm Plug One-of-a-kind, for you people's delight
And for you sucker MCs, step to your knees (Come on)
Ain't no second thoughts and all your thoughts are from Orion
I can tell that you a devil by them rhymes you're designin'
Your play doggin' tactics can't fuck with my facets
Just because you talk all that Glock shit don't mean you can rock shit!
Your identity's on freeze
Just a form of protozoa tryin' to cross them seas

See high horse riders gettin' shot by the sheriff
'Cause nobody's safe from crimes
And even all you skirts need a checkin in your upstairs attic
Cause Mase is smackin hoes if hoes is startin static

Now it ain't all good when your jam goes wood
So as a deterrent, I use mental current
Got them brothers shook, peep the look comin' out of the face
'Cause they all catch a bruise from the hits we make

Your fame and cars should be listed as magnets
Legends never die but they can get shot and killed
Ain't nuttin' glitter when you're battlin' MC's
You once imitated in a mirror, so to down syndrome you kneel
The same status I heard, the same nothin'
My ears fears the faulty locks tryin to lock down the stops
But I earn more than your Menudo or your Boyz II Men
While down syndrome keeps you immune to frequencies I send
Fresher than a sniff off havin' them J in fifth
I identify with your rhythm
But I exist for more than just a Benz, so mends
I'm cuttin' off my friends to keep a smile calcium iron grain

Let me tell you a little something â€˜bout the self (Tell 'em, self)
I be a piece of the East Coast, so give a toast to
Plug Wonder Why back in the day who soaked his words in ginger
So when I ran a phrase in June, you didn't catch it 'til December
I'm a member of them kids from the inner city
Giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making
More money than a pagan holiday
Not from the PJs, yet I still got something to say

Say what man? You gritty like a diamond grenade
For the cameo spot you tries to fool Parade
You acrobats flip the stargazin' map, for alla that
You'll be the first to place, and ran it all to a waste
And all the style that you bring (Gotta make decks bend)
You gotta rip it from the start (When the beats come in!)1Embed
