I stand tall, I fall, I get up
I fall, I get up
I fall, but I get up
I stand tall, I stand tall

Ridin' parasail, rollin' through the grass
Shaded under trees
Lookin' through a glass
Watchin' by the bushes, waitin' on a breeze
You is all I need
Water movin' fast, washin' memories, tryna make it last
Parasail

Flyin' through the bush, we flyin' through the bush
Wave, we gon' rock, wave, we gon' take a swole
We gon' swole, we gon' rock clean
We gon' shake off the mother-mother-mother-mother live
We gon' live, we gon' rock show
We gon' pop, we gon' rock, I

Success comes so easy for you (Oh)
Thеy're waiting behind the call
You might also like
Ridin' parasail, rollin' through thе grass
Shaded under trees
Lookin' through a glass
Watchin' by the bushes, waitin' on— (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I forgive myself, I forgive myself
I choose to feel good, I choose to feel free
I will fight for everything I love, forever
And I will love everything that I fight for, forever

With me
Wonder what you wanna do
When you're not with me19Embed
