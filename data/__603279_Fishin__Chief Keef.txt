20 ContributorsFishinâ€™ Lyrics
On digits, I'm serious
Pull up on that mothafucka, skrrt-skrrt, fast, it ain't furious
Nigga, I ain't fearin', I got my pistol
Lucky that mothafucka love ain't let me hit you or get you

Bet you wanna fuck with the kid
Wanna know where I live
But I'm walkin' around with the SIG
I'ma get your ass up outta here
No, I don't fuck with the pigs
On digits, I'm serious
I'm the only shark that fish
And I catch big fish and I'm fishin'
Tryna bring the bricks in
Let them bitches see it
Found out a nigga fuckin' with my bricks
You gon' get two to the shit
Found out a nigga fuckin' my bitch
I won't give two fucks or shit
Ridin' foreign cars
Nigga, you won't pull past this shit

Fuck nigga, I done paid 22 for some kicks
Fuck nigga, I done paid 22 for the wrist
Fade 50 for the chain
Walk in, all the bitches better know my name
Almighty So, Chief So, shit ain't changed
Niggas think I changed 'cause I got me a lil' chain
Smokin' on this fuck nigga Tooka till I can't feel my brain
Like Tony Hawk, bitch, this Sosa, no, it ain't Lil Wayne
Bitch, I'm Flocka with the flames
MJ with the fade away
Bitch, I'm Ballout with the bricks
'Cause I done had 50 bricks on my mothafuckin' wrist
So I'm Sosa Escobar, Pablo
And I'm coolin' with my vatos, eatin' tacos
Look at a brain dead bitch, I'm like Paco
You might also like
Bet you wanna fuck with the kid
Wanna know where I live
But I'm walkin' around with the SIG
I'ma get your ass up outta here
No, I don't fuck with the pigs
On digits, I'm serious
I'm the only shark that fish
And I catch big fish and I'm fishin'
Tryna bring the bricks in
Let them bitches see it
Found out a nigga fuckin' with my bricks
You gon' get two to the shit
Found out a nigga fuckin' my bitch
I won't give two fucks or shit
Ridin' foreign cars
Nigga, you won't pull past this shit

No one on the corner got a swagger like me, I be flee
Fresh Giuseppe's up on the concrete, at a Fe Fe
Remember on the corner with a jacket slangin' D
And slangin' that C to every fuckin' fiend
Every junkie, even police
Niggas know not to run up on Chief Sosa
'Cause he got that heat and he gon' let it breathe
I know he talkin' but I will let you see
When the pistol come up, what them uppercuts mean?
Baby, I don't listen to nothin' but me
Baby, I don't be gettin' nothin' but G's but I'm a G
Got a Jesus piece
The long way, y'all know that I fuck with Jesus
She see my neck and freezes
'Cause I'm cold like I been in the freezer
Bet you wanna fuck with the kid
Wanna know where I live
But I'm walkin' around with the SIG
I'ma get your ass up outta here
No, I don't fuck with the pigs
On digits, I'm serious
I'm the only shark that fish
And I catch big fish and I'm fishin'
Tryna bring the bricks in
Let them bitches see it
Found out a nigga fuckin' with my bricks
You gon' get two to the shit
Found out a nigga fuckin' my bitch
I won't give two fucks or shit
Ridin' foreign cars
Nigga, you won't pull past this shit11Embed
