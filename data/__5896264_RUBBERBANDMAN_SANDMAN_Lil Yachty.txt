(Yo, Pi'erre) Yeah (Fuck, go)
Yeah (Go), yeah (Grrt), yeah (Boat)
Uh (Pi'erre), yeah (Go, uh, go)

I'm the rubber band man, sandman (Band)
I don't give a damn, man, a damn, man (Yeah)

Still flexin' on my ex bitch (On my ex), I'm flossin' (Floss)
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Gimme that Pisces pussy, I might wife that pussy
No, I can't wife that pussy (No)
Niggas spent they whole lives tryna dice that pussy
But you let Boat right on in, that's a nice ass pussy
I'm with Pi'erre, my lil' bitch came from Bel Air (Go)

She want Boat, she just want a pic' (A pic')
