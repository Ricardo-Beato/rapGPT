11 ContributorsBirdies Lyrics
Birdie, it's a birdie
It's a birdie, it's a birdie
That's a birdie, there the birdies
I got them birdies, there the birdies

Pyrex chirpin', whippin' birdies
Super nervous, sippin' dirty
In the goonies making plays, count a birdie
Extendo hold a 30, it’s on me while I’m working
Birdie, them birdies, drop top, worth a birdie
My wristwatch on freeze, brrrr
Robin Jeans hold Moneefer
Got OG gas, wanna get served?
I'm on the west coast makin' hoes tweak, sir
I'm from the A, bitch, you know I got wizzerk
Matter fact, let me see y'all skizzir
Got birds of the minolly
Be cool you’ll get Zanotti
Frank Lucas attire, I look like a Bugatti
Leave a man ass on fire for brushin' up on my tire
I'm a hitman for hire, don't fuck around with my dog

Birdie, it's a birdie
It's a birdie, it's a birdie
That's a birdie, there the birdies
I got them birdies, there the birdiesYou might also likeEmbed
