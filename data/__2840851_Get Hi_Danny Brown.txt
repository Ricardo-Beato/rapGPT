I'm blowing on some Miles, something kind of blue
The kind of dope you swear could make dreams come true
Sticky icky nugs, real furry buds
This my party pack, call it the cotton club
Towel under the door, hotboxin' hotels
Security knockin', what's that smell?
Ornette with a fortress
Scorching frontos on porches
Torching up the purple
Got me spinning in a circle
I'm Coltrane on Soul Plane
Propane flow game
Bitches know my name from Cancún to Spokane
Got it in my carry-on
Smoke it 'til it's all gone
No homo, but your bitch go Tommy Dorsey on my trombone
I hit the greenery, jaws go Gillespie
Have a nigga shakin' like he got epilepsy
I hit it twice, then I pass it to the right
Mary Jane, you be the love of my life

Say you had a bad day, you want the stress to go away
Just roll up and take the pain away
And get high
Every morning I wake up, first thing, I roll up
Before I get my day started, first I gotta bake up
And get high

Your girl just left you, you just got fired
Your car actin' up, you need new tires
Your bills all late, any day your phone off
Fuck it, cop an eighth, take the load off
Baby mama trippin', taking you to court
They wanna lock you up, but your daughter got new Jordans
Your landlord knocking, her girl cock blocking
Dealing with this bullshit, smoke up on the constant
Living in this world, always on the edge
So to clear your mind, smoke one to the head
Pockets on E, you're due on your lease
Tryna chop you down, so roll up the trees

Problem of today, smoke it to the face
It's only for a moment, but the troubles go away
Problems of today, smoke it to the face
It's only for a moment, but the problems go away

Say you had a bad day, you want the stress to go away
Just roll up and take the pain away
And get high
Every morning I wake up, first thing, I roll up
Before I get my day started, first I gotta bake up
And get high
Get high
