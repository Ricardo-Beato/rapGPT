5 ContributorsPhenomenon Lyrics
Ayo Snoop Dogg
Yea
I got a question for you
Hm?
I wanna ask the question why
Why?
Do you do the thing that you do?
Shabba
And how you keep on doin the things that you do
What I do?
Yea
Tell a nigga
You ain't know?

(x2)
Dont stop keepin it on and on
What do you see?
Something like a phenomenon
Baby whatll it be?
Hey girl
(Hey girl you know Im talkin to you over there, come on over)
Yea, you know I got that shit
(You know we got that shit, go on and blaze up)
Dont trip
If you ain't bout this shit
(If you ain't bout it, dont be about it)
Nigga tell em who I am
You might also like
You the muthafuckin man dawg, that shit ain't hard to see
And what you do on the daily what them other fools try to be
Ain't comparison, Adidas yea we bearin em
Smoking on that medicine
Tell them muthafuckas let us in
(x2)
Ayo the partys packed from the body to wall
This is what I need from yall
Put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air

Imma give it to ya, Imma show ya what that business is
Imma give it to you like that
Imma give it to ya, Imma show ya what that business is
Imma give it to you like that
What you gon do for me? What you gon do for her?
What you gon do for him? What you gon do for them?
(x2)
Dont stop keepin it on and on
What do you see?
Something like a phenomenon
Baby whatll it be?
Hey girl
Yea, you know I got that shit
Dont trip
If you ain't bout this shit
Nigga tell em who I am
When I was a little baby boy
My mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turn tables with the mix and I learned to rhyme like a dolomite
Time went by in a fly creation
I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do
Put on some gray and blue and made my own crew
And since you dig, your shit on hit and this is how we rock
I chitty bang my city man and this is for the block
Equipped to hit, I get you whipped and spit that shit you like
Im on like superfly tonight
Cus I dont have no kryptonite
