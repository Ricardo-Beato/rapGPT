1 ContributorLife’s Hard (Tribute To 2Pac) Lyrics
Travel through my mind am I blind it's a shame
Young niggas gettin' murdered straight took out the game
As I sit here puffin' on a cigarette
Gotta be ready, never know who's plottin' on a niggas death
These are the rough times, best to hurry up
And duck muhfucka' 'fore I buck mine
It's gettin' crazy and everybody's strapped
Surrounded by niggas but nary a motherfucker down to watch my back
These are the bitch made niggas, you been played nigga
While you starvin' and broke they pullin' six figures
Oooh, what can you do
When you can't trust your crеw, time to bust out the twenty-two
Boo-yaow, ran out of weed, so I'm sippin'
On this Hеnnesey, tell me, do you feel me?
Hey, I have no remorse
As I take another sip of my liquor and spit my sick thoughts, oooh

Thuggin to the fullest, got my strap, I'ma pull it
I'm the first muhfucka' that can outrun a bullet
It's them Thug Life niggas, them done like triggers
Got these punk wannabes and they jockin' like bitches
Now my riches is gettin' hoe-zone, it's on
Fuck a mystery, do you wanna get with me, then let's bone
I'ma take her to my hideout, cause I'm smokin' that spinach
And stayin' strong to the finish and then I ride out
See you on the freeway, sorry baby
But I gotta call my homey see what he say
I ain't got no time, I gotta get mine
I keep my mind on my loot, I'll shoot everytime
And ain't no way I'ma let bitch made nigga worry me
Catch me slippin', empty the clip and bury me
Hell nah nigga have to plug me twice
Ain't no slippin' when you Thug for Life, motherfucker can you see?You might also likeEmbed
