9 ContributorsYou Could Be Blind Lyrics
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit (Uh)
Go where I go, dog in my life (Oh, ohh)
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
"Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life (Oh, ohh)

Now if you start with dirt, then you start with hurt
You start with "Oh, you ain't got?"
Well here, take my shirt (Aight?)
Start with work, blood and tears over the years
Goin' through whatever we go through, we stickin' it out here
Pups turn into dogs, tadpoles into frogs
I'm just eatin' what's in front of me, ain't thinking about yours
But I'mma keep my paws on what's mine (Uh!)
Beg 'til I find (Uh!)
Strapped 'til I'm blind (Uh!), and I'm (What?!)
A nigga that whatever I do, still gon' be able to spit this
I'm wit' this, cause this is mine, you scared shitless (Woo)
Rap niggas can't fuck with the dog (Uhh!)
Never, could be twenty below outside
I'm built for the weather (Aight?)
It could be hotter than lava, I wouldn't bother to sweat
To some of you niggas, I'm a father, but you startin' to forget
I paid my dues, not only could you not wear
But you would really love it
If you could meet the cat that made my shoes
C'mon!
You might also like
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life (Oh, ohh)
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life (Oh, ohh)

Uh
Now see, what I do is peep shit, keep shit low key
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh ,uh, what?)
Keep paying attention to what you trying to show me
Listen, but you never know me, listen (What?)
Don't give me and don't owe me
Don't tell me that you love me (Uh)
Don't talk shit, don't kill me slowly
Cause a dog like me, is an only
Meaning, hit another like me, the truth hurts, but I can't be phony
You always looking for bad (UH!)
Look at you mad
But you won't be satisfied 'til it took what you had
(Aight) See, I'm a thorough nigga, I keep my word
And anybody that's ever met me, got love for me
So I keep a heard
And that shit y'all niggas told me got me fucked up in the head
Went from, "Yo, that's my dog"
To, "Get that nigga dead"
What the fuck is all this? (What?)
News to me
Dog it's like that? Ain't what it used to be
See some niggas choose to be on the other side of the fence (Uh)
Keep riding with this (Uh)
Get fried in the mix (C'mon!)
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life (Oh, ohh)
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
"Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life (Oh, ohh)

Now if it ain't that, then don't say that
Cause I don't play that, y'all play that
But the okay black, damn, why you say that?
I thought that (What?)
Nevermind, I just thought it
We supposed to keep it real
I'm just doing what I was taught (Aight?)
Misery, loves company (Uh)
Now you niggas talkin' 'bout
Jumpin' me (Uh), pumpin' me
Full of slugs, blood, what's up, with the love
Damn, understand, what a real, nigga does
Don't listen to the buzz, don't get caught up in the hype
You'll lose everything that you worked for
Tryin' to take a nigga's stripes (Aight?)
Live life through life (Uh-huh), and so on and so on (Uh!)
That's one to grow on, man, get your flow on
You niggas gettin' too old for this kid shit
On the real, we all done did shit to get shit (Hmmm)
Snake shit, right is right, wrong is wrong
Muh'fucker, listen to this song
You see what shit I'm on (C'mon!)
