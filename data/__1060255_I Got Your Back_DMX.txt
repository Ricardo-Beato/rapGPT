8 ContributorsI Got Your Back Lyrics
Yeah, see, the dog—
I know you heard it before, but— hm, haha
This is that— This is that Bonnie and Clyde (Let's go)

He got my back, I got him
I can't walk this dog without him
He won't be the same without me
Down for whatever and that's how it's gon' be, yeah
He got my back, I got him
I can't walk this dog without him
He won't be the same without me
Down for whatever and that's how it's gon' be, yeah

Don't get discouraged if your dreams don't come true
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you
When the stress is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you, oh

Shorty got my back like a jacket
Hold me down when I can't hack it
Bring in the paper, she stack it
Walking together with the ratchet, mami gon' snatch it
Drop the ball and she catch it, that's how we do
Bonnie and Clyde, nigga, this how we do
She down for the ride, nigga, this how we do
'Til a nigga die, this how we do
You might also like
Don't get discouraged if your dreams don't come true
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you
When the stress is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you, oh (Yo)

I hold him down like nobody else
So when it's time to ride, I'm by his side, he don't count on nobody else
Run up in the spot with the hammers
Hoodies, sweats and bandanas, disable them cameras
Get what we came for (Come on, let's get gone)
'Cause when it come to that paper (We get it on)
I'm here for him 'cause I know he need that
And I'ma be by side 'til the day that I die, believe that (Secret Specialists)

He got my back, I got him
I can't walk this dog without him
He won't be the same without me
Down for whatever and that's how it's gon' be
He got my back, I got him
I can't walk this dog without him
He won't be the same without me
Down for whatever and that's how it's gon' be, yeah
When it rains, it pours, my pains are yours
Pop with the mop and bleach so it stains the floors
We gon' clean up the mess we made
Roll out and live good for the rest of our days
She got me and I got her
Still get up in that pussy like, "Grr"
We don't even care, put that behind us
Cops looking for us, let the motherfuckers find us

Don't get discouraged if your dreams don't come true
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you
When the stress is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you, oh
Don't get discouraged if your dreams don't come true
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you
When the stress is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you, oh3Embed
