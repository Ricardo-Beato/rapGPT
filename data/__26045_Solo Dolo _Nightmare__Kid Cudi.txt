Listen good, I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself continuously
Then I won't be afraid, no, no

Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

Look at me, you tell me just what you see
Am I someone whom you may love, or enemy?
Am I speaking for you and yours, or someone else?
I need some answers, yeah, yeah

Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
You might also like
My world turns, flippin' the bird
To the ones who figure
Me outcast, no, not the duo
Back in Shaker Heights where they knew who
Dos little brother was a strange one, boo-hoo
Cry me a river, hater, look who
Traveled out an igloo
Cold-cold world wasn't fit for me at all
Look at where I stand at, tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizzalls
Mute motherfuckers back home, quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me, I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floating in my mind, no sail
Ahoy, ahoy

Listen good, I don't need nobody
This is, what you feel, are the sounds of insanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
No, I won't be afraid, hey, hey

Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Why must it feel so right
When I know that it's wrong? It's wrong
When will I ever learn
From the words in my songs?
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo59Embed
