Me know, me know, me know, me know, me know, me know
I walk in the dream of a kid from the go
Some people say when we defeat the beast, the peace will glow
Lead 'em to the freedom, when I lead 'em, yo, they grow
Big up hallelujah when I'm feelin' low low
It shall pass, there's a bigger photo
My cup overflow, I can't do it solo
When the revolution comes, it'll be beautiful
I serenadе like a renegadе, never been afraid
Of Virginia wolf, I'm the black sheep
Known on black streets, no dig
A beautiful Chicago kid that won't renege
I might zag zig ya life adlib
To find my voice, good city, mad kid
Under the fig tree
Unafraid in the land where the most high becomes the wave

Blessed from my head to the sole of my feet
The word I said, it ain't nothin' out of reach
Do what I say, I achieved, I achieved
You want the world? Let me preach, let me preach
I manifest everything that you see
I bought a chain from the streets of the street
Did what I said, I achieved, I achieved
And like I said, it ain't nothin' out of reach
You might also like
New elections, reflection
Protests, marches
Family came together like a partridge
Ain't playin' ya game, I got my own cartridge
Only playin' I do is with Lynn Nottage
I found silence sittin' in my own cottage
There I had to acknowledge where I'm not polished
Juiced up by the queen, a green goddess
The less I move, the more I know where God is
Times is hard, so I had to come the hardest
We gon' work it out, still pray for the jobless
Still be on Cottage, still be on Stoney
When I'm at the crib, some say you still owe me
In some ways, I do to who, much is given
Much is required when you the true in livin'
Better fruit, don't eat the forbidden
Speak into existence is how I make decisions

Blessed from my head to the sole of my feet
The word I said, it ain't nothin' out of reach
Do what I say, I achieved, I achieved
You want the world? Let me preach, let me preach
I manifest everything that you see
I bought a chain from the streets of the street
Did what I said, I achieved, I achieved
And like I said, it ain't nothin' out of reachEmbed
