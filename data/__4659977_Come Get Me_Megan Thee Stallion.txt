9 ContributorsCome Get Me Lyrics
It don't take that much (Much)
Just hit me when you home (Home)
I'm leaving the club, you should see what I got on (See what I got on)
Don't take too long, I'll be waiting by the phone
And I need you to come get me (Come get me)
Can you come get me? (Come get me)
Can you come get me?
Can you come get me? (Come get me)
Can you just come get me tonight?

I admit that's my ex, got some good sex (Uh-huh)
Call him Dracula, he bend me over suck that pussy from the back
And I be shivering, he delivering all kinda long dick, it make me kinda homesick
"Megan, where you been at? It's been a minute
You best not be lettin' these niggas get all up in it"
I laugh it off like I ain't hear him, mind your business (Mind your business)
'Cause you stupid or something to think that I'on know you fuckin
Pull up, yeah, we both know the routine
The last time we talk, we said some shit that we ain't mean (I ain't mean it)
It's a shame your new girl stalkin' me (Ole crazy ass girl)
The bitch must know your tongue crip walkin' me, shit
How you gon' resist this? Boy, you know you miss this
Forever be your missus, even as a mistress (Mistress)
Yeah, I know you're missing how I tongue kiss
Got your body covered in my lipstick (Mwah)
You might also like
It don't take that much (Much)
Just hit me when you home (Home)
I'm leaving the club, you should see what I got on (See what I got on)
Don't take too long, I'll be waiting by the phone
And I need you to come get me (Come get me)
Can you come get me? (Come get me)
Can you come get me?
Can you come get me? (Come get me)
Can you just come get me tonight?

I got that ooh-wee
Throw it back at you while you squeezin' on my booty
Throw them legs up like the doors on the 'ghini
Bendin' in positions and I make this shit look easy
Which way you wanna do me?
I need a romancer
Tell me have you ever made love to a dancer?
I ain't talkin' strippers, I'm talking 'bout ballet slippers
Up-do's and jazz shoes, I got all the right moves to make a nigga tan-do
Maybe it's the dip in my hips when I switch
Or the way I lick my lips that keep a young nigga stiff
So who's it gonna be, her or me?
Real bitches do real things so these double D's is really me
Boy, I know you feeling me
I know where you wanna be
But if you choose to lose, just know you ain't offending me
Shit, why you fuckin' with a five?
Nigga, when you're lookin' at a dime (Dime)
It don't take that much (Much)
Just hit me when you home (Home)
I'm leaving the club, you should see what I got on (See what I got on)
Don't take too long, I'll be waiting by the phone
And I need you to come get me (Come get me)
Can you come get me? (Come get me)
Can you come get me?
Can you come get me? (Come get me)
Can you just come get me tonight?Embed
