Yeah man, this is another 9 inch dick classic
We wanna dedicate this one, to all the fellas
Who got a hardhead bitch, who just won't listen
Y'know? The best thing to do, is leave her
Don't hit her, shake that ho (bitch I'm gone!)

Bitch I'm gone.. I can't take it no mo'
I can't get through to you
There's nothin I can say that you seem to understand
Bitch I'm gonnnnnnnnneeeeeee.. I'm out oh yeah yeah yeah
I'm through wit'chu
Oh I'm through wit'chu, yeah

I knew that you, was a ho back then
And bitch you're still one now
Ya like to bust, nuts in your face
But with that big-ass mouth
You need to shut the fuck up, you talk too much
I told you once before, yeah
That pimpin don't, like to tell you twice
So I'm walkin out that dooooooooooor

Bitch I'm gone.. oh yeah bitch I'm, oh I, I got to get the, hell outta here
I can't get through to you
I can't get through to you, you talk too much, I can't tell you shit
Bitch I'm gonnnnnnnnneeeeeee.. oh yeah I'm goin I got to get out
I'm through wit'chu
Oh yeah, I'm through wit'chu bitch, yeah yeah

(I'm through wit'chu) Ain't no way
I can stay another day wit'chu
Bye bye bitch, and wit all the other pussy, yeah
A nigga got besides yo' big head gut and butt fo' ugly kids
Still livin with ya grandmama bucket mouth ass
You shoulda known, you was fuckin with a mack (MACK)
Instead of steppin your game up, you got pushed way to the back
(Step off, step on back)
I seen yo' expression, when you seen me pimpin in the club
It looked like, it looked like you wanted to break down, down and cry
But I just didn't give a damn, I didn't give a damn, no no I didn't
Cause bitches ain't shit, anyway, so don't even ask me why

Bitch I'm gone.. I'm I'm gone hah, yes I am, I got to get ta

Got to get ta, got to get ta hell outta here, oh yeah

Bitch, I ain't believin a motherfuckin word you say bitch

Even though it's yo' motherfuckin house, get the fuck up outta here
You know what? I'm leavin this motherfucker

And I gotta protective order against yo' punk bitch-ass
So we gon' partyin all night long
And your sister a twin so I'm finna cash this check bitch

Aw, my car is parked right outside
I got a full tank of gas, and away I go
 Bye byeEmbed
