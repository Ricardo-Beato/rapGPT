Act like...

Don't call me bitch, punk niggas and all fakers
Weak muthafuckas ain't nothin' but playa haters
Traitors, and all you ever did was hold me down
Slow me down, but everybody knows me now
So what you do is sit and think of a plot
How the hell can we make money off a nigga like 2Pac
This shit dropped and it got me hot
Niggas smiled like a bitch, while I gave you props
I should've saw it as a tip off
But you was riding my dick, a little bit and wouldn't get off
So I couldn't see the real mission
'Cause you smile in my face, and when I leave straight dissin'
What my partner told me
"Yo Pac watch yo back everybody ain't ya homie"
Should a saw you as a front and fake
An envious snake ready to take my fuckin' plate
Since I can never have a friend like this
I clench my fist and let it end like this
And we can handle it the way we must
But it's dust for a nigga that betrays my trust
Don't call me bitch
You might also like
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch (call me bitch)
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch

Don't call me bitch
You claim to be lady like
You wear your clothes so tight
That you excite the shady type
And at night girl you're the type to get freaky
When I see you in the daytime you're squeaky
Clean, what I mean is ya can't be a fiend for the green
And expect to get treated like a queen
'Cause the brothers on the block's not havin' it
Let your fast ass pass little scandalous bitch
(talked to the niggas with the biggest bucks
Now ya fucked around and that ass got fucked)
I came equipped with some shit to get ya tipsy
'Cause a bitch is a bitch
And She'll use any trick to get me
And last year I used to be a saint
Runnin' around sayin' trust a bitch but now I can't
In '92 I'm living heartless
Tryin' to make a million out of 14 tracks so don't start shit
Niggas need to mind they dome
'Cause the time is on for them to find they own
Jock a nigga 'cause he did a major flick
Now you're mad 'cause I won't let you page me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch

Others got paid, but I remained true to my trade
I worked hard like a slave, to fin to rap to the grave
It's like a rope, I hung it 'cause I knew I was dope
While others giggled and joked
I watched and took notes
Never surrender, that was my motto as I keep strong
Second best for too long, critics I will prove wrong
Or diss'em, no one would listen, they was dissin'
My record wouldn't sell they said somethin' was missin'
Claiming I was radical, 'cause I was true to the streets
But did the streets been true to me?
How the fuck would I look if I changed?
Actin' strange 'cause I got a little fame
Ain't that a bitch, I was born in a beat down shack
Ain't no turnin' back now I'm makin' stacks
And ever since the movie
Hoes want to pop that coochie
Every time it suits me
And still I'm the same
I haven't changed my name
Still pledge allegiance to the game
Pledge my life to the ghetto ways
Do whatever it takes to get paid and laid
Refuse to lose, never smoke crack
A mack is a nigga wit' the biggest sack
So baby pick a winner, don't die and swear
As long as that's your hair I'll take you there
But don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch

Dedicated to the scandalous hoes out there
Don't call me bitch
I be seeing you at the clubs you know tryin to sue a nigga
Don't call me bitch
And to them punk muthafuckas out there (heh)
Don't call me bitch
But I call you big Pac, nigga you playin' me like one so
Yo don't call me bitch
Yeah, and for them muthafuckas that tryin' to get me to sell out, fuck is on they muthafuckin' mind, shit
Don't call me bitch
Yeah, I told you dont call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Yeah, don't call me bitch
This one goes out to my partners in the live squad, ey see y'all?, Black Mafia
Y'all alright you know what I'm sayin'
5 niggas in this motherfucker, you know what I'm sayin'
Digital Underground, ron keys and the whole motherfuckin' stank
Any of ya know what I mean
Big john motherfuckin' singleton in the house, heartless records in the motherfuckin' house
Watch for a nigga on the big screen and you know what I mean
Don't call me bitch
Watch muthafuckas trip off of this song
But last year he was singing brendas got a baby this year hes sayin' don't call me bitch
Yeah, call me bitch
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Yeah, don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch2Embed
