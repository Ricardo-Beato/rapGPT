26 ContributorsAtlantis Lyrics
Hi, hi, alright, hey, alright
Why you been runnin' your mouth?
All loud, and wide and free as this island
When I don't mention ya, and I heard way of word
When I was in New York, New York, New York
I, I, I, I know you might like to be up in her world
Would you smile and wave when you sight her?
And try to say hello, tell me you mean no harm
Let's ride and let's go under

Yo, you know I spit slick game, slick game, to the brothers
When I hip-pop slang, bang-bang for the summer
I’m the twist, slick dame they say you the son of
So they nick-nick name, name-named me your mother
If the fifth pop, prey, pray for your butter
You in tip top shape? Shift-shape nigga, run it
Little sis skate- straight, straight to the coven
Little witch pop, Jupiter queen
Your bitch make hits, never do it for free
I can’t take that risk, never 2 out of 3
I took the blue out the sea and put the blue in the weave
I did the bam dance, nigga, then it blew in the breeze
And word to you and to me, I get the blue and the cheese
If you a big shot nigga I’ma sue ya, believe
I spit the truth and believe I'll hit your tooth with the nin
Little witch pot nigga, nigga, who could it be?

Hey, yo, you know I spit slick game, slick game, to the brothers
When I hip-pop slang, bang-bang for the summer
I’m the twist, slick dame they say you the son of
So they nick-nick name, name-named me your mother
If the fifth pop, prey, pray for your butter
You in tip top shape? Shift-shape nigga, run it
Little sis skate- straight, straight to the coven
Little witch pop, Jupiter queen
Your bitch make hits, never do it for free
I can’t take that risk, never 2 out of 3
I took the blue out the sea and put the blue in the weave
I did the bam dance, nigga, then it blew in the breeze
And word to you and to me, I get the blue and the cheese
If you a big shot nigga I’ma sue ya, believe
I spit the truth and believe I'll hit your tooth with the nin
Little witch pot nigga, nigga, who could it be?7Embed
