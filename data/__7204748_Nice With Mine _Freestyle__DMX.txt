2 ContributorsNice With Mine (Freestyle) Lyrics(Verse)
The homie just like the Coby, scratching with no riff
And you’ll find out how I’m living cause I’m gift is mad swift
Using lips or clips leaving motherfuckers stiff
Move so many key (kis) my first name is Lock, last is Smith
If a nigga ever gets up the nerve to really want to be the herb
With the stick, he gets kicked to the curb
From the dark like a blackout, here to act out
Bring a full pack out, and blow your motherfuckin back out
Shouldn’t have put the contract out, on yourself
Or be an ass nigga, just like the last nigga
So take this blast nigga, to where you know you going
Which will probably be hell, see you there, still flowing
The game don’t stop, it goes on and on
Some shit I done might not been right, but I ain’t never been wrong
I’m too strong, and you couldn’t pay a sucker to win
Or against this black motherfucker again
Yo, this sin is what I thrive on and live by
Don’t have my ends and you force me to relive my
Other life, as an uncontrollable savage
Killing niggas over a little cabbage, because I just can’t have it
Reach out and grab it, and I rip your arm off
At the shoulder and beat your head with it cause I’m colder than the Arctic
So I write nothing but frozen rhymes
Only eat frozen foods, but I can cook frozen minds
Run it to bear the mark of the beast, I be the spark of the East
That shit you talk, in the dark it’ll cease
Slide out like grease, cause I’m slick like that
What’s up with your man, sucking my dick like that?
Riding rough is how we do things, it’s a crew thing
And swinging on my nuts cause more than likely cause yes they do hang
Banged ya up so bad you couldn’t get help from Maaco
Stuck into my grave like Dave out in Waco
So take yo, nondescript ass, bitch ass
To back where you came from, quick fast, or get trashed
Like the garbage, cause that’s just what yo style is
And I see y’all niggas really don’t know what wild is
Have you ever been through a fifth story window
Or shook my a jet black pit with some brindle
Got shot at, or got shot, nine slugs is hot
Go through that, and then you might be on my level…NOT
Yo give money some room, not, fuck it you heard my peeps
And they don’t usually say much, cause they just creep
So you know that your ass is ghost with your rep
So the thing is how you leaving, through the window or the stepsYou might also likeEmbed
