35 ContributorsLook Who’s Burnin’ Lyrics
What you doin' up here anyway nigga?
Man I came up to get some rubbers man, what you doin up here?
No shit? Man, I came up here to get a physical
You know for my job, you gotta get a physical and shit, but (Really?)
Philip Brown to the front desk, Philip Brown
Aw that's me right there, hey man, you stay up, man
Philip Brown
Be careful and shit you know
Alright then homie
Philip Brown?
Yeah?
Can I help you?
Ahh, ah-uh-yeah, I'd like to get—
I'd like to get a physical
We don't give physicals here
Oh you don't?
No, all we test for is VD, herpes, syphilis and gonorrhea
I'd like to see a doctor
What's the matter, you burning?
Huh?

Stepped out my house, stopped short, oh no
Why is my thing-thing burnin like this?
You burning?
Stepped out my house, stopped short, oh no
What have I, done stuck my dick in?
You might also like
I went to the free clinic, it was filled to capacity
Now how bad can a piece of ass be?
Very bad, so I had to make the trip
And thank God, I didn't have the drips
I was there so a ho couldn't gimme that
Just to get twenty free jimmy hats
Now look who I see
Ain't that—yeah, that's the bitch from up the street
With the big fat tail
Who always told Cube to go to hell
She thought she was wiser
Now she's sittin' in the waitin' room, burnin' like Heat Miser
Yeah, I see ya
First Miss Thang, now Miss Gonorrhea
Man, it's a trip how the world keeps turnin'
It's 1991, and look who's burnin'

Can we get you hot? Can we make your temperatures rise?
This is a girl playin' hard to get
Burnin' up, burnin'
What have I, done stuck my dick in?
Can we get you hot? Can we make your temperatures rise?
This is a girl playin' hard to get
Burnin' up, burnin'
What have I, done stuck my dick in?
Now everybody is a victim, you can go see 'em
And you'll hear more claps than the Coliseum
Sittin' there all quiet and embarrassed
Up, there go that bitch who was careless
I remember she wouldn't give the cock
To anybody who lived on the block
Now ho, look what you got
Bend that big ass over for the shot
'Cause somebody is pipin' hot
Drippin' like a faucet, I'm glad I didn't toss it
Got you a college boy, who was worse than me
And he probably fucked the whole university
Still wanted him to dick you down, kick you down
With some bucks, now who got fucked?
With a nigga for the money he's earnin'
But ask for some water bitch, and look who's burnin'

Can we get you hot? Can we make your temperatures rise?
This is a girl playin' hard to get
Burnin' up, burnin'
Why is my thing-thing burnin' like this?
Can we get you hot? Can we make your temperatures rise?
This is a girl playin' hard to get
Burnin' up, burnin'
Why is my thing-thing burnin' like this?
It burns
Fitfully, sputteringly to it's end (Aw, shit)
At which there is, a little surprise
That stupid ass bitch

Yo, it ain't my fault you got the heebie-jibbies
But you still try to act like you didn't see me
So I walk over, and say "Hi
Bitch, don't try to act surprised"
You shoulda put a sock on the pickle
And your pussy wouldn't be blowin' smoke signals
Man, this is gonna kill 'em
Guess who got a big fat dose of penicillin?
They'll ask, "Who?", and I tell 'em you
The new leader of the big booty crew
And after today, I'm sorry to say
You come through the neighborhood, you couldn't give it away
To a nigga, who's out to get major paid
But you'll have him, pissin' out razorblades
But a bitch like you'll be returnin' with the HIV, RIP

You can't trust a big butt and a smile
I'm burning up
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
I'm burning up
What have I, done stuck my dick in?
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
I'm burning up
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
You can't trust a big butt and a smile
I'm burning up
What have I, done stuck my dick in?

Done stuck my dick in?
I'm burning up
It's hot, I'm burning up4Embed
