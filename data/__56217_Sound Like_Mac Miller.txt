I sound like a bird first flyin' out the nest (Haha)

I sound like every single type of hip-hop
I sound like pain, I sound like fame (Fame)
I sound like water and I sound like flame (Flame)
I sound like cash, you sound like change (Cha-ching)
I sound like style, and I sound like bang (Bang)
Sound like trash, sound like ecstasy
Sound like a harmony on a melody
To determine what I sound like, please come listen (Come listen)
