23 ContributorsFight Night Round 3 Lyrics
If I was down to my last dollar, give a fuck what they think
We gon' load a 80 benz and a old impala
Told this bitch, "My boys from Detroit," she askin' us about Sada
My wife prolly up in New York making enchiladas
Bitch want me to put her in school, I am not your papa
.30 clip and it feel full, I'm in my mood
Ready to road rage in a Rolls (Ayy)
Ready to road rage in a Rolls to go hit your ho
Bitch, leave me alone when I'm home and I'm sipping my four
Niggas better not run up on me wrong, that shit in my coat
And it clear they lookin' at Boat just like he the Pope

You know I done done it all, I ain’t Shawty Lo
Rap nigga play with the bag, keep it on the low
Cool nigga run with the steppers, steppin' on the dope
I just-I just touched down, Yachty scooped me Double R
I think I got everything, man, Saint Laurent
Nigga say they see on the jet and on the block
Give a bad bitch four minutes like a vibe
Lil' cuz said he want some money, send him out
Spot banging like it’s fast food, In-N-Out
If my youngins catch a nigga outside, they’ll spin the block
How the fuck these niggas actin' like they street? They in the house
You might also like
Heard that nigga want the clout, fuck it, put them in a cloud
Heard the brokest niggas loud, that's why I don’t make a sound
That nigga said he don't like Veeze, he don’t know why
I rap about shit you ain't seen or you ain’t know about
I sleep on Chrome Heart pillows at Lil Boat house
I'm doing scamming, sending bows to your ho house
Riding with a hundred twenty shots, boy, that's four Glocks
Me and face had shows and lows and they sold out
We just turned a San Fran' mansion to a grow house
I just spent three thousand on a coat 'cause it's cold now

I can’t ride around in that Bentley 'cause it’s old now
I can’t hang around with that nigga 'cause he told now
You was just a gangsta online, why you folding now?
I thought buddy was your OG, why they ho'in' him out?

Pull up in ATL with them things, make it snow in the south
Trappin' by the door in my room, it’s one more on the couch
Seventeen wavy, not a yacht in the water
Rolex shopping, seen the Yacht' and I bought it
Me and Meech treat the gallery like a office
Lately, I been globetrottin' like I'm playing in Harlem
Riding 'round like we ain’t famous with a Glock and a 'Rari
All my niggas banging red, like they got hired at Target
'Bout to change my name to Ken, all my bitches be Barbies
She keep throwing me the pussy, but I really don’t want it
If her throat could have a baby, I might end up on Maury
Walk around with twenty thousand for the times I was starvin'

If she pop a X pill, then that pussy, I'm carving
I done fucked a thousand bitches who BD’s think I'm garbage
Well it’s a pandemic, world recession, I'm never starving
Nigga play with my money, leave him lumpy like Martin
Let’s be honest, I'm the real reason you bitches want a Birkin
How the hell his nails painted and his niggas might murk you?
Made a million dollars cash in a bank I ain’t go to
Seen what you said online, I just really don’t know you
Why would I shine some light on these niggas on purpose?
My bitch bring her friend, it’s gon' turn to a circus
I just got mad at Veeze, he don’t check his purchase
Ah, I meant purchases
This bitch mad I ain’t text back, she worthlessEmbed
