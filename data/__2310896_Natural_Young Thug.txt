7 ContributorsNatural Lyrics
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a natural, you're a nat, you're a nat
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a nat girl, nat-nat, let me through
Bae you are so cute
Bae you go through

And that thing wetter than a squid
And that thing cleaner than a kid
I am lookin' for her forensics
Creepin', crawlin' in that GT bitch
My money taller than the world's tallest bitch
Got a foreign ho, she gone buy whips
She trained to get it
She love my pimpin
I told her bring it all
And that's the protocol
Last night I had a dream you probably wouldn't catch
I died from bein' outerspace without the hat
Astronaut Status over this way
A1FBG Young Scooter, ayy

You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a natural, you're a nat, you're a nat
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a nat girl, nat-nat, let me through
Bae you are so cute
Bae you go through
You might also like
 come on, come in, get right
Young crew in here, they'll take flight
Any time you want it, you can get it
No ticket
But we love her chicken
No one disrespect it
You gone lose your blessin'
I'm very blessed and respected
The fuck you mean?
Get on this team
Ride a couple things
Suck a couple things
And you in, you can't do nothin' but win
Cause all we count is millions

You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a natural, you're a nat, you're a nat
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a nat girl, nat-nat, let me through
Bae you are so cute
Bae you go through

 you cold too
Come and join the zoo
We got (?)
We smoke ounces
You know that
Money we countin'
Taller than a mountain
I'm way up there, can't see down here
I wish I would, there's creeps down there
I love the air
I'm familiar
And now she wanna marry me
I was like don't embarrass me
I got goons they gone carry me
And if you stay true, they might carry you
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a natural, you're a nat, you're a nat
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a nat girl, nat-nat, let me through
Bae you are so cute
Bae you go through1Embed
