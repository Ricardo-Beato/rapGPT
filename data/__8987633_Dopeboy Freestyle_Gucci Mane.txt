3 ContributorsDopeboy Freestyle Lyrics
Guwop
Droptop Wizop
Wop
No top (Once again, I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit)
Yeah, go

There'll be a cold day in hell (Burr) if this coupe ain't roofless (Woo)
And pigs'll start flyin' (Grrah) before you ever try Gucci (Well, damn)
Don't think this shit a game like that label signed Lucci (Lucci)
12 think we throwin' dead bodies in the Chattahoochee (Wow)
And this ain't hip-hop, this is dope boy music (Skrrt)
I know you pussies scared, so let the dope boys do it (Pussy)
We used to get to it in an old-ass Buick (An old-ass Buick)
Moving birds like they cardinals like we from St. Louis (Like we from St. Louis)
Tried to throw me in the pen, but I win when I'm losing (Huh?)
'Cause I got real money, I make M's when I'm snoozing (Hmm)
Niggas turn to bitches when you see they ass in person (True)
Never had that energy they had in them verses (You)
I'm my own security, my chopper gon' protect me (Grrah)
And there's a wet T-shirt contest for any nigga disrespect me (Baow)
You won't build your rep off me, ain't no nigga gon' step on me (Nope)
1017 to the death of me, don't put your life in jeopardy (Yeah)
If some niggas think they made me, wasn't even helpin' me (Huh?)
They never let they weapon off when I got in discrepancies (Never)
Lord, please protect me from my friends 'cause I got enemies (Lord)
In this life of sin, your own kin can turn to enemies (Kin)
Better watch that bitch that you lay with, sleep with your enemy (Your bitch)
But I can count my friends on one hand, is you kiddin' me? (Huh?)
Only a couple of 'em (Couple of 'em)
I never take the stand on 'em, I plead the fifth for 'em (True)
I'ma get my boy out the jam, I'ma come through for him (True)
And if them two birds keep chirpin', I'ma wear both of 'em (Grrah, grrah)
They locked up Shiesty and Foo and I'm missin' both of them (Free Foo)
A real street nigga, let's pop a bottle and toast for them (Free Shiesty)
We done made millions together, I got some more for them (It's Gucci)You might also likeEmbed
