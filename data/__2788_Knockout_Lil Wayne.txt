50 ContributorsKnockout Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League (Uh)
Yeah
Uh
Yay (Uh)

Hey, Barbie, a-a-are are you into Black men?
Hey-hey-hey, hey, Barbie
Hey, I could be your Black Ken (Wow)
'Cause once you go Black, you never go back
She wear her hair black, with curls in the back
Then she threw that ass back, back, back
Then I fell to the mat
And after that, everything went black

Baby, one-two-three, tell 'em, "Get the referee"
'Cause he can ('Cause he can)
Get the knockout (Get the knockout)
Get the telephone please, it's an emergency
'Cause he can ('Cause he can)
Get the knockout (Get the knockout)
Get the knockout

Hey, Barbie, can I call you Barbara?
Hey, Barbie, yeah, can I call you tomorrow and today?
'Cause once you go Black, you never go back
And once you go Wayne, everybody else is whack
Then she threw that ass back, back, back, then I fell to the mat
And after that, everything went black
You might also like
Baby, one-two-three, tell 'em, "Get the referee"
'Cause he can ('Cause he can)
Get the knockout (Get the knockout)
Get the telephone please, it's an emergency
'Cause he can ('Cause he can)
Get the knockout (Get the knockout)
Get the knockout

(Uh, uh)
Aw, fuck it, give me that damn bucket
W-when I throw this pussy, you better not start duckin'
Oh, yo, hit-hit 'em with the blow
Look-look out in the crowd and everybody's yellin', "No"
Grab him by his locks and give us a good box
Then hit him below the belt, I wanna give him good top (Hey)
Top (Hey), top (Hey), give him good top
Hit him below the belt, I wanna to give him good top (Hey)
One, two, three, they yellin', "One, two, three"
I done hit 'em with that motherfuckin' crunk two-piece
Tell 'em, tell 'em to mop out, too late to cop out
Give 'em more head than toupees at the knockout

Baby, one-two-three, tell 'em, "Get the referee"
'Cause he can ('Cause he can)
Get the knockout (Get the knockout)
Get the telephone please, it's an emergency
'Cause he can ('Cause he can)
Get the knockout (Get the knockout)
Get the knockout (Get the knockout)
So just knock me out
So just knock me out
Damn, just knock me out
So just knock me out, just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out12Embed
