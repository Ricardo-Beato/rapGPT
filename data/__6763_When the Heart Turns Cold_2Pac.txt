6 ContributorsWhen the Heart Turns Cold Lyrics* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists

When your heart turns cold
I say, when your heart turns cold
It causes your soul to freeze
It spreads, throughout yo' spirit
Like a, ruthless, feeling disease
The walls, the walls that once were down
Now stand firm and tall, safe from hate; love; pain; joy
Until you feel nothing at all
When, your heart turns cold
I say, when your heart turns cold
A baby's cry, means nothing
A dead corpse is trivial
Mother's neglecting children is daily
Loneliness, becomes your routine friend
Death death death seems like tranquility
Sleeping is never pleasant
If you even sleep at all all all
You forget ideals and, turn off the reason
To make sure the product gets sold
You don't UNDERSTAND how I behave, just wait
I say just WAIT WAIT WAIT till your heart
I say till your hearts turns COLD!
HA HA! Cold! Cold, cold, cold... Collllld...You might also likeEmbed
