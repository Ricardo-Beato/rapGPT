23 ContributorsOff The Docks Lyrics
This shit right here
Bout to shut down the whole 4 Quarter
Young Money, LilWeezyAna
And I am (Raj Smoove)
(The greatest DJ in the world!)
Capo, what up

Nonstop
Youngun all around the clock
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks
It don't stop
Uhuh, I won't quit
Say blood, you talkin money?
Then umm, count me in
Nonstop
Youngun all around the clock
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks
It don't stop
Uhuh, I won't quit
Say blood, you talkin money?
Then umm, count me in

Look
I hustle silk
Like I sell satin
And these niggas hustlin backwards
Like Pig Latin
Dear Captain
I'm too fast for these fucks
Man, the only time I see 'em
Is when I'm passin 'em up
That's right
I run laps around the block
For the guap
All I need is a gunshot
And a watch
I see the finish line
I've seen it plenty times
Them niggas been behind
Them niggas spittin rhymes
For me it's business time
Yea, love and hate
I walk the thinnest line
And I point a AK
Right at the witness line
I'm on the paper chase
Fuck what they say
The only date marked on my calendar is payday
And you could never get it free like AJ
But I could get you more keys than Dre Day
All I do is call Capito Bergante
I just gotta call Capito Bergante
You might also like
Nonstop
Youngun all around the clock
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks
It don't stop
Uhuh, I won't quit
Say blood, you talkin money?
Then umm, count me in
Nonstop
Youngun all around the clock
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks
It don't stop
Uhuh, I won't quit
Say blood, you talkin money?
Then umm, count me in

I never stop grindin
Even if Simon
Said it
I'm tryna clean up like an edit
And if anything comes in town we let it
If not we get it and put your life on credit
Jetted
Up the block
Did the cop
After the kid
With the rock
In his sock
Fuck the neighborhood watch
As soon as enough money is in my knot
I'm yellin "Who got them keys"
Like the game's on lock
My aims on, I'm locked
Like I spot
But my eyeballs are gunshots, they pop
Outta my head
When you show me the bread
And I bet I could get a chicken
If you sold me an egg
Have ho's walk the strip
Like they owed me a leg
And it's money over bitches
No Al and Peg
Bundy
And on Monday
I ain't thinkin bout Tuesday
Cause anyday could be my doomsday
I'm a hustla
Nonstop
Youngun all around the clock
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks
It don't stop
Uhuh, I won't quit
Say blood, you talkin money?
Then umm, count me in
Nonstop
Youngun all around the clock
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks
It don't stop
Uhuh, I won't quit
Say blood, you talkin money?
Then umm, count me in

Shit yeah
Money machines
Big stacks of money in jeans
Never ridin on teens
These is grown folk
That I'm sittin' on ho
Fuck with a President
Like Marilyn Monroe
Evidence won't show
What I really know
Forealla
I'm a gorilla
And they're billy goats
I'm rare with the flow
I'm air with the flow
That mean I'm
Here
There
Everywhere with the flow
Nonstop
Youngun all around the clock
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks
It don't stop
Uhuh, I won't quit
Say blood, you talkin money?
Then umm, count me in
Nonstop
Youngun all around the clock
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks
It don't stop
Uhuh, I won't quit
Say blood, you talkin money?
Then umm, count me in
