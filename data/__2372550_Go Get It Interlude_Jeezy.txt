For every time you bullshitted
Does that make you want to go get it?
(make you want to go get it)
This make you want to go get it
For every time you bullshitted
Does that make you want to go get it?
Every time you bullshitted
Did that make you want to go get it?

Does that make you want to go get it?
Every time you bullshitted

Don't that make you want to go get it?
Want it nigga? You should have it
Taking no for an answer

Don't that make you want to go get it?
Every time you bullshitted
Does that make you want to go get it?
Make you want to go get it?
Make you want to go get it?
Every time you bullshitted
Make you want to go get it?
