Six shit
Ayy, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Six, nigga, Dedication 6, nigga
Six, nigga, six, nigga, Dedication 6, nigga
Six, nigga, sick nigga, sick, six shit, nigga

I hear y'all new shit and I cringe (I cringe)
Your girlfriend likes me and my friends (My friends)
If we hit it, that oui is not French (Not French)
I'm anti-social, pardon my tints (My tints)
We left E11even, at 11 AM (Yeah)
Raw papers full of peace, cups full of mayhem (Yeah)
We all wavy, I'm just sort of on a different wavelength (Yeah)
See, they more like superstars, I'm more like Super Saiyans (Woo)
Being the greatest ever is my destiny still (Okay)
Since a child, I focused on my Kelly, Bey, and Michelle (Okay)
Sitting back, getting head from a mademoiselle (Okay)
Tryin' to put every ghetto kid with a dream in my will (Amen)
Dedicated to you for the sixth time
Killed it on the fifth one, now they say I'm big-time
While them niggas skipped lunch, I learned how to skip lines
I learned how to kick, punch, power through to get mines
Used to fuck with Sega (Yuh), my uncle had a pager (Chirp!)
I knew this drug kingpin that tried to run for Mayor (Skrrt!)
Posted on the back blocks, talkin' player-player
If she bad then I upgrade her, get her unlimited data (Blrrp!)
They tryin' to build a wall, man, my dogs gon' hate that shit
And build underground railroads so the Maybachs fit, yeah
We in the game, but we don't play that shit
Cover your soul before they take that shit—Young!

Rich nigga, Polo nigga, house bigger, bills bigger

Racks nigga, real bigger, Shaq-bigger, lil nigga
Facts nigga, trill nigga, tax nigga, still, nigga
Coke-on-coke, nigga—slopes, niggas, hills, nigga
Joke, nigga? Nope, nigga, clip bigger, quick trigger
Thick strippers, I ain't into stick figures, mixed signals
O.J. with the brick, nigga runnin' through the white
Nigga, O.J. on my wrist, nigga, that's Sunny Delight
Nigga, diamonds in my teeth, shining like some pearly whites
Nigga straight from New Orleans, like a plate of dirty rice
Nigga bought a lot of art, and I brought a lot to snort, hey
Beat around the bush right after we beat the court case
Talking 'bout a war, that's a convo at the bar, wait
Drugs in the Broncos, start the motherfuckin' horse race
I take off from Earth and take your bitch up into MySpace
I tell her, keep her mouth shut; if not, I got some Scotch tape
Got to keep the lock safe, referring to the Safelock
The shelves fall, the ground shake, it make you do the James Brown
I still wear the same crown, light-skin or light-brown
I still dick her right down, hit her with the pipe bomb
Some niggas like to fight crime, some niggas like to fight fair
Some niggas got the right time; you ask him, he say, "Time'll tell"
Some niggas think they're icons, some bitches think that I care
Some niggas got a iPhone, some niggas had a SkyTel
Some niggas really pythons, I'm watching out for myself
Tattoos, black skin, red eyes, blonde hair
Lyin' there, lookin' like "Aww, yeah", lawn chair
Jumped right off the Con-Air and landed on a timeshare
I wear Versace eyewear, feelin' like top shelf
Cool as two Ls and Rock Bells, hot as Scottsdale
Bombshell, ugh
Blackin' out, blackin' out
We on the drugs, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out
All the guns, black it out, black it out, black-black-black it out
On the run, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, yo
Bow! Yeah, blackin' out, blackin' out
We on the drugs, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out
All the guns, black it out, black it out, black-black-black it out
On the run, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, yuh
That's some sick shit13Embed
