But you already know I got it, you know what I'm sayin'
Lil' Mexico, what's poppin'?
THE WIZRD, top shotta

I had to smash lil' shawty with my jeans on
And I had my pistol in my pocket
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
I bought all the sodas at the gas station
I just put a famous bitch on rotation
I just put that famous bitch on rotation
I just put lil' shawty on probation

Paranoid, pull in the garage, one in the head
I'm on hydroponic nigga, full of bars and that red
I'm in camouflage and I fell in love with this bread
I don't ordinary no type of nigga, I don't beg
I bet I keep that tool on me everywhere
Spent a couple mill on my bitch last year
I just put a new whip on the E-way
Then I ran my bands back up like a relay
...Certified junkie
I just pop the tag on the Benz, it was Monday
I just keep that bag on me now, at least 100
I be on them Xans and that Molly, I ain't frontin'

I had to spank lil' shawty with my jeans on
And I had my pistol in my pocket
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
I bought all the sodas at the gas station
I just put a famous bitch on rotation
I just put that famous bitch on rotation
I just put lil' shawty on probation

Yeah, I fell asleep with that paper
Brooooo, I can't tell you 'bout no capers
I just took the middle man off
I go Corleone 'bout the check
I was getting dome with a Tech
Bitch, you ain't gon' get no extra points pulling no faggot move
I just called my contractor, told him "build another pool"
One sitt in the back, one by the living room
I keep all my jewelry at the bank now
Alexander McQueen's therapeutic
Bitch, I'm getting the same money as Cam Newton
Ask me how it feel to be a millionare

I had to spank lil' shawty with my jeans on
And I had my pistol in my pocket
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
I bought all the sodas at the gas station
I just put a famous bitch on rotation
I just put that famous bitch on rotation
I just put lil' shawty on probation15Embed
