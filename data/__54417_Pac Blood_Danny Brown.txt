79 ContributorsPac Blood Lyrics
The Shakespeare of sixteens, dipping my ink pen
Made a sculpture of me, but my dick was too thin
Paint pictures of me, but they never get my chin
One writing scriptures, bringing tears to the princess
Every time I indent, you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent, hanging onto every sentence
Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants 'cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide
I'm the town hero 'cause my words give 'em pride
And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for
Leave 'em all astonished, ride with the verbs
Make a grown man cry with strength of the words

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that'll make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Have Virgin Mary doing lines in the pickup
Make Sarah Palin deepthroat 'til she hiccup
Have T.D. Jakes 'round this bitch doing stick-ups
Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs

What's in the portfolio? Sicker than polio
Shit so personal, my mom can't listen to
But oh-so-original, nigga's extra crispy
Bars so Bukowski, Soda Popinski
Little Macs could never be number one, your time's done
Bomb filling smelling like napalm, your day's gone
Langston Hughes with a blew fuse and a screw loose
Maya Angelou, abused child with a notebook
Spitting like Kipling with a tooth missing
Tongue bring torture to men, women, and children
The memoir's sacred, hid in the basement
Await my next piece at a formal engagement
Crowds walk for miles just to hear that sound
Starting to get more power than the ones that wear crowns

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that'll make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Have the Virgin Mary doing lines in the pickup
Make Sarah Palin deepthroat 'til she hiccup
Have T.D. Jakes 'round this bitch doing stick-ups
Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs13Embed
