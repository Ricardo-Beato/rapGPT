51 ContributorsPop Thieves (Make It Feel Good) Lyrics
Now that we have found this love, baby
I can't explain my feel, oh
Now that we have found this love, baby
I've never felt this real, oh
Loving you is all I know, baby
You make me feel so high, oh no
I just wanna feel your love, baby
You know I'm down to ride, oh no no

When your song is on and your hand's in mine
And I'm holding you tight, make it feel good
Let me hold it down, I'm so glad we found
It's whenever you like, make it feel good

Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good

Now that we have found this love, baby
These haters can't say shit, oh
I know sometimes it's hard when I'm so far
I know you miss this di-love
Let's go somewhere far away, baby
Where we don't need no phone, oh
Cause now that we have found this love, baby
You'll never be alone, oh oh
You might also like
When your song is on and your hand's in mine
And I'm holding you tight, make it feel good
Let me hold it down, I'm so glad we found
It's whenever you like, make it feel good

Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good

All my friends are telling me, oh
You need to slow it down, yeah
But I'm so tired of wasting all this time
I need your love right now
Give it to me like oh, ooh yeah
All that I want now, yeah
Give it to me like oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, give it to me like

Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright
Make you feel good, make you feel good
Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright
Make you feel good, make you feel good
I used to walk on the beach at night
I remember
The best time was when well, me and you
We got all our friends and we got a tent
We slept in it
Not the whole night, but just enough time
Magic happened, nothing was born luckily
It's up to me, but
Then we left
The times have changed
The pleasures that I feel
They say you never say never, it's real
Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep
I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep
I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room Under the moon, romance
Hold on, brother81Embed
