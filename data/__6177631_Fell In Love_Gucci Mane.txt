5 ContributorsFell In Love Lyrics
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to hustling, and I fell in love
I'm selling dubs, I'm selling dubs
Put my eyes on that white girl, and fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to money, and I fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
 chopper 

I fell in love, with selling drugs
Turned fifteen, dropped out the porch, then I ran it up
Beat some murder charges, fifty racks, and all dubs
Playing with the birds, in the kitchen, cooking dub
I'm a trap-a-holic, no after  I'm balling
Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, cooking what-ya-ma-call-it
Nasty with the wrist, cooking shiney 
Yello diamonds got me looking like 
In the pot with the whites, I ain't color 
In the trap with glass, mathematics
I met Ben Franklin, 
Married to the money, just bought that ho a Range
You know I keep that white, same color 
Twin-turbo  sitting on them things
When you talking traps, nigga we the kings
Put a hole in your head like Krispy Kreme
You might also like
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to hustling, and I fell in love
I'm selling dubs, I'm selling dubs
Put my eyes on that white girl, and fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to money, and I fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
 chopper 

Lookin' for that right girl, fell in love with drugs
I'm a bad influence, have you fucking with that white girl
Boy, you need a fix, Imma sell that shit for thirty-six
Super stupid swag, fuck a bag 
Go with the work in the cab
Act funny, and we whippin' your ass
I got to get to the cash
With a hundred goons, with a Glock and a mask
I'm balling on niggas, I knew I would
Smoking on strong instead of wood
Original squad, and that's a fact
Fucking with Gucci, you know you good
Man, you talking on your TV
You got me missing the 
Videos I got on BET
Show you that I still be in the hood
Boy you scared, you don't come around
Stopped menacing, now you ain't feeling good?
This might be out of your range
You need to go back to Hollywood
And I'll come serve you in Hollywood
Fell in love with that paper
So much white on my hands
Like I got the Michael glove with this paper
In this squad we trust, you better mob with us
You better not shop with them
They got it all from us
And I get you 
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to hustling, and I fell in love
I'm selling dubs, I'm selling dubs
Got my eyes on that white girl, and fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to money, and I fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
 chopper 

Mo money, I fell in love
Why we know you selling drugs?
Bitch got hella plugs
 don't tell them 
 don't settle 
They just tryna sell 
Keep that shotgun with us, just like Elmer Fudd
Keep that white for them niggas,  don't test your luck
See when we mention Dunk, he ain't dead to us
We ain't regular
We ain't got them bitch 
I was getting bitches fore I dropped a mixtape
Push, I give a fuck bout what a bitch say
This is national fuck your friend day
You don't speak of the payso, I don't 
Dead presidents 
I be working while you using all your sick days
That's why we look like the Falkins where Michael Vick plays
You can ask my nigga Green, but his shit made
From the ghetto like them bitches with them big brades
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to hustling, and I fell in love
I'm selling dubs, I'm selling dubs
Got my eyes on that white girl, and fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
Got introduced to money, and I fell in love
I fell in love, I fell in love
