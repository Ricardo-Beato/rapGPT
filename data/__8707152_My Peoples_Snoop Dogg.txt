1 ContributorMy Peoples Lyrics
Yea, that's my people's right there man
With blood over there? Yea, that's my people
Guns over there? Yea, that's my people
Every time they pass me right there, that's my people
They all my peoples man

Shit don't change on the block I'm from
We tic toc sock knock and we run
All for fun, just to become the immaculate one
Get you some, better got you some
Don't bе hard headed cause you hеaded for the fall
My man just a fan, said he love the way that we ball
We on the grind again, everything is everything
I got my nails done, flyin' pinky ring
I'm actin' like a king, I'm sittin' in my throne
With my roll on, get my grub on
I'm tryna stay in shape, I lift weights and eat grapes
Cause it elevates my mind and my body
It's so hard we get simple
Body is your temple, that's why the Ph love watin' rinchels
Cause they doughnuts, they go nuts for a dozen
Shut up they spot, me and my baby cousin
It seems they were slippin' by and we were tippin' by
What, we really trippin'? Why?
Retrospectively speakin', my perspective was definitely leaky
So since they was there, they had it comin'
It's just another nigga woulda added to the hundred miles I'm runnin'
I usually knock 'em out the ball park
But today I blunt it instead of getting plenty
I take you back to the old days
11.5 through white zig-zags. Nigga, oh no, wait
We blow fo sho', ask the homie from the base
Your underground, aks the homie May Ray
And thank God for the station payday
Cause everybody else out there be actin' gidde
Playin' other niggas shit all up on the south deck
We've got rappers from the CPT, K Cavy
We even got some homies from the SGV
A lot of dope rappers comin' out the IE
They ain't getting heard, they getting kicked to the curve
We even got hip-hop rappers like the homeboy Merz
Glass through alone, somebody put thugs on
Yea, don't even trip, don't even matter
Cause we gon setup a west coast battle
Where we gon battle not against each other
But other cities and states and rape niggas for their cake
Like for instance the home we tried light was BET
We fucked niggas up for about 2 weeks
And when he finished he didn't get no deal
They just put the script on cool like the minister
I'm here to analyze and capitalize
So you could realize I'm the big homie Snoop
Put me down so we go east side
Shit don't change on the block I'm from
We tic toc sock knock and we run
All for fun, just to become the immaculate one
Get you some, better got you some
Gang bangin' lookin' hard, they claim that I took it forward
Now get your hands on my motherfuckin' cookie jar
Peace to my nigga DJ Quick, Jaba Felony, Game and Western Union
