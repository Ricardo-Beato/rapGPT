Tourin', I'm sellin' out shows
Made a cult followin' like Jim Jones (Yeah)
Drippin', I be puttin' shit on
Lookin' at the crowd, I see a couple lil' clones (Woah)
Blow a girl a kiss, hit the gas then I'm gone
Expensive drugs keep me in my zone (Oh-oh)
Treat a record deal like a loan
Makin' these hits gon' keep me on (Come on)

Found a lil' redbone, fuck her like a G
Pull her weave out, makin' her moan (Like a G)
Smoke a lot of weed, gotta get another pound
I don't know where the other one gone (It's gone)
Every time I'm drivin' down the strip
Got people throwin' thumbs up at my whip (Skrrt)
In the club sparklers comin'
They hittin' off diamonds inside of the VIP (Bling)

Since 2017 I been gettin' paid (Gettin' paid)
Monograms on my waist, watches in the LV roller case (Let's go)
I gotta play it safe, shooter mask on, can't trace no face
Got a good lawyer, now I ain't got no case
This shit I'm around, I don't think it's a waste (Yeah)
They said that I was ugly, now everything in my life is beautiful (Beautiful)
Back in the day, every time I went to Walmart, God knows that I stole (Yes, I did)
Hit it with the cut then we breakin' it down, we ain't tryna sell it whole (No)
Straight from the hood, fuck the politics, cut the check, I'll do the Super Bowl (No cap)
Well-spoken, I'm talkin' to girls, I'm makin' 'em wanna fornicate (Let's go)
I was broke three years ago but it still feel like it was yesterday (Yesterday)
Runnin' out of space, I got a lot of drip I already gave away
Twinklin' toes, my diamonds keep dancing like they doin' ballet
You might also like
Tourin', I'm sellin' out shows
Made a cult followin' like Jim Jones (Yeah)
Drippin', I be puttin' shit on
Lookin' at the crowd, I see a couple lil' clones (Woah)
Blow a girl a kiss, hit the gas then I'm gone
Expensive drugs keep me in my zone (Oh-oh)
Treat a record deal like a loan
Makin' these hits gon' keep me on (Come on)

Found a lil' redbone, fuck her like a G
Pull her weave out, makin' her moan (Like a G)
Smoke a lot of weed, gotta get another pound
I don't know where the other one gone (It's gone)
Every time I'm drivin' down the strip
Got people throwin' thumbs up at my whip (Skrrt)
In the club sparklers comin'
They hittin' off diamonds inside of the VIP (Bling)

No I'm not, um, Marshall Applewhite, but I'm tryna phone home (Home, woah)
I feel like it's someone watchin' me, I had to get a clone
Drinkin' that Kool-Aid, just out a white cup
This ain't nothin' but a four (Four)
I'm not tryna take your life
I'm tryna take you out of space, movin' slow (Slow, woah)
She give me head like a comb
I break her heart like Comme des Garçons (Damn)
I know she bad to the bone
She think when I'm mad the reason why it storms, yeah
I just got a bad freak-freak
Never saw her feet, make her walk on her knees (Yeah)
Hit it from the back, yeah, that girl got a peach
She think I'm God, made the girl say, "Capiche," yeah
Her ass like a Jeep, yeah
Make her back it up, beep-beep, yeah (Beep, beep, beep)
Won't touch, I won't reach, yeah
Because, that girl, she is not cheap, yeah (No)
Necklace full of stone
Smokin' on Runtz, bitch, I'm too stoned
Y'all thought I was gon' fold
No, y'all put me right in my zone
Tourin', I'm sellin' out shows
Made a cult followin' like Jim Jones (Yeah)
Drippin', I be puttin' shit on
Lookin' at the crowd, I see a couple lil' clones (Woah)
Blow a girl a kiss, hit the gas then I'm gone
Expensive drugs keep me in my zone (Oh-oh)
Treat a record deal like a loan
Makin' these hits gon' keep me on (Come on)

Found a lil' redbone, fuck her like a G
Pull her weave out, makin' her moan (Like a G)
Smoke a lot of weed, gotta get another pound
I don't know where the other one gone (It's gone)
Every time I'm drivin' down the strip
Got people throwin' thumbs up at my whip (Skrrt)
In the club sparklers comin'
They hittin' off diamonds inside of the VIP (Bling)10Embed
