You know I'm living like a rolling stone
But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just release me

Feeling like I got money
Know I'm just nigga rich
Even if she fuck me
I still know life a bitch
Bought a nightmare, sold a dream
Happiness went upstream
Blame myself, I had no control
Now I'm living with no soul
I'm on a road that never ends
Don't know opposite of sin
Some people say I think too much
I don't think they think enough
Time rough but it got rougher
Weight heavier up on my shoulders
Living crooked 'til it's over
Can't be straight, can't be sober
Thought process so immature
Can't make it up, up out the sewer
Feeling like there's no hope
Blaze dope, my mind float
I love her, she love me
Love ain't enough with no bucks
Fucked up, that's the way it is
I don't know who I should trust
Riding around with the windows up
Smoking like it's ten of us
Just me in the back seat
With the driver bumping them Isleys
I'm walking on this long road
Will I come back?
Homie, I don't even really know
You might also like
You know I'm living like a rolling stone
But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just release me

Feeling like I'm not alive
But I know I'm not dead
Living lies but can't hide
Deep inside, the truth dies
Bought hope, can't get change
Lost my brain, going insane
Self-medicate is how I cope
Leave my body, soul go afloat
On a roll that never ends
Don't know where I should begin
Feeling trapped, no looking back
Head first in that deep end
Living like a rolling stone
When I die, I leave alone
Getting high, I feel low
But we all know life goes on
You know I'm living like a rolling stone
But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just re-

All that I know
All that I know is to feel your shame
'Cause you can't let go
'Cause you can't let go, you drive me insane
But will I ever find my way?
Or go back to the beginning
There's a thing that I know for sure15Embed
