Dun Deal on the Track

Dropped out of school, I didn't graduate (oh no)
But I still got the M's on my plate (oh, oh yeah)
Mama ain't really have a good job (oh no, mama)
But now she ain't never gotta have no job (no, no)
'Cause I work hard for mine, yeah (work hard, work hard, work)
'Cause I work hard for mine (work hard, work hard, work hard, oh yeah, yeah)

When I go hard anything goes (hard)
Walk in with the chains, Quavo Django (chains)
I-85 on the Banshee (skrrt skrrt)
Had to park it 4 by 4, Mercedes Jeep
Wide body check (wide), wide body check (yeah)
Answer all the calls (yeah), 'cause it might be the check (brr)
We will never fall (yeah), as long as on the head (yeah)
Called my best dog just to ship out all the meds
I'ma handle all business (yeah), I'ma handle all business (for real)
I'ma take care my mama (mama), and if I ever have children (woo)
Lord knows, Lord willing (God), can't go back to the system (nah)
If I ever get a feelin' (uh), I'ma hide all the millions (woo)
Park the Benz and the Bentley (woo), designer belt game, Fendi (designer)
Put ya bitch in the blender (splash), now she think she work the milly (M&Ms)
Y'all niggas too silly (ha), these niggas too envy (jealous)
Take 'em back to beginnin' (back), gang gang been winnin' (woo, gang)
You might also like
Dropped out of school, I didn't graduate (you know I didn't graduate)
But I still got the M's on my plate (the M&M way)
Mama ain't really have a good job (let's have a field day)
But now she ain't never gotta have no job (no way, no way, no way)
'Cause I work hard for mine, yeah (work hard, work hard, work)
'Cause I work hard for mine (work hard, work hard, work hard)

When I go hard I play hardcore (hard)
And I got that white, ain't talkin' chalk board (white)
Count it
That's the sound of Benjamins, my thumb sore
Pull up and get pressed (pressed), laser on the TEC (TEC)
Diamonds drippin' wet (wet), you just got finessed (finessed)
When I say I'm fresh, don't need no stylist to get dressed (no)
Heard he asked for smoke, don't need the game to get you pressed
I'ma serve 'em with the TEC (brr), and it's the gang fuck the rest (fuck 'em)
I get the bag make it stretch (stretch), and none of my niggas ain't goin' for that
My niggas up now but you say you next, look and then see what's the catch (catch)
All my dogs but we don't do fetch (nah), unless I put some on ya head (Takeoff)

Dropped out of school I didn't graduate (you know I didn't graduate)
But I still got the M's on my plate (the M&M way)
Mama ain't really have a good job (let's have a field day)
But now she ain't never gotta have no job (no way, no way, no way)
'Cause I work hard for mine, yeah (work hard, work hard, work)
'Cause I work hard for mine (work hard, work hard, work hard)
(Woo, woo, woo, Offset)
Worked hard, bought my mom a third car (work, work)
Left my heart in my grandma's graveyard (grandma, hey)
I'm in the Blues Clues, Bentley Avatar (Blues Clues)
Ain't no flaw, board on the jet eatin' caviar (no flaw, phew)
Nascar, drivin' it fast like a Nascar (skrrt skrrt)
This not a Jaguar (argh), I'm with the remix and bath salts (remix)
We see what your stash about (stash), dope in the cabin route (hey)
Feel like I'm passin' out (whew), but they keep the cash en route (racks)
I got my kids to feed, they think that I'm Hercules (think that I'm Superman)
I don't got no time to sleep, I gotta subscribe to be (I cannot sleep)
Open your eyes and see a hunnid mil' lottery (woo, woo, phew)
I put my hood on my back 'cause I know they depend on me (facts)

Dropped out of school, I didn't graduate (you know I didn't graduate)
But I still got the M's on my plate (the M&M way)
Mama ain't really have a good job (let's have a field day)
But now she ain't never gotta have no job (no way, no way, no way)
'Cause I work hard for mine, yeah (work hard, work hard, work)
'Cause I work hard for mine (work hard, work hard, work hard)
