9 ContributorsBack Up Off Me Lyrics
What's up y'all? It's the Mean-ster Green-ster
THIS should be played in residential neighborhoods
Clubs, cars, at high volume
Get (?) wodies, at high volume

UNNNNNGHHH! Where all my No Limit Soldiers at?
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? Where y'all at?
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? (Throw 'em up, throw 'em up, throw 'em up)
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? (Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up)

I'm a Down South nigga so FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAZ
I'm a West coast nigga so FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAZ
I'm a East coast nigga so FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAZ
I'm a Midwest nigga so FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAZ

Rented gat in his ride, wodie throw 'em up high
We some No Limit Soldiers 'til the day that we die
And everybody in my click be rowdy (UNNNNGHHH)
(?) boot up, or shut up, or get routed!
I'm from the streets and I hang with killers
I make music by the ghetto for the thugs and killers
Wodie respect my hood, screamin C-P-3
Nigga and Magic and Snoop, over there with me
Cause I'm a Uptown nigga so FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAZ
If we got problems we gon' bust them triggers
Throw them thangs boy, like Sugar Shane Mosley
Shake them haters, cause y'all can't hold me
You might also like

Get bucked up, nigga tear da club up
If you ain't bout gettin rowdy then back the FUCK UP
Y'all, know when I'm comin you hear the chopper go BLAKA BLAKA
I came to tear the ROOF off this motherfucker
The hyper y'all get the harder I spit (WHOOO!)
And won't stop until they start a fight in this bitch!
When I touch the mic I set the bitch on fire
Who say they harder? They a motherfuckin LIAR!
I touch the stage the crowd go crazy (AHHH!)
The Devil raised me, you motherfuckers can't fade me
Mr. 9th Ward, better respect this
I keep my head in the air because I know I'm the shit!


B-O-U-T bout it (bout it)
Tear this motherfuckin club up, nigga get rowdy
Big Snoop D-O-double-G in this sonuvabitch (beitch)
Gotcha runnin cause I'm comin with that South shit
Close your mouth BITCH, DoggHouse BITCH
Whatchu thought motherfucker? We gon' stay rich
Well, the sayin goes, we slangin hoes
While y'all be payin hoes, we G'd up
And we pushin these pony-ups
And the heat goes where the homie goes
And the homie knows
No Limit and DoggHouse keep it crack-a-lackin
Mackin actin, rip-rackin, gun clappin and chip stackin
 - 1/2
 Back up off me!

Yo Snoop, it's your country uncle Master P man
The black Tony Montana, I wanna tell you
Thank you for ery'thing you did for No Limit
We won the fuckin war together
We can do what we wanna do after this
It ain't No Limit Snoop, you been good to me
Now it's time for me to be good to you
I'm bout to give you your own blocks wodie
You do what you wanna do
Bring 'em in, we get the kilos from the South to the West
We ship 'em, give it to the world
Sell it to the fuckin record stores!
Tell the fuckin haters to shut up!
Cause it still ain't No Limit
I know they thought this was "Tha Last Meal"
But they don't realize it ain't the last deal Snoopy
It's me and you baby, let's toast to success!
DoggHouse, No Limit, to the fuckin world man!
"Last Meal" on that puta, you fuckin cockroaches!Embed
