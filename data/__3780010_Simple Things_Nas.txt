74 ContributorsSimple Things Lyrics
And I know where I'm going to

I'm lookin' in Longevity's eyes
I play with Infinity's mind, Forever's my guy
My pedigree, above your ass, you'll never see I
I love the past, but see where I'm goin', I get to fly
Never sold a record for the beat, it's my verses they purchase
Without production I'm worthless
But I'm more than the surface
Want me to sound like every song on the Top 40
I'm not for you, you not for me, you bore me
I drop lines prestigious schools read to their students
Look at my album plaques, somebody agrees with the music
Was lovin' women you'll never see
All you know's my kids' mothers, some celebrities
Damn, look at the jealousy!
Lucky me, I meet some beauties
Make you wanna shoot me
Hate to brag, my worst batch kills off your best cutie
Facts is deep, we break up, they hook up with athletes
Get married 'cause we wasn't that match, my G
Don't attach me to the games, I'm lucky, I'm blessed
One of my exes could be your next, dogâ€”trust me, don't test

It's the simple things in life, simple things in life
Simple things in life, simple things in life
It's the simple things in life, simple things in life
Simple things in life, simple things in life

Rollin' dice, throw no aces
With my gangsters, we discussin' buyin' acres
Other safe bets, nothin' regular or basic
Ridin' back to back, me and Jungle in some spaceships
Where the squad at?
You can see us on the ave, chop it up as always
Stand up Queensbridge, now the world know us
Everybody sayin' my humility's infectious
I just want my kids to have the same peace I'm blessed with11Embed
