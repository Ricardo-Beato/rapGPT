Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

I am Magnolia official, 
Cavalier
I keep the cemmi with me 
 none of my shit is 
 how much can a gorilla make?
I'm tryna chill, don't wanna put on my killer face
I get whatever I wanna 
When I come out I be 
I wish a nigga would, make a nigga bleed

Won't ever change 
 is picking up
 I'm the man  I aint new to this money shit, boy I done been a 
 this motherfucker up 
You might also like
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

I gotta go do a show,  Gucci gotta get it
 but I won't admit it
I'm a hood nigga, shawty you a hood critic
I'm on that good liquor shawty, smoking good 
Pistol for you if I catch you slippin, you gotta get it

 Magic City
 BET awards sitting next to me
 Gucci walk through, bitch you gotta 
You aint getting no money probably, so you gotta 
 Gucci winning

Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
I gotta get it, 
 fingers  everything
 puffing on that Mary Jane
And yeah I'm fly, cause I always got that egle on me
I pop a nigga, watch how quick they call them people on me
 all the cheese, I don't see bologna
Give a bitch what, I be talking bad to her
They say I'm shitty like  bathroom
I'm in the yello Chevy man, with the doors up
See the canaireys in the grill 
Yep I'm a boss player, ccause I say I is

Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get itEmbed
