And I just keep countin' all this money and this shit, shit keep just droppin' all on the floor and shit
No, no, no, yeah

Watch out, lil' bitch, yeah, I got it (Got it)
Watch out, lil' bitch, yeah, I got it (Got it)

Yeah, wake up, yawn (Yawn)
Yeah, got my cake up, torn (Yeah)
Counting money like a war (What?)
Fuck her so long 'til I'm bored (Yeah)
Went to sleep with a black girl, yeah
Then I woke up to a foreign
Watch out, lil' bitch, yeah, I got it (I got it)

Say you gettin' money, boy, stop it (Huh?), yeah
Chain on my neck is so tight and the pendant is set like a locket (Blaow)

Name a place I can't go (Huh?)
Name a stage I can't rock (Wow)
Got so many knots in my pockets, think they got Botox
I'm in a fast car, I'm gettin' some slow top
I've been totin' this choppa so long that I think I'm shell shocked
I need a safe house (Huh?), I need a stash spot (Yeah)
It's Uzi Vert and Big Gucci, you hit the jackpot
It's Wop
