4 ContributorsThat Was Easy! LyricsAight, aight, aight, aight
Hold up Drama, hold up Drama
That was easy, that was milk and cookies for me
Milk and cookies!
Rest in peace Bernie Mac, man
That was easy for me though Drama
You know I do that all day
Gimme that shit all them other niggas be frontin' on and shit
I'm sure my... I'm sure my... watch this, watch this
