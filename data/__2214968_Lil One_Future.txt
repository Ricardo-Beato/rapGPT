Lil' one, lil' one, lil' one, lil' one, lil' one
Lil' one, lil' one, lil' one, lil' one, lil' one
This some real shit (FBG)
THE WIZRD, play with 'em (Woo, woo)
Don't make me— don't make me—
Yeah (That's how I rock)
Rebel, like a motherfuckin' rebel nigga

See, my lil' nig keep that mask on, I'ma keep that cash on him
I'ma keep that cash on him, I'ma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya, I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya, don't make me drop that bag on ya
Ayy, my lil' nigga keep that mask on, nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on, nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil' nig keep that Mac on him, gotta keep that Mac on him
Gotta keep that Mac on, they pla-pla-pla-pla-plack on you (Woo)

Solitaires on me, no cards
Nigga gon' pull up and spray in broad
Got that yopper on him right now (Woo)
And he ready to pull up right now
Choppa hit a nigga with the scope
Fuck this pussy shit, we sellin' dope
Turn the hood into Iraq
On the corner, flippin' that pack (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
AK-47s and lortabs
Drugged up, off the fuckin' Percocets
Fell asleep and woke up with that yopper
And he playin' with it right now (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)

Strapped with that .44 camouflage
AR & Tec, that's a real menage (Woo, woo)
Jump out the side of a caravan
Flippin' that work, you the middleman
Got that penthouse with the dogs off it
You take them Roxies with some alcohol
You rob in the daytime, nigga, my trap is a gold mine, nigga
Pour the four then cut the four (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
You play with that dog food, you play with that, play with that
These niggas are runnin' a gun store
They comin' to kick in ya front do'
Those goonies got hoodies and money (Money)
Frank Lucas a role model
Hit 'em and hit 'em and lick 'em up and go get your own bottle
See, my lil' nig keep that mask on, I'ma keep that cash on him
I'ma keep that cash on him, I'ma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya, I'm gon' drop a bag on ya

My lil' nig keep that Mac on him, gotta keep that Mac on him
Gotta keep that Mac on, they pla-pla-pla-pla-plack on you (Woo)27Embed
