39 ContributorsWish You Would (Dedication 4) Lyrics
I'm looking up at heaven, hoping my niggas made it
While I'm tryna get them demons, out of my demonstration
I'm like fucking right I'm flexing on these pancake ass niggas
These niggas must be nuts, I castrate these niggas (pause)
Then she stuck out her tongue
Well since you act like a dog I'mma fuck you like one
I got this Tec in my draws, and I murder for fun
Man all these niggas the same, it's like we watching re-runs
And I am salt in the wound, I am soap in ya eye
These bitches thinkin' they fly, I tell em' roaches can fly
Even at my low bitch I'm high, I'm tryna stay focused I'm fine
But if I crack one of these niggas like a glow stick he shine
But it's Trukfit: skate or die, them bitches wasting my time
And when they ask me where I'm from I say the Great State of Mind
OK that loud got me stanky, that lean got me cranky
They tell me think it over over and I end up over-thinking, agh!

Cause I don't know how fake feel nigga
Cause all my life I've been a real nigga
Yeah all my life I've been a real nigga
Kidnap yo wife, fuck her and still kill her
Yeah and I don't wanna take pills nigga
But it's either that or take chances nigga
Run up on you, click-clack: pay yo taxes nigga
We bout that action, these niggas action figures
You might also like
Uhh, Young Money on another level
I like her pussy tighter than my fucking schedule
Man I love hitting yo bitch, like a Lucky Seven
I'm running this shit, you niggas running errands
Money ain't shit to me
I smoke all these niggas, call it Niggatine
Yellowbone pussy, uh lemon squeeze
I ain't too proud to beg, so nigga please
Fake ass, bitch ass
You faker than yo bitch ass
Weed good, bitch bad
Fat mouth, slim chance
I see you niggas hatin', with ya hatin' ass
I'm just lightin' up, like laser tag
Chopper clips is too long, send you back to where you came from
Yeah, pussy niggas get banged up, I wish you would give a name up
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
They find yo motherfucking body in the woods nigga
We on that good nigga, we ain't no G.O.O.D niggas
You niggas stand under me, understood nigga?
