Sometimes I fantasize about traveling space and time
I think about specific moments that I could rewind
Not to redo it, but relive it, I could give it one more go, abide
And truly understand the deeper things
That I don't know about
Now take a trip with me and vibe
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive
I'm gonna take this moment right now
Here and school them people
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people
Truly wish that I could, check it, uh, yeah
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world
I see life different like this music shit just ain't the world
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters
All different colors and creeds all come together for me
Boy, I'm blessed to be free, uh

This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind
You might also like
Doing 70 on this highway
On the front of this bus, I'm bustin' my mind open
Hopin' these lyrics will keep me copin'
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit
It's been like 3 months since I've been home
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it
Let me bring 'em back
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever
My endeavor like a feature film
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?
I'm in it, my limit the chillest
Let me bring 'em back, yo
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing
But I'm testing, reminiscing
When I would listen to my intuition
And now I made it, resurrecting
Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated
It seem like everyone's somehow related
Letters back and forth from my homie
That's locked up in prison
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in
What if the tables was turned
And I was the one that been in, damn
He said he's seen me in the magazine
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel
That's been my dog from the kennel
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
Skipping class with all of my homies on a constant search for who I was
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
I never graduated, but I made it to the summit
Don't get me wrong, so many times I thought that I would plummet
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem to stomach
All of the beef around my way, I mean, I never wanted
To live a life where all you're truly living is a lie
I knew I always wanted more and so they wonder why
I said they wonder why
This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind

So what do you think about space?
Um, space is called the galaxy...
Do you know planets?
What are—can you name some planets off?
Yeah, there's a one named Saturn and Earth
Mars—and the planet Paradise
You've never been there before?
Um, no. I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in the coolest ship. My TV showed us where we are in space—
But there was droid ships everywhere...
Well, thank you for your time, sir
I appreciate the interview...37Embed
