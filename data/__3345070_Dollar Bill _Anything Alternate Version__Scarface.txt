2 ContributorsDollar Bill (Anything Alternate Version) Lyrics
For a dollar bill, people will do anything
They'll rob and steal for a dollar bill, anyway

For the dollar bill, people will do anything (Yes, they will)
For the dollar bill, people will do anything (Yes, they will)
They will rob and steal for the dollar bill
(Yes, they will; yes, they will)
For the dollar bill people will do anything (Yes, they will)

Yeah, I'm from around the way
I slung about an ounce a day
I'm living proof you ain't got no excuse
If it was there, it ain't shit to lose
Dem older cats would chunk a nigga fronts
Would rock it up and smoke that shit in blunts
For tennis shoes, we was getting fools
We caught you slippin', we would get at you
With no respect, fuck a nigga set
We shot it up and murk his connects
What yours is mine for a dollar sign
I blame the grind, I was outta line
I'm reminiscing on what niggas did
For big rewards, you took a bigger risk
They say what comes around go around
And when you least expect it shit be goin' down
You might also like
For the dollar bill, people will do anything (Yes, they will)
For the dollar bill, people will do anything (Yes, they will)
They will rob and steal for the dollar bill
(Yes, they will; yes, they will)
For the dollar bill people will do anything (Yes, they will)

They called it murder in the first degree
And it was then that it occurred to me
This was some inside shit
That was your friend got hit, huh?
They knew all about the stash spot
Knew where the money was and cashed out
You got the nerve to act like you don't know
When all the while you steady gettin' mo'
Just remember dude we watchin' you
I spared your life they day they shot at you
'Cause if I didn't, they was coming back to finish off yo' ass
You were walking dead, it's a fact
You slimy niggas play the game wrong
Get popped, can't do they time, so they sang songs
I turned the game on, watch the Knicks play
I sent them shottas at your ass 'cause you a bitchmade nigga

For the dollar bill, people will do anything (Yes, they will)
For the dollar bill, people will do anything (Yes, they will)
They will rob and steal for the dollar bill
(Yes, they will; yes, they will)
For the dollar bill, people will do anything (Yes, they will)
Real nigga in your presence
Money couldn't change me past or the present
Homie, I'm the essence, tote a Smith & Wesson
Eyes hella tiny, in the hood is where you find me
Out here with the grimey, bitches wanna come up
Niggas slangin' snow packs, nose running, I'ma
Let you get your mind right, homie on that weed though
Baby on them mollywhops, blinded by the weed smoke
We come from them streets, ho, I stay on that ign'ant shit
Ain't nothin' 'bout me weak, ho, always game to stomp a bitch
And stomp a bitch, and stomp a bitch
Got a super boxing game, so I prefer to punch a bitch
Mission accomplished
Put me up against whatever I am busting it
A nigga's born hustlin' and tusslin'
And strugglin' and musclin'
Just making you aware who you fucking withEmbed
