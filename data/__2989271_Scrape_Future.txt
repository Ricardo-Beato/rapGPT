Shit too real, too real
Screamin' for your life
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Make me have to cook it off the counter
Make me have to serve you with the hammer
Make me have to put it in the freezer
Make me have to put it in a Pamper
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Came in the house and it's all you heard

Cookin' up chicken like Gladys
Stayin' up late on addies
Pullin' up swervin', Hellcat-y
Fucked around caught me a baddie
Cranberry guts with the 'matic
Throw half a brick at Magic
18-5 on a Monday
I'ma renegade with the money
Like the way I scrape that butter
Betty Crocker sippin' on muddy
Straight droppin', gon' get flooded
Pyrex pot and the 40
This'll get a slow trap scorchin'
If it ain't hot, it ain't rollin'
Twenty-four seven ain't closin'
They got my name at the Precinct
Know a nigga playin' in a sink
Came through playin' in a mink
Don't put the fan on, it's gon' shrink
I put a lotta bands on another rinse
Got a lotta bands on me, outta drench
I got re-rock on me, got fish
I got a kilo, Cuban on my wrist
I served junkies, then I made a hit
I got my fork and my work and my syrup
I got my recipe goin'
You see me just splashin' and play with that girl
You already know what I'm doin'
You might also like
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Make me have to cook it off the counter
Make me have to serve you with the hammer
Make me have to put it in the freezer
Make me have to put it in a Pamper
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Splash, splash is all you heard
Came in the house and it's all you heard

I just whipped up a new Saleen
I just whipped up a Maserati truck
Cookin' by the sink with the fire up
Burned down the house, call the fire truck
Oil base got me scrapin' louder
Might even take a lil' longer
Took a few losses with the 'caine
Arm & Hammer made me stronger
Watch for the do', count up this fo'
We ran outta sandwich bags? Go get some mo'
You ain't put in the work and you homeless
I stash the work in the Honda
Remixin' to keep it one hunnda
Came in the house and it's all you heard
Splash, splash, all you heard
Whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Splash, splash, all you heard
Count up this cash and all you heard?
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Make me have to cook it off the counter
Make me have to serve you with the hammer
Make me have to put it in the freezer
Make me have to put it in a Pamper
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Splash, splash was all you heard
Came in the house and it's all you heard4Embed
