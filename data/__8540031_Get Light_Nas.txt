Ladies, fellas
I know some of the most intelligent women in the world is listenin’ right now
And all the realest brothers is like, uh

Get light with it
Day party to midnight with it
Ice wet like a fire hydrant hit it
While the girls double dutch, I double my digits
Dice game pop, peace and one love to my niggas
New York, New York
All sorts of bosses who walk the walk
Look how long the blocks is, ruthless
Close range they shoot shit

Wall Street, racquetball, oysters, masseuses
Bourgeoisie, the mood y'all be
Then it's back to the hood where you knew I'd be
Driver's license and the face card, two IDs
Get light off the Rosé (Uh) bottle we sip
New shorty in my life, she my lottery pick
And if the economy slips, she gon' ride with the kid
City Girl like JT, M-I-A to the Bridge

Get light
Get light with it
Get light
Yo Hit-Boy, hold up, bring it back, yeah

Get light with it
Day party to midnight with it
Ice wet like a fire hydrant hit it
While the girls double dutch, I double my digits

ATVs, quads with speed
Doin' wheelies, black Lanvin sneaks
Family first, a holiday feast, I constantly seek
Moments like this is peace to say the least
We used to play ball, when girls watched, we played smoother
I had to try to be like Mike, a cool three-point shooter
Couldn't be the loser, takin' Gatorade from the cooler
Summer, fall, winter, New York girls smokin' hookah
Grown ladies with Mercedes Benz keys and chimneys
Friendly as little kids on ten-speeds
Makes me want to have another seed, I'm simply
Gettin' light on the track, Ripley's
Believe it or not, I'm still the cream of the crop
I was just the tender age of eighteen on the charts
Wasn't even dreamin' this far, believe who you are
The sun doesn't even know it's a star
Get light with it
Day party to midnight with it
Ice wet like a fire hydrant hit it
While the girls double dutch, I double my digits
Dice game pop, peace to my hustlin' niggas
New York, New York
All sorts of bosses who walk the walk
Look how long the blocks is, ruthless
Long range they shoot shit

And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and party
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and party1Embed
