4 ContributorsS.A.V. Lyrics
I gotta be honest
I didn't want to do it to him like this

Ain't nobody fucking with a kid from Louisville (Louisville)
My fucking trampers in a cast, no movie deal (Movie deal)
Shit kill with the bars, man, I'm truly ill
Spray tan, fade, nails look the booty real
I can guarantee 'cause she's in the tenth grade (Very well)
But them yoga pants got her lookin' like Kim K. (Kardashian)
I'm tryna focus but I can't do it
And when I came home, I'ma masturbate to it (Yeah)
If we're being honest, can nobody stop me (Nobody)
Think it's  about the 'Ville since Muhammad Ali (Bang, bang)
All you really gotta do is drop a hot beat (Drop it)
Critics say that I'm the next Mahatma Gandhi (Buddhist)
You got that right, I mean I'm not that nice
But I throw the peace sign 'cause I'm ain't 'bout that life
I ain't never so cold 'cause I got that Sprite
I ain't never been to , but I could rock that mic
Cut my hair for my mom, so I bun 'em, steal my dead skin (Yeah, right)
And worry and then I don't go bald like my dad did
When I can't tell, the first thing I'm buyin' is
A case full of Bosley and I'ma start applying it (I ain't goin' bald)
'Cause I don't care if it's hereditary
Only thing I'm worrying 'bout is making sure my head is hairy
Jewfro, yet they call me pube-head
But I ain't worried 'bout it 'cause I know I'm too fresh
That's the truth like Paul Pierce
Spent the last three years waitin' for the all-clear
Tim Ford yelling, "Don't believe what I got in store"
Fast break, 'bout to wipe you up at down the gym floor
Grab a pitchfork, tell me where the village is
I'm about to pillage it, damn, I'm feelin' villainous
Killin' it, who would , diligent, plus I'm 
Doin' it for the thrill of it, flickerin' like a filament (Ying)
Y'all gon' have to wait 'til it hits the fan
Spend my whole spring break scrollin' down Instagram
Double-tap her pictures of these girls in her bikinis
I'm jealous, but I know the whole world is gonna see me one day (One day)
 self for all these shortcomings
And the fact that I get worried is who makes me more funny
'Cause I know it's bound to work out soon (Girls!)
Finally made this song you can work out to
 be get you goin',  you already know I'm rollin'
Motorboating through the competition without no opponents
Hold the phone, they say they call 
And no, we don't, I know we're dying
 drawin', I'm just waitin' on that Kodak only (Woo!)
'Cause I know it's coming for me
Drop a hunnid on me
Funny story, I don't love the money, I just want the glory (I just want the glory)
And I promise that I'm really worth it
Funny how I'm murdering these pussies, yet I'm still a virgin (Woo!)
You might also like
That's the true virgin! (Woo!)
But I'm murdering and still a virgin!
I said I'm still a virgin!Embed
