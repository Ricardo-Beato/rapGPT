34 ContributorsPac’s Life Lyrics
Uh oh, uh oh, oh! Oh! Oh!
They ain't ready for this
L.T. Hutton, T.I., Ashanti
It's that new 'Pac, y'all

Pac's life (Everybody needs to chill)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
(It's 2Pac the king)
What do you know about Pac's life?
What do you know? What do you know?
(Only real niggas stay on top)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life (Outlawz)

Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
Never figured that that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman, nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin' cop cars, look at how we come so far
Picture a high school drop-out roll in a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out, so when trouble tried to find me – can't
Never visioned livin' longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out, or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change, it comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfuckers speakin' down on me, this is the night
Why's everybody caught up in Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas conversatin' on my life
Mind your motherfuckin' business!

Pac's life (Everybody needs to chill)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
What do you know about Pac's life?
What do you know? What do you know?
(Only real niggas stay on top)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life (Outlawz)
I remember that, ayy

What's happenin', Pac? Yeah, I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first: fake niggas can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for nothin', it was a shame to see
You know the crackers came, they did the same thang to me
I get along with real niggas, it's the lane to be
Talkin' loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket, let it rain, you see
Now they all in the courtroom, blamin' me
See, we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas, death to the suckers
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour, never talk to undercovers
Live by the same rules, so minus the tattoos
We the same sort of dude with the same short fuse
Pac's life (Everybody needs to chill)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
What do you know about Pac's life?
What do you know? What do you know?
(Only real niggas stay on top)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life

I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major weight 'cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em weary
While you frontin' like you Billy Badass, nigga, you scary
I been knowin' you for years, we was high school peers
In Junior High I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin' niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga, it's how it is
Only real niggas stay on top, word up!
Pac's life (Everybody needs to chill)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
(Why y'all niggas all up in my shit?)
What do you know about Pac's life?
(Tell them motherfuckers!)
What do you know? What do you know?
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
(Outlawz, fuck all y'all!)7Embed
