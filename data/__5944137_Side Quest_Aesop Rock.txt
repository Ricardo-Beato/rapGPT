13 ContributorsSide Quest Lyrics
I like skating to the store at night in autumn weather with a couple layers on
And maybe Wu playing over soft wheels on a mellow inclined plane
It's those moments I could swear to anything that I'm the ultimate
Although it goes against the frequency on which I otherwise vibrate
Still an alternate dimension isn't shit to miss
Do the 'rithmatic
I been ignoring every ache and pain to push into the lion's own gum line
Navigate a bit of fire and brim, nevermind whatever transpire within
I'm out the other side a golden beam of lost sunlight
You take a brittle bone out for a little spin, I'm mostly into outer space
Or underneath a haunted freeway overpass, around a storm-worn flat square
Kicking wooden toys around and vandalizing random city property
A proper way to pencil-in a Saturday without cab fare
Bulldozer dozing over every brick or black top
Spin the backdrop
Metropolis or in the pretty backwoods
Bring wax, thanks bye
Black ops, all flat spots
Rat-a-tatting in forgotten back lots
Steady feel a pull to power-slide around brake lights
See him off into the fog
Figure 8-ing in the moon
Never let him know the odds
It isn't part of how I move
See him off into the foul
Celebrating in the road
Never let him know the count
It isn't part of how I goYou might also likeEmbed
