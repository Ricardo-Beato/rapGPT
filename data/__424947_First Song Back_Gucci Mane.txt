Flow chilly, smokin on a dro Philly
Car pretty, whole city down with it
Flow chilly, smokin on a dro Philly
Car pretty, whole city down with it
Flow chilly, smokin on a dro Philly
Car pretty, whole city down with it
Mo' millis, competition oh really?
So silly, to think that you could flow with me
Pink diamonds, blue, yellow, black diamonds
White diamonds, can't find noone to outshine me
Hood nigga, hood hoes dream nigga
Mob figga, and bring 'bout twenty triggers
Trapped out, whose stash house is racked out
Stacked up, I lost my count I blacked out
X-ed out, dro-ed up and leaned out
The Rolls out, don't give a fuck I cashed out
Zone 6, yeah bitch I'm on my own dick
I run shit, this my hood and I talk shit
Hey bitch, you gotta slang like 10 bricks
Hit 10 licks, to stand next to Brick Squad, bitch
Bling bling, jeweled up like a young king
So clean, and the flow'll make a ho cream
Red beam pointed at you, better not scream
I stack green, my whole team by all means
Still drankin', smokin' weed that always stankin'
Suicide doors on the Rolls and the Lincoln
Brick Squad, brick boys reach stars
All black cars, all black trucks with black bars
Red laces, red bracelet, fed cases
New places, ain't tryna see no new faces
Hood livin', drug dealin', thug women
Fuck prison, we lean sippin' still sippin'
It's my world, I fucked her once she's my girl
Now yo girl, you bought all types of white pearls
Still talkin', diamond necklace moonwalkin'
Hood flossin', pull up and I'ma ruin Austin
No fakes, off days are lunch breaks
Blunt break, then hit the booth in one take
I'm like Mike, the greatest I need five mics
And five dykes, to sit next to me fight night
You heard right, double back sell the bird twice
I'm so chiste', might lower it to third price
I'm on goal, you want the ball like T.O
But can't blow, cuz you ain't got no cash flow
Tatted up, hand count ain't fast enough
Add it up, four mil in hundreds stash it up
Pool game, twenty thousand dollars rack 'em up
You too lame, too much game to pass it up
