10 ContributorsTime Up Lyrics
I gotta get my racks up (my racks up), I gotta get my back rubbed (my back rubbed)
I need to get my hoes up (my hoes up), I need to get my rolls up (my rolls up)
Gotta get in a hot tub (hot tub), with 'bout 5 thots (5 thots)
And 'bout 5 women (5 women), with 'bout 5 guns (5 guns)
Gotta get it no matter what (no matter what), gotta make my mind up (my mind up)
Gotta make my mom proud (my mom proud), that's who get my love (get my love)
Gotta put in a Swisher, 5 dubs (5 dubs)
Gotta Glo on these niggas, light bulbs (light bulbs)
You got your time (your time) but it can be time up

You ain't fuckin' on yo bitch, I was
You ain't countin' on a million, I done
Smoking dope with a Sig in the hood
Got indicted sellin' dope and I told the cops I was
Cause I don't give no fuck, ayy
This Breitling I got cost 33 puffs, ayy (33 puffs)
This life that I got cost 33 nuts, ayy (33 nuts)
This chain that I got cost me fuckin' 20 (20)
And I'm only 18 with this money
I spend it, make it back, ayy
She top me, I break it back, ayy
Live life like a model, so I bring that sack, ayy
Give KayKay twenty thousand dollars every time she cry, ayy

I gotta get my racks up (my racks up), I gotta get my back rubbed (my back rubbed)
I need to get my hoes up (my hoes up), I need to get my rolls up (my rolls up)
Gotta get in a hot tub (hot tub), with 'bout 5 thots (5 thots)
And 'bout 5 women (5 women), with 'bout 5 guns (5 guns)
Gotta get it no matter what (no matter what), gotta make my mind up (my mind up)
Gotta make my mom proud (my mom proud), that's who get my love (get my love)
Gotta put in a Swisher, 5 dubs (5 dubs)
Gotta Glo on these niggas, light bulbs (light bulbs)
You got your time (your time) but it can be time up

Take 5 dubs, put it in a Swisher, don't pass that shit (pass that shit)
Light it up, light it up, light it up, then ash that shit (ash that shit)
All these bitches on my dick cause, I'm gettin' lil pass and shit (pass and shit)
When I ain't had nothing, where they ass had went, ayy
I don't know, only thing I know they around for my dough (for my dough)
But they time's up, I fuck 'em then fire 'em (fire 'em)
If she thought she was gettin' a chance, she was flyin' down
I'm off these Xanax
Smoking on some damn thrax
Thinkin' 'bout Ben Franklin
But he in a better place and that's my pocket

I gotta get my racks up (my racks up), I gotta get my back rubbed (my back rubbed)
I need to get my hoes up (my hoes up), I need to get my rolls up (my rolls up)
Gotta get in a hot tub (hot tub), with 'bout 5 thots (5 thots)
And 'bout 5 women (5 women), with 'bout 5 guns (5 guns)
Gotta get it no matter what (no matter what), gotta make my mind up (my mind up)
Gotta make my mom proud (my mom proud), that's who get my love (get my love)
Gotta put in a Swisher, 5 dubs (5 dubs)
Gotta Glo on these niggas, light bulbs (light bulbs)
You got your time (your time) but it can be time up1Embed
