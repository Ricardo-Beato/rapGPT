3 ContributorsA Love Thatâ€™s True (Part II) Lyrics
Oh dear, Scooby Doo do
Oh gosh, Scooby Doo do
Ricky needs a lover that's true
Show me the love that's true
Show me the love that's true
Show me the love that's true

Snap outta dat and I bet I snap outta dat
Snap outta dat and I bet so that -
Any time a girl a-flip on you like acrobat
Any time a girl a come wi too much back chat
Come now back to the bed, to dolly all to that
Come on to that, you damn a pure alley rat
Most sent to Mr. Fabulous and learn how fi act
Nobody make mi alley rat come challenge hijack
We know some boy wi know's a idiot, a idiot
Holding you back, holding you back
Girl I hold you back
Snap out, then run out,  race soldier
True anytime you touch I make a million fi that
Any time Ricky-D chat dance must start
Think he annoying, then, girl now I know that
She may never know - give plenty a gal heart-attack
Everything you got, now you know I carry on the response
When we check it out dominate we pure tit-for-tat
Hey can ya man one glimpse o' them attract?
Responsibility, they never want to factor that
They want all a ten-thousand dollar fract'
So sit with Mr. Fabulous and learn how fi act
And any type of girl a-use ya money fi ya drug
Any type of girl em have negative impact
Your type of girl and not intelligent intact
Time enough, I know I deserve better than that
Looks are not the only that they got to distract
Said the looks are not coming on strap, better on chat

Scooby Doo do
Ah ha ha

Dad loves you, dad's love is true
Heaven on earth, when dad's with you
Son please know dad's love is true
Together we'll make it just us two1Embed
