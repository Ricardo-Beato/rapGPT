20 ContributorsAll of Me Lyrics
Now if I give you all of me
What'chu gonna give me back?
Your body is calling me
Got me feeling like a fiend on crack
Boy you gonna make me fall in love
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me
Tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire, mama, make it all simple
Flashback '03, paparazzi flashing flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a sick stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
Mwah - it just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you, but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they liar-liar-liars
You fuck 'em they, get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to '06, I'm still on fire
The world is still turning, my records are still earning
Dough come quicker and quicker
Flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down, baby
I'm a special kind of nigga
You might also like
Now if I give you all of me
What'chu gonna give me back?
Your body is calling me
Got me feeling like a fiend on crack
Boy you gonna make me fall in love
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me
Tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

Life is short, baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferrari horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggas hating on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggas sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a lifer that get back that time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me is to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever you're mine

Now if I give you all of me
What'chu gonna give me back?
Your body is calling me
Got me feeling like a fiend on crack
Boy you gonna make me fall in love
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me
Tell me what'chu gon' give me back?
What you gonna give me back?
You're gonna make me fall in love
What you gon' give me
What you gon' give me
What you gon' give me7Embed
