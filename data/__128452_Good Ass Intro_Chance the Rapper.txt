194 ContributorsGood Ass Intro Lyrics
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yo, we back)
I'm good, ooh, yeah, I'm good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good
(We back and we back and we back)
So good (And we back and we back and we back and we back)
Even better than I was the last time

Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds xan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggyback on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job, and I'm good, igh

Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good
I'm good, so good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm good (Even better than I was the last time)
So good

Work, work, work, work, bang, nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird, pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldnâ€™t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexin' my lungs
See them showin' they teeth, that's just them flappin' they gums
If they bite and I'm snappin', clap clap, collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say, "The Rapper"
Magical word (Poof), please say "Kadabra"
Replay the replays, Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck, a nigga's fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done
I'm good
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good
Ooh, yeah, I'm good, so good (I'm good, I'm good)
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (I'm better than the last time, yeah, yeah)
I'm good (I'm gonna be)
So good

Even better than I was, even better than I was (I'm gonna be so good)
Even better than I was
(Ooh, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be)
Even better than I was, even better than I was (I'm gonna be so good)
Even better than I was (So good, so good, so good, yeah)
(I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be)
(I'm gonna be so good) So, so, so, so
So, so
So, so, so, so
So, so, so, so
So, so, so, igh
(I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be)
So, so
So, so
So, so
So, so, so
Did a good ass job, did a good ass job
And I'm good
