Know I walk with the racks on me
Bad bitch want back back and you know she throw that ass on me
I don't want that girl 'cause she want me 'cause the cash on me
Yeah, you know she cappin', homie
Dreadlock, that cap on me

Back then, they napped on me
Now they all just act homie
Now I'm hot, they all on me
Pull out the Snapchats on me
I ain't got no Snapchat, homie
I think it's too personal
That's what I got Twitter for
Instagram, I'll bag your ho
Back then, they napped on me (What?)
Now they all just act homie (Chee)
Now I'm hot, they all on me (What?)

I like all girls, yeah, all type of flavors
But that don't matter 'cause I just got my baby, psyche

Fuck that girl 'til the sun down
Number one like I'm McGrady (That way)

Boy, you said that you made me (Yeah)
Go ahead, make another one
Do what I want 'cause I'm trustin' none (Huh)
I'ma love her 'til the love is done
Took your girl, she ain't try to run
Hit from the back so her legs get numb (Yeah)
Hit from the back so long (Yeah) that my own legs startin' to get numb

Suckin' me up, give me brain, now she dumb
Tell her it's repercussions (What?)
