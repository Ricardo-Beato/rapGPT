Uh, I like that, you like that?
Here's another one, and another one
And another one, and another one
Uh
Whaat, whaat (C'mon)
You must be used to me spending (Uh, uh)
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Uh, here's another one
And another one
Uh, uh, what

Some say the X, make the sex spec-tacular
Make me lick you from yo' neck to your back, then ya
Shivering, tongue delivering
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's all right with you, we fucking (That's cool)
Déjà vu, the blunts sparked, finger fucking in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs?
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother's bed
Not the Marriott, we'd be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you're used to suites at the Parker Meridien
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no ends
You might also like
You must be (Uh) used to me spending
You must be used to me (Uh)
And all that sweet wining and dining (What)
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Here's another one (Fucking you tonight)
And another one (No doubt baby)
And another one (Fucking you)
What! What! Uh
You must be used to me spending
You must be! (Uh, uh)
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Here's another one (Fucking you)
And another one (No doubt about it baby, fucking you)
Uh, uh

Girl you look fine
Like a wide face Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My style genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with your fuckin' limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo' chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mami
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love making, strictly back breakin'
Cease know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, Shark Bar, uh-uh
Strictly sex that's sweaty and leftover spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Dom P's
But tonight it's eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that
You must be used to me spending
(You must be, used to me)
And all that sweet wining and dining (Spending all his money baby, on you)
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Can you feel me?, 'cause I can feel you
Can you feel me?, 'cause I can feel you
You must be used to me spending
You must be used to me
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
(Fucking you tonight)
Can you feel me? (Make ya feel so right),'cause I can feel you (baby come to me)
Can you feel me (Give me what I need), R. Kelly take me to the bridge

Let's stop the bullshit, baby
Let me take you to the spot, get you hot
So you wanna be with me (Say what)
Puff Daddy (That's right)
B.I.G. (Let's go) bring that ass to me

You must be used to me spending
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
(Said I'm fucking you tonight)
Can you feel me? (Fucking you tonight) 'cause I can feel you (Stroking you tonight)
Can you feel me? 'Cause I can feel you
You must be used to me spending
(You must be used to me spending)
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Fucking you baby, I'm fucking you baby
(You must be!!) You must be used to me spending
Can you feel me? 'Cause I can feel you
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight (I'm doing it baby, I'm doing it baby, I'm doing it baby ah yeah, ooh, ooooh)
You must be used to me spending
(You must be babe, used to me)
And all that sweet wining and dining (Spending money all of the time, on you)
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
No matter what you may say, babe
Giving it to you, any way I possibly can
You must be used to me spending
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight, oohhh baby, sugar, honey11Embed
