22 ContributorsBig Girl Lyrics
Every girl that's guilty of waiting so long, sometime
So it seems like it doesn't make sense



Yeah, it was them cute pretty bitches that was smelling like coke
They kept going  like they had shit in they throats
They had stacks on the tables, cables
I had to say it was like early May
A few days 'til my birthday date, baby date
I'll play to the sucker DJ, looking like Enrique
Told him to throw in that Supreme Cliee-ente
He said just gave a nod with a thumbs-up wink
I just put down my dollar bill, took off my mink
Bartenders know we big spenders, gave us those mobster drinks
Sent us lobsters and cigars that stink
Playing them oldie-but-goodie classics, them honies had fat asses
Noses runnin' from the raw, they hid behind they glasses
Toney with the Montana, I came to play
With my long fingernail, your honey should pass that yay
Let me see what color you got boo, I got that beige
I see y'all from the perihperals, ladies far right from the stage
I'm 33, I look 26 with big furs on
What y'all inherit, the Santa Maria?
Y'all money that long?
Your father must have fell back when y'all started fucking
You asked me what I think about dude? I say "fuck him"
And this one bitch called me Fat Albert
The way my pockets had the mumps, you know that Ghost is 'bout it
Then I asked these young ladies do they buff helmets
They said "fuck you", took a sniff and then they didn't tell me
Just because you left home, this is Tone
Yo, you see I flip stones
Birthstone, you ain't grown fuck around and get boned
3 rich pretty young ladies lost at 6, Gucci kicks
And they picky when it come to they dick
If y'all ladies was all mine I'd teach you well
Free tales, sweet smells, eat well, hear bells
Before you sleep, read your books like it was my fanmail
And when you wake, you be a new woman, know the whole world can tell
Word life, put you to school when the clubs'll stop
College girl, pay for your books at 200 a pop
And all I ask in life's for you to be careful
Stay focused, take care of your health
Have kids and marry a prince
Good luck and happiness
And no longer shut yourself in, taste the pain, the sorrow
The sun'll shine and still come out tomorrow
And maybe be a secretary, business woman, 5th Ave., or run a library
You got the right conversation, education and looks
With the right intelligence to stay away from them crooks
Baby get on your feet, be an accountant, doctor, lawyer or nurses's aid
Computer wizard, you about to get paid
You might also like
Yea
You know I just met y'all
And I love y'all already and all that
But I gotta get off that nose candy
To make it in life and all that shit
That's why I'm here
I'm like a father figure and all that shit
I let y'all get high, and that's all you're going to do but
Ya'nawm sayin?
Cause I drop jewels all over the place
Y'all too pretty for that
Some of y'all nose hairs is burnt
I just want you to snap out of it
You know why? cause you's a5Embed
