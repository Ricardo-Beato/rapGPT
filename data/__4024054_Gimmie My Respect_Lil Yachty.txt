21 ContributorsGimmie My Respect Lyrics
Rollin' in my pimpin’, ain't no tellin' what I’m finna do
Had to muhfuckin'…
My beeper just a-beepin' so I'm takin' a risk to drop off two
Turn the muhfuckin' light off, that's what I had to do
Keys in my lap (Uh-huh), just in case these niggas stangin'
I’m scrapped, bitch don’t trip (30, you a fool for this one)
You can turn the headphones up
'Cause I’m equipped with that pistol grip

Slime (Slime)
The whole gang slime (Slime)
Pull up a sauna, I'm fine (Fine)
Reach in the bag, grab the iron (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
Still rock the ice when I'm flyin', uh (Ice)
If she ain’t fuckin', she spyin' (Fuckin')
Niggas be hatin' on gang (Gang)
Really just sound like they cryin' (Bitch)
These niggas bit on the cap (Bitch)
Carl Ripley's, I think they lyin' (Cap)
These old niggas gettin' washed (Huh)
They can buy every new watch (Mhm)
It still wouldn't buy 'em more time (Gang)
I pick the drip, you get slimed, huh (Drip)
Don't make the gang do a crime, huh (Drip)
Get em' on cam like a Vine, huh (Drip)
Yeah
You might also like
Rollin' in my pimpin', ain't no tellin' what I'm finna do
Yeah nigga, you know what the fuck goin' on nigga
My beeper just a-beepin' so I'm takin' a risk to drop off two
Niggas gon' keep forgetting about who-
Keys in my lap, just in case these niggas stangin'
Niggas gon' keep forgetting about who goddamn-
Started this muhfuckin' new wave shit, bruh
I'm scrapped, bitch don't trip
'Cause I'm equipped with that pistol grip
Come on, man, give my respect, bitch

Yeah, smokin' like hickory (Hick)
Stay with the stick for the trickery (Stick)
Pay my respect to keep taking the victories
Freddy went missin', that shit was a mystery
Caught me a vibe, yeah a negative energy
Don't be upset that I called you a mini-me
Keep me a Uzi, that shit be the minigun
Hunnid round clips, pop it right in the Tommy gun
My niggas shoot, they don't do the octagon, yup
Spider drop out like Decepticon (Bitch)
Right at your crib while you're eatin' dinner (Bah)
Dressed in a mask like it's Comic-Con (Ho)
Twelve came in the hotel room (Hoo)
I like to sleep at the Palms (Shit)
Nut fill up to her gums (Shit)
All in her stomach like TUMS (Shit)
Rollin' in my pimpin', ain't no tellin' what I'm finna do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I said what I said nigga
My beeper just a-beepin' so I'm takin' a risk to drop off two
And I'm a eight-figure, muhfuckin' twenty-one year old millionaire
Ain't got no kids either
Keys in my lap, just in case these niggas stangin'
Ain't no bitch gon' trick me out my dollar
I'm scrapped, bitch don't trip
'Cause I'm equipped with that pistol grip
Ain't takin' care of none of these dry-hair bitches with kids, nigga5Embed
