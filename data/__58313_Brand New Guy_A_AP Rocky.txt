Yeah, I came with a blick, I just brought the fire
(Senk, pop it up)
I can't fuck with none of these lames, they a fuckin' lie
(Sonic Boom)
Blatt, bih', blatt, hold up
Racks, I got racks (Yeah)
Money in my pants make me sag (Yeah)
My bitch on my dick, she got me mad (Yeah)
I pull Glock 9s and I blast (Blatt, blatt, hol' up)

I got Black Flag on my ass, hol' up (Black Flag)
Shawty wanna fuck on Carti 'cause he got cash (He got cash)
I got Chrome Hearts (I got Chrome Heart)
