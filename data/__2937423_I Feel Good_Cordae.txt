8 ContributorsI Feel Good Lyrics
Yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, listen

I'm feeling good today
Top down, roof missing in the hood today
To the party ain't no way that I wouldn't stay
So hard fuck niggas just couldn't hate
Damn, how the fuck I'm so full of joy?
Got problems most people hope would avoid
But I'm chilling real hard at the ocean views
Even though most a nigga bills overdue
Don't give a fuck, dog, I cop clothes and shoes
Wearing fly shit that most bad hoes would choose
Took his girl, now this nigga bout to blow a fuse
I don't even take it serious, I'm so amused
Why stress over life? It's a beautiful day
Not to mention God blessed with my musical ways
Always have good energy the Buddha would say
'Cause most problems escalade uprooted from hate
I mean...

Problems solved, I feel today
No stress, no strain 'cause feel good today
It ain't no way I should good today
But I feel so good today
Problems solved, I feel today
No stress, no strain 'cause feel good today
It ain't no way I should good today
But I feel so good today
You might also like
I'm feeling pretty good right now
And with every word that I write down my mood'll improve
Usually the musical move all the views from my room
And the Buddha and the tunes is what I choose to consume
Review what I've  and you could see I know what it takes
I never took breaks, moving while the 
Just tryna create, manifest the vision and shit
And gettin' quick wasn't in it, I just did it for kicks
Now this shit is legit, I'm feeling pretty good about it
And they shouldn't doubt it
I said really though, they shouldn't doubt it
I came a long way from  Montana 
Now there's ash stains on my Vineyard Vines
And you can get it all online
Google , you know that it's all mine
And I know that they're starting to feel the hype now
So I guess I'm feeling pretty good right

Problems solved, I feel today
No stress, no strain 'cause feel good today
It ain't no way I should good today
But I feel so good today
Problems solved, I feel today
No stress, no strain 'cause feel good today
It ain't no way I should good today
But I feel so good today, yeah1Embed
