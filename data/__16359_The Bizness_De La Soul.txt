56 ContributorsThe Bizness Lyrics
And and bass up the track a little bit
'Cause I'm — I wanna hear that woom sss-ch woom, knowhatI'msayin?
Yeah yeah, you know the bizness, Common Sense
Soul with the De La
Forget all them playas
We the rhyme-sayers
Huh, and that's the bizness, hah
Gon' do it like this
Gettin' it hot, like the Chicago streets

I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high
Always exhale the facts 'cause I don't inhale la/lie
Play the greater man's game to bounce off my losses
So I can earn the acres (Uhh), the houses (Yeah), the horses (Ha)
Of course it's much greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das
Makin' moves down South, to avoid the chaos
And never, flaunt the coin 'cause dime-getters be gazin'
They call me Luther Van', they say my style is So Amazing (Ha)
I'm fazin' those who're supposed to have the last laughter
'Cause even when I'm gone, I'm reappearin' in the after—
I have to send respects to real money makers
Do not connect us with those champagne-sippin' money fakers
Chase the quarter pound with spice from Chi-town
Now, what that prove? You're so full, you can't even move
You might also like
'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't another brother cook these delicacies
Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun
Uh, and I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink...

Do you wanna be a MC? Or do you wanna serve?
Do you wanna be dope? Or do you wanna deal it?
Fabricated acrylic, I feel it, I'm the style molester
I do a show, get Extra P's like the Large Professor
In fact, I get more hoes than Tessa
Peep game like a refe-ree, in sole control of my desti-ny
In the best of three out of five, whip anybody ass at NBA Live
Rappers take a dive like Greg Louganis with his gay-ass
Rather be in Bebe's alley, than at the Clique with gators
Not a hater of the players, I'm more like a coach, or an owner
I Used To Love H.E.R., but now I bone her (Ahuh-hah!)
At one point in rhyme, I thought I lost my erection
But then I got it back with the Resurrection
Blessings upon rhymes, old man who called him traitor
Big Com-stradamus, niggas styles I predict
I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't no other brother cook these delicacies
Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun

I'm the most from the coast of the Eastern flav'
Droppin' more knowledge than litter on the New York pave'
It's me, Wonder Why, in the place to be
Certified as superior MC
While others explore to make it hardcore
I make it hard for wack MC's to even step inside the door
'Cause these kids is rhymin' sometimin'
And when we get to racin' on the mic, they line up to see
The lyrical killin', with stained egos on the ceilin'
My rhymes escalates like black death rates
Over musical plates, bein' played as the rule
Kids thinkin' steppin' to the Soul, you're labelled fools
Who claims to drop jewels, but for now you do the catchin'
I don't worry on what crew you run
Or what section of earth you reside
You're not even a MAN
So I don't deem it MANdatory takin' your pride
But I will, 'cause my man said Soulful Delight
You cry "Keepin' it real", yet you should try keepin' it right
That's understanding microphone mathematics
Which leads to currency and temporary world status
And when one shows he pose threat to this one
This one will make that one into none
Simple equation, zero! You shouldn't play hero
If you can't stand Strong like the Island I'm from
Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun
Yeah, and I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't another brother cook these delicacies
See, can't another brother cook these delicacies
See, can't another brother cook these delicacies

Ahh, that's how, that's how I'm supposed to do my thing, huh
Like triple it, aight
That's how we do it, all the way from Strong Island to Chicago
The type of freestyler flow
Yeah, it's fluid, it ain't even a flow no mo', hah

Let me tell you a little somethin' about the Self (Tell 'em, Self)
I be a piece of the East Coast
So give a toast to Plug Wonder Why
Back in the day who soaked his words in ginger
So when I ran a phrase in June, you didn't catch it 'til December
I'm a member of them kids from the inner city
Givin' you kiddies audible treats, you be achin' for
Makin' more money than a pagan holiday
Not from the PJ's, yet I still got somethin' to say12Embed
