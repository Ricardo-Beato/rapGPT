3 ContributorsGangsta Movie Lyrics
Listen to the track, bitch!
So, they told me, Dram', get back in the streets (Gangsta Grillz)
Well, look at that
I'm back in the streets
That was easy
Mr. Thanksgiving
Oh, they scared of that
Gangsta Grillz

Gucci Mane and DJ Drama, Drumma Boy, affiliates (Oh)
Gangsta Grillz, you pussy nigga, back on my drug dealer shit (What?)
I bust a brick, it look just like the inside of a coconut (Scalp)
We in our trap house posted up and soldiered up and boted up (Gang)
Your boyfriend shout me eighty bucks, he so fucking slick, my nigga (Pussy)
But I gave him crazy cut, I'm not even trippin', nigga (Die)
Need no Gucci or Achooli, whippin' up our thirty deuces (Skrrt)
East Atlanta, New Jay City, late night, it's a scary movie (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Gangsta Movie how I'm movin', want to see some scary shit
Two niggas tied up together, they cut off, it's very scary
They cut off, it's very scary, they cut off, it's very scary
Chopper, he lil' pimpin and I've seen it looking very scary (Gangsta Grillz, Gangsta Grillz)

I heard motherfuckers going around saying they made Drama
You know what I tell 'em? ''Okay''
''Go make another Drama''
Come on, man, I do this
I been here
Gucci, Drama, now tell that (Gangsta Grillz)You might also likeEmbed
