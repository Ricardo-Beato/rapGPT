41 ContributorsMoments Lyrics
'Bout it, that's how I feel (Jansport J)
We used to all put in and go half on bail money
Fuck makin' it rain, now we makin' it hail money (Hit-Boy)
Yeah

I never met Muhammed Ali, wish I did
My brother saw him, champ told him nothin' is real
Gave me the chills, thought about it, that's how I feel
We on autopilot, no captain behind the wheel
My whole career, I steered away from features
But I figured it's perfect timin' to embrace new leaders
Accepted my position as the master teacher
I make cash deposits before the first
Flashy diamonds, that's waterworks
Sassy modеls the curviest
Brothers you knеw from the sandbox'll do you the dirtiest
Government assistance, poverty is big business
Overrun the Senate, both parties got policies built for the wicked
Look in the jungle, you gotta move like an animal
Prey on the predators, go where anybody that challenge you
Board rooms, courtrooms, it'll leave you with war wounds
I ain't wanna be this cold hearted but I was forced to
Wore my sneakers like Run-DMC did
Important to black culture like Spike Lee is
He Got Game, I wish my mom could see this
See the man that he is, moments you can't relive
You might also like
Like takin' your first swim
Like still bein' a virgin
Takin' trainin' wheels off the rims
Movin' in ya first crib or having your first kid
Moments you can't relive
(Moments you can't relive, moments you can't relive)
Like your first time buggin' from somethin' that Nas said
(Nas said, Nas said)

Yo, I wish I met Sister Souljah, but I didn't
Woulda told her Coldest Winter Ever was beautifully written
She alive so she'll hear this
I'm dolo, no co-defendants, I been with the social distance
Archbishop of sharp spittin', sports car whippin'
Ya actin' like the real ain't what's needed, of course I get it
What's more authentic? Hit-Boy in a walking Guinness World Record
New York Menace, I'm O-Dog, Hit is Caine, the endin' change
Traded my youth, some say I became a suit
A representative of Martin' dream comin' true
Every man is a King ‘less he make excuses
Wish that my mishaps wasn't a nuisance
Sunday to Sunday, get praise, I'm God made
Where I'm from, one go in the grave, one go in the cage
Moments you can't relive
(Moments you can't relive, moments you can't relive)
Like takin' your first swim
Like still bein' a virgin
Takin' trainin' wheels off the rims
Movin' in ya first crib or having your first kid
Moments you can't relive
(Moments you can't relive, moments you can't relive)
Like your first time buggin' from somethin' that Nas said
(Nas said, Nas said)

Third verse and I knew what to write
They say I'm a legacy artist, I blew up the price
Thirty years later, who woulda knew dude would be nice?
I hit the tables and I threw up the dice
Under the lights, outside dining, al fresco
Silk is the dress code, had to be Esco
Colors of lightbulbs change through voice command
Flew over Antigua, made the choice to land
Set my feet on a private island, house come with a staff
Chef know how to cook with no salt and low fat
Extended stay shorty, she don't wanna go back
You gotta appreciate the moments, bad times don't last
Like my first fistfight in the 'Bridge
Hype like the first time I heard Nobody Beats the Biz
Those times bring me to tears, moments you can't relive
(Moments you can't relive, moments you can't relive) Yeah
Like takin' your first swim (Splash)
Like still bein' a virgin (Splash)
Takin' trainin' wheels off the rims
Movin' in ya first crib or having your first kid (It's a girl)
Moments you can't relive (Moments you can't relive, yeah)
Like your first time buggin' from somethin' that Nas said
(Uh, when was that? Way back)

Just free livin' this life
I can't relive last night
I'm excited for today7Embed
