10 ContributorsWhen I Grow Up Lyrics
The Dogg Pound and the LBC, your baby is awaiting you

That's that damn Snoop Dogg again, he ain't nothin' but a fuckin' pimp!

Man snoop you got a bad car, when I grow up I wanna be just like you!
Look here little homeboy, let me tell you something
Don't let me ever hear you say you wanna be like me
You could be a doctor, a lawyer, a football player, a Laker, anything!
Just don't let me ever hear you say you want to be like me
You hear me?
Yah Huh!
Now take these dollars and go give em to your brothers and sisters! And you run on to school!
Thanks Snoop!You might also likeEmbed
