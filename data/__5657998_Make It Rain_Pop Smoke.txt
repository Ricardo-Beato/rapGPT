Hello, this is a prepaid collect call from Rowdy baby, bitch (Baow)
I got the call behind the wall that it's still lit, then fuck it
I told Fetty go and up it
My niggas ain't talkin', they dumpin'
I treat his face like Busta Rhymes, why you say that? I touch it
Then I threw the grip inside of the toilet with no remorse and flushed it
Why niggas still bluffin? I still haven't seen nothin' (Where he at?)
My chain hang, don't tuck it, I touch down, I'm bustin'
Tell the label I need five M's, if not, I ain't signing nothin'
'Cause I'm on a flight with a Russian, getting head, concussion
And niggas saying that it's lit, real shit, it's nothin'
'Cause I'm in the Wraith with your bitch, gettin' lit, stuntin'
Pole out in any weather, shit on Rowdy, you could never
Go and grab your umbrella, 'cause we make it rain on whoever
Baow, we make it rain on whoever
(Grrt, grrt, baow, baow-baow-baow-baow)
Look, I make it rain on whoever (Uh)
I make it rain, that Woo weather (Grrt, baow)
Bitch, I'm a dog, a blue devil
I got the hoes like Hugh Hefner (Boom, boom)
I make it rain on whoever (Uh)
I make it rain, that Woo weather (Grrt, baow)

I got the hoes like Hugh Hefner26Embed
