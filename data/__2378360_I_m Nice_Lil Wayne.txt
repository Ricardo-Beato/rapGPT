22 ContributorsIâ€™m Nice Lyrics
No Ceilings

Wait a minute
Wait a minute, where you going?
Ain't my business where you going
I just want some before you go and
Wait why you in your feelings when I wanna feel something?
Why you in your purse when I'm tryin' to tell you something?
Why you on your phone after 2 in the morning?
Who the fuck you talking to at 2 in the morning, girl?
I swear I'm with my side bitch baby
'Cause I ain't got time for your main tricks
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
And if the side bitch start acting crazy
I'mma run to the next side bitch
And tell the last bitch "Come chase me, baby"
Yeah, feel like it's over, you know it's over with
You get my feelings and time and shit
I'm in my feelings 'cause it's over
And you know right is right, so come over tonight
Don't want fuss and fight, let's get right
Right now a nigga feeling so nice
And I feel like I owe you something
Let me show you something, girl
And it's gon' be nice
Right now a nigga feeling so nice
Feel like I owe you something
Let me show you something, girl
Yeah, I'm nice, T I'm nice
Yeah, E I'm nice, Hood I'm nice, Steve I'm nice
Hold up, I think these pills give me extra emotions
Hold up, I think they kicking in, I'm going through the motions
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
I feel like celebrating, what you doing? I'm about to come over
Your homegirl there, I really feel like I can take both of 'em
Oh my
Can I ask why
You give me that eye
Every time we Facetime?
That's 'cause you know I
I'mma come back, reply
With "Don't you move a muscle, I'm 'bout to come by"
Every time, like we on rewind
Back it up, rewind
Like (Missy Elliot Reference)
We fuck on Versace
You watch me
'Cause I got the mirror on top me
And I be just going in like Rocky
That dick got you snoring, I record you, send you a copy
You be so embarrassed, you say don't mock me
And I be like "That's our secret that I keep"
And I feel like pouring some lean in this styr-e
Said I feel like pouring some lean in this styr-e
Hold up
You know I'm the nicest, this dick need a license
But why did you leave me? I swear it's a crisis
If you ever need me, I come quick as lightning
Don't give him no pussy if he cum quick as lightning
Just saw your sis and I got so excited
She tell me you just celebrated sobriety
But you didn't invite me
That's that bullshit, I need a lighter
You should be nicer
Yeah, I swear I'm with my side bitch baby (hold up)
'Cause I ain't got time for your main tricks
Yeah-yeah-yeah (hold up)
But that's OK 'cause I'm nice
Hey Manny, I'm nice
