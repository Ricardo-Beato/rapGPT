Undercover Prodigy
Come on!

Look, I ain't gon' lie to you motherfuckers, I'm bad bidness
I ain't that industry nigga who always ass-kissin'
I got mad disses for anybody who askin' and
Y'all can sit and pout as you watch how high the cash gettin'
And bitch, I made hits, day to day in the basement
Slavin' away, playin' the game, makin' my name fizz
And lowkey I been checkin' to see how Dame is
And without Hop, I'm sorry nigga, you ain't shit
Do somethin', got you goose bumpin'
Who fuckin' with me? I'm rude, rugged and love to intrude ruckus
Too stubborn, I got the motherfuckin' juice chuggin'
You think you runnin' shit but you really my cute puppet
Just danglin' from a string, I was made to disrupt the peace
Don't care if you poppin', bitch, you basic as fuck to me
I've been labeled a fuckin' beast, it's a fatal corrupt disease
Don't be callin' tryna sit for a bagel and cup of tea, my nigga

Ooh, you don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Fuck around and break you all proper
You gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (Sangoma)
Nigga, peep game, no shame, I won't ever change
You don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Savage!
You might also like
I'm the dirty scoundrel, livin' life on the down-low
I've been to Hell, I sat with the man of the household
My heart froze, but you don't wanna know how cold
I feel like the one, but I ain't what you should count on
Buckle up, nigga! Have a blast, I'm an avalanche
Mashin' fans down on your master plan with a planned attack
It's like a massive pack of elephants, charge you with cataracts
So call an ambulance, I'm the straw that just broke the camel's back
You don't want problems, I'm serious, I am too sick (Yeah, yeah)
I promise I ain't delirious, I can prove it (Yeah, yeah)
Think twice, nigga, I'm eerie as Tyson's toothpick
Undercover Prodigy, visualize the movement, nigga
This is a brand new side of me that's emergin'
Evil and purgin', I am more deceivin' in person
Screamin' and cursin', fuck the world with penis insertions
I'ma feel this way until the day I'm leavin' this Earth, man

Ooh, you don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Fuck around and break you all proper
You gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (Sangoma)
Nigga, peep game, no shame, I won't ever change
You don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Savage!

Listen, I ain't gon' pretend to be the best
I don't give a fuck about ever bein' politically correct
Look at the fans that all my misery has blessed
As long as I'm breathin' I ain't gon' give emcees a rest
Music can make a struggle seem cool — it's not
Do you know what the fuck I've been through? A lot
There is an evil me that speaks to me every evening
I tried to get rid of him but he rules my thoughts

Ooh, you don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Fuck around and break you all proper
You gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (Sangoma)
Nigga, peep game, no shame, I won't ever change
You don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Slow down, nigga!
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Soek jy ‘n sangoma? Soek jy ‘n sangoma? A sangoma?
