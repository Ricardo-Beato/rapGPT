36 ContributorsSame Guy Lyrics
Ooh, yeah

I can't keep lettin' shit slide
Thought that I would change, but I'm the same guy
Blamed it on my youth, but I know I've had time (Ooh)
Now when it comes to you and I, all that I ever did was tell lies
Am I gon' keep this up 'til I die? (Oh, oh)

Does it add up when you do the bad stuff? Mm-mm
Time keeps movin' past us
If they gon' shoot, then I pray they end up shootin' past us
Temptations that I knew to pass up, but I didn't
When I said I loved you, know I really thought I meant it
Can I go to Heaven? Is it time to put my bid in?
I'm no longer a kid, I should probably quit the kiddin'
And the playin'
I wanna do the right thing, man, that's all I'm sayin'
I can't keep blamin' entertainment
And the money and thе fame that I been attainin' (Ooh)
There's a rеason for these girls that I'm entertainin'

I can't keep lettin' shit slide (Can't keep lettin' shit slide)
Thought that I would change, but I'm the same guy
Blamed it on my youth, but I know I've had time (Had time)
Now when it comes to you and I (Ooh), all that I ever did was tell lies
Am I gon' keep this up 'til I die? (Up 'til I die)
You might also like
These are my confessions, couldn't say it to you
So that's why I booked this session
The company I kept and I slept with
Kept me from bein' all alone with my reflection
Trust me, now I know that you a blessin'
All these white lies are growin' to life-size
I don't wanna split, but I know it's the right time
You don't wanna look, but you know there's a bright side
If you got a feelin' like mine, sing it like

I can't keep lettin' shit slide
Thought that I would change, but I'm the same guy
Blamed it on my youth, but I know I've had time (Had time)
Now when it comes to you and I (Ooh), all that I ever did was tell lies
Am I gon' keep this up 'til I die? (Up 'til I die)

Ooh, ooh (Hey, ooh, up 'til I die)
Ooh, ooh (Oh-oh, yeah)
Ah, ah, ah (Oh)
Ah, ah, ah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, oh Lord, Jetson made another one
Ah, ah, ah, ooh Lord, Jetson made another one
Ooh (Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah)
Oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)4Embed
