I'm on your block with money on top
Black Lives Matter, what's up with these cops?
I'm spittin' this fire, I do not expire
Just pass me the lighter and we not gon' stop
They callin' me Freddy, you know I'm the Krueger
Teachin' these classes like I am a tutor
Got too much girls, I'm callin' them hooters
Kobe, number eight
Most of these girls, they just want the fame
If he just want money then get out my lane (Ching, ching)
These vibes are so crazy, I'm goin' insane
I pull up to school and you know I ain't late
They call me "Lil' psychic," got medium fade
I see that you're nervous, I see it in your face
They call me "Almighty," you cannot escape
You cannot escape, you cannot escape (Nope)
Just got a new 'Rari and bought a new Lambo (Skrrt)
Watchin' a movie but it is not Rambo
Killin' this beat, I know you a fan, bro
I know you a fan, bro
I'm not Chinese but pull up with chop-sticks
I'm like La Flame, I'm bringing the mosh pits
I am the villain, no reason to stop this
No reason to stop this
I don't want 'rona but pull up with soap (Corona)
I am so great that they call me the G.O.A.T
I pray to God that I get a blessing
I am young grinder, no need for resting
My name is Dwayne, put respect on that
Gettin' this money, I stack up racks (Racks)
These rappers in my lane, I spit facts
Your breath stink, need some Tic Tacs (Tic Tac)
You might also like
They call me "Lil Tune" but I go by, "Tunie"
No Netflix and chill, I'm watchin' a movie
I'm wearing no Nike, I'm rockin' that Gucci
That boy, he a fraud, he wearin' that Fucci

Y'all think that I'm playin'
I'ma go crazy, might go Super Saiyan
I'ma take your girl, I mean, I'm just sayin'
Hands together 'cause we gon' start prayin' (Amen)

I'm spitting this heat
Boy, I bought them shoes on your feet
Y'all needa listen, so take a seat
They "Rest in paradise", that's R.I.P
The legend direction above me
That dude is a joke, I call him "Dummy"
I laugh at him 'cause he look funny
My money bouncin', it bounce like a bunny, ayy, ayy
I'm goin' crazy, I work all day, you can't call me lazy
I'm not a Blood but I'ma go brazy
Don't look at my ice, your mind might get hazy
I take your girl, I'm leavin' you sad
If I take your girl, you finna be mad
She told her mom, her mama was glad
Shout out Lil Wayne, yeah, that's my dad (Lil Tunechi)
They call me "Lil Tune" but I go by, "Tunie"
No Netflix and chill, I'm watchin' a movie
I'm wearing no Nike, I'm rockin' that Gucci
That boy, he a fraud, he wearin' that Fucci
They call me "Lil Tune" but I go by, "Tunie"
No Netflix and chill, I'm watchin' a movie
I'm wearing no Nike, I'm rockin' that Gucci
That boy, he a fraud, he wearin' that Fucci

Think that I'm playin'
I'ma go crazy, might go Super Saiyan
I'ma take your girl, I mean, I'm just sayin'
Hands together 'cause we gon' start prayin' (Amen)
Y'all that I'm playin'
I'ma go crazy, might go Super Saiyan
I'ma take your girl, I mean, I'm just sayin'
Hands together 'cause we gon' start prayin' (Amen, yeah, yeah)

The legendary, the icon, the best rapper alive
Weezy, Lil Wayne
