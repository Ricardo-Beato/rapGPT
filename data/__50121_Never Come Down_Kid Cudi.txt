27 ContributorsNever Come Down Lyrics
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
I tap dance on the clouds

Yeah, I keep it plainer than Pat, dog
So plain it's almost like I don't even rap, yo
Mack load, with flame from a spawning of hauntings that aren't me
Even with my damn eyes open
Yeah, it's like my own never never land
Smokin' on kush, from a bush you'll never touch
Being approached by hoes before you couldn't fuck
And all they wanna know if you be down (you be down)
If you really understand what happen from point A
What, hey, how you doing it wasn't even enough
To escape but I can't go
See I dream on and I'm over the peons
While I be doin' the beyond the
Hatin' niggas be puzzled like how did he get on?
See, I did not dare perform with that coolery
So ante like nothing else matters
Walkin' with a spirit so tattered
You might also like
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
I tap dance on the clouds

New type of warrior
Modern day hippie if I get enough sticky
And if you don't get it I'll explain it to you simply
And iffy iffy, then homie probably never get me
Nothin' really special about lil' ol' Cudder
Except the fact I'd slit my own throat for my mother
If it could make it stress free and then my brother could sacrifice
A meal best served raw with a little steak sauce
Oh no, I bet you probably think I'm looney tune
After big big country bought an album from a leak through
He was cool but just seems some type whatchamacall
Other worldly, but I'm more of a worldly other
Sucker niggas like to state they undercover
But I'll peep ya, I'll see you from my cloud sanctuary
And there's something about Mary
She made me un-tame
There was issues way before I smoked the phillies
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
I tap dance on the clouds

Expedited for you so homie run to it
We makin' the damn dough, who knew it
And everybody in the game with the same ol'
No-no's I'll be doin' it, but Cudi from a different mode
You can keep it goin' though, no I will never slow
Ol' girl want purp, she is silly, yo
I ain't trippin', I'm skippin' while I'm sippin' in
While I go in though (again and again)
Tell them motherfuckin' let somebody tell new ones
If you get high still strive to be someone
I am not a role model but I am the blueprint
Superstar concerts and honors when I spit
Only can be me, Scott, no one can do it, K
Only, I don't mean to be, I do it the CuDi way
No need to be mad if you not me
Lookin' for ill shit, you know where to find KC
Yeah, you know where to find KC
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
I tap dance on the clouds5Embed
