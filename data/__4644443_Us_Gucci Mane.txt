11 ContributorsUs Lyrics
Hah, Wop
Yeah, it's Gucci
Guwop
Huh (Wizzop)
Woah, Kenny

Lemonade convertible, I flushed it to the motorboat
You don’t want this type of smoke, this shit here worse than smoking dope
Drew a line and pick us out, I did that a long time ago
Can't come outside or press rewind, some words are unretractable
Heard you 'bout that action, captain, what the fuck you cappin’ for?
I see through the fake bravado, boy, you mad your money low
Glacier Gang got stupid dough, your CEO is super poor
Y'all niggas some actors, but my chopper can flip tractors, so

It's us over them, we kill 'em with the M's
It's us over them, like we don't even see 'em
It’s us over them, yeah, we just made a film
It’s us over them, we ballin', broke the rim
It’s us over them, and that's just what it is
It's us over them, like we don't even see ’em
It's us over them, we kill 'em with them M's
It's us over them, and that's just what it is
You might also like
Coupe low to the earth, touching the turf
Thug to my core but they calling me sir
Phantom is ready, it came with a fur
Emerald cut watch, yeah, it came with a blur
Some locals in here and some jokers in here
My chef always near, it's no smoking, my dear
I'm missin' my deal, missin' a lil'
Done with you niggas, I'm keepin' it real
Stealing ideas, ride on my Lears
I'ma kick back and lay back at the crib
Ten of the mid, makin' it big
MTV cribs, yeah, we makin' 'em dig
Sleep with the SIG 'cause he play with the kid
Quick on the draw like I'm Billy the Kid
Ice on my neck, got me cold as the fridge
Gucci the GOAT, I stay 'way from the pigs

It's us over them, we kill 'em with the M's
It's us over them, like we don't even see 'em
It's us over them, yeah, we just made a film
It's us over them, we ballin', broke the rim
It's us over them, and that's just what it is
It's us over them, like we don't even see 'em
It's us over them, we kill 'em with them M's
It's us over them, and that's just what it is
