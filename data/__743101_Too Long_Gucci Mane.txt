5 ContributorsToo Long Lyrics
Don't leave her round me too long
Don't leave her round me too long
I have my mind blown: too gone
If you leave her round me too long

Stretching pain out on myself, last night I was whiling out
Took so much damn Ace of Spades, woke up on somebody's couch
Now I'm 'bout to throw a party. Who party right at the house?
Though I smoke at least half an ounce, so many blunts that I lost count
Now I'm wasted, loaded, bitch crazy, drunk, high, landed, rolling
Talking like a loco-motive, tell 'em four pounds' the quota
She hoping going blowing on pussy-ness that's so explosive
House white with steel, ho I'm not a man to show no emotion
I got pornographic pictures in my iPad
Oh that's your bitch? I fucked her, nigga. My bad!
So if you fuck my girl, we'll be even Steven
But the difference 'bout me  Imma keep it pimping

Don't leave her round me too long
Don't leave her round me too long
I have her smoking on that real strong
If you leave her round me too long
You might also like

Back in at the West end, I'm sipping on a Martini
Yellow Lamborghini, 'bout the same color as a zucchini
Last night was a movie, I woke up with three women
Got two chains,two bracelets, she riding me and she getting it
On the fly-ti got a high price, this a lavish life, but I live it
Take your shots right like it's fight night all night long and no twisting
They searched me when I came in, so I came in with three pistols
That jewelry on and my money long, but don't bother me cause I'm chilling
Got three hoes on solo, but trust me no tripping
Ain't acting like I ain't in there, I'm on the stage, I'm tipping
Talk cashier, don't gift it, get dope high, I'm lifted
Sip real lean, that codeine. Who got them prescriptions?
