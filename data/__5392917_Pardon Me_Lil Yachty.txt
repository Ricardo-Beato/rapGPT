Pardon me, I been actin' lil' poor
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, I been actin' lil' poor
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor (EarDrummers)
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, mix the Act' in the store
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, sippin' lean at the store (Mike WiLL, Mike WiLL)
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, sippin' stain at the store
Carbine sittin' on the seat and the floor
Carbine sittin' on the seat and the floor
Barkin', I put that knife on your throat
Torture, I'ma set fire to that ho
Walk in designer, head down to the toe
Name the strip club, I throw it

Hittin' that throat, she a G.O.A.T.
Smashin' that throat, she a G.O.A.T.
Feelin' like an igloo now
Goons ready to hit you now

(Boat)
Bring the big F out the house
Let them fuck niggas know who really get foul
Four hundred thousand right now (Right now)
Four hundred thousand on me right now (Yeah)
Pull up on the scene, tryna hit it right now
I wrap the Bentley in snow (Yeah)
Pull up at the house, she waitin' outside, the lil' bitch is ready to go
Got a Sig Sauer, it's brown like boot
It's still my brother, that nigga the truth, nigga the truth
Twenty-five thousand for eight of my teeth
Three thousand dollars for each every tooth
In too close, pull back the top, shoot out the roof (Brrt), go poof
I'ma start puttin' these bitches on MARTA
I'ma stop puttin' broke hoes on charters
Brother too muddy, he been through too much
If you standin' and talkin', might black out the water
I was twenty years old with six different whips
Perfect good health, but bought ten different scripts (Woo)
Dawg, it's cheaper to boot her out
When niggas be flexin', nah, this ain't the same
Promise it's more for my shit plain
Niggas ain't P's, be lookin' like change
Don't you forget who showed you more
Showed you the life and you thought it was strange
Had the driver pick your ass up from LaGrange
In a black Range, I forgot bad hoes could be lame
You might also like
Pardon me, I been actin' lil' poor (Hoo)
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor (Hoo)
Pardon me, I been actin' lil' poor (Hoo)
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor (Woo)
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, mix the Act' in the store
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, sippin' lean at the store

Pardon me, I'm 'bout to shit on this beat
Pardon me, I just went crazy on a freak
Pardon me, I cook that bon appétit
Pardon me, I bought Chanel for ten G's
Just for the pills and my syrup and my weed
Pull out that Lam', I got somewhere to be
I'm on that, she like
Hit from the back and go deep and go
I'm on that, she on that
We on that, they on that
Crocodile spillin' all over the burp
Bought her a Birk', could've went bought a vert
Sippin' on syrup got my cup turnin' purp'
Pardon me, I got my side bitch on fleek
Swiped out the AP and bought the Philippe
Baguettes on her ankle, she walk so elite
Flex double C's and she with them big B's
Double my cup, man, I'm gone on that E
VVS cut, she done turned to a freak
Drivin' the Rolls and I came out on a key
Play with that drum like I'm Tommy Lee
Count up that money, I might just OD
I took the R out of free, charge a fee
Me and Lil Yachty done caught us a thottie
Pardon me, I been still actin' poor
Pardon me, sippin' stain at the store
Carbine sittin' on the seat and the floor
Carbine sittin' on the seat and the floor
Barkin', I put that knife on your throat
Torture, I'ma set fire to that ho
Walk in designer, head down to the toe
Name the strip club, I throw it

Hittin' that throat, she a G.O.A.T.
Smashin' that throat, she a G.O.A.T.
Feelin' like an igloo now
Goons ready to hit you now12Embed
