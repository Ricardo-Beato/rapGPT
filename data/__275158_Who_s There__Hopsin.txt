I know how
Long you've waited (Waited for what?)
For the day
All these games end

Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P
Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P

Yah (Jarren B-)
A bunch of savages, Hop'll slice the head off a faggot
I wake up in the morning and go raid the medicine cabinet
Every word I spit is murder on the page of this tablet
I spit out a fuckin' bullet from this gauge at your fabric (Blaow)
I'm not your average Joe, brain pattern is slow
A lot of pain, things changed, now I'm stackin' this dope
Exclusive new shit, me and Hopsin, we too sick
I crack a hater upside his fuckin' head with a pool stick
Murderin' me is like Hop signin' to Ruthless
For a second time and then pigs flyin' on broomsticks
Michael Jackson crawlin' out of his grave with two kids (Hee-hee!)
Bitches squirtin' St. Ides liquor out of they two tits
Fuck a metaphor, basically, nigga, you ain't doin' it
Hand you a mirror before I murk you, check out a view in it
I'm losin' it, serial killer lurked in the music biz
Without a mask, I want you bitches to know who the fuck it is
Sufferin' succotash, rims on a hovercraft
Romantic psychopath, I drown whores in a bubble bath
It's Mr. Benton, nigga, y'all fall back
And lick the crease between my asshole and ballsack, bitch! (Ha)

Yo, locked and loaded, ready to bring the ruckus (The ruckus)
Thuggish ruggish, no other rapper can touch it
I'm disgusted, fuck it, now I'm in a rush to put the pressure on
Let it be known, aks your girlfriend who she sextin' on (No, no, no)
Better known as Mister Knock-Knock-The-Panties-Down
You a hand-me-down, Hammer down what they invested on (Like what?)
Shoulda left it alone, shouldn't have left her at home
Them gifts she bought for you, I'm watchin' as she testin' it on (Let 'em know)
My marijuana scent all up in your shit (In your s...)
You ain't shit, you as solid as my spit
I got a couple rappers on my list
Better get established 'fore I get to wrappin' up careers
King Dizzy, comin' to give it to you straight
Take your place, fuck being different, I care about bein' great
Nigga, kill the hate, I'm comin' just to kill it in your state
Fuck the world, fuck you, run in place, I penetrate
We the shit
I know how
Long you've waited (Waited for what?)
For the day
All these games end

Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P
Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P (Yeah)

Bitch, I didn’t wake up in no new Bugatti (Nah)
Just in a room of rotten rappers' gruesome bodies, I’m killin' like I’m illuminati (Woo)
I’m fuckin' out the blue tsunami, nuttin' you can do to stop me
I don’t care if you knew karate or do pilates (Argh)
You fools are probably scattered so gather your stupid posse
And get me before I move to Aussie and they crucify me
Fuck your new Versace, you can get a cut throat
And deep-throat a dick 'til it’s pokin' out through your butthole
Swallow the nut whole, this shit is X-rated
Y'all kept playin’ on devilish ground 'til you met Satan
I stomp on you 'til your chest cave in and neck breakin'
You better be keepin’ your mouth shut like your breath stankin' (Damn)
There really isn't any way I could be less blatant
So face it, you basically fucked, my brain is corrupt
This little bar, I’m raisin' it up, and you can watch me catapult
After you finish lickin' Jarren’s anus and nuts, it’s Knock Madness
I know how
Long you've waited (Waited for what?)
For the day
All these games end

Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P
Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P16Embed
