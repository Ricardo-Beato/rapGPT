51 ContributorsDown Lyrics
Fish is my friends and the whales is my homies
Octopuses my people, the shrimp, they all know me
The sharks is my niggas, the dolphins is with us
The crabs is my comrades, the seahorse be holdin' us down
Jellyfish, they just be rollin’ around
Lobsters is cool, they are not food
They part of the crew
And that mean they down (that mean they down)

Life Aquatic, product of the passage, ooh
Stay there with me, lookin' like Atlantis (ayy)
We're off to build another planet (ayy)
See a ship and then we’re really goin' savage (ayy)
From the home, we was lost in the Atlantic
I wouldn't make it, but we'll find a way to manage (ayy)
Titanic when we're breakin' off the damage
I ain't gotta say it man, that wave is automatic
Me and my partnas, say your life is a beach, no
But life is a beach though
Yeah, it's down here on the sea floor (yeah)
And now we’re really gettin’ deep though
I feel I'm golden (no)
I don’t take shit from no one (no)
I just be floatin'
We're down in the ocean
You might also like
Fish is my friends and the whales is my homies
Octopuses my people, the shrimp, they all know me
The sharks is my niggas, the dolphins is with us
The crabs is my comrades, the seahorse be holdin' us down
Jellyfish, they just be rollin’ around
Lobsters is cool, they are not food
They part of the crew
And that mean they down (that mean they down)
And that mean they down, that mean they down

Throw us in the water, execution
We really thought we wasn't gonna do nothin'
But the sharks and the dolphins gonna do somethin'
Walked up out that water, evolution
Ayy, ayy, revolution
Pass the plate, you should make a contribution
If you ain't got it then you gotta go and get it
Climate change, chain flooded, call it sleepin' with the fishes
Tired of all these bitches, in my net it's just fishes
In my net it's just swishes, boom
And you know I'm a floater, ballin'
Coachin' from the ark, Doc Rivers, call Flipper my nigga
Say you got it for the low (low)
Say you got it by the boat (by the boat)
When you whip it in the water (whip it, whip it)
If it's real, it'll float
Fish is my friends and the whales is my homies
Octopuses my people, the shrimp, they all know me
The sharks is my niggas, the dolphins is with us
The crabs is my comrades, the seahorse be holdin' us down
Jellyfish, they just be rollin' around
Lobsters is cool, they are not food
They part of the crew (they part of the)
And that mean they down (that mean they down)
And down, and down, and that mean they down

One time for my homies at the bottom
Told some lies, keep it real for the bottom
Some of y'all ain't allowed at the bottom
9th Ward, it was down at the bottom
Katrina had it down at the bottom
Pine Ridge, it be feelin' like the bottom
Gaza Strip, baby, tough at the bottom
So you gotta give it up to the bottom
Some only really talk about the top
But I wanna talk about the bottom
I know everything got a lot
But I want them to know that I got 'em, yeah, yeah

Fish is my friends and the whales is my homies
Octopuses my people, the shrimp, they all know me
The sharks is my niggas, the dolphins is with us
The crabs is my comrades, the seahorse be holdin' us down
Jellyfish, they just be rollin' around
Lobsters is cool, they are not food
They part of the crew (they part of the crew)
And that mean they down (that mean they down)
