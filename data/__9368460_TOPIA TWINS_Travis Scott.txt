Twin bitches, twin bitches
Twin bitches hoppin' off a jetski (Yeah)
(Ayy, what we doin'?)
Twin bitches, twin bitches (Yeah)
Twin bitches hoppin' off a jetski (Yeah, yeah)

It's so hard to hide I'm a dawg, nigga, I make a mistake and show it
Way I shoot my shot at all these hoes, I fuck my shoulder up
Travis, what if they twins and they Siamese, but they wanna fuck us both? (Yeah)
Buy her what she want and suck her toes, I'm tryna make her cum
Told her throw it back and put that pussy on me (Yeah)

Told her sit it on this dick, I took the glizzy off me
And you know this life been busy, man, I'm Bizzy, homie
And I come through, throw a pack, she never leave me lonely (Yeah, yeah)
I can't do no cuddles, can't stay 'til the mornin' (Can't stay 'til the mornin')
She an angel in the streets, a demon undercover (Yeah)
Lie to shorty like I hate her, fuck her like I love her (Fuck her like I love her)
I be stuntin' like my daddy, I'm from New Orleans project (From New Orleans project)
Yeah

Sittin' sideways with a drink while I think
Bitches get cold in the summer, keep a mink
Tell me what you doin' for her, better not think
Another nigga do it for her before you blink
Highway movin' right behind me, a fleet
If she get too annoyin', find a beach
Twin bitches, twin bitches
Twin bitches hoppin' off a jetski (Perfect)
You might also like
Twin bitches (21), twin Dracs
Twin Glocks, twin jets (21)
Charter planes, I don't ride prop
Slow stroke (Yeah, perfect) from the back, I been drinkin' Wock'
X-rays, CAT scans, nigga, ask my opps (21)
Ten bad bitches in the studio, they all props (Perfect)
Treat them niggas like rhythmic radio, they all pop
Should've got some lipo', she got shots, now her ass dropped
Slime sittin' in the cell, I bet he comin' home like Pac (On God, perfect)
She give me wet mouth, I need a mop
I don't want that clean head, lil' bitch, I want that slop (21)
She can't bring her phone, ain't no givin' out my drop
Rockin' Lanvins when I step on niggas' blocks (On God)
Need a dealer license, all these cars I done copped
They keep lookin' for her head, but it's goin' down like Joc (21)
Oh, he think he tough? He just actin', he The Rock (Yeah)
Amazon Prime, give me two days, I bet he drop (Pussy)

Sittin' sideways with a drink while I think
Bitches get cold in the summer, keep a mink
Tell me what you doin' for her, better not think
Another nigga do it for her before you blink
Highway movin' right behind me, a fleet
If she get too annoyin', find a beach
Twin bitches, twin bitches
Twin bitches hoppin' off a jetski
It's not electric, this shit gassed up, can you catch it? (Skrrt, skrrt)
The Virgil jetski one of one-fifty, check the leverage (Pussy)
Got two twins, they top tier, that's my favorite fetish
Deep in her throat 'til she tear, I'm her favorite beverage (Straight up)
Ran out of time, made ten APs, man, I can't retire
Been on the road collectin' rubber bands to match attire (Yeah)
I got the vision, ain't no dippin' in that ayahuasca
This shit get thicker than a bitch with stripes, LSU Tigers (Pussy)
Ayy, twin, call up twin, tell her I'm in town now (21)
London bitch, she wanna link, she dropped the pin to pound town (21)
Ass thick, when she walk, it got its own surround sound (Yeah)
And she tryna ride me like a wave, I'ma drown, drown
She say she like the way the soul chop, it make her bounce, bounce (21)
She from the west, but when she with me, she from down south
Flew into town, not to hotel, but to the town house
I send the drop, they hit the drop, we brought the drops out (On God)

Sittin' sideways with a drink while I think
Bitches get cold in the summer, keep a mink
Tell me what you doin' for her, better not think
Another nigga do it for her before you blink (On God)
Highway movin' right behind me, a fleet
If she get too annoyin', find a beach (21)
Twin bitches, twin bitches (Yeah)
