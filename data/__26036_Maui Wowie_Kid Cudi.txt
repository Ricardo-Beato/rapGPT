Goin' back to Honolulu just to get that
That Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu just to get that
That Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high

Yeah, back up in the mix
Aloha nigga, Cudi lookin' for a fix
Got enough dough, just to take a trip
To get a little pinch of the Maui Wowie
Oh man, here we go again
If you ever get a chance, smoke it with a friend
Me and Pat on a mission to get
Lifted like John Legend and shit
Get lifted
Let's get lifted
What you gon' cop?
Maybe a dub, maybe a zone
No matter what you cop, you should smoke it 'til it's gone
Walkin' on the beach with the sand between your feet
And all the Hawaiian girls sing to the beat
"Hey, what it do, boo?
You smoke good? Yeah, me too"
Livin' in paradise, all through the night
And even in the day, smoke 'til I can't see
What can I say?
Nothin' like this in the world homie
Make you feel great, you forget you in the States, might relocate
So you smoke all the Maui Wowie you could take like
You might also like
Goin' back to Honolulu just to get that
That Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu just to get that
That Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high

I know, I know, I know
I really need to go, go, go, go, go, go
Really need to go, go
Really need to go, go, go
Man, I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I know, I know, I know
You really need to go, go
Really need to go, go, go
Man, I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie22Embed
