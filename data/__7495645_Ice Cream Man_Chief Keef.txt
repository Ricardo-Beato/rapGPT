15 ContributorsIce Cream Man Lyrics
Better say bye-bye nicely
Better say bye-bye nicely
Better say bye-bye nicely
Better say bye-bye nicely
Ayy man, ayy man
Take that man, I'm with Tadoe, fuck it
I got ice cream, baby, I know you can see it

Ice Cream Man
Ice Cream Man (Go, know you see me, see that ice cream truck pull up right there)
I got that ice cream, man (Wanna buy ice cream? I'm dealing with the ice cream truck)
Ice Cream Man (Ice cream, ayy)
She told me I taste like ice cream
I made that pussy ice cream
I frost her cakes like icing
And I said bye-bye nicely

So, you wanna fly out next week?
Say we ride in Bentleys?
I’m on defense, can’t offend me
Told that hoe, "God sent me"
Bitch, you gotta accept me
People might come to arrest me
Found me a coupe, baby, let's speed
Ridin’ round town with a lesbi'

Ice Cream Man (Ice cream, ayy)
She told me I taste like ice cream
I made that pussy ice cream
I frost her cakes like icing
And I said bye-bye nicely

'Bout to pull up in the hood
Heard they said they gon’ fight me
And I don’t care if I’m wrong
Ain’t no fuck nigga gon' right me
Choppin’ a Dora backpack
Ain’t nobody gon’ swipe me
You think you a hothead
'Til I melt that shit like ice cream
I got the ice cream
House so big, I fuck on a right wing
They both want an ice cream sandwich
I told ‘em pull up, like McQueen, Lightning
They kung-fu fightin’
And outta nowhere, we start strikin’
You think I got this outta nowhere?
No, I sold ice cream
I might go bikin’
I might climb a mountain, I might go hikin’
I might go strikin’
Said I smell good, she like my hygiene
I might have red eyes
Somebody tell me if I need Visine
Said she like me
Told her, "I like my hoes be feisty"
