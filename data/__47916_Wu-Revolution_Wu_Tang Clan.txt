25 ContributorsWu-Revolution Lyrics
These things just took over me
Just took over my whole body
So I can't even see no more
I'm calling my Black woman a bitch
I'm calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not
I'm lost brother, can you help me
Can you help me brother, please

You see what we did, we lost the love
I'm talking bout the love, the love of your own

But brother, but brother, but brother, check this out
I still don't understand man, I'm all high off this shit man

Well, what I'm trying to say my brother
Why, why do we kill each other?
Look at our children, what kind of a future

This is the training that's gonna be given to you by the Wu
Brothers and sisters
You might also likeThe revolution, the revolution will be televised, televised, televised
It's time to rise, and take our place so we can inherit the universe
The planet Earth belongs to God
This is nineteen-ninety-seven
Every square inch of it that he chose for himself, is the best part
Behind every strong woman you'll find a strong man
And behind every strong man you'll find a strong woman
The universe is not completed without the sun, moon and stars
(Want to be free)
That's man, woman and child
To all you fake-ass niggas who think you gonna survive out here
Without your Black woman, you're wrong
They have attraction powers on the planet
We are original man, the Asiatic Black man
The maker, the author, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization and daughter of the universe
The population was seventeen million, with the two million Indians
Making a total of nineteen million, four billion, four hundred million
All over the planet earth
(Mandela, Mandela)
Arise you Gods, it's the time for the revolutional war
(Malcolm X, Malcolm X)
That's the mental war
That's the battle between God and devil
Take the devil off your plane
Take him off your mental mentality, take him off your brain
Leave all the cigarettes and guns, the alcohol and everything
Thats the mental devil that exists within your body
That's destroying and decaying your mind
The mind controls the body
Everything within must come out
Don't look towards the sky cause there's no heaven above
Don't look down beneath your feet, there's no hell below
But heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you go through
There is only one God
There is a whole new one, faith
There is a only one
One revolution yeah

At one time it was told to me
That man came from monkeys
That we were swinging from trees
I hardly can believe that unless I'm dumb, deaf and blind
You ever heard about, the ape man and the ape woman
You have a mankind, that has a beginning to him
And his ending, is about to come

If you take one step, I will take one with you
Through the storm and pain, swim the deepest sea, with you my brother
I know you got to be strong, gotta hold on

Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our people was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers
They don't know who the true and living God is
And their origins in the world
So they worship what they know not
And they're easily lead in the wrong direction
Ought to be lead in the right
And now you got the ten percent who are rich slave makers of the poor
Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe
That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky
And you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous teachers
Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent
Who is all wise and know who the true and living god is
And teach that the true and living god is a supreme being black man from Asia
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims, and Muslim's sons
Peace we out
I have given it much thought
It seems, disaster must come
At best, only postponed
Shaolin Kung-Fu
To survive must now be taught, to more young men
We must expand, get more pupils
So that the knowledge will spread4Embed
