16 ContributorsHustlaz Ambition Lyrics
Mel Man I see you nigga
Ya, I went And done it, NI
Ya, nigga
Everybody wanna be like Jeezy
Y'all can't be like Jeezy
Look at my watch, look at my wrist
Nuthin' like yo man, he ain't shinin' like this
Nuthin' like yo man, he ain't grindin' like this
And even if he was he ain't fuckin' with cuz

I come so far from the bottom couldn't even see the top
Just as soon as a feel the drought, I'm whippin' up every block
I'm a good God-fearing man with a criminal mind state
Ain't nobody gave a shit and that's why we grind weight
My grandma off in the church while I'm in the refrigerator
In search of the baking soda right next to the mashed potatoes
She prayin' for better days, I'm prayin' it take this water
Realest that done this shit put that there on my mother and daughter

My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla, I won't deny it

It's Mr. Trap or Die, yeah ya'll remember me
First album was a classic, them critics weren't feelin' me
Now as far as award shows, we all know how that goes
So what's all the doubt about, because he ain't sellin' out?
Because he ain't givin' up, because he don't give a fuck
Because he ain't changing' up, I guess he ain't lame enough
And just know I'm savin' up, let you play with my sanity
Gives a fuck what you think of me, unless you feedin' my family
Motherfuck all my enemies, watch out for my mini me's
Listen to these niggas, I bet you hear plenty me
I'm who they pretend to be, do what they pretend to do
See me I'm a hustla, I do what my hustlaz do

My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla, I won't deny it

Might not just be the best, just know I plan to be
I refuse to let suckas win but that's just the man in me
Look it could be the G in me these niggas ain't seein' me
Unless they seein me in traffic in sumthin' topless and drastic
I say I grind like there's 10 of me I swear to god there's just one of me
Look I know I ain't there yet just know that I'm gonna be
I couldn't wait to see the day I could change where my momma stay
I put the B.S. behind me, there's too much money in front of me
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla, I won't deny itEmbed
