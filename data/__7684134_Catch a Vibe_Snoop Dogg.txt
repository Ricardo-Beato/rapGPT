12 ContributorsCatch a Vibe Lyrics
I don't know them niggas
Nigga, why don't you roll up there with me?
Nigga, quit actin' scary
If we both go up there, it's gon' look like somethin' up
Now you know niggas get real paranoid when they see a gang of motherfuckers walkin' up

Now this legendary shit is brought to you by
The D-O-double-G, twenty years of luxury
20 Crippin', fuck with me, east side hustler
Plus a cold motherfucker, you can't get enough of me
Ultramagnetic, these bitches gon' spread it for me
Chain lookin' sleepy, diamonds all embedded
Party poppin' like it's Beat Street, everybody lit
Everybody gettin' ready, summertime about to hit again
California's the spot (Spot)
I'm worldwide whether you like it or not (Not), hop in the whip (Whip)
Drop it and dip (Dip), top of the mornin', I'm out with a bitch
I'm in these streets clockin' a grip (Money)
I'm never gon' slip, never gon' fall off, grab that sawed-off
Everything above your neck (Baow), I blow that all off
You ain't in my bracket (Bracket) or my status quo
Snoop Dogg in the party with the baddest ho, let's go (Let's go)

Cruisin' down the 405 (405), yes
Take a break to catch a vibe (Catch a vibe)
Summertime I come alive (Come alive)
Happy, catch a vibe (Vibe), catch a vibe (Vibe)
Cruisin' down the 405 (405), yes
Take a break to catch a vibe (Catch a vibe)
Summertime I come alive (Come alive)
Happy, catch a vibe (Vibe), catch a vibe (Vibe)

Take a puff, flip the page, continue the story
I control the big stage, got fame and the glory
Money in the bank, from the streets to the business suites
From the Beach to executive meetings, more money, two million this week, nigga
From a street killer to a multi-million dollar weed dealer
Homies told you don't bring the bitch, Doggy Dogg might leave with her
The breadwinner (The breadwinner), I'm so rich and I'm never bitter
Runnin' game like a treadmill, cold nigga, big winner
Cruisin' down the 405, choose a place, yours or mine
We can make this legal paper, no need to read between the lines
Now we talkin' stocks and bonds, NFTs and cryptos
The money profit crackin', so to the bank a Crip go
I'm all about investments, I'm all your homies' reference
My boss moves on the top news, Snoop Dogg, he do not lose
The homie built a new franchise, needed one million, so I dropped two
Showed the nigga what the guap do when I stop through and I pop through and I got you

Cruisin' down the 405 (405), yes
Take a break to catch a vibe (Catch a vibe)
Summertime I come alive (Come alive)
Happy, catch a vibe (Vibe), catch a vibe (Vibe)
Cruisin' down the 405 (405), yes
Take a break to catch a vibe (Catch a vibe)
Summertime I come alive (Come alive)
Happy, catch a vibe (Vibe), catch a vibe (Vibe)Embed
