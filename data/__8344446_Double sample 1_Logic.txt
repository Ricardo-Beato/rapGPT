Just thirty miles from Detroit—from Detroit
Just thirty miles—, just thirty miles—
Just thirty miles from Detroit—from Detroit
Just thirty miles—, the city sleeps
Take this night as the city sleeps, from Detroit
Just thirty miles from Detroit—, just—, just—
Just thirty miles from Detroit
Just thirty miles from Detroit
There stands a giant power station
It ticks each night as the city sleeps
It stands out on a highway
It stands out on a highway, out, out, out
It stands out

It'll all be over, mm
It'll all be over
It'll all be over
And we won't have to cry no more
And we, we won't have to cry no more
You see God's gon' wipe away all our tears
He gon' wipe the tеars
He gon' wipe the tеars from your eyes
Do you hear me up there
Now if you can just hold on
Hold on a little while longer
'Cause one of these old days, one of these old days
But I wanna let you know this evenin', yeah
I wanna let you know
Mm
Mm
