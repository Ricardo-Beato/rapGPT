So excited for... so what're you recording?
It's a new song, I'ma let you hear a little bit
Play it

Well this is why-a-why-a-why
Well this is why-a-why-a-why
Well this is why-a-why-a-why

Who you loyal to? Me or us?
Who you trust the most? Me or us?
Who you wanna fuck every night? Me or us?
Who you wanna take on your flight? Me or us?

Ow!
You the one that said you were doin' it
And you said you were doin' it, you're doin' it, you're doin' it
You say that what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'
You told me that what, what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'
What would you do?
If your brother left you, what would you do?
If them niggas came for you, you better pursue (Watch out)
I just spent ten racks on a dog from Germany, no Purdue
Oops, I meant Dupri, jewelry sitting on A/C
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna know, tell me lil' baby, I wanna know
I wanna know
I got the show, fuck my show, be my show (What)
I got them loafs, I'm with Metro, he got some more (Yeah)
I don't gotta talk, look at my jewelry, it can say more, hey
You smoke that kushy, man I'm so goody, I want some cookies
Fuck on your daughter, fuck on my brother, now she gon' diss you
I got them racks, I was just buyin', you was just lookin'
I bought her diamonds and she just smilin', she think she's tooken
But, this for the love of my fans
I'm smokin' pot while in Japan
Blacker the berry, drink my cran
Bae you dig it and I'm the sand (Dig)
