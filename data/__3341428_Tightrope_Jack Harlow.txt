Tightrope
All of this shit, off the top rope
Praying we land, I got high hopes
Know where we going, just drive slow
Knew she the one, she brought 5 more
We heading right to the condo
Speeding, just look at the console
Ending the night like it's bravo

Got me got me
I need options
Pizza vert
No toppings
Follow me, follow me
I'm on island
I got fantasy
Need therapy
Probably
I need better things
Recipe
Currency
Don't mean much, guess we'll see
Fairy tale making ends meet
Find the time as I dig deep
Got that shit out my system
All this shit, off my ribs feel
This episode need a re-run
How you feel, how you feel
YSL you can tell
If she ain't naked, I don't care
Late night in her feels
I be back I don't care
Blow it all that's a risk
How you feel, how you feel
Could give a fuck about the shit
My bitch sidekick
Steering wheel vice grip
Good brain ideas
All I wrote type shit
You might also like
Tightrope
All of this shit, off the top rope
Praying we land, I got high hopes
Know where we going, just drive slow
Knew she the one, she brought 5 more
We heading right to the condo
Speeding, just look at the console
Ending the night like it's bravo
Tightrope
All of this shit, off the top rope
Praying we land, I got high hopes
Know where we going, just drive slow
Knew she the one, she brought 5 more
We heading right to the condo
Speeding, just look at the console
Ending the night like it's bravo

Momma called
Asked me if it's worth it to me
I’ll be honest, not at all
This ain't what I thought it was
I guess don't get me wrong, I know I'm blessed
Sometimes I'm tempted just to hit that fucking ganja for the stress, but
I make that pussy my getaway vehicle
She give it up, but she wish I was dateable
I don't say much when I notice the pain on her face
It reminds me of kids I would see in school
Empathy coming in waves
Then it just tends to be something that fades
Me, I been searching for something that lasts
Don't want no remedy numbing the pain
Told me her wrist is in love with the blade
Damn, I wish there was something I could say
I know this life doesn't come with a key
I know the kitchen don't come with a maid
I got the hits they be wanting to play
Fuck with the vision is what they gon’ say
Whether it's positive or that shits negative
Bet they go mention my mothafuckin’ name
Momma called
Asked me if it's worth it to me
I’ll be honest, not at all
This ain't what I thought it was
I guess don't get me wrong, I know I'm blessed
Sometimes I'm tempted just to hit that fucking ganja for the stress, but
Tightrope
All of this shit, off the top rope
Praying we land, I got high hopes
Know where we going, just drive slow
Knew she the one, she brought 5 more
We heading right to the condo
Speeding, just look at the console
Ending the night like it's bravo

Ending the night like it's bravoEmbed
