Mm-mm, mm-mm, uh

Strong spirit where the body couldn't get asylum
The cost of living high, don't cross the picket line and get the virus
Wild cat has got 'em in a bind, stay inside
Know I came from out the thicket smilin'
Mad hatters cappin' every line
It doesn't matter to the ten of five
They start hackin' when they can't shrink us
I found the middle in a bit of balance
Fever in the cabin
I knew where we was headed
I ain't countin' no blessings, I sure as shit could measurе
Blinkin' for some feasible mеthods to free yourself
Split it with my hand like cigarill's
Slick oil in a fish' gill
I fill a void with the pen, feel the fear, shrill
Couple stains that I couldn't shield
My brother, Brain, that we couldn't shield
Couple came, couple went still
And what remain of the wolves, nil
I held the page, gave the book ears
Whispered "Thanks", hella pain, heavy rain in the Catskills
Played the shade, quite a deal, glad we stayed friendsYou might also like7Embed
