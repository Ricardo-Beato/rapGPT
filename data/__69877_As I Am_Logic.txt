40 ContributorsAs I Am Lyrics
Alright, run it
I know what it's like
To be all, all depressed
And not wanna go out and
And live life man
That's not healthy man
You can't be living like that, what's wrong with you?
Hi
Yeah, hey you, yeah you
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
I know you been feeling down
There's— something's pissing you off
And something's wrong— you know what
We're gonna— I'm gonna cheer you up
I'm gonna help you out
Just go ahead and just
And just listen alright?
Here we go

Hi there, hey friend, how are you
Cheer on up, you superstar, you
Don't let them try you
Fuck that shit, don't let them deny you
'Cause you're gonna make it some day
And you're gonna make it some way
No more waitin’ for the bus
And no more riding on the subway
Live life how you want to
So get on up, now, go get out there
Face your fears, no need to be scared
You better rebel
And if they hate you, give 'em hell
No more hiding in your shell
'Cause we are not defined
By how hard we fall
So, dust yourself off and stand tall
‘Cause you can make it
Of this, I’m sure
Just spread your wings and you will soar
You might also like
I know
I know, know that I'm gonna blow
You away
And when I wake up
I'm gonna shake up the fuckin' world
And you're gonna love me
You're gonna take me as I am (as I am)
And not a single one of you can tell me no
Ohh, yeah

I'ma go where nobody before me has gone
And I know that the journey is gonna be long
Livin' life like a mademan like a don
I was in the dark but now all the lights on
It's real hard on the rise to fame
Cause everybody's mad and you're the one to blame
And just last year you didn't know my name - Logic
Now they all demand it
Used to hate me and I can't stand it
'Cause now you love me you so damn manic
Said I'll never make it said I'll fail
My ship would sink
But motherfucker I sailed
I know I'm gonna prevail
Eyes on the prize right on my trail
Middle finger to the haters that are on my tail
'Cause I got heart boy I got spunk
Feelin' just like Jordan before the dunk
And if you fuck around I'ma put you in the trunk
Ha, I'm just playin around
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)
Oow
I know
I know, know that I'm gonna blow
You away
And when I wake up
I'm gonna shake up the fuckin' world
And you're gonna love me
You're gonna take me as I am (as I am)
And not a single one of you can tell me no
Ohh, yeah

I swear to God that I love the life I live
And I'm grateful for every breath it gives
I remember thinkin' something's gotta give
New day but it all just feels the same
No clouds but I can feel the rain
Pointin' fingers lookin' for someone to blame (lookin' for someone to blame)
'Til I came across my own name
I wasn't in control of my destiny
Feelin' empty thinkin "Where's the rest of me?"
I gotta make it but I need the recipe
Only then will I find the best of me
I didn't wanna listen, didn't give a fuck
I was so selfish, I was so stuck
Cleanin' up food, for a little buck
Then I quit that, livin' on luck
I was so lost, at what cost?
Why be the worker when you could be the boss?
Still doin' wrong, tryna live right
Get my mind righteous, man, what a fight
Shit gettin' tight, man that ain't right
And my girl left, so I just might
So I just might
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and the
Happiness last, and the
Haters kiss my ass
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and the
Happiness last, and the
Haters kiss my ass12Embed
