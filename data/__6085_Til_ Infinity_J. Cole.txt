Uh, yea
Let me warm up man, let me warm up man!
I got to warm up man!
Yea, Elite what up! Yeah Warm Up
Yeah, look

Niggas wanna know the formula for success
Shit, but I studied for this test
Ay nigga I'm better than the rest you just rest, boy please
Me I'm tryna stretch my treasure chest, like some double D breasts
So a nigga on a quest, no question
So I tell em birds no nesting
Laying in my bed, hope to lay a niggas egg
No, you'll never hatch mines
Baby, you don't match mines
I'm trynna shine like the bat sign, when it's crime
And the gats flyin up in Gotham, watch em
Far from a thug but I'll drop one
Far from a scrub but I'll mop em
Watch 'em better leave 'em alone like Stockton, when he retired
Shit, your shit is fire, boy stop
I don't buy it, boycott, stop lying
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying
It's not rocket science
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants, ha
A little line to show love to the city that got no love
Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold up
That's cold-blooded, well never to fail
If you can make it here, you can make it from heaven or hell
I'm just a little nigga straight out the Ville
Always been sick probably never get well
And no time soon, step to a nigga get 4 times 2
Bet the way I spit it leave your mind blew, with more rhymes due
Nigga you tryning who?
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you tryna be
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you tryna be
Look, it's no time to chill, I'm tryna get Mills
There's no time to chill, I'm tryna build
Bitch there's no time to chill, I'm tryna get Mills
There's no time to chill, I'm tryna build
Bitch there's no time to chill, I'm tryna get Mills
There's no time to chill, I'm tryna build
Bitch there's no time to chill I'm tryna get Mills
There's no time to chill nigga, yeahYou might also like2Embed
