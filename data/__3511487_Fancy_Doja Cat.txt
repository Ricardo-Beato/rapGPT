All my fellas, they be actin' jealous
They don't understand me, prolly cause I'm fancy, ooh, ooh
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohh
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohh
You would think I'm royal, baby look so spoiled
Mommy brush this dirt off, like I own this soil
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohh
Prolly cause I'm fancy, uh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ohh

Yuh, prolly how I come across
Honey if you pay, I talk (I talk)
Prolly love the way I floss (I)
Make you feel a type of way
Fuck 'bout what you say though
Never miss a meal like Ross
'Bout to flip a mil like Ross, ayy
They don't know me 'hind closed doors, ayy
You could never find me lost, and I bet you the boss
But baby I'm bosser
Used to be daughter, they call me mother now
Treatin' me like no other
Swag underwater, bread in the butter now
Wallet, wallet in pocket, pocket
Give five to the valet and she park it, park it
No games but I'm ballin', call it crocket, crocket
I'm a target but I never shop at Target, got it?
