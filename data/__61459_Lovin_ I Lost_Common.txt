26 ContributorsLovinâ€™ I Lost Lyrics
I remember, I remember, I remember
(It happens to the best)
(So I loved and I lost)
I remember, I remember, I remember

I remember she sit there with her thickness
Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is "gonna get'cha"
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, God be with us
It was hard for me to take down the pictures
I was tripping, I even called her sister
I could be someone you could talk to each and every day
But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
'Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love, huh, just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

I remember, I remember, I remember
(It happens to the best)
(So I loved and I lost)
I remember, I remember, I remember, yeah
You might also like
Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had, some say it come from not seeing my dad
Keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up
On you and us
I tried to take it day by day and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life, huh
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya
I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest
So confusing losing love, I'm saying god bless
Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

I remember, I remember, I remember
(It happens to the best)
(So I loved and I lost)
I remember, I remember, I remember, yeah
(Loved and I lost)
(It happens to the best)
(So I loved and I lost)
(And I might as well confess)3Embed
