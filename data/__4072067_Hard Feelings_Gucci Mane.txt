14 ContributorsHard Feelings Lyrics
Southside on the track, yeah
Evil Genius
Gucci season
Wizop
Brrr! Brrr! Haha
Guwop, wizop
Go!

These hoes ain't worth a nickel (Nah)
Feelings get real fickle (Hah)
Some hoes you got to pimp 'em
Some you show favoritism (Muah)
Guwop got money, honey
Too rich for TV, Jonny
But I need you urgently (Come)
Come quickly, hurry please (Now)
She see me, think it's Christmas (Huh)
Filled out like Wendy Williams (Wow)
On fleek she look Brazilian (Fleek)
Drop top with tinted window (Guwop)
Love when she call me papi
Guess I know how to pick 'em
Even when I was fat
Think I invented drippin'
You might also like
I broke so many hearts
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelings
I broke so many hearts
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
I broke so many hearts
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelings

Sweet and tender
Fender bender, now she vex
Fighting and fucking
Kissing, suck me on my jet (Nyoom)
My life is public
My life's complex but it's no stress
I told her fuck it (Yeah)
It ain't no budget 'cause I'm blessed (Guwop)
My ex still stalk me
And we done broke up in '96
Why he down talk me?
Guess he can't deal with my success (What)
Why you keep trollin'?
And I act like you don't exist (Uh huh)
My heart was golden
But now it's frozen with Baguettes (Yeah)
I broke so many hearts
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelings
I broke so many hearts
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
I broke so many hearts
Hope it's no hard feelings (No hard feelings, hard feelings, hard feelings)
Hope it's no hard feelingsEmbed
