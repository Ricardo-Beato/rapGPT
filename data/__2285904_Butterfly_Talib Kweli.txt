Yeah. You know. Make it work
Summer rain is like my ad-lips???
???
Right Chris?
(sound like)
Extra precautions when they not needed
We do it like this like...
I'm still awake... in the middle of the night
Try to lay it down, try to close my eyes

At night I can't sleep
Cause my heart skip a beat
I can see it cause my heart on my sleeve
I can see the deceased
Tear into the flesh of the weak
Currency bear the mark of the beast
Never stand for the bull
Even when the market asleep
Anything I want is in arms reach
And the score is so sweet
But the consequence is that
I got to wear the mark of the thief
I am the man with one hand
Stranger in a foreign land
New identity cost a grand
It's the miracle worker
Serving up the offering
So make the disabled walk again
Got the melatonin, pouring in from the pineal gland
Like the blind man that saw again
Like el-Hajj Malik
Street cats fought for him
And they never ate pork again
Bear witness to the
You might also like
Power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
Make it clap like they're giving you a standing ovation
The adulation is such a powerful high
And as sour as my transportation
When I am heading for the clouds in the sky
Stay clean as the department of sanitation
Even though we from the gutter right
That's the power of transformation
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn (x3)
At night I can't sleep

At night I can't sleep
Cause my heart skip a beat
I can see it cause my heart on my sleeve
I can see the deceased
Tear into the flesh of the weak
Currency bear the mark of the beast
Never stand for the bull
Even when the market asleep
Anything I want is in arms reach
And the score is so sweet
But the consequence is that
I got to wear the mark of the thief
I am the man with one hand
Stranger in a foreign land
New identity cost a grand
It's the miracle worker
Serving up the offering
So make the disabled walk again
Got the melatonin, pouring in from the pineal gland
Like the blind man that saw again
Like el-Hajj Malik
Street cats fought for him
And they never ate pork again
Bear witness to the
Power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
That's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
It's the power of transformation
Make it clap like they're giving you a standing ovation
The adulation is such a powerful high
And as sour as my transportation
When I am heading for the clouds in the sky
Stay clean as the department of sanitation
Even though we from the gutter right
That's the power of transformation
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
Caterpillar to the butterfly
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn (x3)
At night I can't sleep
Change is God
Survival requires transformation
No one said it would be easy
But ain't nothing worth having, easy to get
So run towards the challenge
I love the challenge
Every challenge is a new opportunity
Of self-transformation
So run towards the challenge
I run towards the challenge
I run towards the challenge
I run towards the challenge
