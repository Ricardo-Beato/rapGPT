5 ContributorsLove Each Other Lyrics
And if we knew each other
Maybe we would love each other
Or maybe we should wanna run far away
To find a place the other could never discover
And if we knew each other
Maybe we would love each other
Or maybe we should wanna run far away
To find a place the other could never discover

And if I was your lover
Would you let yourself suffer?
Should you ever have to give another second thought
To whether or not you could discover somethin' better off?
But if it turns out I was the right one
Would you return to work this out like, "Hi, Sean"?
I should remind you, I'm just one fish
There's an ocean full, you could take your pick
And don't forget to take some pics and if I'm just a Band-Aid
Would it be considered bad taste
If we should decide to let the ship set sail?
It could be the destination that's destined to fail
And if I was a poor choice
When I made noise, would you hear me in your voice?
Should we be concerned about the future of
Or do you think that we can turn this into some mutual love?
You might also like
And if we knew each other
Maybe we would love each other
Or maybe we should wanna run far away
To find a place the other could never discover
And if we knew each other
Maybe we would love each other
Or maybe we should wanna run far away
To find a place the other could never discover

If we was just acquaintances
Would we still have this amazing sex?
Should we try to wake up and make some pancakes?
Could we find a way to combine our campaigns?
If this was just a friendship
How would that be any different?
Should you be instigatin' my decision makin'
If it couldn't compliment the experience that you're chasin'?
I gotta know if it's just a phase
Would you put away the maze?
I should get paid to feel this crazy
We could both raise the argument we both deserve a little change
And if it's all the same to y'all
Would you please step aside and let me take this fall?
Should you still feel like you've got a case to prove
You could tell everybody I'm afraid of you (Huh)
And if we knew each other
Maybe we would love each other
Or maybe we should wanna run far away
To find a place the other could never discover
And if we knew each other
Maybe we would love each other
Or maybe we should wanna run far away
To find a place the other could never discoverEmbed
