3 ContributorsStill I Love It Lyrics
My voice hit the track like icing on the cake
You niggas wasting your time with yo lil mixtapes
Nothin befo', nothin' after me
Got the street so locked, and I got the key
Keep a swisher full of kush, so I'm high
Should have been in the GQ, the flow so fly
The word is mine that you niggas didn't read the blimp
Like my swag call me young old scooter
God damn that young nigga rich
But the young nigga that's so cool
Its like he on the temp service, dude kept that work
You with a thottie knew want it, boy kept the purp
Ask the bottoms run through six
What they say, do kept them bricks
Just ordered me a charger, cocaine white
White paint, white rims, called the snow mobile
What else can I say, I walk like money
Rich conversation, I talk like money
Seen the movie Blow, I'm George or cheesy
Between me and you, I still got em
Can't get the streets up, man that shits in my vein
When In withdrawal mane I still talk 'caineYou might also likeEmbed
