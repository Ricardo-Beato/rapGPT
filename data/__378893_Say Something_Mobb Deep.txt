27 ContributorsSay Something Lyrics
Uh, yeah
M-O-B-B, baby
Money over every mutherfuckin' thing, you know?
Uh

I am not normal, let me be the first to warn you
Paranoid as fuck, front on me, that metal on you
Tears down the face of those that most adore you
Fuck the King of New York, H been royal
Might as well quit, throw the towel in
Niggas new to the game just an hour in
You wet behind the ears, milk on your breath
Still on your mama breast, I embody fresh
Bottle after bottle and some sloppy sex
On my bully shit, my dominance is obvious
Party after party, bitch
Stickin' to what got me rich 'til the casket drop
The clique is always infamous
Infamous, hatin' ass niggas on that bitter shit
Fuck outta here, I'll hit you in that liver quick
And spread through your body like a rumor
Serve these niggas like a waiter bring it to ya
Then I'm gone
You might also like
Fuck what niggas sayin', they ain't sayin' nothin'
See me any time of day, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Talkin' 'bout they let it spray, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Better yet, I'm right here, nigga, say somethin'
Fuck what niggas sayin', they ain't sayin' nothin'
See me any time of day, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Talkin' 'bout they let it spray, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Better yet, I'm right here, nigga, say somethin'

Yeah
Step inside my class I can show you how it go
Accumulate that money get that dollar in a row
Snowball effect, got that bigger, bigger check
Life is even better, better than a nigga dreamt
President is black, see you niggas still broke
Thirsty mcgirsy niggas knockin' at my door
Got hoes with they hands out
Promised me they ass, mouth
Pussy hoe tried to make me nut so they could cash out
And I'm like whoa
Baby girlm I finished trickin' long time ago
Feed you that liquor, take away your pain
Son of baby father deadbeat and that shit don't change
And that shit don't change, let me hit it again
Shawty dippin' in and out and just switchin' them lanes
Switchin' them lanes without checkin' the mirror
Get yourself into some bullshit make you see things clearer
Yeah
Fuck what niggas sayin', they ain't sayin' nothin'
See me any time of day, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Talkin' 'bout they let it spray, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Better yet, I'm right here, nigga, say somethin'
Fuck what niggas sayin', they ain't sayin' nothin'
See me any time of day, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Talkin' 'bout they let it spray, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Better yet, I'm right here, nigga, say somethin'

Yeah
Savage nigga out here on the cement
Pussy, money, guns grew me up and now I'm beastin'
Heathen, I'm a motherfucker, throw me to the wolves
Right where I belong, nigga, now you lookin' shook
Shakin' in your J's, you afraid
My boot on your neck, pussy nigga, it's no escape
I'm vicious, my intentions is not in your best interest
If I was your adviser, I'd advise you not to did it
But I'm not, so I'm invitin' you all, it's my pleasure
Welcome to the horror show, your life, feel free to enter
When I was a shit stain, the old heads they told me
Keep your gun on you, little nigga, I'm not your homie
Smokin' on a cocaine bogey
Breakfast was a OE
Ain't nobody smilin' and we treat these bitches coldly
Special breed, we a different type of G's
Niggas quieter than a church mouse when it's time to see
What it really is
Fuck what niggas sayin', they ain't sayin' nothin'
See me any time of day, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Talkin' 'bout they let it spray, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Better yet, I'm right here, nigga, say somethin'
Fuck what niggas sayin', they ain't sayin' nothin'
See me any time of day, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Talkin' 'bout they let it spray, they ain't sayin' nothin'
Better yet, I'm right here, nigga, say somethin'2Embed
