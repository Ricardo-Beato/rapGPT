36 ContributorsDracula’s Wedding Lyrics
You're all I've ever wanted, but I'm terrified of you
See, my castle may be haunted, but I'm terrified of you
I've cast my spell on millions, but I'm terrified of you
Baby, I do this from the ceiling, but I'm terrified of you

I wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened
Ooh, Dracula's wedd-

I've never ran from no one, but I'm terrified of you
See, my heartbeat is a slow one, but I'm terrified of you
I've been around for ages, but I'm terrified of you
Done my thang across the stage, but yet, I’m terrified of you

I wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened (Ooh)
Ooh, Dracula's wedding

Ah, you know I'm terrified
Oh, you know I'm terrified
You know I'm terrified
Shh-shh! Here she comes
You might also like
Three-thousand, three-thousand
Three-thousand, three-thousand

Give me the chance to dance romance
Don't run, I'm not the sun (Ha)
So much at stake, oh, bad choice of words
But I'm not the gun (shut up)
With silver bullets
And I can count (One, two, three)
Plus, I make great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, Van Helsing

For richer or poorer
Through sickness and in health
'Til death do us part
'Til death do us part
You only live once
Well, not in our case
'Cause we live forever4Embed
