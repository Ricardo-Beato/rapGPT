3 ContributorsIntro (Black Friday Mixtape) Lyrics
Shit is all different now man
Back then, they used to pay homage
For paving the way, for making it easier
To do what they do now
But they do now?
They run their mouth
But you know what?
Actions speak louder than words
(She's your queen to be
A vision of perfection
An object of affection
To quench your royal fire
Completely free from infection
To be used at your discretion
Where they owe me for your direction
Your queen to be
Queen to be, queen to be forever
To quench your royal fire
She's your queen to be, queen to be forever
To quench your royal fire
She's your queen to be, queen to be forever
To quench your royal fire
She's your queen to be, queen to be forever
To quench your royal fire)
