26 ContributorsThe Funeral (Intro) Lyrics
Niggas are in the state of emergency
The Death Side, a mirrored image of where we are today
The Life Side, a vision of where we need to go
So sign your death certificate
(A message to the world)
(I heardâ€”, wait a minute)
Fuck all y'all

Lisa got him
Alright, on three, one, two, three
Get all folks together, this way
Can't believe it, though
Tom, yo
Hey, open that door
Open that one first
Alright, alright
We've come together by God's demand
Whether it be for life or death
Well, this morning
It's over the mourning of one of our little brothers
This brother was a good brother
He didn't get into an excessive amount of trouble
But it's one thing, it's one thing, it's one thing
He was the wrong nigga to fuck withYou might also like2Embed
