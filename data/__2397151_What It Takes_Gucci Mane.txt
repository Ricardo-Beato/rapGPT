7 ContributorsWhat It Takes Lyrics
What better gift to the streets than some new Gucci Mane nigga
So accept this, as a gift, from the trap gods, to the streets

Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
I take a nigga’s bitch
I take a nigga’s place
I take a nigga’s bong
Right in front his face
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
I take a nigga’s bitch
Right in front his face
I take a nigga’s bitch
Y’all ain't got what it takes?

Young Vic got what it takes
That’s what they fucking say
I’m from the block where alley cats, they tryna duck a stray
And keep the  in a safe cause it ain’t fucking safe
Ugly E, he like a corner pocket ‘cause he tucking 8
You know we hustle boy, that’s the rules of engagement
My Alexander Wang all black like the Zulu nation
Bitches still rocking Lululemon girl you out your league
But I could teach you yoga booty let you work the D
Shout to 1017, I’m so S-A-V-E
I tat that on my sleeve, like this B-A-P-E
Bought that in Tokyo, I just left Shibuya hoe
I’m twisting green up, California sushi roll
That’s how it taste
You might also like
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
I take a nigga’s bitch
I take a nigga’s place
I take a nigga’s bong
Right in front his face
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
I take a nigga’s bitch
Right in front his face
I take a nigga’s bitch
Y’all ain't got what it takes?

See I got what it take
I’ll pull up in that wraith
I know this bitch gon’ go
I can tell from her face
And she know who I am
So she know what I make
And she know who you are
She know that jewelry fake
See when you getting cake
You don’t go on dates
But when she know you broke
She gon’ make you wait
So what, she got a job
Her check’s two weeks away
That bitch gon’ fuck today
I’ll pay her what she make
I went broke one day
But I got what it take
I brought a gun for eight
And went took 40k
I heard he holding weight
And went to shawty’s place
I swear if shawty play
Then it’s First 48
And I just bought the chain
That bitch cost forty eight
Your jewelry not the same
Lil nigga know your place
Better stay in your lane
Lil nigga know your race
And I’m fly like a plane
And that’s in every state
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
I take a nigga’s bitch
I take a nigga’s place
I take a nigga’s bong
Right in front his face
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
Y’all niggas got what it takes?
I take a nigga’s bitch
Right in front his face
I take a nigga’s bitch
Y’all ain't got what it takes?2Embed
