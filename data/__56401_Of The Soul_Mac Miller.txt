50 ContributorsOf The Soul Lyrics
Uh, looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like three years
My handwriting is—, is horrible and I can barely read this
Hmm

Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of all the drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops, "Suck dog nuts," haha
Arrivin' to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes, very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carrey feel
At the amusement park, scared of heights, Ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu (One time for the grind)
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu
You might also like
Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9"
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrificin' sanity, sacrificin' normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work four bars that are tighter than your cornrows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the fourth row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put 'em into sonnets
Let me put you on this, nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna find a way
Spread, like yolk of a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu
Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, a hundred-ten degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was seventeen, I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yeah, I need my medicine
Fuckin' Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'ma be the best, have some patience
You thought that it was great, then poof
It was nothin' but some déjà vu

Haha, yeah14Embed
