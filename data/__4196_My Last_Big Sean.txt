Hands up in the air
I just want the, I just want the baddest bitch in the world
Right here on my lap, huh

And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this ass up like it's my last (Boi)
I swear I'ma, swear (Boi) I'ma do it like I (Do it)
Like I never had it at a-a-a-all (Oh)
A-A-A-All (Oh)
Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all (Boi)
Like I never had it all, a-a-a-all (Boi, hey, hey)

Okay, now where that alcohol? You ain't even got to ask (Ask)
'Cause I'ma drink it all like, like it's my last (Okay)
She a seven in the face, but a ten in the ass (Yeah)
And she even look better by the end of my glass (Damn)
See, I just walked in fresher than the Certs off in this muhfucka (Look)
I'ma need the baddest broad to twerk off in this muhfucka (Woah)
I'ma go hard until it hurts off in this muhfucka (Go)
I'm a boss, so you gotta work off in this muhfucka (In this muhfucka)
And I can get you anythin' you want (Want)
I could, I could, I could, I could put you on (On)
See, you look like Beyoncé, so do it like Beyon— (Okay)
Do it, do it like Beyoncé, and put it on Sean (Haha)
Grind hard, but got a lot to show for it (Yeah)
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it (Skrrt)
My team's so true, we should get a camera crew (Why?)
To follow us around and make a show for us

And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last

Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all (Yeah, never had it at all, man)
Like I never had it at all, a-a-a-all (Boi, boi, boi)

Now I'ma fill this glass up like it's my last (Last)
I'ma, I'ma blow this bag up like it's my last (Last)
I'ma, I'ma spend this cash up like it's my last (Go)
And I'ma make it last (Last), like it's my last
And I'm gone (Gone), can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space
All, all up in my face, like, "You remember who I am?"
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eatin' all the Wonton (What's good?)
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants, now she rockin' Sean john (Hahaha, damn)
Man, I just ended up on everybody guest list (Yup)
I'm just doin' better than what everyone projected
I knew that I'd be here, so if you asked me how I feel (What?)
I'ma just tell you, it's everythin' that I expected, bitch (Boi, boi)
Hands up in the air (The air, do it)
One time for the Westside, Westside (Boi, boi)
Let me see them hands up in the air (The air, D-Town)
Two times if you love G.O.O.D. Music
Hands up in the air (The air, boi, boi, boi)
And three times for the baddest chick in the world who got her
Hands up in the air (The air, do it, yeah)

Now I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last (Yeah)
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last (Oh)
I'ma, I'ma hit this ass up like it's my last (Do it)
I swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like I (Oh-woah, oh, do it)
Like I never had it at a-a-a-all (Oh-oh)
A-A-A-All
Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all (Oh)
Like I never had it at all, a-a-a-all (Oh-woah, oh-woah)

Big ass bottles, big ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public
'Cause if you don't do it big, bitch, you ain't doin' nothin' (Haha)

And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma, I'ma hit this ass up like it's my last (Boi)
I swear I'ma, swear (Boi) I'ma do it like I (Do it)
Like I never had it at a-a-a-all (Yeah)
A-A-A-All (Oh, no, D-Town)
Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all (At all, do it)
A-A-A-All (Oh!)
A-A-A-All
A-A-A-All
Like I, like I never had it at a-a-a-all (Yeah)
Like I never had it at all, a-a-a-all26Embed
