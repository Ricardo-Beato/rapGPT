That's my word nigga
Get the fuck outta here
Better watch your motherfuckin' back
Watch my back? Word?
I'm gonna get Biggie, I'm gonna kill Biggie
You soft duke, you soft
Fuck all you niggas, you all ain't SHIT
Watch your motherfuckin' back
Eat a dick
*Click*

Jealousy's a motherfucker, you weak jealous motherfuckers!
If you a jealous motherfucker, you just a weak motherfucker!
See when you on top, motherfuckers just wanna bring you down!
Motherfuckers don't even know you, and they don't like you
You might also like
Uhh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set off
Shoulda pushed him dead off, wipe the sweat off (uhh)
'Cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigues bring fatigue, to enemies, look man
You wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crouched up over the casket, screamin' "BASTARD!"
Cryin', know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed him, filled him with the lugers from they Rugers
Or the Desert, dyin' ain't the shit, but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot
Givin' cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me
Sorta like Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still
That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray, they pray)
This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin'
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team and
Be more gone than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places, new faces
Fuck the screw faces, 'cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggas can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (what)
Some old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what)
Specialize in killin' wives and grandmothers
Who ya trustin', shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin' ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin' broads home
On the phone with the chip, with these Cristal chicks
'Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit

That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray, they pray)
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall
That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray, they pray)
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall, fall
We used to hold the gold, now we floss with diamonds
Niggas want my team to stop shinin'
Pray my fame start declinin'
Whinin' like girlies (stop whinin' you bitches)
We been around the world twice, all we got is mo' ice
And mo' nice, sacrifice your heart
Lexus with the automatic start (what)
Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eatin' shrimp Ã€ la carte, with some bitches from Brussels
Eatin' clams and mussels
Uhh, octopus, pretty face no waist
I just want the bush, so I can mack it
Give her a package to push, 'cause I work them hoes
Pendejos I show you how to play them hoes
Can you just visualize it?
Before I go to sleep I check the beds and the closet
So I can sleep safe, not too many keep a mil' in the briefcase
Infrareds help me sleep safe, but wait

That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray, they pray)
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall, fall

See, y'all motherfuckers live off of negativity
What y'all niggas need to get through your motherfuckin' heads
Is that, y'all fuckin' with some niggas that's on a higher
Motherfuckin' level -- we don't give a fuck
About what you think about us how you feel about us
What you got to say about us
We gon keep doing our motherfuckin' thing
From now 'til the year three thousand bitches!
You can't breathe, you can't sleep, you can't eat
Without thinkin' about us!
And without thinkin' about us on your mind
We gon' haunt your asses MOTHERFUCKERS!

That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray, they pray)
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall, fall
(They pray, they pray, they pray, they pray)
(They pray, they pray)11Embed
