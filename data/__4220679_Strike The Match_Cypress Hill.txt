2 ContributorsStrike The Match Lyrics
I'm loaded like a shotgun
Got one under my coat
It’s late night no stage fright
I'm going for broke
While I'm hittin’ my smoke
I'm contemplatin' how to hit em hard
Hit em fast
Get away it's all she wrote
It's a heartbreaking habit
When you gotta have it
You grab it
Stare at an album
So good at it
Certified
Good magic
Look at it
In your face
Money's gone
So am I so long
But now my hustle's changed
No more stickin' you up
I’ve got some weed I know that for sure it can lift you up
Just spark it up
I gotta dime or a twenty sack
All sales are final
Don’t ask for your money back
Don't even look at the money sack
It’s funny that
It still wasn't enough
I like still searchin' for honey flack
No I'm servin’ the boulders
Looking over my shoulders
Every step that I take
A rock might knock me over
You might also like
Strike the match
That sparks the flame
Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit em hard hit em fast
Keep the gas on em
We're gonna char
Get the dogs go gas on em

Lone range
A brace to be a gangster
Grew up
Rock stages
A long way from
But i got gauges
Comin' out pullin guns out on strangers
Bunch a wild niggas
Nobody can tame us
Sixteen in the clip
One in the chamber
Drive by homicide
Shit I gotta roll a dime
Ever day I ran away
My life one helluva time
I like to see heads get busted
A problem
That's how i solve em
No discussion
Go for my mind
Task force rush em
Until that day
All i gotta say is fuck em
Strike the match
That sparks the flame
Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit em hard hit em fast
Keep the gas on em
We're gonna char
Get the dogs go gas on em

Post it on the top son
Claw some
Makin' my way
Through the jungle
Living with the life
Call something
Evolving with each hustle
The street sweep
To a heatseeker
With ambitions to be a ring leader
When you're in the top spot
You better be top notch
If not watch the haters take pot shots
It's non-stop shit talkin'
Beat off the conflict
Ready to harm him
Disarm him
Send his ass away in a coffin
My game is silent you don't see it that often
But every passing day I see the time slipping away
Ticket on a train 'til an early grave
Reap what you sough
Never had a handout
Had my hustle's planned out
Worked to get the brand out
You wish my luck would run out
Strike the match
That sparks the flame
Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit em hard hit em fast
Keep the gas on em
We're gonna char
Get the dogs go gas on emEmbed
