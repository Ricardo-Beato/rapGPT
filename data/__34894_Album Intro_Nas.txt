1996!
Back up in this nigga
The right way, though, you know?
(Double-tre son, you know ain't nothin' coincidental or accidental, dunn)
No doubt!
(You know how it's goin' down, man)
It was all written
(No question, I'm sayin' man, I mean, how we playin' man
You know what I'm sayin', they dealt us in, son
They playin' with a 54 deck, you see with the jokers in and everything, you know what I'm saying?)
Son, I'm playin' with the 52
(You wanna stress on how I used to play, that's how I playin')
But, yo, they takin' us into this next millennium, right now
(I'm sayin' law, you know what I'm sayin' we gotta lay the law
Cause without law ain't no order, you know what I'm sayin'
That's why these cats are slippin' through, you know what I'm sayin? They got the rules missin' though)
True
(Yo, word up, though, you know what I mean?)
Son, these niggas look faker than the new hundred dollars, son
(Yeah, you see that they look Monopoly money, right?)
Word, with the big ass face on it
(Yo, what I'm sayin', we see through all that, though
You know what I'm sayin?)
No question
(All eyes seein', son, you know it was written, no question)
Yo, no doubt. In the Qu'ran it says Nas, the men
Nesa's the woman, you know? It was writtenYou might also like6Embed
