I'ma get on this TV, mama
I'ma, I'ma put **** down
I'ma make sure these light-skinned ****
Never, ever, never come back in style
Told 'em I finished school and I started my own business
They say, "Oh, you graduated?" No, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there
Everything I want, I gotta wait a year, I wait a year
This **** graduated at the top of our class
I went to Cheesecake, he was a **** waiter there

I got a Jones like Norah for your soror
Bring more of them girls, I've seen in The Aurora
Tammy, Becky, and Laura, or a Shirley
I'm trying to hit it early, like I'm in a hurry
See, that's how dude became the young Pootie Tang: "tippy tow"
Roc-A-Fella chain, yeah, that's my rapper style
Rosary piece, yeah, that's my Catholic style
Red and white Ones, yeah, that's my Kappa style
And I ain't even pledge
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead
If I could go through all that and still be breathing
****, bend over, I'm here for a reason
