Cold blooded, chilly skin
Can't touch it like your front wheel when it's wheely-ing
Wanna see Chilly free like Free Willy friend
Wanted to see Free Willy really swim
I'm super cold, my jacket thin
I'm two below like a marching band
That means I'm super-deep, you surface skim
I'm the whole thing, you niggas 2%
Put em up on that carton, I think I'm losing em
Bring all those St. Bernards in
Let's get some booze in them
You know them dogs with them barrels on they neck
And I'mma keep it cool like airholes on a Tec
I be moving birds like a scarecrow's on the set
Part dope-ass nigga, an old man winter
Christmastime diamond singing carols on my chest
Step up off the jet
Looking like a Pharaoh in the flesh

I'm super cold

I'm super-cold, my freezer deep
My cooler closed: air-conditioned seats
I don't trust them niggas, they conviction weak
They be thawing out, my commitment keeps
Twelve months, hope that well jumps
Seems like selling souls, is havin' sales bumps
I be in to win while your sales slump
Your chances getting slim, mine on their 12th brunch
And they smell lunch: Hercules Klump
Throw my weight around
Ain't left the scale once
Always bear in mind: even with your white fur
We still polar opposites: you ice picks to icebergs
I'm colder than Universal Soldier
Angel on my back everywhere I'm at
Niggas don't believe it just when I lay it down
And when I get back up and see my angel on the ground..

Super cold
Super cold
Super cold
Super cold
Super cold
Super cold
Super cold

Chicken soup for souls, now who could use a bowl?
Don't be salty now, trying to reduce my snow
Cause I just move em out: Ice Man
Fresh out a mutant school, I ain't no student though
Black Shaun White and he skis, and he skates
And he leaves all types of cold tracks all behind me
And you can follow those if you ever wanna find me
Better dress warm or you might end up like the Shining
Not that boy or that lady, but that nigga gone crazy
Pretty damn amazing: I can't get out
So I'm forced to ride this elevator anywhere it takes me
But when I hit my flow, I'm-a open up that door
Won't be three stacks or your cousin, but just that super cold8Embed
