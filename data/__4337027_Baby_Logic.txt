39 ContributorsBaby Lyrics
Oh baby, you, you got what I need
She says she only wants a friend
Says she only needs a friend
Oh baby, I, I got what you need
No, I can't just be a friend
No, I'll never be a friend
Oh baby, you, you got what I need
She says she only wants a friend
Says she only needs a friend
Oh baby, I, I got what you need
No, I can't just be a friend
No, I'll never be a friend
Oh baby

I've been down for the cause for a minute now
Be lying if I said I didn't want to hit it now
On a hunnid, that thought been running through my mind
'Cause baby girl, you're just too fine
But first, I want to make you mine
Study you like constellations, I wonder what make you shine
On that 9-to-5 grind, but girl, you got bigger dreams
If there's no one there to tell you you're destined for bigger things
I'll be the one to let you know you're brighter than the sun
More beautiful than any girl I've seen where I'm from
By any girl ever, anywhere I might have gone
I only have eyes for you, that's why I wrote this song
Life's changing fast, I feel like I don't have long
To tell you anything you want, girl, you can do it
And I'ma be there when you make it, smiling like I knew it
Every man you gave your heart before me, yeah, they blew it
I just want the chance to show you how I do it
You might also like
And you, you got what I need
She says she only wants a friend
Says she only needs a friend
Oh baby, I, I got what you need
No, I can't just be a friend
No, I'll never be a friend
Oh baby, you, you got what I need
She says she only wants a friend
Says she only needs a friend
Oh baby, I, I got what you need
No, I can't just be a friend
No, I'll never be a friend (Yeah)
Oh baby

I've given my heart away just to have it beaten up
That's a heart attack, now my shit don't beat enough
But ever since the day we met, girl, I could read your bluff
If I wrote you letters every day, would you read the stuff?
Girl, if I gave you my everything, would it be enough?
The road is hard, and my current situation is rough
They say there's plenty more fish in the sea
But you're the only one God made just for me
Sometimes I wonder if you know I exist
Or if I told you how I felt, would you be like
"Hold up, who the fuck is this?"
Sometimes it feel like I'm inside a love movie
But I'm the extra in the background, truly
Wishing that he had the leading lady
But I guess it wasn't written for me, maybe
Unless I flip the script and just ignore the words read
Sweep you off your feet with the all the things I never said
'Cause every man you gave your heart before me, they blew it
I just wish I had the chance to show you how I do it
Every man before me, man, they blew it
I just wish I could show you, I'd be like
Hey baby, you, you got what I need
She says she only wants a friend
Says she only needs a friend
Oh baby, I, I got what you need
No, I can't just be a friend
No, I'll never be a friend
Oh baby, you, you got what I need
She says she only wants a friend
Says she only needs a friend
Oh baby, I, I got what you need
No, I can't just be a friend
No, I'll never be a friend
