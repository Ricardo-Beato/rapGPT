58 ContributorsCream Lyrics
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

I've been having these nightmares of losing time, with no reward
Momma would call the Lord, before she call the law
Then I went and found time in a Audemars
Time is money, so I spent it all trying to order more
They say beef is a poor man's sport
Behind the money, get that rhyme report, fuck it

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

Uh, I don't cut the work, droptop on 20's
Soon as I learned how to talk I talked business
Nigga's ain't safe, all 9 innings
And to you it's just change, I want every JC Penney
And I walk up in your funeral late, suit rented
Lift a mini skirt, get behind her like Benny
Goin' at your neck, get the rope, tie a noose
This a gut check, now who do I write it to?
I'm dirty like ENT, shout out to Murphy Lee
Gotta cut up the credit cards, plastic surgery
I'm a God, mercy me, I'm higher than Mercury
Smokin' on that strong, full of that Hercules
Bartender, hurry up, hurry up with my drink
Niggas pullin capers like they come with a string
I'm standing over the stove with my gun in the sink
Cause I don't know what niggas thinkin, but I know how they think
Uh, catch a skateboard to the jaw
I'm in that pussy, she in awe
And this here is my homeboy, Quick Draw McGraw
I'm even on both sides of the seesaw
You can get your head cut off with a saw, yeehaw
Kill you and your right-hand man, southpaw
Money over bitches, and above the law
Money over bitches, and above the law, money
You might also like
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

Uh, pocket full of money, with a posse full of hitters
Black and white Porsches, like a Nazi with a nigga
Money make the world, 360
We throw them dollars up, them bitches better be Frisbees
Pounds in the freezer, 50 rounds in the sweeper
Counter full of coke, naked bitch baggin' up
And if the bitch stealing, I know where her Mama live
I love this shit so much, I got on a tux
Man, it's been a minute since I seen my nigga Bubba
Some niggas fade away, some niggas hit the jumper
Kidnap your niece, don't cry, call your uncle
We don't wanna hurt ya, baby, we just want your uncle
25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
I ain't hearin' that bullshit, I'm deafer than Leppard
Somewhere out wherever, they find your body severed
You know they findin' niggas guilty like they finding treasure
But get your money on occasions, I get too wasted
It's an occasion
I heard a nurse say, "Thank you for being so patient"
I know my nigga's got me, we good forever
Get the cheese nigga, please, avoid the shredder
Turning good to better, gotta pull it together
I wish that blood on the floor, was rose petals
Real gangstas die of old age
And old money, get paid, my nigga, Tunechi
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all10Embed
