Okay, out here in Cali
Smoking on this green that look like Luigi
I got my Fiji, I'm finna take your girl to the water
Dis finna be a breeze!

Yard full of grass, raking up dough
Still on my shit who I'm makin' it fo?
House on the hills with the lake in the fron'
Old ass nigga should be takin' it slow
So what?
No, what yo cut ain't mine
Nigga get up off my line
I'm back to the basics
Tracing shit
Gangbang nigga with the basic shit
Real P.I. with amazing spits
So I never ever never have to chase a bitch
Dig it, and I came wit it
And your only hoe might get it, admit it
Locked in, locked out
Talk shit, get socked out
See, these is G's
And this is finna be a breeze
You might also like
Yeah, music, please
Dis finna be a breeze
And my keys
And my trees
Dis finna be a breeze
Yeah
Dis finna be a breeze
Music please
And my keys
And my trees

Picture me sitting in my throne alone
L.B.C. yeah I'm on the moon
Zone to zone, I'll roam in Rome
Solid as a rock, etched in stone
Retriever, retriever
Catch the bone
Big dog, baby
The rest are clones
Bass go boom with the baritone
Clearing shit up like a claritone
I'm really home, I'm barely gone
Look at my eyes, I'm really blown
Peoples is ready for me to rap
But I just took a whole bone to the neck
No sweat on the set
Sprinter van to the jet
Yeah, music, please
Dis finna be a breeze
Yeah, music, please
Dis finna be a breeze
And my keys
And my trees
Dis finna be a breeze
Yeah
Dis finna be a breeze
Music please
And my keys
And my trees

*coughing*
Fuck, whatchu got me on?
I thought dis was finna be a breeze
You got me on my knees begging God, please
For my soul back
I'm fried!3Embed
