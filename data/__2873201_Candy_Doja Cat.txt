I can name a couple ways, baby, this shit might go
You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' high for
Men that like to do the things to remain that guy who
Need someone who's sweet and not gon' shoot to make that high note

And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby I got everything and so much more than she's got

And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

Sugar coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper
Sugar coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real43Embed
