11 ContributorsMama We Made It Lyrics
Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking 'bout cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces
Quarterback Migos, Troy Aikman
Screaming out mama we made it

Young nigga came from the bottom
Young nigga go get the guala
Trap out a hotel Ramada
They calling me Quavo Mufasa
Open the trap like carcass
We knowing you niggas imposters
They liking the Pi√±a colada
I remix it with a lil' powder
Hit a nigga with a chopper
It will take about forty-eight hours
No Courage, you niggas is cowards
He got the pack and my niggas surround him
The Chattahoochee where they found him
My niggas go get the bounty
We hold 'em up for ransom
If a nigga get hot, leave the county
Migos on top of the mountain
Listen up boy, it's a Migos announcement
I got the pigeons and falcons
Now I got the keys, I used to trap ounces
Came from the boards on the houses
Them niggas is telling I'm calling them mouses
Beat the pack like Ronda Rousey
Free Bobby Shmurda and free my boy Rowdy
I came from the pavement
Look at them niggas they mad that I made it
Look at their faces
'Cause I'm at the top can nobody replace it
I used to be robbing
Hang with the goons, my niggas were goblins
Trap out the apartments
Turning the North side into a lil' Harlem
You might also like
Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking 'bout cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces
Quarterback Migos, Troy Aikman
Screaming out mama we made it

My niggas came from the pavement
So many chains like a slavery
Taking a trip to Croatia
Plug sent the pack be coming in from Haiti
Counting up these Benjamin faces
Young nigga, I got rich off of Caucasian
Migo my gang, ain't no trading
Fucking these bitches, they from different races
Rick Owens, they came with no laces
Cooking up dope and the junkies gonna taste it
Your bitch gave me brain, that's my favorite
Told that bitch watch her teeth 'cause she got braces
Remember me nigga, gon' envy me
People gon' hate on me, just 'cause I made it
Talk about me like we might be related
You need to sue your jewelry, Rollie outdated
Don't you twist your fingers if you ain't banging
I be in the bando with the dope boys slanging
Pouring up a soda, I leave it contaminated
All of my niggas that screaming out mama we made it
I know y'all niggas flexing for the check
Now one of them chains is yours around your neck
We start from the North side, screaming free Offset
I gave him a test, get a vest, and then get hit with the Tec
Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking 'bout cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces
Quarterback Migos, Troy Aikman
