5 ContributorsAll Night Long Lyrics
Well, well, well, baby

Girl, take off your dress
I won't take nothin' less
I wanna get with you
Do what grown folks do
I wanna work that body, oh
Scream, "Oh my God"
The best thing that I've ever seen, yeah, yeah, yeah"

(You say that I treat you like a freak)
You say that I treat you like a freak, baby, baby
(But all the while you like my style and can't leave)
Yeah, oh

So I'll be turnin' you on, strokin' you long, makin' you moan
All night long
So I'll be turnin' you on, strokin' you long, makin' you moan
All night long (All night long)

Now all the girls tell that I'm freaky
And I can't lie, I know just what they mean
So come on baby, let me work my jelly
Turn around and smile for me, yeah
Hold on tight, yeah (Hold on tight)
I got your thighs open all night, yeah, yeah
You might also like
(You say that I treat you like a freak)
Girl, you said I treat you like a freak
(But all the while you like my style and can't leave)
Like my style, drives you wild

So I'll be turnin' you on, strokin' you long, makin' you moan
All night long (All night long)
So I'll be turnin' you on, strokin' you long, makin' you moan
All night long (All night long)

I've got you in position, stickin' you in your middle like Monie
Diggin' in, you peeped me this evening at the Shoney's
Swervin', you makin' faces while you squeal for my homies
The moment's intense as we commence to bump slowly
You lonely, and homely, and I'm a fiend for your stickin'
Full of ginseng suckin' hippie
You remindin' me of Darling Nikki, masturbatin' on the telephone
Listenin' to me dickin' out a yellow bone

Ain't nobody gon' stop me from sexin'
Ain't nobody gon' stop me from sexin'
(Ain't nobody gon' stop me)
I wanna get nasty (Can I get nasty?)
Can I get nasty? (Yeah)
I wanna get nasty (Yeah, yeah)
So I'll be turnin' you on, strokin' you long, makin' you moan
All night long
So I'll be turnin' you on, strokin' you long, makin' you moan
All night long
So I'll be turnin' you on, strokin' you long, makin' you moan
All night long
So I'll beâ€”Embed
