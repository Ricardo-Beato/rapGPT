 so you can feel it when it 
This ain't B2K, this ain't even DTP
 M.O.B., and So Icy ENT
 lil daddy, what it do?
Hell yeah we got that bud,  this one ain't for you
You niggas know my name, and you bitches know it too
Watch my niggas turn the club to a motherfucking zoo
, just don't give a fuck
I like to act a fool, ike I just don't give a fuck
 in the hood, 
I be sippin on Patrone, till I make me throw it up
I got 20's on the lack, I got 4's on the Chevy
That big black thang, got lil mama riding heavy
It's Gucci Mane and Shawnna, just to let you kids know
If you ain't getting no money, then what you here for?

Let me see your eyes
 got me 
Let me see your eyes
 got me 
I know you wanna 
I see it in your face
But let me see your eyes
 got me 
Lеt me see your eyes
 got me 
Lеt me see your eyes
 got me 
I know you wanna 
I see it in your face
But let me see your eyes
 got me 
You might also like
 can I get another one?
 first class 
 Shawnna and Gucci Mane
Smoking on a half a pound, East Atlanta, Chi Town
 ain't know I got 
And you know I make it rain, so I'm 
Gucci Mane LaFlizzle, they call me 
You know I'm on , so I don't want 
 white girl, Gucci Mane 
 I know I sound proper
Shawnna keep it crunk, and Gucci keep it street
Straight  street, nigga damb my speech
Shawty touch her toes, we got money on the floor
Throwing money in the air, that's what it's meant for
 it's payed for
We rolling on them beans,  wearing shades for
It's Gucci!

Let me see your eyes
 got me 
Let me see your eyes
 got me 
I know you wanna 
I see it in your face
But let me see your eyes
 got me 
Let me see your eyes
 got me 
Let me see your eyes
 got me 
I know you wanna 
I see it in your face
But let me see your eyes
 got me 
See it in my eyes
All about my pay
You ain't got no money
Then get up out my face
He looking at my ice
He looking at mmy Benz
He looking at my ass
He tryna grab my 
 motherfucking 
He don't know who I be
 with my chain
He saw that 
It's money over everything
Tell me what you see
And this for all my niggas
Getting money in the streets
Now roll another swisher
And pop another pill
I'm riding with the top down,  my whip
You know I don't 
You know I don't 
And this another banger
 Gucci Mane 
I got Gucci Mane with me
 through your city
And you know it's something pretty
So nigga think twice
I'm  my shades
So he can't see my eyes
Let me see your eyes
 got me 
Let me see your eyes
 got me 
I know you wanna 
I see it in your face
But let me see your eyes
 got me 
Let me see your eyes
 got me 
Let me see your eyes
 got me 
I know you wanna 
I see it in your face
But let me see your eyes
 got me Embed
