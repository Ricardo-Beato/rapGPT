I can love you
I can love you
I can love you
I can love you better

Bitches think they livin' in a dream 'til I wake 'em up
Faded off the liquor, limousines waiting in the front
Looking for a nigga with the green shinin' in the club
Trying to trade the hoes life for the red rose life
Hope we roll dice, but a seed ain't what you want
18 years with a check coming every month
Every step you take will get you closer to the paper
Pay attention to the ones known
The Marilyn Monroes use their wombs as ways to move forward
Fall with the rules to bask in the glory
Bastard child often lost in the story
Sad and unfortunate, but the game's to win

Say you love her, you losin'
She don’t want him involved
Keep your heart in your chest
And your head in the stars
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
You might also like
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better

He don't love her at all, but he fuckin' her raw
Tales of Adam and Eve birthin' a bitch and a dog
How you follow a heart colder than winter in Prague
Love for the wealth and the self, her mind full of everything else
The Bible she hide in the shelf, doubt she ever open it
Lost in the world, just tryin' to figure where to go from here
Wonder what her motive is, she wonder what your focus is
Every man she ever felt done lied and left her to herself
Scared of the future, runnin' from the past
Like she's starin' in the grave while you starin' at her ass
Young, dumb, and depraved, heart numb from the pain
Eyes strain from the tears, yeah, she stuck in her ways

Say you love her, you losin'
She don’t want him involved
Keep your heart in your chest
And your head in the stars
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better

I can love you
I can love you better
I can love you
I can love you
I can love you better
I can love you
I can love you better
Love you better
Mine, mine, mine
You're mine, mine, mine
'Cuz I can love you better40Embed
