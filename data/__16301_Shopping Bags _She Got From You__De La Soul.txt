11 ContributorsShopping Bags (She Got From You) Lyrics(We not goin' to JC Penney's, we not goin' to Macy's either)

Shopping bags, they weigh down her arms
Popping tags and collars her charm
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you
Manolo and Prada's her style
Louis, Burberry by the pile
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you

Yo, she know you come to do it, so what'cha want
Candlelight right back atcha
Put your credit card through it, she know what to flaunt
I handle tight like her master
She's the talk on the runway, yeah she's down the tree
The avenue like her catwalk
Struck a bit to the gunplay, that housing street
Looks to die for, ask that chalk man for yo' hand
Spend it, you live to show
All the cash that you can burn
What you need is to end it, 'cause you give the dough
But get no ass back in return (Ha, haha, ha)
Stay laughin', straight at you dawg
Best believe you wastin' time
Don't deny what's happenin', just clear the fog
And achieve you a peace line, yo it goes like
You might also like
Shopping bags, they weigh down her arm
Popping tags and collars her charm
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you
She got from you, she, sh-she, she got it
She got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it

Her frame goes beyond thick, she got you stunned
Living it up off the pop hits
Like a dame on a Bond flick, she's not the one
To give it up 'til you cop shit
Just because she's stacked right, she got your soul
Her every wish you now obey
You should be on that act-right but she got control
She say "Jump", you scream "Okay! I'm reloaded!"
Nigga, you shootin' blanks
Tryin' to front like you got game
Her crib is sugar coated like she lootin' banks
But it's your wallet she done claimed
When the limit of your plastic reaches the end
You start payin' for your time
She'll be in it for the last bit of money to spend
(Ha, haha, ha) And you'll be left with dimes
While she fillin' up
Shopping bags, they weigh down her arms
Popping tags and collars her charm
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you
Manolo and Prada's her style
Louis, Burberry by the pile
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you
She got from you, she, sh-she, she got it
She got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it
