8 ContributorsI Canâ€™t Be Your Man Lyrics
I got ma cousin with me you know
Hi Keisha 
Mustard on the beat

I can't be your man I know y'all want too many
I got Keisha, Leisha, Tia, Brittney I can't forget Whitney
Hello peter pan she missed her blessing
Fucked over DK now this whole one bleeding
Now she right back stressing

Do you really wanna, ass fat she
Heading to the  room and
She hotter than a covenant in fucking summer
Four book I try to stray just like thunder
Yea yea yeaaaaa, yea yea
Ima hit her then pass her to ma h like speed
They can't find me i'm  getting ma dick sucked in the b
She got high off ma hard no little weed
15 hundred for ma shades that shit tired from way far
Bought a car those are jar don't play cards got the cough
 I can't park it just bark i'm a star
Love ma bitch bad but i'm a motherfucking dogg, bitches
Say ma son gonna be gay cause he spoilt
Ysl with the snakes in yo yard he called up bruno tell him meet
Me on mars lil b hopped in the phantom picking her bras

I can't be your man I know y'all want too many
I got Keisha, Leisha, Tia, Brittney I can't forget Whitney
Hello peter pan, she missed her blessing
Fucked over DK now this whole one bleeding
Now she right back stressing

Girl you work that twerk that pussy like a door knob
Who turn up. Huh like usher let it burn now I
Never give a fuck never give a damn
Never will and a never have
I put a bitch on a slab and you better bring
 back, if not bitch you get smacked
Now, like the dvd when you suck me down don't do no teeth
I like to kick back get high like Wiz Khalif
Yeah, bitch I know you notice me yeah
You see them diamonds on the polo t
That's why you wanna fuck me and suck me
Head game girl like kiki you don't do what
Girl please

I can't be your man I know y'all want too many
I got Keisha, Leisha, Tia, Brittney I can't forget Whitney
Hello peter pan she missed her blessing
Fucked over DK now this whole one bleeding
Now she right back stressingEmbed
