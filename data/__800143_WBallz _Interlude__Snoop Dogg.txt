2 ContributorsWBallz (Interlude) Lyrics
Yeah, if you ain't careful you gon' get carpal tunnel on this one, heh-heh
It's the Spider Man AKA DJ EZ-Dicc
And it's time to shoot a rope and get the head right
It's the Jack Off Hour, girl
And you know it's WBALLZ
The number one station via CD satellite
Breakin' you off into the early morning lightYou might also likeEmbed
