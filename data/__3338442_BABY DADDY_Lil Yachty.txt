82 ContributorsBABY DADDY Lyrics
Uh

Tell your baby daddy I'm richer (30, you a fool for this one)
Bitch, I don't wanna sip liquor
Stop tryna pressure my niggas
Just left the club, that shit was weak
Grab me a ho off the street, huh
Wait 'til I leave, I'm finna fuck, beat it 'til I fall asleep (Woo)

Your baby daddy a sucker, ayy, your baby daddy a buster, ayy
Your baby daddy so broke, he hit the plug for a free line of coke
I'm 30 deep with the whole gang, pull up, we bringin' the pain
Fuckin' a bitch, grabbin' her throat, poppin' out all of her veins
Ride a Maybach, not a Mustang, nut on her face, fuck up her bangs
Choke-slam a nigga, like I was Kane, choppa, it sing like ZAYN
Shoot out the roof, no aim
Shoot out the roof, no aim
I want the guap, you can have fame
I make them blue hunnids sing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Two choppas with me, I don't use no pistols (Brr, ooh)
Big, fat Backwood, it look like a missile (Yuh, ooh)
My bitches come when I go blow the whistle (Brr)
Your girl gave me top, and then you gon' kiss her (Damn)
Yeah, I walked in and I'm drippin', it's Fiji (Ooh)
Too much ice on me, the doctor come see me (Damn)
Niggas hate on me, they wish they could be me (Oh shit)
All my cars foreign and they ain't got no ceiling (Woo)
Blow two hunnid bands in a night (Yeah)
Show you how I'm livin' life (Ooh!)
Fuck five hoes, I ain't got a wife (Damn)
Bust down on Napoleon Dynamite (Yeah)
Glacier on my neck, I don't need a light
Pour eight in a two liter, I ain't thinkin' twice
Smoke 20 blunts, yeah, I'm feelin' like a fuckin' kite (Brr)
Put my dick in her, oh shit, yeah, her pussy tight (Chea, chea, ooh)

Shoot out the roof, no aim (Hey!)
I want the guap, you can have fame
I made them blue hunnids sing (Offset!)

I make them blue hunnids talk (Talk to me)
Pinky ring white, look like chalk (White)
I got your bitch, I just bought (Bought)
How much you think in my vault? (How much?)
Chopper with the pump, it got sawed (Brr)
Patek cost a hunnid, oh, Lord (Patek gang)
Diamond VVSs, whoa, whoa (Whoa)
My pockets double-stuffed, it overload (Overload)
Slidin' on your bitch in a peacoat (Slide)
Super Bowl on my fist, subzero (Slide)
Black Bentayga, it's a emo (Woo)
Shootin' dice in Vegas, shoot a free-throw (Whoa)
Bombs in the trap like a C4 (Bombs)
Fuck her in her mouth, wanna de-load (Uhh)
Bitch I'm not the sheep, I'm the big G.O.A.T. (G.O.A.T.)
Go and check the peephole (Woo)
Your baby daddy a sucker, ayy, your baby daddy a buster, ayy
Your baby daddy so broke (Woo, woo, woo, woo), he hit the plug for a free line of coke (Hey)
I'm thirty deep with the whole gang, pull up, we bringin' the pain (Gang, gang, gang)
Fuckin' a bitch, grabbin' her throat, poppin' out all of her veins (We did)
Ride a Maybach, not a Mustang, nut on her face, fuck up her bangs (Gah)
Choke-slam a nigga, like I was Kane, choppa, it sing like ZAYN (Brr)
Shoot out the roof, no aim (Brr)
Shoot out the roof, no aim (Brr)
I want the guap, you can have fame (Guap, guap, guap), I made them blue hunnids sing (Hey!)49Embed
