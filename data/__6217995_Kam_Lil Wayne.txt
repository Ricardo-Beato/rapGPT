17 ContributorsKam Lyrics
Young, young-young (My daddy from New Orleans)
Young, young-young (My mama from L.A.)
Young, young-young (Shoutout to my sister Reginae)

Young Kam Carter, my flow is hotter
Young Kam Carter, my flow is water
Young Kam Carter, my flow is harder
Young Kam Carter, my flow is water
Young Kam Carter, my flow is water
Young Kam Carter, Tunechi my father
Young Kam Carter, my flow is hotter
Young Kam Carter, my flow is water

Young Kam Carter and I got a lot to say
My daddy from New Orleans and my mama from L.A.
I drive to the paint like I'm Dr. J
Got a triple-double just the other day
They ask me if I'm Kobe 'cause I hit the fadeaway
Just scored a three-pointer like I'm B-J
Shoutout to my sister Reginae
Goin' so crazy like I'm FaZe Sway

Young Kam Carter, my flow is hotter
Young Kam Carter, my flow is water
Young Kam Carter, my flow is harder
Young Kam Carter, my flow is water
Young Kam Carter, my flow is water
Young Kam Carter, Tunechi my father
Young Kam Carter, my flow is hotter
Young Kam Carter, my flow is water
