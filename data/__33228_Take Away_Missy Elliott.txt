10 ContributorsTake Away Lyrics
You're so incredible
Ever since the day we became, we became, so personal
Every day that I spend with you, it gets unforgettable
Anything that I did with you, I don't regret at all
(I love everything about you)

Take away (Oh, yeah), your gold and platinum chains
(Oh, and I'm gonna love you baby)
'Cause I'm gon' love (Ooh-ooh), love you anyway
(I ain't in it for the cheddar baby)
I'm not in it for (Oh, no, no), for the love of cash
(You might go broke, but I'm)
'Cause if you go broke (I'm not), I gotta make it last
(Goin' nowhere, nowhere, nowhere)

Listen, let's make, it national
I want the whole world to know I'm with you, and I
I'm in love
Ain't no girl in this world can fill your shoes
None, not at all
The things you do for me is so unbelievable
And you can take away all the platinum chains
You might also like
Take away, your gold and platinum chains (Oh-oh, mhm)
'Cause I'm gon' love, love you anyway
(I'ma love you anyway, yes I am)
I'm not in it for, for the love of cash
(I'm only in it for the love of you)
'Cause if you go broke, I gotta make it last
(I gotta make it last baby, mm)

I just wanna be the perfect match (I just)
You don't even have to ask
(You don't, have to ask)
I just wanna be the (Oh-oh) perfect match
We become so attached
(We become so attached, baby, that's all I ask)
I just wanna be the perfect match
You don't even have to ask
I just wanna be the perfect match
(Be the perfect match, baby)
We become so attached
(So attached)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Now can you hold me, now can you feel me
Now can you get near me
For once in your lifetime, for once in your lifetime
Now can you hold me, now can you feel me
Now can you get near me
For once in your lifetime, for once in your lifetime
Take away, your gold and platinum chains
'Cause I'm gon' love, love you anyway
I'm not in it for, for the love of cash
'Cause if you go broke, I gotta make it lastEmbed
