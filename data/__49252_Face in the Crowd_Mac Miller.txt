24 ContributorsFace in the Crowd Lyrics
Yeah, we gon' start this one like this

Driving down the road with a couple more miles to go
I'm so close but they don't know
Got some freaky hoes and weed to blow
Rock the cleanest clothes
My life different from every single kid you know
Places I go out on my own
Hoes stay blowing up my phone
But, I wanna be left alone
Doing shows, hitting four, five cities in a row
Hit me with some dough, 'cause they know I'm 'bout to blow
You can always say, "No", if you wanna lay low
Girl, you look so good you need to get up on the floor

Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"
You might also like
They tell me it's impossible to do it, I'd be stupid if I tried
But I'm using a maneuver, keep on moving 'em aside
I'm just trying to make some music for the ride
Listen to it when you drive, destination, you arrive
Russell Crow, just a beautiful mind
Got talent, imagine what I'll do with some time
I'm giving you a high feeling, moving your spine
Usually, find me chilling up in Jupiter
I'm so happy when you mad, Khakis, let 'em sag
Mom says, "You could see my ass" and she laughed
Blindfolded on the turnpike, hoping I don't crash
Stashing the weed under the passenger seat
Hope these sixteen wheelers don't crash into me
People taking pictures when I pass in the street
Zoom by, don't fasten my seatbelt
And now you know how we felt (Aha)

Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"

Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"11Embed
