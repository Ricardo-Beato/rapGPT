Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Uhh

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets? What's in your pocketbook?
We think the Bible's a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's so good, need a name? Call it "Milk"
Because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and pussy-ass niggas all day
And I ain't even kinda full

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
You might also like
Woo! I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits
I'll show you my weapon and grill and heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom
She lay down and say, "Let's make a film"
I be like, "Action," I hold her head down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first, you'll get your family killed, that's if you squeal
Pop-pop, close range, hold that gun
Like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch riding my dick
She swerve 'cause another bitch grabbing the wheel
I ask 'em to chill, they both look at me, say "Shut up"
I say "My lips are sealed..."
Oooh! I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in Heaven
When Hell was a pile of wood
I run through Hell with gasoline drawers on
Stop, tell the Devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure
Vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, every day Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese
Been on my beast since I was wearing Wallabees
Where paparazzi? I need my privacy
Fuck your photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get my good side of me, Lord!
I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make a movie 'bout Hollygrove
Woo! Whoever play me
Should get a Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain’t no movie, this is real shit
I don’t need a script 'cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort, more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets
But got "superstar" written all over my face
That's why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
I ain't finished shooting, tell 'em don't check the gate
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her she say "Hallelujah!"
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
"Lord please don’t let this car break down"
Hahahaha
H-Town! Lord, I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th Ward bitch that be boostin'
Sometimes she doze off, that’s the lean, I excuse it
She said "If it ain't ch-chopped and screwed, it ain't music"
She say I never take her out, we went to eat at Houston's
Sometimes I doze off, that's the lean, I'm just snoozin'
I still got Actavis, nigga, that's exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that's a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life, had to do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work
Praying the car don’t break down
Ohhh, Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth
With, codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don't give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon' put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper protecting my livelihood
I'm so good, I'm so straight, I'm secure
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
