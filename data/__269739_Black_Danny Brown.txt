13 ContributorsBlack Lyrics
Dawg you ain't know I'm on some other shit
Not like no nigga, I'm a psycho like no nigga
That don't keep no rifle nigga
Michael Tyson mind-frame when he won the title nigga
Knock out ya grill like you was chewin' loads of peanut brittle
Bitch look like she seen a whistle
Wanna' slurp and lick on me like I'm some sort of popsicle (popsicle)
Tickle me she said I look like Snoop Dizzle
Asked me if I wanted head I said "Fo' shizzle nizzle'
Back up on my grizzle grizzle, pistol and an instrumental
This a detrimental utter lack of fundamentals
You ain't never seen probation, you ain't never seen parole
I rock 'em, sock 'em robot nigga
Keep it moving, toe to toes, broke the mould, poke your holes
Poke your nose and polar flows
Twist a nigga leave him salty like a bag of Rold Gold
44 cold blows, all it took was low blows
Now a nigga fucked up morning toilet seat cold
Used to be fucked up rocks in dunta-dun-daduns
End of money credit living waiting on the first to come
Nigga I will run up on (?)
Now you got tubes in your mouth, Roger Troutman
Nigga you ain't got a choice, used to sound like Barry White
Now it's T-Pain voice
But where Berry Gordy used to crack the top 40's
Now we crack 40's telling yesterday's stories
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo, been on the Calico
In results of taddle-toe
Jump (?) from Mighty Joe
Hidey-hidey-hidey-ho
Cab Calloway ya ho
'Bout doe, if you ain't about money what you came for?
Surgery with chainsaws, nigga I will bang y'all
Catch a nigga Christmas Eve, head leaking Eggnog
Bite a nigga jaw off, while I got the sawed-off
Because you ass and pussy like a bitch with her drawers offYou might also likeEmbed
