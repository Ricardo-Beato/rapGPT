22 ContributorsHigher Up Lyrics
See I was born back in '84
Without a damn clue what was in store
And furthermore even if I could bra
I do it all again real shit bra
Advocate rappin' and doing me
I ended up rapping renewing me
Ended up being better then the last
Whole new Cudder for the new class
Every time I think about the first step I ever took alone made me realize this prince was made for the throne
Defeated the beast, Sword from the stone, smoking so much weed I'm better off alone
In my own zone, in my own zone, I'm so gone never the less
I can't disappear stress, my life is way beyond your momma knows best
You can't forget I'm blessed, the feel is so curse, I can't stop the verse from spitting
Without feeling like I'm phony cause I speak my thoughts every time I think them up
I guarantee I will win if I was ever wrong this moment ain't it
So I am psychic in the in end, I think my thoughts and reality lets them
In, in, in, in

Tell me who, is all ready to go
Tell me who... is all ready to go
Tell me who is all ready, to go higher up say higher up(x2)You might also like7Embed
