25 ContributorsWho Me Lyrics
(This is a KTOE beat)
Real hot girl shit
Hmm, yeah, yeah

Meg who?
Bitch, I got my own money, beg who? (Beg who?)
Beg for what?
I can't remember the last time a nigga really made me nut (Ah)
Dick too weak
If I don't cum three times back to back, then I can't sleep (I can't sleep)
He too cheap
Can't blow a hundred K in one day, he ain't for me (Ayy)
I feel like Biggie, who shot you?
But everybody know who shot me, bitch (Baow, baow, baow)
Now let's stop speaking on that topic
Look at this new shit on my wrist (Look at my wrist)
Look at this AP, look at this Rollie
Who is this bitch that's sayin' she know me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
He heard about me, now he wanna fuck
Mrs. Quick To Make Him Nut, ah
Swallow me, swallow me, swallow me, swallow me
Eat it up, eat it up, freak, freak
Send a picture of this pussy, let him get a sneak peak (Sneak peak)
Oh, if you a freak, freak (Yeah), put this shit on repeat (Repeat)
He say he gon' pop a Perc' and fuck me 'til my knees weak (Blrrrd, ayy)
You might also like
'Fore I pop mine, I'ma give you one too, show me you a real freak (I need a bitch)
Who gon' tote my AR, hide my guns, pills, and weed for me
Backseat of that Jeep, you gotta ride, I hate some weak-ass knees
Thirty K on a vacation, need some head every time we hit the beach
She got French tips on her hand, but she keep pink polish up on her feet
Yeah, I knew she was locked in the day she poured a cup of Wock' with me
As soon as I get mad, I break choppers out, need a bitch that's gon' dump for me
Gon' turn some hoes from Georgia out, now they talkin' like they from Tennessee
But you know Shiest the one and only (Blrrrd, blrrrd), no junior, you cannot mimic him (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
If you see me, it's 'bout three hundred seventy-five shots, we can shoot a film
Yeah, all that shit that pussy said gon' catch up, I can't wait to see him
I sent a bitch, I bet I get him, he too open, you know how it is
Big-ass Backwood back to back, I ain't kill him, we roll up his limb
Everybody I don't like gotta get shot, I'd really hate to be 'em
Oh, you must ain't heard 'bout Fox 13, they call police every time they see 'em
And fuck all the officers and detectives, they know what it is, blrrrd (Fuck 'em, blrrrd)

Big Blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd1Embed
