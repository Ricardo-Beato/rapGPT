38 ContributorsThe City Lyrics
That's black? Whattup God?
Aiyyo Shorty got beef with that nigga? Word?
{​*blam, blam blam*}​ Oh shit!!! Yo!
Hold the fuck up

Aiyyo yo, eight niggas down (just enough)
Fuckin around with my sound (ci-ty)
Yo, bring backup (ci-ty)
Fuckin with me, and mine
Murderous, check it, yo

The world is shifty, we living just enough for the city
The rough witty Killa Bee sting just like the jiggy
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone
Labelled MIA and I send the casualties home
In closed coffins, Wu storming like the light brigade
Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon inside the cyber age
Crime pays, the law's long arm be tryna strong arm
Walking time-bombs that thrive on firearms
The charm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster
We told 'em to show him love and exposed the black toaster
Composer was shook, I took your bad looks for joke
Get your back broke, deep throat this Murder, I Wrote
The antidote be seeking like a buried treasure
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector
Wanted Dead or Alive, Rebel I escapes
Across the desert sand, leaving no footprints to trace
Keep a war face, your place conceal the baby knives
On the North breaks, I still shine in shady times
You might also like
We living just enough (living just enough)
Just enough for the city (for the city)
Just enough for the city

In the jungle, I make moves like Iron Monkey
Plots to bump me off, GOVT on the hunt for me
We stay hungry for money drugs and guns
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs
Know the science be my guidance
The facts tell, gats sell like sex and violence
And break the project silence, a vision
This is way beyond four corners, escape this mental prison
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world
Before the World War explosive bomber, visionary soldier karma
My code of honor, mind still scarred from the drama
Trauma sent to victim, witness them run, scream in horror
Military chopper come gun down the slum
The outcome do or die son, it's bound to come
Mentally aware I see truth within the square
The future's here catch me on computer software
Warfare's inevitable, Rebel I hold several government official
Issue .38 specials, that step through
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle
I may die in the scuffle but I'm taking 40 devils
We livin just enough
Just enough
Just enough
For the ci-ty

Killa Beez, stinging MCs
Yeahhh, Wu4Embed
