10 ContributorsEarring Lyrics
La-la, la-la-la-laa
La-laa, la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-laa
La-laa, la-laa, la-la-la

And one of us gotta crawl under the bus
If we wanna stand a chance of standing up without a crutch
And I ain't trying to sound dismissive of that target you've been squinting at
We've all been aiming far beyond our range of limitations
Even when I try to take the bullet I'm impatient
Looking at your face for validation
Fly like dishes but sleep like strangers
Protect my interests, what you think these fangs for?
This isn't even anger
It's just disappointment pointed in familiar directions
This is tight and stressed like a tightrope stretched
Across my whole chest, this is why I'm flexing
Please forgive my voice but I'm lost in the void
When I look to the future neither one of us enjoying it
We ought to stop and start smelling these flowers
Before the world reminds us that it's not really ours

La-la, la-la-la-laa
La-laa, la-la-la
I wish you could hear me, my lips to your earring
La-la, la-la-la-laa
La-laa, la-laa, la-la-la
I wish you could hear me, my lips to your earring
You might also like
Life is hard
Some stains are too deep to wipe them off
So we must strive for a higher cause
There's something that is clearly missed
Both of us are running from experiences
Frustrated today, nitpicking tomorrow
Sittin' in a sorrow, sippin' from a bottle
Where do we go wrong, why do we prolong
I wanna grab my hat and throw my coat on
We sleep in different beds, we're taking different meds
This relationship is so Night of the Living Dead
I know it's morbid, but there's the mortgage, there's the storage
There's the four kids, I will not forfeit
Whatever, we can make it under pressure
We're both bad with money, we spent the college fund together
I ain't got nothing else to say about it
Let's just pray about it, I mean it

La-la, la-la-la-laa
La-laa, la-la-la
I wish you could hear me, my lips to your earring
La-la, la-la-la-laa
La-laa, la-laa, la-la-la
I wish you could hear me, my lips to your earring1Embed
