2 ContributorsMental Exorcism (Alternate Version) Lyrics
Dope sold on the cut make our hands bleed
Fuck broke, it ain't an option, penitentiary
Or the grave is the only way we fall back
Do our time A.T.W then crawl back
To them streets where we come from, taught life
Look alive, little niggas better walk right
Real with it, quick trigger finger, gun play
I only know how to deal with these niggas one way
And someday I swear to God I'ma change that
But I can't 'cause them evil demons came back
And when I'm high y'all I can't explain
What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
'Cause mayne I've been a loyal dude, and you can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need to talk but there ain't no one to listen
Lost inside a mental exorcism, and wishing...

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast, living life against the grain
Just one time, I wanna clear my mind, the silence seems so loud
If I could, I would fly away and live my life beyond the gray clouds

I woke up from a dream feeling all good
Prayed for better days ahead but what was y'all doing?
Lost, stuck in a standstill waiting for a handout
Hustling for tennis shoe paper, never panned out
My sister trippin', got my grandmother stressing
'Cause she's only 17 and she's already pregnant
Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
B.G.'s is trippin', ain't nothing left to stop them
Uncle in jail, daddy dead and their mamas
Can't teach them how to be men; grow up being followers
The streets swallow them then life overpower them
Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
Crash tested, a dummy high volume
Only God can judge but y'all niggas is comical
90 percent of our future's off in prison
Prescription for my mental exorcism, and listen...
You might also like
Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast, living life against the grain
Just one time, I wanna clear my mind, the silence seems so loud
If I could, I would fly away and live my life beyond the gray clouds

Another kid killed in cold blood, a mother's heart broke
Family crying on the first pew, my heart spoke
Hurtful words I would never dare speak
In the house of the Lord, still I'm in the devil's reach
I don't wanna hear the preacher preach, that shit a lie
Plus he knowing how that evil be, but who am I
To judge a man when I see him try
FOX News tried to justify
It ain't no way that you can clarify
In cold blood our lil homies dying
Another sign of the times but it's terrifying
That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk
Get arrested go to jail go to court and get the fuck off
That shit is fucked off, we worried about the money lost
While the Klan's about to light another cross
I ain't denying it, I speak from intuition
It's also from my mental exorcism, with wisdom

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast, living life against the grain
Just one time, I wanna clear my mind, the silence seems so loud
If I could, I would fly away and live my life beyond the gray cloudsEmbed
