Guwap, huh, hah
Evil Genius, hah, Guwap

Guwop fresh up off of paper
Now I'm reading the paper (Huh)
I'm sorry I've been busy (Sorry)
I've been out here chasing paper (Money)
I like em' sassy and pretty (Sassy)
Them Keishas and Keshas (Uh)
You'll get cropped out the picture (Huh?)
Like Puff did the Kardashians (Well damn)
Diamond flash without the flash (Flash)
Off in the hood playin' scratch (Uh)
Chopper leave, neck come out all red (Red)
You know El Gato hate rats
And the word around town that you talking down (Down)
They see me talk down, then they broke down (Down)
Don't fuck with them clowns, yeah (Clown)

Money keep on callin' me, callin' me (Money)
Money keep on callin' me, callin' me (Money)
Money keep on callin' me, callin' me (Money)
Money keep on callin' me, uh (Money)
Feel like money keep following me, yeah (Money)
Money keep on callin' me (What?)
Money keep on callin' me (Yeah)
Money keep on callin' me (Yes)
Money keep on callin' me, callin' me (Money)

Money keep on callin' me (Callin' me)
Money keep on callin' me (Heyo)
Money keep on callin' me (Yes)

The money is calling, the money is calling
She sassy and pretty, she thick like I like them
Chilly with ice on, they been on the drip
Glacier McLaren that runs all our crew
When I'm in Seaport, I sell 'em the krippy
Think that she hippy, she wanna be Kylie
Can't lie, a cutie, they call me "Your Highness"
My friends call me Fiji, I'm covered with diamonds
Take food off my plate, don't make that mistake
Conquer the hate 'cause I'm rulin' they fate
One of the greats, I'm known for the flake
The wedding cake, I flew it in from L.A
All in the D, balling like Blake
Or Blake with the Clippers like back in the day
Scarface with the flake, watching the gate
The money is callin', I cannot be late, yeah

Money keep on callin' me, callin' me (Money)
Money keep on callin' me, callin' me (Money)
Money keep on callin' me, callin' me (Money)
