10 ContributorsTrap Goin Crazy Lyrics
Trap going crazy, going crazy
Going crazy, this bitch bunking
The work came early, on Thursday
So Friday, I'm gettin' money
Checks came next day, on Saturday
It's payday, the J's coming
Sunday my off day, I ball all day
I smoke all day, then big stuntin' every weekend

Atlanta, twist ya fingers up, bangin' like a center
My diamond necklace swingin' like a thrilla in Manila
Index look like Christmas, pinky cold as winter
See the frozen crystals when I hit the cigarillo
Remember, I'm a genius, not like Washington and wizards
Not from Pittsburgh, PA, but your girl on my pestila
In my red Ferrari, sittin' on spinners, tinted windows
Blinkin' like a blinker, on the seats are my initials
Prolly seeking, you can see me with these Puerto Ricans in bikini
It feel like I'm cheating 'cause I'm trick or treating
Sittin' on skinnies in my Lamborghini while you dream of genie
As I'm leaning and the carats gleaming and the sun is beaming
Gucci

Trap going crazy, going crazy
Going crazy, this bitch bunking
The work came early, on Thursday
So Friday, I'm gettin' money
Checks came next day, on Saturday
It's payday, the J's coming
Sunday my off day, I ball all day
I smoke all day, then big stuntin' every weekend

The red guy is rolling so it's hotter than a sauna
All the boys and girls gotta get up off the corner
Feds got ya picture and your partner snitching on ya
Baby mama bitching and she wishing that you fumble
Pounds in the trash bag, tell me what's the number
Pills in a knapsack, chickens in the Hummer
Trap house bunking, I done made another hundred
You better count ya money 'cause it's Christmas in the summer
A hundred eight degrees, I'll have you outside in a bomber
The middle of July, I make it winter in the summer
Cocaina clinic, got it snowing like Nebraska
Zone 6 East Atlanta, man, we call this shit Alaska

Trap going crazy, going crazy
Going crazy, this bitch bunking
The work came early, on Thursday
So Friday, I'm gettin' money
Checks came next day, on Saturday
It's payday, the J's coming
Sunday my off day, I ball all day
I smoke all day, then big stuntin' every weekend

I'm in the kitchen, homie, whipping up a deuce
Niggas looking sick, I call it chicken noodle soup
Chickens in the living room, we call it the chicken room
Birds everywhere, it's looking like Atlanta zoo
Pounds in a stash bag, chickens in the coupe
Birds like a petshop, got pigeons on the roof
Working with the fork, turn a one into a two
How ya niggas snitching, gotta watch out for ya crew
Find me on 2-85, flying around the loop
If you want to smoke, holla at me for the fruits
If you want the X, holla at me for a few
I'm standing over pots like ya mama cooking food
Trap going crazy, going crazy
Going crazy, this bitch bunking
The work came early, on Thursday
So Friday, I'm gettin' money
Checks came next day, on Saturday
It's payday, the J's coming
Sunday my off day, I ball all day
I smoke all day, then big stuntin' every weekend1Embed
