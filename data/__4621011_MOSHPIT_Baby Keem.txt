Think I got a sense for a mosh pit
Likes on the 'Gram make a bitch think she poppin'
Ayy, and I keep a cock for a thick bitch
Beat around the bush, I keep a mop for a misfit

Ayy, goin' soul searchin' with the demons
Murder in July, my mama made me mind my business
I don't follow my ex on Instagram
Cancelled out my life if you fishin' for attention
Bitch, my grandma love me, so a nigga straight
I don't need a lil' bae, Baby Keem stay patient
Uh, always looking out for the fake
Add a stranger to my list of familiar faces
Gang, gang, gang, I live a lifestyle (Yeah, yeah)
Your bitch wanna fuck me, want this dick cause I'm famous (Yeah)
Uh, Baby Keem got you niggas shook
Ten trap phones 'cause the feds takin' notice
Bitch, I had a long night, where you at, ho?
Lettin' her in my life and she got me losin' focus (Yeah)

Think I got a sense for a mosh pit
Likes on the 'Gram make a bitch think she poppin' (Yeah, yeah)
Ayy, and I keep a cock for a thick bitch
Beat around the bush, I keep a mop for a misfit

Bro

I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro

I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
Stupid bitch

Stupid bitch, top, when I'm hot, it's a tandem
Fake niggas drop, let they hoes call me handsome
And I don't fuck with a snake, he's an actor
Started getting paid, now my jersey's in the rafters
Take cover when I take off on you
Pimp shit, I lose it, then get my payoff on you, uh
That's how I floss, three nigga 'round me when I shop
Pull up, I got one night off
I'ma hit it, then you're blocked, ayy

I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
Look, I know I'm wrong
We're both wrong
Just call me back, Keem8Embed
