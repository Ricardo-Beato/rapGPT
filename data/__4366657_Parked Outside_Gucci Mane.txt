5 ContributorsParked Outside Lyrics
I parked right out front to see me when you walked out
Im in the candy old school with the music up loud
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Just wait until you see what i got parked outside

Now my vette is on Ashanties and my dunk is on crutches
The hummers on 8s just to make your bitch thirsty
Outside now is a cutlas on buttons
It got so much pound you girl eardrums busting
A shool boy chevy and the rims are off mustard
A 66 muzzle got it smellin down cuesta
The lamb hit morlen plaza needing more bubble
Ridin tinted windows cuz my fan base doubled
I dropped the top in the summer bitches in trouble
Before the door slam my 74 burnt rubber
Next light i seen the chick candy red rover
Pulled up let the window down pull over

I parked right out front to see me when you walked out
Im in the candy old school with the music up loud
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Just wait until you see what i got parked outside
You might also like
See the rims so tall i feel im bout to fall bown
I gotta quarter pound of kush im finna blow the house down
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside

Now the outsides candy but the insides oustrich
You homeboys hate it but his girlfriends jockin
Red light red stop sign dont stop it
Quarter back DUB stop it keep goin
A/c blowin feelin like its snowin
Now where im goin even im not knowin
But yo girlfriend is damn sho nosey
She lookin in my car so i left the door open
Im gettin chosen
Baby girl throat me
1 mile later got baby girl chokin
Rims skinny tires got me slidin like lotion
Im so high still im so focused
I seen a red bone in a earth-toned lotus
I said im Gucci Mane la flare she said already knowin
I seen a red bone in a earth-toned lotus
I said im Gucci Mane she said Im already knowin
I parked right out front to see me when you walked out
Im in the candy old school with the music up loud
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Just wait until you see what i got parked outside

See the rims so tall i feel im bout to fall bown
I gotta quarter pound of kush im finna blow the house down
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outside
Baby wait until you see what i got parked outsideEmbed
