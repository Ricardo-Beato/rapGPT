2 ContributorsIntro (The Jukebox) Lyrics
Ahem, ahem
Check, check, 1, 2, 1, 2
I'm comin' through okay, bruh?
Aight, I'm 'bout to do this lil' intro thing, aight
Ayo, what's up y'all? It's the kid, Mac Miller
That high school rapper y'all love
For a lot of y'all, this your first time meetin' me
And for a lot of y'all, y'all been listening for a lil' bit
I just wanna tell everybody this
This hip-hop shit right here, I live it
A hunnid percent point-blank motherfuckin' period
I ain't got no other options, I ain't got no backup plan
This is it for me
Everything I spit on the track, that's my life and how I see shit
So welcome to the motherfuckin' jukebox
Lay back in ya seat, spark a L, call your favorite shawty over, heh
We gon' have a good time
It's only gettin' better from here, Q, haha1Embed
