Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Niggas 'bout to run up in your house in a drought

Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Niggas 'bout to run up in your house in a drought

Every morning I wake up in a bad mood
Attitude fucked up, he's a bad dude
No emotion, numb, wanna lace 'em up
Step out the door like a warrior facing up (what)
Embrace fate, can't wait till I see your brains
You can't look into my eyes, try and you'll see
I'm made of stone, you got a heart of glass, keep your distance
I set the tone on the crescent moon soon, bitches
Growing up in the cut, soaking gangs vital
So insane, pick your brain cannibal style
The nightmares that I'm livin', wouldn't wish on you
Piece is rare like a steak, man, piss on you
Puttin' up bombs, bitch, I hope you fall off
Squeeze, click, bang, body gets hauled off
Send the dogs on you 'fore you get slaughtered
I'm laughing at you, when I hit my J, I'm all off
You might also like
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Niggas 'bout to run up in your house in a drought

Stay the course, see I hit the trouble head on
Staying hungry but your fear is what I fed on
What I'm holdin'? Dumb if you pop your chest
Lights out, see the ex or a family crest
Broken dreams what I see when my eyes open
Life's mundane, I'm just going through the motions
See the dream, I want the nightmares come to life
Fighting my demon, heard a voice coming to the light
Soul burning like coal in a steam engine
Silence my enemies swift with a clean endin'
The way Tammy looking for somethin' upliftin'
Intoxicated by the bloodlust, fuck slippin'
I was raised like a Nomad, stay driftin'
Two wheels, sideways bitch, heart skippin'
I'm fire with the ice, hit you twice, no quarter
Eliminate these motherfuckers in no order (yeah)
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the groundEmbed
