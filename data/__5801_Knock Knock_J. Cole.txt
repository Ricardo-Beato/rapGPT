36 ContributorsKnock Knock Lyrics
Yea
We fresh off motherfuckin South Beach
Yea, uh

Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello, my name is Cole", I'm walking right up in, and well no
Don't give a fuck if you gon' hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit too many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text "let's chill", how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby, you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that through the body good dick
Feeling like I got game that karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'ma talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up
Ay, so what up
Hey, you heard that huh?
Oh you ain't heard of me? Well I prefer that
Uh, I text my number to you did you get that?
Huh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back
And I'll fix that
Tell me is you with that, hey
Ay tell me is you with that
Ay tell me is you with that
Yeah, ay baby is you with that? YeaYou might also like8Embed
