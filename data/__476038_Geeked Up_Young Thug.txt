13 ContributorsGeeked Up Lyrics
Geeking up with Thug, popping like a cork
These shoes on my feet, you cannot afford
This drink in my cup, I went overboard
 got them choppers, shooting at you like a sport
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up

Molly tan sand,  I taking pictures of my principal
A foreign class mate, I'mma look her up in literature
I peek up on her desk cause I heard she got a camel toe
I found out she was nothing and she want to fuck my vehicle
Me and lay in presidential suite with fifty fleece
I got a mansion on south beach like I play with the fucking Heat
So many bitches call my phone my ringtone is a beep
And I ain’t never been a Christian but got racks on my feet
Wendy Williams, I’m a charger, Imma slow up
My bitch hot like the sign at Dunkin Donuts
A hundred for a shave, fuck them designer cuts
I got on Ferragamo boxers, these designer nuts
You might also like
Geeking up with Thug, popping like a cork
These shoes on my feet, you cannot afford
This drink in my cup, I went overboard
 got them choppers, shooting at you like a sport
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up

Popped up, looking like Batman
Weed so loud it sound like the ambulance
That that woo-woo
Full pocket fat, that that brew brew
My wrist two scoops, bless these hoes like “hachoo”
Me and Thugga baby, on my A-Town baby
I was born at Gravy
Let’s go crazy on em
I been a little hated on
Heard they been hating on him
I been dranking commas
Geeking up with Thug, popping like a cork
These shoes on my feet, you cannot afford
This drink in my cup, I went overboard
 got them choppers, shooting at you like a sport
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
This one here geeked up
