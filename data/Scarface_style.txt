There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that!
Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah

Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!

Won't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now)
Just smile (And the next generation)

Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine9th grade
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!
Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

Fuck the world, as we unloading, witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhale the sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is "Fuck friends!" – we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

Smile, smile for me
All you need to do is smile
Woooo smile for me
Come on, smile for me36Embed
Take time out to tell everybody that been bumping my shit for the past thirteen years, that I love that man, I appreciate that
Every motherfucking body that was in my corner, comparing me to the greats, you know in the game, I appreciate that too man
Umm...
I've got too many motherfuckers to name, so I'll just say I appreciate y'all, y'hear?
Alright

You was playin' when you was sayin' you was ready
I'm knowin' you ain't mean it when you told me you was tired of life
And just wanted to leave it you was drinkin'
So I ain't really pay it no attention
Took you back to your crib and dropped you off
With the intention of gettin' with this Asian bitch
I’ve been off in Visionz, somethin' exquisite
I had to spit that game, she was vicious
I'm hoppin' back on 6-10 punchin' the drop
On my way out to her house I started noticing cops
Somethin' tellin' me to turn around and follow these dudes
Normally I wouldn't consider but out of the blue I'm bustin' a U
I get off where they get off at
Well-familiar with these streets, this where I came up at
Roadblocks, yellow tape, "a crime scene" they say
What the fuck just happened? I just left this place...
I get out and started walkin' askin' Frog, "What's up?"
Lookin' at me dazed like, "Face, it's all fucked up..."
I move a little closer tryin' to see who it is
And I saw his baby mama in tears holdin' his kids...

I ain't﻿ whole in the inside I'm hurting I can't explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies I'm knowing this ain't how my life's supposed to be

And it was then it finally hit me
I'm standing here nervous as I can be
It was nothing that can prepare me for what I'm finna see
I'm praying this is a dream and I'm bout to awake
But the closer I got the more I realize fate
Wasn't fair to change for me
And why would I think so
My homie had a date with death
He had to make though
I'm feelin' eerie, I'm liftin' up the yellow tape
By the time I get to the scene
They rollin' this away
I wonder whats under this sheet, my knees get weak
To the point I had to take me a seat
This shit's deep
When they put a nigga down that you was raised around
What was once a minor statement's turnin' major now
Never woulda thought in years that my homie was suicidal
Had it all; money and kids and a wife that read the bible
They say it's life and death in the tongue
He had his reasons I shoulda believed him
Anotha soul no longer breathin'
Hate to say it but this one been heavy on my conscience
My nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense
I ain't﻿ whole in the inside I'm hurting I can't explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies I'm knowing this ain't how my life's supposed to be

And everybody thinkin' it's murder, but homicide sayin' self-inflicted
By the way the body was sitting, brains in the kitchen
Who coulda predicted
But the detectives who was fishin'
Fucked up that the family had to see dad in his position
All I remember was us doin' what we did
To survive in these streets where we lived
We was kids growin' up in this environment
Nothing but trouble
You either struggled or you hustled
Folded the bubble
Grade school til we dropped out, we had a plan
We was either finna be rich or die like a man
We did it all for the love of the hood, every journey
Imagine seein' your dawg lifeless across a gurney
I wonder what was goin' on
You shoulda said that you was feelin' mad
I coulda talked you outta that
But never will I see you again
Nor will your kids
Nor will your family or your friends
It's the end
Not even words I write in this song
Can right that wrong
My nigga is gone and life goes on
I ain't﻿ whole in the inside I'm hurting I can't explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies I'm knowing this ain't how my life's supposed to be1Embed
Trouble seems to catch a motherfucker with his cards down
Gotta keep my drawers up, shit's gettin hard now
These motherfuckin cops be plantin shit on these niggas
Simply because these niggas got bank accounts that's bigger
I just can't get no peace from you motherfuckin rollers
Every time I pull my Benz-o out, you pull me over
I'm sick of motherfuckers who be jocking Whitey's coattails
Blacker than a motherfucker, sweat me 'bout my dope-sales
Niggas just take your cut and get your ass up out my face
The only thing you probably get from me is a cock-sucking pistol case
Unless you plan on plantin a lil' somethin in my shit
Just because you ain't got shit, bitch!
Give em a badge and a trigger and that makes em figure
That they can fuck with a million dollar nigga
They got you mixed up, fixed up at the Segas, shookin Indo
Gettin fucked up in the gank-hole
The only way you'll whip that motherfucker is when you whip that motherfucker
And we choke the motherfucker (Man, fuck that motherfucker!)
So when you hear my song and wanna get it on
You better come prepared motherfucker, you dyin wit'cha boots on

Just because we're niggas and they figure we're no smarter
We'll sell each other out, and start rattin' on our partners
They start bringin up shit that happened back in '85
And then comes the largest jury, bitch, they fuckin time!

They ain't ready for this y'all
Yeah

Ghetto niggas remain violent (Remain violent), all the killers remain silent (Remain silent)
Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling (Ain't smiling)
And I'm driving to a place they all roamin'
The lake we build houses, but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto, the only place a motherfucka will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the 'Face
Where niggas do they struggle  with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons died in
You could run it, but can't hide it, so step aside
It's the nigga that makes music for the streets
'Cause I love this mothafucka like pussy with no sheets, 'cause it's deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface
They let the money make 'em nervous, what's the purpose?
A mothafucka sitting on fat
Who done came up out the hood, money can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me then take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
'Cause off in these streets, I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a ki doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this mothafucka deeper
Fear the Reaper, that no man born of woman harm me
Fuck beat these niggas in your army, though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this 'cause it loves me
Let it be, stop looking at this mothafucka strange
And talking 'bout a mothafucking change

We ghetto niggas, can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little Jay down at Rap-A-Lot
My phone tapped, the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto, that's my life
You see that house on the lake, it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna

Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)

Put me inside a casket, you dirty bastards
Until the day I die, you catch a nigga high off weed, the police can't find me
My shit is dropping and I'll sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game, they caught up in this drug dealing
Now how can I fall? how can I ball?
How can I catch my enemies and murder 'em all?
My words of flame, burn niggas inside their brain
Niggas can't hang with me, and nuttin's changes, uh
Scarface got me on this shit
We lace heat, mothafuckas in they body and face, uh
Growing quicker, liquor, made me your daddy, your nigga
Niggas don't wanna see me worldwide, mob figure

Niggas, don’t wanna see me, when I got weed in my system
Catch another victim, catchin' bodies
Bring a shotty to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit 'cause it's wrong but we born right
And to these niggas in my zone, we do it long ways
'Til these bitches understand nigga my song pays; 'cause I'm the man
Now these is my homeboys, we outlaws 'til the day we die
Keep this shit, rough and raw

Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid, be one a' your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people

It's always your own people
It's always your own people

I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us

I know you hate me, don't you?
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You'd probably rather see me die in the game
You'd probably rather see me die in a plane
Than to see me up on top of my dough
I get my money, shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But I'mma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'm a starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, well I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggas know I
Don't believe in letting shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
With a homeboys demeanor
But let the bullshit come between us
Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? And if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?

Can't understand my city's under siege
F-A-C-E-M-O-B screamin' 'cause I mean it
'Til these motherfuckers bury me
37-40 pull that pistol packin'
Gun slangin', bangin' Southside
Heat bringer, heat slanger

Head banger, jaw re-arranger, the bitch strangler
A total stranger in your face with this thing aimed at ya
You're facin' danger, 16 with one up in the chamber
I'm 'bout to stain ya, with this motherfuckin' handgun

And fuck them laws
They got my brother already, they can suck my balls
Average nigga have no luck at all
But because I be in my 'Lac chillin'
They stereotype me thinkin' I'm into crack sellin'

Man, I'm Windy City 2-20, anybody chin checker
3rd floor Lake Grove, 35th in leather gloves

Rollin', ridin', slowly slidin'
Creepin' up in the corners where you hoes be hidin'
Takin' you over in ways you never even thought of
The city's under siege, nigga, don't get caught up

I'm a 4th Ave Lake Street ridin' ass nigga
Still a ? superior executioner
The bomb M-I-D-W-E-S-T marauder
Killer with the Triple Goose gun compartment

Ghetto birds hover over South Side Chicago
Ellis Park killin' fields, gang war rival
Bigger than the Sears Tower, I was a pain in the smoke
They found his body floatin' the lake shore

Eight holes filled up his body full of hot ones
Shot one, two, three, four, down like dominoes
Cop killin', Colombian necktie vic
Split, throat slit, it's over with

I said a hip-hop
Pour a cup of coffee and then I'll sip and stop
Because we're gettin' watched by some new group
New booty MC's walkin' around like you and me
But all they do is listen to shit only a fool'd believe

2-75, big fat and nasty, fuck bein' classy

All he ever known was trouble
His mama never kept a job his daddy died in struggle
He had a sister cute as fuck that liked this older cat
That had control over the hood, but never sold a pack
The family needed money, asking him if he could fronted
He wants to learn the game, cause being broke ain't feed em nothing
They met and talked him in, and one more thing before we finish
You don't know me I don't know you thats how we'll start and end it
From there he's off and running, taught him how to save his money
Never let one meet the other don't meet paper bleed and run it
You'll learn the basic rules, don't sell this to kids or fools
And don't you try it either, honor that and all is cool
Now he a baller dude, strippin hoes are callin dude
Addicted to the boy, shootin up and snorting too

Boy meets girl, and falls in love
In this world of hate and war
Girl meets boy, and falls in love
So let stay together, play together days forever babe
Ok, a deeper subject, titty dances seen in public
Daytime she's off in school, trying to get a degree in something
She's beautiful, after all that she's been thru
I heard he father used to rape the girl and beat her too
A man a wife a kid, a car a dog and crib
The perfect world if you was outside, you was looking in
Somehow she got the blame, kicked her out the house and rain
Began to fall and no one ever thought she'd be the same
Her hate for men was evident, but it was prevalent
Cause where she worked had dudes that always asked her, to come home with them
Ain't look for love but fell in love inside a topless club
She met a thug, that had the drug, and that was all it was

Addiction follows, so in love that all the leaves are hollow
Plus nothing else exists, just speed ball and the needle swallow
A mix of different worlds, I know you thought when boy met girl
That this meant no regrets, but Romeo let Juliet
Say those words that and made him think that it was cool to try
But you know you don't get high, on what you supply
And heroin's next to kin, ain't a bag of coke
But when her world met up with his they both was comatose'd
A tragic ending, to a couple, that was oh so close
Stopped short a happiness, cause they combined and overdosedEmbed
Man, what's up with these niggas out here
Mad at us 'cause we on top

And stop hatin' me, fuckin' with my shit 'cause I got more hustle than you
Get yours, get yours baby

Know what? I'm makin' moves, puttin' cash behind plans
To blow up, will he style like this
Everyday I parlay, sip Henny and Tanqueray
Stay in the mix like Alizé

On the prowl again to get honeys familiar with the smile again

Shit's thick, its time to run for shelter

Dear diary, I'm runnin' outta pages
Fadin', in and out, takin' purple hazes

Red skies institute, the silent horns playin'
I'm prayin' with tears in my eyes

Woo! This for the block, boy!
Take a breath... Woah!

Every day, it's been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle, 'cause that's how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block, to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On your block, you pro'ly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B-I, your homeboys from knee-high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dog, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was "Creepy"
If Black June could see me, he'd be tripping
And I'd bet he still try to tease me

My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy

And when you wake up on the couch, you going right back at it
On my block, when you're that fucked up, they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my mama goes back inside
Then we can fly, pass it around a few times to get high

My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy

And once your mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set your ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets, shellshocked
Who never quite got right; now, they inhale rocks
On my block, it's like the world don't exist
We stay confined to this small, little section we living in
Oh, my block, I wouldn't trade it for the world
'Cause I love these ghetto boys and girls
Born and raised on my block

For life, nigga

Uh, spent 75 on some cakes

27 in the OZ's, the bag weighs a gram
Walk a tight rope 'cause the feds is watchin' me
'Cause I'm slingin' more dope than a pharmacy
I got it on wholesale, takeover's the target
Straight snow sale, nigga, floodin' the market
And I can give a fuck, nigga, if you wanna tussle
Jealous of my figures, you're best to check your hustle
We can get down if you run up

Look in my eyes, you see the vision of a nigga
Feelin' trapped in his inner self (It's fuckin' with my mental health)
Born in the city where the niggas die young
Mist-covered street corners collapsed where I slung
And everybody standin' stiff waitin' on the cake
I'm waitin' on a motherfuckin' break, ain't no escape
Make no mistakes and leave a motherfucker breathin'
They all got to die this evening, 'cause I believe in
You kill a motherfucker 'fore a nigga come through
With his crew makin' your nightmares come true
Now who gon' be the first to die
'Cause I'd extinguished your whole clique
Gimme the money, nigga, no shit

Now I'm havin' dreams of firin' at them lames
I used to have dreams of retirin' from the game
Now as fast as I got it, I'ma lose it
See, the cash and narcotics, uh, made me ruthless
Timer know the real, they heard the situation
About the drama in the Ville, I'm third generation
Now they wanna put a jacket on my risen hustle
'Cause I couldn't hack it livin' in the struggle
Now I live every minute like my last one
Labeled a menace and a threat, and I'ma blast 'em

I come from the '80s, so I rep my hood
I'm a gangsta 'til I'm dead and so it's understood
That if I died tryna get it, it was time then
Don't nobody shed tears, that was how it went
It's for them young cats and them old dudes
This is soul food for your soul, fool
Like I told you, I gotta represent
For my boys doing time, state and fed pen
Stiff as a dead man, you know the rules, dawg
You take these stories to the grave, we don't do logs
And we don't talk to police, take your shoes off
And we don't talk to police, take your shoes off
These dudes soft, so they cop pleas
They hot boys, hot boys, so they watch me
I'm not free, I've got wings
Don't let me ride sweet chariot, stop and swing slow

You said you ain't no rich nigga — I don't believe you
You ain't no snitch nigga — I don't believe you
I've been the shit, nigga — I never seen you
You tryna hide behind that badge? You're lookin' see-through

I know niggas workin', know niggas steal and rob
Know niggas rockin' quarter ki's off of jelly jars
They sell it soft, 'cause when you sell it hard
Them federali boys hit niggas with hella charges
Regardless, if you ain't did shit
Then you shouldn't have said shit, but you said shit
'Cause I done read this
Bitch, you need your motherfuckin' head split
To the deadness, you dead, bitch
You don't exist, I smell fish
Like a funk hole, a punk, though
This punk sold his soul for a lesser charge
Thought that he was real but this figure here was just a broad
He's stressin' hard, but here's the lesson, y'all
Watch these motherfuckers 'cause they plottin' tryna catch us all
Ain't no confessions, dawg, they try to question y'all
Tell 'em read your rights and let you go 'cause you can't help at all

You live by the same thing you die for
What you ride for?
I'm an old school cat from the Southside, so I tote two
Five-shot titanium tramp fin sevens
When they get charged, brain get split like melon on the sidewalk
Pussy, you frog, I could see you
Talk that big shit but you see-through
Don't believe you, need more people
I was fed with the game, you was fed with seafood
The evils that we do
Looks can deceive you, words to take heed to
I leave you to read through
Swing down sweet chariot, stop, we need you

Young 'Face slangin' yay every day
Heavyweight, got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind nonstop 'til I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas, stay the fuck up out my way
I be true OG, you can quote what I say
I'm a H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, ridin' dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I don't gangbang, I control the game
What I'm representin' here is puttin' holes in brains
Oh, I'll say the same thing, I'll be old and gray
'Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Grippin' grain, poppin' trunks, dawg, that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in '83
I stay street, when it's done, that's that
You can find me in your hood pumpin' monster crack
I roll over rodents and Rovers with rims on 'em
Sniffing out a rat, I expose them and then dome 'em
A lotta niggas bitches that claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy that claims that he knows me
A C.I. puttin' out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets, he gots to squat to pee
Got the feds on his team, so they watchin' me

Don't pop pills either 'cause that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a Mad Dog before we went to school
Clique up back then, I was smashing boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
'Cause if I slap one ho, then her man was next
I'm a kick-door robber, a hot-shot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If it's there to be made, then I'm finna make it
But if it ain't no way, then believe I'm finna take it
'Cause a nigga with no hustle in him worthless, Jack
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
I've been good at bullshittin' but this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain, mayne, he lost

Now the subject of this story is about these boys
Runnin' 'round talkin' 'bout how they ride these cars
I was sitting in the Benz at the age of 19
When I was 21, I had a yellow Ferrari
22, I was Porsche'in' with the top let back
23 in a Rolls with the pipe to match
24, I wasn't trippin' what I came up in
I was focusing on how to be like James back then
Money, power and respect was the life I chose
Being famous wasn't nothin', I just liked my dough
I was livin' in the fast lane, mayne, for sho'
Short temper, quick to up and let this thing unload
So if I had a problem with you, you to blame, you know
Saw the message and then this nigga's brain explodes
So if you see a nigga, holla at me passin' by
Chunk the deuce when I leave and don't be askin' why
I've been straight for a long time
Gettin' cake for a long time
Me and J for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
Been a G for a long time

Never letting nothing stand in the way of me riding
Animal instinct intentions whenever we grinding
We criminally minded, I'll squeeze ya blindly
Body parts deteriorated when they find ya
Here's your death certificate, might as well sign it
The ending, I'm the reaper, why you hiding?
I'm violent, I strike with the force of a bomb
And right when you least expect it I come
Uh, I know you see the fire in my eyes
The hunger, the hate, I'm trapped inside, now die
Everybody in here gotta die
Ain't nobody in here escapin' my nine
Ain't no sense in hiding', you wasting my time
Bitch, I gotta handle, I came to get mine

6 million ways to murder choose 
I prefer the method of using a 12 gauge
And blades crack open your rib cage, shawty
High off of wanting' this weed and black mildly
The hardcore following is raising dead bodies
Murder Inc. in the muthafucka like Irv Gotti

My woman got my back so I ain't stressed out
Side looking in, you can say I’m blessed huh
Career still intact got my street cred
Went on with life thinking that the beef’s dead
But every now and then I get flash backs
Get down on my knees and I ask that
God keep my head on cuz I dont wanna spaz out
Load back up that 45 and air a nigga, ass out

Staring down the barrel of a Colt .45

I'm lost I got blood on my hands, though

Snap back to reality
I gotta think fast, got some motherfuckers after me


Paranoid, got me running for my life now
Homicide, questioning my mama and my wife now
Parking lot, full of cops, got the dogs out
Running, chest burning, out of breath
About to fall out
Hit the corner, parked car at the stop sign
Going back to jail ain't the plan so the outline
Is to come up with something so I escape this or hand cuffs
Fuck that I ain't gonna take shit
I rather be carried by 6 than judged by 12 getting that cell
Or maybe they gon' gun a nigga down
Cause they don't wanna see me in the trial

If I had to play God for a day
I would open up the gates, let the world see my face
Remove all doubt from the ones without the faith
And put them on the path of the straight
A safe place, for the young to come out if they want to play
I'd let their mommas know that they ok
And when y'all pray, I'll respond so you can all see a sign
And answer every pray one at a time
If I'm God huh, all the stabbings all the war would come to cease
My whole entire hood would be at peace, no more beef
And you could sleep without the fears of being woke
By the sounds of sirens, screams of people being smoked
No more dope you don't need it, you'll be cured of all diseases
Your whole entire life would be deleted
Please forgive me I've been dreaming
And rudely interrupted by the demons
Laughed at the picture I was seeing on the ceiling

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face

Just imagine if the devil had a day

Will the dark angel's evil show you grace

Be careful of the choices that you make, cause one day
You'll be standing on your feet and then the next
You're underneath the sheet greeting death
I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest
Stealing breath, shortening my days even less
Lost souls never rest, a killer walks the streets seeking flesh
A adolescent hangs she's depressed
A priest who confessed, a judged typing a nigga in a text
Your honor, what the fuck did you expect?
A father kills his son look at life it's a mess
Just imagine what would happen if the lord up and left

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has face
When all that you believed in was a lie
Are you willing to accept it when you find out
Or try to reason with yourself that's what it is when it's not
And all the whole while it's been a plot
To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
That they keep us in the dark on how they act
We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap
Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasn't that
The church and these politics they all full of crap
It's a shame but that's how were blaming it's for the scratch
So I don't knock I'm tryna to put a black card in my wallet
But some dollars in my pocket ain't the topic
Y'all need to stop it
This is just crazy these little babies ticking time bombs
Walking around the lunchroom pulling guns
If momma and daddy took the time to raise their son
Then the sister wouldn't be the mom before she twenty-one huh

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows

My hands got powder burns I just murdered a man
Took his life over nothing if you ask me fuck em (fuck em)
It was him or either me so I saw fit to empty out the clip in this bitch fuck the dumb shit
Now do I feel guilt no I don't think so
Light another cigarette, zonin out I seen folks
Streetlights glowin' in my rear view watchin'
Cause I'm paranoid thinkin' that I might have been spotted
As I pass by Watkins I relax cause I'm home now
Had a funny feeling in the beginning it's gone now
Cause we live in a do or die society
You do or either die tryin' or do it psychologically
I'm brain dead and I don't give a fuck that's my excuse
And I don't need a audience around for me to let loose
You plex fool, I catch you then I stretch you
Out in front ya door step and vanish like a ghost

I'm a bad mother (shut yo mouth)
Ain't no limit to what I earn
If it ain't money why should I be concerned
Burn is what my enemies do, just like weed
223 g's, just to bleed, yes indeed

Run up off in them bushes, watch motherfuckers kill ya'll
This shit here is real dog, believe me I got you
Lined up in my cross-hairs so I shot you
A dead man speaks no words, that's some true shit
The courtrooms the hood, the street life ruthless
All done for the dope and dollar signs
No witnesses no motherfuckin' crimes

That minute that you had to pray it should of stopped you
You must want your death wish fulfilled so I got to
I'm a killer nigga push me if you want fool
And only God knows when I catch you what I'm gone do
Think its a game when I cock & aim
And it pops and bangs
And it's out with brains
Shit is not the same
What you expected was a spark dog, but not the flame
I can stop the rain
And you can learn a whole lot from a dummy
You can't squat, duck or run and hide from me
So your best bet is coming correct
Show respect or get a hole in yo chest, with no regrets
I rather die than let a nigga slide
And I put that on my son only five (aha ha)
The only things I've ever cherished in life
I let them go it a'int nothing left but fighting (right)

Don't get me wrong ya'll I love females
That come around but after while, I need some self (ya feel me)
I know I'm selfish at times but bottom line, move around if that ain't how you get down
Plus my album coming out real soon, I'm in the studio daily tryna write these tunes
And for you to stress a nigga like I'm running these hoes is outta line
Im out of your life, pack up your clothes and go

All I ever wanted was for him to see
That I was all the woman he would ever need
I've given all of me so unselfishly
And now he's at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I go
I'm about to hit some spots with my guys from outta town
And there you go making those mean old eyes
Kinda feel like I'm in prison sometimes
Like my freedom is gone like I've committed a crime and that's some bullshit
You watch a nigga like I'm 6 years old, how the fuck you think this shit gon' grow
I'm a tell you how this shit gon' go
I'm a hop off in this clean ass triple silver Porsche Turbo and hit the road and Go
You run a nigga blood pressure up from that spite shit
And normally I don't fuck with that type bitch
But she got a nigga feeling her though
Text messaging my phone I feel like killing this ho
But before I let her get on my row
I'm a hand the bitch her walking papers letting her go and hit the doe
But yo, I ain't never seen a UFO
And I ain't never seen a ho that's more important that dough
So go

Now where do I go
I'm rolling late night with my buzz on
Leaving out a strip club and wanting my fuck on
I'm strolling through a list of my missed calls
And right up out the blue man this bitch calls
You coming over here (woman's voice)
I'm like shit naw
So to question that decision she eats up a dick raw
But man, I'd rather go to bed with a hard dick
Than to have to spend the whole night of fucking and arguing
This bitch a lunatic, fuck a nigga high off
I wish it was I way I could hit and just drive off
But that's not happening
So I'm a lay my ass down, watching girl's gone wild penis in my hand now
Hardest times and I don't wanna sell out
Still I'm putting on my flip-flops to bail out
I grab my keys off the table my coat
It's an open invitation for a nigga to score, so I go!

All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I've given all of me so unselfishly

Now where do I goEmbed
I am ghetto, boy, chillin'
Represent for the niggas in the hood and how they livin'
Heavy metal concealin'
Hustlin' 'til you touch a 9 to 5 of drug dealin'
It don't matter how I get it, I got it, fuck feelings
I don't have none, I'm 'bout my paper, nigga, ask 'em
Don't get confused on how the cash come
Never, by any means necessary better
Get up off your ass and get my money 'fore I stretch yah
Out in front your doorstep, when I brandish this .45th
You can make arrangements, you a dead man, a ghost
See I come from them cuts for real
Much long before this rap came, fuck the deal
I survived the game of life, nigga, fuck some skills
Crossin' me, get in the way, this pussy must get killed
I'm alive, he came, he bust 'til he left
I would have made for sure I was dead and fuck yourself
Yeah, cause now I'm at his ass with a vengeance
Blood in, blood out from the beginning to the ending
Real shit bein' spit, know your limits
It's best you mind your mothafuckin' business
If you ain't in it

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin', no, eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the dirt

Dope sold on the cut make our hands bleed
Fuck broke it ain't an option, penitentiary
Or the grave is the only way we fall back
Do our time A.T.W then crawl back
To them streets where we come from taught life
Look alive know niggas better walk right
Real with it quick trigger finger gun play
I only know how to deal with these niggas one way
And someday I swear to God I'mma change that
But I can't cause them evil demons came back
And when I'm high y'all I can't explain
What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
Cause mane I've been a loyal dude and you can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need to talk but there ain't no one to listen
Lost inside a mental exorcism
And wishing

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

I woke up from a dream feeling all good
Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing
Lost, stuck in a stand still waiting for a hand out
Hustling for tennis shoe paper never panned out
My sister tripping got my grandmother stressing
Cause shes only 17 and shes already pregnant
Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
Bg's is tripping ain't nothing left to stop them
Uncle in jail daddy dead and their mamma's
Can't teach them how to be men; grow up being followers
The streets swallow them then life overpower them
Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
Crash tested a dummy high volume
Only God can judge but y'all niggas is comical
90 percent of our future's off in prison
Prescription for my mental exorcism
And listen

Plus he knowing how that evil be, but who am I
To judge a man when I see him try
FOX news tried to justify him
And ain't no way that you can clarify
In cold blood our lil homies dying
Another sign of the times but it's terrifying
That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk
Get arrested go to jail go to court and get the fuck off
That shit is fucked off we worried about the money lost
While the clans about to light another cross
I ain't denying it I speak from intuition
It's also from my mental exorcism

You win some, you lose some, life in a nutshell
Free all my niggas on locked down, fuck jail
I've seen enough hell to never wanna live there
Tattooed teardrops, sitting in a wheelchair
Kids on the streets doing bad, momma moved out
Dopeman pushing on the corner where the schoolhouse sits
This is bullshit, this can't be life
I can't blame it on the hood 'cuz it gave me  life
This a stick-up, don't turn it to a 187
I don't go to church so I'm far from a Reverend
Ain't nothing like a young nigga, armed with an AK
Walking up the sidewalk, shooting in the broad day
Fuck what a broad say, I'm all day villain
I'm getting money so I'm always chilling
And even though they say I'm killing all they children
I'm just a nigga hustling for my million dollars

Immature ass niggas get you sentenced to death
Loud talking in the tank like he a stone cold killer
And you fighting a murder charge, my nigga?
The moral of the story is keeping your mouth shut
'Cause everybody is listening, speaking you fucked up
I tell you like them old cats say: get what you get and get your ass out the way

This for my people in the game ten toes, rooted in the streets, and withholding info
We got secrets we gon' take to the grave
We don't honor nothing else, except the rules of getting paid
And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope
Everything we doing legal eagle leaving us broke
What I hope is that a nigga don't forget where he from
And turn his back on his hood cause he's seeing some crumbs
And no money in the world that's enough to respect, when somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest
Saying 'fuck it' at the same time he squeezing a round
You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down
If it was me, I'd be leery of the people I meet, cuz in this motherfucking game niggas playing for keeps

Sunday morning I'm off at church
Sinnin' throughout the week, hustlin' every day
Gettin' it as we speak, listen to preacher preach
Choir singing the song, annie clapping her hands
Momma singing along, I'm impatient I wanna leave
Can't let my Momma see, I ain't listening to the word
Not like I don't believe, but I'm trippin' nobody perfect
To speak it wouldn't worth it for a person to be so Christ like
But I swear, I heard him cursin'
Let him without no sins cast the first stone
But I am so not him so let me go on on
Get home and he will find his hat on
Who's family when this all went on
Come on, let's see, some laughs, then we
Can do the same damn thing again next week
I love it when It happens like that
I smile because it's not all bad

You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water

The penitentiary is where were headed
Designed for downfalls and some still don't get it
And yeah I might have said it way back and got sweated by
The same ones admitting it now but no credit came to me
If you can see the things I see
Then you could point your fingers at the blame not me
Ashamed how we can't stand one another
We hate the idea of a unified young brother so we suffer
But I adapt cause I'm a hustler
I still stay strapped with the muffler
I'm ten toes trapped in the struggle cause
I'm what the hood made mothafucka what

As solid these niggas come, realist they ever made
Money is not important it's livin' it how you say
Picture back in the day, me moving a brick a week
Murdered you if I had to nigga I'm from the streets
And out here were playing for keeps, speak and your getting froze
Neck gettin' wrapped in sheets, sneakers will be exposed
This bullet here for your soul
Bitches is just for sex, that said I could jack my dick
She don't deserve respect, I'm knowin' my niggas feel it
Nothin' is fabricated authentic as I can say it
The only way I play it, this is for Curtis Davis
Mothers of fallen soldiers, Children of murdered fathers
Fathers out on the corners
Corners I'm standing on and I love 'em without a reason
Chillin' or either bleedin', they made me I'm never leavin'
Though the looks can be deceiving
Believe me y'all, it might sound sad
But trust me dog it's not all bad

Just waking up I gotta thank god
Fired up a square, that's how my day starts
Early mornin' buzzin' got me lookin' at life
Outside I see movin' bitches look at the lights
It's just another Saturday it seems like
Got dressed and hit the corner with my team right
Smoke it, roll it up and pass it around
Now I'm stoned and my ass is barely draggin' the ground
No sooner than you think I would've thought of
A cop walks over, never saw him
"Excuse me, mister officer man, I wasn't tryna disrespect"
And started coughin' again
Eyes red as a bandana
And one time heavy on his antenna
At his request they sent a squad car
And then they put my black ass behind bars

Oh, sittin' on this concrete couch, just waitin'
For the judge to say that I'm gon' be free today
Oh, sittin' in this concrete box, just sayin'
It's been a shitty day, can't find no other words to say
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fingerprinted and gettin' booked in
They fed a nigga , so I took ten
Cause I'm knowing that I'll be sittin' here the whole night
Empty trunk tank, it's finna be a cold flight
I finally come up on some housin'
Old celly, so I'm bettin' me a thousand
And plus I got a bottom bunk pass
Boss came in with his punk ass
Talkin' to a nigga like it's date time
Askin' where I'm from, I'm from H-town
Niggas askin' me what I'm in for
Nosy motherfuckers want some info
I tell him, "Dog, I ain't done shit
You know these redneck crackers think they run shit."
It's lights out, I tie my mat down
Chuck it on the rack and stretch my ass out

It's court call in the halls
Strip a nigga down to his balls
Bare-butt, naked in my tennis shoes
The nighttime sergeant want an interview
They push us out like livestock
"Ain't no talkin' while I'm talkin', this is my block"
I finally get to see me a judge
I'm a black man, so she got a grudge
Old bitch full of race hate
And a nigga quick to represent the gray state
I ain't got a lawyer, I don't need one
Give me thirty days, you get three one
I ain't tryna piss in a jug, bitch
Just because I'm black, I get fucked with
Babe, if I had been a white dude
I'd have never been arrested, look at Michael
And even if I swam like a fish, though
They still would've threw me in the Crisco
And fried a nigga's ass in some hot grease
I'm just tryna get my ass out the hot seatEmbed
If this is love I don't see it
Can't make me believe it
You a nice girl, but I'm a hood nigga on some street shit
And yeah, you know my weakness
Sucker for some love type
I come from the slums girl, you come from a good life
I wonder what you see in me
I love weed and Hennessy
You barely doing happy hour, I ain't never seen you drink
And now that's leaving me to think, how I got so close to you?
This was just a hit and split, that's what I supposed to do
One thing let up to the next, I'm addicted to your sex
You addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect
That's what I get I guess, I can't commit that's killing this
You gave me an ultimatum, I'm numb I ain't feeling shit
Must not know who she dealing with
Puddles on her pillow case, tears running, eyeline, lipstick smeared
Hey are you ok?
You disobey, you pay for that
Well, the love is gone, and she ain't made it back, pray for that

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'

Look, you want me here or not?

Think before you answer that, it's hard enough we breaking up
But after this no turning back, brought this on myself with her
Mistakes I'm forced to live with that, I'm knowing more mistakes to come
I'm human, that's my best excuse, in fact my only one
Tears fall, my kids call, 'This ain't me, it's his fault'
Oh shit no, we did this
A partnership with no room for forgiveness
I take the blame, take your aim
Shoot that shot, can't wait to claim
All of this, in Jesus name
Pray in church, they give you change
I feel your pain
Songs sung in the key of life, with no meaning right
Hopefully one day might come I'd see the light
Can't sleep at night
And I'm wondering who's fooling who?
I'm sure you know who's fucking me, cause I know who's been fucking you
We used to be inseparable, never thought that that day would come
Where I'd take that shit so serious, and you get so good at playing dumb, you got away with one
What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do

You had me I'll admit that, fell into the trap you set
Lookin' me in my eyes, lyin', killing me with that soaking wet
Wouldn't let me meet your connect
Scratching me all across my face
Says she loves the way it feels when I'm in it all the way
60 calls a day, wondering where the fuck I'm at
Wondering where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that
Now let's be honest, you got him with whom you made your promise
And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered, enjoying moments after
Plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives, are husbands reckless why?
Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry?
Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line
Better step aside, gotta tell me why?
I was everything, you was all I had
Now this is change, and then this change is bad
Make a note of that
What happened to us, you acting foolish

I couldn't agree with you more
Jealous hearted motherfucker
Never been able to fuck with me nigga, ever
Super solid from day one
Never put myself in a compromised position, I'm a chess player
And if I did... I'd just shoot my way out

First born to my momma
I come from the place where you're promised
To die before your 21st
You'll be surprised what's underneath the earth
Dug dirt, I put bones there
All my enemies is gone now
I can't sleep through the cold sweats
Flashbacks, I'm a known threat
God fearing yet I'm evil though
I think deep, I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body?
Then you know why I took my gun and head-shot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
It's either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU!

Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

I live like I spit it
Raised by the wolves so my mentality is "get it"
A life on the streets takes commitment
The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches
A real nigga played the game like it's business
A weak nigga facing time, go to snitching
Plotting on his whole team 'cause he ain't wanna listen
If it was all good just a week ago
Take your motherfucking charge, that's your key of dope
We all wanna eat, gotta feed folks
Took an oath on the streets called a G code
That's what we live by, die for it
I got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have five-K-one's, gun killers
 bust that nigga, fuck that nigga!

They jealous of me cause I shine bright
My grind strong plus my mind right
My gun loaded up in both clips
Jump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth
No shit, this is music you can drive-by
G's the only code we abide by
Blunt burning in the ashtray
Playing faggot games and now your ass chafe
Niggas wearing tight pants and high heels
Claiming another nigga's hood that is not real
I am still the hardest nigga being heard
Fuck he claiming he real when he ain't keep his word?
He ain't fooling me, my nigga, he is just a nerd
Nothing but a rap tune, he ain't seen a bird, word
I talk that shit that I can back, though
Cause that's in my boxing game, I'm in the back, hoe
Talk that big six but pack a double blank
You where trouble ain't

I been there, done that, grew from my fuck ups
A hard head make a nigga soft ass tougher
My momma used to say that one day I'd suffer
If I ain't tighten up and get my shit right, trust her
I'm seventeen out here living the life
And I ain't never coming back home, you giving advice
To a nigga don't need it, I want my freedom
To hang on the corners running from the policemen
If I knew then what I know right now, I would have sat my stupid ass back down
I wouldn't listen
Cuz what she told me in the end came true
What you do to me your kids gon' do, times two
Forgive me momma I ain't mean no harm
But let her tell it, I ain't seen no storm. It's just beginning
But in a minute I'll be waving the flag cuz I don't think that I can take all that

Me and my mother are like sister and brother
She said "Son I've done things I'm ashamed of, but I had to do"
I've lived longer and secrets made me stronger
And you wonder how I already knew
It's cause I'm already you

I remember walking home from a party we had shut down fighting
They came from another neighorhood so we ain't liking it
The beatdown started from the inside, wiped them
From one side to the other side like Tyson
We heard gun shots and ran like lightning
Heart beat way too fast, I'm frightened
That's when I realized that niggas pack guns too
And not afraid to shoot a motherfucker if he had to
We was some young dudes, living life wreckless
Drinking MD, vandalizing shit, restless
We went from stealing hotshots getting sessted
To kick those burglaries, Warren got arrested
That's when them dip had us thinking we was bad man
When Eric B. said to "clap your hands''
I'm just imagining the shit I did
If what I've done is goin' affect my kids
Shit

And you wonder how I already knew
It's cuz I'm already you

I seen myself where my mom was
My mom like my grandmom, my kids like I am
Every day is like a standoff
Don't fuck up like I fucked up
You may not be as lucky, I'm a rare case
Coulda went the other way, trust me
Just do your best and I ain't mad if you miss it
You are gifted, it's up to you to make the best decision
Cause one day I'll be leaving this game and y'all have to carry on my name
OKEmbed
Miss me, wished me, well, I am done now
Won't be coming back again, I'll let you run wild
Smile for the camera, pose for a snapshot
This will be the last tape, I'm about to cash out
Fun while it lasted, maybe in the next life
I can be your girlfriend 'cause I don't need an ex-wife
They tellin' me that beauty's only skin deep
Inside empty, pissed off simply
'Cause I will not apologize for nothin' I done did wrong
Bitch, you done chose me, you are gonna win some
And lose some, that's just a couple thang
Fine if it works, if it don't, that's another ring
Sold to the highest bidder, my nigga
Ho had the nerve to tell her mama I hit her
Never had to, that is not true
Now I got a new boo thang, and that is not you, ooh

Let us fly to the heart
It's a fight for the love
Simple words weren't enough
I don't know, I don't know
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she goin', where she goin'?
It feels like I'm in hell
I don't know, I don't know

I can pack my own bags, no use tryna stop me
I got my mind made, a spade is a spade, ma
You took what we had and made it bad, what's to save now?
Relationship is gone, ain't no heart here
Just an ice box where it was, if it's not clear
Let me make it for you — we are over, find another
Ain't no use in tryna reason with this stupid motherfucker
I never shoulda trust us, you was dirty from the jumpstreet
You wanted a rap star, you ain't really want me
Settle for a anybody, shit you done was idiotic
You thought I was broke, huh? Bitch, I'm gettin' plenty money
That shit is really funny, you gave me the ten count
You threw in the towel on me, then brought that Benz out
You at your friend's house booed up with some dude
With pictures on your Instagram, smiling with him, fuck you

Let us fly to the heart
It's a fight for the love
Simple words weren't enough
I don't know, I don't know
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she goin', where she goin'?

I don't know, I don't know
Hey, it's a new me, I hope you found new you
And got your shit together, I ain't mad, baby, do you
There's plenty other dudes to fall in lust with
For holidays, or any other days you put your trust in
You're a must win, losing ain't an option
You don't wanna work
You want the finer things, stop this
You ain't no better than the next bitch beggin'
Can't pour piss out of them boots you put your legs in
And even want a fairytale wedding
Like a nigga wanna wife you, and I don't even like you
The love gone, how am I gon' write a love song?
I'm wishing you the best, but wouldn't fuck you with a glove on
Now girl gone, how nice of you to stop by
Bitch that you accused me of sleeping with is my wife now
Let me be nice now, here's you introduction
Mrs. Jordan, here's that stupid bitch that I was fuckin'

Let us fly to the heart
It's a fight for the love
Simple words weren't enough

Aww, yeah
Free at last, free at last
Thank the God Almighty, once again, I'm sucka free at last
Yo 'Face, I'm gonna take a little longer on this intro
So I can shine the spotlight on these roaches and rats
So let me say to you homies, there's a conspiracy to destroy all Black entrepenuaers, in hip hop, by rat niggas and law enforcement
So let me begin with rat number 1, in Houston, Bookman
Now this guy sued me, went on tv, to show off his pumpkin head and swollen eyes
And then the police filed assault on me, misdemeanor, offered me 6 months probation
I told them no, so they made it a felony, and told me it carries from 2 to 20
So the judge say "what are y'all offering Mr. Prince" and the DA, Badheart, who not even a prosecutor in the court room, but since he has his obsession with destroying me, he yells "10 years"
So I told my Lawyer, Ken Schafer, "You tell him to do it, or lets go to war"
So the war begun, and  the target number one was Bookman. And he told on everybody, Johnny binder, Harry Ole and even himself
I never saw a man sit and tell on himself, money fraud, tax evasion and then put the roach and the rat who is helping him, Binder and Harry Ole, in the grease
Now, I'm almost through, but the shit gets deeper
Because right about the time Bookman battleship is about to sink, and my case dismissed,  the DA Good-I mean-Bad Heart claims someone called his wife at home, and my name called on his caller ID
So I hired a man, investigator, got the number and it was a crooked phone, in my name
But a bogus address, and no other information
Now for y'all who know, I was born at night, but last night
So who knows who has access to DA's home and mobile number
Yo Face, there's a lot of racism in Harris County, DA office
That's out to destroy our black leaders
Yo Face, I smell a set up, from Schumaker
So drop some heat for my boy Roy Jones, who trains to your music
Earl, who stood like a soldier for my case
And Fred who told the truth
And to all my peeps who stood and rode with me from day 1
I'm still that nigga, raw with no cut
Yo face, you know the homie Little Pots is still doin 12 years behind this clown
So let's expose this snitch nigga, Lil Troy, paper work

Yeah, I'm from around the way, I slung about a ounce a day
I'm living proof you ain't got no excuse
If it was there, it ain't got shit to lose

We caught you slippin', we would get at you
With no respect, fuck a nigga set
We shot it up and murk his connects
What's yours is mine for a dollar sign
I blame the grind, I was outta line
I'm reminiscing on what niggas did
For big rewards, you took a bigger risk
They say what comes around it go around
And when you least expect, the shit be goin' down

Gotta get it how I live, that's how the streets raised me, oh

'Cause if I didn't, they was coming back to finish off yo' ass
You a walkin' dead and it's a fact
You slimy niggas play the game wrong
Get popped, can't do they time, so they sang songs

Real nigga in your presence
Money couldn't change me past or the present
Homie, I'm the essence, tote a Smith & Wesson
Eyes hella tiny, in the hood is where you find me
Out here with the grimey, bitches wanna come up
Niggas slangin' snow packs, nose runnin' from 'em
Let you get your mind right, money on that weed, though
Baby on them mollywhops, blinded by the weed smoke
We come from them streets, ho, I stay on that ign'ant ish
Ain't nothin' 'bout me weak, ho, always game to stomp a bitch
And stomp a bitch, and stomp a bitch, got super boxing game
So I prefer to punch a bitch, mission accomplished
Put me up against whatever, I am bustin' it
A nigga's born hustlin' and tusslin'
And strugglin' and musclin'

The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Verse 1
It's like I have been living a lie
It's beautiful huh the way I can keep it inside
I'm settled in somebody's dream
Seeing through one of his eyes
Pieces of somebody's mind
Pictures of thoughts in the frame
I stand alone in the dark now
Sad and crippled and shamed
I loaded my pistol and aimed
Cocked it quick and then bang
Woke up in sweat feeling the death
Creates an eclipse in the brain
Sometimes I think I'm insane
I hear the voice when I'm asleep
Whispers my name again and again
This is what's she's singing to me

She is speaking to me once again
Hands in my ear
But this isn't clear
I listen but nothings explained
This is a lie
A feeling inside
I still often drift when I drive
The tears they leave burns on my cheeks
Motionless mirrors with eyes staring me down
A view of a soul
The heart of a woman is cold
My conscious is weak
She making me weak
The only love I've ever known has left me alone
And I'm dying inside
The only thing left is my pride
The pain you hear in my rhyme
For happiness I'll never find
All in my mind

"The moment that is bound to shape the future..."

I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, they tellin' me to dead it
It said that the message I was bringing brought destruction
I put the pen to the pad and said "Fuck them"
Here's a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me from the jump; they'd rather see me slump
Face down, shot five or six times
With my kid and her mama in the cop car crying, and I'm dying
Stop lying, it's a black and white thang
Redneck ass judge would rather watch a nigga hang
Than indict what's white, not right, fuck a news feed
Black men got the same needs as the Jews need
Who me? I demand reparation
Fuck a cowboy, I'm a native robbed of my nation
I'm an African, Black man, fucked out my language
Got me praying to a white boy God, that's insane
And if you ask me, why they steadily harass me
I reply with that "These motherfuckas nasty"
And I'm a god yet they calling me a nigga
They scared of me, so they try to hide behind the trigger
Acting bad ass, fuck a honkey with a badge
I'm a nigga with an attitude, you can kiss my Black ass
Ain't no sense in niggas being diplomatic
Televise the revolution, let these motherfuckas have it
I'm calling up the homies, they said to come through
And I run with them niggas ain't scared to come shoot
Take an eye for an eye, take a tooth for tooth
Do unto others as them others would do onto you
And now they saying "Make America Great"
But what America hates kept America straight
And America safe, motherfuck that flag
My people are not free, we wanna touch that bag
So quick to try to copyright what came for free
Now they blaming me, and it's plain to see
That they mad at that, like I'm a magic act
Yeah, imagine that; motherfucka, I'm Black
Fuckin' vultures, super quick to steal one's culture
Trying to make it your own; caveman, go home
Over-tan, long nose, funny-looking ass Donald
Got his nerve disrespecting President Obama
If you don't want us around then let us leave
Pay the money you've been owing my peoples as they were set free
That 40 acres and a mule never came
And yet we're still outstanding—out standing in the rain
Just waiting, patient, pacing, and praying
For God to step up, and not ain't shit shaking
I was mistaken thinking scripture coulda helped us
Following the faith of our very own oppressors
No justice, just us
Look at how the aftermath of slavery today still affects us
Our kids educated by the enemy
And they don't know shit about their history
'Cause they ain't teaching that in school
Leave it up to them coons, and all that's cool
Let the bygones be bygone
And besides, we've been killing off our own
Shut the fuck up, you know what?
Uncle Tom, house nigga slaves need they motherfuckin' nuts cut

Just waking up, I gotta thank God
Fired up a square—that's how my day starts
Early mornin' buzzin' got me lookin' at life
Outside, I see movin' pictures, look at the lights
It's just another Saturday it seems like
Got dressed and hit the corner with my team, right
Smoke it, roll it up and pass it around
Now I'm stoned and my ass is barely draggin' the ground
No sooner than I think they woulda thought of
A cop walks over, never saw him
"Excuse me, mister officer man, I wasn't tryna disrespect"
And started coughin' again
Eyes red as a bandana
And one time heavy on his antenna
At his request they sent a squad car
And then they put my Black ass behind bars

Just wanna pack up my bags, and get out of this hole
Can't believe they treat me so bad
Can't believe they actin' so cold
I just wanna leave this room
I'm still sitting on this concrete couch

Askin' where I'm from, I'm from H-town
Niggas askin' me what I'm in for
Nosy motherfuckers want some info
I tell him, "Dog, I ain't done shit
You know these redneck crackers think they run shit"
It's lights out, I tie my mat down
Chuck it on the rack and stretch my ass out

Gonna pack up my bags, and get out of this hole
Can't believe they treat me so bad
Can't believe they actin' so cold
I just wanna leave this room
I'm still sitting on this concrete couch
Just waiting for the judge to say, that I'm gon' be free today, yeah
It's court call in the halls
Strip a nigga down to his balls
Bare-butt naked in my tennis shoes
The nighttime sergeant want an interview
They push us out like livestock
"Ain't no talkin' while I'm talkin', this is my block"
I finally get to see me a judge
I'm a Black man, so she got a grudge
Old bitch full of race hate
And a nigga quick to represent the gray state
I ain't got a lawyer, I don't need one
Give me thirty days, you get three-one
I ain't tryna piss in a jug, bitch
Just because I'm Black, I get fucked with
I bet if I had been a white dude
I'd have never been arrested, look at Michael
And even if I swam like a fish, though
They still would've threw me in the Crisco
And fried a nigga's ass in some hot grease
I'm just tryna get my ass out the hot seat

Just wanna pack up my bags, and get out of this hole
Can't believe they treat me so bad
Can't believe they actin' so cold
I just wanna leave this room
I'm still sitting on this concrete couch

Dope sold on the cut make our hands bleed
Fuck broke, it ain't an option, penitentiary
Or the grave is the only way we fall back
Do our time A.T.W then crawl back
To them streets where we come from, taught life
Look alive, little niggas better walk right
Real with it, quick trigger finger, gun play
I only know how to deal with these niggas one way
And someday I swear to God I'ma change that
But I can't 'cause them evil demons came back
And when I'm high y'all I can't explain
What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
'Cause mayne I've been a loyal dude, and you can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need to talk but there ain't no one to listen
Lost inside a mental exorcism, and wishing...

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast, living life against the grain
Just one time, I wanna clear my mind, the silence seems so loud
If I could, I would fly away and live my life beyond the gray clouds

I woke up from a dream feeling all good
Prayed for better days ahead but what was y'all doing?
Lost, stuck in a standstill waiting for a handout
Hustling for tennis shoe paper, never panned out
My sister trippin', got my grandmother stressing
'Cause she's only 17 and she's already pregnant
Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
B.G.'s is trippin', ain't nothing left to stop them
Uncle in jail, daddy dead and their mamas
Can't teach them how to be men; grow up being followers
The streets swallow them then life overpower them
Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
Crash tested, a dummy high volume
Only God can judge but y'all niggas is comical
90 percent of our future's off in prison

I'm just sayin', a relationship should be 100-100
It can't be 50-50, right?
Right
Oh, you gon' think about it?
Yes, I'm gon' think about it
Look, do you want me here or not?
Oh, shit

Think before you answer that, it's hard enough we breaking up
But after this, no turning back, brought this on myself, uh-huh
Mistakes, I'm forced to live with that, I'm knowing more mistakes to come
I'm human, that's my best excuse, in fact my only one
Tears fall, my kids call, 'This ain't me, it's his fault'
Ah shit nah, we did this
A partnership with no room for forgiveness
I take the blame, take your aim
Shoot that shot, can't wait to claim
All of this, in Jesus name
Pray at church that we can change
I feel your pain
Songs sung in the key of life, with no meaning, right?
Hopefully that one day come I see the light
Can't sleep at night
And I'm wondering who's fooling who?
I'm sure you know who's fucking me, 'cause I know who's been fucking you
We used to be inseparable, never thought that that day would come
Where I'd take that shit so serious, and you get so good at playing dumb
You got away with one

You had me I'll admit that, fell into the trap you set
Lookin' me in my eyes, lyin', killing me with that soaking wet
Willingly let me choke her neck, scratching me all across my face
Telling me that she loves the way it feels when I'm in it all the way
60 calls a day, wondering where the fuck I'm at
Asking me where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that
Now let's be honest, you got him with whom you made your promise
And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered, enjoy the moments after
And plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives, a husband's reckless wife
Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry?
Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line
Better step aside, gotta tell me why
I was everything, you was all I had
Now this is change, and then this change is bad
Make a note of thatEmbed

Dem older cats would chunk a nigga fronts
Would rock it up and smoke that shit in blunts
For tennis shoes, we was getting fools
We caught you slippin', we would get at you
With no respect, fuck a nigga set
We shot it up and murk his connects
What yours is mine for a dollar sign
I blame the grind, I was outta line
I'm reminiscing on what niggas did
For big rewards, you took a bigger risk
They say what comes around go around

You got the nerve to act like you don't know
When all the while you steady gettin' mo'
Just remember dude we watchin' you
I spared your life they day they shot at you
'Cause if I didn't, they was coming back to finish off yo' ass
You were walking dead, it's a fact
You slimy niggas play the game wrong

Real nigga in your presence
Money couldn't change me past or the present
Homie, I'm the essence, tote a Smith & Wesson
Eyes hella tiny, in the hood is where you find me
Out here with the grimey, bitches wanna come up
Niggas slangin' snow packs, nose running, I'ma
Let you get your mind right, homie on that weed though
Baby on them mollywhops, blinded by the weed smoke
We come from them streets, ho, I stay on that ign'ant shit
Ain't nothin' 'bout me weak, ho, always game to stomp a bitch
And stomp a bitch, and stomp a bitch
Got a super boxing game, so I prefer to punch a bitch
Mission accomplished
Put me up against whatever I am busting it
A nigga's born hustlin' and tusslin'
And strugglin' and musclin'
Just making you aware who you fucking withEmbed
She just left her dude, but I ain't tryna be a rebound
Yeah, see, I'm only here for the ends, she's tellin' me 'bout
How much she like a nigga, probably figured I was ballin'
But I'm more like them mid-class dudes you steady stalkin'
And callin', like we a couple, I had to check her
And let her know that's far as it goes, not disrespect her
Correct her, tell her we cool, don't make this over
'Cause you don't like the way that it feels when I ignore ya
See, I ain't tryna hear what you sayin'
You got your heart broke by that dude
I ain't that nigga you got to watch for
We only friends, yet it's kinda hard to trust her
She already tryin' to go postal and I ain't even touched her
Maybe my lack of interest here got her interested
She loves the attention, that's the type of bitch she is
You know the saying, homie, "Fuck it, she fine"
She gotta learn that hers ain't as important is mine
And with that thought in my mind, I had to show where I stood
I seen her naked, testing a nigga, knowing it's good
But before I let her play me like the rest of these clowns
I'd rather get the fuck on 'cause I ain't 'bout to be a rebound

If you need me, just call me, we'll take it slow
Maybe it's meant, we'll never know
Not trying to play no games, I'm sick of all these lames
I'm not tryna tie you down
I'm not looking for a rebound
You might also like
I wasn't bullshittin', I ain't about to be her rebound
And if she didn't see it back then, I bet she see now
I moved on, just like she did when I first tried
Told me she just wanted a friend so I obliged
And now she wantin' pity, this ain't Sex and the City
Or the backup plan, you on the outs wit' ya man
And looking for a stand-in, but I ain't finna be it
But I could break your back in if you can keep a secret
I know she feelin' leapish, but I ain't finna jump her
And even if she the best in the bed, I'ma dump her
'Cause just as much as I love her, I hate her with that same heart
She played with a nigga, and that part of it ain't smart
Beautiful girl, yeah, she triflin', though
She go dude after dude after dude she go
And when it don't work, she callin' me to talk about it
Like I'm 'posed to give a shit, I got my own fuckin' problems
Got passed around like a basketball
She went from player to player like her ass was all that
And now she's heartbroke, sad, and down
I'ma pass on dinner, we'll catch another rebound

If you need me, just call me, we'll take it slow
Maybe it's meant, we'll never know
Not trying to play no games, I'm sick of all these lames
I'm not tryna tie you down
I'm not looking for a rebound
I'd rather stay your friend 'cause I refuse to be a rebound
Of course I coulda played with your feelings, but that would be foul
But think about it—you know too many of my exes
And I know all about yours, I listened to the messages
That would be reckless if I gave you the chance
Knowing your history with niggas, they can only be friends
I'm the same way with women, girl, you know me, we kin
Not by blood but type of relationships we've been
In and out of; it was lust, not love
'Cause if it was, thoughts of us would have not popped up
Plus, I know you're lonely trying to fill that void
But you can kill that noise 'cause we are null and void
You need some time to yourself so you can sort shit out
Think about what you're doing 'fore you get back out
'Cause you looking for love in all the wrong faces
And you judging it on a bank account basis
But let's face it: you're not a little girl, you grown
You need to try to find a love of your own
As far as now, you walking on some dangerous ground
As fucked up as it sounds, you gotta catch me on my rebound

If you need me, just call me, we'll take it slow
Maybe it's meant, we'll never know
Not trying to play no games, I'm sick of all these lames
I'm not tryna tie you down

Where I'm from killers go dumb
Usually death is the outcome
Welcome to the jungle, where kidnappers haunt you
The streets, they really want you
I'm serious, no smile on this block, gives answers if you curious
Good times disappear quickly back into a mist
Shooter hardly ever miss, that means I'm accurate
Crack the pitch man, pretty soon I'mma have to switch
Scratchin' the itch with paper cuts on my index
The real riders shoot up blocks and screams who next
Like my nigga "Two-Tecs", he tote two tecs
Done been in beef before but in Houston they call it plex
Gotta know the protocol, I'm warnin' y'all it gets deep
So deep, the prison guards'll put you to sleep
Rest eternally, no comin' back ya O.D., overdose
This neighborhood got me comatose
Back against the wall, another statistic I know

The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail
I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail
And if I get busted I'm not about to tell
Cause I'm a gangsta

If this was goin' on in your neighborhood what would you say?
Given the opportunity to tell it to the masses
Lower middle class still a carryin' bus passes
Young girls givin' birth before they hit the ninth grade
'Bout to be a mom and can't even make Kool Aid
Who made this crack anyway? Told us about the heroin
Sold us alcohol and the guns that we carry 'round
Can't blame us for everything goin' wrong in the States
I don't blame a nigga for nothin' he do to get cake

It's like the ghetto's got a heart and a soul, a mind of it's own
A hunger for a young cat to die 'fore he grown
A lust for a young girl to slide down a pole
She's always fallin' short on her goals
The street life is cold, it's either win or lose or you fold
Money is the root to all evils what I was told
When everything you thought you'd believed in was a hoax
You put your faith in front of those demons
And when the smoke clears, the truth appear
The fight for your life, the struggles of a wrong versus right
And wrong won, a song sung in the keys of reality
When death crosses your path, blood shed tragically
So automatically you come to a close and realize
That no matter what we key to the codes
I seen the hood swallow muthafuckas whole
Then shit 'em out in the system ain't never make it home, that I know

Tear that motherfucker down I just want your draws
That's why I'm laughing everytime you call
'cause I know that you're in love with how I broke it off
The nigga strokes too soft and she a beast in bed
And when she fucks she talks pussy is deep and wet
And I don't need the taxes I don't sweat the bitch
And sworn and damn and that's some texas shit
And I won't fuck's em on the first day, I peeps they mind
So they know that what they havin more important than mine

In the end is something both is something seasons out
And even if we are just friends that don't justify
You being seeing with a boy like him
'cause boy that's bad and they know before it's over
You be bend over my sofa while I bust that ass
And while that nigga takin' pictures of you behind your clothes
Sendin' roses to your office while he's crying and soars

Opened up my door and asked the bitch, "What's up?"
Lookin' at me crazy, I'm like, "Bitch, what's up?"
She asked about my woman, I said "My woman at home"
I asked about her nigga, she said her nigga was gone

Gave her some game and now I got that bitch

Greatest ever done it, you can learn from it
Dope game; ran it - rap game; run it
Street cred hundred, nerd turned D-boy
Naughty genetic make-up, baby, I'm a G-boy
Hashtag street-boy, wrong one to fuck with
Cross me at your own risk, play to get back, you can trust this
I am far from average, to me it ain't no such thing
Me against the world so fuck it I let my nuts hang
I've been known to bust bang, Kíli of the NEB
I don't need an army when the smoke clears, he sees me
Rhyming at its finest unlike those vaginas
They claim that they the real deal knowing I'm the highest
Time for the command chain, I am what the streets made
I am what the hood built, you are just a weakling
Homocidal maniac with suicidal tendencies
You're more like a punk band, I'm more like a pedigree
Nigga, you ain't seen yet so y'all can not describe me
I'm a freak of nature, Don't shit here suprise me
Money over everything except a nigga's manhood
I am not a prostitute, you don't understand hood
Fuck a nigga getting his unless he 'bout to give me mine
Otherwise he prime beef, shocking when I up the nine
And hit him with it several times, fuck you thought I was civilized?
Welcome to the jungle, fool, it's only right I punish you
Nigga with an attitude, feel like MC Ren felt
Quiet on the set, you funky bitch, you get your friend slept
I'll give your gang a black eye, blame it on the black God
I be on some nigga shit, I'm nigga rich so that's why
Guess what my religion is, this is what the business is
Expose you for your garbage ass rappers, you can witness this
Came to bang the game up, pussies think they came up
Oh, you got a drophead? So now you think you're famous?
Out here it's dangerous, if we don't know your name cuz
We don't even give a fuck, rappers get it fucked up
Security save you? Nah, it's their side job
They don't want no conflict, they don't want no problem

Nigga, dirty money

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Dirty, fo sho
It's your downfall

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hopeless again, and the more I stick around the shit get more fucked up
That's why I'm back on Holloway gettin' fucked up
Thinkin' back on how it used to be when it was all good
We wasn't trippin', this was our hood
I had your motherfuckin back
And when it was time to go to war, it was like "where these niggas at?"
Fuck rackets, we ain't never been the type to hold out
Or, let a motherfucker show out
No doubt, we put it down for the 9-0-triple 4
Droppin tops, fuckin fine hoes
These other niggas is finally catching up
Listening to rappers ballin and gettin touched
Wasup? You done forgot about the street rules, splurgin
Is you a motherfucking fool?
Money ain't a thing to a nigga out here rappin
But to a nigga out there cappin?
That's they downfall

Now the whole neighborhood silent
Got the fed-e-rals hangin (Shhhh)
While these young niggas steady sangin
I need a motherfuckin law-uh-yer (Why's that?)
I'm in a state of paranoia
How many niggas in the six-by-six
Fin' to get, some time behind some loud mouth bitch
Fin' to snitch, trapping niggas up in they downfalls
Taping motherfuckers phone calls
Ay, I've been in this shit for two deep
From moving ki's, pushing weight was too sweet
An 8-ball will cost you 75 (Dirt cheap)
Back in the game that shit was live
And all you had to do to survive was get a whole click
Of niggas, down with they business and stack chips
Savin up for hard times
Do the time when you do the crime
You niggas tryin to ? your downfall
(Chorus)
(Voice with effects)
Nothing lasts forever but love
Money comes and goes
But for those ?? it surely goes

You rollin over in the joint, trying to get your time dropped
Puttin niggas up forever, cause you did the crime hop
Turned fed, and know they got indictments for real
Runnin in niggas houses, niggas fighting appeals
Offering 50 years to innocent motherfuckers
All because of the game, niggas run outta hustle
Feds be showin pictures, you got to give 'em somethin
Time make a nigga forget it and start bumping
And saying shit, jeopardizing the whole thang
Niggas run out of freedom, niggas start to sang (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah)
Laughing in your face, chuckle and produce
Avoid they conversation, them niggas the dudes, fool


Thing is, when a motherfucker is doing dirt
Don't come moving it, ya know what I mean
Ya know, that won't get you no Rolls Royces and shit like mine baby
Your money dirty, wash your shit
Them motherfuckers out here, yeah
"dirty money" *scratched to end*Embed
Is this how you made it, or is this sickness out of control
Is the beginning
Of the end right now? Let me know
Do the saved souls travel the road of the
Souls lost?
How come the dead can't talk?
Through horrified eyes I can picture the other side
And though my heart shed tears outside I couldn't cry
Watched my homeboy die, day by day body tired
Remember, I finally accounted before he expired
They tell me there's a peaceful place, I wanna see it
They say I gotta leave it to see it, so it be it
And though I appreciate bein alive
Sometimes I wanna see how it feels to just die
Come back and tell my story to the ones who really know me
Converse with the angels and elders that went before me
And satisfy the hunger for those who wanna know
If there's life after death, and if so, where we go
I often find myself involved in deep thought
I wanna see is heavens a place like we thought
And Christian science seems to think it's just a mindstate
But before I put my trust in a man I'll just wait
Or better yet, I take the journey for myself
Put a bullet in my own head, it's my death
So when twelve o'clock jump on eve of 11/9
( *gunshot* ) suicide
Just as I thought, a bright light
Greeted by friends and family, so life-like
Black and in between screams and then peace
Lookin in the eyes of the grieved and deceased
Father pleace, send me back, I don't wanna die
I'm not as strong as I was and I can't lie
And during all the mayhem somehow I remained calm
And I woke up singing this song
You might also like
I been a pawn and I been a king
And I been down since the beckoning
I try to look beyond the sight of sound
And the lights come from the underground
Rarely got questions but I found myself somewhat astound
And through my quest for the answers, know what I found?
I found that regardless to what people say
The shooters gotta do it day for day
So make your peace

Open your books to the first chapter, verse four, page eight
And link to my thoughts as my intents are to initiate
And enter the minds of the ones who are blind
And shed light to all the mankind written in rhyme
I preach to each to get off your ass, stand on your feet
Cause everyday it's niggas lyin dead in the street
We stuck in our ways, it's different now than back in the days
Fuck what they say, cause ain't no comin back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talkin about
I had a dream and seen a double sun, a different world was in the makin
The ruler of this new world was Satan
The sky turned blood-red, the silent trumpet started playin
Then I woke up, my imagination
Runnin wild but then again the coming of Christ
Could be the moment of any minute, now or tonight
So make your peace, cause 666 is the mark of the beast
It's dark in these streets
And some might see it hard to believe but God is in me
And yea, though I walk through the valley of the wickedness
I know I'm protected cause I'm convicted
Anybody believin in the Big Bang Theory
And thinkin that thyself is the God, you need to hear me
How do you explain
The skies, the moon, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea
The Earth without form facing the deep
Darkness and challengin the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds
Didn't make up the trees, so why we turn our backs on the truth?
This heaven and hell part we seem to hide from the youth
I'm tellin what few tongues of the evil will despise
My intention's to revitalize, still I revive
And I've read the Books, and I heard the lessons
And I'm on my knees steady stressin
You make your peace

I don't really remember ... feelin' like this
- I wish they can see they need Mary

In a great day and I'm on it
Coming up out ya
And every now and then I can't help but to think about ya
Hatin' that we ended like this, but I had ya beefin'
I knew what that was missin wondering, and I need ya
More now then I ever did, put in my heart for ya
Starin' at my eyes they ain't shot, wide open
Gotta love forming in my life, for another day
And I thank you for some other doing, just let em' pray
(Scarface whispering)
-Just the only thing, I need Mary
-Sssssshh!, I just need Mary

Had me thinkin'
She was the only I'd ever needed
Stick in ground, runnin' round, like oh..never need her
I remember seeing cancer sticks, and smellin' inscents
The intimate, and couch, hoping it's soak sex
And niggas so thick, I had to call her up the same night
Dang, they said the number still is the same
Wouldn't let my friends kill her
Take ya penetentiary chances to be with her, go deep with her
Cheif with her, sprung on the number lawn braud
Once she get you hot in her clutches, you can't run
In the dark, hearing footsteps, and you can't sleep
You find yourself so in love with this bitch, that you can't eat
Paranoia, that's a feeling so scarce(so scarce)
This bitch almost made me need Mary

And I'm hoping you can accept my apology, for this one last time
You can tell that I ain't had her, cuz I can't control her
This hasheesh, Mary I love, just like I told ya
I'm sensitive as I write you this letter, so listen to it
Seeing if you'd be down for a threesome

That bitch ain't no good

Look at your face all frowned up
The only thing you got goin for ya is your fake tits and round butt
You're a rich nigga's worst mistake
You're just a trophy, and what make matters worse you're fake
A mall broad tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Whatever they wear in the videos, you want it
You tryin to find the nigga with the biggest contract
To get you pregnant, so you can ride around and get fat
And collect big money, with the baby all sharing
Got a 18-year career from child bearing
And only God knows what this kid'll go through
Got mixed feelings about his dad cause of you
The dollar signs popped up, that's what did it
And dude, he was just as fucked up cause he hit it
And now you out there buyin champagne for the club
To me that's kinda fucked up

Only your mother could love you
Much too freaky, you're easy
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I ain't never had to pay for mine
Only your mother could love you
Much too sneaky, you're freaky
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I wouldn't give a broke bitch a dime

You used to turn up your funky-ass nose before I even stepped up

Of fuckin you without a rubber, fillin your pussy with cream
But when I wake and see you again, it be the same old shit
I finally realized you just a plain old bitch
Started gettin my shit tight rockin shows every night
Gettin my dick sucked, fuckin hoes left and right
Workin hard to blow up, now you wanna show up
With your stretch mark titties and pussy lips all towed up
I heard you got married, that was it you thought
Until he kicked your ass and took back all the shit that he bought
Now you're lookin for a shoulder to lean on
Bitch, I sho' hate it, cause my shit is dis-located
You was the only one I was thinkin of
But now you got a face only your mother could love

Break it down

I can't do nothin for ya
Only your mother could love ya
I can't do nothin for ya

Look, Young Tela a pimp by force, not a pimp by choice
See, these bitches ain't playin when it come to the courts
They'll fold you like some foil when it comes to support
And you niggas out here trickin like nature takes its course
I'ma spit it till you're fitted, it's your main employ
See, I was trained and I was taught that a pimp keeps a choice
But you lames gotta change when you gave the whore a port'
One weekend at the Allstar and the bitch bought a Porsche?
I ain't mad, girl, flip em, you can get em, look we did it
Cause his mind was all twisted off the aether from the clinic
Now hit it, oh lawdy, look at shawty
Mission hit your boy for a four and a forty
Miss done get your Ford for a house - "Help me homie"
See, I can give a fuck about your loss cause you're phoney
You'se a lame and she seen it in your heart from the start
Why she ripped yo ass apart? It was lying in her cards
But eh, she'll only come up with another, I don't trust her
But she got one hell of a hustle
You black-hearted bitch, you are full of lies
So like go on and suck Young Tela and die

I'm gonna expose yo ass you bitch...
See me in these motherfuckin' streets (don't stop), with ya fag ass
Gangsta Walk, yeah right, ya pussy...

Look out, we everyday grinding
Everybody in the North gotta love us down South cause we blindin'
And we don't trip the big diamonds
We mainly focus on the old schools with big blocks lying
And I been around the world in one day
Chucking up the duece for S.A
I'm a hood cat, and that's for searching me a hood rat
With good cat, something beautiful to look at, fa sho
I kick it for my niggas in the ghetto
And all my homies in the federal-
Lock up, behind the wall setting shop up
They beat the block up, yet and still they couldn't stop us
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta back at it
Cause I'm the last of the Dons, God damm it
I hear ya talking, but I don't cater to the chit-chat
But when I see you in the streets I got ya get back (word)
It ain't enough protection on ya ass, to fuck wit Brad
I got a lesson for ya ass
I showed ya, the Southside niggas tote heat
I showed ya, the Northside niggas roll deep
Ya weak, cause I'm the biggest fish in the pond
And when I say the magic word, bitch ya gone
Assassinated, people lay steppin'
Eliminated, enemy with aggression
Sit back and smoke me one
The Obi Won Kenobi one
Fuck the champagne sippin', woodgrain grippin'
I'm spittin' for the Vice Lords, gangstas and Crips and Bloods
And everybody neighborhood
From the Idery Wells, back down to Inglewood
How can a nigga from the South get a pass in every section
And walk the projects with no protection
Be surrounded by a mob, and not get robbed
Considered to be a savior, and not be God (Whoa)
Listen to the nigga flow now
I can speed it up or slow down
Face the facts baby, I got it locked like this and like that baby
Southern rap/rock baby
The last of a dying, we born again
The vicous life religous, I was born to win
The closoure after the greatest hit the sofa
When I still ride for Prince like a soldier
The two-thousand millenium comes
Since I'm the son of the father, that makes me the Don
The next up to bat, the Jordan, larry, cousy yo of rap
And I ain't gotta walk around strapped
J don't tollorate the mack dirties
You in our motherfucking way, we tryin' to stack 30s
Now back it up, for he send something back to you
Ain't plan to defend
Staying loyal to the Prince to the end, so recognize

Dropped out in the 10th grade and told my mom to fuck school!
Cause they ain't teach a nigga shit, I learned to read when I was 5
And plus I been smart a long time
Fuck a history test, I'm more concerned about respect
I make my moves in an L like a knight nigga check
It's on 'til the break of dawn, I keep it on
And on and on, and on and on and on and on
Like clockwork, we hit these niggas where it hurt
Knock they dicks in the dirt
Now you the bitch that's in the skirt
I'm passed the motherfucka out here paying his dues
Not the average nigga out here rapping claiming he true
I just stick to the script and take it in stride
Get my daily dose of game from James and take it and ride
Yes yes y'all, funky fresh and in the flesh y'all
This time I'm aiming at the neck dog
It ain't no ducking when I'm bustin', I'm a leave you a nice-
Little whole in ya throat, releavin' ya life
I'm going out with a bang, letting my nuts hang

Fears weightless, I fear none in the physical form
Let us face, nigga, you can't do me no harm
Up here shakin, wishin me well, but deep in you heart
You wantin me close to make sure I dont ease in the dark
And squeeze wit thought, and leave you with the hole in your head
For wantin me dead, but I come to watch you suffer instead
Like burnin your bed, cuz I dont want your blood on my hands
That's not in my plan, to unstrap it and murda ya man, I murda ya man
And I go home and got your blood on my clothes, and I'll be guilty
But werent you the one who stepped on my toes, So I ain't guilty
At least thats how I see it inside, an eye for an eye
He challenge me and he gotta die, so I send him a kite
To let him know that wasn't right, and he in my sight
And I can't let him leave in the night, and he seein his life
Flashin right in front of his face, for fuckin wit face
This what you get for fuckin wit face

Open your eyes, cuz seein is believin my nigga
And stop breathin and now your ass is leavin my nigga
Protectin your chest, believin you put life in this bitch

Of tryin to be a better me, trouble was all I could seem to see
And the facts that I know tomorrow ain't promised to be
So from this day forth, Ima be all that I can be
When my cousin turned his back on me, I had to be my own man
Regardless of what the stakes was, Ima play my own hand
And im tired of bein let down be my so called friends
And regardless of the bloodshedin, ain't no tears in the end
Father please forgive me for im sinnin, forgive us all
But I ain't to blame, the lunatics were in my heart
And I think I need to build another wall
Cuz I dont want the world to see me
Cuz lately these niggas been tryin ta eat me
I'm exhausted and my body sleepy, But at lest its hard to rest
I'm a nervous wreck, I walk with stress
I used to walk around with a tech, but nowadays I be like fuck it dawg
You fuck wit me I gots to fuck wit yall
And revenge is just another word for payback
Payin you back today for this grudge that I had for you way back
You niggas knew I wouldn't play that
I sent you bitches to the morgue with two holes in your head, no remorse
Why you think my niggas call me the boss
Cuz I be dressed up in designer suits
And for the fact that these niggas know that im the truth
And I always look a man in his eyes before I shoot
And when he disrespect this man of respect, there ain't no excuse
I call on the troops, and put them dead on your case
For fuckin wit face, this what you get for fuckin wit face

This nigga tried to hit me yo, but he killed one of my people tho
So now I got to get this ho, they say revenge is expensive so I
Chartered a plane and I hit the coast, when I ran across this kid I know
We spoke briefly but we spoke in code
Tryin deeply to destroy his soul
I keep it real cuz the streets is watchin me
??? cuz the beats is jockin me
And all in all it was a smooth ride
Except for when this dude tried to hand me this conspiracy
See, I pimp the game like its a prostitute
And I won't stop until I clock the loot
Misunderstand me and I cock and shoot
Plus, I done learned what to do and what not to do

I'm just another ghetto boy
Single parent upbringing, mama's pride and joy
Dad died 'fore I got a chance to meet that dude
So I was raised in the hood, in the streets I grew
Seen it all, it ain't too much I ain't done yet
Let my nuts hang, nigga I ain't scared of shit
Seen death in my eyes, musta not have been time
Cause I'm the last of this motherfuckin breed of mine
Yeah and can't nobody tell you no different
The nerve of this motherfucker sayin I'm tripping
The nerve of you motherfuckers questionin this
When I'm as real as a realass nigga can get
And I was raised with that G-code embedded in my blood
And I would rather die than tell on a nigga from my hood
Or tell it on a motherfucker period
I take the code to the game that serious
The streets got rules, it's certain shit you don't do like
Sayin it was me when you knowin that it was you
It's not defamation if what I'm sayin is true
Picked a fight, got beat, now this pussy is tryin to sue
Bitch, you knowin what the outcome was
Fuck with one fuck with all, we were bound by blood
Not the blood of the gang but the blood of James
It's out of love for this nigga we pump slugs in frames
That's the type of dude you're listenin to
Soft to you for a minute then I'm trippin with you
And since you want it with me I'll position them goons
They carry out the order to this mission and boom
Ya out, now what was all this chit-chat about?
A word from the wise, keep my dick out ya mouth
Apparently I been too lenient on dudes
Cause you niggas done forgot who the streets belong to
I'm the motherfuckin king, I'm the motherfuckin mayor
I'm the president, the don, the boss of all players
Remember me, the one you got your idea from?
Well I'm still here, planted on this block I slung
So fresh and so clean, complicated rhyme schemes
You niggas is monotone, ain't no fuckin with heat
I'm a motherfuckin g and if I'm lyin then poof
May the Lord strike me dead in this motherfuckin booth
I'm the truth, emeritus, the F-A-C
The M to the O to the motherfuckin B
OG, to the critics analyzing my shit
Thinkin so-and-so is better, you can suck my dick
Cause it's been 20 years and counting and I still ain't bouncing
Fuck the club I'm a true thug, the realest nigga out here
Yeah I listen to them bullshit caps
Or how they so-called shine but that bullshit's wack
Steady on my grind and when I pull this strap
I'mma show you what I mean by "These fools just rap"
Cause I'm just as greedy as the next man is
I see em sellin and then I'mma feed my kids
And it is what it is, you can take it how you want it
Motherfuck who I offend they can meet me on the corner
It don't matter who you is or where you come from punk
When you see me that's the motherfuckin bell, bitch, jump
Cause I'm tired of you niggas disrespecting the great
I am legend, it ain't nobody fuckin with Face

CNN on my TV, bombs in the skies
Over Baghdad they fight but they don't know why
What they said about Hussein, was a God damn lie
Raised a war against a religion for oil, don't lie
I seen, kids from the hood livin like they gon' die
With the mindset of be broke or let's go get high
With the people livin so crazy how we gon' get by
Gasoline five dollars, how the fuck we gon' drive?
Can't afford to fill our prescriptions so we all gon' die
CVS is slangin dope on every block worldwide
Since Pfizer been had the dope game on fire
Then it's only right for one nigga to go get mine huh
If they injured how they gon' survive?
If they stuck at the bottom how the fuck they gon' ride?

I made it over to dry land
But still wound up sinkin in quicksand

Ain't life a muh'fucker, first you think you got it, then it
All falls apart in front your eyes, try to stop it, but it's
Part of the plan that was written by the man
Got me down on my knees and my hands, prayin
Forgive me Lord, thank the Lord I'm alive
Cause I'm knowin deep down I coulda died
I shed too many tears lost too many peers
In the grave or the penitentiary facin 20 years
Pourin beers on the corner, cause Frankie told me {?} lonely
I was high livin blind to the fact that they sold us out
America the Beautiful, there's a funeral
On every day of the month, tryin to get our knees up
Huh, it's another chance under these circumstances
My people ain't advancin, but if we pray
Maybe we'll get to live our lives in the sun
'stead of livin on the blocks dyin young, here I come4Embed
Clutching on steal triggers
Pouring kool-aid on hilfigers
For niggas I cut for
Pull a ho out my truck for
Take a bullet to my gut for
Shoot up your cuz for
And nigga you askin' me what for?
'cuz this check I wrote until death won't bounce
'cuz to quit is to care and excuses don't count
Yeah, the real nigga blues
Short sticks and long brooms
Two feet planted whether it be the tomb or the courtroom
Bullet wounds in my flesh
Powder burns I digest
On the front line I press
Until in peace I may rest
For battles I can't win
With stripes I must defend
Done been to the pen, behind friends
And I still can't turn my flags in
When you break weak I got to stand strong
I strive to go hard while you strive to go home
These checks I write are required day and night
For better or worse, ups and downs
Or just plain old fist fights
Packin' all the weight
Puttin' in work from birth
Running myself in the dirt
And you askin' me why my back hurt?
Even when your gal tried to give me some fish
I eighty-sixed that shit
Pulled your coat but you was scared to dismiss that bitch
But I guess you got to be one of me or walk in my shoes
Or drink from the cup that I drink to feel my blues
You might also likeYeah, the real nigga blues
I can't bend, brake, front, fraud, fold or get hacked
Its like I'm married to this game and my team looses if I get sacked
Turning down licks on niggas I know ain't got no heart
Arguing with my baby momma because shes convinces you'z a mark
My word is my bond, my life is my son
My duece is my gun, and my fear is to have none
'cuz I refuse to run
And for my honor I'd die, and for my mother I'd lie
My heart done got hard
I still show regards, call out to the Lord
But it seems like I can't cry
So when bullets fly...
Yeah, its my fault
Locked in with no way out
Fuck some clout, this is what I'm about
Even if I am the only one to get caught
It ain't in me to back down
Thats like laying my gat down
Nigga I ride for the cause, and I hide from the laws
And I ain't scared to get ragged on
And for my crown... yeah
Caps gonn peal
I ain't no threat, nigga but I will kill
And to all my partners up under them hills
Y'all know how it feels and thats real
Yeah, dig these blues
The real nigga blues
Dig this
My partners hit a lick for two and a half bricks
And since I'm the cornerstone of the clique
They came to me when the shit got thick
I took in all their evidence and made it mine
Not realizing that while they were ballin'
I'd be doing time
All they had to do was push the witness out of existence
And I would've walked because the case was inconsistent
But insted they got caught up in the joys
Of the fruit from the hussle
Said fuck me, let the witness live
And I got twenty five years
All 'cuz I kept it real
A mark would've squeeled
But insted I chilled, put it on the pill
But got ?chofferred in? a deal
See I respect the code of the streets
The code of the ?jeeks?
But when they gave it to me they said 'Fuck the police'
We'll never help these hoes solve a case
Now tears in my sons face
Because his daddy is out of place
With no trace of my peers
Missing my little nigga younger years
All because I kept it real
Regrets?
Sometimes have some
I'mma walk when me time come
It wasn't my prints on the gun
In yo' eyes, you'z a real nigga
So what you would've done?
Stand strong?
I'm not surprised
I was in the county camoflauging my cries
Squabbling niggas twice my size
For mistaking tears for fears in my eyes
But I ain't ask to be real
I was born like this
Sacrificing my fo' sho's for your maybes
Got me scorned like this
Tattered and torn like this
But my roots won't pluck
I'm the only reason your tooth won't buck
But is my authenticy worth the price I be paying?
All the shit I've been through
Nigga, do it look like I'm playing?
I'mma be down 'til I get laid down
All the ex-real niggas would've still be real
Only if they would've stayed down
But these my blues
I just spread the news to who I choose
A tale of a real nigga
Can you dig his blues?
Yeah, the real nigga blues
And all I got are my balls and my word
Yeah, my balls and my wordEmbed
Hey Joe, what's up baby?
Yeah, I like the beat
Hahaha...
Hey, when you drop drums I'mma drop rhymes, aight?
(Drop rhymes)
Nah, I don't need no count-off
Just drop the beat and I'm on it, aight?
(2-3-4)

I took my chances when I did my dirt
And my advice to any nigga if you crimin, you do it worse
Just get enough and step the fuck back
Cause in this game when you get fame
You gotta start dumpin these agents off your nutsack
I'm just a nigga out the hood tryin to have things
But when I got up on my feet you're screamin "Brad changed!"
And your excuse was that the money came
But my excuse was that you missed the plane, simple and plain
I got to show my homies love, though
I just don't fuck around with niggas that I don't know
And you can take that how you wanna take it
I'm from these muthafuckin streets
And the same rules apply in this game, don't ever break it
Ain't my muthafuckin luck I'm all alone at the crack
And you niggas don't wanna try to attack
We steady dyin over dumb shit, and me, I'm steady losin my sleep
Cause niggas ain't familiar with the rules of the streets
You're stuck
You might also likeStuck at a standstill

And to my niggas on the streets crimin (watch for haters)
Stop sittin on the sidelines and (get your paper)
Too many niggas complainin pointin fingers at the problems
"That's why I hate my baby mama"
I'm just a nigga from the very bottom
Skippin classes, goin 8 balls or the white powder
Tryin to get it while the muthafuckin gettin good
The possibilities of movin out my neighborhood
Don't get me wrong, I had them dreams too
But the only thing you do is get your cream, fool
Get your muthafuckin green, fool
Niggas ain't knowin 'bout the ins and the outs
First get in, then you get out
Don't be stuck at a standstill
(You know...
To the 2, ah 2-1
(...I was thinkin)
Rock the mob shit for niggas, come on y'all
(...need to, I don't know, maybe findin new hustles
Like niggas is runnin out of hustles, you know?)
When it's over don't nobody cry
Just enjoy it while you live life cause everybody gotta die
So when you see me I'll be hella high
Bendin corners with my top down checkin out the changes in the sky
Shootin paper clips at Jupiter
The mo' I learn it's like I'm gettin stupider, and stupider
Tryin to make the best out of a fucked up decision
I'm just a nigga with a vision, which is
Gettin up, gettin out, gettin my profits
Tryin to stay away from these bitches that jock dick
Movin up to move on, gotta stay true to it
That's just the way you gotta do it
And these niggas here is renegades, don't give a fuck
But if you're real, then you like it rough, nigga what?
You know it, you know what I'm sayin is real
Now step the fuck off all those standstills
Cause you're stuck
Stuck at a standstill
Stuck
To the beat one time

And now you're froze on the stretcher
You wanted trouble, I wouldn't settle for lesser
I'm the devil in the flesh, my pistol is my protector
See my reflection as it fades into black
When I reappear on a nigga it's a ragin attack yeah

And the locals you was workin with the boys in there
And even had the nerve to go and try to talk to the streets
Thinkin that they'd embrace a marked-as-police
And then you tried to sue a nigga, but it got back to a nigga
And when I see him I'mma do the nigga
So skip that funky-ass deposition fool

It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me
Will I ever, ever, EVER, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH?

Just when they thought it was safe
I picked up the phone and called it a day
I bought a new car, caught a new case, fuck it
The harder I walk, the ground shall shake
Stomping, the harder I march, the ground will break
I am groundbreaking, like an earthquake, haha!
Yeah, I run this shit, but I tackle it
You want me to break it down, I'ma fracture it
My mind is wandering, I can't find it
But ten times out of ten, my mind on the money
Bandanna 'round my head like I know karate
And I'll wax a nigga ass like Mr. Miyagi
And it ain't over 'til the fat lady sing
And that bitch got a whole lot more weight to gain
And call me by my new name
(What is that?) "Featuring Lil Wayne"

'Cause one way or the other, I'm gon' still get mine
Play the game, motherfucker
The truth is in the building, I done came to life
And I done sold so many records, change my name to "Life"
'Cause I can breathe into the hood, make it feel my pain
And even though they try to change me, I remain the same
And even if I did have that chrome-plated grille on my shit

When I was in the sixth grade, these niggas was bitch made
They was thinking science, I was thinking get paid
I always kept a plan to get doe
Like selling the same shit I use to steal from outta stop-n-go
I use to run a paper route
But that ain't pay me enough, I was still on the bus
My momma would always tell me don't you rush to get old
But rarely did I listen to the shit I was told
I was a ghetto boy long before the rap group existed
I use to take my lunch money and pitch it
I stayed on suspension, I ain't fuckin' with school
Truant officers be chasin' me, I'd give 'em the blues
Hit the pipes off of Roomer just to pass the time
Shoot the shit and walk to Shamrock, stole me a wine
Get smashed and hit the bus stop when school let out
Get off at tina house and bust that cot
Walk up outta Ridgemont smelling like fish in my pocket
Then back to the southside walking home from Watkins
I stopped to see the homies off of Huckala street
All you game in the front yard bumpin' this beat

Ever since I could remember I been on my grind
All the time
Nothing but paper and pussy and the finer things on my mind
I had to Shine
By any means necessary I had to go out and get it
And come back wit it, thug life I was wit it
My balls and my word told a nigga that the world was mine
That's why I stay on the grind
You might also like
I remember when the dope game started up, serving the hypes
I was seeing more dough than I ever seen in my life
I was rocking up eightballs and knowing the shake
Kept a thousand in my pocket, twenty more in the safe
I had my grandmother guessing how I got that shit
Cause every other day I had to buy new kicks
Older cats steppin' to me as if I was the man
Getting telephone calls from my uncle's friends
I'm sixteen years old, with game so throwed
I was parking niggas frontin' me and fucking they hoes
Eventually I moved out, rented a house
I'm stretching the dope, cuttin' seventeen from an ounce
We cop ya pots fulla spray, I'm moving big weight
But that was back in the days, nobody thought about a dope case
It's all mapped out, get in get out
They giving mutha fuckas ten years for each rock
It's fucked ain't it, but I'm lookin' at the picture they done painted
They hanging all these niggas who's careers was dope gamin'
The crack epidemic had you locked if you was in it
And even if you stepped out with bread you couldn't spend it
In the beginning niggas had they whole hoods flooded
Wit that Antonio Montana disease like "fuck it"
And drug wars just another day in the life
You fucked over me, I fucked you, done gave me the right
Ever since I could remember I been on my grind
All the time
Nothing but paper and pussy and the finer things on my mind
I had to Shine
By any means necessary I had to go out and get it
And come back wit it, thug life I was wit it
My balls and my word told a nigga that the world was mine
That's why I stay on the grind

I'm up and down I-10, with a car full of hens
Finta check my ends, finta get this Benz
Stopped short of my drop spot by red lights flashing
I'm dirty, and if he wants to search I'mma blast him
I roll the windows down so I can show him my hands
Wouldn't you know, the cop done pulled me over my man
I got a brand new plan take this shit to the line
Stop an Sony's and give it back I'll give you a dime
With ten thousand you can go to work for a week
Take some time off to think, I'll even throw in a key
He stopped at the mo', I gave him the doe
Checked in my room then whooped out the scale and the blow
There's a knock at the door, I grabbed the four-four
It was the homeboy who set me up down on the floor
Ever since I could remember I been on my grind
All the time
Nothing but paper and pussy and the finer things on my mind
I had to Shine
By any means necessary I had to go out and get it
And come back wit it, thug life I was wit it
My balls and my word told a nigga that the world was mine
That's why I stay on the grindEmbed
..."let me spit some game to ya"...

You gotta war on drugs
Well every other day a nigga dies
You showed yours, now let me show you mine
Bring the six o'clock news
And let me walk 'em in my shoes
Through what you call the inner city
And what I call the blues
I'm broke here, and I ain't wainting on a call
From a resturaunt to bust tables
When Petie's got a job
Making 35 a week and all he do is run the streets
This nigga always caked up
Chromed out and draped up
Constantly telling me we need to get this paper
I'm getting skinny and it's he who get my weight up
Straight up
And plus I'm tired of missing meals
So I paid the man a visit...
 "What's the goddamn deal?
It's good to see you dog
I thought you might've choked up
Respect and money, well I can get you both of 'em"
You might also like ...I went inside, watching him break it down
When he was finished he handed a nigga nine
A nine milimeter, nine zips
Said if I sold each one for nine, I'd have grip
I hesitated, I ain't never sold a stone
I done seen it fuck the hood up
Plus all my niggas gone
And they ain't never coming out
So with that in consideration
I took the package and bounced
I'm headed home, dazing out in a zone
Eyes on my luggage, I'm abouts to get it on
Get to the house, spread it all on the couch
Getting this bank what it's about

That's how a nigga made
They got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave
Get money everyday
It ain't no other way
That's how it is until they put me in a grave

I'm in the living room looking at the news
Got a razor and some zipper baggies
About to do the fool
Cutting hundred dollar slabs
Wholesaling niggas halves
Getting money like a muthafucka
Serivng niggas bags
Got the blocks all blowed up
The whole hood smoking
Got a pistol I ain't shot yet
So dude's wide open for it
I'm just a youngster, I ain't done it, but I will
Cause I was taught you got to get it
So I get it how I live
Finna get my ma a crib, she ain't working
So I'm forced to win the bread for the household
Cause dad was no support
Often in and out of court, caught a case out of town
Got a body on his conscience, but nobody made a sound
He was going through the motions
He gonna probably beat the case
Still I get down on my knees
And beg the Lord to let him raise
Get up and get my workers out
Supply 'em with the goods
Give instructions to the goons
To come up out the hood
I ain't gotta pay the fronters
So I'm finally finna raise
Cause the bottom line is this homie
You gotta get paid
That's how a nigga made
They got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave
Get money everyday
It ain't no other way
That's how it is until they put me in a grave
I never learned a trade
I fuck with chess and spades
The only other game a nigga learned to play was
Working hopping yay
Cause kissing ass was gay
I'm on my business, I want money like I'm jade

I'm the nigga in the hood
These little homies wanna be like
I got when shit was good
But now-a-days off in this street life
These niggas switch it on you
Quick to put you in the crosses
Now he standing in your crib
And got a pistol in your mouth
That's your muthafuckin' boy
He popped you and popped your broad
Now he headed to the closet
And he about to take it all
So watch your muthafuckin' friends
Cause them the ones that sell you out
Ain't no future in being loyal
When niggas see you want the top
Jealous hearted muthafuckas
Always quick to say you hating
I don't want another homie dog
He swallowed that and chased it
You can make it like I made it
I think it's best you do it dolo (solo)
That way niggas can't say shit about you
When talking to the po-po
Oh yo, you know that dude that fronted me my come up
I caught him coming out the neighborhood
And had him done up
That's why I'm skeptic
When it comes to different faces
Cause I know I got it coming
But 'til then, I'll get my bank, shit

..."fuck you think this is?"...
..."more food for thought"...
..."that's how this shit go
Muthafucka been foolin' you, fuckin' with you
All your muthafucking life
And he the muthafucka talking to the people
You know...get that nigga ass outta here"...
..."I ride by my muthafucking self"...
..."look for me"...Embed

I'm "Prime Time" bitch like Deion (yeah)
I Spinks on a ho like Leon
And you are just a castaway, so get your ass away
Instead of fuckin you, I'd masturbate
I shouldn't of had to wait, I think you blew your big chance
You rejected when I asked about the eighth grade dance
Now I'm big time, like my homeboy Randy
Plus I'm pushin a Porsche with drop top panties
It's just like candy but I ain't hammy
Yo ho, so yo, ass can't hand me
Shit, fuck your cell phone bitch, you can keep that
Broke, you ain't know a motherfucker, where was she at?

I think I remember you, from way back when, but how can I be sure?
That's so long ago and since then we both have grown
But look at you, you're amazin

If I wore a shirt Monday, this is true, I ain't lyin
By the end of the week you probably saw it two more times
I was discouraged by the microscopic size of my bank
But stayed constantly motivated to rise in the ranks
I used to be a bottom feeder, lowest man on the totem
But I showed a mass like the transit sit on my scrotum
Gettin fed by my music and it's all clean work
And the used to be prom queen is a Walgreens clerk
I would dream about bein with ya, wantin to kiss on ya
Now I let my damn bladder bust before I piss on ya
Me and 'face second to none, makin records for fun
You thirty-seven at the strip club gettin naked for ones

Lookin at a nigga strange, cause I ain't tryin to entertain
Conversation about her becomin my main

And think you fuckin with a lame, nope not me mayne
I ain't got shit for ya, matter fact, I don't know ya
That's all I'm a show ya, cause that's all a nigga owe ya
Used to be fine, big titties and behind

Stomach lookin like you had a fight with a lion
I ain't fuckin with you bitch, move around"

It's danger in the streets these days
Man how the fuck am I gon' keep me paid?
Believe me mayne; if I got to die I got to go
This was all never sure cause danger life I know
It was all about the diamond chains, or the ride and bank
Smoke and listen to the Isleys sang
Would I ride the same? Dawg, probably not
Laid back reminiscin on the times I shot
Dare all motherfuckers trippin in them parkin lots
If it was war niggas wanted it was war they got
I'm a nigga, a real nigga, a quick thanker
That would hesitate to aim and see the chamber
Discharge the cartridges that the hollow-point came from
You can hide but you cain't run
Yeah, and he just started what can not be stopped
And fucked up cause you were thinkin you could not be got

This is not a game
Niggas want a lifestyle with finer thangs
Hustlin to come up on these diamond chains, diamond rangs
Runnin on the daily out here tryin to slang

Now analyzin all the wrong I've done
I'm surprised I ain't dead I guess the good die young
I put a hole in a nigga head, fuck why run
From a lazy motherfucker cause he flashed his gun
We ain't cut from the same shit, nigga I'm a shooter
If I show I got a pistol best believe I'mma shoot a
Stupid motherfucker down, shoot a motherfucker down
Chalk his ass in the dirt with a bullet in his mouth
And I won't lose sleep cause when it come time for me to pay the piper
Fuck it, I've been tryin to meet
Yeah~! So please believe that when it's time to show
I'll be ready with my arms crossed, dyin to go
And I won't shed tears, I'm respected here
And you won't hear things you'd expect to hear
I rejected fear; and I don't wanna be another second here
But the question is, is he lettin me live?

My Sunday School teacher taught us Job in songs, another soul is gone
She couldn't have told me shit
Cause all I wanna do right here is fold me grip
And she talks to me in codes and all I know is bricks
Learn how to rock me up an O I coulda sold for six, instead she sold me tricks
So now I plead my case
The cops all on me tryin to bleed my safe
My pops all on me tryin to squeeze my face
But I'm not gon' squeal so I'mma need my space, back up I need my space
Momma ain't raised no rat
The word got back and niggas paid for that
Yo' ass got served and never made it back
Your ass had birds a nigga laid you flat, and then he raid your stack
That's how the game is played

It was the day that hell had broke loose, demons in the sky with the {?}
Take over the heavens and burn it over
It's darker than the hearts of men, but I ain't scared cause I'm a soldier
I walk with my weapon across my shoulder
Refuse to live, yet impossible for me to say I'd rather die
Cause I'm a killer with the devil's eye (uh-huh)
I want the world to feel my heart, my heart, my set, my set
And these niggas who contested me regret that
Poisonin my own breed to terminate yo' offerin
And may they die young and never live to cause {?}
I'm just wrapped up inside a homicidal mindstate
Destined to outrun the time it takes to catch fate
The day that shall come, that thou shalt be done
The day that I run 'til then I smile with the gun
Let off a shot and make the whole world hear it
Murder, I've written in blood, y'all fear it

As I walk through the valley of death I shall

I'm too hard to kill, I refuse to die
Sweat tears and blood, paid dues alive
In these streets I roam, I've been blessed to live
Could've easily got caught up in my yesteryears
But I'm here, My story remains the same
I ain't changed a bit, I speak words of pain
From a frozen heart, lost what's left to lose
I'm alone and what I promise is death to you
And it's true my only fear is I have none
My conscience makes me keep me to myself cause I blast one
And I can fall asleep right next to a dead man
I'm cold, I put bullet holes all off in your headband
So, bring me death cause I've been itchin to see
If it's an afterlife, aim it at me, cock it and squeeze
Please... back to back to back to back to back to back, nigga
From my first fuckin album nigga
And I still can't be fucked with, trust me
I'm the truth in here, I give up what's real
Not afraid to die, not afraid to kill
But afraid to lie, and too scared to steal
Cause what's mine is mine, and what's his is his
In these streets it's clear, punishment's severe
If that line is crossed that's when them guys appear
It's like nothin you've seen, so fuck what you've heard
It ain't what you believe, cause it's deeper than words
If that silence is broke then somebody's comin to blow
Holes in yo' upper body, leavin a bloody coat
To be viewed by these dues who feel like this
When it's enough said it's bloodshed, believe that shit nigga
Cause we that sick nigga, you see that bitch - get her!
Cause he that snitch nigga, so squeeze that's it figure
That you watch what you say, you say it and die
What you cherish is close to me so don't testify

I'm a soldier for fortune, I've got murderous plots
Plus I'm suicidal, walkin this parking lot
With my dangerous thoughts, I'm a dangerous dude
When I up it and cock the hammer I'm aimin dude

In the end he who wins is he who finishes fools

"King of Da Ghetto," whassup 'Face, big homey
I greet the Father on my knees, with a bowed head and humbled heart
My conversation is have mercy on me please
I just wanna be happy will it come to pass
Fresh out of my mind, been 27 years and every day I've seen is sad
Even though I've tried 'til I've cried I can't even stand
Feels like I've died a thousand times but just can't make it man
Ain't nuttin different about me doin dirt
Except I've never crept up on a come up maybe that's why the hustlin hurts
I remember just like it was yesterday I'm 16
Can't find no love can't find no peace I wonder what it means
Could it be because I didn't choose the devil all the time
I became an outcast to the hood, restricted to my rhyme
Where I could not just live my life without my talent makin danger
Jealousy is now state jail from friends that turned to strangers
They hate me, I don't understand why
I swear I never seen a man cry, 'til it was my own eye

I'm 21 and think I finally got a grip on life
And how bills pay the apartment, a step-son and a step-wife
But without a vehicle it's kinda hard to get around
If I got weed I ride for free if not my partners let me down
So now I'm livin to be one deep so much I'm hatin people
Lookin at everybody, even babies like they Satan people
Nobody understand me, everybody's trippin with me
Wonder why when I gotta ride when none of my people flippin with me
Too many haters tryin to take a player off his game
Not tryin to be ballerific, I'm just tryin to have some thangs
They're just like crabs in a bucket, these people pull me down
If I didn't have so many obstacles think where I could be now
On MTV or BET or in some magazine
Instead I'm stressin, hooked on codeine, headed to tragedy
Sometimes I think it's better just to die
Because I never seen a man cry, 'til it was my own eye

Pistol cocked on the block and all I'm fearin' is death
But then again nigga, roaddog you feelin' me yet
So if I died I'm tryin' to get it mamma, merely deed
And pray to God that he kept this spot in hell for me

Of a dying breed
I don't remember much about bein born
But I do remember this: I was conceived on February 10th
Complications detected in my early months of formin'
Around my sonargram you could see the evil was swarmin
The hassle, was it what the world was seekin in a child?
The doctors wanted me out, my mama's in denial
Then I kicked her and gently rubbed my hands across her stomach
Told her: "Keep em off me, mama, I'm comin, I'm comin"
Now I guess I musta been the reason mama couldn't sleep
Interrupted her peace, but it was time for me to eat
And since carryin me caused all that swimmin in your feet
Just know that I'm thankful, I'll let you feel it with my heartbeat
All the doctor visits and physicians movin me around
You could sense my discomfort in every other ultrasound
And I'm runnin out of room in here, steady slidin down
Then she opened up her legs and pushed me out (pushed me out)
(Nigga, nigga never die
Blackface, shining eye)
When I awoke I recall them walkin out my nose
Screamin at the top of my lungs, freezing cold
Wrapped me up in blankets after dressing me in clothes
Then I met the  that I owed
At 3 o'clock, what-what, nine seven o
Was the birth of a dying species, and this I know
The truth was in my bloodline, planted in my seed
The last of this muthafuckin breed

Figured it was gon rain today, so I'm in
Sit around the house until the thunder storms slacks off
Look at my nightstand, and pick the paper back up
Nostradamus, I'm readin chapter, after chapter
The predictions of the end of the world, and the after
Life, wit no beginning, as the world stops spinning
Or is this a journey that's never ending
I glance at my baby boy, I can see this in his eyes
The little nigga's glad to be alive
And as the days go by, I thank god for watchin mines
Prayin for my remain in fire
The same man that I was, but it just within another mind phrase
Was it the cash I think my time came
For me to venture off into different demensions
Of the beginning, of the ending, of my time
(Chorus: 1x)
What we fail to realize
Is that we runnin outta time
Do we ever be born again
In my time of dying
It's like I'm runnin outta time
Will I ever be born again

In my time,  I try to stay true steps on the game
And if you nigga's thinkin like me, do the same
Which is one minute ya smilin, the next we start cryin
Cause we can't accept we born to die
And I, ease my edge,  and be a nigga to the end
But it's more to life then me and my benz
When my mama told to speak to my friends
I kinda took that shit to heart
So don't fuck up your life, 'fore it starts
Some nigga's wanna be like Mike
I'd rather be like Christ
So at the end, when I see bright lights
I save a prayer for the fallen soldier's
Too many nigga's died young, for tryna to hang
And sling what I've slung
And the outcome, as mommy deals, sittin on the front row
Hopin god will accept your soul
The new millienium, and as I sit watch the distance
Ships walk the horizon, I'll stare into space while I'm drivin
And pray for me, all the ends of my sins
The beginning, the end, of my time, till I'm born again
(Chorus: 1x)
(Verse 3)
In my time, I've seen life born, and I've been blessed
Enough to see life lossed, it's just the price life cost
And shortly, explain my pain, I know I'm prone to do it wrong
So when I'm gone, life goes on
Tell my mother, when she on the front row, hold her head up
Shed no tears, and dread those years
Smile, and even though my whole life's been a po'ball
You did your's, and it's not your fault
Tell my grandmother those words too
She knows I'm headed to a better place
That'll put a smile on my wife's face
God's graced the evil spirit that surronded me
And pass me, and anytime it could'a had me
But when it all went wrong, sung the same ol' song
Now it's peace after the storm blew on
And appetite, for the better life, security for your's and mines
What the evil lies, and not so kind
In my time, it's been times, I would've stopped and called the quits
But I might as well sit until it's over wit
Eath to earth, and ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's the lord I trust
You tell me the dirt is where I come from, so I guess the dirt's where I'll return
No sorrow, it was just my turn
And in that, last trumphet sounds, put me down in the ground
But i'll proably be at home by now
And it's help will change(these helps will be changed)
Blinking of a eye, but I don't think I'll get to see that
In my time, till I'm born again
(Scarface talking)
It's changed, when we born
And how we born from woman
We born, from the spirit, of life
And all our flesh remains
And not, by the flesh of man
And not by the flesh of man
Do not believe that
(Chorus until fade)Embed
The conspiracy theory...

I knew this nigga who sittin, on the dock on the bay
Had plans of gettin rich so he was plottin with Jay
This motherfucker had the street game locked
Had the blocks all sewed up
And always slipped the cops when they showed up
He had the rep of being murderous too
The type of nigga, with the mind of a God-damn fool
But he knew, to get off in this crew, he had to change
So when James went to church this nigga did the same
So he's steppin back away from the cut
But his visions of livin, had his braincells start to fuck up
Steady callin his shots, but steady leavin a trail
So sit back peep my game, I got a story to tell

I came from a gang with niggas who do crime
They didn't rat they niggas out when they came to do time
No snitchin nobody out when ya facin a life sentence
For death, you do it by yo God-damn self

He gettin clean, so we gave him a job
Had the whole entire city on they knees, recognizin the mob
Took the cash that he was makin, in this god damn seat
And compared it, to the cash off in these God-damn streets
And he couldn't compete, the scales didn't break even
So now he's out to go an get the cash that he needin
Some wise man once told me
That greed was a disease but I didn't believe him, so he showed me
Gave an example; the piece of a pie
Said if you eat to much it's gone at the blink of an eye
This for these niggas out here hearin me
Hypothetical conversation, the rest of that shit, its a conspiracy
I got the word and heard he back on the grind
Ran across and met a nice spot, runnin his mob
I love the nigga, so I gave him some dap
He said he loved my work efforts
And he said he liked the way that I rapped
Wanted to show me what he was rollin outside, but
Little did I know, he was the FBI
I heard a rumor that this nigga got knocked...
A few months past and he was back on the lot
And shift the plot, I'll teach you niggas conspiracy theories
I spit this shit in code, but I pray that you hear me
Cause see if he knows him and, he meets you
They get popped and, you do to
Illegal taps and undercover surveillance
Tapin conversations, tryna duck the years that he facin

Bone - if ya crush the bone, ya alter the mind
And thought process is vital at this time
And I heard, you was out to get the niggas that's rich
But I'mma tell you motherfuckers like this

I came from a gang with niggas who do crime
They didn't rat they niggas out when they came to do time
No snitchin nobody out when ya facin ya life sentence
For death, you do it by yo God-damn self

How the fuck is you gon' stop a train
You set your fires on your forest to burn it but then it rains
It's like Babyface and little Jay
We organizin RAM, you motherfuckers on they grave
We need current situations, in due time
Train 'em to do the business in 20 years down the line
So I stand firm on "We can't be stopped"
Reconcile our disagreements, and I'm still down with Rap-A-Lot
Murder ya blocks tryna break apart what God made
And regardless to what you boys say
Seek and destroy, fuck the opposition
When you for real it's in yo bloodline, not in yo motherfuckin mind
So feel it like the holy spirit, and remember
When ya face to face with the demons, you can't fear it
You fight until the battle finished
No matter what the end is, when you attack you strike relentless
And always judge a man by his deeds
And never buy jealousy cause it breeds...

Hotel, motel, deep up in a ho's tail
Pussy smellin sweeter than a half a key a dope smell
Knock that top back, told her I'd be right back
Nigga where your wife at, y'all niggas don't like that
I bring a bitch the rough shit, you be on some love shit
Kiss and hold and hug shit, she be wantin thug dick
You winin, and dinin, puttin all ya time in
I be into windin, knockin out the linen
Silk pink panties, but she can't understand me
I be buyin condoms, you be buyin candy
She love you, lust me, gansta shit, it must be
All the while you spoilin that bitch, so thinkin 'fuck me'
Hard for you to see that, cause you be on that weak rap
"Ay, can I get some roses please?", nigga where your 'G' at
A gentleman, fuck that, wearin suits, what's that?
You hit the ho she lay there, I hit the bitch she fuck back
Makin voices, noises, voices and noises (moaning)
But when she do, I send her home to you
Pussy hole swole up, everytime she roll up

She tells me her problem, I like to listen and learn
And I don't mind because she's always got a Swisher to burn
And a six-pack, I sit back, chill while she drives
With her skirt pulled down and her panties to the side
Wanna smoke, what's up, open up the glove compartment
Grab the Swisher, kiss her, get my lighter and spark it
Don't know how she do it nigga but when she be drivin
She be slobbin and bobbin while she's givin me noggin
And I've been, tryin to tell myself to chill
But I find myself just takin the wheel

She followed me to the bathroom, and I ain't have to pee
I'm at the club tryin to do this little nasty freak
I met last week, you know the panties drop quick
She suck dick with two hands and a whole lotta spit
Average niggas get nervous around the bitch
Lick between her legs and run circles 'round her clit
Fall in love, she'll make your mind a wreck
When she lay on her back, and put her legs behind her neck
Sperm drinker, come in her mouth, she keeps suckin it
It's too sensitive, have a nigga sayin
'fuck this shit, bitch, can I have my dick back'
You don't wanna hit that, you don't wanna be inside that kit-cat
She's too nasty, but I like that
Pussy have you right back, fuck where your wife's at

Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see
Do you think I'm crazy??? (Argh! Just bein' me)
Sometimes, I wanna die, maybe I'll be free
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin' me
(I can feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and passed around like weed
Look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
And tell me what you see (and tell me what you see)
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line?
Is it just my test, or is it just my time?
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did
That I forgot to repent for when I was just a kid
A poison in my mind, tryna find relief
But I can't get no peace, 'cause Shoemaukers been chasin me
Tryin' to set me up, bustin down my streets
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what niggas say
Fuck Ronnie Carbone, and fuck the D.E.A
And fuck these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane
I know you crackers pissed off, I can see it in your eyes
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die
(Until the day that I die)
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie
You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my god
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth
Listen up my niggas: "The F.B.I. been watchin' you"
Especially if you black, and tryin to leave the streets
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib, makin niggas lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
But not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me?

What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
That leads me to the same place I started from;

Diagnosed my symptoms, I give you time to think
OK your time is up, now analyze my life
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes

You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes
Looked me in my eyes

I swear I feel so all alone, back down on my knees again
Hoping you can keep me strong, cause I can't hardly sleep tonight
I took too many sleeping pills, I drunk too many Miller Lites
And I can feel the Reaper near, so please forgive me for my sins
I am just another man, sorry for the pain that I've caused
I know you'll understand, but these demons are driving me insane
I've been going mad, probably oughta blow out my brains
Cause I'm hurting bad but I'm fighting... blast, on the other day
These problems got me using more drugs, along with the other things
I'm slowly fading into my thoughts, (come against me, bring it on!)
And I'm drifting in and out of space, and I don't believe I'm waking up
With the alcohol, demerol, drifting into another world
With the sunshine shinin, and I think I'm finna url
Momma, can ya look at me? This ain't what I used to be
Tomorrow, I'll be somebody else, cause I ain't been me
And I can't seem to shake these things, I'll put that there on every thing
The more I try to figure me out, is like the more I've changed
But my childhood was fucked up - raised rowdy by a single moms
She told me my daddy didn't give a fuck, she ain't let him do his job
Separate the family, and I don't know my next of kin
These days in these fucked up ways, who the fuck are them?
My daddy had three other kids, but I ain't never seen him so
Ain't no sense in coming around now, you ain't been here before
It's sad but I ain't feelin him, my whole life's been a fuckin maze
And when I tried to locate my siblings, they were gone away
Lost inside they other things, fucked me then, fucked me now
Quick to tell me "Show you some love" nigga show you how?
Ain't no love I'm feelin here, I ain't never felt this vile
Momma - did you really love me, or was I just a child?
Sad on the outside, I knew you seen it in my face
I wasn't really happy here, but I was forced to lead the way
Copped me a Chevrolet, drift away to the other side just to think
If I get to see Heaven, I can thank you for the ride
And thank you for my other kids and even though
They mommas won't admit that they can't make it but bad
Low on the child support - always been bad boo, tryna make me out to be
The bad guy that I really ain't, bitches quick to hassle me
Cause I don't see my kids enough, but I make the time to pick 'em up
But you find somethin to stick in my face - it ain't me fuckin up
It's bad enough, face to face, hoes who wanna catch a case
So bad they'll try to give me they baby - and what takes the cake
Is the whole ward is fucking her, daddy know where the weakness at
And you spoke lies to ya old mans eyes, how could you sleep wit that?
Jeopardizing everything, desperate, searching for larger life
Sacrificing the entire family, with no regards to Christ
Funny how people look at life - can take this shit for granted, right?
But then reality strikes, and changes things overnight
I thank the Lord for watching over me, though I'm prone to doin wrong
I repent religiously, hoping that the weak get strong
When the heat gets on {*wind blowing*}
Hoping that the weak get strong, when the heat get's on

I got a problem how you do that there
It's been thirteen years and ain't went nowhere
Still, one of the coldest ever done this shit
And ain't no motherfucking question know who run this bitch
I got my nigga Erick Sermon he supplied the beat
And I be in the vocal booth, supply the heat
Up in the game, for the street, these blocks and thugs
With a pistol grip shotgun to box someone
And it's a thin red line between what was and ain't
Got a $50 sack, plus I love to drink
I be in southside nigga til it's said and done
And I was always taught to take the bread and run
Here it is, the motherfucking moment of truth
I came in one deep now what you hoes wanna do
HOOK:
All these Rolex watches
It ain't shit to me
And the Cristal poppin
It ain't shit to me
Bitches out boppin
Ain't shit to me
It ain't shit to me, ain't shit to me

Man, hold up, got too much bleek in my truck
I silence niggas like gag orders
With motherfucking powderpuff I just add water
I blow you punk bitches out the frame
And I'mma make you hoes remember my name
I'm the J E S S E, J A M E S
I'm shuttin niggas down, H town is mine I bet you know now
So hush with the talk, talk
Claimin you gon' put it on the map
Well I done already done that
So follow in footsteps of the gangsta shit's finest
Since 1987, Mr. Scarface
Gosh, I'mma stop you at the moment of truth
The last man standin, now what you wanna do

Now the moral of this story here is simple and plain
Next time you mention southern rap remember the name
All you magazine niggas gettin caught up in the new shit
Just remember what the truth is
My mind playin tricks on me, Scarface is back
Diary of a mad man, nigga comin agg'
The wall, the dead, lettin niggas know I ain't a prankster
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
Smile for me now, I see the man died today, my fuel
I'm still up in this bitch, what they wanna do
HOOK:

All that talk it ain't shit to me
Big money ain't shit to me

Let's do it!
They sayin 'Face you need to slow down dude
You refer to hoes as bitches and that ain't cool
I tell 'em look out fool, I ain't Al Sharpton
My name Brad Jordan, I don't beg pardons
Don't get me wrong I got respect for black ladies
But black hoes and ladies, ain't the same baby
And lately, I've been checkin out new prospects
And you can catch me in the projects
Huntin fo' that Next Top Model
Cute with a shape like a coke bottle, suck a dick and won't swallow
Yeah, yet that's degradin her still
To ladies, if you ain't fuckin her the next nigga will
Instead of trippin on who callin a bitch
You maybe need to focus on who fuckin his chick
If you a weak nut, we bop, never hit a G spot
Nuttin too quick and scared to play with the clit
Pullin her hair while you callin her bitch
Shit you missin the point, you need to ask what she want
(Want me to stick my finger in your booty) {OKAY~!}
You can't turn a ho into a housewife
I don't give a fuck what she look like
She can have an ass like Buffy
And a face like Janet, head so good you can't stand it
But you still can't manage
To keep her off of them streets, cause she's skanless
Fuckin every nigga with a bankroll
How you fall in love with a stank ho
Now you're blowin up her cell phone and she won't answer
Trippin for a dude like a dancer
And that's sick like cancer
Man this bitch is trash and he's at her
Dawg you dealin with a fucked up babe
With fucked up ways, it's fucked up but hey!
A new day, and niggas gotta listen
And if she got some dudes that she hang with
You better watch that bitch cause she dangerous
A lady got a man at the house
A bitch got her best friend man in her mouth
And she don't give a fuck about a ring
The kid, the 15 years this brings
She'll fuck you in your house in the bed you're about
Leave the sheets full of drip stains, wash her pussy off
Then bounce, now you at home with a soft dick
Feelin bad, try to shake this bitch
But you scared of the outcome, she might tell
Or get drunk, feel guilty, come by and try to sell it
To your wife like it's yo' fault, duck at all costs
And if that ain't a bitch, what's a bitch, I'm lost
A ho will jump dick to dick to get paid
But a bitch fucks yo' shit up so just wait
Cain't nobody else prosper, she live for the gossip
Hates to see the next bitch happy so she knocks her
She hates yo' man and hates yo' friends
But a bitch is a bitch is a bitch in the end
(I know you you ain't call me no bitch)
(Talkin about a ring and a dick in the mouth)
(You just a bitch-ass nigga)
(Fuck me not your wife bitch!)

They say the world is a ghetto, I'm witnessin' a generation die
By poverty sickness and homicide
Now Momma on the front pew, askin' the preacher why
Like he knowin' what it's like to be hated and criticized
And sharks in the water create you the wrong way
When you're a target, see that's how these niggas out here behave
I hate to go to funerals, I never visit graves
Cause I'm knowin' that through this dirt that, you can't hear me when I say
That I love you dawg, and out of all them power moves I coulda' made
I focused on keepin' your family straight
I, po' out some liquor so you don't go out forgotten
I'm drownin' off in this bottle, tryin' to solve my fuckin' problems
New days changes, different than how it was
We upped it from stealin' cars to hustlin', dealin' drugs
I've seen a whole lot of good niggas die
Cause the ghetto took advantage when situations provide

That's my life, story of a nigga in the ghetto
Money minimal so we settle
For whatever they give us in the ghetto
We settle
That's my life, story of a nigga in the ghetto
Crack rock slangin' in the ghetto
Momma why you leave me in the ghetto
The ghetto

The little kids in the hood live a life with no outlets
Rap or ball playin' to survive
Devils in disguise in the fact that a nigga's broke
Makes him more prone to drop out of school and fuck with dope
With hopes of gettin' paper and chasin' his fuckin' dream
But America's got us dyin' for it waitin' for relief
The penitentiaries is filled to the max
With my people who tried to make it out but never made it back
Crack, to see yo' Momma doin' bad
Hit as hard as you see it, yo' daddy sittin' on his ass
Doin' nothin', fuck it, that's when them tears start rushin'
White powder in the coffee pot bubblin', hustlin'
I know exactly where you at dawg
Out there on the corner where the rats crawl
It's my life


I shoot it out befo' I bail, fly befo' I set sail
I'd rather die cause I could never tell
Rather see Heaven, I done been through Hell
Seen the elderly fucked by drug laws, niggas dyin' in jail
The guidelines stiffer, they sentence my people different
Instead of intervention they sendin' us straight to prison
First time offenders get tangled up in the system
For ghost dope, he went from dopeman to straight killer
It's po' folks, you livin' in the hood
But yet and still you can't survive
Cause Reagan never planned for us to rise
The war on drugs turned to a war on us
Then aids just topped it off, this shit here is fucked up
You either, eat or you starve, rob or go get a job
Break down to either wake up, hustle or pray to God
Faith is one thing without work you ain't got nothin'
Decisions from a motherfucker strugglin'

Dollar...

I'm bout my game
Can't take shit light
Rich today
Be broke tonight
I duck the pin
Cuz I seek the light
On my grind
My grind's my life
My life's my hood
My home is slums
My boys is deep
Hoes is young
Funk is here
I'm out the way
I stash the cash
For that rainy day
Those days to come
My storm awaits
I save for now
For babenapes
For cars and wheels
For grills and chains
For cows and bulls
For screens and bang
For candy paint
My life done changed
My kids is grown
I needs the bank

Got hoes with jobs
Got hoes with games
Got freaky hoes
That dance with hey
They likes my style
And I like they ways
She wants what's mine
And I want what pays
I love these hoes
Without my heart
I fucks they mind
Not private parts
They falls in lust
Dick game in truth
She leaves her man
Cuz I keeps her loose
She dreams of me
Just met the chick
She mean to you
Cuz you stressed the bitch
I takes her home
You sweat the shit
She rolls her eyes
Like the exorcist

It's in my blood
Been real for deep
Ain't changed a bit
I claim the streets
I've left the hood
But made it back
Sold cocaine
Smoked and i jacked
Prophets from crack, bought cockpits and gats
Bulldogs and hogs
My life I rap
Put down in words
Dope fiends in packs
My block I love
And they love me back
Homeboys is feudin'
Got hate for none
I rise foreal
I stay with guns
I sleep alone
Cuz I trust myself
Respect for all
But I deals in death
That's real in depth
Can't bite my tongue
I speaks my mind
That's where I'm from
That's how I'm raised
I'm cut from that
That's how I'm made

I would, never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could, never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin for they scratch
Forever pourin out liquor for 'em, God send me back
And I'll, never shed tears, my heart is like a stone now
Never thought I'd live to see 21 look I'm grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means it's forever, but it's never crossed my mind
And I'll, never go broke, I promise I'mma shine
Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be passive, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want it, every motherfuckin dime
No I, never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could, never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
Take that first breath and from then, I knew I had to mash
And it could, never be said I went out like a ho
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level ho, or get a shovel ho
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared
It's in my bloodline, the realest nigga ever bred
And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, cause I believe a
Man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God I'd stay the same
And when I finally got my paper, I was on my game

This past year was a rough ride, joking aside
A lot of niggas left to do bids, and most done died
My neighborhood is like a ghost town
Would hype some trash
The BGs got the hood hot
With whites and rats
The old folks is mad at us cause they kids is lost
How you expect for us to teach when all you did was talk
The trickle down theory but this generation of thugs
Ain't nothing like my niggas was when was hustling blood
It went from weed to cocaine
Cocaine to drank
Drank to handlebar, heron, x and crank
Smokin' dip, plottin' homicies, killin theyself
Butt naked waving pistols round the feeling of death
Got mama crying, cause she know deep down they needin' her help
But he's a dead man walking, still she pray for his health
Why did Cory have to die young
I'm losing my friends
Fought the war against Cancer
But he lost in the end

Outside I see the cop cars flashin they lights
Raindrops symbolizing God is saving the life
The sun shining so they say the devil beatin his wife
The body bloody underneath the sheet is waitin for Christ
The streets is hungry so I know they watchin'
Waitin' to strike
But anything you ever got for easy
Came with a price
Its just the chance a nigga took
He was shaking the dice
Committed suicide to get his chain covered in ice
I ain't 'gon lie I did the same thing
I wanted to shine
25 and had a drop Rolls
Top of the line
I came a long way from rockin' up
Ounces or dimes
To moving big boys
4 or 5 blocks at a time
And since this rap it wasn't paying bills
I did what I did
Got my money for it
Let these niggas see how I live
Wrong answer
You'd think a motherfucker be proud
To see his homie on his feet instead of talking him down

Now if the ghetto ever made a change
It changed for the worse
But I love it so I write in tears
And pray til it hurts
Prick my fingers
Til the blood stains would cover the page
Wipe my eyes and look ahead
And hope to see better days
I turn my TV off
Cuz I don't wanna look at the news
Hard times seeing people crying
Arabs and Jews
Fighting for they religion
Niggas livin like niggas
Mexicans on the border
White boys saying kill em
Politicians playing puppet
Gotta answer me this
Do you believe you really God?
My answer is this
Did you say
Let there be light, give Adam his wife
Produce the vegetation
Separate the day from the night?
Create the land and the sea and man in your own image
If not, then I want all this bullshit ended
Sending the kids to fight a war that they ain't have to be in

Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again, 'cause he's in a grave
Hey yo, let's think about it, nilla
"My daddy was a dopeman, so I'ma be a dope dealer"
How will the family explain it?
"My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!"
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation's got me guessin
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die

It was crazy how it happened
Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled "get an ambulance"
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You shoulda seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up
Followed by a lawman and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher
But if he survives, I'm willin to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week, he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by Worthing on Scott Street
School was lettin out
"Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?" "WATCH ME!"
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun
He shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked Black’s brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullen
His brother was just dazed in a shock, "Why you do it?"
"Why you shoot his moms Jay? Shit"
"Hehehehehe.. hah man fuck that bitch"
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, "Aiyyo J.D. homie"
Hung it up and rolled down Dacca
Headin for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven niggas all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the Acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray
And a second to die1Embed

Seen that Adam had a weak spot and she was right
I just call it how I see it, she in love with him
And he in love too but still be fuckin' all of them
Can you imagine you on lock with one breeze for life?
Wakin' up in the mornin' and layin' down at night
With the same face lookin' at you all the time
Realizin' now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus she's always mad and her sex ain't great
And she don't suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into tryna find him somethin' new

But we can't be seen and for this, I can blame you
Because you got more miles than a F-350
You been ran through and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met, I've been hearin' your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Comin' out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite
And make a man out him quick 'cause how you handle the dick
It's unlike no other, she a bad muh'fucker
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover
Make me look fucked up, 'cause unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you can't get mad 'cause I am not your man
Your understandin' was bad, it was not my plan
For you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that
No, you can't be my girlfriend (Girl you know, aw)
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
Girl you know I-I-I, girl you know I-I-I love you
No, you can't be my, you can't be my girlfriend (Aw baby!)
And we can get it on and on and on (Girl you know, aw)
I'm gone when the sun come again (Girl you know I-I-I)
Can't be my girlfriend (Girl you know I-I-I love you)
You can't be my, you can't be my (Aw baby!)

For me to say that "I do" would be a lie 'cause I don't
Believe no woman is right for me so I won't
Try to talk myself into thinkin' she is
And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch
And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman, there's a man, home man
Sayin', "Damn, I done spent six years in this shit
The first two was cool then the bitch just flipped"
And then that's it, had to make some new plans
'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
Now you hurt all alone, steady hittin' her phone
Bought a bigger dick and longer bankroll, she gone
And if I ever say, "Maybe" and you thought that I might
You consider, just imagine what my wife was like
And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone
No, you can't be my girlfriend (Girl you know, aw)
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
Girl you know I-I-I, girl you know I-I-I love you
No, you can't be my, you can't be my girlfriend (Aw baby!)
And we can get it on and on and on (Girl you know, aw)
I'm gone when the sun come again (Girl you know I-I-I)
Can't be my girlfriend (Girl you know I-I-I love you)
You can't be my, you can't be my (Aw baby!)

Girl, sorry baby! (Haha, woo)4Embed
I'm a born killer, you're face to face with Scarface
You tried to ice an ace, but that's a motherfuckin waste
You smooth fucked up, G
And your momma shoulda warned you bout a nigga like me
Cause I don't weep and I don't sleep
Save that motherfuckin flack, cause talk is cheap
And uh, since you got beef
Lets take it to the streets and I'm a bring it to your ass, G
I'm coming from the heart son
And I don't take no shit, but I'm about to start some
Now which one a you hoes wanna jump
If you got static, then get it off your chest punk
Cause I ain't barring none
If you're feeling lucky then go ahead and getcha some
I ain't with this fucked shit
If ya ain't in trick, then get your ass in ya trunk bitch
Cause I'm about to square it off
Hit your ass in the chest with the Tec and try to tear it off
Send you back to mommy, in some plastic
And have the bitch out hunting for a casket
I'm on the for realla tilla my nilla
I'm a born killer

I'mma born killer
Born
Killer
"Don't fuck with me"
You might also like
My momma did her part
But it ain't her fault that I was born without a heart
In other words I'm heartless, duke
I don't love me, how the fuck I'mma love you?
That's right, you guessed it
I'm legally insane, marked manic depressive
I'm taking all types of medication
To keep me out the mood of premeditating
Yo, the longer I'm alone it's worse
I'm having thoughts of killing me, but I'm killing you first
My psychiatrist talks but I don't listen
A victim of society fucked by the system
My whole life's been a see saw
I'm up one day, down and out on tomorrow
Right now I'm even more upset
Some shit done happened to me that I don't think I'd ever forget
You think I'd let it die, but I ain't
It ain't because I want to, its because I can't
I'mma getcha but I ain't going into it
Cause ain't nothing to it but to do it
See it ain't no sweat to me
Cause in the first place, you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
I'm not your average dealer
I'm a born killer

Now I'm living where I can cause I'm homeless
Can't make important calls cause I'm phoneless
I ain't eating, I'm starving duke
I can't go to momma's house cause momma's starving too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause that's the only way a nigga's gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushing that panic switch
I'm getting paid and you're getting killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dying ho, and can't nothing save ya
I'm doing bad, so I'm going bad
Huh, and you never expected that from Brad
But it's a lot of things pressing me
And I ain't the nigga to let a mortician be dressing me
So I'm coming out winning
A hundred thousand in the case now I'm coming out grinning
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pull a ho move
He reached for his pistol
The 10 gauge went "BOOM" should've heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one of you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth
And that's how it is, nigga
I spared a couple of lives, but I'm still a born killer

Yo anybody seen my diary? Oh there it is
I gotta write this shit down. Check it out

Dear Diary, I'm having a little problem
I can't make it by myself maybe you can help me solve em
I'm confused and I don't know what to do
I'm hoping you can help me cause there's no one else to talk to
I want to die, but it ain't for me
I try to talk to my dad, but my old man ignores me
He says I'm delirious
And I drink too much, so he doesn't take me serious
But little does he know I'm really losing it
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
I be thinking deep
That's one of the reasons at night I can't sleep
I thought it would change when I was older
But even now I'm still peeping over my shoulder
Is there life after death too?
And what about the nigga with the cane and the black suit?
And what about cancer?
Too many motherfucking questions, and not enough answers
Ain't no use in trying
We might as well face it we were all born dying
There's a black book in Brad's hands
And its the diary of a madman
You might also like
Dear diary today I hit a nigga with the torch
Shot him in his face and watched him die on his front porch
Left his family heartbroken
Flashbacks of him laying there bleeding with his eyes open
I can't put the shit behind me
I'm know I'm here somewhere, but I can't find me
I used to be a drug dealer
On the fo rilla, but now I'm a born killer
And it ain't no changing me
It used to be hard, but now it ain't no thing to me
To go up to a nigga's house
Put a pistol in his mouth, and blow his fucking brains out
No doubt if you cross then I'ma take ya
Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature
You got an M11, bring your weapon
Huh, I got an AK-47
It's gonna be a bloody Sunday
Cause your fucking with a nigga like Bundy
And I was taught not to care
Like a Vietnam vet with a thousand-yard stare
So welcome to the slaughterhouse nigga
Redrum and I'ma be the grave digger
And if you want to cap, come cap me
I'm trigger happy like my great-grandpappy
Just watch for the chrome in my right hand
My second entry from the diary of a madman
Dear diary, help me 'cause I'm frantic
Sometimes I think I'm going schizophrenic
The world's looking dark for instance
Maybe 'cause I'm looking from a distance
But then again I wear a blindfold
Staring at the motherfuckin world with my eyes closed
To myself, I'm a stranger
Walking in the footsteps of danger
It's a long path ahead of me
I gotta get somewhere 'cause everybody here is scared of me
I had a job but they fired me
My wife walked off, now I'm living in my diary2Embed
Mikey woke us up when he beeped us
Said he found some dope, not only good but it was cheapest
Gave me the numbers, I said "Yo B
My nigga Mike done found some bricks 11-7 a ki" (yeah)
It didn't sound legit, but still we chanced it
And if it came through, we hit a big lick
11-7 real clean
Then turn back around and sell them bitches for 17
We gathered up the money, we could score six
Headed out to meet him with 2 uzi's and four clips
Ready for whatever
If we went down, we went down together
We met him in his complex
Niggas were hanging out, "You ready to roll?" (Bet)
I knew it was fuckery
Wanted to see the money, said he never trusted me
But I can understand that
I got the money right here, now where's the fucking dope at?
Now it's the time for the testing out the dope
To see if it's flour, sheet rock, or some powder soap
He went to his car to go and get it
And never came back, oh shit, I wasn't with it
Got me real mad
Now that's the first example of a good girl gone bad
You might also like
Sticking around would be real dumb
Fuck this shit, I ain't waiting to see the outcome
I hopped in my muthafuckin' shit
Steady peepin' out my rearview, ready to shoot a bitch
I got on the phone and called Chief
He got 'em up with Jay, and I told him where to meet me
These niggas be jacking you in Texas
Met up at Obsession and tossed the money in the Lexus
I'm on my way back to the crib
Bido was noddin', now guess what these niggas did
Tried to run us off the freeway
I slammed on my brakes, grabbed my shit and got ready to spray
And that's about the time B woke up
Popped in his clip, and lit him a smoke up
Doing about 90 trying to catch him
We spotted the bastards and commence to shooting at em
Somebody was riding in the trunk
The bitch flew open, there was a nigga with a pump
He aimed at the windshield (Duck!)
Blasting the seat and in our face (Aww fuck!)
Jay and Chief must've followed us
Pulled up beside him, and pulled out the ride gun
Put the driver's ass in check
We veered to the left and watch the muthafuckas wreck
We exited the freeway fast
A perfect example of a good girl gone bad
Now it's time to do him
Called up Mike to help us find him cause he knew him
My nigga was real pissed
'Cause them hoes that had him mixed up in the middle of this fuckshit
We followed Big Mike in his jeep
Snuck up on him and caught his ass in his sleep
His little boy was sleeping with him
I had to wake him up cause it was time to get him
But I ain't give a fuck what he done
I ain't gonna kill him in the presence of his fucking son
So I drug him outside
He started to beg
"Bitch be the fuck quiet"
Took him to the bayou
Your ass has got to go for that bullshit you tried bro
"But what about my son?" I got him
He's in real good hands, he closed his eyes then I shot him
Now his son is calling me dad
I got something more valuable than money, from a good girl gone badEmbed
Niggas get stomped when they step with that bullshit
If you got a firearm, go ahead and pull it
Cause I'ma put it dead on ya ass when you reach
I got a little friend on my shoulder that I think you oughta meet
A 9 millimeter, that'll stop him
Get his ass in focus, once I focus I'ma drop him
Boy you should have known not to fuck with me bitch
Brothers like me are making mortuaries rich
So if you got something that you think you wanna prove
You better prove it now
'Cause you don't get a second chance dude
One chance is all you get
And if I beat you to the draw, that's it
Get your mom a black dress and call your family
'Cause it's gonna be a murder
My reason? Insanity

I was born with a chip on my shoulder
Now that I'm older, momma's talking shit but I told her
"Mind your fucking business" I love the girl to death
But I don't wanna hear it, save your fucking breath
I know my time is coming, and I ain't gonna lie
I may be scared of Jason, but I'm not scared to die
So when a nigga talk shit, and I buck 'em
Shoots me in the head, put me in a box, and just say "fuck him"
Later on that day I heard gunshots
A bunch of niggas running
(Aye, aye yo, Akshun, yo, Akshun, that nigga got shot!)
Ran to the corner "What happened my brother?"
He just laid there shaking, bleeding like a muthafucka
God damn!! "Who was that, that offed him?"
"Some niggas from your hood triple crossed him"
Get your shit together, we're heading for the village
I think its time to pay them hoes a little visit
Them niggas don't understand me
It's gonna be a murder
My reason? Insanity

Pulled up in a Rider, trailer full of niggas
MAC-10, TEC-9's, all with fingers on the trigger
Backed in the bitch like I was staying
Opened up the trailer, *gunshots* South Park started spraying
Bullets flying everywhere, niggas getting struck
Had dope in the village, but I didn't give a fuck
Shoot the bitch up, then I'ma leave her
If I can't sell my dope, then you can't either
Now here's a valuable lesson to learn
You fuck with mine, you get burned
Headed for the nigga who shot my partner
*Gunshot* Shot his father
Walking through the living room, tearing up shit
He's loading up his pistol, ain't that a bitch
You shoulda had it loaded, he said "Come on Scarface, hold it
I won't do it again man"
Yeah, I know it
I told you when you take mine, I take yours
Hands in the air, fell to the floor
"Please don't shoot Scarface"
I looked him in the eye - then I shot him in his face
A sucka's way out is to steal 'em
Dad said "Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
It had to be a murder, them hoes couldn't handle me
"What's your reason man?"
InsanityEmbed
Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... watch ya step...

And ya don't stop, so I guess it's on once again
The Natural Born Killaz in a zone again
I'm different type of special men not known to man
I refuse to loose, I was born to win
A street nigga, the stand up type, never to fall
I've been programmed to run in and get it, take it all
Sit back and capitalize off mistakes you made
Beat yo ass into submission, and make you pay
I got battlescars from fuckin with this, I gotta have it
What's my reason for quotin this shit? I gotta have it
Like the Roy Jones - you see this money get me hungry like a wolf
And when a nigga hungry I'm a wolf
That's when I start my rage, and attack from the neck up
Catch you being careless, make these hoes respect us
Survival here, that's the name of the game
It's the jungle in this bitch and ain't a damn thing changed
Watch ya step

Let's get it on y'all, to the beat y'all
Fuck a bitch y'all, I'm from the streets dawg
So what it is huh? What it look like?

Only a few niggas stand up strong and don't whine
When the time get passed around huh?

How the fuck is you gon' live on these streets?
You got that jacket on ya back
You a rat and you done spilled ya guts

They say that music is a therapy to ease the mind
But see therapy to me, is to squeeze a nine
Right between ya eyes, while I squeeze ya throat
Chuck you off the side of my boat and watch you float
The animal they sent here to seal ya fate
Tie ya hands behind ya back and feel ya face
Ain't no hope for ya partner Joe, he broke the rules
In the jungle if ya weak, we gotta smoke ya fool
Ain't no love for motherfuckers who done crossed the line
Cocked dice don't pay nigga, now roll ya five
You wanna play the gun game with me, then pull ya shit
I know you'd love to try to punk me if you could ya bitch
But I'm a diehard nigga, I was sworn to silence
And if I got to go, then I (?)
So fuck you, and them niggas that you run with fool

Here it comes fool, I play the game where it's no rules
Homies on the cut call me Joe 'cause I'm so cool
Quick to get 'em up with a nigga, I ain't dodgin' em
Win, lose, or draw in the hood, I'm squabbin' em
Representin' the Park since I'm living here
Walkin' through the hood from another set, give it here
And after the jackin', you still want more? Heh
Fuck your posse, it's time for the coroner
Don't fuck with the Park niggas swarm
More niggas found dead in my hood than in Vietnam
Rollin' seven deep to a car
Quick to take that ass to war, yo
It ain't no sleep being lost
'Cause territorial rights are being enforced
So when you're rollin' up Holloway, floor it
And if a nigga flags you down keep going
Don't stop and sell your soul
You'll fuck around and get your ass P.D. rolled

The last album passed gold
And you wanna know the meaning of P.D. roll
Well I'ma break it down for you real clean
*gunshots* Y'know what I mean?
In other words, getting blasted
Shootin' at a bastard, to see if he can last it
9 times out of 10 he can't
That's just one more nigga in the paint
You see when I go to work, I hit a muthafucka where it hurts
Starting off at his home site
And fuck up a nigga's whole night
You out of there, just like that there
For jumping in the ring with a bear
It's easily executed
Put the pistol to the head, cock the hammer back, and shoot it
You can't get it no cleaner
Make a hit, break quick to the Beamer
Head south, take us to the hole
And don't be no fool and get your ass P.D. rolled

And got his hands out like I owe him
But I don't owe dat nigga
I was growing in the hood until I got bigger
I hollered at my boys in the game
And only a couple of em changed
Peace to Q-Dog, Cool Coin, and Old Mack
And all the rest of my boys down with Ak
The rest ain't about jack
But I still love the hood, so it ain't about that
It's all about being down with it
Shit, to be got, you gotta go out and get it
Like my nigga doing time in the trunks
Now that was a down muthafucka
A couple of keys, my nigga stole 'em
Straight up fucking P.D. roll 'em
So lay it down in the dirt
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt
That's how it is, and always will be
I had to have it, even if it killed me
The sight of losing didn't thrill me
So I had to go and steal G
Just to make a quick one
And I didn't give a fuck who fell short to be a victim
You or your family, bro
Your ass out of line, your ass got P.D. rolledEmbed
I'm on a rampage been forced to look at darkness
Brought up being heartless
And with the gauge is how I'll guard this
Quietly I sit plottin hits like a lunatic
Waitin for a bitch to start some shit so I can hit'em
With a string of bullets comin from a TEC-9
Warned you not to test mine
And if you make it you'll know next time
That if you fuck with me I'm gonna get ya, and when I catch ya
You'll be a victim of the one they call the body snatcher

Many claim to be a gangsta, but that gangsta ain't a gangsta
That gangsta is a prankster, yeah, a prankster's how I rank ya
At the sight of blood, you hold your stomach then you're runnin
Hands over your eyes and like a ho you start to vomit
See I ain't never backed up, I just rack up as they sack up
And giggle at the niggas when they die while bodies stack up
Like I said before The DJ Akshun's my identity
A homicidal maniac with suicidal tendencies
The judge'll try to sentence me to 10 I'll never blink
He'll change it say I'm psycho and just send me to a shrink
20 months I'm in seclusion and my heads filled with confusion
Got a feelin that I'm losin so I've come to this conclusion
I gotta get the fuck out I can't take it anymore
Caught a watchman at his post so I rushed him to the floor
I was thinkin to myself, "what if his posse comes to get me?"
I know if I'ma die, I gotta take some niggas with me
Put my hands around his neck, began to choke him
Grabbed his pistol out his holster then I smoke him
Waited a second I heard motherfuckers comin
Grabbed an extra box of shells and started runnin
Now I'm the nigga cops are runnin after
It's time to snatch some bodies 'cause im the body snatcher

No questions asked, they pulled out their shit and shot
You hoes should've got back on the bus wet

Caught up with the punk-ass shrink who sent me
Put my pistol point-blank, and popped till it was empty
One bad motherfucker comin at ya
Peace, from the body snatcherEmbed
Mr. Mr. Scarface been walking down the block
Out jumps some fiends and steals all his rocks
Pulls out a gun and shoots down all the fiends
And Mr. Mr. Scarface went up the block again

All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have, all I have, all I have in this world

Ahh yeah, hah
Mr. Scarface is back in the motherfuckin house once again!
Yea, droppin some of that new
Mr. Scarface Two, on your motherfuckin ass
So suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Or something, bitch

I don't give a fuck about the chatter in the background
Niggas get beat when they step this is Ak's town
If you don't know, I recommend you check
And ask them motherfuckers how many heads I put to rest
I play a game but the game ain't roulette
Slangin 'caine is the thang and I bet
That there's a lot of wannabe Scarfaces
I've heard the name in ninety-nine different places
I'm here to squash it all original will speak
Scarface on your ass from the streets
I left my cut, in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn
But go to prison on a murder rap, fuck that
I refuse to be a visitor at state's camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war
And many want to know why I've slowed up
It's either that or get fucked
Cause laws get happy on the trigger
Say fuck it put a cap in a nigga
But this ass ain't made for no caps, homie
This ass says 'Exit Only'
So I get in the wind but hey
A nigga still sold a quarter everyday
I sat around for six months black
Waitin for the day to make a comeback
And now I'm ready for combat
Mr. Scarface is back

One nigga got pissed
And started reachin' for his shit

Unloaded on his ass, he was hurt
Six shots put his dick in the dirt
Laid him out like a motherfuckin' rug
Gettin' pumped full of .38 slugs
Some other niggas stepped out y'all

J. Prince: Hello?

J. Prince: Wassup?

Scarface: I'm out here in South Park Village
J. Prince: Stay right there, I'll be right on
Scarface: C'mon let's take these motherfuckers to war man

J called up some niggas from the 5th Ward
And came back with a motherfuckin hit squad
Motherfuckin Uzi machine
Big Chief packed an M-16
Will an AK with a banana clip
And little Bill had a god damn pistol grip
I hit a little laugh and got me a buzz
And that's about the time they got drug
One more war took place
You can call me the shit starter, or call me Mr. Scarface

It was kind of strange I was throwed off
The last bitch got her head blowed off
But fuck I ain'tsta pass up no puddy
She started strippin' at the door, oh goody
I got in that ass with the quickness
Fuckin her down with the diznick
I didn't have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just fuck her
So I gave it up to the lady
And all she said was "Fuck me baby, fuck me baby"
I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin' at my twelve gauge
The bitch was makin noise I said I'm killin her
And all the while my dick was hard and he was still in her
I made a nut as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head
Who is it? (Fred) Who?
Who the fuck is Fred, I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the fuck was I do?
The bitch packed a twenty-two
Hit him in his head, there she laid him
The nigga standin' by the door I sprayed him
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown Cadillac
It kinda fucked me up at first
Cause the nigga that drove that Caddy rode away in a hearse
I opened up fire on the ride G
Who I was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my ass
Could this be the end of Mr. Brad?
I don't know what happened to the slut
Well that's about the time the closet door it opened up
(On your ass trick!
I'll be damned if I go out like the last bitch!)
Heh, five-0's on my ass, mane
They know me by the face, but they don't know my last name
Now I'm back on the case
Yeah, just call me Mr. Scarface1Embed
I woke up to a tune on the radio, check it
An old church hymn behind a breakbeat record (yeahhh)
Sounded kinda funky so I pumped it, right
But rudely interrupted by a neighborhood street fight
When will you motherfuckers quit?
Every motherfuckin mornin it's the same ol' bullshit
I peeped to see the thrashin
Some nigga runnin with a butcher knife, screamin out "Assassin!"
He ran by a friend of mine, it bugged him
His eyes showed fear, that's the reason why he stuck him
Anyway, that's how I seen it
You rarely see a nigga kill another nigga
And he doesn't mean it
So that's the way I took it
Anyway the boy is dead, no matter how you look at it
And life goes on
I was feelin kinda funny (ayo something's wrong)
I went to take a shower Duke
Bumped into the wall and I smooth went through
Now I'm thinkin I'm in trouble
I reached to touch my face, but I couldn't feel my beard stubble
I screamed, "Oh Lord help!"
Looked into the mirror and I couldn't see myself
I called up my mom's house
And realized somethin was wrong, no doubt
She picked up, said "Hello" in a low tone
I said, "Hey ma!" and she hung up the telephone
Sick and lookin weary
My cousin walks in, I said, "What's up?" but he didn't hear me
Started packin up my shit G
Looked at a picture of me, put it down and said, "Rest in peace"
Realizin what he said man
I can't talk, I don't exist, I'm a dead man
Yeah I guess I'm dead right?
I'm goin to the cemetery to peep out Akshun's gravesite
And sure enough, there it is
My mom and girl talkin, holdin on to Brad's kids
I look into the box G
Son of a bitch! I don't believe it, that's me!
Momma kissed me on my head
Aww shit.. I'm dead (I'm dead)You might also likeEmbed

Hold them up where I can see them, or take a slug, bitch
Cause if you make a false move it'll cost ya
No need to cry for help, the world just lost ya
And I don't give a fuck about no witnesses
Witness this (gunshot)
Make it so you can't be fingered out
If you gotta kill a bitch, let 'em bring her out
Have no mercy when you jack
Dress the whole motherfuckin family up in black
Fuck a five-oh, you gotta bail out
Or your black ass is headed for that jailhouse
People all the judges wanna bust you
The D.A. does the hangin, he agrees because he's fuckin her
Ain't no redneck judge gonna boot
A nigga like the Brad cuz a nigga like the Brad shoots
Don't be afraid my brother
Put your finger on the trigger, close your eyes, and squeeze the motherfucker
Fuck the press, you gotta pop a chest
If they don't cooperate, grab some hostages
Kick an old bitch in her pouch
Skull an old nigga, knock his motherfuckin dentures out
Push an old man out his wheelchair
He's still there and squeals there, he gets killed there
If it's left up to me, I'd bury em
They got a nigga livin in a sanitarium

Motherfuckers check your nuts, and try to play a nigga weak

You hoes who's givin up the pussy for the riches
But a nigga like me don't pay shit
To put it blunt to you homie, don't play bitch
So open up and let me get it
Me pay for the pussy? Bitch quit it
Ain't no pussy in the world worth cash flow
Put bank in your ass, oh no
It ain't no way, motherfucker
You can be the world's best dick sucker
But you still don't fit on the payroll
I run game on a bitch and lay low
And let her roll with someone else
And let the other motherfucker play his self
Let her get his cash flow
But I'm still gettin that ass bro
Let the other nigga keep her
But every time you fuck her ain't that pussy gettin deeper?
I bet it kinda makes you wonder
When you're home all alone, "Yo, Akshun place is farther"
Ha ha ha, thought you had her
But when you fall asleep, yo, she's rolling with the Bradster
I peep out game and just chill
You gave her money for rent, but honey paid my light bill
It ain't like a nigga ain't rich
But a bitch has gotta pay for this dick
Reverse the game, get her hooked
Yo, her ass got took

And that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either
Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's

Where am I gettin the money? Mickey D's ain't paid me shit
I'd make up a story, just to get her off my back
Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin hard, stackin paper like Trump
And I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didn't worry about no static, I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word em up, a nigga sprayed 'em
Momma told me shoot first, and ask questions later

Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin Lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause Ak'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggas stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggas up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin noise

I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
Had to find my place
But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
Had to dodge a case
Had to dodge a bullet
And the nigga that tried to pull it
The streets is throwed
If I don't get lean and blowed everyday
I feel just like I'mma explode on overload and overdrive
All my life this drive I tried
I seen a lot of good niggas die
Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
Or somebody's a bitch
I wish I could change the past
But I gots to live in the present and pray
That tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast
Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me
But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself
Out the house she had to throw me
Just to show me just how good I had it
I guess I couldn't see it
Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it
But that was just the way we used to G it
One of the wrongest niggas I see
Or one of the strongest niggas I know
Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know
So I put weed in the bong and I blow
Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
Child that grew into a man that's widely respected
Too real

I can't complain
Stuck in the game
Tryin to maintain
Cause I'm so real

We blow big everyday
But that don't stop our pain
Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
Got niggas doin 40
When you 25 that's life
I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
These bitch ass niggas shife
Niggas might snitch out they momma
That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
Cause we ain't promised tommorow
But nigga you promised to die
Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
At night I talk to God and try to understand
How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back
So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
I still love my piece and chain, wood grain and big head ones
But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun
I guess that's true for some
But them hoes will never win
Out here just hustlin and grindin
Tryin to change from niggas to men
Chorus
(3-2)
My nigga you a ho to me
Boy you done went off on me
Runnin round with the fakin and hatin
I'mma blast if you run up on me
I'mma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch
This matter coulda been resolved
If you woulda came clean and paid my shit
See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last
Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass
And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up
No respect for your family that's dead
Don't write yo peoples locked up
Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game
Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name
You boys is funny
I'm bout my money
And oh so true
Mr. 3-2 when I never trusted you
I'm too real

I flip, make hits, and stick like peanut butter
Five g's to the homie my money he didn't stutter
The gutter with the gats, fuck that, we need the lucho
It ain't no in between such things as being neutral
We shoot y'all, answering to me if it's needed
Catch you in the bucket and fuck it we gon feed it
We bleed it, A-K spray and nine milla
You fuckin with a killa for scrilla
Money wanna deala
Peel 'em from the back and fact, you're ass out
Throw you in the trunk, we bump and mash out
We blast out and get the fuck outta dodge
And leave your body corpse parked at the Travellodge
You can't reason with a fool with guns and no brains
Thrown off your balcony get stoned and let's remain
We stressed main, paper come up short
Plus this bitch with my baby tryin to take me to court
I need a new quarter, plus my screws is loose
Makin niggas wanna pour shit down like orange juice
I one two, and slap the fuck outta you
So go on about my business bitch, and do what you do
You like to run shit
Do what you do
You fuck with powder bitch?
Hey yo, do what you do

But if it's fuck me bitch, then it's fuck you too
If you build a heist

Man, I met this chick so fine
So bad she made me sick sometimes
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in The Galleria shopping
Buying gifts for some guy that she dating, still jocking
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs, she started smiling
So I handed her this bathing suit, and told her "Try it"
Replied, "Why?" with light brown eyes
"I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size"
She put it on so I paid for it, and then I told her she could keep it
Then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it, made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I've done it, made mack move with girl chasing me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless, but honey must've missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just humping and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes, she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, it's me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces
You might also like
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

I called her up on the phone, said "I'll be there in a minute"
'Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good, have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all that shit
Every chance you get, you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her, got to stop and look
'Cause she so damn fine, bitch
I want to make you mine, bitch
I want to fuck one time, bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind, bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with, stuck with
I love the way she suck dick, and make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't, I knew the bitch would
'Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you know you ain't gon' last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
'Cause it's like that
That's how we do this shit, bitch
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 3: Devin the Dude}
Let me holla at 'cha, B; Short, check this
Just got through fucking this bitch
Who swallowed my cum and drunk my piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or move it
Sucking and fucking, mayne, she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6, nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch, and she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all the time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas, dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me, chewing my nuts like bologna
Then click, she licked on my dick like plop
Then nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said "Look what I got"
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard and rock is what these hoes be missing
And in return, she used a stolen credit card to by me cases
And later on she get this bone and gives me fuck faces
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 4: Tela}
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying it's about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we gon' do is fall through with crushed ice
Man, these hoes been talking 'bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick, it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and it's quiet
The Remy that she give me, and feel me, it's tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties, so damn me, it's in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat-ass eyes
Rochelle who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See, I love these kind 'cause they ain't with that bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl, stop licking right there, you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and feel the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me sit through
Damn hoe, I must admit, that's why I dig you
So I put you to the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex chases
You know what I'm saying, baby? It's either now or never
Too $hort, Tela, Devin, Scarface in style

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
You must be used to all the finer things...10Embed
I like pussy, pussy's got me crazy
Well-shaped, light skinned, clean lady
Slapped me on a rubber, my brotha
And dived straight for the covers

And I'm done once I bust me a nut
You can even suck it baby
Dick suckers just drive me crazy
Aw yeah, suck it fast
Now wet your tongue slide it across my ass
Lick the cum from my dick
Yeah, that's it
Now turn over on your stomach
Open up, and let me run it
Get in that ass, bitch

And a real quick nut
Knocked on my door at ten thirty
The first thing she said was don't hurt me
I cracked a little smile and just laughed
And got dead in that ass
I had the bitch screamin bloody murder
My next door neighbors even heard us
But I ain't give a fuck, my brother
The bitch shouldn'ta came by to let me fuck her
Pulled it out and laid it on her chest
And put her titties to the test
I need a hole that's snug like a glove
I had to get a little dookie love

So I can tell you what’s the haps, and who got capped for riches
And send you pictures of naked bitches
I remember when I used to get beat with extension cord
And be ashamed to show my friends where my house was
Started stealing out my mama’s purse
Now that she’s gone, she lives through my songs and it sure hurts
How come we treat our children worse than we were treated in the ghetto?
And turn our women into widows?
Sick of seeing my homies that I ate with, drank with
Played with, laughed with, dead in a casket
To my folks, we can reach the top, but
You gotta shit or get off the pot, fuck

So what you claimin'
Peep the game that's bein' spit
Tell dem niggas who ain't listenin'
That Southside's the shit
I'm screamin' "Dirty South"
While I'm chuckin' up my deuce
Dedicated to my down ass niggas
The South trues, the Southside

Southside, nigga what, nigga southside
Bitches comin' down from outta town
With they mouth wide open
Scopin' out the popped trunks, trippin'
Off the candy paint, drippin'
Elbows and vogues slippin'
Lookin' for sumtin' to happen
And thinkin' that these streets are cool
And I'm the fool to show 'em 'round
'Cuz I be rappin'
That's when I let 'em know
Ho, there's no southern hospitality
'Cuz when dey get here
Then the southern fatality
I ball
Wit a group of niggas when it's time to do a job
Fuck these groupie bitches smokin' drankin' with the squad
Because it gets crazy after dark
They keep they hands on they gun
From 5th ward to South Park
The Southside


Bitches and hoes, jewelry and clothes
Money to fold, afterparties and shows
That's how it goes in this dirty hole
Southside muthafuckas need to let 'em know that uhh
(Niggas ain't playin' in Texas)
Even our bitches be bouncin' in bubble Lexus
In the 'llac, in the back, wit yack
That's our thang
Niggas got game and you slang like main
I been around the world and I-I-I-I
Love my Southside niggas
I don't know man
I don't know why, why
We some live ass niggas
Makes no sense how they pimp in the Chi
I'm gone ball from the H to the M 'til I die
A-T-L, what the hell, you know Atlanta be live
In between New Orleans, shit , we 'bout it and high
Come onEmbed
Uno is for the money, deuce is for the show
Trey is for the video, what the fuck is fo'?
Fo' is for the hoes, and 5 to stay alive
That shoulda been number 1, cause I don't wanna die
Add 6 when I begin to flip the big Benz
With the candy-coated paint, plus the 20" rims
And what they hittin fo', I roll 7 out the do'
Took his bankroll, plus his diamond and his gold
8: 'Don't be late' is for my niggas paper-chasin
Got Nines for trick niggas in the game player-hatin
10's is for my niggas locked down in the pen
And my niggas dead and gone, until we meet again
11 is for my poppy up in heaven
Tell God send me a blessing, cause I'm down here stressin
12 is for the records we sell, we're goin platinum
There's no turnin back now, so let's make it happen

All I ever wanted to do in my life was be a hustler
Some don't get it, but feel me when I spit it
It's all about the dollar

It goes one for the money, two for the show
Everybody in the game know how it go
It's a whole lotta hoes, a whole lotta dough
Keeps me watchin on toes out my back window
Creep slow by the ghetto, we never go without the .44
For urban travel, watch the scandal
You petty rivals can't handle
Hit your block, increase props as we dismantle
Channel my vengeance through this sentence, I'm relentless
You bitches wanna spend this, but get pimped
We're never said to beat any listener senseless
Heavyweighters livin major, pumpin this here, no circumference
Who is this? O.C. The Sinister
Navigatin, now we're raidin all over your area
I'm darin ya to static with this Rap-A-Lot shit
The Camorra make hits, tag licks, like movin bricks
The lyricist full of canabis, livin extravagant
With elegant bitches, plottin riches
On quick-to-get-rich niggas full of liquor
C'll shine one time livin bigger

Them niggas playa-hatin, what the fuck they wanna do?
I want peace, but if them niggas want beef
We gon' have to take the heat to the streets
Knawmean? They tryin to stop dreams and block creams
It seems like what? They hate to see us havin lavish things
Pictures in magazines, nice cars and diamond rings
Ah-ah, ah-ah, we can't have no fake niggas on our team
Now you watch my back, nigga, and I watch yours
One's for the dough, two's for the shows, hoes, and tours

Hey man, niggas tryin' to stir up shit between amongst us
And Chicago man, what you think about this shit?
Ah, between us and the Snypaz?
Man I'm talkin about us and every muh-fuckin body, man
Ah but you know we too tight up in Chicago
We got love worldwide baby don't stop, north, south, east and west
That's right, know what I'm saying, straight up comin to you
Snypaz and Do or Die, Rap-A-Lot mafia
From the Chi, here it go like this

I went from zip locks and bakin soda
To smokin herb, cookin 'ola
Never lookin overnight success
Cause I want a Rover
Hold you head up and stick yo chest out
And if you heavy off in this game then get yo vest out
I hit the scence like po-po's
In the four door Chevrolet, we gas
With hats broke off to the left
To show you exactly where you at
I want the scratch that you done say
Remember, bust a cap a lot
For the rooftop Snypaz snap a lot
Puttin down with Rap-A-Lot
You'll die, can't fuck with us
So when you say it, you'll a lie
You'll try and get shut down
From Texas all the way back to Chi

Try to let go of my negative
Only got one life to live
It's fucked up, only had one chance
And now I'm takin it
See niggas fakin it
If a nigga ain't real then his ass ain't makin it

Overnight, I had to do more than hold the mike
Had to control the fight
Had to make sure my dough was right
Had to make sure my boys was tight
Noise and lights, stalkin from the end of my (?) gonna spook ya
Horror type of tactics, you bet the Snypaz (?) knew ya
Stressed out, had me feelin left out
Stuck and I gotta get my self out
But when I was kid then crept out
Fuck all the ones who never helped out
Stepped out with grams and plans to be an overnight achiever
Since (....?....) to non-believers, overnight
 X 2
You can do what you wanna do
But it ain't gonna happen for you
Not overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight

Livin it up, this ain't no overnight shit
See (?) got a death wish
But Do or Die and Snypaz, represent Chi-Town
Took a life and get lit up quick
Rain niggas got me doin this
Used to be on some sell ass shit
Or mail that bitch back home in a box
And leave no trail of this
Now won't witness this and this is
How's it's gonna fall
All of y'all gonna battle
Leave this life, all shells gon drop tonight
You say that you want a spot
Better they hit like the shit from Rap-A-Lot
So pack that Glock or AK stops your clock, my straps get hot
Even though it's hot it ain't hot enough to stop this entourage
Rain, Do or Die, pick a piece Snypaz, one big mob
Better stop that heart
Beuregard this industry from backyards to owin Lexus cars
So flex that shit cause down in Texas, everybody talks
Cause ain't gonna fall, overnight
I got an american dream of gettin out the ghetto
Runnin out they mails
About the loved ones that said they love me, but didn't care
Do Roc scare? With the fuckin niggas who groundin me
It's Roc on the block, 45 Glock cocked
Finna pop these niggas and they drop
I'm screamin more and more and more war
Killa for scrilla and more war, more war (more war)
I'm screamin more and more and more war
Killa for scrilla and more war, more war (more war)

A to the muthafuckin K
Runnin through the gateway bustin at the niggas back
Uh, Ooo wee, whip a, nigga, wit his, own gat
Oh snap, you in the business, dump him in the tar
Point blank range, nigga I'm game, do anything
(..?..) , (..?..), hangin out the window
Me and my comrades take a nigga out his shoes
Rule number one, don't get it confused
I'm talkin bout that one three, s-h-o-t
Nine millimeter kill 'em off of me
Make 'em freeze
Kill for my nigga that'll kill for me
Infa, red, lights and bombs leave a bitch, a nigga his arms
Stay alarmed, Vietnam, when I closed caskets
Pimp, lyrical tactics, shit look hectic
When I bomb a bad bitch
1997 niggas, and you can't do it overnight

(Bring it back)
I bring it back with all my old school game
No matter how you hate the OG, you can't change him
See, cause to me it's total disrespect
For motherfuckers who done lived in the ghetto
Turn around and talk they shit
And try to downgrade the next dude tryin
To get up out the ghetto like you
But you straight fried him
See, now what you niggas need is open eyes
Although you made yourself a couple a million, you keep an open mind
Cause down the stretch, you lose your grips on reality
And he who grips, slip on life fades fatality
I seen the same shit you seen in the 70's
And you can blame shit on me, but nigga never
Beat the flow of a youngster, raised up amongsta
Niggas who ain't bullshit with life, they straight stuck ya
Now how the fuck am I supposed to change
A place that since my mother been born it ain't been known to change
And all my niggas can relate to what I bring to 'em
Instead of turnin my back, I sing to 'em
 X 4
Jockin my homies?
Ride for my homies, think?
Cause I'll die for my homies

Dedicated to my homies who been trapped in the jail
Since these other motherfuckers seem to lost they respect
For the place, niggas got game on how to handle these streets
Instead of layin dead, you get knocked down you stand on your feet
If I ain't learn nothing else, I learned to struggle and strive
Cause the ghetto made a man out a nigga, I can't lie
But every black community done seen the same thing
Somebody come up out the hood and make a strange change
Ain't no forgettin where it started for me
The hustle out the hood never departed from me
No matter how many niggas try to change my story
Can't nobody make me go change my story
So motherfuckers claimin that they represent life
Make sure them hoes is representin it right
Talk to me
 X 4
Now break it down to the beat one time
(vocal breakdown)
Talk to me now

How dare you so called black politicians
Knock me for the game that I explain to my listeners
See, they wanna put me on remote control
So they can turn me on and off when they feel it
And try to take control
But I refuse to cooperate
You take away the plug out the game it ain't gon operate
So now we're picky with the wickedly ways
And I done been inside the beast in his belly for six days
Cause they solutions is institutionalize
All the game made millionaires would choose to survive
Instead of fallin dead, we bounce to these beats
But you look at my music like an ounce on these streets
I send this out to every street in your city with blacks on em
Since every motherfucker got paid to turn they backs on em
I got more love for the ghetto than that
And every time I step my ass out the hood, I go back
So you can miss me with that bullshit you stressin
I keep it real with my niggas with no question
So while you're teachin em that shit they can fake to
I teach em shit that they can relate to
My homies

You wonder why
I hang with these thugs
Whut

Since I was little I been hangin' with these Niggas
And till I die I gon remain with these Niggas
St. Paul in
The M-P-L-S, I hear you callin'
I put it down yes
Now Chris Rock were you at
I heard you say some shit about some blacks
Nigga, this been your ass back
Come see the real deal
Stay in the fields Nigga
These Niggas will kill
This ain't no cap-gun shots, Nigga
This a Glock, pah, pah
It's death on your block
Knock, knock
Whut's up Nigga?
These sirenes start singing
It's me and Yuk with the L-G in the makin'
It's stinkin', freakin'
Bowlin' on the weekend
Creepin, seekin'

And I bring the B-O-M-B-?

And make that Nigga bug, Nigga
It's In My Blood
Niggas like me turn Niggas like you into hustelers
Fuckin wit us, fuckin wit us!
Verse 2:
It's in my veins
Like a chain-reaction
How it all happened
Paps is slangin' crack in the mid 80's
Back in the day when shit was crackin'
Niggas pay 38 for a package
Tightly rappin'
For shippin' and handelin' taxes was added
That's where the A-raps headin'
Even when I sleep they in cavage
Lavage shit
Do automatics with scopes under my mattress
With the dope and the drugmoney
Stuffin' that shit up under the rugmoney
Thug hungry
Takin' drugs only cause we love money
I'm a Nigga, he's a Nigga
Would you like to be a Nigga too
Makin' big scrilla like these Niggas do
You probably be a drugdealer too
Scan and tuned in to the boys in blue
Listen for clues
In the kitchen bakin up Peruvian flake
It takes
28 grams
Multiplied by 36 zips to make
A triple beam brake, a triple beam shake
A hundred grams on the triple beam flake
2.2 pounds to be straight
My Niggas just flew in from GA
Ready to buy 4 kilos
Then drive slow back to Youngstown Ohio
So fuck these rhymes
Let me stick my dick in your ear
And fuck with your mind
Nigga
Chorus
Verse 3:
Niggas betray themselves as low key
Broken down and fabricated
Easily ejaculated, table with and half way faded
Ain't no wars cause they made it
That type of bullshit is outdated
But I played it like I laid it
My partners have always said that
It was set me up
For life
Money, clothes and hoes but road I chose was
Nothin' nice
Niggas know just what it's like to be hustelers
Governors from strugglers
Bitches lovin' us
Blindly chasin' that life we lust
I blush
Bottles, havin' thoughts and iring dreams
Goin' down and roll fast
Tryin' to get what my eyes have seen
Fried of me, huh
Nigga for a hand that got me through these eyes right to see
But part not I was blind to the point
Not even I could see, or that I could be
Obviously
I wasn't meant for me this type of trickery
Hit me with the type of mystery
Lay it down like history
With the intend of be myself and I
Street desire, easila
Piece of mind, I was least to find
Some sassiness
Hossisiless it gets to shit and praise to the farmer innercist
Nobody was meant for it, it was deadly
And I was discontent
With the shit that life once sent
Government depend, now most of my time is spent
Escapin' what I love
It's in my blood
Chorus x2Embed

I know I shouldn't do this
But I can't help it
I'm a fiend
Lotion and magazines is what I'm left wit
I step witout my pride
To the toilet
And laced my palm wit honey and almond
But suddenly the phone rings
And it's K.B
Pussy just came through
Some for him and some for me
Hell yeah, I'll be there to help you fuck 'em
Get 'em drunk, get 'em high
Pull they titties out and suck 'em

Don't rush 'em
We 'bout to fuck these hoes, man, no question
Just bring yo' ass on
Because they already buzzin'
And lovin'
My hospitality, I put it down
I got a quarter pound o' weed
And a big thing o' Crown
Shit, my dick hard now

Wit these big soft asses and these nice round titties
While you gigglin'

But still I got 'em under control
Impatiently, waitin' for some dick that's swole
They just some horny ass bitches that love to fuck
Tellin' me how they suck dick and swallow the nut
(They gobble it up?)
I thought I told ya 'bout one of these hoes
That put my foot inside her pussy
Then took it out and sucked my toes
Yo, don't forget to stop and get some fuckin' Dunk 'ems
(What?) Condoms, you forget dem nigga we got a problem
[Devin}
That ain't no problem, man
You know we must cover our bones
Zoom zoom bust in the room
Get 'bout two and I'm gone
And as soon as I get there
I'm gonna spit some game to her
Get the pussy so quick
You think I already knew her
We 'bout to fuck these hoes


Finally, at last, Devin showed up
And the first thing this muthafucka said was

What the fuck is this thick neck big bitch here
Man I shoulda bought a 16 ounce beer
Say big hoss you fucked over me dog

How in the hell we gonna get

Stop trippin' and just take ya clothes off
'Cuz all pussy feel the same when the lights go off

Man that's too much ??
For just one fuck
And I'll pass
You can't even tell the difference
'Tween they stomach and they ass
Stretch marks on they titties like a road map
Ho slapped on some Maybeline

But she keep her navel clean
And at least these hoes big and cute
Not big and fucked up
You den fucked a skinny, ugly ass ho
So nigga what's up
Who give a fuck if you fuck these broads
Nobody knows
So just drank and smoke this dank
And let's fuck these hoes

Show 'em what they pussy made for (2X)Embed
I read the book of Revelations
And now I realize we in revelations
And on that note, I make this statement
For all the young guns to become one to die young
Because the world is filled with hatred
And they aim to blame our sons
And I've done seen down the barrel of a strap before
But I don't wanna die no mo', I fear the reaper
Help us, Jesus, help to keep us away from all the sadness
And deliver us from the hate that 'cause the madness
I'm glad it's installed in me from day one
Believe in something because most of my homies believe in nothing
And paying for it, God bless your souls, I'll be praying for it
Eventually, you'll have your day in court
And I done been a witness to homicide
Seen a whole family die
Before the stones of diamonds in the sky
Through my bloodshot eyes feel the hurt and all the hate
That I've trapped inside because the hurtin' hard to ache
There's a smile on my face
But, that's to keep a man from crying
'Cause deep down inside, I know I'm dying
I'm born for it, gon' take some time to gettin' used to
And Satan I know that your listening but I rebuke you
And refuse to let you capture me and kill my will
Just to survive the game of life, win or lose
Do or die, refuse to let you capture me to kill my will
To survive the game of life, win or lose, do or die

Open my hands like a book
Years and years me and my notebook
I take a close look
Peep it dread see myself failing
A felon on the verge of 1-8-7
But I ain't ever wanna do it
'Cause homicide never solved it
Just momentarily resolved it
We've all been involved in the calling of a loved one
Oldest ones the young ones the smartest one the dum-dums
And not begun with some
And they all probably died with none by the gun
That's on the one, two, three and the fo's for life
I slap five on the black hand side
I realize the future lies among my two sons and daughter
So I pray to God just for tomorrow
In lieu of the drama, I move my momma
But the poverty's prolonging the pain
Plugging my arteries and veins with strains
When I lose in this game
Whether we win or lose this life to do or die
But sometimes we lose the will to win and wonder why
Whether we win or lose this life to do or die
But sometimes we lose the will to win and wonder why

12/11/73, a young little huster was born
Torn from my momma's womb in the midst of the storm
Never warned I was going through a world of stress
Never knew that I was born for death, may God bless
My pops died when I was thirteen, I'm still tripping
Forget living, I'm on a suicidal mission
Tears dripping from my eyes as I look up at the sky
Asked the higher power why my old man had to die
It was hard to say goodbye I tried to hide what I feel
Forget the wife forget the will (naw, chill; naw, chill)
I'm at your gravesite, late night trying to figure out
Would I see your smiling face if I commence to dig you out
I'm all about the cheese, I plan to see you once again
But I can't make through the night without committing a sin
I had to realize there wasn't no friends, backstabbin'
I had to watch my own back while I was out mashin'
Closed caption for the hearing impaired
Have you ever seen your closest homey laid out buried and dead?
I shed a tear even though I'm not supposed to cry
I can't lie I ain't ready to die, I ain't ready
Whether we win or lose this life to do or die
But sometimes we lose the will to win and wonder why
Whether we win or lose this life to do or die
But sometimes we lose the will to win and wonder whyEmbed
Now the funeral is over, and all the tears are dried up
Niggas hangin' deep on the cut gettin' fired up
Lookin' for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your motherfuckin' killer
I want you to witness your motherfuckin' murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill then your ass has gots to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep
You sho' nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
'Cause where I come from yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rollin' through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house and now your sister's life's in danger (By a total stranger)
With a gang of, niggas wantin' to bang you
And hang you, stain you, with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holloway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standin' up for our own shit
And if you outside the clique then you die, bitch (Quick)
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother, uh
Because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what O.G. say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm lookin' at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pawn cocked
Ready to lick shots nonstop until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
'Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you motherfuckers know who run it, uh
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize something nigga (You fuckin' with the very best)
I got this killa up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary
I'm goin' off on the deep end
I found myself face-to-face with myself while I'm sleepin'
I see your picture in my head and my hands shake
You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this motherfucker fore he gets to me
So in your own blood, you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this motherfucker in his fuckin' grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die, they'll be no tears in the end

I ain't the one who pushin' buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me

One wrong move, and I'ma have to leave you for the goons
Catch you slippin' asleep in your bedroom and then (*Explosion*)
Get you outtie, now what the fuck was this dude thinkin'
You can cheat the rules of the streets and not leave stinkin'?

I can squeeze without blinkin', I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (Ooh), I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta, right?

I got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
But the whole while I'm cookin', I'm like, "Fuck this dude"
It's on, thirty-six zones of my own
Keep the money for myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone (Ayy), "I just got knocked
And the cops was askin' 'bout you, come get me hot"
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin' on the dope
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin' over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block
And if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with 'em
Dummy move, whole thing, the goon squad get 'em

I can squeeze without blinkin', I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (Ooh), I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta, right?
No more petty rock hustlin', I'm in for the run
And I'm for sure I'm gon' be murdered for this shit that I done
But I'ma die standin' up, 'cause I'm a stand-up nigga
Fuck dyin' like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry 'cause I was destined to get it
Just remember, I'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
And pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein' first motherfuckin' light of the day
A trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality with a fuck you mentality
Silencin' all these niggas in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin' from they loved one's fatality
He ain't got a reason to die then kill him, it's a tragedy

I can squeeze without blinkin', I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (Ooh), I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta, right?

This song is about a nigga always trying to keep you down you know
Now touch that

We made something from nothing
And vowed to never tear it apart
We turned the street hustle into an art
That would quickly change life forever for us
No more riding bikes or catching the bus
We on the roll up, money to fold up
With Cognac and cooked yola
Got the neighborhood about to blow up, but hold up
I see this van sittin', this old cat in a fitted
Trying to get your little homey tore up
Yo bruh, we ain't working on this corner take your ass on, dog
Before you make me feed your ass to my hogs you fucking faggot
I know you want to catch me with this bag so you can hide me
Or with my .44 so you can 45 me
You put this shit off in our neighborhoods and sweat us
And when you finally catch us up you give us letters
A cold thing
Just when a nigga reach his goal, mayne
You hand him a case for easing out the dope game
And I'm

So what I rap about these streets
That don't make me be no less of a man
Than a person that do work with his hands
It's bad enough I gots to deal with all these pressures that stand
You tryin' to make me stray away from my plan
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm from the gutter, where all we had was one another
No wheat bread to butter, from one bed to the other
All uncles and no brother
My mother's at work
My grandfather was my dad
And when he died it hurt
And as I hold back the tears my eye-wells swell
I been praying for heaven, I been living in hell
And these niggas in my age group is dead or either locked up
The bitches no better, they smoked out or knocked up
But I still love my hood, that's where it started
Ain't no hard feelings, we partners nigga, regardless
That's why you always see me coming around
Cause I could never turn my back on my town
But still I'm
Watching us unfold with the times
He don't really want a nigga to climb

You'd rather separate me from my family forever

You motherfuckers would rather keep me down

Money never changed me
Money changed the people around
Now they plot to try to keep me down
But still I rise like yeast
Your whole conversation bout B
Fuck a nigga talking bout me, I'm a G
The realest motherfucker ever done it
You can't continue to pimp me and y'all eat from it
So fuck every soul who ever felt like I owed
Them a god damn dime, or a god damn rhyme or a god damn chance
Motherfucker you sad
You a grown ass man, holding a nigga hand
Now get out on your own, stop depending on your homes
To chuck you a bone, and stop throwing stones
And that goes for everybody thinking it's them
Fuck you, you and you
Her, him and him
Tom, Dick and Kim
All of y'all stand accused
Saying fuck to me
And I done bought your children's shoes

I'mma low key, OG, from OZ's, to whole ki's

Hit the neighborhood, let's get it on, boy
Let's throw a barbeque, or we can blow dank
If you don't smoke weed, then we can have dranks
'Cause y'all the homeboys, that kept the man fed

There's gonna be some shit you might not understand but, you may have to rewind this shit a few times. Heaven, heaven. Check it out

I know tomorrow ain't a promise, that's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there'll be no crying
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punching the clock
No need for screaming at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My own homeboy was robbing me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is scheming?
And every other corner, you're passing a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm remembering this
Your family's your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was saying, "Back in the days"
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's saying

My angel, my sunshine
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend, my good time
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl

Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, this shit's ain't no song
I'm hearing niggas makin' up scriptures, and playing along
Probably saying I'm the hypocrite, for judging these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everybody, hoping that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shooting outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Gon' change your life when you hear it
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feeling first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life and it was like
Heaven, but I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't working
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And trying and get to heaven

America the Beautiful, don't be so cold
How do you expecting our seeds gonna grow?
When you trap us in the ghetto
And show love, to the other motherfuckers
While we right here starvin' at home
I'd cry, if I thought, that me sheddin' a tear might help
Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself, we all sinners
Facin' the winter, with no socks, and no shoes
In a position, where we all gon' loose
Instead of penitentiaries, we gon' need more schools
Or what the fuck is we gonna do?
Sit around and let the world pass us by?
Waitin' on a message from the reverend
And he ain't but another man, tryin' to get to heaven1Embed
Turn up your radios

You're down and out, money funny, you hustle and die
On the verge of pawnin your jewelry and sellin your ride
Somebody shoulda told him ain't no life in these streets
You only out here 'til you touch it, when you touch it you eat
Niggas done took too many chances shovelin snow
And ended up facin a lifetime for tryin to sco'
I'm givin livin definitions on the subject of dope
One week he back on his feet, the next he's WHOA
I was a 70's baby, raised in the 80's
I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember in the 80's, me and pop would ride
Now we conversate on acres we's about to buy
He had already been what I'm about to go through
Told me ain't no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
If you made twelve dollars, you put seven away
And lived off the five, and never ever fuck with your safe
But when

When he hustle and he robbin'
That's when niggas start plottin'
And when you niggas start plottin'
Us country niggas start mobbin', mobbin'

Gettin back was out of the question, they lived for today

To set up, they fuckin homeboy to get what he got
I mean the ones he broke the bread with, the ones you don't want
To be the ones fuckin your girlfriend the moment you out
I know the street game backwards, forwards, sideways
It used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
It's cutthroat, that's fucked up, niggas want they come up
So bad they'll take the .357 and smoke they brother
A damn shame; but, that's the way the game go
A chance niggas is takin especially if they slang dope
I've been in that position, back in the day
In fear of my homie hittin' my head to crack in my safe
And that's when

When ya hustle ain't evolvin
That's when niggas start starvin
And when you niggas start starvin
That's when you niggas start robbin (when these niggas start robbin)
When these niggas got problems
That's when niggas start plottin
And when you niggas start plottin
Us country niggas start mobbin - mobbin
So listen up my niggas, and I ain't tryin to preach
I'm just tellin it from my side 'cause I'm in the streets
I done been there, done that, seen a whole neighborhood
Destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
He caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
He get his own fuckin people jammed and he take the five
That's the shit there; they ain't even catch him with dope
But they gave him thirty-five years 'cause the nigga done spoke
Snitchin, that's a motherfucker, watch what you say
You don't know no-motherfuckin-body, nigga, you lame
Watch your so-called homeboys, keep to yourself
Stay away from niggas gettin caught that get out of jail
Don't talk about your business, keep yo' thoughts in yo' head
And this game it got a paper trail, watch where ya spend
Don't write down names and numbers, it's a memory thing
Never shit where ya sleep, keep the crib out of range
And plus you never let these niggas know where you stay
'Cause when the push turns to a shove, they hittin your safe
True motherfuckin' game, true motherfuckin' game

When ya hustle ain't evolvin'

It's been a long time coming but now I'm back at it
Flipping the script, from balling back to gangsta rap classics
You know that shit that hit the hood and upset it
If real niggas respect it, the squares gon' rep it
I done came in here to bring it to you
The uncut version of ganstarism with the nickel painted Ruger
Quick to cock it on you, spark light in your eyes
The unexpected is happening to you now nigga, surprise!
Who is it? (Face, marchin', mobbin')
You said it one more time (Face Mob)
What else? (we keep you)
Now motherfuckers lay it down
The ruler's back, cause it's too many pussies out here
Making bullshit records and ruining rap
I gotta check this whole game; niggas out here listening
To these record label bitches instead of doing they thing
I'm a real nigga, a street nigga till it's done with
And I could never let you talk me into dumb shit
Like selling out to move a few more units
Just keep me in the ghetto cause the hood stay truest
You fuck around and cross the other side of the track
Catch you a brick then realize that you can't come back
I'mma stick to the facts
Fuck it if I don't go two
The homies know that Face stay true
And though I've got more muscle, my sounds don't change
Been the same ever since I stepped in the game
Now, this is for these niggas switchin' they shit

You the king on your block, but you ain't shit in DC
You ain't shit off in the city of Chi
You ain't shit off in the Do It or Die
They want to skin you alive
Out here talking like you carrying arms
We don't shoot at motherfuckers, we done flipped the script to carrying bombs
I can end it for niggas out here who's hard in the booth
Any city I can hit the hood cause Scar is the truth
I know so much about these streets that I can walk them asleep
You can't tell me shit about your hood, I walked on your beat
I know your whole life story, plus I've seen for myself
You got caught smoking dope, that's why they sent you to jail
Had you locked up with wet backs, only real niggas suffer set backs
90 days and I ain't goin' to respect that
And you can sniff a snitch a mile away
Fuck him in his ass and feed him dick, a pound a day

I've got niggas I was raised with who know who I am
Lil' Brad from out of South Acres, prone for scams
Never ducked the motherfucker, I was down for the dirt
Got respect from older cats cause I was down for the work
When Fondren had its Great Skate I'd roll to the club
Drunk off the bird with thumbtack holes in my glove
Stood in the corner waiting for bullshit to jump
And in the event it jumped you saw a fool get stomped
There it is, can't get this shit no realer than that
Had a super boxing game, but now I'm peeling your cap
I done been in fist fights with niggas twice my size
Got an incredible record, 27 and 5
And the 5 losses I got, I had to redeem 'em
So he had to fight me everytime I seen him
Ain't no pussy in me, I've been for real before this rap shit
I study MCs, that's how I know you hoes is plastic
So-a, shake your ass and I'mma tell 'em the truth
Fabricate your bumps and bruises homey, do what you do
Just remember who for real when they tell you they real
I survived the game of life nigga, fuck some skills

What can I do?
What can I do, to make it better?
Yeah, yeah

I thank the Lord, for every morning, he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining, there's a cloud in the sky
Lettin' me know, that at any moment, there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is, there still can be pain
Down the park, I hear the sirens, just a screamin' away
And then the inevitable happens, the end of them days
As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away)
I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash, it reminds me of the now and the past
I say me a prayer, cause eventually I'll stand in the path
Of the souls and dark roads that lead to rest

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone like you and me)
Take away their fears

And then a child is born
Bloody naked, clingin' to life
Unaware of his surroundings or if breathin' is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time, another mother, murders her kids
And the unbearable thought of this here just brings me to tears
It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls
And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself
But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I couldn't help
All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds ‘cause dealin’ with that
Would be the hardest thing, I’d ever have to do in my time
I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't climb
The stairway that you hear me singin' bout in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time
I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die
But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky
Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did, before you had to go

I say goodbye to you cruel world, I see peace in the red sky
I see the beast when the dead die, relief when my head’s high
Hear the streets up ahead cry, when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye, 'fore the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table, the tale of the tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John Doe’s that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb, but I’m cool, I’m cool
(Kelly Price)

Funky bitch, fake ass bitch!"

Hey, today must be my lucky day
I turned the corner, hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away
(now where's she staying?) she must be new in the hood
But I ain't trippin' on that shit, cause it's all good
I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name
Ain't a damn thing changed, ain't no shame in my game
She said, " Used to go Thomas"
I slowed my roll, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas
Now where your man at, she said "Gone at work"
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinkin', "Go on and flirt"
My homies women ain't no thing to me
Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me
And furthermore, she was peepin' my ride
Convertible, 64, with the ride inside
Super clean with the discs and vogues
Higher than a fuck spittin' this to hoes:
You might also like
Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight

Reminiscing on the bitch that I had back in the day
Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face
Now that's the breaks
She didn't have to put up a front
I stuck that ass back in there
And haven't called her for 3 months
I guess it's in me to be doggin' a chic
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master
Let her take a ride with the Bradster
It cool, don't front ..ooooh, no sex
No sweat-not even on my mind-we just met
And furthermore, we can get to those
But for now, I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to hoes:

Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight
Now I'm cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped
Parked my Ferrari, now I'm back in the coup
I knocked her boots - your baby's mama put me to work
I tagged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt
She wanted me badly so I put it inside
She got the (front, back, and side to side)
Back and forth with the gangster glide
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9
Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the Knicks
Now she's asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick
(now that's sick) and plus she got you staying at home
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on
So believe me when you downin' the Brad
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass
So player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose
I'll be mobbing in my 'Benz spitting this to ho's:

Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can roll and see the sights
It's going down tonight2Embed

(Some motherfuckin' G's)

Roamin' in my motherfuckin' hood and thangs
Seems to me my motherfuckin' hood done changed
'Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs
But now we gots to deal with them survival thangs
.45 in my lap when I'm on the creep
Niggas livin' shife, so I roll one deep
'Cause now they see me flippin' in the 1-9-9-4
C.S.I. nigga, black 850
And now they lookin' at me crazy
But off-brand niggas can suck a dick because they can't fade me
And if it came down to the gun, black
I never cracked up under pressure, 'cause I was trained for combat
So get yo' motherfuckin' boys together
I represent S.A., nigga, and we makin' noise forever
And gettin' paid at the same time
So you respect a motherfucker when a motherfucker claim mine
'Cause if you disrespect, you ass out
And they we rollin' through yo' mothafuckin' shit in the Glasshouse
Actin' bad with the flashers on
Makin' niggas get they asses on
'Cause ain't no motherfuckin' love for fools
Who come around this motherfucker tryin' to scrub, you fool
It ain't no haps on it, hops, we snaps on the cops
And straps on the Glocks
And take the law into our own hands
'Cause you ain't fuckin' with a rookie, nigga, you fuckin' with a grown man
And we gon' show you what we mean by funk
Muthafucka, you ain't see my trunk
I got a (SK) and a (AK)
And a (12 gauge) that'll fuck a nigga whole day
So recognize a real nigga from the streets

Hollerin' at my homie at the Swisher House
Scored a 40 bag and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park and got up under the tree
Pull the Swishers out and gave the ganja to Creep
Wrapped us up a fattie and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin' cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't wanna see it that way
But all I got to say is, "You don't wanna see that S.A.​"
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin' don't make us no difference
And dyin' don't make it no different
'Cause I done been to mo' wakes in this past year
Than the motherfuckin' Bengals lost last year
So ain't no motherfuckin' thang for me
To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me
Now when you're rollin' through your motherfuckin' hood (Guess what I see?)

Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scopin', hopin' for you to fuck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit
(It ain't no motherfuckin' peace when they see me)
'Cause we never had a motherfuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get 'em with game
And when I hit 'em with the game I gotta hit 'em with this damn thang
'Cause it's kill or be killed, never cut slack
And if you cut slack, they bust back, fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
'Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one
And that's the one that can close the shop
So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
'Cause in my motherfuckin' hood, that's how it be

I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

I wanna walk with you, follow in your footsteps
Talk with you to find out where my goods kept
I been gone away from home for so long
Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong
I'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my faith
So I'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
See, I'm a sinner in the third degree
Ain't afraid to admit it, 'cause I seen niggas worse than me
Who am I to judge a man when I'm a man myself
In the dark, trying to get me some help?
I went from pawn to king, king back to pawn
Doing my best to try to ease out the storm
I know that every tunnel's got an end and a light
And I prepared a new beginning in Christ
My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
And as I'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine

It seems like every other Wednesday I'm attending a wake
But I don't question you, I know that's your way, okay
I know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
We've got to leave here, 'cause that's your design
And nothing lasts forever, not even spirit, only your word
That's what I live by, 'cause that's what I heard
I wasn't there when you rose from the dead or you parted the sea
I never seen you, but still I believe
How you explain the moon, the sky, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea, the earth without form facing the deep?
In darkness challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds, to make up the trees
So why we turn our backs on the truth?
It's Heaven or Hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth
And I was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit
So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it
I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

Lord, I know that I've been wrong
They say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song
So I'm singing on my knees 'cause I believe you'll keep me strong
Until it's time for me to bring it home
But until it's time for me to bring it home
I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray, 'cause when I pray it's understood
That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself
I need the Heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to God 'cause God towers
Over all, and in that I save this prayer
For all my homies that's been trapped out there
That's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days
So fuck what they say, 'cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about
I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

"In world news today: officials agree that rapper Brad Jordan, alias
Scarface, must be stopped. After being monitored by Secret Service agents for two years, evidence leads Tobacco and Firearms officials to believe that his literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution,degrade women, influence gambling, promote and teach violence. And more importantly it's influencing our minors and destroying our young community. Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be stopped."

We got this ho muthafucka on a mission
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they calling on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me
Gangsta Nip, Spice-1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you trying kick some dust up
America's been always known for blaming us niggas for they fuck-ups
And we were always considered evil
Now they trying to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Lets peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled
So why you criticize me
For the shit that you see on your tv
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body

Shot in the face by a cop, close casket
An open and shut situation
Cop gets got, the wanna blame it on my occupation
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me
Because the shit that I be saying ain't worse than no western movie
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti

Dropped in the middle of the floor and he ain't breathin'
And the nigga's on the go 'cause we ain't seen him

Alright cat daddy, take it easy baby

He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly, but glad to be the man's child
The world is different since he's seen it last
Out of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young, plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's callin' up his homie who done came up
Livin' lavish, now they dealin' with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth land
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now it's different, he done did dirt
And realized killin' men meant comin' up but it still hurt
And can't nobody change this
It's 1994 and we up against the same shit

Everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for souls, then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for your final test
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longer will it be 'til it's all done?
Total darkness at ease be at all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life, but your memory you'll never take
You'll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face

I still gotta wonder why
I never seen a man cry 'til I seen a man die

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dyin' so you hold on
And you keep on blackin' out and your pulse is low
Stop tryin' to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go
Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try
And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you're still feelin' outta place
So you standin' in the tunnel of eternal life
And you see the ones you never learned to love in life
Make the choice, let it go if you can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free
Here lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace
I still got to wonder why
I never seen a man cry 'til I seen that man die10Embed

Deep in the mind of the wide opens
Right here we stand alive, we lie focused
We open-minded, still we die hopeless
With our pride broken and bullet holes cover where we stay at
And everybody's playing for keeps, most people pray that
We all make it up out this godforsaken place
That we've been all faced with
We take our chances but they all wasted
And once again you see me (marching, mobbing)
But how long must I continue to see my homies dodgin' these marksmen
The whole nine put on the line but never in mind to become the head sergeant
We all targets
The votes are in, but they ain't ours
We got these politicians running they game to regain power
While our whole black community sours
Crime rate towers, plagued by white powders
And they claim to helping us to clean up our community
But ain't no open opportunities, immunity
Is what these demons use to regulate
We keep in mind we can run but we can't hide 'cause the streets we walk are never safe
Still all my shattered hopes and dreams remain scattered
Broken into thousands of pieces, smashed and battered
But it don't matter, hypocrisy in your democracy
Is stopping me, so I'm retaliating properly
Theologically, society has got me pressured by the hate
And Heaven knows I have faith, I have faith

Rudely awaken from this bad dream
Thinking my conscience wants to tell me something because of these bad things
(Past things) kept me in the center of these mad dreams
(Flashing) homicidal me and fatal slashings
Now I'm asking: explain to me these visionaries Brad's seen
(Past things) sad things killed him cause he had dreams
(A sad scene) but all I ever wanted was my mind back
Now I'm that nigga trying to find out where his mind's at
The time that it took myself to figure out my mind's gone
My mind cracked, slide back, look at all the time gone
Rewind back, combat, understand my life gon' make these cuts that won't change
But things look so strange, the plague
I gots to get myself up out the frame
Try to maintain the same game flipping tennis plain Janes
A damn shame, people gots to always check your background
To jack now, come jack now and I'mma leave you flat down
Come back now or back down, homie, this is always all day
(Killer) in these dark and lonely hallways
Cause all they wanna see is all us brothers boxed up in caskets
With plastic bags in every place from getting blasted
It's drastic, mama help me calm down cause your son's sick
Don't watch me get gunned down for the dumb shit
Then the gun click and now I see the other side of black space
My last day, sad case, Heaven knows I had faith

New day brings about change, everybody's searching for the light
The daydream schemes of living lifers
Got us tossed up, believing we controlling our emotions
Got the answer in space beside the view behind the ocean
And adapting to the everyday struggle's got us stressed
Cause the fact we know we here one day and could die the next
You've insisted to take equipment to the solar system
Trying to ensure your sole existence
Now tell me: do you think that when the bang goes boom
You can pack up all your things and aim for the moon?
It's unlikely, but you might be equipped with with proceeds to save lives
But you die when the King say die
You can race it but you can't shake it, stop trying
Try to hide it, cause you can't face it but you're born dying
God, please forgive us cause we're human not perfect
And the devil try to turn us from you, but it's not working
How can we all sit suspended in space
Just spinning in place and ain't extended in faith
Man, wait -

I don't really remember feeling like this
Got this love formin' in my life-for this dame
And indeed took the form of life-and that's a shame
How a man can fall in love with dreams--not afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave

Only right we stop and give her props
Plus she from the block of only finer crops
Do your thang MaryJane

When the world starts to stress you out-what you do?
Put a cancer stick up in your mouth-or grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains is-they the blame
And the government's been taxin' that (   )-- gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke--kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks- true or not
Other people try to make you bad--but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of need-all I need
Your natural you come from seeds-I decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name

Are we on the radio Dukes?
Aww yeah, give it to me
Yeah

At night I can't sleep, I'm tossin' and turnin'
I still got the candlesticks burnin'
It ain't changed but it's a different time
And I'm still playin' tricks with my mind
My mothers always stressin' that I'm livin' wrong
But I got my Smith and Wesson 'cause I'm gettin' grown
And their lookin' at your little boys success
And I been thinkin', I'm dealin' with too much stress
So I stay up on my P's and Q's
And watch out for the G's and fools
'Cause the homies that I thought I had
See me stackin' up a grip and they just started talkin' bad
So I stay away from outsiders
And when I roll through, it makes 'em open they mouth wider

So I take it on myself to thank him one deep

I got this coffee pot of white soap
Stuck my hanger down the center
When I entered I spent it cause it was like dope
But on the real-a he was jackin' me for scratch
'Cause out of 36 ounces this motherfucker brought me 20 back
I'm slanging 20 sacs cause I done lost 16
And these goddamn streets ain't going to bring me back
Now could it be the Southside big baller
Bolo rock slanger stones done got slaughtered-damn
I'm going up on my whole thangs
And stepped on don't go runnin my clique cause it's a cold game
And all I ever wanted was some hundred stacks
I went from slangin' O-Z's to movin' hundred sacks
Gotta make my money back
'Cause I done came too far up in these goddamn streets
To get my money snatched
I'm so for real about this motherfuckin' skrill
That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin' killed
For real

"All I have in this world...balls"

I know this nigga run this game of life
So motherfuckin sheist that at night he got to sleep with lights
Cause he done come across with shit so shadey
That mutha fuckers comin with clips to locate him
Ain't no waitin and once they spot him they gon' sure waste him
And once the got him they gon' sure waste him
This ain't no mutha fuckin joke nigga it ain't worth it
And even if your mother gets in it you can't surface
It was all purpose
Just like that bullshit you was serving it was all purpose
We all chipped in nigga and we all hurting
I gots to grind just like in eighty-nine
When a niggas 25 cent pieces look just like baby dimes
I'm on the corner selling whole eights
I don't remember being this fuckin paranoid since I sold weight
I went from 50 sacs to 50 packs
And all because this motherfucker got jipped he wants to jip me back
But when I find him I'm gon' finalize
Just to let a nigga know I'm for real and down to die for mine

Game made a big shift since '86 when I started
Seems like niggas with hustle got outsmarted
'Cause now they wanna analyze they homies for scratch
Catch them when they sleeping come down and up scrap
And even though I plotted hittin' niggas for ends
I never took out straps and shot gats at friends
It was all about being for real where I was from
Where very few niggas came real but I was one
I dedicate this to my homies stuck in battle
Living life being caught up in this muthafuckin' gamble
The game made to be changed but the niggas still started
Cocaine seems to be blamed for the niggas gettin slaughtered
How many times you had your homie shot
By the same muthafucker whose gang came from your homie's block
Niggas get caught up in the paper chase
And lose respect for the game
That was honored before the cake was made

And when the smoke dies down its still a nigga left to deal wit

And any mutha fucker want pain I brought the full bottle
Now take you two of these and call me in the morning
Three times point blank range wit no warning
Nigga I'm straight killa slash for sure drama
And every mutha fucker involved gon' face trauma
Punk I ain't no mutha fucka rappin a song
You bust your caps when you rap
But I bust back at your dome bitch
And this is always all day killa
And bitches who be stressin me out I get rid of
I'm still a guerilla in these goddamn streets
Walkin up on mutha fuckers and leavin 'em sleep
Hook:
(Cause if you gonna ride then we can ride)
But 99.9 of the times you gon' die
(Die mutha fucker die mutha fucker die)
Mutha fuckers crowdin my space they gon' die
I can't believe you hoes is playin wit this
But since you mutha fuckers want drama I'm bringing the shit
I got my dime down cocked and shined
Just a homie from the hood
Had the paper still about the grind
What you thought this was nigga some studio gimmick
A mutha fucker talking that shit but couldn't spend it-shit
I come around this mutha fucker bending bees
And dare one of you hoes to come and fuck wit me
I'm real with it I'll warn you mutha fuckers again
That if you step to me wit ho shit I'm turning you in
Shocked-and shot wit five holes in your memory
And when you headed for hell you gon' remember me
The one MC who told you niggas once
And after that he gave no warning he straight dumped- punk
I got my mind all made up to go off
When bitches start to threaten my life I go off
Take a walk on the wild side
And all the coloreds go whoop whoop
When I come down in my coupe
And mutha fuckers hatin me come give it a try
But 99.9 of the times you gon' die
Wit no warning
Dealing wit the killer wit the strap out
No warning -then
All of a sudden homie blacks out
With no warning
And now your dealing with your outer body energy
All the pain you left in your life you still feel it
Everybody living must have thought it would change

Now my daddy got a problem 'cause I'm home for vacation
Strong and shy with a fucked mind, let him know what they facing
Got the doctors who done studied this, but niggas with doubt
Probably take a shrink a lifetime to figure him out (Trust me)
I seen the same thing flash change violent
And motherfuckers caught in that chain remain silent
So why you figure I've be standing here shaking
Because the devils is close to taking me but I can't face him (oooooh)
My soul is controlled by the blessings of God
Still scared to walk to first ground 'cause the devil's in charge
Somebody help the lost souls find savior
'Cause I'm standing on the cut with a Tec-9 for the hoe behavior

Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit
And slowly but surely the shit changed
From they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed

And how he set us up for failure in the first place
And why the fuck did we just settle for a birthday
You see, I'm hip to the games that you run
Like the games you run unfair, we can get no fair one
Cause we was dealt the bad hand from the jump
And we can't deal, so we jack and get drunk
And might end up locked down or six feet
But in these streets a muthafucka gots to eat
You can't sleep, cause if you're caught sleep, you gots to pay
And just like everyone left you got your day
And these days were meant for all to keep tryin
But we can't relate, so we fall and keep dyin
Open your muthafuckin eyes who your enemy
The muthafuckas dyin or the muthafuckas killin you?

You put your crack on my table
I turn my axe on my neighbor
And my back to my Savior
You had me thinkin you were almighty
But to the Almighty you're just a man that's really all tiny
The Maker will open up our minds to see
That Heaven ain't a place here on Earth, you gots to leave
And once we leave, we stand between eternal peace and eternal pain
And you the Beast shall meet eternal flame
So let it rain, wash away up all my bad things
And put some laughter in our hearts again
Now black men, stand up, let's come together as a whole race
And don't be fed up by the old days
They try to do us like the Indians, killin us like wild beast
And show more love for the Chinese
And kept us trapped up in a small room
And made decisions on our life we accepted that left us all doomed
They sabotaged and they camouflaged
But if these niggas game to crank up some shit, then I be down to ride
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start

Apart by the sight of his son's lying in the morgue
He mourned cuz now he got to deal with the fact
That his child is gone and tears can't bring him back
Turn on the T.V. and seen the unabomber

Your sure mistaken if you a ho before I turn out
Walking away I'll heat you up and leave you burnt out-nigga
I'm hard to kill cause I refuse to die
And can't no man born of woman alive kill me
I'm untouchable
Untouchable out here, baby
(I'm untouchable)
Untouchable out here, baby
(I'm unfuckable)
Untouchable out here, baby

It's danger I'm standin' in the footsteps of danger
With a loaded Mac 11 stripped with rips in the chamber
The anger I aim the barrel of the hanger
Deep into the mind of this mutha fuckin stranger
I change ya outlook on living and I leave ya
Frozen starin' into space shakin' seizuring
I told ya the southside niggas roll deep
I showed ya the northside niggas don't sleep
Ya beat I'm coming down shootin up your section
You are now witnessing the gangster shit pure perfection
I'm old school O.G. niggas know me
From slanging' eightballs uncooked to moving whole keys
Now why these niggas wanna test my skills
I'm a killa and I chastise steel
To mix and mingle with this millionaire status
And send a motherfucker to hell when he fuck with Brad-it's
The killer instinct that never left me
The southside still true to the game little lefty is back
With shit that motherfuckers can't fade
Rhyming but still you motherfuckers ain't paid
So how can one try to see the unseen
Before you step your ass to the square know one thing
It's closed curtain we leavin' motherfuckers hurtin'
It's Rap-a-Lot Mafia life we all workin'
Punk we shut you down before you get it started
You can hate it but I'm goin' get mines and that's regardless- bitch
I got these niggas boo-hooin' like hoes
Jealous of the game I obtain and I chose
To exercise to the best of my ability
It ain't no motherfuckin' kill me
I'm Untouchable
Untouchable out here, baby
(I'm untouchable)
Untouchable out here, baby

Hey
Shit
Yeah nigga, that's

This-this is some-ehm
What we gon' call this one here?
Fuck it
Let's call it-um
Some-some
Some old school Scarface freestylin
Youknowmsayin?
Yeah
Aaaaah shit!
I'm finna freestyle in this bitch
He-yeah
Huh youknowmsayin?
Check it out

I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Pushin rocks on the block, I'm never broke, mane
But now I'm up against some mo' shit
Because the five-o's done jumped in my face with some ho shit
Tried to mix a nigga up in a homicide
Said I shot a muthafucka in his mama's ride
I ain't the nigga in the trench coat
I don't push rocks on the block, I deal the big dope
I ain't the nigga on the mic that done said he quit
But I be damned if I get popped for some petty shit
That's why I move the real chickens
So if I'm goin down, I'm comin home on a meal ticket
'Cause in this game you can't bar shit
Do your dirt on the cool, so they can't say they saw shit
So when them muthafuckas step up with that he-say
You can tell em hoes to hit the freeway
'Cause I ain't touchin shit with my own hands
I leave the dirt to be done by the next man
And count my money when they push it off
I wonder if the dope game is still bein good to y'all
'Cause in the past four years, yo
I done clocked more cash sellin dope than them white folks
That's the reason why they upset
And always tryin to mix a nigga up in some fuck shit
But I'm a killer comin atcha

Ha-ha-ha

I'm in the South Park, peepin out the territory
Finna set up shop just like in every story
So I'm rentin out the backside
And let them niggas do they work, and me, I'm kickin back, right?
And layin low in the next section
Got a fully automatic M-11 for my protection
Everything is goin smooth as planned
I gots to try to fool the man
'Cause if I'm caught, I'm doin 10 flat
So I'm gettin it while the gettin's good, nigga, fuck that
'Cause if I fall short, nigga, then I'm ass out
And then we'll see what the judge try to pass out
I see some niggas we competin with
It's goin down tonight in the village, and I can see this shit
So I'm on the telephone callin up the squad
"Get your shit together, nigga, we finna mob"
Before I hung up the phone, niggas was lettin loose
I grabbed my shit and tried to find my bullet-proof
But fuck it, niggas, ain't goin for the chit-chat
They startin off with a headshot
So if I gotta die, then I gotta die, nigga
And when I fall on my ass, don't ask me why, nigga
It was just my time and the man came to get me
Fuck it, plus a bullet hit me
A straight niggaroe subtractor
Mr. Scarface Part III, muthafucka, The Final Chapter
The final chapter for real
(All I have in this world..)
Yep
He-he
I gotta - ehm
Shit, I guess I better talk about a broad then, huh?
Before I close this muthafucka off, right?
Check it out

Later on, all alone, sat around the house layin low
Waitin for these niggas to jump so I can buck a ho
And just like I expected
A bitch came by in a G wantin to get naked
Now shit's gettin hectic
The situation's lookin grim, so yo, I gots to check it
Clean those traps, all the other shit
I'm fuckin one ho, and in comes another bitch
So now I'm jackbonin two hoes
Who's the nigga in the Kamurshol? Fuck, nigga, who knows?
She musta knew the bitch that I was fuckin with
And plus I'm strapped and she was suckin dick
Up and down with a smooth stroke
Takin 9 inches of this dick like a deep throat
The other bitch was involved in masturbation
Oh shit, now I'm ejaculatin
I let loose and they was fightin for the white shit
I got a rubber tryin to make my pipe fit
I finally made the cock crack
The bitch pulled a .330 and shoved it up my back
Then some niggas came out with a chainsaw
And tried to hack my muthafuckin brains off
These bitches set me up, y'all
Pussy: a nigga's quickest downfall
I couldn't do shit except take it like a man
But if I live, it's on again
But I wanted a quick piece
So I put down my piece and end up put down, deceased
She put the rifle to my muthafuckin head
Mr. Scarface is-naw, fuck that shit
Ah-ha-ha
Youknowmsayin?

Old McDonald had a farm
Ee-eye-ee-eye - my dick
(Is he dead?)

You can run but you can't hide, I'll find ya
Just when you think the shit is over, I'm standing right behind ya
You crossed the wrong muthafucker, now you paranoid
'Cause I'm a nigga these niggas just can't destroy
I'm on the hunt, so keep your shit low
But yo, I'm kinda slacking up, I shoulda killed you from the get-go
Nigga, but this is it
We coulda talked it out like players, but now I'm on some gangsta shit
What possessed this motherfucker to try to punk me?
What possessed this motherfucker to tell me fuck me?
Guess he thinks that I'm a lightweight
Hey yo, your shit's fucked up, so let me help you get your life straight
'Cause niggas get they ass stomped
For fucking with me, I ain't no motherfucking punk
Punk, I got some good hands, but I prefer my gat
Now where you at, 'cause I'ma slit your Kool-Aid pack
See, niggas got it all wrong
Some niggas fake the gangsta shit, so niggas think we all songs
They come up to a motherfucker jocking, mane
They wanna test a motherfucker's boxing game
That's when they get they ass trucked
'Cause when you're fucking with me, I'ma tear this motherfucker up
You're fucking with a dread
You're taking two to your head, I'm coming fed
(Is he dead?) Yeah, he dead

See, niggas make mistakes, black
They shoot, but they don't shoot to kill, so muthafuckas strike back
But I nip it at the bud
Because I'm not down for dyin, muthafucka, so I go for blood
And let em know I'm on some real shit
Not with these fake muthafuckas on the team who won't kill shit
I scream it like I mean it
I mean it like I scream it, 'cause, niggas, I done seen it
Muthafuckas with the false nuts
Come with the static and they get they funky ass shot the fuck up
So I give they ass a big blast
Instead of turnin the other cheek, I get dead up in his bitch ass
Cause yo, this shit is real life
I'd rather be packed up in a box than be runnin from a steel knife
So once I put your ass in the red
I'm goin for the head
Just makin sure you're dead
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"It had to be a murder"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"It had to be a murder"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"It had to be a murder"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"You're dyin, ho, and can't nothin save ya"

It's on, I'm smokin on some sweet leaf
Ready to put my dick up in this bitch named Charisse Cheeks
A dick-sucker's nightmare
I'm wantin some action, so I'm rollin through your hood and I be right there
I blew my horn 'cause I don't knock
The only thing that's on my mind is fuckin this bitch and puttin her ass out
But yo, this shit is breakin up
She's tellin homie she don't wanna fuck, so homie loc is breakin up
It just so happened homie seen my low
And now he's madder than a muthafucka, 'specially when he seen me blown
And now he's got some beef, too
But yo, I ain't gon' squab my partner over this freak, duke
So I cut the shit quick
And said, "Yo, we ain't gon' have to come to blows over this freak bitch
If you want her, you can have her
Because I got what I wanted, she sucked my dick, so, money, you can stab her"
But I said this to myself up
If I told homie I fucked his gal, then homie'd nut the fuck up
So I kept it on the down-low
And just laid back and watched the fuckin reaction of this clown ho
But this nigga is a real trick
He's talkin shit and wantin to jump off into some ill shit
So I told him fuck him
And if he came a little closer, then I would have to buck him
He came a little closer, so I gave him one
{*shot*} And left the muthafucka stunned
And right before I mobbed
I gave him one more for the road, just to finish the fuckin job
So off with your head, bitch
'Cause I don't fuck around with that 'return from the dead' shit
I'm makin sure I get you good
And if you twitchin like you still alive, homie loc, I wish you would
'Cause that just gives me one more reason
To grab the trigger of this muthafuckin pistol and continue squeezin
I don't believe in second gos
You only get one chance, and if you slip, then yo ass is smoke
Some niggas say they feelin this
But niggas ain't real with this
'Cause niggaroes ain't killin shit
But yo, I guess you're scared
And I be givin you 2 to your muthafuckin head
Makin sure you dead
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
'Cause I'm a fuckin killer by nature"
This is goin out to
All those fake muthafuckas
I ain't gonna say no names
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
'Cause I'm a fuckin killer by nature"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"It had to be a murder"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"You're dyin, ho, and can't nothin save ya"Embed
You can call me T double o to the L-o-double - yo

A young nigga doin damage to the mic (you sho' right)
I'm 13, but I ain't dumb
So bring it on if you muthafuckas want some
Cover your dome because it's on once again
And I'm a young nigga that's known to win
I got my street sense from these muthafuckin streets, bitch
And I'm comin real, 'cause I ain't fuckin with that weak shit
Pass me the joint and let me kick it for the old folks
All the O.G.'s back in the hood that once sold dope
Jammin-happy villains, I'm leavin on the next train
Runnin the game, so when I'm gone I be set, mayn
Got a bank account, so I can stack some g's
And have nice things like Cutlass on d's
Fresh candy paint, kickin shit live
And fuckin with this whip before I'm old enough to drive
My teacher can't stand me 'cause I give him no respect
I ain't sayin "M'am, yes M'am" until you're signin me a check
So you can miss me with that muthafuckin bum shit
I'm gettin paid makin maze, fuck the dumb shit
You ain't my mother and I ain't your fuckin son
So in reality, bitch, you gets none

Throw your hands in the air if you can feel this
I bring styles after styles after styles, dukes
I can't be faded with the shit, cause I'm a young troop
I sport them Nikes, not the Reeboks or K-Swiss
And while I'm on the subject of feet, let me say this
I kick ass like I'm Bruise Lot
And let me squash this shit: real niggas do die
Give it to me, baby, let me show you what that Deuce like
Let me hit the swisher and let me show you what my juice like
Rippin up shit in '93 like a chainsaw
Makin niggas say, "Goddamn, that little nigga raw!"
And I can square the shit off right
I'm straight from Hiram Clarke where these niggas don't fist-fight
They got they muthafuckin pistols shootin shit junk
Tust enough to get your punk ass lit up
It's not about the set I claim, 'cause I don't bang
I'm just a nigga from the hood who let his nuts hang
And I can give a muthafuck about a nigga if he's bigger

I'm the funky little nigga and I'm steady gettin bigger
Pass the killer, little nigga, let me hit me some dank
Pass the bottle, muthafucka, let me hit me some drank
I passed the forty to my partner, now he's ready to roll
Crank it up, damn fool, 'cause I'm ready to go
I be the Face (I be the Low) and we the real deal
Knockin niggas on they ass like we Evander Holyfield
Fuckin up the beat is what I'm known for
And the funky little nigga is who this muthafuckin song's for
Once upon a time there lived Lucky
Lucky got fucked because Lucky tried to fuck me
Tried to fuck you how? Hey yo, I gave the boy some shit
He came up short, then he got his ass sidekicked
Had to cut him up like a tractor
Pick-pick-pick muthafucka, I holler atcha
But you ain't gotta fuck with that snow no mo'
Why you say that, Low? 'Cause I'm the funky little niggaroe

I couldn't hear you

They try to take advantage of a nigga 'cause I'm black
They lookin' at me strange so I'm lookin' at they ass back
I got a little problem so I'm writin' you a note
A letter to the KKK from the black folks
I'm tryin' to get it on, tryin' to check the grip
And there goes officer cracker tryin' to sink my fucken battleship
Turnin' on his flashers, callin' up the dogs
Now my Lexus Coupe is flex surrounded by the hogs
Snatchin' out my seats, tellin' me I sell dope
Am I on probation or parole? I tell 'em fuck no!
Tell me mister officer, what's the problem?
What's the matter?
Why you gotta treat us like scum? Is it that a
Nigga's doin' a tad bit better than you?
And brutality is all that you crackers can do
And mark me up for resistin' yo ass
When in reality officer friendly kicked my ass, damn!
You overflex your authority too
Put your foot in my shoe, and let me try on your boot
So I can run it in reverse
You can treat me like God, and I can treat you like dirt!
The 22 years I been here I saw
Motherfuckers disrespect God before they disrespect the law
But yo I gots ta diss 'em
'Cause I refuse to be misled by this ungodly system
Mister president I beatin' on yo back do'

They're animals on the street? I'll be damned you're

In the same streets that you killed me and my brothers in."

Mister mister officer, mister officer, mister sergeant
Just because I'm young and I'm black I'm a target?
You say I'm sellin' dope but you fake
'Cause young dope dealers flash cash and make mistakes
And besides we ain't dealin' no mo'
Look at my hood, we ain't killin' no mo' so
Everybody's yellin' peace
The only war that's goin' on is goin' on with the police
'Cause they ain't stoppin' with the bullshit
If they could they'd lock us up with some chains and swing a bull whip
'Cause they figure they're the master
And they can take you to jail or take your lifes
Them sorry bastards
That makes me wonder why
The five-o can determine if we live or if a nigga dies
And to me that shit is bull
Only God can take life, but I still gotta watch the law
It's bad enough I watch the next G
But even worse I gots ta watch the motherfuckers who protect me
They fucken packin gats yo
They serve and protect, they don't respect cuz I'm black ho
"Every black man that is a carjacker will start jackin'
Police cars and watch jaw brains shed on the dashboard
Why when you pull us over?
You show us your pistols before you ask us for our driver's license
Somethin' is not right!"

Rollin through my hood in my motherfuckin' dropper
Gettin' tailgated by a motherfuckin' copper
But I ain't got respect for you motherfuckin' dickheads
'Cause y'all was straight hoes back in school nerdy shitheads
I finally figured out why you bitches roll in packs
'Cause niggas who ain't shit talk loud and pack gats
You got a fucken pistol, now you think you're a VIP man
But you can get cut because you'd be just like the next man
Holdin' me for nothin'
Runnin' my fucken license plates
My plates come clean
You call the DEA
The DEA
Says I'm a known drug dealer
Straight born killer
A motherfuckin' wig splitter
He don't know shit about a nigga but I'm black
As far as he's concerned all niggas push crack
And plus I'm 22, that really makes 'em check
A drop-top Benz, Lexus Coupe, no respect
I gotta be doin' long I'm hidin' somethin' from the demons
He gotta be stringin' yale, let's play someone that's pregnant
'Cause niggas can't have shit but I'm a motherfuckin' troop
You come to us like Luke
Undercover David Duke
Mister David Duke
Mister officer
Mister mister master
I'm pickin' out your coffin sir
Die motherfuckers, I'll send your folks my worst
A breast of pig in a motherfuckin' hearse
So fuck you motherfuckers, punk bitches take that

...It's a new day... ya know what I'm sayin'?

A new day, brings a new problem to a brother
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
'Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke
Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
And with his help, my mother made a man of me
Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in
Taught me how to save my little dividends
So when I graduated I'd have a little school money
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
And flunked outta school with the flag pole
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
'Cause we was alone, and me I bought an F home
My real pops he broke out with the style
So I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child
So now we livin' comfortable
Taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldn't see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
And ended up in a big fight
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home
My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own
And keepin' me ain't no big deal
But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels
Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke
And now the money's low
And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go
Or either try to find a job so I can help out
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
So my family can have a better place to stay
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope
And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong
She just prayin' for me heavily
Take care of her grandson
And the lord must of heard her prayer
'Cause he made me get a grip
And got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...

I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun
My baby's mother just had my first son
May eleven, I never will forget the day
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface
My first born and yo I'm a proud father
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father
And sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead
But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk, and pampers tryin ta do my part
And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes, and jewelry not the Tonka toys
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
And I don't want my son to look at life
Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it lifelike
But yet and still I let my son be a kid
Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
And now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role
Because these years he'll remember most
So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close
But I got a buncha obstacles
If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybody's got my baby
Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
"It's your daughter, don't she look like you?"
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to my Momma Duke
Because my mother knows the real deal
All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal
So now we in and outta court
Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me
Now eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G
Come to find out, the girl never had me
She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy
And biological tests can prove
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
But now I finally got a real daughter
No need for the testin'
I know that I'm the baby's father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...
I feel ya...
Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife
And got a bigger stick to fight with
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick
Because we livin' in a concentration set
And everyday, we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
And judgement day is just somethin we can't run from
So I know my number's comin' up
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up
And even though I hate killin' off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine
My brother Quanell's tryin' to keep the neighbourhood at peace
Don't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
Because we always tryin to take another brother's shit
And the cops is in the same vote
Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
And now the story's all twisted up
And if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldn't give a fuck
Because she left my partner's family with memories
And after hearin' this I know you gon' remember me
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up
Because I know what you did was wrong
But you won't realize until you dead and gone
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning
You straight up shot him from behind
But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back
You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act
But you gotta tell your story to the judge
Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
Then in reality you took care of your business
But regardless I know you wanna kill me
But I ain't goin' out like dat
Ya feel me?

Ah -

Just let us hang with you

Hangin in the hood, just shootin the breeze
My partners on the cut smokin swisher sweets
Trippin on the hoochies rollin by in they rides
Guzzlin up a forty ounce of cold St. Ides
Jammin to a tape to my partner had made
'Growin' up in the Hood' bein mixed with Face
Swisher sweet's a killer, feelin nothin but nice
Reached in my pocket for the old school dice
Pulled out a knot and dropped the dice on the flo'
And asked my partner Mike what they hittin fo'
Pulled out a yard and said, "We bettin a dove"
Tee Lee Baby, show your partner some love
Kickin back fadin, put the flame to the joint
3-2, drop baby, 3-2's your point
Back in the do' with a fo' and a ace
Picked up his ends and waved the dice in my face
And then he hollered out "School house!"
Schooled em again, now d's come in ounce
And walked away from the crap game broke
But it ain't no thing, yo

Creepin on the boulevard, actin a fool
Trippin on the broads at the old school
Music bumpin hard, never turnin it down
Trunk super tight with surround-by sound
Paint job crackin 'cause the punch ain't fade
Jammin that brand new 2Low tape
Windows all smokey, blowin coke-laced seed
I'm throwin up the deuce to the HPD
Now they lookin crazy like I sold the hay
Just another day in the heart of S.A
Roll a little further there, I seen O.G
With his brother named , S.A. O.G
They chopped up the hood, so I'm chunkin it back
And then they pulled out a $200 sack
When I saw it I almost choked

A stage full of tight MC's goin buckwild

Yeah nigga
Back in this muthafucka once again
I'm just lettin a nigga know, you know
S.A. and 5th Ward forever, fool

Niggas watch your back cause here I come again
Dropping funky shit for the 199-trey
In 1989, I sold dope for a past time
1991, they called that nigga Scarface
Started on the team when a nigga turned 16
Stackin that green sellin dope to the dope fiends
Daddy seen the scheme, down so it seemed
'Cause he hooked a nigga up with a nickel-plated triple beam
Had a lotta game with the beam, that's what it came with
Taught a nigga how to get the fuck when it jump
If static jumped off, then I was down for the dirt
When puttin in work I ain't no motherfuckin punk
Down with my partners that a nigga fucked around with
Huntin for some shit to get up into and we found it
If you had a problem with a nigga we was down with
We rolled by your set and shut your whole clique down, bitch
Niggas play for keeps in the city that I come from
Niggas talk shit from out of town, but they don't want none
If you think you want some, then go ahead and come
It ain't where you at, you stupid bitch, it's where you from
And comin through my hood is where you findin all the thugs at
Lookin for some dope and they gon' show you where the drugs at
Lookin for some trouble, well, a nigga's gonna plug that
Niggas keep they pistols up underneath they rug mat
Show your little ass, go ahead and let your ass show
Talkin that shit, punk bitch, you better dash, yo
Once I get it on, it ain't no motherfuckin holdin this
Kinda fucked up that I'm a nigga that be showin this
Niggaroe that he don't want this fool to let the trigger go
But bitch, I gots to give you one to let you niggas know
I'm lettin you bitches know

Front, back, and side to side
Front, back, and side to side
Front, back, and side to side
Side to side

I remember back in the game I used to start shit
Pumping up the hood, makin muthafuckas squab
You fucked with one nigga out of the muthafuckin clique
You had to fuck around with the whole fuckin mob
'Cause niggas rolled thick and they didn't take shit
Quick to put that ass up in a motherfuckin lynch
Whoopin on your ass, then tie you up to a fence
And since we began it's been that way ever since
My niggas used to kick it up around the fuckin pikes
Smokin swisher sweets, drinkin Miller Lites
Takin turns heatin up the motherfuckin mic
And maybe beat a buster out his motherfuckin bike
Crackerjacks kept a motherfucka on the hustle
Makin sure my business stayed square, drum tight
Wholesale flippers gave two for ten
And even gave up shakes to keep my clientele tight
Before long I had customers out the ass buyin flippers
Bearskin coats, tight ropes and fat slippers
Fresh fade daily, I had my own fuckin clippers
And all kinds of hoes on my cock suckin zipper
Hoes came in handy, but my money came first
'Cause bitches get a ghost when they see a nigga's hearse
So if I ain't have shit I had a motherfuckin mint
And could pull on my dick if worse came to worst
So if you got a problem with the way I run my business
Let a nigga know, so I can put you in your place
9 times out of 10 you ain't man enough to deal with
The born killin, dope dealin Mr. Scarface
Rougher than a motherfucka, takin no shit from a
Busta motherfucka who be flexin off the bullshit
Got my bull pump for all you bitch-made niggas
So let a nigga know when you bitches wanna flip
I'm lettin you niggas know
Front, back, and side to side
Front, back, and side to side
I'm lettin you niggas know
Front, back, and side to side
Front, back, and side to side
Side to side

I had to let you know I ain't that nigga you should toy with
So don't come in my face with that motherfuckin boy shit
Never coming soft with that 'love, peace and joy' shit
Mr., Mr. Scarface, the real deal McCoy shit
Sendin out a shot to all you busta-ass one time
Suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
'Cause you don't get props for what you doin for the cops
Except a swift kick and a mouth full of dick
Lettin motherfuckas talk ass about your gameplan
Just because you got a big gat you's the same man
That used to get your ass kicked daily back in the neighborhood
Finally got a nigga back just like you said you would
Fuck it, I'm a nigga gettin down for his cash flow
Down to clown a ho, I'm lettin you niggas know
I'm lettin you bitches know

Front, back, and side to side
Front, back, and side to side
I'm lettin you niggas know
Front, back, and side to side
You know I'm sayin?
This is for the
Front, back, and side to side
Side to side
Sendin this out to all my muthafuckin partnersEmbed
So Brad, tell me what's going on in your world?

It's fucked up, I'm looking at myself in the mirror
I'm seeing something scary; it's blurry, make it clearer
I got a funny feeling that today will be the day
That someone tries to blow my motherfucking ass away, hey
I did some wrong In My Time of Dying but
I never felt the nerve to make the motherfucking final cut
I've been depressed for no fucking reason
But every problem's got a reason; I'm kinda having trouble breathing
Somebody help me, hear my plead, my battle cry
My psychic told me, it's gonna be hard for Brad to die
She told a lie; I think I oughta shoot the bitch
I got my pistol, thinking if I should shoot the shit
Click, bang, I jammed it, I slammed it
Aw shit, goddammit!
I'm having a fucked up day to begin with
I lost a bitch, a bird, and then this
My homies tend to think I get too high
I'm doing fine, now pass me the formaldehyde
The only thing that seems to help me cope
Is when I'm drunker than a motherfucker puffin' on the chronic smoke
And then I'm able to deal with the woes
The friends, the foes, the bitches, the hoes
I gotta gang of niggas, and none of them I'd fuck
I gotta gang of bitches, and none of them I'd trust
Trust a bitch, nope, uh-uh, never
I'm having enough trouble trying to keep my damn self together
They got me by the balls
So please, help me break these motherfucking...
{*pause*} .. these motherfucking walls

I scream...there's no one there that seen me cry
I guess it's hard to scream to motherfuckers when you scream inside
I'm staring at my future, it's in plain view
I blame myself, but, Mommy dear, I blame you
'Cause now I'm finally looking at the picture
My daddy shoulda quit ya, right before he hit ya
Or swung it to the left instead
And left a big-ass stain in the fucking bed.
Because the world was fucked from the first
And having me only made the matters worse
Now look at what they did to me
That's some fucked up shit for a kid to see
Motherfuckin villain after villain, killin after killin
I'm tryin' to check a million
Damn, I'm going straight to fuckin satan
A fucking shame...about to blow my fucking brains

Shit, damn I'm dead
I'm finally through with hearing these voices in my head
Somebody finally got me
I'm looking at myself outside of my fucking body
So now I'm standing face to face
Mr. Scarface, versus Mr. Scarface
We were two different people from the start
One nigga's too smart the other too fucking hard
And both refused to be outsmarted
Dearly departed, the battle's already started
Fuck it, it's on, I swung, I duck, I weave, connect, I'm struck
Caught me with the piercing lead
And realized to myself, I shot my own fucking self!
Damn, suicide is quicker
I try to break the wall, the wall keeps getting thicker
I really start to miss my mother
I'm trying to climb the wall, it's higher than a motherfucker
And hollow's what the sound is
I'm having major problems trying to walk around it
And ain't no getting out; I'm trapped
I really should've dropped my motherfucking strap
'Cause when I think about it now
I didn't have to climb the motherfucker
{*pause*}...I shoulda broke the motherfucker downEmbed
Long as I can grind I'm scratching
And jacking cause money's got a funny way of finding
The routes thats coming out your account when you stop your grinding
And blindly got you on a major chase for paper
And now you got your eyes on my vault tryin' to take the paper
The vapors will leave niggas wit dreams to face satan
I'm pacin' with infa-red beams just waiting
Hatin' and I don't cause the conversation
He spoke wit his killer but now he's got to face him
Racin cause off in these streets you ain't promised tomorrow
So if you bring pain I bring sorrow
I warn you ain't never been down to die slowly
And surely got niggas down to die for me
You owe me and I want it all and that's that
Bitch you got to pay wit your life not scratch

Don't want no money
I want your life
Don't want no money
I want your life
We straight negero subtractors gettin down ain't no factor
We just like boys in the hood wit no actors
Jack you got niggas down to come find you
And heat your ass up and leave your yesterdays behind you
Remind you a niggas definition means killa
If he out of paper he gots to go bring the skrilla
Stretch you ain't never seen drama like I can bring it
I'll wet you and leave you face down for no reason
I seen it- ain't many ways that you can change it
I'm dangerous society got me stamped so I'mma blame it
I'm aiming a fifty cal cannon at the planet
And stampin' if any motherfucker left standin is stranded
And I want it all and that's that
Bitch you got to play wit your life not scratch

Where the fuck you wrote
You pay wit your life, what the fuck you thought?

Mr. Mr. Scarface been walking down the block
Out jumps some fiends and steals all his rocks
Pulls out a gun and shoots down all the fiends
And Mr. Mr. Scarface went up the block again

All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have, all I have, all I have in this world

Ahh yeah, hah
Mr. Scarface is back in the house once again!
Yea, droppin some of that new
Mr. Mr. Scarface Two, But yo I gotta Chilled Dude

I don't give a damn about the chatter in the background
People get beat when they step this is Ak's town
If you don't know, I recommend you check
And ask them little suckas how many heads I put to rest
I play a game but the game ain't roulette
Slangin 'caine is the thang and I bet
That there's a lot of wannabe Scarfaces
I've heard the name in ninety-nine different places
I'm here to squash it all original will speak
Scarface coming hard from the streets
I left my cut, in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn
But go to prison on a murder rap, damn that
I refuse to be a visitor at state's camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war
And many want to know why I've slowed up
It's either that or get stucked
Cause laws get happy on a days
Say huh put you in a Front Page
But this butt ain't made for no caps, homie
This buck says 'Exit Only'
So I get in the wind but hey
A brother still sold a quarter everyday
I sat around for six months black
Waitin for the day to make a comeback
And now I'm ready for combat
Mr. Scarface is back

Back in the South Park, six o'clock on the dot
Checkin on my old rock spot
I seen the same old set
Heh, the small timers see me so they jet
Buildin' 128
I got myself a bag and I can't wait
To cut em up small to make a profit
Dealers on the cut short stop it
Fiends'll see em small then they go
Where, to see the dope dealer pro
One brother got pissed
And started reachin' for his hip
.357 on your fast, fool
Like I said before, you don't get a second chance dude
Unloaded on his boy, he was hurt
Six shots put his gym in the dirt
Laid him out like a old piano rug
Gettin' pumped full of .38 slugs
Some other people stepped out y'all
Uh oh, I had to make a phone call
J. Prince: Hello?
Scarface: Hey J!
J. Prince: Wassup?
Scarface: I'm in a little trouble man
J. Prince: Where you at?
Scarface: I'm out here in South Park Village
J. Prince: Stay right there, I'll be right on
Scarface: C'mon let's take these to war man

J called up some brothers from the 5th Ward
And came back with a 5th Ward hit squad
We Ain't Playin Uzi machine
Cause Lil' J packed an M-16
Will an AK with a banana clip
And little Bill had a 12 Gauge pistol grip
I hit a little laugh and got me a buzz
And that's about the time they got drugged
One more war took place
You can call me DJ Akshen , or call me Mr. Scarface

All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face

All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Later on, all alone, you know what happened next
Another girl came by to give me sex
It was kind of strange I was throwed off
The last chick got her head blowed off
But I ain'tsta pass up no
She started strippin' at the door, oh goody
Rollin' around rubbing on my back
Shakin her down with the Bozack
I didn't have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just hug her
So I gave it up to the lady
And all she said was "Do me baby, Do me baby"
I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin' at my twelve gauge
The chip was gettin' loud I said I'm killin her
And all the while my man was hard and he steady drillin' her
I heard to step as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head
Who is it? (Fred) Who? Fred?
Who the hell is Fred, I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the hell was I do?, I got lucky
The girl packed a twenty-two
Hit him in his head, there she laid him
The pastor standin' by the door I sprayed him
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown Cadillac
It kinda messed me up at first
Cause the brother that drove that Caddy rode away in a hearse
I opened up fire on the ride G
Who I was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my back
Could this be the end of Mr. Brad?
I don't know what happened to the front
Well that's about the time the closet door it opened up
(On your ass trick!
I'll be damned if I go out like the last)
Heh, five-0's on my back, mane
They know me by the face, but they don't know my last name
Now I'm back on the case
Just call me Mr. ScarfaceEmbed
Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why..
His life was took at such an early age
A young brother who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
Til a real dealer showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn’t survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that’s the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again, cause he's in a grave
Hey yo, let's think about it, fellas
"My daddy was a dopeman, so I'mma be a dope dealer"
How will the family explain it?
"My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!"
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin fly messes me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his boy but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealer’s all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation’s got me guessin..
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die
You might also like
It was crazy how it happened
Some people rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled "get an ambulance!"
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You shoulda seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence..
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up..
Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his boy on the stretcher..
But if he survives, I’m willin to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Come a grip, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by Worthing on Scott Street
School was lettin out
"Yo you ain’t gonna shoot yet?" "WATCH ME!"
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun..
.. he shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked Black's brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullen
His brother was just dazed in a shock, "Why you do it?"
"Why you shot his moms Dudes?"
"Hehehehehe.. hah i'm Going all out, G"
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, "Aiyyo J.D. homey"
Hung it up and rolled down Dacca
Headin for the person he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven hustlers all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the Acre
One brother died in the park in the paper
Things gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray
And a second to dieEmbed
Cos I ain't ever change on you motherfuckers
And OG's spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

These youngsters think that I'm so cool
They wanna learn the game from an old school
I give em strategies to sleep on
So when they put me in the grave they could keep on
Now first on your check list
Be your own man cos your friends ain't shit
They only come around when they need to
Use that home boy shit to deceive you
Remember you don't owe nobody, niggas
Niggas put the bite to the hand that feeds, that’s your body
And they forgetting how they got there
This is life, it's a game, but it's not fair
It's hard enough trynna get by
Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
And staying drunk on the regular
Talking dope talk on your cellular
But in this game that's a no-no
The streets ain't the only ones watching, taking photos
And life ain't bitches and money
This life's bout getting this money
Because that bitch is a problem
Can't live with and can't live without her
My advice to you is stay on your grind
Keep that bitch on her back and your bank on your mind, nigga
You might also like

And we don't talk to police
That's the number one rule on the streets
Cause if you can't do the time, then you don't do the crime
Nigga keep the streets quiet
You don't upstrap unless you have to
Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
You gon' revenge somebody?
Dig two graves, just in case it's two bodies
And never bring a stick to a gunfight
One shot, one kill, you get one life
And shitting where you sleep ain't an option
People knowing where you sleep, that's a problem
You got to watch these niggas
They ain't your home boys, not these niggas
First chance you call sleep, they could murk you
So don't put squares in your circle
Cos these streets don't love nobody
You gotta pay attention to the signs, Johnny
If you a weak nigga, don't try to play hard
Better keep your punk ass out the yard

And don't get fronted, just avoid that
But if you have to, pay them boys back
Cos niggas ain't playing, it's a drought
The border is closed, the cash running out
And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks
Every nigga in the way getting shook
You got to play the game by the book
I fuck around and your life getting took
And last but not least, when you make that money
Keep it low-pro, don't say shit, dummy
And don't say shit to your girlfriend
Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen
Take notes to the game I'm providing
Stop using momma names trynna hide shit
Nigga them feds ain't stupid
You ain't the only nigga trynna do this
Riding round the hood in a four-door
Flying spur ol' rims, trynna showboat
You drawing too much attention
And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
But once you in it, it's hard to get out of
And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do
So when you get the chance to make a break for it, run fool2Embed
Up early in the morning
Waken by the sound of my cell phone
Donny hathaway singing on the ringtone
Was a homie that I went to school with
Tellin me life wasn't shit to fool with
These young niggas steady dyin' over dumb shit
Fast money for your soul
Now your done with
You hear the gun click (gunshot)
Blood stains on the walls and carpet
Pain and the hardships
Of a father identifyin' his child
From a photo of the plan
With his brains blown out now
Lets rewind to where it all took place
Started off in math class early that day
Hey! Its high school
And everybodys tryin to earn a rep
And he gone gun shot a homie to death
The impossible is happenin
Children are left to make decisions
Do ya let 'em die or kill them urself?

As I look at my life..
Remembering where ive been
I may not have been here
Cuda been in the gutter
Drowning in my tears
I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeahhhh)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot..
Oooooh
But I'm still here
I'm still here

Its just not my turn
Live the same lifestyle
Cash money to burn
Weed blowin' steady slippin' in the darkest term
When it feels like real life
Knowin' is next
Rep to take it
Be the last left
Humble yourself
In slow-mo you see your wholse life flashin'
That second from the beginning
Back to the end and that lesson
Is nothin short of what a nigga expect
Livin' life like this
This is duly respect
And I refuse to give debt
As I look at my life..

We tatted are names on our arms for fun
Writin rest in piece for the dead and gone
Thats just me
And I ain't the one to stunt
But seems like im losing somebody every other month
Thats why I walk through the hood
Tryin' talk to the hood
But some niggas is lost in the hood
And we blind to that fact
That we actin' like they wanted us to act
White man versus black
Reason why I ain't vote for Barack is cause I love him
They gonna want him hanged after that
In god we trust
What? (what?)
Money or the life of a soldier
Sent to die in the war in a fight
That never should took place
Ameri-K-K-K
Used to be a great place (great place)
Now I guess we save face (save face)

On Martin Lutha King day. (hahahahaha)

I'm still hereEmbed
Gunshots rain from a drop-top tray
Hit my little partner in his chest and there he lay
I never held a hand of a dead man never
And took a tragic death to bring the family together
So now we have to get the motherfucker and his friends
'Cause niggas in my family are all about revenge
It's all about respect, retaliation on the villain
The minute I spot the nigga close your eyes 'cause I'ma kill him
Nobody said a word everybody grab their strap
And headed for the property to peel these niggas caps
We roll for an hour before we caught up with the bitch
Turning down my music, I started cocking up my shit
Hydraulics fully juiced, so my shit was riding hot
Peeped along the side and laid the shot through the driver's side
Swerving to the left, I figured he was hurt
Put my shit is neutral drop my 'draulics in the dirt
Creeped back around in the dirt riding forward
Let my partners out so they can get up with his dogs
Making sure that everybody's heads roll with this
Before we charge the pistol we rock them clean of all the fingerprints
Niggas think the rap game changed my name it's still the same
And the fact remains motherfucker

I'm still that nigga
I'm still that nigga
Nigga
I'm still that nigga

I heard somebody pull a jack at Mickey D's
Fucked him out his paper, fucked him out his 2 keys
School motherfucker set him up for the jack
Out of 36 ounces, he may have got a quarter back
Risking his fucking life, let alone getting time
The going time for dimes they offer niggas close to 99
Might as well accept it, stuck nigga you stuck
Nigga seem to make a habit outta getting people fucked
I just can't understand it, niggas getting took for
Every fucking quarter that they ever fucking worked for
A bad moon's arising and everyone's upset
He came up short on his hands and now he's vexed
He owes a bunch of money and niggas want their shit
Ain't nothing left to do but go for broke in this bitch
You're Tony Montana, you don't give a fuck bro
Spotted that nigga, rolling thick so you stuck yo
Nose in his business and met up with the chrome trigger
Holler at the motherfucker gravedigger bitch

'Cause I'm that nigga
(Damn that shit smooth huh)
Nigga
(That's some of that, that's some of that that face beating down that block you know what I'm saying
Hey yo shit sound like it's here)
Nigga
Click click bang bang lay it down you're dead
'Cause niggas were never able to take to the head
It's hard to explain how it is when it's on
But rule number 1 is get your shit and get it going
Shooting up the enemy, making niggas hate ya
Straight shot haters, motherfuckers came to break ya
Niggas I thought you knew I cut that ass up like a butcher
And only have you seen me fires is where I put ya
I used to pack a pistol, but Uzis do it better though
1993  comin' Federal
Fuck it if I fall then I fall with my head hot
Living for my family once I see my partner toast died
Let a nigga know that they be playing this shit for real
And living in the 90s you either kill or either get killed
Somebody said there ain't no love and I can see it
So if there's gonna be war then bring it on because I'm heated
These niggas fighting fire with fire so bring your hardhat
AK-47 to your face now where your card at
Hoes usually got em, it ain't no doubt just pull it out
Better yet relax yourself motherfuckers 'cause I'ma blow it out
After 1 or 2 reps your shit sounds tired bitch
I'm on my sixth album and still kickin the fire shit
205 and I'm steady getting big
You better ask somebody you stupid bitch
'Cause I'm that nigga
(Hey, yeah)
I'm that nigga
(You ain't know? Mike D you ain't know?)
Still that nigga2Embed

Plus the stupid-ass junkie, he want something for free
Know damn well, without no money he get nothing from me

I got these crab-ass niggas trying to smoke for free
Lil G just told me that he's short this week
But how the fuck he gonna be short when I sell work so cheap?

Then told these motherfucking folks he bought some work for me

Understand and get zeroed when put in that predicament
The cars ride up and down the avenue in daytime
Nighttime the same thing -- niggas finna pay mine
Duck off with my motherfucking dope, you got some long nuts

Going honey baked H.A.M., got my trap house whamming

Like No Limit C-Murder, making moves with the dubs
Like I'm moving them birds, I got em for sale
Just like Revenge of the Nerds, I got a roomful of squares
The Feds looking at me -- get some glasses, my nigga

We got some niggas we've been fuedin' with lace
Caught one of his homies with cheese, we started sayin'
Told him , traffic and 
Offered him 5 for each key and it's crackin' him up
Now we dealin' with this nigga who be talkin' shit
Worst thing is this  robbing a brick
Normal work is on the block, it's kinda scared to come working
'Cause 5-0 dun been here 3 times and ain't searchin'
And all I had to do was take this money and cheer
Fucked around and got a whole thang
Practice the deal
Back to back, 33 ounces of crack
Rock for rock, the other 3 got dropped in the pot
Now I'm in shock
 got this wholе thing set
Instead of bringing an eighth of a kеy, 
There's motherfuckers watchin' us, we gotta move
He saw me, we gotta do what we gotta do
We hit his ass off the

Garlic dip for all rivals

Wig split, it's over with
And nobody seen shit, don't know nothin'
We mobbin, now which one of you ho's got a problem, I'll solve it
Alleviate the pain real soon, kaboom

Uh, uh, uh, uh

It was a little nigga, he was about 12 in this story I tell
Bare with the OGs, so they taught him how to hustle, but now he sell
Rocks, at the dope spot, and then get hot
Get  with Glocks
Thang with a phony game, now he slang 'caine on the block
And not a problem, (Nigga) what you proud of?
Deep in this game your mama want you out of
And this shit won't stop until a nigga wanted by the cops
 you constantly getting rid of your rocks
Maybe  you smoke up all the keys
Steady did, watch when wolves turn to Gs
On top of these OGs got these ho's droppin' to they knees
But  to have ho's
 up and now I'm sold for the bankroll
Pullin' this gat and take yours
So, fuck the 5-0
But sold the fuck up on Gs luck say sluts get no trust with yo ducks
And came up, wow, hookin' up mom's now, for a while
Sonny didn't  drug money shit
But couldn't resist a slick fit
, in the living room
Soon seen 15, so quip for the head of the kid when it booms
To whom it may concern, niggas is gettin' burned
You creep the Ds up off your 
Gots your sister geeking, turned around
The hush, 'cause this shit was flush
Fuck a trust fund, Gs bring luck tonight

You claim your man done beat your ass in when he puts his hands on ya
You called the police, told the man you ain't goin'
So he's packin' up your shit and got your suitcase ready
Sittin' in the driveway beside your black Chevy
Got your whole family wired up to go in his place
But he don't give a fuck now, they showin' his face
You probably tried to play the good girl when you saw him today
But now you got him fucked up 'cause you all in his safe?
Whatever happened to the women like mama
Who fed the whole family with love and ten dollars?
A new day came and now your ho sack chasin'
So hungry for scratch, you hoes'll track down Jason
Don't get me wrong, I got respect for Black ladies
It's the ones who playin' dumb and the check for the babies
On theyself, lookin' lovely with they hair full of spritz
Double digit for your children and they dress 'em like shit
And all they gots to do now is collect it and smile
I figured bitches had a little more respect for they child
I guess they don't, and it makes even madder just thinkin'
These hoes can get the crib and the goddamn Lincoln
I know you hate me 'cause the truth hurts
Sit on your ass and receivin' the salary while the dudes work
Let's get for real because the world needs it
Twenty-five hundred dollars a child? Come on, the girl greedy

Now say the nigga ran a Mickey D's
And made the money for the cracker who own it, shoulda did the shit for free
But now you got your hands out like Gretchen
You greedy motherfuckers want cash 'cause y'all left him
So now we lookin' at the short end of it
And bitches comin' up off they babies and y'all love it
They need to rewrite the law in every state
It's lovely when you do for child but what it take?
How come it got to be an income thing?
Claimin' they ain't got the income and then come change
And then you wonderin' the reason they left ya
'Cause she done had a talk with her friends and they didn't help
To realize it's just a dick thing
And with the money, she can play with herself, that's when the shit changed
It kinda starts a new outlook, don't it?
Especially when you offer the world and she ain't want it
And y'all tellin' me the men cheatin'?
We ain't as bad as you make us to be, 'cause y'all greedy

Now I ain't write this song to downgrade ladies
Installin' more respect in they brains for our babies
We send 'em money for necessities
But the game done got so cold at this point, we need a referee
They say the baby needs a place to stay
But greed done got her huntin' for houses by Penny Hardaway
But just remember, all dogs got days
And even while you wait to exhale, you all pay
So women, stop complainin' 'bout your men
Be glad they got a nine to a five and not a ten
In the state pen', sendin' pictures off, gettin' skinny
Claimin' they ain't takin' no dick while you face plenty
And now you got to hustle up 'cause y'all need it
You wanted everything at one time and we all seen it
Try to see whose grass was greenest
And ended up stuck, sellin' for fuck 'cause you're all
