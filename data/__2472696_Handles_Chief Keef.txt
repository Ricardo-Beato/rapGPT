16 ContributorsHandles Lyrics
Hey man, RIP my brothers, man
RIP Blood, RIP Cap
I be around blood brothers all the time
Zaytoven
I'm just gon' do flexin' for 'em
Man, I walk in the mall, I'm flexin' for 'em all the time, you know?
I go cash, I buy ten pairs of, of the Cap shoes, you know?
I'm boolin', you know, I'm countin' motherfuckin'
I'm countin' big face hundreds, you know?
With the dopeman

Moment of silence, light some candles
Bitch, I'm ballin' and I got the handles
Smoking so much weed I'm fogging up my windows
I'm riding foreign and it got the handles
I'ma handle these niggas out the rental
My car be geeking, all I did was touch the handle
Leave it up to me to get this money, I'm gon' handle it
I got the ball and I got the handles, bitch

H-A-N-D-L-E
I'm off the B-R-O-W-N B-A-G
Any morning he cannot beat me in the S
Your Supercharger versus my M3, yes
I was raised to handle business, don't bring problems to the nest
And for all the big niggas I'ma handle it with TEC's
Squeeze the trigger, hold the handle
We got over on you, swindle
Come and handle this
You might also like
Moment of silence, light some candles
Bitch, I'm ballin' and I got the handles
Smoking so much weed I'm fogging up my windows
I'm riding foreign and it got the handles
I'ma handle these niggas out the rental
My car be geeking, all I did was touch the handle
Leave it up to me to get this money, I'm gon' handle it
I got the ball and I got the handles, bitch

Got the ball, got the handles, got the cars, got the weed
Came through flexing, she love for me
Glock on me go boom, boom, boom, boom
Bitch, Bone Thugs be me
I smoke the best weed, bitch, the bubbly with me
Ain't no nigga just fucking with me
Came through flexing, that's nothing to me
Nigga getting mad, that's cuffing to me
This bitch choose, said she love her some Keef
This bitch choose, said she love her some me
Then I got mad, said she fucking with me
Bitch, I'm so baked, it's a oven with me
A burger and a fry, that's McDonalds to me
I'm so glad, I brought Rondo with me
I'm somewhere countin' cash, smokin' weed
Then these fuck niggas say they comin' for me
I hope nigga know I got a llama on me
I hope nigga know I got drama on me
Money got your bitch with the doors up
Now your luck suck 'cause your bitch she's slobbing on me
She like, "Sosa, you nutting on me?"
I'm like, "Couple times, too much money on me"
Told lil' bitch she ain't coming with me
You can go anywhere but with me
Moment of silence, light some candles
Bitch, I'm ballin' and I got the handles
Smoking so much weed I'm fogging up my windows
I'm riding foreign and it got the handles
I'ma handle these niggas out the rental
My car be geeking, all I did was touch the handle
Leave it up to me to get this money, I'm gon' handle it
I got the ball and I got the handles, bitchEmbed
