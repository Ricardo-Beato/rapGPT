53 ContributorsBallin Lyrics
Ayy, I just was telling Kesha
Like, I'mma have dolphins and shit in my crib

Waking up livin' life with no outcome (With no outcome)
Fucked that bitch outside, gave her out cum (Gave her out cum)
By any means, just like Malcolm (Just like Malcolm)
Live by any means just like Malcolm (Just like Malcolm, yeah)
I be outside all the way from the mornin' to dark (Mornin' to dark)
All these diamonds in my teeth, yeah, I barely can talk (Barely can talk)
I be ballin' like I am Derrick Rose (Skrrt)
Killin' my competition like I'm Rogue
Luv Is Rage, I'm in the crowd at my shows

I just want all of my niggas to ball
I just want all of my niggas to see
All the shit that I might not get to see
I just want all of my niggas to eat
I might just pull out that lean, that's a four
I might just jump in a 'Rari with two doors
I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes (Yeah)
I might just pull up and stunt like a boss (Boss, ayy, ayy)
I spent seven thousand right on the coat (Coat)
On the real, I don't know how to spell broke
If she talk too much, I put dick in her throat (Yeah, yeah)
I be ballin' like I am Derrick Rose
Killin' my competition like I'm Rogue
Luv Is Rage, I'm in the crowd at my shows
You might also like
Ayy, counting money 'til I'm blue in the face (Blue in the face)
Yeah, count money and they blue in the face
Yeah, I fucked that bitch 'til she blue in the face
Wearin' Balmain, extra skinny, skinny
Skinny all the way 'til I'm blue in the waist
Yeah, mixin' lean, everywhere soda
Ayy, unlike my heart, my cup way colder (Way colder)
Yeah, Xanny bars got me way bolder (Way bolder, yeah)
Ayy, I just be countin' the bank (Whoa)
I ball like I am Durant
Ayy, your bitch I swear she a fan
Ayy, I put that money on you
Yeah, lil' nigga, you'll get fanned
Yeah, livin' life like I'm a rock star
I do this shit for my fans (For my fans)
My brother, he is a block star
He amazing with the pans

I just want all of my niggas to ball
I just want all of my niggas to see
All the shit that I might not get to see
I just want all of my niggas to eat
I might just pull out that lean, that's a four (Haha)
I might just jump in a 'Rari (Skrrt-skrrt) with two doors
I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes (Yeah)
I might just pull up and stunt like a boss (Boss, ayy, ayy)
I spent seven thousand right on the coat (Coat)
On the real, I don't know how to spell broke
If she talk too much, I put dick in her throat (Yeah, skrrt)
I be ballin' like I am Derrick Rose (Skrrt)
Killin' my competition like I'm Rogue
Luv Is Rage, I'm in the crowd at my shows
Paid a lot of money for this ice (For this ice)
On the real, I think I found my wife (Found my wife, Brittany)
Always in my hair just like some lice (Like some lice)
When I miss a call, you know I hit her twice
Put it on my life
Higher than a kite (Than a kite)
Living life like I can't die
They live for me and that's the reason why

I just want all of my niggas to ball
I just want all of my niggas to see
All the shit that I might not get to see
I just want all of my niggas to eat
I might just pull out that lean, that's a four
I might just jump in a 'Rari with two doors
I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes
I might just pull up and stunt like a boss
I spent seven thousand right on the coat
On the real, I don't know how to spell broke
If she talk too much, I put dick in her throat
I be ballin' like I am Derrick Rose
Killin' my competition like I'm Rogue
Luv Is Rage, I'm in the crowd at my shows5Embed
