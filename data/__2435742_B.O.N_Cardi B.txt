11 ContributorsB.O.N LyricsFuck all that talking shit
Fuck all that stalling shit
I came here to eat
I ain't with that starving shit
Been on the hustle since young, so I been involved in shit:
The fakes, the snakes, heartbreaks-- I mean all of it
I'm in my zone now and I ain't gon fold up
They like Cardi all grown up yea bitch I glo'ed up
They ain't see the blizzard coming these niggas done froze up
They mad they been sleeping on me just be like you woke up
I don't make scenes I just make movies
Clip after clip after clip call it a uzi
I feel like a bad ass, I feel like I'm Boosie
They quick to judge a bitch just wish they knew me
I know a couple hittas done pulled a couple triggers
Violate me they gon come and get you
And I'm tired of y'all baby mamas y'all nothing but drama
Always worrying about the new bitch why you so foolish watching my moves you like how I do shit
I make you feel insecure but that's not my problem
Just worry about your kid and I'ma keep popping my collar
And for those who want to know I'm not your average hoe
I be on my bullshit, but yea I got standards though
Yeah I fucked a couple niggas pulled a couple tricks
Bust a couple splits sucked a couple dicks
But there is a story to everything and that's just real shit
My family had to eat and I had to pay the rent
If it's green I'ma get it please stay the fuck out my business
Bitch try me I promise you get it
Bitch try me there will be no winning
Gotta watch all these faces there's too many counterfeits
Sometimes when you hear them say I got you you can't even count on it
That's why I fuck with my bitches only my bitches
My day one bitches so please do not fuck with my bitches
That's a brick in your face and you gon need stitches
I see that you moving suspicious
200 dollars, they do you with quickness
That's word to my niece I'm not kidding
I fuck with them BONs and they get viciousYou might also like3Embed
