30 ContributorsFortunate Lyrics
I highly doubt that y'all think about sex
Anywhere near as often as I think about death
Go ahead and shout at the top of your lungs
But don't wake the baby up, we got a lot to get done
That little light indicates a connection
And if it's all the same I'd like to make a suggestion
See, if everybody on this comet agreed
We could set the clock to whenever we want it to be
I just might just modify the mileage
I don't know much, but I'm confident the fight's fixed
So high that I feel like a pilot
Falling out the sky full of brilliant brightness
Hurry up, stir me up
You gotta learn the words before the whole Earth burning, but
We wouldn't even need to recognize your birthday
If you were the center of the universe in the first place
If I had feathers I would fly away
If I felt fresher in fur I would hibernate
If I ever figured out how to communicate
Maybe then we could accumulate
For now face the wall, I ain't the same as y'all
A real friend wouldn't make you take the fall
Sometimes life'll try to break your balls
With the long list of missed wakeup calls
You might also like
You know I wanna feel special
Walk around the festival carrying a big stuffed animal
I try not to make a mess though
Gotta stay sensible, ain't nobody coming with the antidote
I wanna watch you grow
And I wanna leave the planet better off than it was handed to me
And I don't know, there's possibility
So I settle for selling my soul to the slaves of the land of the free
I don't wanna leave my family tree behind
I don't want no one to miss me like I miss you
But I don't wanna take up too much time
I'm not trying to run away from the line we drew
The sunshine seems to feel so seamless
The soldier is a dreamer and a realist
And history sealed this
Taught me that a hero ain't nothing but a field trip
Nah, I know you're down to do something profound
Put a stick in the ground to prove you was around
No amount of time will ever be considered enough
I'm trying to tether it up and live forever through love
We're not lucky, but we're fortunate
I'm pretty sure of it
And all the life we wasted trying to make some bread
Might've been better spent trying to raise the dead7Embed
