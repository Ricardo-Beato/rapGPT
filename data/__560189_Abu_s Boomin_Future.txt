25 ContributorsAbu’s Boomin Lyrics
Metro Boomin in this motherfucker. Aha-ha-ha My niggas love you, but anyway, look. Got it all, got it all, look man, I got my one, my last nigga in the city with the clean. I ain’t talking about that bottom of the bottle syringe shit with that plastic hair dryer reseal, or that blue top, we ain’t none of that bullshit. So look, the one rule is, when we go in don’t say nothing to Abu. He old school, you feel me?
Kajra Re, Kajra Re, Kajre Re, 'Jre Re
Cut- Abu, can you cut that shit down man! Please!
Oh, Freeband, Freeband, welcome back to my store. Loyal customer. You see my store still booming in the drought, ha-ha-ha
Uh, he looking for some clean
Clean? Mm? What the fuck are you drinking, I thought we were drinking dirty?
Naw, hell naw, man, I got 80- $200 for you, right now, man. We just need a pint
Well just, just go get it out the back, Abu, I’m out here waiting. Let me get some cigarillos and- and- g- and grab a couple of Sprites
Just for you only I give a special price
Keep that number right where I need it, baby and we gon', we-
Yeah, bruh, I’m tryna fuck with that 86 hunnid
Hmm? Who the fuck is the friend?
Goddamn
What in the fuck are you talking my number? Hmm?
Man, come on Abu, you open 24/7 now, man, come on
We say 7/24, not 24/7
Man, come out here with that country shit
