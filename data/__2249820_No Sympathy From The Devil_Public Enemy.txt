7 ContributorsNo Sympathy From The Devil LyricsNo sympathy.....
No sympathy.....

News fit for rhyme, BS fit to spit
The hate that hate produced swung up in a noose
Most them history pages comin’ off stages
Colors, genders, and ages
(Devil) Black, Brown, Yellow, Red, but White...
Supremacy, tendency in currency
!!!GASP!!!
Estrogen robbin' my oxygen
Still dissin' skin, inform my next of kin (Woop, woop)
(Now get in the back of the car for what? Let’s go!) Crazy
Government created grown-up 80's crack babies
Treat your ass cold 'til the frostbite bites
In December, the devil remembers

Man don’t you worry ‘bout (God) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (Evil) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (God) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (Evil) No! Get down

Pitch black
It was you who got in the devil’s bed
Didn't you see this coming?
The great satan, a global terrorist
Didn’t you see the smoke?
Maybe it’s time for us to pick up the gun
No sympathy from the devil
You might also like
Ain't lettin' it slide, flippin' love and genocide
Ain't forgiven that spit that came with a culture kit
Since when did you decide the truth should hide?
You 20-30-40, I’m 55!
Double nickel, sick this cell
Like sickle, I ain’t your typical
Watch what you heard, ain’t revenge of the nerds
I’m in my September, but the devil remembers

Man don’t you worry ‘bout (God) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (Evil) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (God) No! Get down
Man don’t you worry ‘bout (Evil) No! Get down

There’s been nights where them knights cursed us (Us)
Who fills the jail cells right up and first us
I don’t believe a damn word I receive
Gotta lotta nerve sayin', "If you don't like it just leave"
Like who gives a damn if they kill another man
Woman or child behind another smile
Now see young folk pass the baton
In the same old thing
Carry on, carry on
No sympathyEmbed
