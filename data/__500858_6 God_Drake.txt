Rrrr ting (Brrt, brrt)

I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Ga, grrra-ga-ga-ga-ga)
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy (Watch that)
Get hurt, boy (Get hurt)
Aww, here go another muhfucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy (First)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy (Work)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy (Work)
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy (Worst)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business (Get it)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it (Naw)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Why?)
You too worried 'bout the bitches (What you worried 'bout?)
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it (Try a ting)
She'll admit it, she'll admit it (Try a ting)
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished (Why?)
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy (Hot up in the 6)
Shit hot up in the 6 right now
Shit hot up in the 6, boy (Hot up in the 6)
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now (Ga, ga, ga)
Come see us and get it fixed, boy (Hey)
Black Benz on the road, boy (On the road)
Already had a Rolls Royce (On the road)
Sold a couple Bentley last week
Them were my old toys (Man, this shit is old)
I give a fuck about old boy (Man, that boy old)
I give a fuck about his squad, boy (Man, that thing old)
I give a fuck about your mob, boy (Oh)
I'm the real 6 God, boy (Woah)
I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
Goddamn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
You might also like
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
Yeah, so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now670Embed
