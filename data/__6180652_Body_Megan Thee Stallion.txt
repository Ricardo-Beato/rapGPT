Yeah, you look good, but they still wanna know where Megan at (Where Megan at?)
Saucy like a barbecue but you won't get your baby back
See me in that dress and he feel like he almost tasted that (Ah, ah, ah)
Num, num, num, num, eat it up, foreplay, okay, three, two, one
You know I'm the hottest, you ain't ever gotta heat me up

If I wasn't me and I would've seen myself, I would have bought me a drink (Hey)
