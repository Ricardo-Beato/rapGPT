So, Friday
I  went to see DJ Superdelic DJ
And  while he was DJing, I walked to him and I asked him for a picture
And he told me no (No)
And I said, "No?"
You  know what he said? (You bitch, you)

No,  not her, I'm talking about you (You bitch, you)
This is what I'ma say to you when I see you (You bitch, you)
Out  my face, out my space, give me room (You bitch, you)
Shit's hot, tick tock, let it boom (You bitch, you)
All that sugar, all that cake, and all that spice (You bitch, you)
I ain't fronting, I said it once, and I ain't saying it twice (You bitch, you)

Alright  now, I need all the ladies to the dance floor right now
No Lookie-Lous and no wallflowers, ya dig?

Little square in the air (Pick it up, drop it down)
(Pick it up, drop it down, pick it up, drop it down)
Little square in the air, do it there (You bitch, you)
(Work that shit, work that shit, rock that shit)
Oh yeah, little square, oh yeah
(Pick it up, drop it down, pick it up, drop it down)
Little square, do it there, oh yeah (You bitch, you)

Hola, me llamo Anitta, blowing through your speakers
I'ma make your head rewind, yeah
Este ritmo e' peligroso
Mira cómo gozo
Cuando empiezo a bailar, yeah
Booty got you impressed (Impressed)
Clap, clap, that's our business (Business, yeah)
From favela to big checks (Big checks), yeah, yeah (You bitch, you)
De Brasil a Colombia (Colombia)
Bola bola rebola (Rebola)
Snoop Dogg, bet you heard that, yeah
Mueve el cuerpo con talento
Dale sin remordimiento (You bitch, you)
Bitch, you better drop it like it's hot (You bitch, you)
Mueve el cuerpo con talento
Dale sin remordimiento (Ooh, ah)
Bitch, you better drop it like it's hot (You bitch, you)

Alright now, I need all the ladies to the dance floor right now
No Lookie-Lous and no wallflowers, ya dig?

Little square in the air (Pick it up, drop it down)
(Pick it up, drop it down, pick it up, drop it down)
Little square in the air, do it there (You bitch, you)
(Work that shit, work that shit, rock that shit)
Oh yeah, little square, oh yeah
(Pick it up, drop it down, pick it up, drop it down)
Little square, do it there, oh yeah (You bitch, you)2Embed
