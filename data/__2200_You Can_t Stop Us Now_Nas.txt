41 ContributorsYou Canâ€™t Stop Us Now Lyrics
From Willie Lynch to Willie Hutch, right on, we Superfly
Made Gucci the shit, Louie too, suits and ties
Player trophies, pray to Goldie
Picture wax museums full of Black Panth's and triple OGs
Aunt Jemina hoes, historic horse shit
Girls from long time ago, stagecoach with the horse, kid
Witchdoctors, good ol' pickpockets
Sip moonshine, so-called coons, shines, and darkies
I love y'all, pyramids to cotton fields
To Wrigley Fields, forgotten men who did get killed
Crispus Attucks, the first blasted
Peace to the rich lady purse snatcher shot in the back
I know your hunger kid, I know they hung your dad
Burnt ya mama crib, I know that hurt you bad
Minstrel shows, from gold to shackles and back to gold
We act like we home, matter of fact, we are home
Bad attitudes, octoroon skin tones
Slave food turned to soul food, collards to neck bones
Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag
Bet she had a nigga with her to help her old ass!

As James Baldwin says:
"You can only be destroyed by believing that you really are
What the white world considers - a nigga"
You might also like
Ohh, no matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now (oh, no matter)
No matter how, hard you try
You can't stop us now (no)

Can't be stopped
Yo, on Dateline, the other night they showed hate crimes
Gave a blood time cause he fought with his canine
Beastiality, humane society
Go to China, see how they dine, see what they eat
Better yet, ask PETA, whoever, which animal makes suede?
If not for suede, would you have survived the Dark Ages?
Cannibal ways of the ancient Caucasians
Stare you like you're steak tartar, pinot noir
David Star on the chain of Sammy Davis
He helped pave the way for Southern crankers and them Harlem shakers
Now we gettin' our papers, they try to censor the words
And stop our money comin' but you can't escape us - haters

Ohh, no matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now (oh, no matter)
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop us now (no)
You can't stop us now2Embed
