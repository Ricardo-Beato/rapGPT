Sosa, baby
Blood Gang, baby

Fifth Gang, baby
Get It Gang, baby

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Do I want to freak you? Yes

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
I'm getting commas, yes
I'm riding foreigns, yes
I can fuck your mama, yes
It ain't nothing, mane
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

Baby, do I love you? No, no, no, no, no
But where you tryna go, go, go, go, go?
Benihana's, Wokcano's, no, no, no, no
Girl, we gon' take it slow, slow, slow, slow, slow
Girl, my sex is like yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
I swear it's the best, best, best, best, best
Girl, it's gon' leave you stressed, stressed, stressed, stressed, stressed
When I hop up out that wet, wet, wet, wet, wet
You know how I'm rocking, tweet, beat, skeet then delete
She french kiss the D like oui, oui, oui, oui and the oui
At the restaurant, I eat, eat, eat, eat and I eat
When we get home, she eat, eat, eat, eat Chinese

Baby, I don't drive slow, ow, ow, ow, ow
Don't care 'bout running from the po, wow, wow, po-po
Is you gon' ride? Is you gon' roll, wow, wow, wow, wow?
She like eating Wonton and she like to wine and dine
Baby, I ain't got the time, tried to tell it, I went blind

Do I want it freaky? Yes
I got my heater, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
