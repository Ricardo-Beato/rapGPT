12 ContributorsM’s on Ice Lyrics
J. White Did It

I just dropped an M on my ice (Doo, doo, doo)
I just dropped an M on my life (Wow)
I just dropped a M on my life (Damn)
I just dropped a M on my ice
Had to take the roof off (Yeah)
Hit it with the chainsaw (Huh? Huh?)
I just dropped a M on her life (Wait)
I just dropped a M on her ice
Go, go (On this ice)
Go (I just dropped a M)
Go, go (On this ice)
Go (I just dropped a M)

Ice, ice, ice, ice cold on a ho (Wow)
East Atlanta Santa settin' the price on the snow (Woo)
2020, I just dropped a M on my wrist (Brr)
I don't like the word budget, I don't got no bucket list (Damn)
Anything I want, I just buy that shit (Bow)
Twenty thousand for the fit, ten thousand more for the kicks (Gucci)
Anything you wanna get, I supply that shit (Skrrt, skrrt)
Bitch, how high you wanna get? (Mwah) Got everything from a brick (Gucci)

I just dropped a M on her life (Wait)

V12 cylinder (Nyoom), chandelier the ceiling, uh (Huh?)
I just dropped a M on her (M), I keep droppin' dick in her
I just bought another watch, I lower the temperature (Burr)
Haters gettin' sicker, bruh, please bring a thermometer
Everything is wonderful, my floor mat match my winter fur
Drop the top, I'm warmin' up and it ain't even summer, bruh
Ballers puttin' that ice on her, still can't put no price on her (Nah)
Money keep enticin' her, that's what I bought these diamonds for (Gucci)

I just dropped an M on my ice (Doo, doo, doo)
I just dropped an M on my life (Wow)
I just dropped a M on my life (Damn)
I just dropped a M on my ice
Had to take the roof off (Yeah)
Hit it with the chainsaw (Huh? Huh?)
I just dropped a M on her life (Wait)
I just dropped a M on her ice
Go, go (On this ice)
Go (I just dropped a M)
Go, go (On this ice)
Go (I just dropped a M)Embed
