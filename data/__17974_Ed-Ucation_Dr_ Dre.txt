30 ContributorsEd-Ucation Lyrics
Aww they say uhh..
.. a black man is a pimp
Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
On planet motherfuckin Earth, is her momma
It's her MOMMA that told her
"Get a man that got a good job gurl!
Make sure he got a good car gurl!
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin gurl!"
What happened to just fallin in love with a nigga with a bus pass --
-- just cause you love the nigga?
But I'm the pimp motherfucker!
I gotta be the player!
Biggest hoes, on planet Earth..
.. are walkin through the motherfuckin neighborhood
You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
But you fucked him anyway!!!
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
You went and got pregnant - didn't you bitch, DIDN'T YOU!!
THE OL' KEEP A NIGGA BABY
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
"Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here;
Cause that nigga ain't shit."
How bout bein a woman, and tellin the kid the truth
That yo' momma, you was a ho!
TELL THE KID!
Momma was a ho, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
That's why he ain't here - but he a good nigga
Cause he take care of his REAL family
I was just a dumb bitch, tryin to keep, a nigga that I wantedYou might also like6Embed
