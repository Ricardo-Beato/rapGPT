1 ContributorGet Off My Dick Lyrics
You wish nigga keep walkin
If I let you hang ain't no thang, but, let me do all the talkin
I'm on a strict  diet
So don't tell nobody you me cause, I'll deny it
Niggas who jock me to be shot
Cause even if your shit went triple platinum I'm like, could've been better ak
You never catch me overwhelmed, I'll never let it through
Shit I don't even wanna get credit where credit is due
I got too many penny ante brothers 

Since you're leery when you're near me you spoke and I didn't speak
You spoke again, I take it that you didn't hear me
For good reason though, it ain't that your ears don't work
It's just that I'm who I am, and you're a fuckin jerk
I gotta rep to uphold if you're askin me
So anytime after three stop harassin me
I know I kick the fly shit that you gotta like
But niggas ride my dick so bad, I gotta buy a bike
I know a million motherfuckers and 
 and you ain't one of them
