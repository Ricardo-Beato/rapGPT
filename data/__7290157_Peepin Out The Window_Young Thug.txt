Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Peepin' out the window
Peepin' out the window
Peepin' out the window
Peepin' out the window

Peepin' out the window (Yeah, yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead, wanna smoke me like I'm indo (Oh)
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin', I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely
Bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dogs bossed up

I doubled up, I don't do no chores no more
I ain't steppin' on these niggas like no rugs no more
Find myself carin' way too much, ain't got no shrubs no more
But got way bigger shows, I ain't chargin' dubs no more
I charge a half a million dollars just to walk out
I hatе the police, but I'm big, so they brought cops out
I got a gun, shoot sixteen timеs, but it's fun sized
Sign on the dotted lines
One time for the ones saw me come from nothing
Speakin' of nothing
Pussy niggas know not to play, I ain't goin' for nothing (Yeah)

Peepin' out the window (Yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead, wanna smoke me like I'm indo (Oh)
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin', I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely
Bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dogs bossed up

Youngin' jumped inside the game, he got some fuckin' diamonds
We make temporary decisions, change the fuckin' climate
Run with D-boys, yeah, them boys who be runnin' the lobby
Change the channel, you know I'm up next by the way I pop it
I sip on syrup a lot, but no one understand me
I told my mama, "No more sufferin', I made it"
You should've seen all these motherfuckers' faces
I told my brothers, "We ain't goin' back to basic"
Ever since I copped the Hellcat
Niggas still wonderin' why, like, "BSlime, you did that"
I'm kickin' my ones and twos, chillin' at the rib shack
Wishin' I can bring my dog back from the fuckin' jailmates

Peepin' out the window (Yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead, wanna smoke me like I'm indo (Oh)
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin', I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely
Bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dogs bossed up
Peepin' out the window
All I see is a bunch of racist-ass cops tryna catch a nigga slackin' like Jim Crow
Had to make it through the worst on the turf, out the dirt, nigga stayin' down, ten toes
I done seen a lot of struggle that came with this game
She cried, but she gon' lie just to fuck on my chain
I drunk codeine and popped one just to stimulate my brain

Peepin' out the window (Yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead, wanna smoke me like I'm indo (Oh)
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin', I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely
Bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dogs bossed up

Hell yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peepin' out the window
Yeah, yeah
See the opps risin' from the dead when I look out my window
All this water in these baguettes, I might turn into Nemo
