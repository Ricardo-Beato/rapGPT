All the lonely guys.. {*echoes*}

Just gettin' off my job, ‘round Wall Street, with the ties on
Finest girl, a brother think he ever set eyes on
Nice day, weather sunny, as he made a run for honey
With a warm personality, well it’s on the money
I’d have tounged her right there, seemed kinda fun up there
Wonderin’ there, as he tellin' me he could get the underwear
Meanwhile, still jockin' her, like a real sucka
Sister wench was so fine, she could have AIDS, I’ll still knock her
Heart beatin' for her since a brother didn’t figure meetin'
As I ask her if she’s single, “yeah, caught my nigga cheatin'”
“Nice to meet ya,” leaves… she had dope combined features
Watched her walk away and observin' the fine creature
Next day again, went in uninvited, super angry with us
Ran into so much that her and her friends had start to hang with us
They pair and move, though fine, they both swine
“Can I take you out to movies? Wine, dine, the whole nine?”
She condones, good riddance, nigga slid this on her
Didn’t want to get to bone her, though I knew I didn’t own her
And I could’ve made a move, a little will power ‘cause although
That she told me she liked him as a friend and that was all
And since hang with us, she already told her, cool he freaked her
The week on my birthday bought me a pair of Gucci sneakers
“Did she like me?”, racin’ the thought. “Was it a sign?” Guess it weren’t immoral
When she saw me, definitely this is kinda special
Since for this dish, none abate, but everybody wanna play
“How long is money gonna wait?” So I asked a honey on a date
And she accepts, though thought it wasn’t much  a plan
Windows On the World, even had the nerve to touch her hand
Though not lookin' at. Bashful? No, sir
Suppose I was so shy and then the hon' pulls closer
Thought “clever hint”, so what she straight, never been so excited
And convinced, kiss, in heaven ever since
Holdin' her hand too, chillin', future plan to build
Couldn’t believe my dream fulfilled and then that girl began to ill by sayin:
You might also like
Lady if you will
Say you’re the one that sent for me to thrill
Someone that I can hold close in my arms
With all the charms of you
All the charms of you
Of a lady, this world is just for ladies
A heart screams out to ladies
A world of love’s for youEmbed
