6 ContributorsKnob Broke Lyrics
You know if you've been following my career for a while
You know I don't scream as I used to
You could say my shit talking has matured somewhat
Still get the same point across
You know that shit you be like in the quote
I guess you could say my speech be my work
So I let my work speak for itself
(I go to work, I do my job
I gets it in, I goes hard
Think I had too much to drink, you feel me
God, too turned up, I broke the knob)

I bet you won't
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet you niggas won't
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet these bitches won't
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these niggas wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these bitches wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, I think the knob broke (4x)

Homie just keep it real, I know what you was thinking
Between all the hater raising and all that liquor you drinking
You was probably thinking that I go out like a sucker
That’s what you get for thinking you ignorant motherfucker
It’s Jeezy G from the gutter, these rappers fraudently busters
Post up, served the cluckers and used to dare em to cuff us
Got the work from the Mexicans used to dare em to trust us
‘Cause we taking that shit like it got caught up in customs
Bad bitches they lusting’ real niggas discussin
See them taking them shots, they bounce off of them it’s nothing
Don’t let this rap shit fool you , run up on him, he busting’
Don’t let these rap niggas fool you , that’s the end of discussion
See I would die by this shit, and whatever that’s worth
You niggas step in my yard I go to war bout my turf
See , Young one of the realest niggas that's walking this earth
Nigga you heard what I said and that’s the end of my verse

I bet you won't
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet you niggas won't
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet these bitches won't
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these niggas wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these bitches wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, I think the knob broke (4x)
Nigga if you’re about to issue, then you know how I feel
Look dead in your eyes and let you know that it’s real
I see these niggas is faking so I’ma be realistic
See these niggas is playing so let me kick the ballistics
Throw that brick in the oven, bake that bitch like a biscuit
Way I weigh up this yolo, you'd think I majored in physics
And I’ma stay sucker free, that’s right I’m gon keep my distance
Can’t fuck round with these suckers, I learned that there through experience
If the subject is trapping then I’ma head of the class
Heard you niggas is broke, and you might need a cash
Yes, some niggas get money, but that shit don’t make ‘em real
If you lie good enough, you just might get you a deal
I’m a real one for real, real shit pay my bills
If I wasn't rappin, baby I’d be still counting mills
If I wasn't rappin, baby I’d be still toting steel
See I made this shit yea, so I can turn up for real
I go to work, I do my job
I gets it in, I goes hard
Think I had too much to drink, you feel me
God too turned up, I broke the knob

I bet you won't
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet you niggas won't
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I bet these bitches won't
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these niggas wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I made these bitches wanna
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up, I think the knob broke (4x)Embed
