Peace, peace
Yo, Nasir Bin Olu Dara Visqu Allah
Fist full of dollars in a dice game God
D&G glasses, cloth Kangols, guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking, fresh to my ankles, thankful
Gangster see gangster do, I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professors
More knowledge than Webster dictionary, obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up, gut 'em like fish, Swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up, sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy, we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors, pellets spray your familia
You screaming like you love war

Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get dropped
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
You might also like
Peace
Fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the street, you a Sisqó fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em, fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug, I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
'Cause now instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog, it's digital criminals turned rapper, times is changing
Niggas get flashier, houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far, your mouth get all white
When I'm near you, I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you 'posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you wanna squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but

Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Peace, I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War cost money and man I got too many spots
Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me, you're not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block, what
Brothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their main niggas'll take the contract, surprise
So we play a mental game, intimidation
Got pussy niggas getting pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day and
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault or the safe
I got some niggas with acid, get it thrown in your face
Play dirty, catch your moms in J-30
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now

Everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
But everybody's crazy
And somebody's gon' get shot, get robbed, get done, get stomped, get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thugs love hip hop3Embed
