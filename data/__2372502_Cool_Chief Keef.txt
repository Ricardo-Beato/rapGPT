6 ContributorsCool Lyrics
Aye, aye, aye
Click-clack, rahh, bang
Gang gang, nigga
Gang gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch
Bang, gang

I'm sitting at my mansion, cooling booling, smoking tooka
Niggas acting like they shooters, niggas really losers
Pull up on a nigga, click-clack, then I lose 'em
Skudda skuh, now they seen the cops, click-clack dulah duh, bang

Smoking tooka with my Ruger
My mothafucking Ruger got a ruler
Shoot this mothafucka at your lil medula
You ain't talking cash boy, you not cool

Pull up driving fast, my bitch say I'ma fooler
I'm smoking on this tooka cause I'll lose it
I lose my fucking mind and get to screwing niggas
Pull out this damn Glock and get to doing niggas
Nigga I tote Glocks, FNs and Rugers, nigga
My Ruger got a ruler and it'll shoot ya, nigga
Spank your ass like your teacher
And then I go and see the Deacon
I've been getting money since I had Beepers
Now I'm riding in foreigns and Beamers
Got some top from a bitch named Tina, and Ringa
And you know I brought my nina, Katrina
I ain't show up for court subpoena
Now I got a warrant, I don't give a D-M, I'ma demon
Smoking on this stinky stinkar
What you smoking smelling like a bunch of dirty reefer
You might also like
I'm sitting at my mansion, cooling booling, smoking tooka
Niggas acting like they shooters, niggas really losers
Pull up on a nigga, click-clack, then I lose 'em
Skudda skuh, now they seen the cops, click-clack dulah duh, bang

Smoking tooka with my Ruger
My mothafucking Ruger got a ruler
Shoot this mothafucka at your lil medula
You ain't talking cash boy, you not cool

My Tec got a cooler-cooler
Shoot it at your damn medula-dula
I'm rolling with a bunch of killers, shooter-shooters
We pull up on your block and get to shooting you and you, nigga
Smoke, and we ride off smoke
Smoking on this too, Tutu I'ma fool
And I'm with my crew
And my son and Krue
We belong in the zoo
We some animals with some tools
Don't play with my fool, I remember being broke
Pull up to the show, with my fucking rolls
Catch ya at the stop sign, we gon' up these poles and blow, blow
Boy Jojo-Jo, 4-5 Ruger and a 4-O
I'm sitting at my mansion, cooling booling, smoking tooka
Niggas acting like they shooters, niggas really losers
Pull up on a nigga, click-clack, then I lose 'em
Skudda skuh, now they seen the cops, click-clack dulah duh, bang3Embed
