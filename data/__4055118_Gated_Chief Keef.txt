Court in Miami, they petty case me

Rock-a-bye Baby, my spot gated
Been had the Beamers, got a Mercedes
Rockin' the latest, bitch I'm the greatest
Bitch I upgraded, ayy, she Ace of Spade it, yeah
Never debate it, ayy, we get to sprayin'
It's 11AM, a nigga still up
Runnin' it up, ain't been to sleep once
I get it done, let's have some fun
Shootout your dread, now it's a bun
Boy when we come, you better run
What is to you, I am the one
Light up a spark, 'bout to walk in the park
RIP Dart, rip you apart
She don't like when it fart, I told her I do
Smokin' the goo, top of the coupe
Won't stop at you, actin' a fool
I see you fu', catch you with two
I got me a cup, but I don't sip deuce
Step down on the kush, I might get a Dually
I'm up with tooly, these niggas fruity
Dick in the booty, my pants is Ksubi
Boy's watch is foolish, bitch work at Hooters
They said I couldn't do it, tell 'em I do this
They boy alley-oop me, I shine like a ruby
More clips than a movie, I need a movie
I'm in the club makin' a movie
Thanks to my jeweler, ice like it's stupid
Try not to love me, she dodgin' a bullet
My ice have you woozy, like you off hookah
I didn't pay my shooter, I try not to snooze
When I say 'choo, fifty times two
Took her some' new, I'm wearin' some' new
She skatin' the coupe, okay new new

Diamonds on my chain make a nigga blind
Grab your bitch, hit her from behind

Pull up and dump, bricks in the truck

Me and Sosa ridin' in a foreign car, ayy
Drive the Lamborghini like a stolen car, ayy
Rollin' up gas out the cookie jar
Flexin' late, whip Mercedes, like a baby

Fuck you, pay me, nigga fuck you, pay me
