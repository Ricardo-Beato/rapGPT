11 ContributorsMake Yo Move Lyrics
Got to make that move
Go to make that move
Got to make that move girl

I know you seeing all this money I got on me
I know you staying over there, I know you want me
If your team get my team, girl it’s on me
What you gone do, got to make your move
Make that move, make that move
Make your move, what you gone do
Make that move, make that move
Got to make your move, what you gone do

Pull up in a McLaren, my diamonds are flaring, lil mama start staring
She looking at me and I’m looking at her and I like what she wearing
She made me want to run around, you just like an errand
No Halle Berry, no Jennifer Hudson, there ain’t no comparing
She walk around with that hair long to her booty crack
Girl you make me want to eat you up like a Scooby Snack
If you were playing basketball I’d hit your ass with that Shaq Attack
When I hit it from the back shawty act like a boomerang and she bring it back, boing-boing
Diamonds hit like Jackie Chan, chong-oing
I wanna take you home, wake up next to you in the morning
She popped a molly now all the sudden it snowing
She talk too much, annoying
You might also like
I know you seeing all this money I got on me
I know you staying over there, I know you want me
If your team get my team, girl it’s on me
What you gone do, got to make your move
Make that move, make that move
Make your move, what you gone do
Make that move, make that move
Got to make your move, what you gone do

Gave her 1000 dollars, cause the bitch so thick and she suck good dick
I don’t give a fuck about it, and I don’t miss shit and I don’t miss shit
Cause I be fucking balling, when I hit layin’ next, wanna have sex, fuck them niggas
Call me Gucci, you pay me 100 for a feature my nigga, Gucci gon come and get ya
Yea I'm the truth, Imma come and get you, but bring that money with you
You like graffiti, I don’t like fine art cause I’m a bigger picture
And matter fact, the way I ball, bitch I’m a motion picture
Your bitch got motion sickness cause we riding on 26s

I know you seeing all this money I got on me
I know you staying over there, I know you want me
If your team get my team, girl it’s on me
What you gone do, got to make your move
Make that move, make that move
Make your move, what you gone do
Make that move, make that move
Got to make your move, what you gone do1Embed
