No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no
No, no, no

Had me from the jump, can't tell a lie
Babe, you call a nigga up
Say you wanna say, "Hi"
And you need me
And I'm sick, I been waitin' now
My woman in the glowin' light, mm
See, I got things I'd like to show you, ooh

Take my heart, lady (Take my heart, lady)
If you fall, I will catch you, babe
Missed you long, honey (Missed you so)
Kiss you soft while I stroke it, babe
Open, you'll receive my love (Love, love)
As epic as can be, my drug (Yeah)

Fall into my arms
Let go, trust me
My God, I need your light
Babe, take me high up
Feel you in my bones, controllin' me
Yes, you're like a dream
You and everything that you be
You might also like
Will you take my heart, lady (Take my heart, lady)
If you fall, I will catch you, babe
Missed you long, honey (Missed you so)
Kiss you soft while I stroke it, babe
Open, you'll receive my love (Love, love)
As epic as can be, my drug (Yeah)Embed
