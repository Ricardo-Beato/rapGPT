3 ContributorsIn da Wall Lyrics(chorus)
Im gon get it hot money all up in da wall
Im gon get it hot chikens all up in da wall
Im gon get it hot money all up in da wall
Im gon get it hot chikens all up in da wall
Im gon get it hot money all up in da wall
Im gon get it hot chikens all up in da wall
Im gon get it hot money all up in da wall
Im gon get it hot chikens all up in da wall
I said im a real street nigga you can check my resume
I used to wake em up and break em down and now its everyday
They say ball till you fall, fall till your ballin
If you ain't got a caughtl yet this might be your callin
Uh oh der' it is show out
Walk strait up to that bitch and just pull your dough out and tell her just like this
I run this bitch
A lil money ain't nothing i burn this shit
(Repeat Chorus)
Look I need a ladder I got a million in my attic
I got a closet full of k's but thats only for the static
Swear a nigga crib like hes playin for the mavericks
I got green everywhere i can make a fuckin salad
They call me young double up i make it do what it do
Might have came here wit 1 but your leaving here wit 2
I got money in da wall, in da sofas and the dressers
And I keep my boy close in case these nigga's try to test us
