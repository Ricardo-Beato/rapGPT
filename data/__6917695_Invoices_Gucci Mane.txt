Wop
(d.a. got that dope)
Huh

Diamonds on my fist, got 'em wantin' to cut my wrist off (Brr)
Ballin' with the clique (Ball), it's Super Bowl, it's kickoff (Go)
Gucci to the kicks, so you should watch your bitch, dawg (Wop)
And when you see my bitch (Woo), you gon' cut your bitch off
Diamonds on my fist, got 'em wantin' to cut my wrist off
Ballin' with the clique, it's Super Bowl, it's kickoff
Gucci to the kicks (Gucci), so you should watch your bitch, dawg
And when you see my bitch, you gon' cut your bitch off

What a good feelin' when you know that you're thuggin' (Wop)
Whipping up the ****, and you know they gon' love it (Wop)
Slow motion on the oven while it's smokin' and bubblin'
Selling bags of the **** like the back of the Publix
Shawty thicker than a muffin, wanna fuck up a budget
All these hundreds in my pocket, had to throw her a hundred
Throwin' money 'til you vomit, got 'em sick to their stomach (I love it)
Red coupe, banana clip 'cause these niggas is monkey

Diamonds on my fist, got 'em wantin' to cut my wrist off (Brr)
Ballin' with the clique (Ball), it's Super Bowl, it's kickoff (Go)
Gucci to the kicks, so you should watch your bitch, dawg (Wop)
And when you see my bitch (Woo), you gon' cut your bitch off
You might also like
Green fur, red carpet, don't play for Boston (Gucci)
Went to Rome twice and they gave me an office (Bongiorno)
City on my back so long, that shit got exhausting (It's hard)
Sold the game to you and I charge you a bargain (Ch-ching)
Lemonade coupe, man, this shit color margarine (Coupe)
On MLK Drive, chance me flushing, ain't promising (A dream)
Lookin' like a lick, make my bitch catch a crush again (She crushin')
It's Woptober II and Guwop got that rush again (I'm rushin')

Diamonds on my fist, got 'em wantin' to cut my wrist off (Brr)
Ballin' with the clique (Ball), it's Super Bowl, it's kickoff (Go)
Gucci to the kicks, so you should watch your bitch, dawg (Wop)
And when you see my bitch (Woo), you gon' cut your bitch off
Diamonds on my fist, got 'em wantin' to cut my wrist off (Brr)
Ballin' with the clique (Ball), it's Super Bowl, it's kickoff (Go)
Gucci to the kicks, so you should watch your bitch, dawg (Wop)
And when you see my bitch (Woo), you gon' cut your bitch offEmbed
