6 ContributorsWhere I’m From Lyrics
It's nothin
P-R-P-R
A prefix bitch!
A street mix bitch
(I got my people with me)
One seven stand up
The ages behind like I always be, and the oval all brand but I'm from eagle Street, plaque the muddle of my mind, but I let the eagle speak
And say "die nigga die nigga die you come on the side"
I light the L after L shit, right cause I'm a G
You and L be jersey, tech9 and the see
But this ain't the three, it's the fuckin seventy and the heart still from Rat Rat pro
The off then off then off stay away from this block, the neighbor are calling
Your bitch come around believe me fuck him
She probably with the round and red and bubble
The F for fallen the v for vallen, varen and varen WI the la taken
I ain't no brave I'm just a young brave nigga from cross L


(P-town)
I got a fetish for dough, Cooking, stretchin’ the blow
Flood the set with the coke, trying to get my section to blow
Keep a Tech that’ll fold, extra vests when I roll
Now that I'm fuckin' with Wayne they respectin' the flow
Any section I go, if I'm there then it's home
I done been a lot of places but I’m Carrollton’s own
I be in and out of places but I’m there with the chrome, that’ll fell through your dome, your family had to bury your bones
