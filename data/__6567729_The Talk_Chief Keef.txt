Ayy, ayy (Sosa baby)
Ayy, ayy
Phew
Don't call my phone unless you trying to buy a whole brick, nigga
Phew, phew, phew

I've been in this shit, boy, you know I ain't no roody-poo
I just get my dick sucked, it ain't right she fufu
I just throw my sets up (Ayy), 24-1-4 (1-4)
Tell that nigga steppin' to me, hit him with the .44 (.44)
Diamonds from the North Pole (Bang), I see you looking, bro (Bang, bang, bang)
You in the trap with the crack, don't know how to cook it though (Skrr, skrr, skrr)
You spend your bands and your sack on some hooker hoes (Phew)
You post your guns and your set and your cookie dough (Phew)
Watch out, nigga, gang pullin' up (Skrrt)
I heard you dropped a couple songs, they ain't good enough (Nah)
I see you're hangin' with them goofies, they ain't hood enough (Huh)
I see you're trickin' on that bitch, boy, I wouldn't have (Go, go)
Ayy, I got a switchblade on the stick, I'll cut you up (Go)
Pussy actin' likе you rough, you ain't rough enough (Nah)
Shorty, I'm about my business, wherе the button up? (Bang)
Cops pulled up on the set, ain't no cuffin' us (Grah, bang, bang)
Pulled up in a truck (Skudaskur), what the fuck is up? (Skur)
Ten millies, man (Skudaskur), I urge you, nigga, fuck with us (Skur, skur, skur)

Like I owe the dope something, it got me coughin' up (Ugh, ugh)
Fuckin' with them hoes, you gon' get set up (Ayy)
We got fifty pipes (Ayy), we brought out the best ones (Ayy, gang)
It's pigs in your farm, pussy, Alabama (Huh, huh)
Baby Glock bit you like a fuckin' bed bug (Bang, bang)
I've been running shit, bitch, you see my leg numb (Bang, bang)
Your homie just died boy, keep your head up (Head up)
I remember when I pulled my first foreign car on Lamron (Lamron)
I remember selling dope on Dipset, Cam'ron (Cam'ron)
Don't do no deals around him, he might tell something (Shh)
Ayy, lil' bro, get low, I'm finna nail something (Bop)
Trunk his ass, kidnap him, full nelson (Skrrt, skrrt)
Lookin' for me, bitch? I'm grindin' on a rail, son (Skrrt, skrrt)
I got big .45 in my belt, son (Bang, bang, bang)
Thirty-four size jeans, big Amiris (Amiri)
Remember goin' downtown steal out Akira (Akira)
Now the Hellcat sittin' outside and it's gettin' rusty (Rusty)
Remember making BM buy me H&M (Ayy)
Hold the pussy upside down, now I'm shakin' him (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Cops got him in that room and they breakin' him (Pussy)
Ambulance took too long, it's too late for him (Go)
Baby say I'm the dog, get that awful lot (Huh, huh, huh)
And I'm sippin' cough syrup, yeah, awful lot (Huh)

Pussy boy, I am rich, your talk is not (Pussy)

If you ever see me, you gon' run up on me and goddamn get a handshake or something (Ayy, ayy), you wanna hold something, goddamn, I got you (Go, go, go, go)

Seent you outside the club, is you gon' get in? (Pussy)
Heard your fuckin' last album, boy, you need to stop
You didn't even do it right, it didn't need to drop (No)
Man, I'm tired of buyin' jewelry, man, I need some stock (Bling, bling, bling)
Wake up, take naps and go to sleep with guap
