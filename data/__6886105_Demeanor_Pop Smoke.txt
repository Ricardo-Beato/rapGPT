Ooh, oh
Oh (Baba treesha)
Oh

I'm flirtin' with your baba treesha
Shorty say she like my demeanor (Demeanor)
And she look like a eater (A eater)
I'm off the Perky geekin' (Geekin')
I'm flirtin' with your baba treesha
Shorty said she like my demeanor (Demeanor)
And she look like a eater (A eater)
I'm off the Perky geekin' (Geekin')

Wait, wait, oh, wait
Ooh, ooh

Fishbowl, send shots, bend blocks in the back (Yeah)
Earthquakes and selling cracks (No way), all my niggas into that
You send a shot, we send it back, all facts, no cap (None)
Put my hat to the back (Back), a hundred thousand in the bag
Look, eleven dollars a hour ain't enough to live (No)
So I'ma go in every store and I'ma swipe this shit (Yeah, yeah)
They try to lock a nigga up and I'm like, "Fuck a bid" (Fuck a bid)
'Cause either way, mommy still gon' love her kid (She gon' love him)
I just took a twenty from the city, they like, "Who is you?" (Who the hell?)
A lot of niggas talkin' shit that they don't really do (Ah, yeah)
I'm 'bout to turn my Air Force 1's into a Gucci shoe (Yeah, yeah)
I'm 'bout to turn my Timberlands into a Yeezy Boost (Oh)
My president black, bandana is blue (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Diamonds drippin', got me glistenin' like I came out the pool
I'm so exotic like I came out the zoo (No), but I shot out the coupe (No)
I got a scope with a clear eye view, woo (Yeah)

Female alpha
And I practice what I preach
I devour
Tell me, can you take the heat?
You can touch with your eyes only
I know you like what you see
That "Je ne sais quoi" energy
Baby, get on your knees
You can't say Pop without Smoke
So fill up your lungs, my diamonds'll make you choke
You like the way I move, my demeanor is meaner than yours
So clap for the encore
