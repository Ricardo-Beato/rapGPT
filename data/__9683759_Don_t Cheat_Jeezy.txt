7 ContributorsDon’t Cheat Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

Tell me you gon' hold it down, baby girl 'cause this shit ain't for the weak, nah
Real niggas don't cheat, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be out here gettin' paper while you sleep
Yeah, once again, baby (Once again)
'Cause real niggas don't cheat, nah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Open up a bottle of NAUD, let's count some paper (Paper)
Anywhere you want in this world, I wanna take you
Let's go and buy a couple acres out in Jamaica (Damn)
I'll be Bron, you be Kyrie Irvin', we'll be the Lakers
Real shit, been cheated on and I been lied to
Would've went to war 'bout them bitches, I would've died too (Aye)
Give it to her all on the counter, I let her ride to
Love it when she tell me to kill it, know I'ma slide too (Yeah)
Tonight you know I'm takin' my time, kiss on her neck (Neck)
Just watch your tone when you talkin' to me, it's about respect
We already three hours in, it's goin' down (Down)
Just know when you fuck with a king, you get a crown (Real shit)
You might also like
Tell me you gon' hold it down, baby girl 'cause this shit ain't for the weak, nah
Real niggas don't cheat, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be out here gettin' paper while you sleep
Yeah, once again, baby (Once again)
'Cause real niggas don't cheat, nah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You already gave me your heart, I want your soul (Soul)
See ain't nothin' comin' between us, yeah, that's the goal (Nah)
Like Magic Johnson and Cookie, yeah, that forever shit (Forever shit)
Right or wrong, you stand by your king, yeah, that Coretta shit (Aye)
In the world with no one to trust, know you can trust me (Trust me)
Just know that I'm stay on my shit, and make 'em lust me
And I ain't 'bout you playin' them games, I know my worth (Worth)
Some of these bitches ain't for the streets, they for the Earth (Damn)
Imagine me chasin' these bitches when I'm that nigga
Yamazaki with the big ice cube, don't chase my liquor (Nah)
Just know if a real nigga want you, then I'ma get you
Then we goin' out like Queen and Slim, you get the picture? (Real shit)

Tell me you gon' hold it down, baby girl 'cause this shit ain't for the weak, nah
Real niggas don't cheat, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be out here gettin' paper while you sleep
Yeah, once again, baby (Once again)
'Cause real niggas don't cheat, nah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh-huh, real niggas don't cheat, yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh-huh, yeahEmbed
