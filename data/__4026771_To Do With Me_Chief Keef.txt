8 ContributorsTo Do With Me Lyrics
Girl wait a minute, tryna see you, where you going?
See that I'm that nigga, that’s the only thing I'm knowing
Girl take a trip with me, 
Tell me that you love me, ain't got shit to do with me
Ain’t got shit to do with me, ain't got shit to do with me
Bugging me with questions, ain't got shit to do with me
Ain't got shit to do with me, ain't got shit to do with me
She love me because I'm reckless, ain't got shit to do with me

Now I got you and I see, where you going
 bust with shooters, 
My niggas move with me, for that money you will see
Hood make me who I be, I just stick to doing me
, fuck you pay me, no disrespect
But I'm full of disrespect, smoking loud and damn it’s cloudy
And they call me , 
Shawty saying she don’t smoke, I pass this loud, I bet she 
Man up in 
 shawty
Fuck on the other shawty
Ain't got shit to do with me, see my bro ain’t in it shawty

Girl wait a minute, tryna see you, where you going?
See that I'm that nigga, that's the only thing I'm knowing
Girl take a trip with me, 
Tell me that you love me, ain’t got shit to do with me
Ain't got shit to do with me, ain't got shit to do with me
Bugging me with questions, ain't got shit to do with me
Ain't got shit to do with me, ain't got shit to do with me
She love me because I'm reckless, ain't got shit to do with me

I'm on that 
She on the same 
She something special to me, she got her mind right

 till she started yelling 
She say I'm killing them, she talking competition
I hit her then I'm gone, baby girl there's no comitmant
Now loving, that's another story
She know I'm , that stuff is manditory
She say baby it's just you and me
I tell , ain't got shit to do with me

Girl wait a minute, tryna see you, where you going?
See that I'm that nigga, that's the only thing I'm knowing
Girl take a trip with me, 
Tell me that you love me, ain't got shit to do with me
Ain't got shit to do with me, ain't got shit to do with me
Bugging me with questions, ain't got shit to do with me
Ain't got shit to do with me, ain't got shit to do with me
She love me because I'm reckless, ain't got shit to do with me1Embed
