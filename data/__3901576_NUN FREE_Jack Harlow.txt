This a must
Ayy, this a must
Ayy, you a musty bitch

It's a must that I do my damn thing, I'm immune to all the fuss
I been hearin' that
Little bitch, what you starin 'at
Ayy, in the Grand Prix, you know I'm steerin' that, yuh
Fly just like a pterodact, yuh
Trying to ride the dick you know she steering that, yuh
Off course, she said do you love me, of course
Heard that shit you did is all for us
My girl cheated on me down in Gulf Shores
Ayy, spring break, twenty-twenty like the vision
Except the Left Eye, rest in peace, she up in heaven
And I'm with the bros, and we smokin' seven-eleven
Yeah that's gas bitch, you ain't felt the first impression
And I ain't gave it to you yet
Yeah they know I got a gift, yeah they say that I been blessed
If you feel some way about me, go 'head say it with your chest
I ain't worried 'bout a count, know she save it for the best
I got flavors and they fresh, come and see
I'm the one your boyfriend wanna' be
You might also like
I know when she say she wanna meet, she want the meat
I don't want the box, I just want the company
She get the fellatio, she want the cunnyling'
If they talk about us, just know it ain't come from me
Youngins in the city wondering
How I made it happen, you can do it too, now just believe
Just know that ain't nothin' free
Just know that ain't nothin' free
Just know that ain't nothin' free

I take random trips for no reason
I'm changin' my hoes every season
Hey, six a.m., sunrise beams me
Short lived 'cause a nigga slick sleepy
Three a.m., wit' the guys
Baddie up, she tell me slide
Coca-Cola, plus Henny nights
If you heard me once, probably said it twice
She asked me to Face Time, not tonight
She always complaining, I don't have the time
All I gotta do is pull up, lay the pipe
So dim the lights, hey, Marvin Gaye's playlist, no changes
Dunkin' in that shit like Calvin Cambridge, I tames it
Hey, young and tight, that shit amazin'
She jaded, had the three round she snoring crazy
Wake her ass up and go again is what I'm thinkin'
Ran through, shaky leg, uh
Fuck it, I'ma make a hit today, woah
Sorry I can't leave a tip today, uh
I might take more than a sip today, woah
I know when she say she wanna meet, she want the meat
I don't want the box, I just want the company
She get the fellatio she want the cunnyling'
If they talk about us, just know it ain't come from me
Youngins in the city wondering
How I made it happen, you can do it too, now just believe
Just know that ain't nothin' free
Just know that ain't nothin' free
Just know that ain't nothin' freeEmbed
