Goyard, oh, pick out what you want
Hermès, oh, pick out what you want
New Chanel, oh, pick out what you want
Poppin' tags, (808 Mafia!) I been poppin' tags

What the fuck is you talkin' bout, I can get ya ass hit
Hop out a Corvette nigga, then gon' smash ya bitch
I got American muscle nigga, I'm gonna hit me a lick
Sippin' on 'Tussin, fuckin' and hustlin'
I bet I'm gon' floss, hate it or love it
A full grown boss, hate it or love it
Dope boys shoppin' at Walters, I bought the whole store (Huh, huh)
Fuck boy doin' that talkin', that's my old hoe (Huh)
Stars inside the ceiling, I'm on go, go (Turn up)
You don't want no war, nigga, oh no (Huh)
Codeine floodin' Atlanta, bitch ass niggas with hammers
Bitch ass niggas in Pampers (Hold up), fuck around murk his mamma (Hold up)
My young niggas so playa, fuck around kill you in sandals
I was on some cool shit now they want the ana

King Jaffe Jo, my body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall (Super), now I think I'm seein' God (Woo)
You might also like
I been poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags (Yeah, yeah)
Poppin' tags (Hold up), I been poppin' tags (Super)
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags (Yeah, yeah)
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags (Huh)

I came here to purchase, I ain't worried 'bout a ticket
Bitch you want that G-Wagon? Go muthafuckin' get it (Ugh)
I had on my ski mask in the muthafuckin' trenches (Huh)
Homie Blood talking (Blood), is you muthafuckin' Crippin'? (Huh)
I get the plug talkin' 'bout these muthafuckin' chickens
Put up some lean, my Frank-a-lins
I run ‘em right through a machine (Brrrr)
I'm 'bout to lose the roof (Roof), they tryna steal the juice (Juice)
Cuban hangin' on my neck, whip on cruise
I just copped the Coupe, 63's with the Forgi's
Bought a couple 'Raris and I bought a couple Porsches (Vroom)
Zone Six fuck shit, finessin' and extorting (Gang)
Twenty diamond chains (Chains) and got seven different choices (Super)

King Jaffe Jo, my body wrapped in gold (Hold up)
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God

I been poppin' tags (Yeah), I been poppin' tags (Yeah, yeah)
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags (Super)
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags (Yeah, yeah)
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags (Hold up)
Goyard, oh (Oh), pick out what you want (Woo)
Hermès on, pick out what you want (Go)
New Chanel, oh, pick out what you want
Catch me goin' goon (Goon), smashin' on a womb (Womb)
Fuck your baby daddy, smash you on the Xanny (Huh)
Iced-out Kodaks, got you in your feelin's (Brrrr)
Just to get the feelin', spend a couple million
I go Godzilla in the Roley store, vroom, vroom
We just got the pack in from Mexico, vroom, vroom
Soon as it touch down I'm goin' ape, ooh, ooh
Put it on the hood like you claim Grape, mm (Gang, gang)
Pull up in the hood in a new Wraith

King Jaffe Jo, my body wrapped in gold (Hold up)
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God (Run up)

I been poppin' tags (Yeah), I been poppin' tags (Yeah, yeah)
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags (Huh)

Goyard, oh, pick out what you want
Oh, pick out what you want
Oh, pick out what you want
Catch me goin' goon, smashin' on a womb32Embed
