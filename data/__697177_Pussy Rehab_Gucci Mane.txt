Everyday I ball, what about you?
I hang on the block, body full of tattoos
I’m from the south side, what about you?
Middle finger in the air, I do what I do
Everyday I ball, what about you?
Everyday I ball, what about you?
I go to the mall, with my boo
I say you can get that, matter fact get two
‘Cause all I think about, is gettin' to the house
‘Cause I’m gon’ lick it out
Before I stick it in
A pocket full of Benjamins and all of ‘em dead
Pussy head pussy, pussy pussy head

I'm a duffle bag boy, so you know I get cash
I looked at shawty and I said I need that
It get so wet it started runnin' down her leg
I'm addicted to her love
I need pussy rehab

Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab

Never let a snitch nigga slide
Yellow diamonds like a cab, I don't need a ride
I'm rolling up this Larry kush to get me alive
Step my jewelry up, auntie said don't go outside
Serious, red diamond period, crazy color carrots
Cup cake curious, cup cake curious
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
I bought her a pistol, she bought me a bag
So icy boys, totin' duffle bags
I get so much pussy I should give pussy a break
Hit her from the back, sipping lean, blowing loud
She screamin' kinda loud, baby will you turn it down
Make her turn around
Hit it from the front, then I smoke a jawnt
It's my first day out the joint
Make her turn around
Hit her from the front, then I smoke a jawnt
Cause it's my first day out the joint

I'm a duffle bag boy, so you know I get cash
I looked at shawty and I said I need that
It get so wet it started runnin' down her leg
I'm addicted to her love
I need pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab

I’m tryna' crack her open, flip that ass like a spatula
Suckin’ on them titties, she gon’ think a nigga Dracula
Feastin’ on that ass, she gon’ think a beast attackin’ her
Slappin’ on that ass, she lookin’ back while I’m slappin’ her
Shawty make me bust quick, she already know that
Not because I can't hang, ‘cause her pussy so wet
Her pussy so wet, I think I’m drowning
Her pussy so wet, she let me pound it
Beat it up, beat it up
Hit it ‘til she aching
When I’m finish shawty gon’ need pussy rehabilitation
I’mma be the doctor baby, you can be my patient
And I’m always on call, I will never have you waiting

I'm a duffle bag boy, so you know I get cash
I looked at shawty and I said I need that
It get so wet it started runnin' down her leg
I'm addicted to her love
I need pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy pussy rehabEmbed
