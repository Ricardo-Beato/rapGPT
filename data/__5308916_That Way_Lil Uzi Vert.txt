I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way

But I don't wanna go out bad, wanna go out sad, wanna go out that way (No)
I'm with the winnin' team, they make sure I'm not in last place (Let's go)
If I wake up, don't make no money, that's a sad day (Woah)
Twenty-five hundred on my shirt what the tag say (Let's go)

I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way, woah
I want it that way

Woah, she from Atlanta, she went to Cascade, ayy (Let's get it)
She ride the D like she's tryna drag race (Woah)
Don't slow me right down, I like it fast-paced, ayy
That is enough about that girl, everyone know it is my world
If he dropped an album, thought it was trash day (Yeah, woah)
I'm on my own, not talkin' masturbate, yeah (Ew)
She gave me dome 'til I graduate, woah
I'ma grab a Bentley, Mean might go and grab a Wraith, yeah
I had to snap back into reality and go grab a fitted (Fitted)
My jeans, yeah, they fitted (Woo)
But Lil Uzi, he is so far from the timid (Let's go)
The reason I'm rich
'Cause I had to go and just fix my percentage (Let's go)
You know that I'm winnin'
My white girl got black card and it got no limit (Woo)

If I wake up, don't make no money, that's a sad day (Woah)
Twenty-five hundred for my shirt what the tag say (Yeah)

And I want it that way
I want it that way
I want it that way, woah
I want it that way

When I'm in DC, make the hoes go-go (Go)
Yes, I'm slimy like a snail, but I'm no slowpoke (Slow)
Only reason I didn't kick her out 'cause she gon' deepthroat (Yeah)
Hit it no protection, injection, yeah, this shit is lethal (Go)
They laugh at me because I'm emo (Yeah)
I killed my girlfriend, that's why I'm single (Fuck her)
Can't call 911 'cause I'm in Reno (Yeah)
Gave away my thumbs and I stood three toes (Let's go, let's go)
Diamonds hittin', bling, bling (Let's go)
Make the chopper sing, sing (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
He a killer (What?), same thing (Same thing)
Eyes low, Simmons, Ming (Yeah)
I don't wanna go out bad, don't wanna go out sad, not that way
I'm with the winnin' team, they make sure I'm not in last place (Yes)
If I wake up, don't make no money, that's a sad day (Why? Woah)
