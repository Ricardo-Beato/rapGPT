27 ContributorsGrown Man (2005) Lyrics
Yeah
What's up, baby?
I ain't tryna do nothing but get my grown man on
I ain't tryna hurt you
Only if you want me to
Haha
Yeah, something like that

Yeah, what's happenin', baby? I'm Lil Wayne from New Orleans
Fresh out the navy, now the captain of my own team
Hop in this machine, vanish from the scene
Goddamnit, I'm so mannish, handle it like a standard
So put your panties and your pants by the trash can
Romance on the floor plans, yeah
We hold hands while we rollin'
Just tryna keep up with the program
Just tryna sneak up on ya like, "How you doin', ma'am?"
I'm a old soul and a young man, we got to it and
We didn't stop 'til the birds hit the block
And she ain't never had it like that, haha

Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I
Could get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You might also like
Now I don't really hit the club, but tonight I'll make an exception
For some reason, I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction
I'm lookin' at you so hard, I could probably catch a charge
Feelin' the way you walk, when you move, your booty applauds
Damn, I gotta keep my composure
Gotta attack my mission, handle business like a soldier
Young man, Young Money, but the money long
Curren$y the Hot Spitta so grown (So grown)
And your perception of me is so wrong
Don't worry 'bout what you heard 'bout me and them other birds
Might have done a little dirt and left a few of 'em hurt
But whatever has occurred, they all got what they deserved, huh
And you don't rock like them, I can see it in your eyes
If you ain't good for me, then you wearin' a disguise
'Cause tonight, you lookin' like Miss Right
And I swore to be a player for life, but I'll change for you

Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I
Could get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
Yeah, you ain't a woman, you a baby girl living in a ladies' world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See, what I go through is what I owe you
So you should throw that ass back to me right now, yeah
Fly boy, baby, sit back, relax, and
Cruise with a nigga, destination satisfaction
Now whose is it, baby? She say, "Weezy Fuckin' Baby"
I say, "Yes in-fuckin'-deed," she say, "Don't you ever leave"
I say, I say, "But I got money on my mind"
Then I tell her never mind and we do it one more time, yeah
For a large amount of time
Long and won't stop 'til daytime come home, yeah

Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I
Could get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

Damn, look, haha
That, oh, that right there?
That's the sunset, girl
Get your visor
Where's those Chanel shades I get you?
You always losin' things
And I'm always buyin' new things, haha
I come a long way, huh? Remember, remember that block?
Look at you, you think you all grown, haha
You ain't a woman, you a baby girl living in a ladies' world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See, what I go through is what I owe you
And you should throw that ass back to me right now2Embed
