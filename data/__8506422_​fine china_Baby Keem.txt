Go sit in my diner, my cups is fine china
Where's your hair designer?
I'll pay her double, find her
I been swervin' traffic
What's the latest fashion
Whatever yo' favorite fabric
I just want you to get bracking
I just want you to get bracking
I just want you
I just want you to get bracking
Whatever you want, just ask me
I just want you to get bracking
I just want you
I just want you to get bracking
Whatever you want, just ask me

Talk about my last thing, my ex tryna catch me lackin'
Wouldn't do all these things for her
I like my women classy
I'll fill up your gas tank, no, I'm not your daddy
Took you to my first show, one day will be the GRAMMY's
Miss you more than one way, Chick-fil-A on Sunday
Two jobs on your plate, plate
That's one hour away, way
One ten minute break, break
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Just to see your face
Woah, woah, woah, woah
