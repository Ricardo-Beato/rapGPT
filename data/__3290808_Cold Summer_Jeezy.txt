19 ContributorsCold Summer Lyrics
Yeah
This for all the real niggas, man, you know
Woo, yeah (It's gon' be a cold summer)
Haha, yeah, woo, uh

Go and drop the top, you can feel the breeze
Thirty in the Glock, all you gotta do is squeeze
They just touched down, all you gotta do is sell 'em
And they gon' ask you questions, but you better not tell 'em
Hey, I'm 'bout to fuck it up, I'm bought in like ten
A couple bad tings and they all light-skinned
"Hey, how you comin' down?" In a rose gold Hummer
Wife beater chinchilla, it gon' be a cold summer

Got it snowin' in the city, I'm 'bout to change the weather
So many birdies in this bitch, thought I was seein' feathers
So many pussies hatin' on me, I just want the love
Hottest niggas in the city, me and Mr. Rugs
Them young niggas paper'd up, that's straight from water whippin'
Hey, between me and you, I think the water trippin'
Two-fifty in my pocket, I'm a walking lick
Went crazy at the lot, bitch, I'm a lunatic
My nigga Bleu got secrets he will never tell
Free Bale, yeah, you know he see me with the scale
Indicator like I'm Mike, I'm fucking 'round with Jody
One time for Raw Cena, that my fucking whodie
One time for Ross, go tell 'em free the G.O.A.T
Catch me in the 305, bitch, I'm on a boat
Got a hundred in my pocket, Free T. White
Two mill' on wheels and they all white
You might also like
Go and drop the top, you can feel the breeze
Thirty in the Glock, all you gotta do is squeeze
They just touched down, all you gotta do is sell 'em
And they gon' ask you questions, but you better not tell 'em
Hey, I'm 'bout to fuck it up, I'm bought in like ten
A couple bad tings and they all light-skinned
Ayy, bruh, pull up, what you in? In a rose gold Hummer
Wife beater chinchilla, it gon' be a cold summer

Get-get that cookie money, on my Oakland shit
Forty on a nigga, I'll blow this bitch
When I shoot, I don't miss, all net that bitch
Fuck her quick on the first night, I barely met that bitch (What's your name again?)
Too much money on me, bring that firepower (Bring that stick)
Knife on that chopper, they think Michael Myers got 'em (Grrah)
The rap fold, I'ma go platinum still
'Cause I put my deal money in the blow, crack and pills (In the blow, crack and pills)
I'm from Detroit, baby, this a wild city (The D)
Hop on at your block party and give that crowd fifty (Brr)
Ayy, Dex, when I hear that, "Huh," I know I hit him (I know I hit his ass)
I still fuck with Paid Will, Dada winnin' (What's up?)
Peezy and Pay, let's come together, this our city
Jeezy in the A, he fuck with Meech, that's our nigga
Rest in Peace to Great Lake ruler Darnell Lindsay (Blade)
Still hit the kitchen to whip, Chef Boyar-Grizzley
Detroit
Go and drop the top, you can feel the breeze
Thirty in the Glock, all you gotta do is squeeze
They just touched down, all you gotta do is sell 'em
And they gon' ask you questions, but you better not tell 'em
Hey, I'm 'bout to fuck it up, I'm bought in like ten
A couple bad tings and they all light-skinned
"Hey, how you comin' down?" In a rose gold Hummer
Wife beater chinchilla, it gon' be a cold summer2Embed
