20 ContributorsMighty Crazy Lyrics
You niggas gotta be outta your rabbit ass mind
A savage over this cabbage
You really think I'm finna let your faggot ass shine? (No)
Whipping niggas like big body Cadillacs
I'm on my grind, yo, bonafide honcho
I could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds
Matter of fact, I'm so bomb, niggas scatter that
Niggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto
My whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know
Shit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick
Survival's a bitch
But everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo
Wherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-0
God knows I don't put up no facade, no
No fraud, niggas scheming like Sideshow Bob
Keep my eyes so wide, nothing otherwise
Disrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh
From the other side, punk-ass nigga
Jump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk
Blast pop while I pump gas
Skunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath
My niggas will ride all day like a fun pass
That's some New York shit, I'm from the south, though
Don't never disrespect me out yo mouth, ho
I got major clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful
You talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outroYou might also like3Embed
