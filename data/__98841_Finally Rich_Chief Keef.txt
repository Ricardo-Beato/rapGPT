65 ContributorsFinally Rich Lyrics
Catch up, Catch up
Ohh what's up, Sosa
Chief Keef is outta prison
Nigga, bitch nigga it's cracking
Bitch nigga it's cracking
You ain't 'bout that action, bitch nigga
'Cause he is out of the prison
Go on his Facebook page motherfucker
Free Sosa, Sosa baby, catch up
Free my nigga Sosa, he out the jail
I ain't know none of these niggas
3Hunna, fuck you mean nigga
Shout out to Fredo Santana
Imma do a mixtape with y'all called "Ran My Bands Up"
Let's get this cash man
3Hunna, nigga

(Young Chop on the beat)
And I love all my fans
Without y'all I wouldn’t get far
All these niggas follow my campaign
All these bitches know my name

I know I'm finally rich
But ain't a damn thang gon' change (No)
Me and my boys still bang (Bang-bang, O'Block)
We'll clap a nigga up no range (Bang)
