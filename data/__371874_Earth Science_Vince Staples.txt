Bitches born with shovels
Guess that devil in disguise make you more than a woman
Felt the anger in your eyes since the moment I hugged you
Seemed familiar like a look in the mirror
You took a chance, and I appreciate it
Understand that over time, my word depreciated
But we can do it all again, waiting for you to say when
Give it time and a place, swear to God I'll attend
I should've took you to promâ€”fuck whoever had did
But I was busy punching niggas in the face by the gym
And you was right there
You was always right there
Forwarding your calls thinking, "How we got here?"
Heh

But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
No, I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
You might also like
Remember walking to your house every day of the week
Nothing else I had to do, and you was something to see
Red rose tattooed right up under your jeans
Still text you every night before I wander to sleep
Never told you this, but you was why I went to seventh period
Truant student, but you told me I should take it serious
Losing you is just another demon that I'm living with
Standing in your living room, meeting your fam'
Know it hurt you when they ask you, "What had happened to him?"
When you see me on the TV, know I'm glad you my friend
Wish I had more, but I don't
Never running out of hope
Really, I'm just waiting on you

But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
No, I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you

As for you, I always think about our kids that you killed
Understanding at the time, you didn't think we was real
But as a man, I feel I let you down
We was on our second child that you seen as a mistake before I got to reconcile
And make you see the way I'd try to plan for us all
When I look back at my life, I'm glad I had you involved
If I ever need somebody, you the first I'ma call
Said that you would do it all just to see me alive
In the back seat, Seal beats, tears in your eyes
Told me they was tears of joy, still I think that's a lie
But whatever helped you walk in faith, you couldn't when you walked away
Sorry if you called me and I tell you, "I can't talk today"
Pain in my voice when I speak in these songs
Same tone as the day I told you leave me alone
But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
No, I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said9Embed
