10 ContributorsJesus Was a Stoner Lyrics
Jesus was a stoner, uh-huh
Born in Southern California, uh-huh
Lying out on the corner, uh-huh
While they're tryna stone us, uh-huh
You wanna stone us, you wanna stone us
Come on stone us
They wanna stone us, they wanna stone us
Come on stoners

I'm called the weed messiah, grab your lighter
You're transfixed with the spliff and your lips higher
Like smoke rises, your sex is heightened
Inhale, embrace Mary, but don't be frightened
I bring the God flower, uplift the people
Holy sacrament communion, take and let me feed you
No superstitions or crucifixions or false prophets
Crosses burnin' in my hand, call it burned object
Smoke gathers like holy masses
Take a hit, pass it to the left, it's in the passage
You know my disciples, this is a new revival
Judas rose and took the soil to enrich the cycle
Smoking Mother Earth, blessed is the herb
Mother Mary save us, thankful for what you gave us
Roll it in my papers, share it with my neighbors
High as skyscrapers, a cult of cultivators
We got the multitude, our sisters and our brothers
How I break my bread like it's the last supper
I'm the blood of stoners, I'm the higher after
Believe me, elevate, hear the sounds of laughter
You might also like
I be the greenest rapture
Stoner Jesus with the cleanest shatter
Sum of demons, that's some genius banter
Get the screen capture
If you perceive this as some needless chatter
You need to heed the Stoner Jesus chapter
I be the greenest rapture
Stoner Jesus with the cleanest shatter
Sum of demons, that's some genius banter
Get the screen capture
If you perceive this as some needless chatter
You need to heed the Stoner Jesus chapter
