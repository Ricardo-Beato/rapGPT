5 ContributorsNew Jack Lyrics
Huh
Aw who this is?
Who is this?
Nigga this Chief So Nigga
Aw I ain’t know that was you my bad, I swear I ain’t know that was you bro
Fuck up Nigga, punch you in yo fuckin teeth Nigga, slap the shit out you Nigga
It’s Sosa Nigga, turn up!
Aye man, get the money

It’s 2020, I still got that cash in
Shred that paper up and hand me the trash bin
I taught you how to cash out, how to cash in
With a Mac Benz, got rid of my bad friends
Talking this and that, pick out ya casket
Sipping Easter pink, picking out a basket
Shot 3, you know I had to get me a basket
Gun got extended on it like a hatchet

Pull up vandalizin'
Man these pussy Niggas need to stop scandalizing
We got guns like the Kamikaze
Nigga we’ll hit yo video and get to flashing at the camera posse
You might also like
Told that bitch the only flowers that I want, is the Murakamis
Yeah we coming
Pull up you know I got the steel that’ll scare a zombie
Nah this ain’t a horror film, but you might see me killing zombies
Aye
And I just wrapped up the little lamb, now you call this Bitch a mummy
Please don’t test me lil Nigga, I’ll spill ya shit cuz I’m clumsy
Call Skateboard P and tell him thanks man, 'cause Human Races comfy
Got me out the house for some bullshit, now I’m on yo block in a fucking onesie
And it was 2010, and we was already screaming, “Nigga Fuck your homie!”
I’m driving up yo street in some slippers, if I catch you, you’se a fucking slipper
And I’m a smooth cat, you a rat, we don’t got the same fucking whiskers
You creeping down my block you better have your inside voice and fucking whispers
I’m coming with a fan, and he’s tryna bother you for a fuckin' picture

Ayy, goddamn
Made it 24, they ain’t think that I could do that
Nah I been a young Nigga, I was hanging with the cool cats
Damn girl you just grabbed my gun, why the fuck you just do that?
If that Bitch was off safety, Bitch you could’ve Damn near just blew that
And if you knew better, you already know, you would do that
And you said you want me to be ya man, but baby I can’t do that
Coming down the street in a Lamborghini, bitches like who that?
(Who is that?)
I’m in the back of the Maybach and I’m watching Orange hit New Black
And I just left VA and I got me a new gat
And nah we don’t rock with Ninos, Nigga you can get New Jacked
Oh it’s a hundred of yall?
L.A.C.K., it’s a group pack
You know I don’t need no bodyguard
Me and gang will make yo ass scoot back
The 9/11 just took the top from me
I’m tryna see if I can get my roof back
And you know we catching shit, we don’t give a fuck about who pass
Switch from the truck to the car, you would think I had a coupe pass
Need me a F150 just to ride it pass yo broke ass1Embed
