Take what you want
Take everything
Take what you want
Take what you want

Better that I change my number so you can't explain
Violence in the night, violence in the night
Priors, priors, do you have any priors?
Well, that one time
I'll be honest, I'll be honest
We all liars
Let it go

I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?

Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight

Don't you curse at mе on text, why you try to hit the flex?
I hold up, likе, "What?"
I scroll, I scroll up like, "Next"
Guess who's getting 'exed?
Like, next
Guess who's getting 'exed?
You made a choice that's your bad, single life ain't so bad
But we ain't finna go there
Something's off, I'll tell you why
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
What a grand plan to sell you out
I could scream and shout, let it out

I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?

Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight
God in my cells, that's my celly
Made in the image of God, that's a selfie
Pray five times a day, so many felonies
Who gon' post my bail? Lord, help me
Hol' up, Donda, I'm with your baby when I touch back road
Told him, "Stop all of that red cap, we goin' home"
Not me with all of these sins, castin' stones
This might be the return of The Throne (Throne)
Hova and Yeezus, like Moses and Jesus
You are not in control of my thesis
You already know what I think 'bout think pieces
Before you ask, he already told you who he think he is
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think precincts
I can't be controlled with programs and presets
Reset
On my cell, in my cell tonight
Don't have to see you to touch you
This is what braille look like, it's on sight
If they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her send my mail
We know what Hell look like
Still, it's a hell of a life, yikes

Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight80Embed
