8 ContributorsBreak Down Lyrics
Started in the hood hustling
Started in the hood struggling
Started in the hood juuging

Here’s a little story bout a nigga from the A-Town
Smoking up the Crest, holding the gas,and the break down
Multimillionaire but man I started from a break down
If you buy a dime, sell it for 20, it’s a break down
If you buy a dub, make you two dubs, that’s a break down
If you buy a brick, make you two bricks, that’s a break down
Dimes bigger than a giant Now and Later, break down
Rims and tires never drove a mile, it won’t break down

You hear da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, that’s what you’re hearing
Fuck you niggas and the police, who you fearing
I’m a west coast down south nigga, all in one
On a motherfucking mission, I ain’t leaving ‘til I’m done
Man these niggas kind of fake now, ready for that shake down
Niggas popping shit, that AK, yeah how that sound?
I’m that nigga Daz, I fuck with Guwop
Try to be something you’re not, nigga need to stizzop
Bout that money money money money, that’s what you can die from
Lot of niggas die for nothing cause they didn’t have none’

Here’s a little story bout a nigga from the A-Town
Smoking up the Crest, holding the gas, and the break down
Multimillionaire but man I started from a break down
If you buy a dime, sell it for 20, it’s a break down
If you buy a dub, make you two dubs, that’s a break down
If you buy a brick, make you two bricks, that’s a break down
Dimes bigger than a giant now and later, break down
Rims and tires never drove a mile, it won’t break down

Blow a kiss to your main bitch, watch her break down
She be like all you do is work, take a break now
Tell that bitch put that ass up with the face down
Same ho that we used to shone rappers date now
Fuck it bro, you be cuffing though, put your cape down
Fuck with me, she just want the D, shout to 8 Mile
Same clown, say they losing weight, out of shape now
Hey now, I got hella birds, think I’m A-Town
Can’t count, all this fucking gwap in my PayPal
All I want for Christmas a 380 and a tre pound

Here’s a little story bout a nigga from the A-Town
Smoking up the Crest, holding the gas,and the break down
Multimillionaire but man I started from a break down
If you buy a dime, sell it for 20, it’s a break down
If you buy a dub, make you two dubs, that’s a break down
If you buy a brick, make you two bricks, that’s a break down
Dimes bigger than a giant now and later, break down
Rims and tires never drove a mile, it won’t break downEmbed
