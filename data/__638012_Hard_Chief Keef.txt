She don't accept me, but she speak to my watch, ayy
She won't regret me, when she let me fuck, ayy
She won't look at me, but she see I go hard
I had to put my Beamer in park
I pull up on the house and she want it hard
She hop up on me and then she ride it hard
Then I go outside and keep grindin' hard

It ain't my boys, then I don't give no fuck
It is, then I will give a fuck
Money ain't that much, I'll give it up
Pull up, give 500 to a cluck
Life ain't that much, I'll live it up
I'll just get a blunt, I'll fill it up
Hop up in my Beamer, I'll fill it up
Everybody eatin', I'll bill it up
Baby I'll keep my mouth closed, I'll seal it up
I won't lie to you, I'm real as fuck
You might also like
She don't accept me, but she speak to my watch, ayy
She won't regret me, when she let me fuck, ayy
She won't look at me, but she see I go hard
I had to put my Beamer in park
I pull up on the house and she want it hard
She hop up on me and then she ride it hard
Then I go outside and keep grindin' hard

I'm all about my fetty, Sosa Pi√±ata
And fuck if she let me, then I been by her
I spend by her, I went by her
I fucked on her, and I flexed on her
I love Beamers and Bentleys, 'member dreamin' of them
Now I can hop in any, and be speedin' in them
She mad cuz my boys always with me, and I'm bleedin' with them

She don't accept me, but she speak to my watch, ayy
She won't regret me, when she let me fuck, ayy
She won't look at me, but she see I go hard
I had to put my Beamer in park
I pull up on the house and she want it hard
She hop up on me and then she ride it hard
Then I go outside and keep grindin' hard6Embed
