6 ContributorsLil Mexico Lingo Lyrics
I got 31,000, Mexico lingo
Future sellin dope, that's that Mexico lingo
10 on an auti, Mexico lingo
You not an astronaut, that's the Mexico lingo

If you say 100, I say a thousand
When you got the racks like me, the money keep pilin
I don't write in the booth, I'm just freestylin
When your lingo turn up, you can freestyle it
Most of my niggas draped up, like we from the islands
With these Freebands, Imma try to buy an island
Flyer than a pilot, and the co-pilot
Yeah, that's gotta be me

I got 31,000, Mexico lingo
Future sellin dope, that's that Mexico lingo
10 on an auti, Mexico lingo
You not an astronaut, that's the Mexico lingo

Keep that gun with me, I got that heavy
Luie on my luggage, I keep the automatic
Snackin on swag, I see you niggas try to snatch it
Gigantic, Titanic, my diamonds wet like the Atlantic
Geronimo swaggin, I see you got paneramic
The world is FBG, young Future copped the planet
Black boy, white boy, all them niggas got me talkin spanish
Holy Guapomoli, speak so well, you can't understand it
You might also like
I got 31,000, Mexico lingo
Future sellin dope, that's that Mexico lingo
10 on an auti, Mexico lingo
You not an astronaut, that's the Mexico lingo

That Mexico lingo, see them niggas tryna steel it
They watchin and observin,they see the hoes dig it
Anything Scooter say, probably worth a million
Finnessin like a fool, racks taller than a building
My Migos, my friends, all we do is talk millions
Casino, Future, and Mexico Ran gettin it
In love with money, I just can't stop gettin it
Freebands all day, that's the only way we livin

I got 31,000, Mexico lingo
Future sellin dope, that's that Mexico lingo
10 on an auti, Mexico lingo
You not an astronaut, that's the Mexico lingoEmbed
