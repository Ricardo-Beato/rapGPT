40 ContributorsGlory Bridge Lyrics
Ness on the beat

All fly shit I used to go to school like this
“Off-White” kicks my shoelaces say shoelaces (Yeah)
Orange tiger on my shirt I'm in some Gucci shit (Yeah)
She keep lying on my dick she on some hoochie shit (Yeah)
We pull up in 20 Rari's on some movie shit, yeah
I will never say I'm sorry to a goofy bitch, yeah
Slide up on her drop her off and let my goony hit, yeah
You a dirty little thot, you little stupid bitch

Bitches in my phone taking space up, yeah
No I can't be lacking got my face up, yeah
Drip more purple than a Laker, yeah (esketit)
Eyes more red than a laser, yeah
Faces on me bigger than fantasias, yeah
Shakespeare on a bitch named Anastasia, yeah
You can get her back, I'm not a saviour, yeah
Rolling on your exes, Charles Xavier, yeah
I ain't got no service call me later, yeah
Ridin right past all me haters, yeah
I done spent rope on me laces, yeah
Feds got us on they papers trynna trace us, yeah
Marshall Law with the moves, Tekken
Ball with my brodies been with them since AND1
Bitch you ugly you and yo friend can't come
Motor make a hood hop, huh J-Kwon
She know I got more sauce than A1
Supposed to be at the gathering at 1
Sean Carter bag, I'm trynna catch one
She think I'm cute, top me quick, it was a fast one
You might also like
She wanted me to clean her mess but I got on Hermes, yeah
She tried to catch me on her snap before I got undressed, yeah
If I don't pull up in all black, I'll pull up in all red, yeah
30,000 on a rollie, my lil' bitch a brat, yeah
I'm in my bag now I'm odee, yeah
I ain't never had no OG, yeah
I get money, it ain't lowkey, yeah
Hit her once and then I proceed, ayy
And I can't picture bein' broke these days
She gave me head I told her don't breathe, ayy
If you love her nigga don't sneeze, ayy
She was covered up in codeine, ayy
You a aunty you a dope fiend, ayy
Don't get too close if you don't know me ayy
I chill with shottas chill with proteges ayy
Red bottoms like a nosebleed, ayy4Embed
