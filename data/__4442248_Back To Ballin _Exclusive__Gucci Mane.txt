5 ContributorsBack To Ballin (Exclusive) Lyrics
Gyeah
Gucci
Gucci
Zaytoven on the track
Your boy Gucci Mane La Flare back at it Mane
Zay got another one nigga
Talk to ´em Gucci

S-550 built just like a spacecraft
Blue pinky ring cost me double brick fare
Sick wrist game like ones two pals
Two pills fifty bricks
I´ll be right back
Half a mill vacuum sealed, that´s a nice sack
Half a mill just on pills, that´s a big pack
Quarter mill out the stash, then right back
Bought  with diamonds, you like that?
Gucci Mane on Bentley show
Then get the mic back
Chopped up your knew buddy, cause he did invite 
Cognac mixed with sprite, shit yeah I like that
Put this dick in her mouth, she won´t bite that
Put three pills in her drink, watch her swallow that
Fucking front seat of a Bentley, bitch you like that
Three pills in her drink, watch her swallow that
Fucking front seat of a Benz, do you like that
You might also like
Coca Cola, baking soda, water
The 4-12 hit the door
Flush it down the toilet
Swag south northern
My grill looking 
Six month lost it
Now it´s back to ballin
Coca Cola, baking soda, water
4-12 hit the door
We gon´ flush it down the toilet
Swag kind of northern
My grill looking 
Six month I lost it
Now it´s back to ballin

Sun Valley apartments I put it down
Catch me in the kitchen trying to get that shit a turnaround
Splash it with the water just to cool it down
Catch me in Sun Valley trying to get this shit a turnaround
 now we finna burn it down
 is a new kid in town
O.J. must have  and 24s
He´s selling yayo when he got nowhere to go
Used to sell them units at the 
Big old diamonds that were bigger than your elbows
Dope man Nikes not no 
He ain´t got the money
Why the fuck you call my metro
Dodge him and charge him on them 
Gucci Mane La Flare I ain´t checked a nigga no way
Breaking down a forty on the 5 way
A lot of purple vets when you pulled in my driveway
Coca Cola, baking soda, water
The 4-12 hit the door
Flush it down the toilet
Swag south northern
My grill looking 
Six month lost it
Now it´s back to ballin
Coca Cola, baking soda, water
4-12 hit the door
We gon´ flush it down the toilet
Swag kind of northern
My grill looking 
Six month I lost it
Now it´s back to ballin

I retired my pen
I don´t like shit
Put ´em in the trap with a truckload of white shit
Damn
It really white like the 
Gucci Mane La Flare you´re cooking up
You get thick
Put it on the floor and 
How to get thin
Shawty charging 8.5
Gucci charges 10
If you get 10
8.5 if you spend
Twice in a day
Double that times a trey
4 way to 5 way
Call white shawty
I ain´t got no where to go
Units units
Get to it to it
Got a nine in the pot
Atta do it do it
Light on them Dickies
Heavy on the Gucci
Light on the Wrangler
Heavy on the Luis
Catch me in the boof
Trying to drop an Exclusive
 belt I ain´t calling same color as my groupies
Coca Cola, baking soda, water
The 4-12 hit the door
Flush it down the toilet
Swag south northern
My grill looking 
Six month lost it
Now it´s back to ballinEmbed
