5 ContributorsAll Alone (No One to Be With) LyricsAll alone, no one to be with (in the background throughout the song)

As a youth, each Sunday, Dawn went to Church and
Paid her respects and not to mention was a virgin
Kid pushed up, Dawn lettin' him
Since he made her laugh and all the other girls was sweatin' him
Then things started to move without pause
And a couple o'months later kid's pushin' for the drawers
Under pressure while exchangin' glances
Dawn finally gives in to the sexual advances
Although it was a mad high cost for her
Cuz' after the thrill was gone, so was the lust for her
Eventually he left her for another
Now feeling alone and betrayed by her lover
She cried--for no longer knew which way she headed
Once dreamed of actually wearing white at her wedding
And really being pure, now she thought she'd die without
Still she finds strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Without love...
Without love...
Without love...

Verse two of Dawn's life--the second segment
What could be worse than to now find out you're pregnant?
Poor Dawn couldn't sleep--laid awake
Not ready for a child and plus her mother's gonna break
And she doesn't know how she's gonna bring up the subject
Consequences of being used as an object
In church though time's runnin' thin
She decides to have the child because she doesn't want to sin
Props to the girl although ahead hard times;
It was Hell finishin' school and working part-time
Yet Dawn did it though her youth went to waste
Little help from the government, she got her own place
HARD for an independent woman and a kid
And as soon as she could get off the assistance, she did
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continue with her life without love...

While Dawn worked two jobs tryin' to meet ends
Her son was busy cuttin' school and hangin' with his friends
So when she got words she tried to slap out the taste in his mouth
And explain how important education is
Under stress, she takes two Bufferin
Son now tired of seein' his poor mother sufferin'
Starts to sell drugs though the cops did a raid
Guess who's in the mix, and being legal age
Could do time, please call her employer
To inform her that her son is gonna' need a lawyer
Never no good news, just more strife
Dawn barely havin' enough time to live her own life
Hears the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'
Now spends nine hours on the bus to go and see him
Here's the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'
Now spends nine hours on the bus to go and see him
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continues life without love...Embed
