Dealin' with everybody's opinion, tryna do me
Only down one, I'm in the final, shootin' threes like I don't give a fuck
Music, we fuck and switch the position up
We love the things that keep on bringin' out the kids in us
Been workin' all my life to do some different stuff
And people have the nerve to say I'm young and haven't lived enough
I'm on the road, my girl so sad I'm gone
It's hard when I can't even find the time to call my mom
And she thinks I'm goin' Hollywood, I guess she probably should
It seems like people see the bad and don't acknowledge good
I feel the shade, but I can see the sun, I'm cool
I've got the time, but feel the need to run, a fool
Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb
Been spendin' cake to get some bump in the trunk
Drums with a pump like some Reeboks, see me from the treetops
They worry, but they need not, heatin' like a teapot
Now I think I'm cool 'cause I got a pair of shoes
And mo' dough, a jacket with a Polo logo
My cup always filled with Henny, so no Fo' Loko
But they should know, so, ha
I could go slow, you see that I'm smooth now
Used to ignore me, they study what I do now
With some help from Kweli, and it's Like on the Beat
It's cool to say that my cypher complete
You might also like
Word
I'm so sick with the verbs I use, the words that heal us
They love how we kill it on stage, man, Murder theaters
No wonder they call it a bunk, I sleep in a coffin
Dead tired, exhausted from how often I be tourin'
So gangsta, like the occupation of Made Men
Creatin' chaos, my operation is Mayhem
The movie never stopped, the frame change over
We added Mac to the wolfpack, Hangover
That Hen is not a friend, I'm on that Lagavulin
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man
You not a kid no more, no one to hold your hand
And Four Loko make your shoulder lean like a Dro fan
Go ham, like Abraham readin' all the Psalms
Oh yeah, and don't forget to call your moms
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year
Take care of the fam, 'cause it's all we really have here4Embed
