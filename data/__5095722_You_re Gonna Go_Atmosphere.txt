10 ContributorsYou’re Gonna Go Lyrics
I don't where you're gonna go
But I know you're gonna go
I don't where you're gonna go
But I know you're gonna go

Got a pocket full of pockets
But caught between your soft lips
Good morning, a clear blue sky
But by the time the storm arrived it was like a category five
You know we had to keep the story all the way live
And though I never meant to draw any blood
I wasn't innocent, I had a little dirt in my eye
And I would drown in a flood just to cover my mud
And I ain't saying that we not genuine
I'm just looking at the product you're peddling
I stopped following the mess you kept stepping in
I got my own problems to wrestle with
Now wait a minute, I'm not afraid to admit that I loved her
I guess I'm just a sucker for fuckers
I'm not a victim, I'm not a victor
I'm trying eavesdrop when the cosmos whisper

I don't where you're gonna go
But I know you're gonna go
I don't where you're gonna go
But I know you're gonna go
You might also like
And I don't recollect if I detected the warnings
The sex was rewarding, the fights got boring
It might sound corny but you a freak for control
It seemed likely the right time for me to get old
I knew you that were still feeling me but knew
You probably willingly fantasized about killing me, too
So tell me what the hell did you expect me to do?
That's why I never said bye and never checked in with you
It never connected that you'd eventually find me
Nothing that suggested you'd even come looking
But I guess I should be flattered, and if I could stand up
It wouldn't even help free myself from these handcuffs
There's probably not a lot left to say
We depend on the infliction, addicted to the way we get away
And even those of us that's afraid of the waves
Gon' still play a role in digging our own graves, you gotta go (Hey)

I don't where you're gonna go
But I know you're gonna go (Oh, woah)
I don't where you're gonna go
But I know you're gonna go

Well, I don't know where you're gonna go
But I know you're gonna go
I don't know where you're gonna go
But I know you're gonna go
I don't know where you're gonna goEmbed
