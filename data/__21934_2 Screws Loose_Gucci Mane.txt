9 Contributors2 Screws Loose Lyrics
Them niggas is gangsters, them niggas is Shady
Them niggas got screws loose, them niggas is crazy
Walk around with they boots loose, tuckin 380's
Standin in the trap screamin fuck you pay me

Nigga I'm one-seven-five wet, movin like Deebo
Boxcutter like a nigga work at Home Depot
Rep for my people, a big Desert Eagle
Shootin' at your bucket like a Marbury free throw
Bitches get nothin, zilch I mean zero
Tommy gun sprayed at them niggas playin' hero
Niggas in the hood don't peep through no peephole
Cameras and motion scanners, try to creep ho
Most of us iced out, some don't even rock jewels
They in the club for a purpose, and that's to bang the tool
Street smart, I'm far from that college dude
Love gettin good brains, bitches give me knowledge fool
It don't take much, a little weed and the dutch
Couple sips of that Remy, now she wanna fuck
Hoes see a nigga chain swingin wanna touch
Rocks used to be cubed up, now my shit is crushed

My pack came in, I want seventeen-five for 'em
Bricks go down when you get more than five on 'em
Bck in '98, I was holdin that 'tel down
2006 and now we're breakin them bales down
Gucci you the shit, least that what they told me
Catch me in the 6 a nigga right where the shoals be
I fronted you a nine so five what you owe me
If you don't pay me then it's back to the old me
Coca√≠na same color the snow be
Haters get found in the Okefenokee
You trap that's cool, I trapped since school
I'm trappin boo, but I'm rappin too
Not a role model, hit that purp
I'm not a role model little shorty rep your turf
I'm not a role model, hit that purp'
I'm not a role model young nigga cook that work
