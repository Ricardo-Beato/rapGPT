65 ContributorsSeven Rings Lyrics
Yeah, I told 'em
I told 'em if it's a problem, say it's a problem
I told you off the top that I was solid
I told you we get money by the pillow
I told you half of these niggas with me win now

My left and right hand Robert Horry
Most my niggas pop Xans unemployed
I can't stop, I'm goin' in, steroids
I tried to tell you when I came, it was God
I'm washin' off my hands with the mula like it's Ajax
Sippin' out my cup, hell no, don't you taste that
Hundred percent chance I done doped up and laced that
Chillin' with my family, hangin' low, I embrace them

20 different strippers, money double, triple
Started off slizzered, they callin' me The Wizard
Valet got that Porsche, Casino got that Porsche
Killers all I know, fill 'em up with the dough
You know I'm on that syrup, about to send the word
Do niggas really argue? Who gon' shoot you first
Fatface wanna do you, Blade wanna do you
This bitch from Guyana, layin' low with that hammer
Try not to fuck her on camera
I pray that my young nigga don't kill you on camera
You come too close, nigga, I'ma have to kill you on camera
I hate to discuss it
If Bubba don't trust you, nigga, you know I don't trust you
You might also like
My left and right hand Robert Horry
Most my niggas pop Xans unemployed
I can't stop, I'm goin' in, steroids
I tried to tell you when I came, it was God
I'm washin' off my hands with the mula like it's Ajax
Sippin' out my cup, hell no, don't you taste that
Hundred percent chance I done doped up and laced that
Chillin' with my family, hangin' low, I embrace them

Heater on your side, it's a hundred percent chance
Some of these people by my side is straight up out the can
We come from the bottom, upper echelon
I came here to serve you, need some cash on delivery
I just hope she washed her mouth out before you kiss her
My downtown bitch said, "Did you heard me?"
I think she stays five minutes from Bourbon
I had an Arizona plug, used to serve me
I throwed that money in the bag cause it was dirty
He got that chopper on him now and he hurtin'
I know he 'bout to let it go and that's for certain
I know he 'bout to let it go and that's for sure

My left and right hand Robert Horry
Most my niggas pop Xans unemployed
I can't stop, I'm goin' in, steroids
I tried to tell you when I came, it was God
(I tried to tell you)
I'm washin' off my hands with the mula like it's Ajax
Sippin' out my cup, hell no, don't you taste that
Hundred percent chance I done doped up and laced that
Chillin' with my family, hangin' low, I embrace them
Told 'em if it's a problem, say it's a problem
I told you off the top that I was solid
I told you we get money, by the pillow
I told you half of these niggas with me win now

My left and right hand Robert Horry
My left and right hand Robert Horry
Plus my nigga pop Xans unemployed
I tried to tell you when I came, it was God30Embed
