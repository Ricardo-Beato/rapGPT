30 ContributorsWho Do You Love? Lyrics
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me

Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggas, slangin' drugs
And runnin' from the narcs when they pass by, don't ask why
I'm a hustler, 'til my ass die
Even if I do come up, I'll be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all
Fuckin' with them tramp-ass sluts who supposed to fall
Said she played you for your money, but the shit was cool
Guess it's true, niggas be bitches too
You can't see how she worked you all up in the skirt
Now you lookin' like a jerk 'cause she hurts you
Now hands up, don't be a player hater, just peep game
Keep your mind on your money, watch the bitch change
See, hoes love thugs and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker 'fore I shoot, who do you love?

Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
You might also like
I'm livin' that thug life, baby
Steady smokin' Indo, goin' crazy
Baby, come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
We in the dark, do you love me?
Everybody's talkin' 'bout they know me
But they ain't down like my motherfuckin' homies
Tell me what you need when you see me
And we can get it on, bitch, take it easy
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number, baby, call me when you're lonely
'Cause it's a man's world, ain't no need to ask why
I'm high 'til I die and strapped with my .45
'Cause you can lose it in the gutter
I wonder if I'll die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
They call me the alcoholer, I'm all in
Thug for life, nigga, ballin'
I'm gettin' tired of these hoes tryna play me
You can't fade me and my niggas goin' crazy
All day long I'm straight thuggin', and constantly mean muggin'
Breakin' the bitches that be buggin', tell me who do you love?

Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?14Embed
