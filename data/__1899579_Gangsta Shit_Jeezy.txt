5 ContributorsGangsta Shit Lyrics
Gangsta shit, gangsta shit
Niggas keep talking all this gangsta shit
You never did nothing nigga, nigga you ain’t seen shit
So why you keep talking all this gangsta shit
Gangsta shit, gangsta shit
Niggas keep talking all this gangsta shit
Throw it out the window, nigga we ain’t tryna hear it
Glizzy keep on making all that gangsta shit

Gangsta nigga, I need a gangsta bitch
30 in the glizzy, that’s a gangsta clip
Glizzy coming through here in a gangsta whip
I only speak to niggas with a gun on their hip
Rappers sneak dissing, still can’t get a deal
My whole team living, you don’t know how it feel
It’s either music murder or I’m going to jail
Sometimes I be like fuck this shit, let me get back in the field
My dogs with ski masks, know they hit and no they don’t just wear it
Bitch I brought my own scale, here you go, you can weigh it
I got bullets same size as a bitch nigga head
We hop out that  spread, that’s when we get to spraying

Gangsta shit, gangsta shit
Niggas keep talking all this gangsta shit
You never did nothing nigga, nigga you ain’t seen shit
So why you keep talking all this gangsta shit
Gangsta shit, gangsta shit
Niggas keep talking all this gangsta shit
Throw it out the window, nigga we ain’t tryna hear it
Glizzy keep on making all that gangsta shit
You might also like
Gangsta nigga, move how the gangstas move
Want a crib like John Gotti with a gangsta pool
Penthouse in the city with a gangsta view
I mean that bitch all glass, bad bitch all ass
Sell that steel in the tape, now that’s a gangsta flip
Four on the backseat, now that’s a gangsta trip
Rolls Ghost, sky dwelling, now that’s gangsta nigga
Carbon rifle with the drum, that bitch will paint you nigga
Gangsta bitch about her business, why I be fucking with shawty
Plus I love my bro, bro that nigga keep that forty
Blue big face hundreds on your dog like fleas
Sitting on Italian leather, ordered this overseas
All my niggas in the pen or they dead
Had to pay for a couple funerals, sent some bread to the feds
Gave me a bag full of ones so I guess you want to play
It was rush hour traffic, I was busting broad day

Gangsta shit, gangsta shit
Niggas keep talking all this gangsta shit
You never did nothing nigga, nigga you ain’t seen shit
So why you keep talking all this gangsta shit
Gangsta shit, gangsta shit
Niggas keep talking all this gangsta shit
Throw it out the window, nigga we ain’t tryna hear it
Glizzy keep on making all that gangsta shit5Embed
