8 ContributorsWhoo Kid Freestyle Lyrics
Yo, this is 50 cent, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm here with my man Whoo Kid
You know how I put it down, nigga
It's not safe around here as soon as the street lights
G-Unit, nigga
What? What? Nigga, yeah
Yeah, we in here, what's up, nigga?
50 Cent, nigga

We can't get money selling weed? (We gon' sell coke)
Ain't no money selling coke? (We gon' sell dope)
Ain't no money selling dope? (We gon' sell X)
And if niggas won't buy the X? (Then we gon' sell tech's)

My advice for y'all niggas is stop frontin'
'Cause if 50 say "Pop something," I'm gon pop something, what up?

Don't make me send a nigga to you, 16 shot ruger
Send 12 shots to you, run four in the clip
Get in the whip, it's a wrap

Nah, fuck that
You might also like
Man, you done hit the nigga twice in the head, that's that
Niggas running with the steel out, now it's time to peel out

50, let me drive

I got this, nigga, chill out

And I ain't scared of niggas, I ain't scared of gettin' bagged

I'm just scared of the corner store 'cause it's full of them Arabs
They blowing the shit up like it's okay
I got a bomb on my waist, I'm Kamikaze
I dare D's to get next to me

Or a nigga to creep up and put a tec to me

Yeah, yeah that'sâ€“that's it, nigga
That's it, it's a freestyle, the fuck you want for free?
Fucking Arabs just ran the fucking planes into the building
The fuckin' price went up 10 grand this fucking week4Embed
