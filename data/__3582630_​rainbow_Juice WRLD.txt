Pockets on big, no little
Got white like Malcolm, no middle, oh
My bitch give me migraines, need Percocets, no Tylenol
If I want it I get it (I get it)
Fuckin' with me, she get it all
Diamonds different color like Skittles (Skittles)
Diamonds different color like Skittles, oh
She taste the rainbow, uh
While I count the bankroll, oh
She taste the rainbow, uh
While I count the bankroll, oh
Pockets on big, no little (No little)
Diamonds different color like Skittles
Diamonds different color like Skittles, oh

I'm getting faded
I'm driving different places
I'm in L.A. livin' life (Life, life)
Put my dick in your wife (In your wife, in your wife)
I tie up my laces
I'm ballin' like I'm Calvin Cambridge
My Margiela's make me Like Mike (Me Like Mike, hehehe)
Jumping from the free-throw line (Jumping from the free-throw line)
She's runnin' through my head (Head)
Do Xanax 'til I'm dead (Dead)
Came up on so much money, that shit do not make no sense
My diamonds different colors like a rainbow in hair
I smoke away my problems but they won't disappear
I don't have any friends
I'm in it 'til the end
My girlfriend say she hate me cause' of Percocets again
She always think I'm cheatin', all these hoes in my crib
I tell her I don't love them, I just fuck 'em and dip
I just fuck 'em and dip (And dip, and dip, and dip)
I just fuck 'em and dip (And dip, and dip, and dip)
Taste the rainbow (Taste the rainbow, taste the rainbow)
Love you, taste the rainbow

Diamonds different color like Skittles (Skittles)
Diamonds different color like Skittles, oh

I just got that white, Malcolm in the Middle
Play her like a fiddle
Play her like a fiddle, oh
I'm in her mouth, put my dick all in her jaw
She taste the rainbow (Taste the rainbow)
Fresh to death, Gucci's with a halo (With a halo, huh)
Run up on me, I'm Kalo (Me I'm Kalo, me I'm Kalo)
Choppa on me shoot fuego (Me shoot fuego, me shoot fuego)
She taste the rainbow (Taste the rainbow)
I shoot like Rambo, oh
Feel like Mutombo
Get that shit up out my house
I'm 'bout my money ('Bout my money)
I'm gon' stack it out
Your girl dancin' (Your girl dancin')
Watch her walk it out
She know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Fuckin' all these bitches in they mama house
Then I fuck they mama in they mama house
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
