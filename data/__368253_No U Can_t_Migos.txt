13 ContributorsNo U Canâ€™t Lyrics
I can buy that car, I know that you can't
I can buy the bar, I know that you can't
I can afford your bitch, I know that you can't
I can afford my wrist, I know that you can't
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't
I can buy the bar, I know that you can't
I can buy that car, I know that you can't

No you can't, no you can't
You don't sip that lean by the pint
You a peon, you don't got rank
Call the plug up, get a pound of stank
Quavo Stuntin, name hold weight
In the kitchen and I make a earthquake
When you walk around, pocket full of cake
Gotta keep your grass low, full of snakes
Chevrolet SS on skates
Got a white girl, her name Kate
Got a Chinese girl named Ling
She love to pop them 
Got a rocket on my hip, Yao Ming
Get money in my dreams
In the hood, they call me king
In the Ville or the Upper 100 wings
Can't walk cause I'm sippin' on lean
Got a 9, call me Luol Deng
Ever since a young nigga 
Don't never let the money make me
Grow up to be what I wanna be
Don't ever let a nigga make me
And I put that on my momma
My pockets filled up with lasagna
You might also like
I can buy that car, I know that you can't
I can buy the bar, I know that you can't
I can afford your bitch, I know that you can't
I can afford my wrist, I know that you can't
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't
I can buy the bar, I know that you can't
I can buy that car, I know that you can't

Got bands, I ain't talkin' 'bout a college
I got a foreign bad bitch, she exotic
All black, little nigga, wearin' gothic
Uppercut a nigga like Bernard Hopkins
Got flavor, no Baskin and Robbin
Pull up in the Batman with the Robin
You playin', ain't 'bout no bottle
Sip codeine out the baby bottle
Grape Maserati look like a 
You 
You can still rock an Artful Dodger
Real G, blowin' up, Pearl Harbor
Cut the work like a nigga was a barber
In the kitchen with them toddlers
In the hood with them robbers
In the bando with them choppers
I'ma G like the Green Bay Packers
Young Takeoff, call me NASA
Fuck with my money
That chopper gon' stretch you out like cardiovascular
You can't even flip no brick
You can't even flip no nick
You never had purple codeine
Your Sprite always look clean
Sip lean, double cupped with the ice
Drop 85 hundred for the ice
When a nigga talk crazy, hang his ass
Like Suge did Vanilla Ice
Wish a nigga would try to steal my ice
88 birds in the trunk, Jerry Rice
You can't do that real nigga shit
Know some young niggas, eleven, walkin' 'round with the Emmett
I can buy that car, I know that you can't
I can buy the bar, I know that you can't
I can afford your bitch, I know that you can't
I can afford my wrist, I know that you can't
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't
I can buy the bar, I know that you can't
I can buy that car, I know that you can't2Embed
