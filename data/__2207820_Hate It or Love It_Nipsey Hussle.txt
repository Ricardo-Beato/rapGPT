8 ContributorsHate It or Love It Lyrics
My face fat, that means I'm eating — where your steaks at?
Where your real dogs that love you, not them fake cats?
Where them girls that got your name as a face tat?
Know you by your first, can't replace that
Beefin' with your niggas, so you stay strapped
Believe me it's religious, where your grace at?
Jumping off the porch, where your faith at?
Where the blocks where you made your plays at?
I put Slauson on the map, you gotta face facts
Kept it hood like six braids and blue wave caps
Said I couldn't but I did, you can't change that
You can hate it, you can love it, I don't change, jack

Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
I will never let you stop my grind
I came too far to look behind
You said I couldn't — I did it, I did it
You said I wouldn't — I did, I did
And you can't stop me, you can't stop me
You can't stop me, no

Haters tryin' to fuck with my mind
Keep on talking from behind
I ain't got no worries at all
Nigga, I grind for this (That's right)
Homie, I'm made for this
This is to my exes that be sayin' we don't get along
They can hate but I know they gonna hear this song
Oh, and you ain't ever found a young nigga like me, no
Yeah I did what you said I wouldn't do
You might also like
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it (Hate it or love it)
I will never let you stop my grind
I came too far to look behind
You said I couldn't — I did it, I did it
You said I wouldn't — I did, I did
And you can't stop me, you can't stop me
You can't stop me, no

Look, from 108 bus stops, bustin' 'til the gun stop
To pulling up in young drops, and park in front the drug spots
Look at how your young popped, look at how these youngs flock
Looking out my living room, like, "Hell no, I won't stop"
All I need is one shot, that's just how we was taught
Sitting in a circle all silent, that's 'cause funds talk
Desperation rubbed off, found myself, I was lost
Sketched it out, architect, the blueprint of a young boss

Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
I will never let you stop my grind
I came too far to look behind
You said I couldn't — I did it, I did it
You said I wouldn't — I did, I did
And you can't stop me, you can't stop me
You can't stop me, no
Yeah, sometime I think, that
All I do is break hearts, all these nigga fake hard
I ain't catch a state charge, so I just wanna thank God
See me in that new car, see me with that new broad
Everything I've been through, tell me I went too far
I ain't done enough, nigga — screaming out, "Fuck niggas!"
This ain't good luck, nigga — another good run, nigga
I'd done had two or three, and between you and me
I don't hate none of y'all 'cause jealousy ain't new to me

Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
I will never let you stop my grind
I came too far to look behind
You said I couldn't — I did it, I did it
You said I wouldn't — I did, I did
And you can't stop me, you can't stop me
You can't stop me, no

I think it's stronger than faith at this point
It's like a constant, it's like gravity, you know
You don't have faith in the ground
You just know when you put your feet on it it's gon' stand solid
And that's how I feel about music2Embed
