Charlie Shuffler
Ahaha, MISOGI

Get back, back, back, get back
Get back, back, back, get back, back (hoo!), back (hoo-ou), back
Get back bitch (brr), back, get back
Get back bitch (Lil Boat!), back, get back (hoo!)
Get back bitch (get back)
Get back, get back
Get back bitch, get back
Get back bitch, get back
Get back bitch, get back

Get back bitch, keep a strap bitch
Keep a backpack filled with them stacks bitch (bih!)
Flip a jack on his back if he rat quick (du-du-du-uh)
And that 458 let the dash hit (skr-skr-skr-skrrt)
Let the dash hit (skrt), let the dash hit (bow!)
Let them know I'm a blast from the past bitch (brat! brat! brat!)
Let it rain, bullet shells, It don't rain in hell (du-du-du-du)
She a thot on the low she gon fuckin tell (hoo!)

Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get back
Get back, get back, get back, get backYou might also like2Embed
