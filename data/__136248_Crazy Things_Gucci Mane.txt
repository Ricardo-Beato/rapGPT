13 ContributorsCrazy Things Lyrics
I can make a duece duece do some crazy things
Dope so good, make a junkie do some crazy things
Choppa with me, I might do some crazy things
I got yo girlfriend with me, she gon do some crazy things
I got straight A on them 6's, it's some crazy things
That dope so good it make a snorter catch some crazy dreams
I got that gangsta cush and that shit amazing man
Ain't nothing but white bitches at my party, it's crazy man

I like to stay down with my ho so now I'm crazy paid
My credit working, make it double, I'm cashin crazy plates
I'm from the middle of the city like a grady baby
And I be piped up when they see me, I got crazy flavor
Turn it up so loud nigga, I might wake yo neighbors
Einstein what you sayin, go bout what it say on the papers
Might move to Oakland just to watch a game of the Raiders
No flexing, they connected this with the dope like the cable
When I go to table you can tell that I'm hunting
My stomach get craving, it's smelling them hundreds
Can you feelin it comin, I'm not in it for money
And I hate to say, I can make a bitch do some crazy things

I can make a duece duece do some crazy things
Dope so good, make a junkie do some crazy things
Choppa with me, I might do some crazy things
I got yo girlfriend with me, she gon do some crazy things
I got straight A on them 6's, it's some crazy things
That dope so good it make a snorter catch some crazy dreams
I got that gangsta cush and that shit amazing man
Ain't nothing but white bitches at my party, it's crazy man

Junkie gon slap crazy, my trap is crazy
You'd think this shit was 1980's and I fucked with Reagan
I didn't have no daddy to bring the bacon so i brought home the baking
And if you think you gon punk Guwap then you sadly is mistaken
I got 200 thousand cash on me, I'mma go to Vegas
And I don't need no fuckin no Jenny Craig, my money overweight
I don't even pay the rent cause always overpay
And I overtip in 100's cause I'm Gucci man, I'm rich to stay
I go anywhere I wanna go, I double dare you to try to flap
I'm a have to fly her to because this pussy gon have to come in now
I'm a flip the pack and switch the spots, I know the folks gon run me now
And you can't tell me shit bout East Atlanta, bitch I know it's moneyed up

I can make a duece duece do some crazy things
Dope so good, make a junkie do some crazy things
Choppa with me, I might do some crazy things
I got yo girlfriend with me, she gon do some crazy things
I got straight A on them 6's, it's some crazy things
That dope so good it make a snorter catch some crazy dreams
I got that gangsta cush and that shit amazing man
Ain't nothing but white bitches at my party, it's crazy man1Embed
