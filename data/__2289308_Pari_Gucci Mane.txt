20 ContributorsPari Lyrics
Garçon
Mon frere
Guwop
En paris

Bichon Frisé I’ll suck your teeth
I don't want cha no more, freak
Bitch i'd rather beat my meat
Be with me than be with we
I'm a dog off the chain
Bitch I'm really off the leash
Orange ferrari trick or treat
We in france but I'm not french
Bitch i dance around these diamonds
Dancin', dancing with the stars
Codeine, molly and three xan bars
I can't even parallel park
Bon appétit
We have to eat
Don't take no peak
Me and my freak
You hear capeesh then say capeesh I got a fleet
They can't compete Guwop is street
Pepe le pew
Kissing on her romp
Show my Rollie (BURR)
You might also like
Pardon me mister do you have some that grey poupon
Me and my driver smokin chronny no garçon we keep them guns
Live in paris at a fashion show
Tell PETA get fuck way from me
Got her full of mink and rankin' reefer
White folks keep on chasing me
Queen elizabeth I'm in great br br br br br br BURR
Just got back from burr-burr Russia I'm a rich ass muthafucka
Queen elizabeth I just came back from great br br br br br br br
Home boy Gucci overstand I talk way more than english man

My personal driver smoke all by himself
He cannot pass his blunts for nothin
My swisher sweet is double-stuffed just like the coupe
We dumped the fuckin’ guts
He can't rock no bur bur berry white man with him no Jim Carrey
He is in love with that white girl, Queen Elizabeth he marry
Just came back from chiraq out there it be cold like br br burr
I'm geeked up I'm a super nerd you cross me you'll be in the dirt
In Paris stay away from me got big bread like a bakery
No no he ain't get no money here so this is not the place to be
In london smellin just like pe pe, bitch i think im El Jefe
I'm a boss up in this be-be-bently drinkin muddy messy
Pardon me mister do you have some that grey poupon
Me and my driver smokin chronny no garçon we keep them guns
Live in paris at a fashion show
Tell PETA get fuck way from me
Got her full of mink and rankin' reefer
IPhones keep on chasin me
Queen elizabeth I'm in great br br br br br br BURR
Just got back from burr-burr Russia i'm a rich ass muthafucka
Queen elizabeth I just came back from great br br br br br br br
Home boy gucci overstand I talk way more than english man1Embed
