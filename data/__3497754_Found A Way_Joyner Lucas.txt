She said she grew up with no mama
And never knew her papa
No-one to adopt her
Her grandma in a doctor's and her grandpa in a coma
No-one to console her
The winds start to get stronger and them nights start to get colder and her heart start to get weaker
She wonder why she breathing
She started thinking "nothing worse than living life with no meaning when there's nothing else to believe in
And your dreams shattered in pieces"
Started feeling like Jesus in this world surrounded by demons
Every fucking day is a problem
Fired from her new job, and
She prostitutin' for dollars just to pay her way through college
But this shit is making her weak
And the pills making her sleep
And the niggas taking her drinks and left her for dead, raped in the street
Her life was prolly laying uncovered
But ain't nobody know nothing
And the ambulance just rushed her to the hospital to resuscitate and back to life she made it
But inside she died, despite the agonies that she faced she picked the pieces up and got straight and said she'd find a way

Find a way x17

He said he grew up with no patience
Parents on vacation
Left home with no trace he started hanging out with them gangsters, yeah, them muhfuckers from 
Running round with no patience
The sky start to get darker and them nights start to get dangerous and his mind start to get weak
Contemplating 'bout leaving
Started thinking "ain't nothing worse than living life with no meaning
When there's nothing else to believe in
And your dreams shattered in pieces"
Started feeling all real and ready, so he signed up for the military
Guess fighting War is his way to vic'
The fucking up gon pay the rent
Met a girl, he made a friend
He loved her kids like they were his
He found love, and it's sweet
But the War making him weak
Put a bullet right in the cheek
And left him for dead right in the street
His life was prolly laying uncovered
And them soldiers can't stop bustin'
And the helicopter just rushed him to the hospital to resuscitate and back to life he made it
And later on he got married, heard his wife was having a baby, homie, big congratulations, cuz he found a way

People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing and it's totally true and the reason is, uh, because it's so hard that if you don't, any rational person would give up. It's really hard, and you have to do it over a sustained period of time, so if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it, if you don't really love it, you're gonna give up ("Find a way" x 17) and that's what happens to most people actually, if you're looking at the ones that ended up y'know, being successful on quote "the eyes of society" and the ones that didn't, oftentimes, it's the ones that were successful loved what they did so they could persevere, y'know and come to the top, and the ones that didn't love it quit, because they're sane, like, who would wanna put up with this stuff if you don't love it? So it's a lot of hard work, and it's a lot of worrying constantly...2Embed
