16 ContributorsLyricism Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh
I run game like a sony
The original Mac Pro, sue Apple yeah they owe me
I'm real like iMac, you bootleg phony
The center of attention but you at the cypher lonely
When I step up on the stage everybody getting loud
Call me double 07 cause I bond with the crowd
Say he rhyming with the rest of 'em
Up there with the best of 'em
No style can compare like Marc Jacobs addressing 'em
Inside the booth that’s my only safe haven
Flyer than a 747 out of Reagan
Ha, I keep the flow abstract
Keep the toast close to my six pack so im ab strapped
Nah, but it sounded tight right (Right, right, right)
Yeah, I said this buzz I'm creating is light years ahead
To infinite and beyond my shit is bomb
Like Al Qaeda carry on
You want beef I'll give it to you classy like filet mignon motherfucker
Ha yeah, yo shit is vary like a military commissary
Oh my bad I mean cheesy cause your vocab it varies
Give me the mic and you know I'ma fucking smash this
I want my record in constant rotation like the earths axis
Never need to tighten up my game I spit ratchets
I'm David Blain you bammers is hat tricks
I'm a somersault off the boat you just a back flip
Any competitor whatever come face me
Homie im already straight you can't brace me
Yeah, I keep my cool like AC
That franchise flow you know we spread like Macy's
Any style, any pace I can flow it all
Getting brain in the booth I'ma know it all
You bleeding right through yo face homie yes, you show it all
I got that vi la Vida poker face I don’t show at all
This is maturity homie but you don’t grow at all
Pretends the fans minds is money I blow it all
Y'all slipping falling y'all can't get up
Call me Drake's ACL, I tear shit up
No disrespect homie
Nothing intended this is wordplay only
Never synthetic I keep it real never keep it phony
Stand out like blue jeans on the red carpet before the tonies
It ain't over till the fat lady sing and I got that bitch gagged
I been red flagged by these posers that brag
I'm Comcast, they Fios
I study they bios
So if we beef I have the upper hand on all my rivals
This is just a bit of lyricism for your mind
Encrypted like Egyptian hieroglyphics and rewind
And listen to the punchlines divine to blow ya fucking mind
Enjoy yourselvesYou might also like1Embed
