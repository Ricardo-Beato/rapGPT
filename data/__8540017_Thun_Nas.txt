Thun (Queens in the house)
Queensbridge, baby (Queens in the house)
No doubt, no doubt (Queens in the house)
No doubt, no doubt

Not niggas I really met through music shit
It be some real thuns I grew up with
Phone calls from the feds, long stories told fast
Wishin' they’d get home in a hurry 'cause we the last
Of a dyin' pack of lions, nightmares of the cast
Thoroughbred survivin’, you know (Queens in the house)

Welcome home Ronnie Bumps, and love to Corley
That boss ordered us lobster tails late night in forty
We was out there tryna rid the strеss
Had a beat tape from Stretch
Rеst, black TEC, black vest to match the dark aura
We hit the city deep in the Explorer, lookin' at The Source
Wish I was the cover story that was comin' shortly
Cars back then had raw packed in
Rest in peace a few good men, the god Starkim (Queens in the house)
I pop a bottle, we not promised tomorrow
Showin' love is the motto
Flex a cowboy hat, strapped like Desperados
They ain't let one out the chamber, no iron fired
In a vegetative state when that man China died
Stomped out on 12th Street, memory fails me
Heard homie was a real G, that's what they tell me
I was the one to run through the functions, no funny actin'
And it was me in that introduced many to Money Bags and (Queens in the house)
Grandmaster Vic (Queens in the house)
The DJ's Disco Twins (Queens in the house)
From the towers to Pomonok (Queens in the house)
Host a party up at Starlets, they know Queens in the house
No beef or rivals, they playin’ "Ether" on TIDAL
Brothers can do anything when they decide to
In a Range Rover, dissectin’ bars from "Takeover"
Sometimes I text Hova like "Nigga, this ain't over", laughin’
I had to hold it down for Queens, 'cause I over-value fiends
Shout to Brooklyn, all between, hoods be overlappin'
Subways be stacked and I ain't been on a train in decades
And I can still hear the wheels on the tracks (Queens in the house)
Feel the beat breaks, serial defaced for Jakes
A license to carry still ain’t safe in New York State
It's still a lot of ways to manage the life expectancy average
The future of our next generation ain't been established
Conflicted by some of the same patterns that had us
Money and social status, tell me what really matters
So who are you when they turn off all the cameras?
With me, you know the answers (Queens in the house)
Go ask Tony Bennett (Queens in the house)
Terrace on the park, they gotta know (Queens in the house)
DJ Clue, Envy and Camilo (Queens in the house)
Where are my most beautiful queens in the house?
When you see me at awards or a popular place
I see chains shinin', I want a stocking over my face
Coordinated, try to seat me by some popular names
For a second, I'm on some shit like it was back in the days
When dudes would really put that thing up to your rib cage
And pull a switchblade, do anything, it's the 'Bridge way
But I go stu', roll through, just sold out the O2
Piece on my neck in a Hi-Tech Polo suit (Queens in the house)
Drove down Van Wyck, Colosseum and Stan Smiths
Tan blick in the desert brick town where my man's live
You might also like
Not niggas I really met through music shit
It be some real thuns I grew up with
Phone calls from the feds, long stories told fast
Wishin' they'd get home in a hurry 'cause we the last
Of a dyin' pack of lions, nightmares of the cast
Thoroughbred survivin', you know (Queens in the house)

No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt
(Queens in the house, Queens in the house)
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt (Queens in the house)
I'm on some shit, boy, make it a classic tonight
That money gettin' borough 'bout that action, that's right
Thunderous (What up thunny-thun-thun?)
Mad thunderous (Okay now)
Manhattan keeps on makin' it (Yeah) Brooklyn keeps on takin' it (Yeah)
Bronx keeps creatin' it (Yeah) and Queens keep on cakin' it
Shouts to the Westside, to the 6 Borough, Far Rock
Southside and Northside (Queens in the house)4Embed
