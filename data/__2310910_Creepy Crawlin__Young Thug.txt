5 ContributorsCreepy Crawlinâ€™ Lyrics
It's still woken, I'm creepy crawlin'
They still stalkin', I'm creepy crawlin'
Janelle walk in', she creepy crawlin'
These young stalkers , I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm creepy crawlin', I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm ridin' round (?) and I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm fuckin' all these bitches and I'm creepy crawlin'
The feds watchin' us shit I'm creepy crawlin'

I'm ridin' around creepin' and crawlin'
Yo ho just ridin' round creepin' you stalkin'
All the kids scared of that .44 too, it's growlin'
Three bitches singing on my dick, Destiny's Child
I have a thousand ways of dressin' like island
Catch me on the island with somebody (?)
We smilin', we wildin'
And we smokin' (?)
And I thought it was all fun and games
Until my girlfriend hit my phone and said whose drivin'
And I was like hold up
Tried to pour my cup up then she knocked it over
Then I almost threw up then she said I told ya
Then I thought I was from New Orlean when she said I know ya
Get it?

It's still woken, I'm creepy crawlin'
They still stalkin', I'm creepy crawlin'
Janelle walk in', she creepy crawlin'
These young stalkers, I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm creepy crawlin', I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm ridin' round (?) and I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm fuckin' all these bitches and I'm creepy crawlin'
The feds watchin' us shit I'm creepy crawlin'

I'm creepin' and I'm crawlin'
I got bitches in New Orleans
I got bitches up in Canada
They fuck me if I need stamina
Got a black gun with a red beam
Got a red car it's drippin' clean
It's strippin' clean, you can call it a Musking
Mushing
Wanna know who in it?
It's me, your bitch, and my whole team
Aka it's double M
BK the gold team
We be the oh shit, there they go, that's them team
Empty out all your pockets, no police
I'm thugga baby, I'm thugga baby
Lil C eat molly pies, he's a custer baby
Still screamin' free my brothers baby
They locked up for lethal weapons, Danny Glover baby
It's still woken, I'm creepy crawlin'
They still stalkin', I'm creepy crawlin'
Janelle walk in', she creepy crawlin'
These young stalkers, I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm creepy crawlin', I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm ridin' round (?) and I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm fuckin' all these bitches and I'm creepy crawlin'
The feds watchin' us shit I'm creepy crawlin'

Aligator khhhh
Ridin' round with a whole bunch of bears
And they don't care about none of you there
Break the whole damn street
You gotta watch Channel 2 from the air
My momma got me smellin' like a cherry block
So therefore I fuck bitches the age of 40,000
I done got so rich to the point that I can't even count it
Try to take any piece
You can call me hunter cause I'm gonna be bounty
Weezy lost his head, I think I found it
Oh damn that was your girl, she in the back loungin'
Left my swag in this car I think lil nigga found it
But I'm high as a mountain of ounces
It's still woken, I'm creepy crawlin'
They still stalkin', I'm creepy crawlin'
Janelle walk in', she creepy crawlin'
These young stalkers, I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm creepy crawlin', I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm ridin' round (?) and I'm creepy crawlin'
I'm fuckin' all these bitches and I'm creepy crawlin'
The feds watchin' us shit I'm creepy crawlin'1Embed
