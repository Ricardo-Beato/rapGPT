5 ContributorsStrip Club Lyrics(Chorus: Jeezy)
Life is like a strip club
When you spendin' all your money then you get love
When you run up out of ones then you throw Doug's
When you spend up all your money ain't no love, (yeah)

It's 20 for the top, 10 for the bottom
Like them girls bottoms, man they wanna see me drop
Bitch nigga fuck y'all, I ain't going no where
You can take it all off bitch, I ain't gon' stare
Looking so good got that ass read up
Did what I had, took them stacks and re-up
Why these whack hoes prayin' for my down fall?
Then wonder why I won't answer their call
Broke hoes hate man, broke hoes in it
Stay away from fake shit, fake shit ain't in me
When Young was in the buildin' can't say it didn't flow
Better get there early, might be late for the show
Now niggas change cause ain't been through in awhile
Like every time I came through and blow a few thou
Give you everything I got, yeah I know you love that
But when it's all said and done, bitch where the love at?
(Chorus: Jeezy)
Life is like a strip club
When you spendin' all your money then you get love
When you run up out of ones then you throw Doug's
When you spend up all your money ain't no love, (yeah)
You might also like
More money more problems, that a motherfuckin' fact
And I can do bad all by my goddamn self
When I was alone they was bad for my goddamn health
So called homies praying on my down fall
Then wonder why I won't answer their call
Bitch niggas hate man, broke niggas in it
Stay away from fake shit, fake shit ain't in me
Shit get deep make a nigga go nuts
Swear they wanna see me dead in a brand new tux
If my tombstone read "realist nigga ever done it"
Niggas can't say I ain't keep it 100
Gave niggas jobs, even gave niggas change
Niggas ain't gave me a motherfuckin' thing
Niggas wanna be me, yeah I know you love that
But when it's all said and done, nigga where the love at?
(Chorus: Jeezy)
Life is like a strip club
When you spendin' all your money then you get love
When you run up out of ones then you throw Doug's
When you spend up all your money ain't no love, (yeah)

I gotta pocket full of paper
Ain't worried bout the haters
I'm just blowin' money and I feel good
But when the money gone
I'm standin all alone
Thinkin' why did I have to party so strong
Look now I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
We gotta go, goEmbed
