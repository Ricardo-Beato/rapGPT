Oh my, oh my, what a wonderful time (Yeah)
Been a minute since I pulled up outside (Skrrt-skrrt)

Dog her down with ya, yeah, work that 9 to 5 with ya, yeah
Have to smoke a pound with ya

Oh my (Yeah), on a vibe, what a wonderful time (It's lit)
Hundred deep, all my niggas outside

Drivin' to the venue like she seein' no signs
She got all the passes, she don't ever do lines
Bustin' like she single, she ain't wastin' no time (Alright)
You cannot record, that's for the show now (Oh, no)
Leave your phone, you'll get that later on now (Straight up)
Pour that special drink, that's for my throat now (Yeah)
