New York
God bless New York
I'm glad I'm from New York, word
Without no further ado, we just gon' party tonight
Yo, this is not an industry party
This is some true, true blue old school shit to me, you know
I'm a fan as well as an artist here tonight
We all gon' get down
We just gon' have some fun, alright?
Dedication, dedication
What's up, baby?
What's up, baby?
What's up, baby?You might also likeEmbed
