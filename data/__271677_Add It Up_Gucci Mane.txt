11 ContributorsAdd It Up Lyrics
Add it up, add it up
See your homie tatted up (Now this is the movie)
If he used to make you mad, it's gone make you madder
Add it up, add it up (Gucci Tarantino)
Got the fire, back it up
See your homie swagged up (Jon Cruz, nigga, Gangsta Grillz is back, niggas)
It's the Gangsta Grill
These boys be ill (Gangsta Grillz, two-six, Sean)
Add it up, add it up (Oh, yeah?)
Add it up, add it up (Yeah, yeah, yeah, Gucci get 'em, Gangsta Grillz)

Jumpin' out my beamer like a stuntman on my stunt
Though my leather is so soft I put my top off in the trunk
Baby shakin' gettin' places say she seen me in my dump
Picked her up in purple 'vette deuces on back 20s on front (Gangsta)
Gucci shout at hot tamales (Huh?), even copped a Masarati (Oh)
And that Lambi and a Bentley shout out to my nigga Quic (Gangsta Grillz)
Shout out to my boy Diego makin' pesos for them bricks
Gucci Gucci, I'm here, truly east Atlanta is the shit
I turn my swag up I'm swaggered up, yeah Gucci got his swag up
Well think you think you mad, now I'm a make you madder
I'm swaged up I'm swaggered up, boy, I think I'm so swagged up
You mustard boy so ketch it up 'cause I think I'm so swaged up (Gangsta Grillz)
Back on that dope shit, tractor, trailer, boat shit
Cookin' up that coke quick, cookin' up that dope quick
Cookin' up that coca, You can call me Sosa
Rollin' up the chocha, I need me some mo', bruh
Partna you a puta, grande mude mucha
Ask me for a deuce, fronted you an ocho
Bring me all my pesos, you know my amigo
My plug half Columbian, Gucci Mane's a negro
Smokin' on this weed doe, my girlfriend is bilingual
Ask me to speak English but I'm talkin' with my fingers
Brazilian bitches bathing in a bath tub full of singles
Snortin' powder, smokin' weed, yes they poppin' pills
M6 drop top Beamer shipped from Germany
Outfit from Sicily my bank account in Switzerland
Literally, So Icy the entity
Gucci Mane's the businessman so tell me what the business be, bitch
Me casa is colossal, swallow water with a bottle hollow
Shout out to my boy Rocco, I ball like no tomorrow
And my watch is real retarded so I call it Little Darryl
Shoot you point blank in yo head just like 'caine cousin Harold (Gangsta Grillz)
Gangsta Grillz you bastards, shout out to Drama
The feds try get, I'ma look and say your honor, I'm guilty
Get money, make money, I'm filthy
Dawg, do you feel me? Dawg, do you feel me?
Cocaine lately sellin' good and my city set (Huh?)
Gucci gotta bitch for every letter in the alphabet
You might also like
Gangsta Grillz, you bastards
So Icy Boys up next, man, huh (Gangsta Grillz, it's Gucci)

If you listenin' to this, it's The Movie
It's Gangsta Grillz and iceman Gucci (DJ Drama)
Pull the cars out turn the sound up (Gangsta)
Clear the bars out for a gangsta (Gangsta)3Embed
