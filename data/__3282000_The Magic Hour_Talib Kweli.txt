13 ContributorsThe Magic Hour Lyrics
Last one to fall asleep, first one to wake up
(No doubt, you know how we do)
All nighters, 6:20 in the AM, man
It's the magic hour
Doing it til the sunrise
I live my life in the sunshine
It was as beautiful as Hawaiian beaches
Usually it's the students to be the truest teachers
(No doubt, you know how we do)
So gorgeous, this the magic hour, yeah
Start of a new day, it's a new way
Get with the new way

Uh, back to the future like a delorean
Documenting the struggle I'm huddling with historians
Making a way back to Brooklyn like we the warriors
Told you this man's story bordering on vainglorious
Heading to Cali for an education of Sonny Carson
And the need to police resurrection of Johnnie Cochran
Never accepted the rejection cause failure never an option
That's the gospel like Mahalia, I'm a legend, I've been a problem nigga
They still asleep in this dormez-vous like Frere Jacques
Pardon my french like Remy Martin and Henny bottles
The chances of survival more shallow than winning lotto
The liquor that they swallow got them rattled, plenty Benny Blanco bravado
Look at 'em fronting for these models
La mujeres mulattos on the floor with the wobble wobble
Sipping moscato while selling themselves for follows
This shit is intense like a Pentecostal revival
I'm in these streets like potholes, where the guns make Illinois to Chicago
Bap bap bap like staccato
I spit it like I just finished gargling the velocity marvelous
Get your goggles, we hit it at full throttle
I'm praying for a better tomorrow, my candle is burning slow as cubanos
I'm seeing red like Ricky Ricardo
They tried to stop my product like an embargo, but see they wallow in their sorrows
So they promises is empty and hollow, mahalo
Uh, live my life in the sunshine
Bust rhymes, beautiful as the sunrise
Plus side but the orchestra like I'm Sun Ra
Got with Alchemist like a wonder twin then we combine
The face of God got the finest features
And she listening if you tryna reach her
High Valyrian rap, looking for my Khaleesi
The ones that Ebro call minor league is the real fire breathers
Now let me teach you how to train your dragon
First rule they can't be tamed cause they ain't gon' have it
It ain't no magic just actual facts and logic here
Hip hop will flourish with nourishment and the proper careYou might also like3Embed
