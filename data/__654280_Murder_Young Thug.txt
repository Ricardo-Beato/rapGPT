Murder she wrote, murder she wrote, murder she wrote
Murder she wrote, murder she wrote, murder she wrote
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder she wrote

No bird, I'm pickin' peacock trees
I'm just trying to raise it up for all to see
Don't play or I send all the B's
And this bitch tryna get a hold of these bees
I remember ridin' around with .223s
But I'm thankful for my giving, no knees
Any blunts that we smoke bigger than legs
12 smell 'em, they tryna pull up and make us leave
Young Thugger be Pillsbury Dough, baby
Young Thugger take a brick and make it snow baby
Young Thugger turn a nine into a ho baby
When you leave Thug, you gotta change the clothes baby

Murder she wrote, murder she wrote, murder she wrote
Murder she wrote, murder she wrote, murder she wrote
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder she wrote

Now ever since I can remember
I've thugged my car tryna get a couple dollars, woah
Got more handguns than choppers
More choppers than rastas
Got more rastas than followers, woah
You can't go near my style, you'se a young thug imposter
Lyin' in this jungle, call me Young Thug Mufasa
We just livin' life and like a flu car you cop us
And if a nigga bases is loaded, we red sock 'em
Stop my grind and now I'm ridin', I'm gone kill your friend
Do it smart, even though it's a sin, you won't see the pen
I got work, we get bands and I won't be your man
And if you get it, understand, I said I won't be your man

Murder she wrote, murder she wrote, murder she wrote
Murder she wrote, murder she wrote, murder she wrote
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder she wrote1Embed
