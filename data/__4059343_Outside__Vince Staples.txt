62 ContributorsOutside! Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, citch
(Ayy, when they play shit, shoot the party up)
Yeah, yeah (Ayy, when they play this shit)
Yeah, yeah, citch

Broad day, I'm 'round yo' way
SK, come out, let's play
Draco, that's a young nigga gun (We outside, nigga)
Pull a .357, watch young niggas run
I'm active on Johnny Ha$h, you lackin' (I'm Johnny)
I'm on yo' ass, we packed him
He ran online, we catch him, we gon' blam his mind
No cappin' (Dead homies, nigga)
Park Gang since back then (Way back then)
At my Uncle Phil house with the MAC-10 (Big MAC-10)
Up at Mama Triece house, air the street out
Lil Yonn out, niggas better calm down

Left side, who 'bout that life?
Right side, who 'bout that life?
Nighttime, who 'bout to die?
Outside and out my mind
Westside, who 'bout that life?
Eastside, who 'bout that life?
North Side, who 'bout this life?
Outside and out my mind
You might also like
Young and livin' gorgeous, reinforced whips (Skrrt)
Prolly can't afford this, we in orbit
Outer space, out my face with the courtship
Never love, never trust, never gon' switch (No)
Niggas wanna press lines, so it's vest time
Press in my best life, I'm a mess, right?
Stay apart from the marks, we don't mesh right
Make 'em reassess when we see 'em in the set

Left side, who 'bout that life?
Right side, who 'bout that life?
Nighttime, who 'bout to die?
Outside and out my mind
Westside, who 'bout that life?
Eastside, who 'bout that life?
North Side, who 'bout this life?
Outside and out my mind

Niggas know the deal, when I pull up and I peel
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma heat a nigga grill
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma go in for the kill
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
Niggas know the deal, when I pull up me and Phil
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma really do a drill
I'ma, I'ma do him shitty, yes I will
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma1Embed
