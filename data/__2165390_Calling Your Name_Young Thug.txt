(Goose)
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
You know we can get away
You know we can get away
(Goose with another one)
Because I'm calling your name
Because I'm calling your name

I'ma hit it, never pass it
Booty fat like she eat asses
You can't see her, you need glasses (Woah)
They can't see me like masks (Woah)
I know I want it
I know I need it
I won't mistreat it (Oh)
I expect somethin' when I treat it (Woah)
I'll show my face when it's real (Ayy)
I'll share my pints when it's real (Ayy)
Promise me that you won't squeal (Promise me)
I am your doctor, your Phil (Doctor, your)

Suck this dick, peppermint
Hey, baby (Woah)
I see you're far
Yeah, far, baby (Let's get it)

Hercules, Hercules (Ayy)
I feast on you, you nurse on me (Ayy)
I love you strongly, they phony (Ooh)
I'm drunk on her, she all on me (On me)
Haiti slang, girl, you the business (Haitian)
I'm hungry, eat her like Denny's (Eat her)
On this Hannah Montana
Their jewelry's sunny, yours windy (Woo)
Every day I see you, I wan' fuck you by the pound (Ayy)
I came to the town, discovered it, lost and found (Ayy)
Baby, you know I am the one that you want right now (You know it, ayy)
I need two cups whenever I beat it up or down (Lean, lean, lean)

She callin' me Jeffery (And what?)
I protect her like a seat belt (What?)
Nigga, money stacked up like three shelves (What, what?)
Run my older hoes off, keep my feet there (Woo)
I might settle in the shore, no seashells
I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12
Ayy, baby girl, don't meet me there, beat me there (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Plus I am a freak like three Kelsis (Woah)
Pull on up, baby, pull on up, hey
Got some racks, baby, Toys 'R' Us, woah (Hey)
I'm livin' that life, woah
Baby, I'm important like in Pedialyte (Hey)
I'ma put that pussy in saran for you (Ah)
I'ma pop a Xan and fuck that ass for you (Ah)
I'ma play dead just like a cask on you (Ah)
I'ma bleed red when I come smash on you

Suck this dick, peppermint
Hey baby
I see you're far (I see you're far)
Yeah, far, baby (Far, baby)

I'ma check that lil' bitch down in the street (Yeah)
Ain't gon' hold my head down when they see me
I'm a lion, nah, fuck it, I'm a beast (Argh)
Lil' nigga, my water blue like a genie (Woah)
Too much money to go to jail, they can't have a freebie (No way)
I bring them racks off the shelf, bitch, you know they're bleeding
Too crazy, too crazy (What?)
Like you could be my baby, lady (Woah)
Three crazy, three crazy (Three crazy)
I just might come for you like the Navy
One crazy, two crazy
New coupe Mercedes (Skrrt)
Hey, I'm just like this
Too hot, I need a fan, no 'Tasia (Woah)
She callin' me Jeffery
I protect her like a seatbelt (And what?)
Nigga, money stacked up like three shelves
Run my older hoes off, keep my feet there
I might settle in the shore, no seashells
I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12 (Ayy)
Ayy, baby girl, don't meet me there, beat me there
Plus I am a freak like three Kelsis (Woah)
Pull on up, baby, pull on up, hey (Skrrt)
Got some racks, baby, Toys 'R' Us, woah (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm livin' that life, woah
Baby, I'm important like in Pedialyte (Woah, woah)

I just drink that lean on me, I promise I ain't goin' broke
When I hit the club, them strippers smile, I give 'em hope
I know how it feels to be so broke that you got jokes
... Hah
I know, I know, I know, I know how to get that paper
I know, I know how it feels to stack racks up like acres
I know, I know how it feels, 2,000-channel cable
Eliantte-antte got me lookin' like the mayor
(What you be, Thug?) I'm a player
(And what, Thug?) I'm a slayer
(And what, Thug?) I make bail
(And plus?) I won't tell
(Hahaha) You're a winner
(In a what?) In a Beamer
(And what?) And I'm drinkin' four ounces in liter (Lean)

She callin' me Jeffery (And what?)
I protect her like a seat belt (What?)
Nigga, money stacked up like three shelves (What, what?)
Run my older hoes off, keep my feet there (Woo)
I might settle in the shore, no seashells (Chee)
I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12
Ayy, baby girl, don't meet me there, beat me there (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Plus I am a freak like three Kelsis (Woah)
Pull on up, baby, pull on up, hey
Got some racks, baby, Toys 'R' Us, woah (Hey)
I'm livin' that life, woah
Baby, I'm important like in Pedialyte (Hey)
