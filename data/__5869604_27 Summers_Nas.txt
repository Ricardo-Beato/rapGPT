61 Contributors27 Summers Lyrics
Hit-Boy

Bitch, I'm in a good mood, good groove, pour me up (Ice)
The plane leave in thirty, fix your life, hurry up (Fix your life)
Ackee, rice, peas, puttin' curry over duck (Mm)
Courtside Rockets, Warriors, Curry up (Swish)
Smokin' weed in a tux, sippin' Ricard
Sitting on Governors Isle with all the killers
Premier movies with my man De Niro
And Johnny Nunez got all the pictures
Black-grown, black-owned
Black women is the backbone (Love)
Latin food in the back room
Big business, I'ma drop a new 'gnac soon
Followin' the cash rules

Rich, matte-black Rolls, yeah, I got 'em seeing ghosts (Ghosts)
Twenty-seven summers, that wasn't even the goal (Goal)
Blowing kush clouds and we all for the smoke (Smoke)
Black card, black Rolls, more black CEOs

Bitch, I'm in a good mood, good group pulled me up (Dino)
Mass Appeal, movies and music, sign with us (Al Pacino)
All my niggas millionaires, G-Code know what's up (What up, G-Code?)
What up, Jung'? What up, Stoute? What up, Ant? What up, East?
What they say about us? (What they say about us?)
You might also like
Rich, matte-black Rolls, yeah, I got 'em seeing ghosts (Ghosts)
Twenty-seven summers, that wasn't even the goal (Goal)
Blowing kush clouds and we all for the smoke (Smoke)
Bitch, black card, black Rolls, more black CEOs11Embed
