DN, DN, DN
Dropped out of school, that shit was for the pussies
Rockin' ice, that shit, that got me pussy
Ooh, niggas tryna overlook me
Say what you want, just don’t push me (Uh)

I'm the mack, I'm the mack
Minor setbacks for major comebacks, yeah (Ooh)
I’m the mack, I'm the mack, ooh (Yeah)
I'm the mack, I'm the mack, ooh (Yeah)
I'm the mack, I'm the mack
Keep a sack, fifty racks, a'ight (Ooh)
Baby, have a talk with your son
That nigga lookin' like a sack, huh (Bitch)
I’m the mack, I’m the mack, huh (Mack)
I'm the mack with the MAC, huh (I’m the mack)
I'm the mack, I'm the mack (Mack)
Minor setbacks for major comebacks, ooh (A'ight)
I’m the mack, I'm the mack (Skeet)
I'm the mack, I'm the mack (Skeet)
I'm the mack, I'm the mack (Ooh)
I'm the mack, I'm the mack (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Lips, I wanna fuck on them lips (Uh)
Baby got natural hips, yeah (Ooh)
Beat from the back while she drip (Drip, drip, drip)
Hey, these niggas pussy like Tom
These niggas wastin' my time (My time)
The brokest nigga love to chime
In, out, been 'bout
Ben Franks, ask the bank
I may hit lick like a Jumpman
Doin' donuts like a stuntman (Skeet, skeet, skeet)
Somebody slide me some oil, no tin man
Can't ride in your whip, ain't no tint, man
Bitch (Uh)

Minor setbacks for major comebacks, yeah (Ooh)

Keep a sack, fifty racks, a'ight (Ooh)
