26 ContributorsTake Control Lyrics
Wake up, wake up (Get up)
Get up, get up (I got something for you baby, rrr)
Wake up, wake up (Rrrr)
Oh baby, now, let's get down tonight
Ooh, ooh, uh
It's some sexy shit right here baby (Wake up) you know?
Yeah, uh
'Cause when I get that feeling, ooh
I'ma have to talk to 'em on this one, uh, okay
I can tell you, darling, come take control (Uh)
Of my body and mind, just grab a hold
I need some loving (Get up, get up)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up)
I need some loving (Get up, get up, ay)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up, rrr, ay, uh)

Look here, bitches come and bitches go (Uh-huh)
Got 'еm flying in from L.A. to Y-O (Yeah)
Kinda surprised when you was knocking at thе door
'Cause I ain't even know you was gone
I'm like, "Where the fuck'd you go?"
What was that? Do I miss you? Do you want me to?
I'ma say yes, it must be what you want me to do
With them bullshit questions, ignorant suggestions
You don't give a nigga the impression that you wanna see me stressin'
You about to learn a lesson, get on some new shit like
One more fuckin' headache, I'ma get me a new bitch who care
Relax, boo-boo, keep shit moving (Shh)
'Cause what you see in the mirror is what I don't mind losing (Okay)
You might also like
'Cause when I get that feeling, ooh
I can tell you, darling, come take control
Of my body and mind, just grab a hold
I need some loving (Get up, get up)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up)
I need some loving (Get up, get up)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up)

Lovey-dovey, you love me, love me, you're thinking of me
I put my dick on your back, see, ain't no sleeping on me
Block-block, knock-knock, it don't stop
I lift your shirt up, skirt up and make your ass drop
On all fours, red wine with a blue rose
Shit cool, a Pitbull with a red nose
Man, it's so hectic
I slip out and slip back in to redirect it, connect it
From the hip to the dip
She say she wanna fuck with a Crip like Nip so I dip
Yeah, I bark and I bail
And get back into the ocean like a shark or a whale, don't tell (Shh)

'Cause when I get that feeling, ooh
I can tell you, darling, come take control
Of my body and mind, just grab a hold
I need some loving (Get up, get up, ay, okay)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up, ay)
I need some loving (Get up, get up, ay)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up, okay)
What you hate about me is what you love about me
Worship the ground I walk on, don't give a fuck about me
Playing with my heart, man, that's a dangerous game (For real)
Put this dick up in your stomach, have you saying my name
Have you like (Ayy, papi) nothing gon' stop me
I'll gorilla-fuck that ass, leave the pussy sloppy
Sucker for love, not me, I ain't that nigga
Send you back to your baby father, hatin' that nigga
He like, "Why you always mad?" You know why
Because he’s not me, you know I
Would never be that nigga that's home watching the kids
While my wife was in the street sucking another nigga dick, damn

'Cause when I get that feeling, ooh
I can tell you, darling, come take control
Of my body and mind, just grab a hold
I need some loving (Get up, get up)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up)
I need some loving (Get up, get up)
I need some loving (Wake up, wake up)

Man, that's when you come in and
Wake her up with the dick, hahaha
You don't say a motherfuckin' word
Just slide in the bed and wake her up with the dick
Get up, boo-boo (Rrr)
Get up, boo-boo (Rrr) haha
Get up! X, baby!
You know what it is5Embed
