Abracadabra
Diamonds blingin', you can't see me like I'm Casper (Yeah)
Take these bitches to Four Seasons and we wrestle (Woah, yeah)
Every motherfuckin' season, I get better (Woah, yeah)
Need a ladder 'cause my money in the nosebleed (Yeah)
All this gold on me lookin' like a trophy (Yeah)
You from opp business, you don't know me (Yeah)
Your bitch ridin' my dick like she owe me (Yeah, yeah)
First lick I ever hit was for a Rollie
I put his Nikes on my kids like a goalie
She seen the drip and let me hit it like Ginóbili
And I been lookin' 'round the city since a shorty (Woo)
Ha, ha (Woo, woo)
Ha, ayy

Mistress, mistress, tell me who my mistress is
Who the fuck is the creator of this drippin' shit?
Got all these bitches on my dick, and yeah, they milkin' shit
Niggas ain't doubled, doubled down 'cause we drippin' shit
Just a diamond in the rough
I got a bag, I'm not gon' tussle
Got sick and tired of showin' my muscle
I'm 'bout to take these niggas' ho
I'm makin' sure they missing
Um, listen, I was littin'
She shut up and catch a drip-drip
I got implants, not no fillings
Gucci, Louis shoes and Fendi
Made a million, I was straight up off a titty
Ha, ha (Woo, woo)

Abracadabra (Woo)
Way the Wock' disappear in my Shasta (Yeah)
Way I poof to the crib down from NASA (Yeah)
She pull up, drink all my red, think she Dracula
Benz Mexican, make it faster (Skrrt)
Way I drive the body, I can't crash her
Way we left the room was a disaster (Skrrt)
She like her body plastic, her walls plastered
Come like money, cover her all in the proceeds
Got a Patek that say, "B," this shit cost millies
In a second, man decided turn to billi'
Can't split this fifty-fifty with you, bitch, you silly (Let's go)
I ain't gon' front, I been back at it
I ain't tryna– (Phew, phew, phew), don't need no ins
Please lock it down with speeds, rollin' with the clique
Me, I make the magic with the brown one with the hips, yeah
