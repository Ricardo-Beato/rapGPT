12 ContributorsDoobie Ashtray 2K10 Lyrics
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray?
Why they'd do me that way?
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone?
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray (Uh)
Why they'd do me that way? (Uh)

I'm makin' the final decisions that could somehow make a nigga vision come true
Then I'ma give the game a one-two
For now I tell the homies, "Come through"
Politickin' while we chillin', plannin' how to make a million
Got the features of a ceilin', I'm high
Can't seem to figure out the formula
But when I do, I'm warnin' ya
Success I swear I'm on to ya
Joining fake friends on a journey to make Henz his attorney
I can't when these niggas clowns like Bert and Ernie
My attorney handles all the bull
Niggas try to stop me in the game, I'm on my Manning shit
Now watch me call the audible
You can gather all the pool and all the fucking tour and niggas still wouldn't be the shit to me
I'm reachin' out for a position Big ain't get to see
Give these hatin' niggas the trigger, kill 'em with creative vigor
As I make my homies leave, devote my time to payin' it back
I look around the crib and all a sudden then I'm mad because
You might also like
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray?
Why they'd do me that way?
What you gonna do when ya friends go home (I like this)
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone? (Dee Goodz)
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray (What's good? Haha, my man)
Why they do me that way? (Look, yeah, uh)

So put ya shit out in the doobie ashtray
While the ganja burnin' slow and we movin' that way
Yeah, my crew got mad haze, enough that we can share with you
I'm brand new, you could use a repair or two
Weed smoke impair my view, the color of it very blue
Who could smoke up with the Most Dope homie? Very few
Huffin' and puffin', the bud in the oven you coughin' and we love it and breakin' it down
Who be the man with a doobie in hand, calling the kid to bring it around?
Life is hard, so we smoke away the stress
Without my Mary Jane I'ma mess
So I gotta keep it fresh, grab a zip and nothin' less
You can come smoke too 'cause I love a bunch of guests, yes
Marijuana dreams, Californiacation
Take a couple hits before I have to board this plane. and
Stop complainin', just give me my weed back
Find me where the trees at, I'm just tryna relax
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray?
Why they'd do me that way?
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone?
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray
Why they'd do me that way?
