No talk, no fight
Sosa, bitch, I'm going insane
Them foreign things see foreign things
All I get is foreign things
Foreign money, foreign rings
Foreign watch, foreign chains
I still remain, fuck Tooka gang
Fuck JaJa gang, fuck Hoover gang
Die L's for the fucking lames
L's﻿ up for the KuKu Gang
I’m 2-4, lames, I'm no Insane
Call us the Jehovah gang
The nati gang that's not a game
Don’t bring that shit around my way
'Cause 'round﻿ my way them choppas spray
Bodies drop, we beat the case
My Jew lawyer defeat the case
Louis shades, can't see you lames
O'Block gang that's Keta gang
Bitch, we the conceited gang
O'Block gang that's Keta gang
Bitch, we the conceited gang
