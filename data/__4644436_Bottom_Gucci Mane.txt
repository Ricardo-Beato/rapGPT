12 ContributorsBottom Lyrics
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Tay Keith, Wop
Gucci, yeah
Tay Keith, wow
Wop, go

Shawty got a face like a model
And a frame like a Coke bottle
Big fat booty and it wobble
I'm tryna get to the bottom
Gwala got me walkin' with a waddle
Heard that pussy drippin' like water
I'ma be a genie in a bottle
And I'm tryna get to the bottom
El Gato got 'em drinkin' out the bottle
Twenty, fifty girls, it's a brothel
Pussy so good, it's a problem
I'ma try to get to the bottom
Drop my top in autumn
Fuck my opps, I shot 'em
Trick my plug, I got him
In the pot, fork scraping at the bottom

I ball out without a budget
Ring size, that's McDonald's nuggets
These bad bitches gotta love me
I'm gon' hit the bottom of it
Like Santa, I'm stocking stuffing
Dick rock hard, it's up to something
Work on me like Doc McStuffins
I'm geeked up like David Ruffin
Nobody can tell me nothing
'Til I hit her belly button
Her ex was a minute man
Two minutes, already done
Gucci Mane, I'm super rich
Bitch gotta be super thick
She pulled up, took off the trench
Nothin' on but some Louboutins
Beatin' it up, I'm talkin' shit
Bottom bitch, that's Gato bitch
All this dick, it got to fit
She gargled it and swallowed it
Slapped that ass, I left a print
She's lovin' it, it's obvious
Cocaine sex, I brought a brick
To numb out her esophagus
You might also like
Shawty got a face like a model
And a frame like a Coke bottle
Big fat booty and it wobble
I'm tryna get to the bottom
Gwala got me walkin' with a waddle
Heard that pussy drippin' like water
I'ma be a genie in a bottle
And I'm tryna get to the bottom
El Gato got 'em drinkin' out the bottle
Twenty, fifty girls, it's a brothel
Pussy so good, it's a problem
I'ma try to get to the bottom
Drop my top in autumn
Fuck my opps, I shot 'em
Trick my plug, I got him
In the pot, fork scraping at the bottom

Down South ho so cunning
Rain, sleet, snow, getting money
Lames keep calling her honey
She gon' play 'em all like dummies
When I put it in, she running
Probably put dick in her mommy
I'ma put the D in her tummy
Don't stop, ho, keep cumming
Late night kissing and touching
Waterfall, she so gushy
Beat it from the side, she bustin'
I done fell in love with that pussy
Big booty and a smile, don't trust it
Millionaire drip, she crushin'
If a bitch suck me, she lucky
She a bad lil' bitch, she bucking
Shawty got a face like a model
And a frame like a Coke bottle
Big fat booty and it wobble
I'm tryna get to the bottom
Gwala got me walkin' with a waddle
Heard that pussy drippin' like water
I'ma be a genie in a bottle
And I'm tryna get to the bottom
El Gato got 'em drinkin' out the bottle
Twenty, fifty girls, it's a brothel
Pussy so good, it's a problem
I'ma try to get to the bottom
Drop my top in autumn
Fuck my opps, I shot 'em
Trick my plug, I got him
In the pot, fork scraping at the bottom1Embed
