18 ContributorsAll A Dream Lyrics
Uh, jumped up from sleep, soaked in sweat
Heart beatin' crazy from a dream I had
We was doing it up, cash flowin'
I know you hear me, nigga, but you not knowin'
Champagne bottles and honeys floatin' in the pool
So much poppin', the jacuzzi was full
Mad hoes for the bro
And everybody rollin' up, we could all smoke
Pure Molly, good golly, that turned up the whole party a few notches
Hold up, it's all comin' back now
Cocaine buffet, mini mountains of that pretty white girl
The DJ played all the right songs, we was all faded
Bottles on the house, half naked broads on the couch
Gettin' poked up, warmin' up

Then I woke up and I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream

I had a dream I didn't even go get my Grammy
I was smokin' and fuckin' bitches in Miami
I had a dream that Biggie told me that I was nice
Then I woke up and realized it was real life
Four-fifth on my hip, bottles pop
Weed in the air, these hatin' niggas still on my dick
I had a dream that my niggas came home
Celebratin' life, then I woke up, my shit was blown
Tragic, I had a dream I had floor seats
In L.A. watchin' Bird and Magic
Exotic cars, money off-shore
Good weed, my niggas with me on tour

Then I woke up and I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream

Coke on the scale, money for the bail
Lookin' is the rear view, feds on the tail
Used to mix E&J with Ginger Ale
Sold crack when my moms drank pink champale
Now I'm in Anguilla on a ship that sails
Out the St. Maarten, got them bricks in them mail
I don't play with the money 'cause the bread get stale
Rather sleep in a box 'fore I sit in a cell
Raisin' a wine glass, spliff in the air
I'm a gangsta, shoot me in the head if I tell
Kingpin, rap nigga dreams at twelve
Was it all a dream or could I see that well?
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream

Last night watched TV but it watched me
Know what that mean, motherfucker fell asleep
Then I fell into a dream, it was so real
I was out in Vegas, blew about a half mil
Rode the strip, Rodeo we was club hoppin'
Finger poppin', had drugs droppin'
Hangover three, had bottles non-stoppin'
Top of her lungs, "World is ours!" need a lozenge
In the Luxor caused the up-roar
Celebration time lift up your cups for
If it ain't us, who the fuck you come for?
Jumped on the G5s, back to the East Coast
Rich ass nigga still keepin' the heat close
Landed, bitches on deck to deepthroat
To scavenge for liquor and c-notes
They woke up to a bed full of freak shows
And I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream

I had a dream that my first contract was a good one
When I get in I'ma let the whole hood come
Visualizin' all the things that could come
I did a lot of bad shit, I'm the good son
Everything paid for, we don't lease shit
My niggas still wit' me, that's G-shit
Four chandeliers, Master P shit
In the middle of the ocean, sea sick
Gorgeous, top of the Forbes list
No such as thing as, 'I can't afford this'
Pinky ring, sky dweller, iced out Choca
Money talks so I spoke up, then I woke up

And I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
And I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream5Embed
