21 ContributorsAll Night Lyrics
Life's a party, baby, do what you wanna do (Whoa, ah)
It's all a party, baby, and I'd like to move with you
There's a rhythm, you can feel it, you might hear it in your mind
And if all you do is worry, you'll be running out of time
So what's the use? Our time is ticking, we should groove

But just remember we 'gon do it (Ohh, alright)
Get in this party, baby, do it (Ohh, all night)
This is a one-time function (Ohh, alright)
Move at this party, we can do it (Ohh, all night) Aay, ugh

Ayo-ayo-ayo (Ayo-ayo-ayo)
Ayo-ayo-ayo (Ayo-ayo-ayo)
Ayo-ayo-ayo (Ayo-ayo-ayo)
Ayo-ayo-ayo (Ayo-ayo-ayo)

It's just a party baby, I wanna move with you
Try to enjoy yourself, cause it might be over soon
Lost some friends at the party, had to leave early on
But we still gon' have a good time, gonna party break of dawn
So don't be blue, cause all this party needs is you
You might also like
But just remember we 'gon do it (Ohh, alright)
Get in this party, make you do it (Ohh, all night)
This is a one-time function (Ohh, alright)
Move at this party, we can do it (Ohh, all night) Hay-oh-oh

Sign your name on the line, signature or initial
More like a get-together, nothing really official
Shark attack overdose, standing next to the edge
Trying to get that picture, you ain't takin' it with you
You ain't in the moment, everything that they feed you is sweet
And it's sugar-coated; my flavor, they can't control it
This that party you gotta move, but then you 'gon break a move

But just remember they gon' do it
Get in this party, make 'em do it, baby
Baby this is a one-time function, uh
Move at this party, we gon' do it
(Bring that sound in, ohh, ayo)

We gon' do it, get in this party, make you do it (Woo)
This is a one-time function, move at this party, we gon' do it
(One more time!)
We gon' do it, get in this party
Make you do it (Do-it-do-it-do-it)
This is a one-time function
Ayo-ayo-ayo (Ayo-ayo-ayo)
Move at this party, we gon' do it
Ayo-ayo-ayo (Ayo-ayo-ayo)
But, just remember we gon' do it
Ayo-ayo-ayo (Ayo-ayo-ayo) (All night)
Get in this party, make 'em do it
Ayo-ayo-ayo (Ayo-ayo-ayo) (All night)
