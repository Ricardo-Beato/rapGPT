20 ContributorsStreet Niggaz Lyrics
Ay Laflare Entertainment, DJ Ace right
And it's goin down 2006 baby, Check it out
We gon' do this shit for all my street n***az
All my thug n***az, all my trap n***az, know what im talkin bout?
All my n***az who trap all day n***a trap all night
All my n***az who stay in the street gettin it 24/7
As a matter of fact, you don't work, you don't eat
You don't grind, you don't shine, Take Off!

I'm a street nigga, dog, everybody knows that
So a hater get smashed, bond money on deck
Gave my dog half a brick for a '73 Donk
Got that bullfrog yay, cause I know it's gon' jump
I'm a real street nigga, do you understand me?
I'm a walking bankroll, breezy, rubber-band me
Red Monkeys on my ass, Gucci frames on my face
Got that "Tony Tiger Kush," man, pimpin' smoke great
Every time my phone ring, dog, it's eighteen-five
Only problem that I have is what car I'm gon' drive
Im a real street nigga, I ain't never had shit
Man, this chain 'round my neck cost four or five bricks
I'm a street nigga, dog, I don't love no bitch
I ain't talkin' to you, baby, 'less you buyin' ten bricks
Bought an '06 Lamb' with the butterfly doors
That's a quarter-million dollars gone, just to pull hoes
You might also like
I'm a street nigga, dog
I'm a street nigga, dog
You a street nigga, just like me
I'm a street nigga, dog
I'm a street nigga, dog
No industry, I'm in these streets

Im a street nigga, dog, hoes love my swag
And the Jacob on my wrist, that's a drop-top Jag
Bought a drop-top Vette, and a super-bad bitch
"How much you think you worth?"
'Bout 95 bricks
Way back in '94, it was 95 cents
Now I'm 95 south, with an R&B bitch
Every time I leave the house, bring at least ten grips
Cause it's two or three stacks just to park my whips
Got a small amount of niggas, but a large amount of clips
And a blue Bent' Coupe same color as the Crips
Mean mug on my face, nigga, ain't nothin funny
60 grand on the Jacob, nigga, time costs money
Got a quarter million plate, that's eighteen blocks
When the cops try to whip me, man, I ain't gon' stop
Im a real street nigga, dog, I ain't gon' lie
Bought a pound of Bubba Kush, just to get the clique high
I'm a street n, dog
I'm a street n, dog
You a street n, just like me
I'm a street n, dog
I'm a street n, dog
No industry, I'm in these streets

I'm a street nigga, dog, so I love my whip
Car-jack a street nigga, that's how niggas get killed
Im a street nigga, dog, so I love my block
Paid a junkie three grams just to wash my drop
Street niggas love me, and I love street niggas
Got an out of town trap, come twice a week, nigga
Im an East Atlanta vet, man, I ain't done yet
Bitches standin' in line just to wipe my sweat
If you make a good count,then you under good check
Never beef with street niggas, dog, that's ya best bet
Street niggas make a college bitch's panties so wet
To a project bitch, I'm the best it's gon' get
Street nigga of the year, dog, yeah, that's me
Just to see my wrist twirl, man, it's eighteen G's
Gucci eatin' real good, dog, what about you?
Im a street nigga, dog, you a street nigga too?
I'm a street n, dog
I'm a street n, dog
You a street n, just like me
I'm a street n, dog
I'm a street n, dog
No industry, I'm in these streets

And there you have it n***a
Gucci Mane, La-Motherfuckin-flare n***a
Strictly for the streets n***a
If you not a street n***a man you can't fuck with this shit n***a
Zaytoven what's happenin n***a? You a crazy n***a
Y'all n***az know what it is man, 2006 man
Gucci Mane, La-Motherfuckin-flare man!!!1Embed
