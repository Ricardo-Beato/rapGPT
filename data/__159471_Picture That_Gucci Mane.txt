Fuckin' round with Gucci it gone lead to an injuring
Treat ya like third period turn ya to history
Nigga say he did this but nigga's a mystery
I bet it sucks ya found out your favorite rapper's a sissy
This purple shit I'm sippin got them young niggas trippin'
He faking like he got a cough to get a prescription
You came to Atlanta but didn't ask my permission
You walked in normal but ya walked out with stitches
I'm Mister Nighttime I lose my mind with the bottles
At Ocean Prime at lunchtime eatin' steak with a model
Down south president like Jimmy Carter from Georgia
Hundred-thousand-dollar Charger parked at my headquarters

Picture that, picture that, picture that nigga
Picture that, picture that, picture that
Jumpin' out the Phantom, talkin' real mannish
Robin's Jeans saggin, bein' broke I can't imagine that
Picture that, picture that, picture that nigga
Picture that, picture that, picture that
Jumpin' out tha Rari, lookin' really handsome
Brick Squad going broke, I can't even fathom that

They say a bird in the hand beats a bird in the bushes
But there's a killer in the bushes and your shooters are some pussies
Try to rob Gucci Mane, right plan wrong nigga
Tried to make it to the Ham, got pulled over Villa Rica
Leave your sister a pistol, a kilo of the crystals
A scale, a bale, some bands and some scissors
And my money stretch longer than the Chattahoochee River
If its ten a key then I'm goin' to Chattanooga!
You say I know you like I knew you then why I do you like I do you
Bitch I flew here and you grew here
I'm not new here what's it to you?
I pour fours, and deuces, and drinks, and juices
Sell bales, and bricks, and blunts, and loosies
You might also like
Picture that, picture that, picture that nigga
Picture that, picture that, picture that
Jumpin' out the Phantom, talkin' real mannish
Robin's Jeans saggin, bein' broke I can't imagine that
Picture that, picture that, picture that nigga
Picture that, picture that, picture that
Jumpin' out tha Rari, lookin' really handsome
Brick Squad going broke, I can't even fathom that1Embed
