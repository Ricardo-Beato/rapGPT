17 ContributorsToo Fast Lyrics
Fill a cup up, fuck a slut bitch
Fuck you talkin' 'bout nigga
You know what the fuck it is nigga
My niggas rowdy, they with that ruckus
On Folks
(Hollywood J)

I'm in that robot and this bitch don't stop
And I got on tank-top with a knot
Prolly finna pick up your thot
Bitch I'm gang til' I rot, totin' Glock like a fox, nigga
Me and foe'nem be gettin' on the grass
Back-to-back doing dash in the traffic
Grandma told me that I'm livin' too fast
I fill a cup up and I sip it too fast

Pulled up them shots they dunkin' to fast
You tried to run but they coming too fast
Better not fall, I got them shooters on yo ass
Then I take a flight to Cuba on yo' ass
What's up in my cup? Mud
What's up in the chop'? Slugs
Swingin' bitch like Nunchaku
Send this bitch right at ya'
Sneak diss, we can't let ya'
Running out of Pesos
Stack that shit like lego
Always act the A-hole
You might also like
I'm in that robot and this bitch don't stop
And I got on tank-top with a knot
Prolly finna pick up your thot
Bitch I'm gang til' I rot, totin' Glock like a fox, nigga
Me and foe'nem be gettin' on the grass
Back-to-back doing dash in the traffic
Grandma told me that I'm livin' too fast
I fill a cup up and I sip it too fast

Fill a cup up, fuck a slut bitch, Semi too big, I can't tuck it
Niggas rowdy, they with that ruckus, I'm in a kush coma, concussion
I'm in Barneyâ€™s buying trousers, in New York smokin' sours
So much chicken, I need flavour, at the spot out in Braurer
I need space because I'm outer, that shit good but this is louder
I just exit off a garage, foreign got that money power
Get it hoe? I'm money shower
That bitch know that world is ours
I don't care to race man, bring the prowers
Valentino kicks and Gucci trousers
I'ma need 'bout two-three hours, before I come get the backend
Hit the stain and do the magic, Hermes belt but I'm still saggin'

I'm in that robot and this bitch don't stop
And I got on tank-top with a knot
Prolly finna pick up your thot
Bitch I'm gang til' I rot, totin' Glock like a fox, nigga
Me and foe'nem be gettin' on the grass
Back-to-back doing dash in the traffic
Grandma told me that I'm livin' too fast
I fill a cup up and I sip it too fastEmbed
