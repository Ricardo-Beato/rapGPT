44 ContributorsAngels (When She Shuts Her Eyes) Lyrics
Uh
I fuck around with amnesia, pour four inside of my liter
One day I'ma get it all cleaned up, right now I'ma dirty my jeans up
This what I do, start the day, picture bring back all the pain
All that shit that's hard to say, had a vision, lost its way
This planet different that we live in, yeah, I bet it is
Product of the new world, you stuck in Genesis
And I'm just tryna rep my city right like Bettis did
I got a crazy girl that's filled with all these fetishes

Plus she can get me high when I'm feelin' low
Fill my cup with purple, baby, drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Don't, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

I told her please don't take this back from me, this feelin' come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically
You get me high, hold me there, this is real, girl, don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grow apart or last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you, lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
I, I, I, I

I wonder where will I meet the perfect girl that I dream of
And I don't need no huge tits, I'm cool with just a good B cup
Uh, you're now free to ball, build it up, then keep it all
She don't need to call, if love the landin', then we could fall
'Til we drop dead, say everything that we've not said
I'm tellin' you that you hard to trust, you sayin' I got a hard head
This forever, don't you ever think to let me go
And if I'm talkin' to the world, I need to let 'em know

That she can get me high when I'm feelin' low
Fill my cup with purple, baby, drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Don't, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

I told her please don't take this back from me, this feelin' come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically
You get me high, hold me there, this is real, girl, don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grow apart or last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you, lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
I, I, I, I16Embed
