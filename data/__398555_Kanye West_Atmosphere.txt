52 ContributorsKanye West Lyrics
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah

She said she want somebody she could take care of
And right then is when we paired up
Pull a chair up and make a space for yourself
You should taste what I felt
It's probable that those on the bottom gonna hold you accountable
It's lonely at the top and it's also hostile
Everyone got their own course full of obstacles
Don't let your heart grow cold like a popsicle
She said she want someone to treat her as an equal
And right then we started speeding towards Reno
Burning rubber in a burgundy Regal
Fly like the dove then dive like an eagle
I'm a 70 deuce, that year was a classic
Buzz got loose and we're here trying to catch it
She said that she was unimpressed
That's when I stood up and did the Kanye West

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
You might also like
She said she needed a place to feel free
And right then we started building a team
Trying to make a better perfect, a little purpose
The only thing for certain is the sleep disturbance
But ever since people started measuring time
We've been looking for an easy way to settle our mind
Take a load off or take your clothes off
Or shut your eyes and roll straight for the roadblock
She said she needed something that she could blame
And right then is when I offered my name
It's the only thing I've got that'll always remain
So I'mma share it with you, so you can complain too
She said she want to find a cure for death
I know she meant that in the purest sense
But when I finally die, put on your Sunday best
Then throw your hands in the sky like Kanye West

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah

You need to prove nothing to me
The time got a price, but the trouble is free
If we gonna struggle I'mma do it comfortably
And live life like I love to breathe
You need to prove nothing to me
The time got a price, but the trouble is free
If we gonna struggle I'mma do it comfortably
And live life like I love to breathe
Oh yeah, oh yeah20Embed
