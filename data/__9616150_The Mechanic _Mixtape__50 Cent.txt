1 ContributorThe Mechanic (Mixtape) Lyrics
Niggas trying to front? We move on them
One up 'side the waist, squeeze the Ruge' on them
Next day we outside like who want it?
Niggas think something is sweet until we move on them
Yeah, niggas want to front? We move on them
Go through that block they pump, wave that Uzi at them
Next day we in the hoopties looking for them
Niggas think something is sweet until we move on them

I'm the mechanic, I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit, I come through to spit clips
(Call the mеchanic, niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this
I'm the mechanic

With a hard head; a nigga hеad open, he soft
I provide these services, we breaking them off
I'm a familiar face from the land of the lost
I used to be a worker bee, now a nigga a boss
It's like every now and then I'm back to being a mechanic
I split a nigga head, I'm a grease monkey with it
My momma told me "Baby Boy, the Lord going to bless us"
The dope bought us shit the food stamps couldn't get us
Man, they don't understand, we were just trying to make it
But where I'm from, when you want shit, you got to take it
I'm a Trojan of War, I get it done like Achilles
My Tre Pound will cut a nigga down on the str-id-eets (streets)
I never had drama with Spics, Jews, or GuineasBut once over a bitch a nigga tried to kill me
I was coming out his projects, I let off the semi
You ask 'em out in Edgemere, they know me
You might also like
I'm the mechanic, I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit, I come through to spit clips
(Call the mechanic, niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this
I'm the mechanic, I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit, I come through to spit clips
(Call the mechanic, niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this
I'm the mechanic

We don't play that pussy shit, we move on them
We put that work in, nigga, we move on them
Shorty, I know you ain't scared, we move on them
Here, the hammer right here, now move on them

Niggas is loose, I grab the cig and tighten niggas up
I lost my path in the dark, I'm lighting niggas up
I'm the school yard with your kid playing dodge ball
Then out come the hammer, can shorty dodge those?
I got a few screws missing, maybe even a bolt
A few shooters with me, down to go for the fall
I say "Get'em!" they get to killing like I'm running the court
Then get down with these around. The hulks in your throat
This is not amateur night and this ain't the Apollo
Ain't nothing saying the sun is coming out tomorrow
Your arm is broke and the promise of Death is coming
So if you want for me that homicide, I'm gunning
I'm the mechanic, I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit, I come through to spit clips
(Call the mechanic, niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this
I'm the mechanic, I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit, I come through to spit clips
(Call the mechanic, niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this
I'm the mechanic

Money buys guns, paranoia comes
When the drama comes, go ahead pussy run
Friends turned foes, Daddy girl's turn hoes
In the penitentiary hearts turn cold
Some turn snitch for State's evidence
While the big boys with the blow keep getting rich
When the drama comes they way they don't fucking panic
They hop on the phone quick to holler at mechanics

I'm the mechanic, I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit, I come through to spit clips
(Call the mechanic, niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this
I'm the mechanic, I use the hammer to fix shit
I be on that sick shit, I come through to spit clips
(Call the mechanic, niggas on that snitch shit
Talking that slick shit)
I know how to fix this
I'm the mechanicEmbed
