Man, fuck that, fuck that
Metro in this bitch goin' brazy (Yeah)

Comin' out of Jonesboro South (Ayy)
Nigga havin' golds all through they mouth, yeah
Lifetime goals (Woo), runnin' through the roof (Wha'?)
Pullin' out the Ghost (Grah), make a nigga poof (Grah)
Niggas talkin' shit but what is it to do?
I knew his big homie, nigga, and I got the proof (Woo)
My spot is a army base and I got the proof (What up?)
Send my bitch on vacay, put her in a coupe

Change the channel, I don't wanna see none these pussy niggas (Nah)
I've been fuckin' niggas' bitches and gettin' plenty figures
On the road to riches and got the realest with us
Slaughter Gang wit' me, nigga, knives, not a scissors
Street nigga with a bunch of lives like a tiger (Yeah)
Y'all niggas just a bunch of dykes fuckin' niggas
Nigga told and hе was my homie, I can't miss him
Ain't nobody feel him
Tell me what you seen, what you saw
I donе ran it up, I'm guessin' which broad
I'ma take her home tonight
I'm tryna see who I'm takin' home tonight
I seen a jawn gettin' shot at the light (Yeah-yeah)
They got to arguin' over new crack pipe (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I call the seamstress, my pants ain't tight enough
None of my bitches tell me I'm not man enough
What the fuck wrong with these broke-ass niggas? Yeah (Yeah)
I told 'em, "Tear it down"
I'ma think you pocket watchin', don't look at my pants now
My diamonds louder than the fuckin' ambulance now
Asked the bitch from the sidelines, "Stand down"
Runnin' through the projects, duckin' all the frauds, yeah
Got a nine in my pocket and not in my drawls (Woah-woah-woah)
Take off like a rocket with thirteen broads (Yeah)
**** in the attic, put the racks in the walls (Yeah)
No need to talk to me, I'm big dawg (Yeah)
I roll the windows up (Yeah) and now they knowin' us
I'm no beginner, yeah, I got my stain up
I told her, "Giddy up"
We ran the train on her
