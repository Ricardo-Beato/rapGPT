24 ContributorsWet LyricsBig Snoop Dogg
Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?
So I can lick you up
Make you give it up, give it up
Til you say my name
Like a jersey, jersey
Shittin' down the game
Be my head coach
So you can put me in
And never take me off
Til you can taste the win
Do it again and again
Til you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad that you came
Tell me baby are you wet
I'm gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet
Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip

Don't drown
Call me up
I can save you now
Lick your feet and kiss your mouth
Swisha sweet, I got you out
There's only one way we can stop the drought
Come with me take a trip down south
I can tell she's thirsty
I'm in the hole like a birdie
What you wanna do tonight
It's still early
Wanna get spewed tonight
She's all sturdy
I'm in between your lips
Like a cigarette
She wanna quit
But she wanna make it, make it, make it wet
I'm gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet
Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip
Can you, can you get me up?
Like I'm late for my first class
So I can give it to you rough
Like a first draft
Hold you like a paper plane
You know I got paper babe
But fuck them dollar bills
Girl make it rain
Holiday Inn, come
Meet me on the 8th floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though
And I, apologize
But when I slip inside I turn girls into slip n slide
It's a flood in your heart love
Girl let me pop up in your hot tub
Every night every day
Sippin' on a different drink
Different chicks different days
I do it different ways
Where you going
What'd you say
I want her river flowing to another lake
Another ocean another ocean
On the beach on the beach
I'm bout to take a swim
Let let me dip my feet and get wet
I wanna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet
Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip
Drip drip, drip, drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip2Embed
