I can't take one Percocet, start tonight off, I just took a 60
Burberry on me, shoot you in your back, you just got Pretty Ricky
I tie the Chanel runners, then I get back to running the city
And I know that it's hell coming, I ain't worried, my niggas, they with me
Gotta put the narcotics down, I can feel 'em fucking up my kidney
And punching my liver
If I let it kill me, my mama'll never forgive me
Ain't numbing my feelings, if I let it kill 'em, my baby will never forgive me
This remind me of hell, sometimes I wonder if that's where God really sent me

Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn

The truth hurts, let it bleed out, if they hurt you, let 'em leave
My heart hurtin', let me bleed out, only way I'll find peace
I'm tryna get set free, but these chains on me
Choke me, I can't breathe, what's reality?
Uh, detached from myself
Uh-huh, numb the pain with my wealth
Uh, a bag from Chanel match the double C on my belt, uh
Bands in my pants, I barely be holdin' my pants up
But the money ain't the answer
I'm just tryna reach some new highs
Mix this with that, bet it feel nice
Codeine, only sip if I got ice
Look my girl in her eyes, tell her I won't die
I fell asleep too deep that one time
Woke up to your cry, girl, I'm fine
But I lied
Had a dream, I wasn't gon' wake up this time

Outside those walls, there's a ocean, I can't swim

I'm walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata

So it's getting hard to drive, anxiety at a stoplight
Hard to think, easy to cry, that's how I know something's not right
Numb the pain with fun times, supermotos, Perc lines
Remember that one time everything was alright

Forever is a long, long time from tonight (Oh-ooh)

When it's dark outside, you're always the light (Oh, yeah)
This heart of mine was once cold as the ice (Oh-oh), oh-oh
The more I try, the more I open my mind
For you to find the demons hidin' deep inside

I owe fines, the devil say I owe him for life
But I could feel it, I got God on my side
Remember when He sent you to me that night
I had to cuff you up like a cop on a heist
Cupid is the judge, so I must testify
I won't move or budge, I'll stand by you for life
All my life, when you die is when I die
I sometimes wonder why
We argue and fight
And quickly make things right
It's probably 'cause we gotta grow more over time
Wouldn't be real love without rough nights
Can't feel these drugs, but I feel your eyes
When you look at mine, things feel alright (Oh-oh)

When it's dark outside, you're always the light (Oh, yeah)
This heart of mine was once cold as the ice (Oh-oh), oh-oh

It's really rare that you feel the real love feelin'
Some people get hurt and never love again
Some people get hurt and give the drugs a binge
Some people get dressed and go and hit the club to mend
There's no love in one-night stands, but you can play pretend
And me, I may admit it
All of these hoes, one thing that's pretentious
And if I know one thing, then I know this
It's us forever, worse or better, no discussion, that's how I'm comin' (Oh-oh)

What do you see in Juice WRLD?

You just brought him out on stage in front of all these people
I see you said he is like the best freestyler alive
He like
He like that 2009 or 2000, he probably like the 2006, maybe 2006 to 2009 Lil Wayne
He that, he that nigga
And then they seen him do the, uh
He'll do another version of the song freestyle
He did like three, three, four songs
Over one beat
All freestyle, like which one we like?

Congratulations on your...
Yo, shoutout to Juice too, man

He like, his, his freestyle he did on Westwood
Where he rapped for an hour, like what the fuck?
And to be so young
He like mastered that so fucking quickly
Yeah
It's really sad man, that, that
Like his potential was so off the charts

Period
You know who the best freestyler I've ever seen is?
Yeah?
Juice WRLD
Juice, yeah
Have you ever seen his freestyles?
Yeah
They're, they're so, they're never-ending
He can do it for like an hour
Ju-ice, yeah
And he makes total sense the entire time
And is actually really, like good, like intricate flow patterns
He, like to me, he was the best freestyler I've ever seen
And he was like the best hitmak- he was like
I really feel like he was the most talented, eh, like songwriter in music
If, I can't imagine there just goin' in there and doin' one-
Juice did that, my friend, Benny worked with Juice
Yeah
And he would say, he would go in the booth
Go three minutes over the beat, and it be a hit
And then he said, "Okay, another one"
And then he'd go three minutes over the beat
And it be a different hit
Shit
And then he'd be like, "Just pick whatever version you want"
He would tell Benny to cut it up?
No, not even cut it up, just like pick
Like, which hit do you want?
He freestyled- the whole song is freestyled
Ugh
Hits
Ugh
Like smash hits
How, how, how?
I sit in my room for six months and write a verse
This guy goes in there and it's four minutes and it's a smash
I think, like, what
What Juice was to our generation, bro
And the impact that he had on us is what Biggie did for New York, for real
Like, I really think, um

I don't know, music is just a beautiful thing, like I love myself so much, as far as the way I make music, the way God made me, the way God wired me to do the things that I do, and to change the world the way that I can
I think you're an agent of change, I think you're touchin' in a way this generation that very few, if no one else, can
Before I get up out of here, I wanna tell you that you can do anything you put your mind to, period
As long as you work hard, give it your all and don't listen to what anybody got to say, it's your world, you can do what you want, on bro, period

If that's true, then take these .223's and let's see (Brrt, brrt)
Do what you wanna, if you got the money
Just pray that your niggas remain ten toes down
Through all the shit, through all the hits
Through all the misses, through all the differences
We all different, only God knows, he's omniscient
Nigga, I know, I'm the shit, so I don't let a fuck nigga catch me slippin'
Ridin' around with my clique (Oh, yeah)
Now if you take the L, you took and add it to it, bitch, we lit
I'm thanking God, I'm not selling no bricks
If it's ever a problem, I'ma call up the problem solvers
They pull up and put a hole in your wig
Yeah, you and your friends, you kill our vibe, we kill yo' mans
Damn that, we gon' spray the whole scene, then slide back
I just spend the whole thing on a Chanel bag
But it still ain't put a dent in my stack, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh

Did it on my own, I'ma do my own thing
Put my mama in a mansion, had to relocate
Remember playing hide and seek in a crawl space
Now I could play it in a sixteen-room by the lake
Real estate is an investment, house is in the A
Try to block me from my blessin', get shot in the face
With a .40 Smith & Wesson, I'm a fool with the aim, aim

She said it's not enough
Oh-oh-oh, uh

Now I've been drownin' in this liquor bottle, but drowning's not enough
They tell me that I won't live to see tomorrow, but I don't give a fuck
I'm running out of patience, out of pleasure, and runnin' out of luck
I'm really scared that we won't stay together
What if you run out of your love? You run out of your love

I hope you know, if I said it, baby, I meant it
Straight lovers, we ain't goin' to a friendship
Fell for you, I don't know how it happened (Uh)
When we kissin', I taste all the passion
Time worth more than money, but I'll spend
All of it on you, me and you, until the end
No talking, baby, I'm about that action
All these othеr hoes are so irrelеvant, honest
You taught me what real love is

Now I've been drownin' in this liquor bottle, but drowning's not enough
They tell me that I won't live to see tomorrow, but I don't give a fuck
I'm running out of patience, out of pleasure, and runnin' out of luck
I'm really scared that we won't stay together

My bad for all of the stressful times that we had
I know you scared that I'm gon' relapse, I love that
Where the drugs at? You know that I love that
Let's go out tonight, where the clubs at?
Endless drugs, I remember dub sacks in my blunts
Now we sippin' Wock' out a double cup, yeah
That's codeine love
You fill me up like the drugs do
Ink on my brain like a tattoo
Glad we ain't meet in high school
Wasn't real love in high school

Now I've been drownin' in this liquor bottle, but drowning's not enough
They tell me that I won't live to see tomorrow, but I don't give a fuck

What if you run out of your love? You run out of your love

I think once I took my first Vicodin, it was just like, this feeling of, "Ahh"
You know, like everything was not only mellow, but didn't feel any pain
It just didn't–, it just kind of numbed things
I don't know at what point exactly it started to be a problem
I just remember likin' it more and more
People tried to tell me that I had a problem
They act all tough, but in person, they be murmuring
And mumbling, pull a gun out, they get to stumbling, tumbling
And the chopper get to thundering
Shitting on all these haters, like, where the plunger at?
I'm excited, 'cause now I can throw a party and all the people that hated on me won't be invited
True Religion on me like the Buddha, Indian style, I'm enlightened
I rеmember up in kindergartеn, the teacher told me I wouldn't be shit
And then she saw me play the piano and made all the other kids sea sick
Even though I got a couple demons, I'm still screaming out, "Thank Jesus"
Upside down pyramid on me just to compliment the Jesus pieces
I was a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh, that's why I pull cards on these stupid hoes
Got a arrow, not a bullet, Cupid ho, ha, yeah
I pop Perc's to numb all the pain 'cause it hurt to live
I gotta take everything 'cause sometimes it hurt to give
I make money even though sometimes it don't make sense
Speaking of taking everything, it's time to take shits on every single person that said I wouldn't do it
Every single person that said I was stupid
Every single person that said I was that Netflix special, what's the name of the show? Ah, Clueless
But no, I ain't clueless, I got this
I'm on top so now nobody can top this
Now it's time to change the topic
I got a way with words, like I'm running with a phonics book
In school I didn't do the homework but I still got the subjects
Money ain't the object, money is the objective, gotta admit that
I'm successful but I feel like my head sometimes a little dreadful
I grew up on rock, rap, heavy metal
Now I'm ridin' bikes, pedal to the metal
I don't even gotta pedal, it's a throttle, so excuse me
These niggas faker than some optical illusions
I be looking like, "What the fuck is you doing?"
You ain't getting money, you ain't changing shit, you ain't changing the world, you just stupid
Talkin' bout you crackin' cards, selling drugs, killing niggas, and going hard
Watch a real nigga come up in your car, now you lookin' all scared
Finna piss yourself, shit yourself, you gotta admit yourself, you need some help
I gotta admit myself, I'm on these drugs, feel like I can't save myself
Sometimes I wanna take myself and break myself, so I can reshape myself, huh
Nobody ever felt the pain I felt, so I share it
Put it out to the whole world, I ain't embarrassed
Bunch of these niggas is my sons
I apologize to 'em cause I been a bad parent
Don't try me 'cause I'm not the one, see I won't even count to twoYou might also like14Embed
