Haha uh
Yeah, uh
Yeah, Yo
Bear with a nigga man
Gotta a little head cold, ya know?
I'll still kill it nigga
Show y'all niggas how it do
Real Quick

Uh You know what they say;
The window to the soul is in the eyes
So disrespect a nigga, I will close a nigga blinds
Yeah who can hold us? Super focused
Shoot them hoes with the Super Soakers
I got 'em so wet
Fuck that Moet, I'm Hennessy drinking
Wonder what my enemies' thinking
Nervous? nigga, please
I'm finna be caking with dough-
So much bread, its like a nigga be baking
Watch so cold, it's like the shit will need blankets
Money coming soon, tell my niggas be patient
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones
Hit and run, bigger funds
But still can't forget to pour liquor
As I reminisce on them niggas that couldn't come
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny
So I do what's best for me
I know you fake niggas well, ain't no test to me
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe for that
So nigga chill or the tec will speak, "Blaaat!"
Them niggas will put you chest to feet
I'm talking reckless
What you expect nigga, I'm flexing
Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted
'Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted
What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us
Looking for model divas that barely speak English
Fuck 'em while we rich, 'cause when we broke, they gonna leave us
We earn stripes, looking like zebras
Y'all looking like Adidas
We do it for the streets, cuz they need us
Got beef? Come meet us
Ok I thought so
Y'all niggas are so mad cuz I floss so bad on bitches
And with this stroke, I'm Picasso
Make her stomach feel the fossil
Now she yelling out God so much thought I had her singing gospel
Shit, shout out to my apostles
Ya know me
Nicest nigga in the south
Yea you can quote me!
