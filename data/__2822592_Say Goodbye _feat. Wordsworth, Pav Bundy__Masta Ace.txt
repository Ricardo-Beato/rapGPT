Say goodbye to yesterday (Say goodbye to yesterda-a-ay)
It only last for a minute
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Living in the present da-a-ay
I'm just glad to be in it

Say goodbye to yesterday
Say goodbye to last year
This be the present can't be living in the past here
Say goodbye to everything you ever thought was sacred
Living how you living how would ever thought you'd make it
Say Goodbye to honesty, say goodbye to purity
Say goodbye to confidence, welfare and security
Say goodbye to energy, youth, and vitality
Say goodbye to everything grounded in morality
This a new reality
Say goodbye to memories
Now you in the club and you party with the enemies
Walking with the centipedes
Now we on our last legs
Bent ends of knees little boy from the past begs
Please don't let it disappear, please don't let it go away
Say goodbye to talent as they write another throwaway
Everything blow away
Got to wear some chains, gotta say goodbye but its feeling kind of strange

What's up (What's up)
What's up (What's up)
What's up (What's up)
What's up (What's up)
What's up (What's up)
What's up (What's up)
What's up (What's up)

Say goodbye to yesterday (Say goodbye to yesterda-a-ay)
It only last for a minute
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Living in the present da-a-ay
I'm just glad to be in it

Say goodbye to dropping quarters in the penny arcade
Now we sipping henny trying to get this ?
All we know is negative say goodbye to positive
Say goodbye to fucks cuz, that ain't what we got to give
Say goodbye to sanity, all we know it vanity'
Drunk at the club and hung over like a canopy
Say goodbye to clear minded thinking and sobriety
Say goodbye to yesterday this is our society
Say goodbye to innocence, say goodbye to pride
Everything that make up who we are we try to hide
Hide behind the fake, and our fate is on the fringes
We just wanna turn up and ride around with Benz's
Say goodbye to who we knew exactly were are friends is
Say goodbye to all the kings, queens, and all the princes
And the princesses, say goodbye to the, songs with heartfelt words with messages
Yeah
Everything (everything)
Before we don't look back now
Don't tell em what the rain will bring
Long as the sun come back out
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Say goodbye to marriage and 2 parent homes
With the father and the baby in the carriage ?
Sayonara to the lawyers helping the poorer
Fair trial, prosecutors, judges, and jurors
As ta la-vista to moms, pops and the preachers
The churches, the good teachers, The cops that policed us
Adios to putting faith in putting stock in hope
Community, unity, everybody close'
Deuces to what truth is, and where the youth is
Innocent before guilty, what proof is
Ciao, to good manners, beginning grammar
Good grammar with grandpa shopping with nana
See ya later, the phone booths, reading the paper
The buses and subways being safer
Farewell to hanging in the stairwells
Life lessons prepared well
In due time ?
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Say goodbye to yesterday (Say goodbye to yesterda-a-ay)
It only last for a minute
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Living in the present da-a-ay
I'm just glad to be in it

Now listen
Hurry up, get showered, and get out of here
It'll be dark in less than an hour
Be careful going home, especially you guys taking the bus
We've had a few incidents this month on that B44
I don't want to get a call in the middle of the night, so look after each other
Alright bring it in
