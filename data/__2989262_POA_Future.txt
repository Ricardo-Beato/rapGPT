Oh yeah, Super Super
Astronaut, yeah

Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
Shit gettin’ too specific
10 black whips, I'm too consistent
To my foreign bitches, tell me if I'm too persistent (Foreign, foreign)
All my baby mamas, I just bought ‘em brand new Benzes
I need a power of attorney (Whoa)
I'm 'bout to fuck up some M's (Brr, brr)
I need a power of attorney (Hol' up, hol' up)
You need to get this on film (Whoa, whoa)
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith (Wraith)
You won't catch me in the gym (You won't catch me in the gym)
I'm 'bout to push me some weight (Weight)
