Uh-um (Bongo By The Way)
Ayy

Stop playin', I'm tryna see what's up with it (What's up)
I'm Thee Stallion, I'm tryna get buck with it (Ah)
He dickin' me down so good (Yeah), tryna reach my soul (Yeah)
Like you wanna get in touch with it (Yeah)
I'm a real freak bitch from the H, you dig?
"Did you really do a nigga dirty?" I did (I did)
If you got a child, don't bring it over here
I don't need a Plan B, swallow your kids
Tall and chocolate, what I like (What I like)
Come over and spend the night (Yeah)
Know you want a bitch this fly (Uh-huh)
It ain't nothin' but a flight (But a flight)

I know I be talkin' shit (Talkin' shit)

From the H, so I wanna come down on it
Throw it back, make a nigga throw the towel on it

Nigga, what you wanna do? (Ah)
You could eat this pussy real good (Uh-huh)
Or stay at home and starve, you choose (You choose)
Lickin' my crack, gotta call that boy a crackhead (Yeah)
Nigga want a buffet, come and get in my bed (My bed)
I know it ain't close to Thanksgiving
But on the table where I wanna get stuffed at
You know my birthday the same month as Valentine's

If you can't give me the time (Ooh)
Then, baby, you can't be mine
Got a million just like you waiting in line
Good D ain't hard to find (Oh)
Miss me with the wishy-washy in and out my life
Only in and out I need is still between these thighs
It's the loyalty I like
And I'm like, "All night, if you got it, you got it"
Yeah, from L.A. so I got a lot of thug in me
It's okay, baby, you ain't gotta front with me
So, bae, when I say, give me what I need
Dick and consistency (Yeah, yeah)
Boy, I know you feelin' me (I know; Yeah)
Fuck all them other hoes (All them other hoes)
Give me dick consistently (Whoa; Ah)
