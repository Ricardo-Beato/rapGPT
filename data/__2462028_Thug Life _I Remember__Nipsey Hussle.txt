18 ContributorsThug Life (I Remember) Lyrics
Turn me up some
Nips! Let's hustle
Look what up
Thug! Sip on Actavis

Was on my grind, it was my time
I ain't think twice, I paid that price and we did this, nigga
Reached every goal I actually set
I had to sit back down and rearrange that list, nigga
And now I'm out here gettin' rich
You know a nigga gotta talk my shit
And we out here gettin' rich
You know a nigga gotta talk my shit
Thug

I'm still flexin', bitch I'm the flyest
No cereal but she like my pops
I just might drop her down from the sky
Nipsey got birdies, ya he supplyin', baby
Hustle's been clean like I got Tide in it baby
Ass so fat she got Stevie eyein' it, baby
What!?
And I'm attracted to the green like the Navy
Baby bottles, no babies
Milkin' all these bitches like they pregnant, patience
And I'm the type of nigga that'll get mad about what you sayin'
So watch what you sayin'
Cause I keep neighbors with me, B
Woah, I'm on that small, I need double d's
Lots of sisters and brothers so they never notice me
Nipsey!

Was on my grind, it was my time
I ain't think twice, I paid that price and we did this, nigga
Reached every goal I actually set
I had to sit back down and rearrange that list, nigga
And now I'm out here gettin' rich
You know a nigga gotta talk my shit
And we out here gettin' rich
You know a nigga gotta talk my shit

Police throw 'em at me, charges never stick
Fuckin' niggas up in Vegas like Pac in '96
11 past 11, she told me make a wish
Told me, "Past the blunt, you always tryna neck this shit
Posted at the Shell, leanin' on my shit
Bitches pullin' up we like a hundred somethin' thick
Dice game crackin', threw a hundred licks
Now a nigga gotta talk my shit
When I was lookin' for a pot to piss
Posted on the block with all my Crips
Thought a hundred racks was gettin' rich
Risk a hundred years to hit a lick
They said it take patience to get rich
But I always knew one day I would do it big, then I did
Was on my grind, it was my time
I ain't think twice, I paid that price and we did this, nigga
Reached every goal I actually set
I had to sit back down and rearrange that list, nigga
And now I'm out here gettin' rich
You know a nigga gotta talk my shit
And we out here gettin' rich
You know a nigga gotta talk my shit
Thug!

I'm still flexin', bitch I'm the flyest
No cereal but she like my pops
I just might drop her down from the sky
Nipsey got birdies, ya he supplyin', baby
Hustle's been clean like I got Tide in it baby
Ass so fat she got Stevie eyein' it, baby
What!? Hahaha
And I'm attracted to the green like the Navy
Baby bottles, no babies
Milkin' all these bitches like they pregnant, patience
And I'm the type of nigga that'll get mad about what you sayin'
So watch what you sayin'
Cause I keep neighbors with me, B
Woah, I'm on that small, I need double d's
Lots of sisters and brothers so they never notice me
Nipsey!1Embed
