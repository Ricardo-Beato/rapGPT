These streets is harder than your diamonds
You representing gangsta, but that ain't got a damn thing to do with rhyming
Ain't nothing wrong with shining
But get right, 'cause you'll never see your light if your iggnerance is blinding
You significantly grinding
You love the hustle, but be warned, the hustle  muscle  infinantly binding
Have you tell it to the concreet
But is the pimpin and the robbin and the killin and the trappin just for drum beats?
You know your trials and your hardships
Well for a better reason then the treson, you can  talking hard shit
Ain't no hating, I got love for you
For twenty years, I been going way beyond and above for you
The streets is where I got respect at
Where I got my stripes, and Wikipedia can't check that
So come down off your high horse
And give back to the hood, our communities is 
Jail ain't  one man
We in a world where you can die for being born with a suntan
The game's a lesson, if you studdy long
You can live the kind of life to make a nigga wanna write a song
But too long and you study wrong
I'm just speaking what I know, never preaching, I ain't 
The future us need leadership
I just keep it one thousand
You might also like
Statistics say you could be a dope boy
It ain’t easy as it look boy
Them niggas gonna bit your swagger
Won’t be the first nigga to bite you, won’t be the last motherfucker don’t like you
Be prepared for the worses, we prepared for the worses

For statistics and what they said I’m a rich nigga
Some niggas get money go to feds get out rich nigga
My uncle left came back to the streets and got his check
Presidential Rolex, Versace specs, I’m flyer than a jet
Its in my flesh and bones I wake up on that strong
Fuck what you thank about it you think its wrong
You politicians politicin’ about niggas getting it
Making niggas successful you tryna make niggas stressful
Its a side of me to be a hot commodity
Fuck a robbery I take them on violently
For biting me I should sent my whole army
For making futuristic sounds so corny

Statistics say you could be a dope boy
It ain’t easy as it look boy
Them niggas gonna bit your swagger
Won’t be the first nigga to bite you, won’t be the last motherfucker don’t like you
Be prepared for the worses, we prepared for the worses
Bitch ass niggas smell like a dust
Wack ass friends gone fuck around and expose you
Nobody to hand around school of swag and jackers
Got your cap and gown go around sniffin’ real niggas down
The green light on you in own just to lay you down
Smoking out a pound waiting on a call about a clown
Money on your forehead fuck you lil niggas kickin’ big talk
Fuck that small talk turn a loft to a vault
4s Panamera Turbo Porsche
Do it for my niggas in the streets of course, with no choice
But you go and get that mula fetti no choice
But you go and get that mula fetti no choice

Statistics say you could be a dope boy
It ain’t easy as it look boy
Them niggas gonna bit your swagger
Won’t be the first nigga to bite you, won’t be the last motherfucker don’t like you
Be prepared for the worses, we prepared for the worsesEmbed
