38 ContributorsJackie Chan Lyrics
Jackie Chan glasses, Rush Hour traffic
Buffie the Body, the buffer the fattest
Hitted the fool now he riding in the trunk
Rumpin & Bumpin I might hit a bump
A million a month is a lost to a boss
Don’t pass me the blunt because I’m in a slump
Biggin' and juggin', bitch what do you want
I’m credit for dope til' the first of the month
Smoking a blunt and my trunk in the front
You like it or leave it, or leave it alone
Slick with the stick and I’m cool with the chrome
One hit of the bong and I leave it alone
Lean and Patron, I know that it’s wrong
I know that it’s wrong but I jugg on the phone
The day that it came, the day that it gone
Day to day business, cause dope with a tone
Gucci and Ziggy, we back in the business
My pockets my piggy, I’m back on my throne

My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan
You might also like
Jackie Chan, diamond wrists, kicking like Liu Kang
Bruce Wayne, Bentley coupe, karate chop my brain
Alligator bally, Versace, Versace, Versace my ring
The j’s they love the cocaine
They sniffing the dope off my ring
You know that I’m a magician
The packs I get it and flip it
This lean is killing my kidneys
These birds are singing like Whitney

Call me Jackie, my diamonds kicking,
I Came a long way from that midget
To pullin' up in Honda Civics
To dropping that top on my Bentley
Them Rush Hour I'm gettin' them Benji
I’m smoking on Jackie, my eyes is chinky
My money is long like a slinky
I fuck with a bitch look like Pinky
I’m Jackie Chan in my city
Where ever I go, I’m good, I can kick it

My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan
My eyes look like Jackie Chan ‘cause I smoke that mary jane
My eyes look so Asian, man, ‘cause I’m smoking that purple thing
Gucci Mane got stupid Jordans
My kick game on Jackie Chan
Me, Chris Tucker, ride through Tucker
Got pulled over, cause we’re two black brothers
Chris Tucker stop laughin' man
This shit here ain’t funny man
Rush Hour traffic, smoking that cabbage
Two diamond rings, they Jackie Chan
Gucci got hands like Jackie Chan
Better yet, nigga Chuck Norris
Nigga told me he was back balling
Two weeks later he was back borrowin
Jackie Chan bitch, my bitch ballin'
Jackie Chan bitch, my bitch foreign
Put your hands up for the black man
Keep your eyes up for the black fan
Gucci Mane and Zay, we back man
Not Pac-Man, it’s Jackie Chan

My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan21Embed
