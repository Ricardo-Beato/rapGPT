25 ContributorsNever Die Lyrics
Change is coming, change is here

Holla if you hear me
In the memory of 2Pac sincerely
Been a G, since standing four feet on the monkey bars
Steal a nigga's box like it was ours
Cars roll up, Nah we don't fold up
We just hold up our guns like championship cigars
Mama hold the porch sipping OE out of a straw
I remember it all, them early Compton days
Shit, I put my all in them high school hallways
Montgomery never saw the dime bags
Finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over
Now what's over I'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage
Never came in the truck no more, we back seat
Times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance
If you're shot in the heart bleeding
Ouch

It's gutter when the sun come up
When the sun go down
Nothing but tears, no onions
Under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come
Don't go looking for it
Don't look like you hard
You're better off looking foreign, I'm warnin' ya
Before that warm temperature warmin' up
Your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners
The neighbors is listeners
I'm the future of the new west for you visitors
Never mind them other niggas
I'm talkin' in particular
Just cause you got the flu don't mean you're sick enough
I'm igloo cold with it
If California snows then I did it
The 21st of June I'll make a blizzard
The OG aim they guns at the moon
Bullets break through the atmosphere
Fear no man but God, the God of rap is here
And I can see you scared (whew)
You might also like
Real gangsters either dead or in jail
And you don't look like a zombie and I don't see no cells
I sink niggas blackships, he won't sail
And his album really ain't shit, he won't sell
And I had that mind state since twelve
No skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats
5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math
That's 19 hours lost, I got insomnia bad
But, I can't complain or happen to think it too much, came passion Albert Einstien gained
Had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking ?
This business got too many villians
Superman is back
The cape ain't red, it's black
That's a trench coat
And the note for your information if we was dead this recarnation
Watch your heads3Embed
