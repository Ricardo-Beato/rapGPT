I got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
I really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm 'bout
Really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm 'bout
I got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
Catch me at the studio or at the trap house
Pull up right now, I'll serve you right now

Pull up in a 'Rari, pull up on a Harley
Hanging out the window
.223 it hit like; pew-pew, pew-pew
Bitch, I'm posted in the VIP
With the drank sipping sip
Nigga know that, when I pull up they gon' dip (They gon' dip)
When I pull it off the hip, I'ma hit (I'ma hit)
I don't give a fuck about a bitch, nigga, fuck a bitch
I'm a Slaughter Gang, Savage, niggas know we with the shit
All my Murder Gang niggas pulling up they with the shit
All my Billy Bros pulling up and hopping out with sticks
Since a youngin' I been thuggin', I been flipping fuckin' clips
You might also like
I got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
I really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm 'bout
Really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm 'bout
I got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
Catch me at the studio or at the trap house
Pull up right now, I'll serve you right now

Bitch, I'm gang, gang, what I claim, claim
Nigga, bang, bang, got a stain, stain
Hit 'em with that .223, now that shit stain, stain
I pull up on your wife, you know I'm fuckin' on your main
Diamonds on my ring, pinky ring, bling
Watch, chain, ring, nigga, you can't hang
You know I sell cocaine, fuckin' on a nigga bitch
And then I pulled up in that 'Rari, then I left in that M6
Bitch, I'm really in the six, and all my niggas with the shit
All my niggas selling bricks, walking 'round with extended clips
Young nigga ready to trip, young nigga get you hit
Five-thousand dollar, nigga, get a pussy nigga killed

I got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
I really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm 'bout
Really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm 'bout
I got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
Catch me at the studio or at the trap house
Pull up right now, I'll serve you right now4Embed
