Now I got fucking wings
(Now I got my wings and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Now I got fucking wings
Young nigga Red Bull after me, now I got fucking wings

Shouldn't've gave a young nigga Red Bull (Red Bull)
Now I got my fucking wings (Now I got fucking wings, ayy)
Nigga say he gon' defeat me (Wow)
In his fucking dreams (Motherfuckin' dreams, lil' nigga)
Bitch say she wanna sleep with me (She sleep with me)
I only sleep with the cream, ayy (Only sleep with boss, lil' nigga)
Bitch, look at my watch, how it's glistening (Bling blaow)
Look like I'm whippin' cream (Whip, woah, lil' nigga)

Gold watch (Gold watch), white diamonds (White diamonds, bling)
Johnny Dang, white shining (White shining, bling)
Gold chain (Gold chain), white diamonds (White diamonds, bling)
Gold diamonds (Gold diamonds), I'm a diamond (I'm a diamond, bang)
Sneak diss, white liners (Bang)
Never on time (Bang), but it's right timing (Gang)
Fee shit (Yeah), I be slamming (Yeah)
Eating every fucking day (Visa)
Bitch, I lease shit (Lease it)
Bitch, I need some credit (I need it)
Pull off in that anything (Any fuckin' thing)

Pull up in that 2020 flexing (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
