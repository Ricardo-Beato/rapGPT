2 ContributorsThe Prayer LyricsSometimes I feel like he don't hear me
Sometimes I wonder, do he love me
Life is so hard for me
This ain't the way it's supposed to be
I pray every night asking for forgiveness
Sometimes ask myself is it worth it
Life is so pain, painful
Yet I'm so thank, thankful
Life won't be easy and I know that
My past is over, wish I can go back
Maybe I'll change it
Rearrange it
Sometimes in life we all feel like we've fallen
Those who suffer in life will be rewarded
Lord I hear you but it's so hard being strong
I keep reminiscing all my loved ones that are gone
He said "Son, you should know you're born to die"
I said "I do, it's just so hard saying bye"
That's why I feel like, you don't hear me
Sometimes I wonder, do you love me
Life is so hard for me
This ain't the way it's supposed to beYou might also likeEmbed
