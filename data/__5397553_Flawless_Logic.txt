Baby girl, you're flawless
She say she can take all this rawness
No title, don't know what to call this
I'm honest
I can't promise we gon' go beyond this
But girl, you gon' get it regardless, you're flawless (Flawless, yeah)
She say she can take all this rawness
No title, don't know what to call this
I'm honest (I said she flawless, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't promise we gon' go beyond this
But girl, you gon' get it regardless, you're (Yeah, yeah, uh)

Take it back like '03, want the old me
What they told me but don't know me
Jump on it, make it pop back like you owe me
Don't stop that, just show me
I'm finna take off your chonies
Break it down, roll it up, baby girl, we gon' get stony
Never one to be phony
Yeah, we pour it up and then sip it slow
Change lanes when I whip it though
Step to the mic and I rip it though
They can't front 'cause they all know
I keep it trill like Mike Jones
I'm cinematic like Spike Jonze
Let's make a movie, make a movie
Haters talk but that go through me
I'ma throw you on the bed, then you throw me head
You heard what I said, damn right
Yeah, you know the deal, I'ma play the field
And you ain't go no man, right?
Can't fuck around wit' no stress
I give her the pipe, no less
I'ma put the pussy to the test
Say she feel it all in her chest 'cause she—
You might also like
Flawless (Flawless, yeah)
She say she can take all this rawness
No title, don't know what to call this
I'm honest (I said she flawless, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't promise we gon' go beyond this
But girl, you gon' get it regardless, you're flawless (Flawless, yeah)
She say she can take all this rawness
No title, don't know what to call this
I'm honest (I said she flawless, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't promise we gon' go beyond this
But girl, you gon' get it regardless, you're flawless

Oh, you thought I was done?

Bring it back one more 'gain again
I'm all in again
Fuck around it, I'ma get it in
Pour up some and get lit again
I think I got another hit again
Think the haters talkin' shit again
Fuck 'em though 'cause I'm too on like a lightswitch
Yeah, I turn her on like a lightswitch
Might fuck around and then take your bitch
Make her cum and she might twitch
She all on it, too fine
Nobody else, yeah, she too mine
I can't call it, she into me
But it ain't a wallet
But it's so odd when you so ballin'
'Cause it seem like every ho fallin', huh, yeah
That's why, that's why I can't fuck with no hoes
I said that's why, that's why I think everyone knows
I only want a good girl who give a fuck less 'bout all this
So I wrote this song for you, 'cause you're so fucking—
Flawless (Flawless, yeah)
She say she can take all this rawness
No title, don't know what to call this
I'm honest (I said she flawless, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't promise we gon' go beyond this
But girl, you gon' get it regardless, you're flawless (Flawless, yeah)
She say she can take all this rawness
No title, don't know what to call this
I'm honest (I said she flawless, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't promise we gon' go beyond this
But girl, you gon' get it regardless, you're flawless4Embed
