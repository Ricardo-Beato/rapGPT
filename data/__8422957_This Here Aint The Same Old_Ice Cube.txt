1 ContributorThis Here Aint The Same Old Lyrics
Party people
I said, party people
You know what the fuck to do

Hey!
Hey!
Hey, it is nice to meet ya
I am off the meter
Sittin' here with my feet up
I might Victor the Peter (woof)
They used to call me Simbo
Now I'm in a Lambo
Clean as Tony Randall (fresh)
Don't turn me to Rambo
Will make you an example
Have to blow out your candle
I am simply West Coast
And you better do what I say so

Hey!
Let me see ya goddamn ass up
Let me see ya goddamn hands up
Let me see you on that dance floor
Let me know, you know what you came fo'
Lеt me see ya goddamn ass up
Let me see ya goddamn hands up
Lеt me see you on that dance floor
Let me know, you know what you came fo'
Hey!
You might also like
I keep it strictly gangsta
And I like to thank ya
'Cause I ain't no angel
And this here ain't the same old
This here is the new flow
Your flow? Stuck in neutral
A nigga is high as Pluto
And still can't kick the juto

Let me see ya goddamn ass up
We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
Let me see ya goddamn hands up
Let me see you on that dance floor
We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
Let me know, you know what you came fo'
We rock the party, rock the partey
Hey!

Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it (hey!)
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it
I'm from California, with an ice-cold Corona
Baby, it was nice to know ya
But I got to bend a corner
'Cause I'm bout to hit the dance floor
Baby bout to get down, get low
Baby bout to get down, get low
DJ, please let that shit go

We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
We rock the party, rock the partey
Hey!

Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it (hey!)
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break it
Shake it with ya back, now break itEmbed
