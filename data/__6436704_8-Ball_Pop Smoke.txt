Ooh (Oh)
Ooh (Ayy)
Ooh

That was all profit, robbin', robbin', robbin' (Swizz got me singin', ha)
'Cause I never used to have nothin' (Nothin'), nothin' (Ooh), nothin' (Ooh)
Stay ten toes, ten toes (Oh), ten toes (Oh), ten toes (Ten)
Never used to have mine, it was all profit (Oh)
8-Ball, corner pocket (Oh)

Mama told me, "Keep your head above water", keep your head above water
Never take your first offer, it's gon' come around again
Ooh, always keep yourself in order, order, before somebody put you in order
8-Ball, corner pocket

(Yeah)
Know the Devil telling lies, he's there when I sleep, mm (Mm-mm)
Say you can't rewind in this life, but is it me? Oh, Lord (Mm-mm)
In my mind, simply saucing
I see, so sweet, and no
No, I couldn't make it running, life is too hard (Mm-mm)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Carrying on, look at us singing this song
Wonder what bleeds in the dark, and we ain't built to handle it all
Answer the call, are you hearin' me? Come and get involved, baby doll
Live a fast life, can't blame me
Ice blowing and I know I'm toe-to-toe in the fight
Dancing with the Devil, pray I make it alright (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
I don't know why, just a nigga living wild (Ooh-ooh)
8-Ball, corner pocket

That was all profit, robbin', robbin', robbin'
'Cause I never used to have nothin' (Nothin'), nothin' (Ooh), nothin' (Ooh)
Stay ten toes, ten toes (Oh), ten toes (Oh), ten toes (Ten)
Never used to have mine, that was all profit (Oh)
8-Ball, corner pocket (Oh)7Embed
