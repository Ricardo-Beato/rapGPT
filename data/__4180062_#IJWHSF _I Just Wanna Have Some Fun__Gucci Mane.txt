6 Contributors#IJWHSF (I Just Wanna Have Some Fun) Lyrics
Baby, what you on
Cause I just wanna have some fun
Lady, what you on
Cause I just wanna have some fun
I respect you busy baby, just hit my line later on
I don't wanna be your man, but I just wanna have some fun

Jump off the re-off, cop your hoe cause you old
Geekin off that Molly, bout to watch you and yo clothes
Told her don’t call me when you want me, baby, call me when you loanly
He make you feel some type of way, he see his hoe smokin with the homie
Rambo, Silvester Stalone, got blonds like Moses Malone
Sippin and smokin alone, drivin with your hoe on the phone
Cookie for Calone, smell like I be on strong
You wanna get back together, she want you to leave her alone
She catchin feelings, I'm makin her kill it
I'm whippin, she payin attention
Hit it from the back, for like 20 minutes
When she see me, she stand at attention
Everytime I fuck her, I give her a fix
Sippin and smokin out the zip
Gucci a trick, yeah, they callin me tricky
Grind on me, like Pretty Ricky
It’s Gucci!

Baby, what you on
Cause I just wanna have some fun
Lady, what you on
Cause I just wanna have some fun
I respect you busy baby, just hit my line later on
I don't wanna be your man, but I just wanna have some fun

Longway!
Baby, what you on, tryna fuck, I want some gum
Tryna smell all my Calone, new fragrents made by Bun
Type of shit I be on
Let me fuck, and the whole crew run
Treat you to wings and rice from Hun
Ride in the Coope with Longway Bun
Trappin out the plane with Peewee Longway
Landed on the runway with something forin
Type of shit I be on
Designer drugs, Balenciaga
I respect that you be busy baby, I just wanna have some fun
I got work that you can sell, baby, spend it on a new G 1
On the west coast, Longway Don Wan
Ain't tryna lay up, Longway already done
Out in south beach, turn my bricks to jewels, I got one
Next, wanna have some fun
Switch-a-roo, leave her wetter than a pond
Longway!
Baby, what you on
Cause I just wanna have some fun
Lady, what you on
Cause I just wanna have some fun
I respect you busy baby, just hit my line later on
I don't wanna be your man, but I just wanna have some funEmbed
