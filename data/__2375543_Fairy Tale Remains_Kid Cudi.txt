Tell 'em, tell 'em
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em

Cuts and burns (Cuts and burns)
Cuts and burns (Cuts and burns)
My turn (My turn)
Shove it, your fake concern (Fake concern)
The lesson deserved (Lesson deserved)
A lesson is learned (Lesson learned)
So much avoiding, memories fading
This shit is so weak, so weak
Suddenly, suddenly

Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are (Uh-huh)
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are

Nothing left (Nothing left)
There's nothing left (Nothing left)
Your turn (Your turn)
Shove it, your fake concern (Fake concern)
Fractured emotions (Fractured emotions)
Zero devotion (Zero)
The elements fading (Burden hazy)
Remains remaining (Remains remaining)
Oh, this is so us (So us, so us)
This is so us, unfortunately

Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are

No, no, no, he not quite sure what that is
Just kiss
No, no, he don't love him
No, no, he don't know what that is
No, no, she don't love her
No, no, she not quite sure what that is
Just kiss
