23 Contributors16 Fever Lyrics
I'm charging 16 fever, 16 fever, nigga my price cheaper, 16 fever

16 fever coca-ina
X pills, bubble kush, mid-grade reefer
Hoes ride dicks, dog, but I ride Beemers
A square rectangle cost 16 fever

16 5-0, there go 5-0
I'm up 2-5 but I need 4 more
I got uncles blowing bundles, mine do numbers while I drive lambo
Off-white yayo, digital scale
Fishscale sending my pigeons by mail
Bring in my drain folks, I just bring me that caine, folks
Gucci got good dope, pills, purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move nothing less than a bizzurd
Gucci got good dope, pills, purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move nothing less than a bizzurd


Bricks: can't keep em
16 fever, Beemer-speakers, geek-a-meters
Misdemeanors, several subpeonas
See, I'm gonna drink up cause we just linked up
The squad been teamed up, we cutting off fingers
It's 16 fever and that's since april
My Corvette paid for, my old-school paid for
The hummer roll up? That means you assed out
And you didn't cash out, see this my traphouse
I slam fiends backs out, we push white sacks out
See this my traphouse, I slam fiends backs out
We push white sacks out, them backs get pushed out

I'm scraping the bowl up, I'm whipping up cake mix
But this ain't red velvet! Don't eat it, you smoke it
Your options are open: you even can snort it!
3 dollar sacks so you know you can score it
Say "you can't afford it". Yo, I can't ignore it
Well go call them dope boys, you know you feel boring!
You know that you fiending, you know that you need it
It's Gucci, I'm greedy. My niggas stay eating2Embed
