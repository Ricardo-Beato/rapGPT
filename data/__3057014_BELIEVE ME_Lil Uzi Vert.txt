That be Maaly Raw

Niggas always say they real, how you real?
No-no, no-no, I can tell (Yeah)
You the type to run and tell (Yeah)
My niggas, they came to kill
You get close, they hit your shell (Yeah)
Boy, don't talk, stay to yourself
You know that I got the bell
You know that I got the bell, got the bell, got the bell
Forty, that's behind my belt
'Cause my chain on Michael Phelps
Diamond wet like wishing well
In the light, your chain gon' melt (Woah)
That girl said I'm famous now (Huh?)
Back then she was like, "Oh well" (Baby)

Ayy, yeah, yeah, gotta believe me
Diamonds baguettes and the diamonds so wet that I probably need to get a squeegee (Clean)
I told that girl to stop talkin' so slick
'Cause I know, man, that she gonna need me (Huh?)
Smoking that gas, drinkin' Fiji
I don't need you, just believe me (Woah, woah)
This is my world, just believe me (Believe me)
I got another girl right on the side if that girl ever just try to leave me (Bye-bye)
I got the swag and the sauce, when it come to these clothes, I'm ahead of the season (Bye-bye)
No, I do not gotta go outer space, go to New York and now I'm on Venus (High)
Woah, now I'm so high, move slow (Hey)
Fuck on your bitch and you know (You know it)
Now that boy wanna do the most (Boy)
I had to say "Adiós" (Bah, adiós), money come in envelope
I'ma keep gettin' the dough, pockets so big that they poke
