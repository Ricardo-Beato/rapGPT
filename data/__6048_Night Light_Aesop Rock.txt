65 ContributorsNight Light Lyrics
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Night Light, sucka!!!

Put one up for shackle me not clean logic procreation
I did invent the wheel, in a previous generation
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I locate modern halos and pass 'em out to the cavemen
Y'all catch a 30-second flash frame
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split fantastic!
Fathom the splicing of major-league low-life
With anti-hero earthworm mentality – Godzilla!
I pace my game for zero-hour completion
See, a cretin's still a cretin, even speakin' altered moniker
American nightmare lost in the monitor
I'll hold the door open, so you can stagger through
Then send berserker-bred Jukies in after you
It's Gutter, and I spell it with the 'G' I stole from "Get the fuck up!"
Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teeming dumb luck
Still I promise: temperance towards breed still bleeding Amish
See, the freaks sucked out the wattage
While three bears invade the cottage
And I can't sleep now! Yeah, the police'll laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when you're hosted
By the ghost of Christmas past
You won't be laughing when your blow-up doll's got a headache and won't give up the ass
I'ma lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed
So I staple-gun 'em to my feet
This origami dream is beautiful: pull the tail, watch the wings flap
But you really can't do a thing with that
You might also like
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces, spit 'em at your species
Beached in a city of lost barnacles and leeches
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
(Day turns night)
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, sucka!!!

I'm pretty sure I got a pulse
Plus we Shimmy cross the centerfold, and our night light engulfed
Just let me keep the crumbs (Please!)
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a dead-beat tryin' to make a dollar off a bomb threat
Okay, link me to activism chain, activate wild-style Pluto orbit
Set a course, then push the button
I swallow spores born by the laws
Of a morbid glutton– Alley gospel
I can spot a duck battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle (gone)
Zig-zag and zig 'em again
Before the pig can pull a badge out for the lash out
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Like, "Houston, we have a problem: they're buffing the trains the same day the graffiti writers bomb 'em!"
Who split holiday freaks on box-cut cinema high road bellow?
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow!
I'm tryin' to meet the wizard, but a tailgating tin-man holding a oil can won't let a hermit crab break in his new shell-toes
Life's not a bitch: life is a beyotch
Who keeps the villagers circling the marketplace
Out searching for the g-spot
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole – maybe I'm just an asshole!
Kiss the speaker wire (*kiss*)
Sammy Swashbuckler pagan threshhold
Stomach full of diner food, wingspan cast black upon views
Here to help release the rabid hounds or pick apart your mood
I got this friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah," and gave him one last look and smashed him
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces, spit 'em at your species
Beached in a city of lost barnacles and leeches
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, sucka!!!

Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Day turns night, day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night, day turns night4Embed
