70 ContributorsCrown the Kings Lyrics
Fuck it, crown the kings
You dig?
You know know what I mean?
Fuck it, crown the king
Benz truck for the queen
G.I.A, my rings
G.I. Joe, my team
Fuck what you mean
Fuck what you mean
Talking too cheap
Like money and green

Nigga look like we'll, nigga look like we'll shoot at 'em
Niggas look like we'll sponsor the dope and you sell 'em
Nigga look like you'd snitch on a nigga, yeah, you tell 'em
Nigga might think we UPS the way we mail 'em

Nigga might think you FED's the way you snap pictures
Shawty look like she serve the way she ride with niggas
Get what you earn when you ride with pistols
Trigger, finger, itching, itching R.I.P. to Pistol Pete
She hit that line, London Fletcher
Fish bowl, wrist swimming on the fish
Catch a Babe Ruth, the bat
I batted the bat
Two hoes attached, call them Siamese cats (Siamese twins)
I do all stunts, I kick like a football punt
You wanna talk loads? I made three mil this month
You wanna talk keys? The white with the black wrap looking like nuns
You wanna talk thieves? One side got it coming in, none
You might also like
Fuck it, crown the kings
We're living the dream
Crown the kings
Living the dream

Nigga look like we'll, nigga look like we'll shoot at 'em
Niggas look like we'll sponsor the dope and you sell 'em
Nigga look like you'd snitch on a nigga, yeah, you tell 'em
Nigga might think we UPS the way we mail 'em

Drown the ice with medicine (Medicine)
Drown your bitch with the skeleton (Drown)
I'm on the stove cooking elements (Elements)
The skies the limit, I'm heaven-sent (Sky)
Dripping the flies, a pelican (Dripping in)
Buy me a zoo, I got elephants (Zoo)
They salty, these niggas not relevant (Who?)
They copy the bros and it's evident (Copying)
Riding in the red Wraith, row your boat (Boats)
My soul devoted (Soldiers)
Bank rolls are loaded (Bank rolls, ahh)
Cash out, no notice (Hey)
Rolls Royce came with a chauffeur (Chauffeur)
Stick in the couch and the sofa (Sticks)
Five Karat in my ear, it's a boulder (Karats)
Pass me the fire, smoke 'em (Fire)
Me and my bitch are like B and Hova (Hova)
Go do a show in the 'Sota (Sota)
Stash the 100's they mowed up (Stash)
Fuck on your bitch 'til she throw up (Smash)
Stick to the code, don't fold up (Cold)
Boujee bitch, her nose up (Boujee)
Smashing the thot, do I toe-tap (Smashing up)
Hundred round drums, cold cuts
Fuck it, crown the kings
We're living the dream
Crown the kings
Living the dream

Nigga look like we'll, nigga look like we'll shoot at 'em
Niggas look like we'll sponsor the dope and you sell 'em
Nigga look like you'd snitch on a nigga, yeah, you tell 'em

I got every drug that start with a letter
Chickens is tender
With her she said I'm "like Souja Boy the way you tell em"
Breakin' and enter
Free all my nigga locked up in the cell, no cellular
I'm special, but first I was regular
Fuck the feds and free my niggas thatâ€™s federal
Couple scammers and some decimals
I'ma feed 'em to the animals
I let 'em play in the back with them lions
'Til he run out of the stamina
I told him "he stealing" he told me I'm lying
I told him I got him on camera
Act like I wanna make music with ya
Just to hit you and your manager
Fuck it, crown the kings
Crown the kings
Fuck it, crown the kings4Embed
