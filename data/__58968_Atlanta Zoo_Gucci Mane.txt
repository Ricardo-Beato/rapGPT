29 ContributorsAtlanta Zoo Lyrics
Take it, FATBOI

I'm obnoxious, I'm flowing crazy, I need to stop this
Don't knock this, you niggas lazy ya'll need to watch this
Preposterous if you can fathom how you can block this
My phantom was seen on Candler, you ride the transit
No options you niggas can't act like ya'll forgot this
I'm tired but switch ya flow up, it's so monotonous
It's my metropolis, I'll drop a 12 on ya so colossus
My swag plus my drop top yellow jag why they gossip
I'm the nigga upload your twitter, bitch I'm the topic
Profess it but Gucci didn't graduate from college
Your girlfriend says my ear rings are erotic
My lambo doors open upward they're robotic
It's Gucci

Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (gucci)
You might also like
Drop beam, off set things, color ice cream
White dreams, she can fuck me, that's a pipe dream
X-O, poppin' x-pills so exciting
My ex chick and ex homeboy uninvited
Cases of Ace of Spade, bitch getcha wasted
The waitress, I made her reload it like the Matrix
I lean laid with a bad bitch Black and Asian
On 20, headed to Buckhead, I'm racing baby
But take that fake jewelry off, that shit is fugazi
You think that you're hotter than the kid you're mistaken
Real and you niggas really really good at fakin'
So trill, I'mma keep it real, I'm back to the basics

Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (gucci)

Heads up, my partner stashin' bricks up on his roof top
Whole key, half a key, quarter key
Gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin' juke box
Pop-pop hear the Glock cock, and I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D
Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic and a shank that shape like Tennessee (ugh!)
I cut ya, I cut ya to the white meat
And my partner pushin' more crack than a bike seat
I smoke the best, I get my dro from California
Get high and go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma
But these niggas ain't got no heart not even if they had a donor
I roam the streets, so who the fuck is you?
Southside, Collipark, king of the jungle
My name is Ludacris, living in Atlanta zoo
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (gucci)7Embed
