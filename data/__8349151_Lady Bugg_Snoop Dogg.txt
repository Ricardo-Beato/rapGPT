1 ContributorLady Bugg Lyrics
A litty bitty lady of the soarin' through the sky
Searchin' for the life, so the startin' hurt to shine (Boy)
There await the big dog to help her stir her weed (Boy)
And now the world will hear again, this lady bug will sing

I'm a little lady lights (Lights)
And I'm callin', callin', callin', callin' for you
I'm a little lady love bug
I think I'm fallin', fallin', fallin' for you
I'm a little lady lights
And I'm callin', callin', callin', callin' for you
I'm a little lady love bug (Love bug)
I think I'm fallin', fallin', fallin' for you (Fallin', fallin', fallin' for you)

Little lady light, all up in the club
Was it all about love, was it all about cuz?
Four thousand lady bugs livin' in the hills
Of Japan, in the land, lady bug need a man
And I can understand why you're callin' funny
I turn away 'cause I know you're fallin' for me
And time will tell what prime will sell
Record after record, with clientele
Chill, likе he peek MD
'Cause we Sony, likе DMG
Tenderoni, you BO me
Bouncin' ball with the big boss dog
I know you're fallin' for me, baby doll
You might also like
My love come down and you take it away
My love come down and you take me away
My love come down and you give it away
My love come down and you take me away

I'll play Clyde, you can be Bonnie
Better yet, I'm Snoop Dogg, you can play Connie
Mommy right beside me
Walk that walk, now talk that talk
I double your pleasure, nothin' could measure
Pimpin' is a secret, it's my hidden treasure
Make you stop and wonder how the Dogg
Is swimmin' with the sharks in the land down under
Makin' the sound, breakin' the ground
Turn the music up more, so I can break it on down
I got fowls to play
Do it to you a hundred thousand miles away
I hate to leave but I have to, but before I go
Let me rap too, let me show my flow
I got styles to play, fowls to say
Listen to me hundred miles away (Miles)
Yeah, a hundred thousand (Miles)
Yeah, a hundred thousand (Look, miles)
Yeah, a hundred thousand (Miles)
I'm a little lady love bug (Love bug)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Little lady light
Little lady love bug
Little lady light
Ooh
Little lady light
Ooh
Little lady light
Ooh
I'm a little lady light
Little lady love bug (Love bug)
Love bug
Callin', callin', callin', callin' for you
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' for you
Callin', callin', callin', callin' for you
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' for youEmbed
