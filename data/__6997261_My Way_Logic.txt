I'ma do it my way (My way)
Ah yeah, I'ma do it my way (My way)
They lookin' at me sideways (Sideways)
But I ain't livin' for the dead today
I'ma do it my way (My way)
Ah yeah, I'ma do it my way (My way)
They lookin' at me sideways (Sideways)
But I ain't livin' for the dead today

I'm on ten, homie, yeah I'm on ten
Just me and my family and all my friends
We gon' do it our way 'til the fuckin' end
I'ma do it my way, I won't ever bend, oh yeah
Take a look in my lens
Bad bitch with me when I pull up in a Benz
That's my baby mama, ain't no drama, don't pretend

Ah yeah, if you had my money then you'd do it your way
Ah yeah, if you have my money you will do it your way, but

I'ma do it my way (My way)
Ah yeah, I'ma do it my way (My way)
They lookin' at me sideways (Sideways)
But I ain't livin' for the dead today
I'ma do it my way (My way)
Ah yeah, I'ma do it my way (My way)
They lookin' at me sideways (Sideways)
But I ain't livin' for the dead today

This for everybody at the party goin' crazy
All that bullshit don't phase me
On the dancefloor bumpin' JAY-Z
Sip a lil' somethin' then the night got hazy (Hey)

I feel bad for anybody that stayed in
Oh yeah, fuck whoever hatin'
Drinks on me, I'm payin'

Ah yeah, if you had my money then you'd do it your way
Ah yeah, if you have my money you will do it your way but

I'ma do it my way (My way)
Ah yeah, I'ma do it my way (My way)
They lookin' at me sideways (Sideways)
But I ain't livin' for the dead today
I'ma do it my way (My way)
Ah yeah, I'ma do it my way (My way)
They lookin' at me sideways (Sideways)
