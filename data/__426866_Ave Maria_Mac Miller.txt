101 ContributorsAve Maria Lyrics
Yeah
And I can't feel my legs, I'm a paraplegic
Lord, I want a fair one with my demons
Karen Meyers became married to Jesus
Born dead, they had to dig up my fetus
And now the devil want to tear me to pieces
I'm a diagnosed insomniac
An astronaut who blastin' off into the star galactic
On top of Saturn, fox-trottin' with velociraptors
The dino-aliens invaded Earth, so they could feed on hypochondriacs
Prepared for the rapture, closet hillbilly
Threw the spinners on the tractor, I listen to Uncle Kracker, but
That's white America for you, we all that matters
I'm walkin' backwards, shadowboxin' with karate masters
It's more to rap, we sell the royal crack at Castle Rock
A bad apple like an unemployed Macintosh
We lost Jobs, now they brainwashed with dot com
It's only so long until we surrender the free world to Hong Kong
And sinners stay still, but the merry go round
And round
It all just keeps spinnin'
Gotta keep swimmin' (Keep swimmin'), yeah (Keep swimmin')
Eat, drink and let the merry go round
Eat, drink and let the merry go round
Eat, drink and let the merry go round
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Yeah, yeah)

I got a double-sided silver dollar
Larry Fish here from midget league, beginner slaughter
I'm not drownin', I'm wadin' in the water
Killin' off these monsters ever since I was a Sabra
I got horses on my PJ's
Shout to Spitta, jet life, I fit the Porsches on the PJ's
On stage, sendin' dark forces to my DJ
The birdies on tour like PGA, Davis Love III
Pittsburgh warrior, bullets in my cornea
In exelsis Deo, ayo, this is Gloria
(Ave) Av—(Maria)—Ave Maria
I'm gettin' bread, yeast rise on Easter, money is God (God)
Black bitches with jungle fever, I love to be on
You on the B-Team, I fuck with Solange
All my life they said I doesn't belong
So I'm chillin', growin' drugs on my lawn

Sinners stay still, but the merry go round
And round
It all just keeps spinnin'
Gotta keep swimmin' (Keep swimmin'), yeah (Keep swimmin')
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go round)
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go round)
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go round)
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go r—)
Yeah
What? What? What?
Have you found a way out?
Have you found a way out? Yeah
A vacation in Slovakia, celebratin' Mardi Gras
Eatin' baklava and lobster claw at the Ramada
With a Mafia of immigrants
Finna take 'em on a pilgrimage
Have you found a way out?25Embed
