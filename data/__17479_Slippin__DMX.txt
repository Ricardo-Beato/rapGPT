It's what it is baby
It's straight biz baby
We ain't kids baby
We get down like that

Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

(Check it), more money more problems
I thought more money would solve 'em
I spent more money in Harlem
Than Frank Lucas did before the boys got 'em
Now the shit done changed
How I'm feelin'? the shit look strange
I realize that shit ain't the same
'Cause at the end of the day this shit ain't a game
Nigga goin' through it but I slipped and fell
Ran to the hood, took a trip to Hell
Deal when I should, that's why all my shit sell
Always know I could, so I did well
You might also like
Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

If y'all only knew
What my life was like, and what I'm goin' through
Maybe you'd think before you talk (okay?!)
You better crawl before you walk (come on!)
You think havin' money is the answer?
Money ain't nothin' but another form of cancer
All you could do is watch me die
You don't wanna watch me cry, so watch me fly!
What you gon' do is watch me fly
Do my thing on that big stage in the sky
Lord, please, hold me down
'Cause now everybody wanna know me now

Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'
Please help me, which way do I go?
Life's a book, which page do I show?
'Cause I know, can't show 'em all
Even though I slipped and fell I won't fall
Get it? Okay, you don't
Some of y'all will but most of y'all won't
I'mma keep livin' life bein' the man
That God made me 'cause I know only He can save me

Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

(Shouting)
I wish, I wish, ah I wish you knew!
I wish you fucking knew!
(Singing)
*humming* maAHmmaAHH
You love me
I don't wanna fall
I won't fall
I don't wanna fall
Please help me
I don't wanna fall
