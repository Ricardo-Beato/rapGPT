1 ContributorBehind the Ropes Lyrics
I flow like breakfast when I spit
So all you need is bacon and eggs, cause I take it back to the grit
They ask why I never signed to the Roc
But if Jay is my man, then what's the difference son we both signed to the block
Niggas is jumpin' around like House of Pain
But be humpin' the ground as soon as I  with the pump and the pound
Fuck jail, what I'm  for
Don't play wit your kids either
That's what you got Nas for
Y'all can't be serious, button your zippers
It's a two team town, yeah, but y'all niggas 
Come off at the clothes like strippers
With a flow so relaxed that all you need now is a pillow or slippers
That enough? Cause anything after us is garunteed to do only one thing shorty, fuck it up

What up Sauce Money? Long time no fear
You know the industry is scared whenever we appear
Although all alone, I'll admit, I'm a haunted home
Strike like lightnin' nigga it's quite frigtenin'
Don't be afraid I won't pop at your 
They still got me on probation so I got to behave
You ain't got to be gay, be a man
Peter Pan, take a piss when you stand
When you sit, take a shit
See I don't just body things up
I potty train fucks, I got your game up
The GM of the ballers
With 3 of them in the BM around 3 am in the mornin
 to get it started like Pink and them
I got em thinkin I'm fallin, I'm winkin and I'm steady doggin' em
