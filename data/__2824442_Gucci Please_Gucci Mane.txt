Huh
Mwah, burr

Gucci, please, tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze? (Huh?)
Tell me that you love me, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, please (Gucci, Gucci)
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze? (Huh?)
Tell me that you love me, tell me, tell me, Gucci, please (Please)

Baby, freeze, I know a nigga look like nine-hundred keys (Huh?)
Baby say my ring look like a hundred Ps (Woo)
I got college bitches fallin' out, calm down, breathe (Uh, uh, uh)
If y'all keep runnin' on the stage, then I'ma have to leave
I'm 'bout to drop the top, so I can feel the summer breeze (Huh)
It's a cold blooded motherfuckin' Rollie on my sleeve (Burr)
It feels like I'm the freshest nigga out, or is it me? (Me, is it me?)
He gettin' a lil' money but that nigga isn't me (Uh)
G-U-C-C-Icy, I'm the one girls wanna see (It's Gucci)
G-U-W-O-P, I'm the one boys wanna be (Woah)
Lil' mama got her hair fixed, is her's or it weave (Yeah)
Shit, I don't give a damn, just know that you look like a queen
You might also like
Gucci, please, tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze? (Huh?)
Tell me that you love me, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, please (Gucci, Gucci)
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze? (Huh?)
Tell me that you love me, tell me, tell me, Gucci, please (Please)
Gucci, please, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, please (Gucci, Gucci, Gucci)
Gucci, please, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, please (Gucci)
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze? (Huh?)
Tell me that you love me, tell me, tell me, Gucci, please

Can we pretend that I'm your man and that makes you my girlfriend?
And have an one night stand in my brand new Benz (Huh?)
And we ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody peepin' in
The windows tinted black, it ain't no lookin' in
Bitches talking 'bout my house, I think they tryna climb the fence (Woah)
They say that when my dick come out, that it's a big event (Hm?)
Pool in a backyard, do you like to swim?
'Cause I'ma work you out and I'm not talkin' 'bout the gym (Yeah)
Gucci just got out but, God damn, he goin' in (Huh?)
These lil' boys don't ball like Guwop, he play above the rim (No)
Women on my page comin' like, "Damn, he gettin' slim" (Yeah)
Caucasian women see me, be like, "Is it really him?" (Damn)

Gucci, please, tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze? (Woah, huh?)
Tell me that you love me, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, please (Gucci, Gucci)
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze? (Huh?)
Tell me that you love me, tell me, tell me, Gucci, please (Please)
Gucci, please, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, please (Gucci, Gucci, Gucci)
Gucci, please, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, please (Gucci)
Tell me that you love me, can I be your main squeeze? (Huh?)
Tell me that you love me, tell me, tell me, Gucci, please4Embed
