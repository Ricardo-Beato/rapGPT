4 ContributorsEve of Destruction LyricsThe eastern world, it is explodin'
Violence flarin' and bullets loadin'
You're old enough to kill, but not for votin'
And that Jordan River has bodies floatin'
But you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction
Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feelin' today?
If the button is pushed there's no runnin' away
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave
Take a look around ya boy, it's bound to scare ya boy
But you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction
My blood's so mad, it feels like coagulatin'
I'm sitting here just contemplatin'
You can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation
And a handful of senators can't pass legislation
And marches alone can't bring integration
When human respect is disintegratin'
Now this whole crazy world is just too frustratin'
You might also likeBut you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction

People I hate, that's understood
It will make stuff hard to under
Was feeling blooded to human race
If you win your war it's the same old place
The poundin' drums, the pride and disgrace
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door neighbor, but don't forget to say grace
But tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of
But tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction
Yeah, you don't believe
We're on the eve of destructionEmbed
