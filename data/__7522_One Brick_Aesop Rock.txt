30 ContributorsOne Brick Lyrics
I start my city with a brick (one brick)
Then add another brick (two bricks)
Brick by brick I manufacture homes for fallen angels
I ain't no great Samaritan, that's just the way the game goes
Respect the polars but acknowledge middle-value rainbows
My snout turned up from dream factory eyelids
Slinging bottled prosperity for the kamikaze colonels
Yeah rocks the match that burned his Nazi journals
And plotting verticals amidst blatantly horizontal
Models then swallowed by famished potholes
And I'm tired, tied up on these functions
Killer cotton candy clouds and huckleberry justice league
Another knuckle dragger dungeon breed
Run, breathe, sit, bellow
Wild Aes scream through your style to hear the echo
Aight then, flinch for the great granddaddy payback
When Little Billy bought a tugboat
Now he thinks he's Captain Ahab
Fascist, it takes more than peg legs, birds and eye patches
Learn that lesson you'll be swashbuckling with the best of them
Wonder why you wept over spilled milk and got your crayons wet
The room reeks of a thousand bayonets
I'll fission vision with a lie longer than your most walked meridian
Connecting life with that little species of idiots
We've now officially scraped barrel bottom
Aesop Rock, an apple to the core but y'all ignored him
I know a planet made of porcelain
And once I get tired of holding this gavel up
Y'all prayer circles met him up born again
I ain't too good for tap water
Play taps out of order for a ballad, corpse a dead man walking
You can lead a man to a city, but that don't assure civility
You can beat a man to death with Aesop Rock bootleg CD's (That's more fun anyway)
Some cats float, some cats don't
I speak in Fahrenheit and burn off coal and lyric
Diss blatant harassment, spit honor, whistle fearless
Don't dismiss the billy goat appearance for that common sheep

Platforms have been erected
Effigies built
Slogans coined, songs have been written
Rumors have been circulated
Autographs faked
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
Moving boxes have been worn out
Mantelpieces dusted
Idols idolized, the sands have been shifted
Curtains have been closed
Sleepers all waked
The hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape

Now with my trusty paperclip
I pick locks of thoughts vault
Finding the garden barren
The harvest fruitless
Only the tree of life flourishing
Wanting to take a bite but I'm toothless
Is that predestination or is it by design?
That I'm trapped in time sand
Show radio mission control but for my rhymes
Man because I can like aluminium
And I recycle my consciousness
This is just a note
For any action or lack thereof there's a consequence
Wingless angels
Stroll a top shapeless cotton balls
With halos in your syringe
Celestial ground is found, broken
Exposing a bottomless depth where heartless spines awake to devour the small piece of your soul that's left
You're immersed in sound, floating
Aimless destination
Drop anchor to gain stability
Stare out potions, restrain fertility
Pedestal talk is a token soaked in pockets where lives' topics lack conceptual, ridicule
The night breathes, but light's choking
Darkness occupies the throne where poems are persecuted
The purity at time diluted
Rhymes are executed for genre, I'm told
When has beens attempt to cause heat to rise and wonder why they're trapped in cold
Life's an origami box and I'm hidden within the fold
So when the yarn unravels I won't be caught by surprise
And as society's fabric of orthodoxies dismantle I'll see you embracing the pentagram within this crucifix disguise
See, when the canvas stands before me I'm compelled to spill a vision
For the sinners that listen: I got three spikes and a thorn crown
It seems I need a new soul because mine is worn down
But from the pregnancy of my hardship was born style
Still my pen bleeds and stains the paper with thought
Finding me lost among statues of mainstream idols
Drowning in melted ice, to reinforce that breath is vital
If your father and his father were fish out of water you must break the cycle
How many times must a plant be uprooted, for it to die?
When it's smothered with lies that abolish the potency of the sky
So when the stars burn out and God replaces the bulbs with a million watts
And throws the switch, sparks filament
Herding blue giants and flocks
I stand on my own two, aura illuminated in red
Showcasing the agony held within this welded spirit
Sacrificing itself for the health of a masochistic culture
Yearning for the truth that we speak, but refuse to hear it
