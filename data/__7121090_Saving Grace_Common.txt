3 ContributorsSaving Grace Lyrics
Behind my eyes, I reach for skies that tell no lies
The earth, it cries for change that can't be televised
We polarized and synthesized by stimuli
My heart is why the parts all died, I can't deny
I realize your eternal eyes see through my disguise
These falls, what do they symbolize?
I know that you made me to rise
I need pain to feel alive when racism still alive
I was told that life's a bitch, hope that she don't kill my vibe
I've been still, but still, I rise
Lots of things I feel inside
Took some shots to still advise
Your grace and will are still alive
I can read again, believin' in the deeds amend
Your likeness, we created it, it's where we begin
Yeah, into theâ€”

In your grace, I made peace
You've got will, I've got power
In your grace, I made peace
You've got will, I've got power
In your grace, I made peace
You've got will, I've got power
In your grace, I made peace
You've got will, I've got power

Some days, I don't have the energy
Holding back the pain of my ancestry
Trying to break the patterns of our history
Changing the direction of my family tree
I worked so hard, they're so proud of me (Ha)
I don't have no time to be visiting
I'm running through my life, and what'd I get to be?
Thirty-three with something to give to my offspring
My mom and dad tried to teach their love to me
There's some days I forget that I am lovely
That God is over me and not above me
And I know He still loves me

In your grace, I made peace
You've got will, I've got power
In your grace, I made peace
You've got will, I've got power
In your grace, I made peace
You've got will, I've got power
In your grace, I made peace
You've got will, I've got power

In your, into your grace
Grace, graceEmbed
