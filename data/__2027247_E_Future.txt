10 ContributorsE Lyrics
I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
I'm back on E
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
I'm back on E
And I ain't even a shooter, nigga
I'm so geeked up, I want to shoot the nigga
I'm back on E
I done throwed back a double
In the club, fucking bitches, me and Trouble
I'm back on E

I'm back on E
White naked ladies
While my pockets on E
It's fuck you, pay me
Somebody save me
Or should I say save this nigga
Cause when my pockets on E
They all looking like victims
Ready to flip your temple
Got niggas in  Who stay rolling on E, living similar to me
Hey Future, I can only warn 'em (Do you wanna play?)
I pop a transformer, transform ya (Do you wanna lay?)
Put your legs up where your head's supposed to be 
So just let a nigga get cash (I'm talking ¡ándale!) (Guap!)
Linked up with tape, put the money in the front
Just pass a blunt and let me go slow
Before I pop three more
You might also like
I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
I'm back on E
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
I'm back on E
And I ain't even a shooter, nigga
I'm so geeked up, I want to shoot the nigga
I'm back on E
I done throwed back a double
In the club, fucking bitches, me and Trouble
I'm back on E

My heater to capacity
My pockets full of capacity
I'm feeling like your majesty
And I cause a catastrophe 
I'm Houston classified flying around ya
While them bullets flying around you
I was in Montego, when they found you
Got more ice than a water fountain
And I'm rolling baby, with a Nike sign and two naked ladies
Can't help but floss, nigga, I'm a codeine boss, nigga
On good drank, with a full tank, and a big bank (skrrrrt)
I'm so in the paint, I cut you up with a shank 
I'm throw up fingers, whenever I talk to you
And I'm so geeked up right now, I can't even talk to you (Pluto!)
You featherweight, I'm like a hawk on you (Freebandz!)
Send her to my section, I'm gonna spread some sauce on you
I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
I'm back on E
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
I'm back on E
And I ain't even a shooter, nigga
I'm so geeked up, I want to shoot the nigga
I'm back on E
I done throwed back a double
In the club, fucking bitches, me and Trouble
I'm back on E

I'm on all type of drugs, I'm draped up with the thugs
And I don't conversate, cause I converse back with the plug
We handle good business, We smoke good loud
We swap out bad bitches, cause ain't none of them ours
I'm trouble trouble, baby, Geeked up, looking sour
 Way too many hours
Pass me the Aquafina, Can't do nothing with a single
I done popped so many pills, you can't know how I feel

I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
I'm back on E
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
I'm back on E
And I ain't even a shooter, nigga
I'm so geeked up, I want to shoot the nigga
I'm back on E
I done throwed back a double
In the club, fucking bitches, me and Trouble
I'm back on E1Embed
