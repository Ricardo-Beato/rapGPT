Just wanna let you in 'cause I know you got good taste, and

Don't you play with it, get naughty
Call you daddy, you call me mami
You so crazy when you're talking (Yeah)
And I say, yeah, talk like that
All up in my ear when he want that wax
Funny how the earrings are all intact
Can't even hear when I moan like that
Aw yeah, that's your fault
With a lil' serious tone in fact
Grab my hair with the eye contact
Phone sex good, that's why I phone back, uh
And you know that I pick up right when you call me
Got your voice in my head, it's making me horny
And I can't help but wake you up in the morning
You know most of the day I'm gonna be lonely
