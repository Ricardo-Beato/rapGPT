This is 50

I, don't know what you take me for
I, really don't play that shit
I, ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit

I got a itchy-itchy trigger finger, nigga it's killin' me
Not to spray this shit
I got enough ammo shots blow I put a hole
In any motherfucker out this bitch
I unload to reload when you get hit I suppose
You gon' be strong enough to take this shit
I'm in the hood ridin' 'round with a chrome four pound
Can you see through the limousine tints?
I do dirt, the gat bust, I get to kickin' up dust
'fore the Jakes come around here kid
Niggas get knocked if D's start askin' question
My name end up in all types of shit
I'll be a gangsta nigga 'til I die fo' sho'
Whether I'm po' or I'm filthy rich
Now what you know about movin' that Peruvian flake
For that cake, I get rid of dem bricks
You might also like
I, don't know what you take me for
I, really don't play that shit
I, ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit
I, don't know what you take me for
I, really don't play that shit
I, ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit

Now I gotta have shoes, you know chrome 22's
Every time I get a brand new whip
I rode around in the 5 'til my money got right
Then I went back and got that six
I'm in a big white Benz on a hot sunny day
I call it the milk truck and shit
I'll have your ho eyeballin' at the light, damn pimpin'
You should take time to check that bitch
Find me ridin' through the hood actin' like it's all good
But I'm looking for a jux and shit
In the middle of the night, you can turn on the light
Find me and my niggas in yo' crib
Nigga holla if there's a problem and yo' niggas got drama
I got burners for sale and shit
Got them MAC's, got them 9's, got them techs full of dime
Hollow-tips and them extra clips
I, don't know what you take me for
I, really don't play that shit
I, ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit
I, don't know what you take me for
I, really don't play that shit
I, ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit

Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
E'rything about me be gangsta
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
I won't hesitate to pop or shank ya
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
They can't hustle when I'm in this shit
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
You don't listen, you gon' get yo' ass hit

Yeah, nigga cherish me
Like the water you drink
Like the air you breathe
You need me to live
