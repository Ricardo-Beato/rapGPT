Hah, hah

Gucci back home with the bling on
And if you think I ain't strapped then you think wrong
I ain't goin' back and forth, this ain't ping pong
Get your leg torn off, whole head blown
I was selling bales before I sold a ringtone
The whole hood know my number like Mike Jones
Yellowbone and she dancing in a pink thong
She ask me can we make love with my mink on
I call my migo plug, now, nigga, pack gone
Trapped a trailer full of strong, this my backbone
I used to sell half a ounces out a trailer home
I seen friends turn to foes 'cause the paper gone

I had to cut lil mama off, now we back on
They think I'm still selling soft like it's back on
I was gone for a minute, now it's back on
I'm self made and independent, yup, black owned
I had to cut lil mama off, now we back on
They think I'm still selling soft like it's back on
I was gone for a minute, now it's back on
I'm self made and independent, yup, we black owned

Gucci Mane a menace (menace back on)
A hundred grand spent at the dentist (huh)
Hold up, I'm not even finished (wow)
I'm the realest nigga living (yea)
I'm the best that ever did it (true)
Here's a message to my critics (fuck you)
Fuck your bitch, go get some business (go)
I just bought my bitch a Bentley (skrrt)
Hold up, I'm lyin' I bought my bitch a business (yea)
My wife say she worth twenty millis
We drive a Lambo through the city (yoom)
I think I'm Rambo with the semi

I had to cut lil mama off, now we back on
They think I'm still selling soft like it's back on
I was gone for a minute, now it's back on
I'm self made and independent, yup, black owned
I had to cut lil mama off, now we back on
They think I'm still selling soft like it's back on
I was gone for a minute, now it's back on
I'm self made and independent, yup, we black owned

Now we back on
Like it's back home
Now it's back on
Yup, black owned2Embed
