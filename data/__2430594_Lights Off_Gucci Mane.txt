6 ContributorsLights Off Lyrics
I suggest you don’t try me
Last thing you gonna expect me
Is hangin’ in the motherfuckin’ tree
With a sniper rifle, smokin’ on weed
Me and juice used to trap on front street
Aw fuck, damn, there go dc
Dekalb county they be riding too deep
Bet them crackers can’t catch me on feet
Pussy you ain’t from no Sunvalley (Valley)
You ain’t bought no weed from old man Lee
You was servin’ 50s and sadies, and I serve a baby and a QP

A nigga trend to steal my car (what the fuck)
Somebody tried to break in my house (pussy nigga)
I can’t let ya run off with a ounce, (What the fuck)
Cause thats like takin’ food out my mouth (pussy nigga)
I’mma have to turn ya lights off, I’mma have to turn ya lights off
Money talk and bullshit walk, so I’mma lay your ass in chalk

A bitch said gucci can’t speak, he stuck up the nigga so cheap
I said baby girl the dick ain't free
You can try hard but you can’t break me
Remember that bitch tried to double cross me
I tried to flip the nigga SUV
Nigga we can shoot it out like G’s, (what)
He start begging’ pleadin’ gucci mane please
This bitch called me said she need 10 G’s
I told her palm voice Babygirl freeze
I can’t shit off the stuff that she eat
So why help when I can help me
Its Gucci!

I’mma have to turn ya lights off, I’mma have to turn ya lights off
Money talk and bullshit walk, so I’mma lay your ass in chalkEmbed
