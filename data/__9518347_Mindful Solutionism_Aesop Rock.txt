34 ContributorsMindful Solutionism Lyrics
2.5 million years ago, a friend of mine
Made a tool from a stone and defended his tribe
It's technology, sorry for the technical term
It's a wheel then a fire and the rest is a blur
Throw a theorized plot in the pot with applied science
Let it sit, I bet it streamlines your environs, yeah
What's a resource local to the grotto?
The method isn't free until the mechanism follow
That's technology, innovate a difference
A feat of engineering, a system made efficient
There isn't a condition, complication, or a vision
Where the answer ain't to build a more sophisticated widget, idgit
Tired of games, Bronze Age, Iron Age
Weaponry in stellar form, shelter finer by the day
Livestock and vegetables in rows behind the hideaway
Mesopotamia out the motherfuckin' lion cage, yuh

If it's out of the bag then it's out of the bag
If it's out of the bag then it's out of the bag
If it's out of the bag then it's out of the bag
Now that is a powerful cat
Now that is a powerful cat
Now that is a powerful cat
You might also like
You take a lever and a pulley and a winch and a wedge
You get a labyrinth of aqueducts and pyramid steps
Before the Jesus, Archimedes on that miracle tech
Year Zero, you could feel the future rearing its head
Put a shoe on a horse, shoot a man with a gun
Steam power, bifocals, and mechanical funk
Manipulate electricity, no, it cannot be done
Yes it can, ain't a dam that can cancel the flood
True to human curiosity, at the Tree of Knowledge
Pulling genies out of bottles, stealing from Leonardos
Plain train auto hauling space age cargo
Bizzaro technology, every day is tomorrow
Telegraph, telephone, you can flirt with Doris
In Poughkeepsie from a cozy geodesic dome in Sydney
You can write a letter with no paper
You can fix anything with a laser

If it's out of the bag then it's out of the bag
If it's out of the bag then it's out of the bag
If it's out of the bag then it's out of the bag
Now that is a powerful cat
Now that is a powerful cat
Now that is a powerful cat
You could get a robot limb for your blown-off limb
Later on the same technology could automate your gig, as awesome as it is
Wait, it gets awful: you could split a atom willy-nilly
If it's energy that can be used for killing, then it will be
It's not about a better knife, it's chemistry and genocide
And medicine for tempering the heck in a projector light
Landmines, Agent Orange, leaded gas, cigarettes
Cameras in your favorite corners, plastic in the wilderness
We can not be trusted with the stuff that we come up with
The machinery could eat us, we just really love our buttons, um
Technology, focus on the other shit
3D-printed body parts, dehydrated onion dip
You can buy a Jet Ski from a cell phone on a jumbo jet
T-E-C-H-N-O-L-O-G-Y, it's the ultimate

Altitude, climate, geography, medical research, automated teaching, distribution, better health, unknown factors

If it's out of the bag then it's out of the bag
If it's out of the bag then it's out of the bag
If it's out of the bag then it's out of the bag
Now that is a powerful cat
Now that is a powerful cat
Now that is a powerful catEmbed
