I'm sick of all the rah-rah-rah
I'm not finna slide if your block hot
Big rock band, he's a shooter
Heard him talkin' about the hacks, no computer, yeah
Eat a drumstick, yeah
Top dawg, but my bitch still eat Top Ramen, yeah
Met my mom, my mom said she a top woman, yeah
I got fame and she help me keep my conscious, yeah
I don't sneak around, if I do, I have fun, huh
If they cancel me, then I retire, get the drum, yeah
If they cancel me, then I might have to pop the trunk, yeah
If they cancel me, I black on black my Air Force Ones, yeah
Let's go

Tired of rah-rah-rah
Serve a look, bitch face like raw, raw, raw
Say he quit the double cup, that's raw, raw, raw
Hit your ho, I'm finna nut, say bye, bye, bye

Leave a nigga stranded
I'm a fuck nigga (Yeah, yeah)
I'm a fuckin' bandit (Yeah)
On my momma Janice (Okay)
Eatin' Church's Chicken (Chicken)
All I eat is chicken (Yeah)
Beat the box like (Let's go)
Beat the box like (Let's go), yeah
Whole Foods on my neck, fuckin' up
Pink clothes to my neck, fuckin' up
My bitch messy, yeah, my neck, fuckin' up
I get bands, you pay respect, fuckin' up
Check, check, check, check, check please
Check one, two, get your bitch off me
Your bitch on TV if my sex tape leak
Your bitch on DVD, she won an ESPY
You might also like
Tired of rah-rah-rah
Serve a look, bitch face like raw, raw, raw
Say he quit the double cup, that's raw, raw, raw
Hit your ho, I'm finna nut, say bye, bye, bye3Embed
