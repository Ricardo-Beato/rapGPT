7 ContributorsMoney Stacks Lyrics
I got money stacked
Like dirty clothes
I love the kids
But I don't love the hoes
Fuck wit ya, boi
Shop wit ya folks
She say she love me
But she just love rolls
I got money stacks
Like dirty clothes
And I don't love her
She love my dirty dros
And if the game slow up
I'm back to flipping  O's
And I got bricks of blow
And sixty pounds of dope

R.I.P to my old hoes, say hello to my new friends
Bad chick with the red bottoms, we pull up in a brand new Benz
Foolish whip like Shawty Lo
I got foolish money, little shorty knows
My money growing like a Chia pet, our first date Lenox Mall
Our second date was shrimp & steak, our third date was hella great
Hella money, I sell hella weight
I got a big estate, with a huge lake
Helicopter with a pilot, Maybach with a driver
Bedroom with a kitchen in it, might wake up and cook a nine up
Or a deuce up for a four way
Got short money, it's no play
Got fifty pounds off that gas pack
You can smell this shit from the driveway
Sold this shit in like two days, been waiting on it like nine days
I'm a trap nigga, street living legend
Get my grass cut by like nine jays
You might also like
I got money stacked
Like dirty clothes
I love the kids
But I don't love the hoes
Fuck wit ya, boi
Shop wit ya folks
She say she love me
But she just love rolls
I got money stacks
Like dirty clothes
And I don't love her
She love my dirty dros
And if the game slow up
I'm back to flipping  O's
And I got bricks of blow
And sixty pounds of dope

Well I came up from a fifty slab
I'm bad with English but good with math
I went from Texaco trying to catch a trap
To Manhattan trying to catch a cab (what)
Well they lock me up and they let me go
I'm balling on ya like Plaxico (hah)
Got jelly beans, got collard greens, got all good kinds of vegetables
I'm highly paid and successful
Imma cook it up and get extras
Got a bank-roll, no pressure
If ya owe me I won't stress ya
Professor teaching lectures
Better pull up this semester
Might learn something if you listen to me
If ya knew better do better
I'm a go-getter, I'm a gorilla
She ain't do nothin' if I ain't let her
I ain't finished living, you penny pinchin'
I'm talking to my investors
I'm walking round, I'm talking loud
I'm smoking loud, got cheddar
Your side of town, my side of town
My birds fly any weather
I got money stacked
Like dirty clothes
I love the kids
But I don't love the hoes
Fuck wit ya, boi
Shop wit ya folks
She say she love me
But she just love rolls
I got money stacks
Like dirty clothes
And I don't love her
She love my dirty dros
And if the game slow up
I'm back to flipping  O's
And I got bricks of blow
And sixty pounds of dopeEmbed
