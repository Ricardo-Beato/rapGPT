20 ContributorsThe Life Lyrics
You ain't real if you ain't took nothin'
One time, my niggas off in Brooklyn
Shout my niggas in California
Where your enemies, they be on ya
One time for Atlanta
Nigga make million off his Country Grammar
In Detroit, they don't think twice
Thousand pounds, hundred bricks, yea that good life

Chillin' with G Armani, speakin' Italiani
Spend my 30 stacks in a weekend down in Milano, yeaah
Yea, we party with mamacitas
We don’t wear them Rollies
Lost em' rose gold, yellow, yeaaah
Damn it's about to be a scene tonight
When we pull up in them things, tonight
Yellow golden diamond rings, tonight
We're livin that good life (Yea!)
Livin' that good life
Livin' that good life (ayyyy)
Livin' that good life (yeeeaaaa)
Introduce you to that good life

Spent a rack on the belt, sip by myself
Stay away from suckers 'cause they bad for my health
Blew a kilo in Cavalli, oh I think I need some help
These niggas screamin' rich, I'm just trying to chase some wealth
.40 cal Glock edition, I tote it myself
Niggas get to bangin', I will bang this bitch myself
What'chu know about them 2-door shifts wit no tops
Jordan sandals on, might drive it with no socks
What the fuck you expect? A nigga used to sell rocks
Hit the interstate in a rental wit them blocks
Talkin' push button start, no need for keys
We ain't like them other niggas, baby we's is G's
Yea that good life
You might also like
Chillin' with G Armani, speakin' Italiani
Spend my 30 stacks in a weekend down in Milano, yeaah
Yea, we party with mamacitas
We don’t wear them Rollies
Lost em' rose gold, yellow, yeaaah
Damn it's about to be a scene tonight
When we pull up in them things, tonight
Yellow golden diamond rings, tonight
We're livin that good life (Yea!)
Livin' that good life
Livin' that good life (ayyyy)
Livin' that good life (yeeeaaaa)
Introduce you to that good life

You know you livin' when you livin' bout 40 floors up
Valet get ya car, they gotta lift them doors up
Straight to the penthouse, tear them whores up
Next time them hoes with you, tell them bitches I say "What's up?"
Got me a taste of that success and I can't get enough
Mix the haters with the fakers, that shit could be rough
Real talk, fuck em, 'member mom couldn't pay her bills
No gas in the winter gave me the chills
Posted in the projects smokin' reefer (Now what we doin?)
Now a days niggas two tone Cohibas
Dom P for the pain
Po' up a shot of Avion for the game
Chillin' with G Armani, speakin' Italiani
Spend my 30 stacks in a weekend down in Milano, yeaah
Yea, we party with mamacitas
We don’t wear them Rollies
Lost em' rose gold, yellow, yeaaah
Damn, it's about to be a scene, tonight
When we pull up in them things tonight
Yellow golden diamond rings, tonight
We're livin' that good life (Yea!)
Livin' that good life
Livin' that good life (ayyyy)
Livin' that good life (yeeeaaaa)
Introduce you to that good life

From Atlanta all the way to Milan
My niggas live a good life forever
We are across the world
(You know how we do when them niggas fall)
From Atlanta all the way to Milan
My bitches live a good life forever
We are across the world
(You know how we do when them niggas fall)
From Atlanta all the way to Milan
My niggas live a good life forever
We are across the world
(Across the world)
From Atlanta all the way to Milan
My bitches live a good life forever
We are across the world
