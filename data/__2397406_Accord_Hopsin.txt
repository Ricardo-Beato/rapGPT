Man, fuck these niggas, punk G niggas
Things get rowdy, I'ma crush these niggas
Fuck these niggas, punk G niggas
Worse comes to worse, I'll bust these niggas
I'll keep my crew with you if you keep your crew with me
Nigga you know, I'll keep my cool with you if you keep your cool with me, hey

Fuck bein' a nice dude, niggas rather see me fail, in this world to make it to make it like my teachers in High School
Never had no problems in life 'til I came with that real shit when a nigga hopped on the mic
Won't stop 'till my pockets is right
I'm tryna stack that d-o-e to the top of the sky
Niggas wanna give Hopsin the eye, put down the Glock and the knife, I'll show you how I get it poppin' tonight
I'm ready to hit nerves, I reckon you'll get served, then death is where you'll be headed like Nick Burp
My sick words'll make a nigga shit turds
Been a hard-headed brother since birth
I'm steamed up, I pinch my knuckles so hard my fist bursts
Ain't nothin' to say, I'm just cursed
Make sure you wanna lurk if you rap whatever the kid verses
Push buttons too hard, you'll get hurt, it gets worse


I'm bein' real, what you want, dog?
I'm an ill nigga, you could say I'm from the junkyard
I come from the blocks where the pumps are
Easy access, you could get dumped on
You might also like
The good die young so I'm livin' as a bad kid, it's the black kid, I make you sick of this madness
I'll be rippin' this rap shit
Soon as niggas caught my diss, they interest to go and stick in my blacks quick
You think you tight 'cause the shit you bust?
I don't give a fuck, I'ma leave you wish you was
I made you, you fake dudes, the fuck, like it ain't true
You niggas wanna play me, I fade you
I pay dues and I ain't have to follow the rules to learn music, straight go to college like you
I'm sick with it, homie, the tracks gotta stay crazy, I did the shit on my own like potty trained babies
Done looked niggas up too, and only thing I got back was a finger that said fuck you
Now who wants some of the action?
Niggas don't wanna get at me, fuck around and run up on 'em with matches
