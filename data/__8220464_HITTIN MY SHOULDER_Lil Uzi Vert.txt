Boys hating, like, "Here we go again"
Like, "Here we go again"
Like, "Here we go again"
Damn, these boys hating, like, "Here we go again"
Like, "Here we go again"
Like, "Here we go again" (Dun Deal on the track!)
Yeah, yeah

Here we go again (Yeah)
That boy stole my style (What?), stole my flow again (Yeah, yeah)
Damn, these boys hating (What?)
Like, "Hеre we go again" (Herе we—, yeah)
Got played by a five, pulled up with a ten, yeah (Yeah)
Hold up, like, "Hold up, my pockets, they swoller"
Fuckin' yo' bitch and I'm hittin' my shoulder (Woah, woo)
Whip the pot, now add the soda
This a Lamb', how dare you say Lotus? (Woah)
Fuck that bitch all the way from night to the mornin'
And she got work, in her hair, she got rollers (Yeah)
Money got longer, my diamonds got colder (Yeah)
Niggas be snakes like they are king cobra, mm-hm (Yeah)
Niggas ain't tough, they act like they soldiers, mm-hm (Yeah)
Movin' alone, I'm a VLONE soldier

Hold up, like, "Hold up, my pockets, they swoller"
Fuckin' yo' bitch and I'm hittin' my shoulder
Hold up, like, "Hold up, my pockets, they swoller"

Ain't 'bout money, don't say shit to me (No)
That's that money talk (Yeah)
Hunnid thousand for my tab, I said, "Run it, dawg" (Yeah, damn)
She ain't wanna listen to me, had to cut her off (Yeah)
Did I stutter? (Huh? Yeah, woah) Did I stutter? Nah (No)

Day time, I still see stars, yeah (Woah)
Pull up, the Wraith don't park, yeah (Mm)
Watch how I release them doors, yeah
Had to release this whore (Ooh), yeah
Had to relieve some stress (Ooh), yeah
Count it up, get me strong, yeah
Count it up when I'm bored, yeah
Flip that girl like skateboard, yeah
You already got what's mine, yeah
Now I want what's yours, yeah
At your neck like bow tie, yeah, made it all mine
