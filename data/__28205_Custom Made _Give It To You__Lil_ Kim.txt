Uh, uh

I gets right to the point (no time to play around)
When it comes to this cheddar (lay a nigga down)
Bust shots at his Rover if he dare come back around
Pay me on time or I gots to take mine
At first I seem friendly but that's just in me
I warn you, when I blow, it gets a little windy
You make me wanna fight you, I ain't nothin' like you
Y'all paper thin, my shit recycled
They call me Lil' Kim a.k.a. Cover Girl
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another fuckin' world
Niggas buy me glass slippers and diamond fingernails
And aw, shit, I got it all in this bitch

Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin' in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin' in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash

To all my bitches in the strip club shakin' they ass
(I ain't mad, do your thing, mami) Get that cash
And all my hustlin' niggas still out on the ave
Fightin' over blocks and who got the best rocks
And goodness gracious, the struggle never stops
The things we all do to keep our pockets filled with knots
People fuck to my music, they say it's pornographic
My Billboards is nice, one day gon' be a classic
I fuck with dudes, with members only jackets
That sleep on brass beds with money for a mattress
Gettin'-money bitch, and I roll with dimes
Take pictures with our nines on the cover of New York Times
Tattoos down our spine with the picture of a dime
Cuttin' niggas short like inmates for phone time
Everything I get is custom made
Niggas wanna get laid, I gotta get paid (the papers)

Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin' in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin' in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin' in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga, pass that
We rollin' in tinted Nav's, TV's in the dash
See, we love the cash1Embed
