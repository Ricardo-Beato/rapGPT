It's hard to picture a nigga not getting money
J. Cole living bummy? Hahaha that shit is funny
I’m focused on that cash, I just laugh at them bastards
Eligible bachelor, finna get my Bachelor’s
And if this rap shit don’t work, I’m going for my Master’s
Still scouting hoes on the first day of classes
Keep up with the asses, keep up with the grades
A nigga straight A’s like the Braves
She got me in her dorm room, talking 'bout her room ain’t clean
And she wanna fuck, but wait until her roommate leave
Now I could give a damn if her roommate seen
'Cause if the girl get excited, she’s invited (haha)

If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey, and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

Yeah, uh, I hate to brag, well nah I don’t, the big man on campus
I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga glances
And if your ass is dumb you won’t even get a chance
'Cause I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga answers, yea
And if I hit ya shorty, keep it on the low
This shit just like high school, the people wanna know
I see you haters mad, but I ain’t mad at y’all niggas
We get ass like them basketball niggas, I’m ballin’
Got a Sidekick so them hoes don’t be callin’
Hit me on AIM, ay what’s your screen name?
When I start typing in, a nigga’s got some mean game, yea
And when I whip it out, shit she gonna think she seeing things, but
Back in Carolina I miss home badly (yeah)
It’s funny hoes I couldn’t have is tryna bag me
But I’m in the G with this freaky-ass Aggie
She said she want it from the back, gladly
You might also like
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me

I’m skipping class just to get some ass, living fast
In college but don't sleep, nigga, my jab quick as Zab's
So kill that old college gangsta shit we don't believe
You mad 'cause your girl on Facebook poking me, so uh
You know the G, I hit her up like “Hello Elle
I see you looking right the other day, LOL
So, what’s good with you?”
She hit me right back like “Shit, what’s good with you?”
You know I like that, so of course I write back
Hit her with some nice chat
Same night she in my room, lights off I strike that
Yeah I put game right, but that’s your wife, nigga take her
I bust then I kick her ass out to write a paper, yea (hahaha)
A nigga doing homework, drinking like a fish
It ain’t a weekend that I’m sober
Fighting hangovers on my way to my internship
And I forgot to study for my midterm, shit!

Hahahaha, wooo!
Ay, this is straight through, nigga
No, no fucking, no double takes
This is straight through the whole shit nigga
Check it out man, tryna tell y’all niggas man
College is a good look
A real good look, my nigga
For more reasons than one, man
Know they try to keep us out of that shit though
That shit like extra expensive
I got scholarships though, so you know I’m not sweating that
I feel for my niggas that couldn’t make it man
Ay Mike we in there baby, haha
Ay they can’t, they can’t keep us out the G my nigga, you know
Then we all make it, nah, we ain’t all make it
Shout out to my niggas, man
All my niggas, yo
Whether you graduated or not
Whether you made it to college or not, nigga
Fayettenam, yeah, yeah
Class of 2007 man
Holla at me
I’m going to grad school though, you know?6Embed
