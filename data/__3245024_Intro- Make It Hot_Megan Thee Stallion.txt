Ayy, yeah, make it hot (Woo)
Come up in this bitch, make it rock (Rock)
Put it in your face, make it pop (Ahh)

See, I already peep where you lacking
You ain't even hear me when I came in the back end (Bitch)
Oh, there I go, Stallion ho, something like yo' daddy though
See me out in person now you know what niggas trippin' on
I had to cut the steak, no red meat on my lobster plate
I'on go back and forth, I'on play them games
I let the bitch play herself, that's masturbate
I'm new in the game, that's rookie (Yeah)
Ain't nobody had these cookies (Nah)

Bitch, I'm real in the field, you a practice mat
And I'm comin' for your neck, better watch your back
Hello? Who is this? (Who is this?)
