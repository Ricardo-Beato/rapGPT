It's the Almighty So and Almighty Scream nigga connected
For the motherfuckin' streets nigga
Almighty So
How y'all niggas love that?
(DJ Scream!)
I mean...
(Hoodrich, bitch)
Niggas know how I rock
Bow down, bitch
My name King Sosa now
My name King Keef, It ain't Chief Keef no mo'

They want the old Sosa, for what though?
That's a crazy, low-down, dirty cut throat
I'm smokin' earth, let me show you how my heart go
Got my nine on me, bitch, Rondo
I brought the bank out, Wells Fargo
You ain't gettin' money, boy, that not yours
I bought a pint of lean, I'ma sip it by myself
Sneak diss and find yourself by yourself
'Member on the block, posted by myself
That bitch told me to control myself, I told her to go find yourself
Cdai got 22 shots, he coming all by his self
Wait, no, he got 5 people with him so nigga, go hide yourself
You ain't gettin' money, you lil lying self
Get a 100 thousand dollar check and spend it by myself
Bitch, don't miss this jet, I'll get in it by myself
And if I wanna fuck, I'ma hit it by myself
You might also like
That bitch wanna picture by herself, by herself
I just drunk a pint of lean by myself, by myself
You ain't squad, bitch, I'll leave you by yaself, by yaself
And go and get this money by myself, by myself

I got some niggas that's some hittas by they self
Don't care if you with them niggas or if you by yourself
T-Roy got a gun that's bigger than him
And he gon' blow that bitch all by his self
He don't miss, he gon' leave the right one left
Can't find a bitch, you say you see the right one, where?
I gotta glo, I know that people like to stare
Baby, you gotta glo up one day, you might as well

You want that hot shit?
Pull up on yo' block, let that Glock spit
Two jocks in my hand, you on that opp shit?
Broad day, out the car with the mop sticks
Have you running to your broad like, "Aw shit!"
I'ma hitta by myself, you are not shit
1017 Glo Gang, these hoes on our dick
I'ma hitta by myself, you are not shit
1017 Glo Gang, these hoes on our dick
That bitch wanna picture by herself, by herself
I just drunk a pint of lean by myself, by myself
You ain't squad, bitch, I'll leave you by yaself, by yaself
And go and get this money by myself, by myself2Embed
