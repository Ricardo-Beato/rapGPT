51 ContributorsShine On Lyrics
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book of right-on's right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book of right-on's right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book of right-on's right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book of right-on's right on, it was right on

Uh, now, they lost it I found it, we leave 'em astounded
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease
Got it, capisce? Hungry as hell trying to eat now
Success is the only thing that can complete us
Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus
Close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this (Logic)
Now I've accepted I'm not from the hood
Cause sellin' crack and bustin' gats don't make my raps good
See this is me, L.O.G.I.C. reppin' MD to the fullest
Push us to the limit but never pull us, now
I can't wait 'til I see my name in neon
That fly shit I be on flowin' for eons
Every day I take chances, Celine Dion
Said every day I take chances, Celine Dion, let's get it
I'm a diamond in the rough, but I shine like disco
Surrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco
I haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?
Up a million percent until they finally hear this though
Bumping up in they city like, "oh my God, this go"
My business getting better every year like fiscal
Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil
I'm a original see but they trace like stencil
A stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
'Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine
I did it in 21, see I'm ahead of my time
'Cause when I flow the crowd never roll 'cause I rock
On the road to success, haters in my blind spot
'Cause I got no time to bullshit

We should shine a light on, a light on
