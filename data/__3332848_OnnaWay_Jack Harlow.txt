Tell them boys I'm on the way with it (hooooo-hoooooo)
Ain't shit changed, but the goddamn slang
And the people tryna' hang with us
Y'all should know that I ain't playin' with it
Girl you know I get tired of the same ol' thing
So that's why I couldn't stay with it
I ain't mean to do you wrong though, hey
Know I beat it like a bongo, hey
So her best friend hates me now
But I ain't trippin off what y'all gon’ say
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it
Ain't shit changed, but the got damn slang
And the people tryna hang with us
Tell them boys I’m on the way with it

Something ‘bout the east end at night
Floatin’ through ya neighborhood below the streetlights
And I’m headed to ya culdesac
Told me park a couple houses down
Cuz your neighbors on surveillance
As a favor to ya parents while they out of town
I been tryna' catch a vibe from ya
That's exactly why I texted 'Hi' to ya
Wouldn't believe me if I told you that I’d never lie to ya
And you shouldn't really
I’d explain it, but you couldn't feel me
She said it wouldn't kill me just to have a real conversation one time in my life
I don't know what's wrong with me, girl I know you right
Staring at the ceiling while I listen to you talk about the things that i be thinkin’ bout too
And everything made sense for a second right then, but tomorrow I won't have a damn clue
You might also like
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it (hooooo-hoooooo)
Ain't shit changed, but the goddamn slang
And the people tryna' hang with us
Y'all should know that I ain't playin' with it
Girl you know I get tired of the same ol' thing
So that's why I couldn't stay with it
I ain't mean to do you wrong though, hey
Know I beat it like a bongo, hey
So her best friend hates me now
But I ain't trippin off what y'all gon’ say
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it
Ain't shit changed, but the got damn slang
And the people tryna hang with us
Tell them boys I’m on the way with it

Purple lights lighting up the basement
Lookin’ out the window when the sun down
Take it as a perfect indication that my brother might not ever have to work another day shift
Thinkin’ back when all of us in town
Remember we was always ridin’ around
Doing nothing, and that shit be so nostalgic to me now, like fuck
Ain't no option, man, I gotta make y'all proud
‘Cause the shit is in my blood, in my genes, you gon’ need some better denim
Local scene fucking with you 'til you doing better than 'em
They the type that's gon' pretend that something you said offend them
Just so they can have their boys hold ‘em back
Like, "Lemme hit ‘em"
What a stupid ass evening
But I could prolly use a ass beatin’
Help me write about something besides what I was doing last weekend
And the girls that I be fucking who be chewing Jack's semen
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it (hooooo-hoooooo)
Ain't shit changed, but the goddamn slang
And the people tryna' hang with us
Y'all should know that I ain't playin' with it
Girl you know I get tired of the same ol' thing
So that's why I couldn't stay with it
I ain't mean to do you wrong though, hey
Know I beat it like a bongo, hey
So her best friend hates me now
But I ain't trippin off what y'all gon’ say
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it
Ain't shit changed, but the got damn slang
And the people tryna hang with us
Tell them boys I’m on the way with it4Embed
