Ladies and gentlemen
People with jobs, people without jobs
Middle class, upper class, high class, all that
Cats, snakes, chickens, ducks, elderly people, and twerkers
I presents to you:
Fre— Fre— Fre— Fre— Fresh (DJ Mannie—)
Fre— Fre— Fresh (Mannie)
Fre— Fre— Fresh (DJ Mannie—)
Fre— Fre— errr— (Young ladies!)

Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out, and do the hump
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out, and do the hump

Well, I'm fly as a son of gun, son of a Stunna, yep
High as a 757 going to Heaven—who?
Weezy F., your reverend, preach about me
I'm the god, one-seven, Apple and E
I'm the Cash Money Mak'veli, y'all ain't ready
Quick, fast, like Tom Petty, y'all just petty
Eighty-two, I was born ready, I'm too ready
Y'all Betty Crocker baller blockers, I'm too heavy
Meatball Lamborghini, top spaghetti (Ugh)
Seats Ragu, ah, twenty the shoe
Boo, me and you got plenty to do
I don't need no pool, I'm swimming in you
And I sleep with the sharks, shawty, on that water-water
In the Bimmer 840, mama, shake something for me (Yeah)
And it don't make sense if it don't make that money
I'ma take that money, I'm straight Cash Money, yeah (Young ladies!)

Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump (Yeah)
Put your back in, back out, and do the hump (That's right)
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump (Yeah)
Put your back in, back out, and do the hump (That's right)

A-whodi, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-whodi, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-whodi, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-whodi, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)

Geah, I take off my brim
Moment of silence for the homeboy Soulja Slim, yeah
Fronting 'round here'll get your back chopped off
We do our own thing, we don't act like y'all
I say, black-white walls with the back swiped off, ayy
Y'all lil' busters just a tax write-off,
I'm a stand-up guy, not the type that fall
We don't breed them kind, but they bleed just fine, yeah
Weezy the Don, homie, read between the lines
If you can't, boy, read my nine
I'm going hard in the paint like Diesel time
Either I'm the illest cat doing it, or these cats is losing it
I be easy, fall back and be cool with it
Pallbearer is moving his dead flow, I'm through with it
I'm the sh— nah, nah, I'm sewer-rich
Weezy F. Baby, I do's this, yeah! (Young ladies!)
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump (Yeah)
Put your back in, back out, and do the hump (That's right)
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump (Yeah)
Put your back in, back out, and do the hump (That's right)

A-whodi, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-whodi, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)

A old-school gangsta mack like the eighties
I look like Cita and act like Baby, yep
You play with me, I react like the Navy
Or better yet the army—you gon' need them for me, yep
And your head is a bleeping target
You don't want me to see you with my peeking Tommys
Wizzle Fizzle, I keep it New Orleans
Sleeping with women that sleep with the Hornets, yup
A country boy in something foreign
'Bout a hundred thousand more than what you're in
You're not 'bout it, you freeze up like popsicles
Pop up on bicycles, pop y'all like spot pimples
Yeah, Wizzle Fizzle, original Hot Bizzle
Still Lil Wayne, but the dividends not little
Yeah, don't be surprised how the crown fit him
Uh, get down, uh, get down for the young'un', the Prince (Young ladies!)
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump (Yeah)
Put your back in, back out, and do the hump (That's right)
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump (Yeah)
Put your back in, back out, and do the hump (That's right)

A-whodi, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-whodi, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-whodi, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
