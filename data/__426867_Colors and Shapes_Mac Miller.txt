"Have I answered the question, 'Who am I'?"
"Mm-hmm"
"Well, I confront it all the time. We're teaching people how to use their head. The, uh... point is, that in order to use your head, you have to go out of your mind. You have to go out of all of the, uh, static symbolic ways in which you think."

If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary
'Stead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks with your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean, I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me, "How do you do?''
I told him, "I'm losin' my grip"
He told me, ''Son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''

Fall, ooh-ooh-ooh
Fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures
Of something that they'll understand
They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty
But march on the heart of this land, oh-oh
Why don't you turn around and go home?
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
These things that a man doesn't need
Take out the love and the passion and hope
And they fill it with nothing but greed
While floating through galaxies, they said I couldn't
I noticed how sad one can get
'Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful, I find
I can't understand nothin' no more

If I jump, let me fall (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh
If I jump, let me fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
