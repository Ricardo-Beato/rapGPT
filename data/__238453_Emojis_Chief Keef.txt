YearBeatz production, you understand?

Since that bitch like emojis, she like to text emojis
I sent her a emoji like "Don't call my phone please"
No, I don't like macaroni, no, you can't cook it for me
That bitch make me wish I never made that song
She get the stalking trophy
Ballin' hard, bitch, I'm Kobe
You ain't ballin' hard, I don't know you
Damn bitch, you nosey, please don't touch my phone please
Like sending my hoes emojis
I'm too high, you gon' blow me
Riding around smoking OG, no, I don't fuck with no G

Emojis, emojis, the bitch like to text emojis
Emojis, emojis, so I sent emojis
Emojis, emojis, and now we send emojis
Emojis, emojis, now she greets emojis
Emojis, emojis, I'ma act like emojis
Emojis, emojis, I will act like emojis
Emojis, emojis, I donâ€™t text her emojis
Emojis, emojis, I just send emojisYou might also like9Embed
