40 ContributorsRun Down Lyrics
That boy comin' live, cuh
Look, bah, grrt, woo
Yeah, woo

Look, see them hatin’ ass niggas talkin', tell 'em, niggas, stop it (Yeah, look, yeah)
Woo back, baby, run-down, chase ’em (Yeah, bah)
Off the Perky (Woo), boy, I'm dangerous (Yeah)
I'm in the double R, shit look like a spaceship (Woo)
Yeah, huh, everything is updated (Look)

Soon as folk see my mans, so I'm droppin' the rakes
I ain't gon' stop until a body drop and I can't wait to see that day (Woo)
In my Ruth’s Chris from Chick-Fil-A and a fifty-cent cake (Woo)
Now it’s Mastro's for the steak (Mastro’s for the steak)
Yeah, I grew up in the hood (Hood) so please don't judge me by my ways (Baow)
Hands down, look, if I see a opp, it's a man down (Bah)
Hold on (Hold on), wait (Wait), I ain't never need a handout
(Nah)
They know my body (They know my body), when the Woos in the spot, all the opps ran out (Woo)

Look, see them hatin’ ass niggas talkin', tell 'em, niggas, stop it (Yeah, yeah)
Woo back, baby, run-down, chase 'em (Yeah, bah, yeah)
Off the Perky (Woo, yeah), boy, I'm dangerous (Yeah, yeah)
I'm in the double R, shit look like a spaceship (Skrr-skrr)
Everything is updated (Grrt)

A thousand ways to get paid (You know), 1090 be exact (Ha)
And I'm so stuck in my ways (Ways), that my bros steady movin' tact
Hold on (Grrt), hold on (Bah), uppin' the rake, you get rolled on (What?)
So many opps, so many shots, I don't know who we gon' roll-on (What?)
Slide through, servin' these niggas like drive-thrus
Red flag on, bangin' on niggas, yeah, I'm feelin' like Ryu (Suu Whoop), huh
Try who? Pussy niggas gon' try who? (What?)
Ran through a hunnid, nigga been a hunnid
Call up the Woos, they gon' slide through (Woo)

Look, talkin', tell 'em, niggas, stop it (Yeah, look, yeah)
Woo back, baby (Woo), run-down, chase 'em (Yeah, bah, yeah)
Off the Perky (Woo), boy, I'm dangerous (Woo)

Ayy, ayy, GDK, GDK, GDK, GDK, GDK, GDK, EBK
Move over, now it's gang in the place
You can't ID, all he saw was flames in his face
And the IG gettin' opps carried away, now the graveyard's runnin' out of space, ayy
.45 like Amazon Prime, put a nigga in the air in a day
I'm in that Rolls Cullinan
Touch right there in the doors comin' in
Smokin' Za', we got O's bomin' in
Foenem always got hoes comin' in (Whew)
Chain make 'em say "Woo" like Pop Smoke
And I fuck with the Woo, R.I.P Pop Smoke
OP from the Floss, my vato
G Herbo
Look, talkin', tell 'em, niggas, stop it (Yeah, look, yeah)
Woo back, baby, run-down, chase 'em (Yeah, bah, yeah)
Off the Perky (Woo, yeah), boy, I'm dangerous (Yeah, yeah)
I'm in the double R, shit look like a spaceship (Woo, yeah)
Everything is updated (Grrt)
Look, Woo back, baby, run down, chase 'em (Yeah, bah, yeah)
Off the Perky (Woo), boy, I'm dangerous (Yeah)

Everything is updated (Grrt)3Embed
