5 ContributorsLine It Up Lyrics
Look
I'm with the gunplay
These niggas wassup, but
If you wanna squabble, nigga
We can line it up (yea)
We can line it up (yea)
We can line it up, nigga (yea)
If you wanna squabble, nigga
We can line it up, yea
I got the cantaloupe
You know I keep it tucked, but
If you wanna squabble, nigga
We can line it up (yea)
We can line it up nigga (yea)
We can line it up (yea)
He gon' hit the County Jail
He gon' have to line it up

Ayo we can line it up like both of us barbers
We could shoot foul but why bother?
Go get yo' 
Cuz I'm gonna be waitin' there with the set there
We can get it on, something heavy
Fuck what you heard
It's hard to get rid of us
My team is goon
Your team is clitorus
Yea, I'm from Harlem
Where niggas flash cake where it's sunny
We make money money, make money money money
I came with answers
Ya'll think we dancers
But the big brothas of the cancers are playin' us
We know we gettin' guap
Big choice parked in the lot
Buyin' all the bottles in the spot
Drink in the air
You seein' me 2-steppin' to the music
I splash you, I would dare you to do shit
Keep it movin' or you might end up gettin' sniped home skillet
I got your wig piece  on sights, home skillet
You might also like
I'm with the gunplay
These niggas wassup, but
If you wanna squabble, nigga
We can line it up (yea)
We can line it up (yea)
We can line it up, nigga (yea)
If you wanna squabble, nigga
We can line it up, yea
I got the cantaloupe
You know I keep it tucked, but
If you wanna squabble, nigga
We can line it up (alright)
We can line it up nigga (alright)
We can line it up (alright)
He gon' hit the County Jail
He gon' have to line it up

I'm a AG 10th Ave Hydepark squabbler
...

I'm with the gunplay
These niggas wassup, but
If you wanna squabble, nigga
We can line it up (yea)
We can line it up (yea)
We can line it up, nigga (yea)
If you wanna squabble, nigga
We can line it up, yea
I got the cantaloupe
You know I keep it tucked, but
If you wanna squabble, nigga
We can line it up (alright)
We can line it up nigga (alright)
We can line it up (alright)
He gon' hit the County Jail
He gon' have to line it up1Embed
