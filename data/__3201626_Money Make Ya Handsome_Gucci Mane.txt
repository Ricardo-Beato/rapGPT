They love me for one thing
So I'ma keep some money
They love me for one thing
So I'ma keep some money

It's really gettin' outrageous, they stalkin' all my pages
They runnin' on the stages, and they say that I'm the greatest
They used to call me ugly, but now they say I'm handsome
I pull up in that Phantom, she took my dick for ransom
I said I was the greatest, some people call me crazy
A lot of people hate me, but still they imitate me
This watch here cost an eighty, Guwop's an eighty baby
Grew up in ATL but don't do no roller skatin'
Lil' mama wanna suck me and she ain't never met me
She said she had a dream that she fucked me in my Bentley
Baller of the century, and they could never clone me
He say he worth a mil, but I got a million on me

Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money
You might also like
I do it with no effort like I don't even want it
I just built me a mansion, so big I feel it's haunted
I got so many diamonds that I don't even flaunt them
She think her pussy diamond but I don't even want it
Call it perfect timing, I don't have no opponents
It ain't no competition, 'cause they don't really want it
A bitch'll slit her wrist just so she can be my sidepiece
She wanna stand beside me, I just threw up a nine piece
If she thick as a horse I might buy that bitch a Porsche
If she mean nothing to me, Wizop I'm worth a fortune
I do it with no effort like I don't really want it
He say he worth a mil but I got a million on me

Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money

So I'ma keep some money
So I'ma keep some money
They love me for one thing
So I'ma keep some money
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money
Money make you handsome, even if you're ugly
Money make her fuck me, she wanna fuck my money
All my bitches love me, they love me for one thing
Money keep her coming, so I'ma keep some money5Embed
