When I was just hustlin' broke, didn't nobody see me through it
Word to my mother, niggas knew it, but I still went through it
Snooze, then you lose, guess I snoozed 'cause I still went through it
Cried 'bout the Bentley coupe, ooh, man, I still went through it
Now I run my millions up, niggas wonder, "How he do it?"
When I run my mills up, can't nobody see me do it
Last album deal up, labels tryna see me through it
Shorty put them Ms up, niggas thought he really blew it

Now I keep an S on my chest, baby
I saved the world in a dress, baby
Paranoid, them demons want my flesh, baby
Fell in love with sippin' the Tech, baby
I just wanna hustle the best, baby
Keep the money close, I don't trust, baby
Run up on me, told you I'm gon' bust, baby
Tryna keep me goin' when I nut, baby

Say you don't love me, better look me in my eyes
Tried to play me, your face looked surprised
I told you day one I was gonna find out
Heard 'bout you sneakin', bringin' niggas in your house
I feed the block, I make 'em hustle, get your crumbs up
We know you freaked that little bitch, you can't tongue us
She broke my heart and basically told me get my lungs up
Ever since then, I don't love again
She tried to tell me I wasn't him
My self-confidence 'bove the rim
Got a few brothers in the pen
None of they Green Dots in
They got chains on and iPhoned up
Hublots on and they bracelet diamond cut up
He ready to get it on, don't wanna talk 'bout love
That blade seven-fifty, shouldn't have ate that up
Couple niggas with me say they faced that up
They goin' headfirst, no time to ask what's up, yeah
That's the definition of you love me and trust me and fuck with me
The time come, you cryin' and you gone

Now I keep an S on my chest, baby (Ayy)
I saved the world in a dress, baby (Yeah)
Paranoid, them demons want my flesh, baby (Yeah)
Fell in love with sippin' the Tech, baby (Grr, grr)
I just wanna hustle the best, baby (Bitch, I just—)
Keep the money close, I don't trust, baby (I don't trust, nah)

Last album deal up, labels tryna see me through it
Shorty put them Ms up, niggas thought he really blew it1Embed
