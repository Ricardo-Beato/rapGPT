10 ContributorsShake Your Pom Pom Lyrics
I see you got low
And you got plenty more to show,(go)
Shake it like a pom pom,like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom,like a pom pom,(go)
Like you tryna win a contest for sure
Oh
I'mma show you how to shake it
How the booty shakin'
Show you how to shake it
Let you see the booty shakin'

See how the booty shake
Like an earthquake
There is no escape
When I shake it in your face
Now don't you wanna tape my booty shakin' on your tape
So show it to your boys
See the look on all they face
I move it to the left, move it to the right
Double time, double time, aight
Show 'em what they like
Look at it, look at it
Slow motion, freeze
Stop for the camera
Paparazzi wanna see
Cheese
Hello, hey how you doin'?
I shake it like this
Now let me see if you can do it
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop it on the one
Shake, shake, shake, shake
They faces all stunned
If you got it, got it, got it
Move it kinda fast
Boys all gas
While they tryna make a pass
(whistle)
Whistle while you work
Go' head do your dirt
Even if you like to flirt
Lift up your skirts
Then turn 'em out
One leg up
Go 'head shake it out
You might also like
I see you got low
And you got plenty more to show, (go)
Shake it like a pom pom,like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Go, like you tryna win a contest for sure
Oh, I'mma show you how to shake it
Show you how to shake it
Show you how to shake it
Let you see the booty shakin'

Now when I walk through the the door, door
Step aside, side
With thighs like fries we gonna size a supersize
Do milkshake go with that shake?
It sure do baby
Do milkshake go with that shake?
Uh huh
Now first you bend over
Put your hands on your hips
Then you make a stank face
Then go on and let it whip
Whip it like moms
Witcha witcha back then
Then catch your breath and then start it up again
One minute, two minute, three minute stop
Everybody drop like their hidin from the cops
Ay Yo, there will be no fights
Throw his ass out the club, cause we ain't turnin' on the lights
Sally got a big old donk
Oh yeah
And Missy got a big old donk
Oh yeah
I see you got low
And you got plenty more to show, go
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Go, like you tryna win a contest for sure
Oh, I'm a show you how to shake it
How the booty shake
Show you how to shake it
Let you see the booty shake

See I was sitting in the lounge
With my tight skirt on
And like a 3-D movie
He was watchin' the thong
All up in my grill
So he asked could he tag it
Two-timing from an ish like maggots
He tryin' to spit the game
What he had to say
Has anybody ever told you you look like Beyonce?
OK little boy want to boost my esteem
I said you need a rehab
Cause you look like a fiend
Don't want to start a scene
I ain't tryin' to be mean
And even if you spend your green
You can't get in between
Cause this here queen
Keep the nookie real clean
And like a diamond ring bling
See who wants get the wet dream
I see you got low
And you got plenty more to show, go
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Go, like you tryna win a contest for sure
Oh, I'm a show you how to shake it
How the booty shakin'
Show you how to shake it
Let you see the booty shakin'Embed
