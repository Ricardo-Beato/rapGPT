3 ContributorsWorkout Lyrics
What up, Jason?
Fatboy
 Brick Squad
Huh, Gucci
She's the workout
Yeah

Hypnotise, mesmerise,  fantasise
 nationwide
I'm working on her thighs, and she's working on my mind
She black on black, I'm killing that cat, so call that genocide
Gucci

From the windows, to the walls
You looking like you need a towel
Till the sweat drips down my balls
It's looking like we need a shower
I'm so high, cause she's so dope
Breathing like she's jumping rope
Just like a marathon runner,  she's so full of energy
Work it out
Work it out
You might also like
Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
Treat it likе a workout
She gon throw it down, and Imma push it up
She gon throw it down, and Imma push it up
Treat it likе a workout
Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
I'm gon throw it down, and she gon push it up
And Imma throw it down, and she gon push it up

I can be your trainer, baby, if you wanna workout
First day put your best heels on, then pull that skirt out
Second day sex tape, you can come to my house
Third day, chill at your house
I call your house my hideout
 make me so high, had to pull the purp out
 my purple 
I pull up in your hood, shawty, 
My ice will make you  my money's doing push ups
Gucci!
You've been on a tredmill, then you know how it feels
Say oo wee
You wanna stop, but you can't
Cause you making a face, like oo wee
When you feel like your heart is blowing up
And you feel like your legs won't hold you up
Say oo wee
Oo wee
Oo wee
Oo wee

Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
She gon throw it down, and Imma push it up
She gon throw it down, and Imma push it up
Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
Treat it like a workout
I'm gon throw it down, and she gon push it up
And Imma throw it down, and she gon push it upEmbed
