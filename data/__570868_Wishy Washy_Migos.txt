(Cheeze)

You know these hoes wishy washy (Wishy washy)
They'll fuck yo partner (They'll fuck yo partner)
Take all of yo guala (They'll take yo guala)
You know these hoes wishy washy
They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open they legs (Open yo legs)
They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread
Wishy washy (Wishy washy)
Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy (Go)
Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy (Wishy washy)
Wishy washy, I cannot trust them
Wishy washy, I cannot love them
You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy (Quavo)

Let me tell you a story
'Bout this lil' bitch named Tamara (Lil' story)
She'll let you smash for sure today (Smash)
And then smash yo partner tomorrow (Go)
She'll ask you can you take care of her
That'll cost you 'bout a couple hunnid dollars (Couple hunnid)
Everybody know lil' mama on go (Go)
Everybody calling her the gobbler (The gobbler)
Got hoes on hoes like a roster (Hoes on hoes)
Is it because of my posture? (Oh)
But I know it's cause a nigga dollars
She got a baby, no, I'm not the father (No)
She too wishy washy, she'll go in yo pocket (Wishy washy)
And break yo wallet and you know she got it (Oh)
But I got the knowledge to go tell her stop it
And she shake like a eight hit a corner pocket
You cannot play me (No, no)
You know you're too wishy washy (Wishy washy)
Kick her out the house politely (Kick her out)
We noticed you was too excited
No, we not going for it, no, we not going
You're too wishy washy, lil' bitch, and you know it (Know it)
Ain't got time for her, kick the lil' bitch out the front door

High class pimping these niggas, she got the formula (Pimping)
She sucking my anaconda, got the flower aroma
And on my mama I'm not fucking these bitches without a condom (Go, go)

Cut these bitches off like hibachi

Her mama keep begging her to stop it (Stop it)

Neiman Marcus shopping, she want me to spoil her rotten (Rotten)
But I know that she plotting, mama said don't trust nobody
This bitch is a vegetarian, all she want is broccoli (Cash)
I told her if she knew better, she would prolly do better (Do better)
That Rolex is a Sky-Dweller, got gold all on my Margielas (Margielas)
Pulling up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley
She asking me where my umbrella (Umbrella)
Fox fur, put on my mink, chinchilla
Flawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter (Burr, burr, burr)
Don't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head
These bitches, they can't wait to open they legs
But soon as she pull in my driveway
Pull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand
She know how to work the pots and pans (Whipping it)
She watching me like I'm on demand (Watching me)
She the bomb, Osama bin (Osama bin Laden)

They'll fuck yo partner (They'll fuck yo partner)
Take all of yo guala (They'll take yo guala)
You know these hoes wishy washy
