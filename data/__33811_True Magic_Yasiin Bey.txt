Bismillah ir Rhman ir Raheem
Def on the speak
Epik on the beat

Champion chronicle, M Def remarkable
A breeze through the street
Like the most potent ganja fume
The non-stoppable 'A' article arsenal
True legendary Zulu Johnny stomper dude
Held responsible, bright, black, phenomenal
M mastered the magical, ceremony classical
Black hand touch the intangible, strong hold
And get 'em all with or without the barcode
Y'all know, who stay frontin' like y'all don't
Stay gone, brother stay home keep the K close
At the crime court keep a case low
Flaco got to keep a pace though
Baby, make no mistake about it
I remember them days without it
Vibrated a major wattage
My gate safe and solid
My flow translate to major dollars
New ways and options
New days new plagues and problems
News page all the rave about him
"It's so good, so hood, nothin' changed about him"
