50 ContributorsHam ‘N’ Eggs Lyrics
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Ay yo, Phife do you eat em? (No, Tip do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all (Again)
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?) Nope
Not at all

A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?
Some veggie links and some fish that stinks
Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house
Smelled like she conjured up a mouse
Eggs was fryin', ham was smellin'
In ten minutes, she started yellin' (Come and get it!)
And the gettin's were good
I said, "I shouldn't eat it", she said, "I think you should"
But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians
No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian
Strictly collard greens and the occasional steak
Goes on my plate
Asparagus tips look yummy, yummy, yummy
Candied yams inside my tummy
A collage of good eats, some snacks or nice treats
Apple sauce and some nice red beets
This is what we snack on when we're questin'
(No second guessin')
You might also like
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Ay yo, Phife do you eat em? (No, Tip do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all (Again)
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?) Nope
Not at all

Bridge!

Now drop the beat, so I can talk about my favorite tastings
The food that is the everlasting
See I'm not fasting
I'm gobbling, like a dog on turkey
Beef jerky, Slim Jims, I eat sometimes
I like lemons and limes
"And if not that, I get the Roti and the Soursop"
Sit back, relax, listen to some hip-hop

Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes
A sight for sore ones and some bore pies
And other goodies that are filled with goop
With fried apple roots
Delectable delights, control my appetites
Mines is for me, right, but I know what I like
Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner
Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin' winner
When breakfast time comes, I don't recognize
Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chides
Mixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes
Or anything with flair, cook it, I'm in there
Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose
This is how it goes
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
A yo, Phife do you eat em? (Nah, Tip do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all (Come again, y'all)
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?)
Nope, not at all
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Afrika do you eat em? (No, Pos, do you eat em?)
Hell yeah, all the time
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Phife, do you eat em? (Nah, Tip, do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?)
Nope, not at all
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Afrika, do you eat em? (No, Gary, do you eat em?)
Yeah, all the time
