16 ContributorsImma G Lyrics
This is for my mothafucking Compton babies
And all the wild blocks that drove us crazy
Dominguez Hospital born
Niggas dying fast no life insurance
Black ski mask green leaf body bag liquor poured
So much 40 oz poured it's like the curb's made of gold on the ave
Bullets got no names on it so if a girl get hit the response of it was like our bad

That's the mind of state, rap niggas meet your fate
Say hello to the hip hop's Norman Bates
I ain't even burn 'em yet
Dave Chapelle these niggas are half baked
Well done when the second first come
I have an acquired taste
I will not let not one MC go to waste
I will eat all day
I will not, cannot lose, comfortable at the top
I'm sittin' down my legs  are crossed like i had (?) shoes

I tell dude, i ain't worried about these rap dudes
They're not in my league, the West coast is me
I'm, sub-zero, I put your career on freeze
I put it on Hov like I had (Calvin Jeans)?
I'm nightmare on Elm Street, come right through your dreams and
Delete you like an unwanted movie scene
Say hello to the team, ain't ya?
You're scared ain't ya?
The world is anxious for my LP
Get pop grades, i get an A-plus, you get a D
Fucking failure!You might also like2Embed
