5 ContributorsWatch Your Back Lyrics
You better watch yo back, motherfuckers is grimey down here
You get stuck up, stabbed, shot the fuck up round here
Son I move wit my vest and my hammer, I don't care
Niggas try and front on me and I blame em right here
You betta watch yo back, niggas be on dat bullshit down here
So I gotta move round wit a full clip round here
Cause lil' sneaky mufuckas will pull shit round here
Next thing you know you wakin' up...

When I say I'll lay a nigga down I put that on my momma
Niggas gonna see it's real when we get in the dramma
I ain't fightin' wit these faggots ima back out the lama
And start lettin' off until niggas is no longer problems
I watch the blood seep in the street, I'm swift wit the heat
I hit a nigga quick, Know why? niggas hit me
They call me 50 my aka is two gun Charlie
Find me up at 4 in the mornin' to catch me a body
Waitin' for you in yo projects by your staircase door
Come out! Come out! pussy you can't hide from a war
I get impatient then I'm bringin' it to yo people, I ring the doorbell then I'm puttin' one through your peephole
Boy it's a no,no to fuck wit me cause i'm not your equal
They say i'm loco, the pump will make your fuckin' chest see-through
But on the low though I'll show you how them hollow tips eat through, your legs, your back, your head and your hat
You might also like
You better watch yo back, muthafuckas is grimey down here
You get stuck up, stabbed, shot the fuck up round here
Son I move wit my vest and my hammer, I don't care
Niggas try and front on me and I blame em right here
You better watch yo back, niggas be on dat bullshit down here
So I gotta move round wit a full clip round here
Cause lil' sneaky mufuckas will pull shit round here
Next thing you know you wakin' up...

When I'm gunnin' at yo ass wit the chrome
Kid you runnin' outta town like a boost mobile phone
Yea the tech jam but it really don't shoot bad
I'll turn yo head into a fishnet doo rag
I got bricks of that raw sittin' in that rice man
And a long fo'fo when I'm at da dice game
You won't catch me slippin' when I'm hittin' them licks
I roll 4,5,6 wit my hand on my shit
I'm a gangsta on point ready to flip
Fo' you dummies i got dumb dumsb all in my clip
I got bundles of that D man I'm tryin to get paid
So I'm makin moves fast like my name was D. Wade

You better watch yo back, muthafuckas is grimey down here
You get stuck up, stabbed, shot the fuck up round here
Son I move wit my vest and my hammer, I don't care
Niggas try and front on me and I blame em right here
You better watch yo back, niggas be on dat bullshit down here
So I gotta move round wit a full clip round here
Cause lil' sneaky mufuckas will pull shit round here
Next thing you know you wakin' up...Embed
