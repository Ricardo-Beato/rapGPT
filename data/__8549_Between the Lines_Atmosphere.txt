16 ContributorsBetween the Lines Lyrics(What it is, it ain't, and what it ain't, it is
It's the theme of where we're goin')

See the police man, notice the lonely man
How do you think he keeps his head on straight?
Can you feel his rhythm? What do you think he visions
When he squints at the line from behind those shades
Feel the summer's crest, overdressed
So much sweat, his skin begins to chafe
It's the surface wet, the nervous mess
Overbearing and jaded from carrying the weight
Irritated and constipated
And its all covered, player hated, funneled and consolidated
Into the shell of one man with a gun
Riding that thin line between the program and the sun
And I don't hate you, I'm trying to relate to
Wishing you could find a trap door to escape through
But if I see you as a threat to my seedling or my sibling
I'll die to pull the plug on your machine

And I just might just find somebody
And I just might just love somebody
And I just might just feel somebody
And I just might just kill somebody
You might also like
Can you see her?
She spends her whole day in a theater
Living her time in the life that she would prefer
And she stirs nothing, comes and goes she wishes
Surroundings oblivious to her whole existence
But if they only knew
About the thoughts that she can't seem to stop from coming through
Coming across
At a loss for dialogue
Walking through the fog
With her eyes closed and her mind gone
And now she lives in the films that she sees
And daydreams that she kills us repeatedly
I'm impressed with the tolerance she brandishes
If it was me, I would snapped from the sheer overanxiousness
I'm waiting for the day she strolls through Muddy Waters
And slaughters sons and daughters and bloodies mothers and fathers
Lovely little case study castaway cutie
Masturbating in back of that matinee movie
And someday, one day, when the credits roll
She'll hold a pocket full of gunplay for the ignorant souls
Then we'll know to what death awake touch the sleep
Make me walk the thin line between shallow and deep end

And I just might just find somebody
And I just might just love somebody
And I just might just feel somebody
And I just might just kill somebody (myself)
He used to write his rhymes and recite his lines all the time
Sometimes he'd make them up right off the top of his mind
After doing shows for years, getting respect from peers
Killed the ego, looking at these people like they're weird
Road trips, turned into head trips
Became a hunger for sedatives and eccentric etiquette
Optimism needs to feed off self-esteem
But it seems that he doesn't see it, hasn't felt a thing
Records sell well, but still underground
Travels town to town
Holding hands with fans that love his sound
When it comes around let's hope he can enjoy it
Don't slow down momentum, afraid he might destroy it
When he stops to shake the hand, I doubt they understand
That here now stands only the shadow of a man
Having a hard time with life on a drumroll
Walking that high-wire, passing it off as humble
But it's a thin line, between screams and smiles
Seen the miles, wishing he can go home and read to his child
But tonight's the last day, put the butt in the ashtray
Locked the door and slit both wrists backstage


Onwards, forwards continuance renaissance
Encore, ignorance wrapped inside of innocence
Onwards, forwards continuance renaissance
Encore, ignorance wrapped inside of innocence
Onwards, forwards continuance renaissance
Encore, ignorance wrapped inside of innocence
Nothing but love for the music and its offspring
Bouncing off the boxsprings and trying to make it to the crosses
I just might just....
I just might just....
I just might just....(fade out)2Embed
