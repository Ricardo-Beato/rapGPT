25 ContributorsSlam Dunkin Lyrics
Baby, A-L-M-I-G-H-T-Y
S-O-S-A
Baby, you know that I'm that guy

Baby, A-L-M-I-G-H-T-Y
S-O-S-A
Baby, you know me, I'm that guy
I'm smoking on this D-O-P-E
And this shit it got me high
And I know you wanna be on T-O-P
But just go down for right now
I'm on this P-R-O-methazine
About to pour me a cup right now
This bitch brother wanna sit next to me
I charged his ass like 25 thou
Baby, you know how I'm rocking
Broke the rim, ballin' so hard I'm slam dunkin'

Got this 30 on me it's tall, Tim Duncan
Give them two shots a piece, I call it slam dunkin'
Hell yeah, I eat, I ball, Denver Nuggets
Little niggas think they flexin' with their little muscles
She diggin' me, I figured it
I'm smokin' on that deadly shit
Baby, you's a divalent
P.R.A the expensive shit
I ain't got no time for it
Might try to set me up, I got my nine for it
Finna pour me up a four and hit White Castle bitch
Because I am high as shit
Baby, is you drunk or some shit?
I know you ain't tryna drive my shit
I don't wanna beat your ass
'Cause I don't wanna go down and shit
I just want some top or some shit
I know you wanna be crowned and shit
But baby, I'm Almighty So
I ball like I'm the Mavs and shit
Clip too long
Got my guns showing
I love getting money, I got money pouring
Try to take it, I ain't gotta do nothing, I got my youngins blowing
I'm the CEO but ask the squad, I'm the youngest boy

Baby, you know me, I'm that guy
I'm smoking on this D-O-P-E
And this shit it got me high
And I know you wanna be on T-O-P
But just go down for right now
I'm on this P-R-O-methazine
About to pour me a cup right now
This bitch brother wanna sit next to me
I charged his ass like 25 thou
Baby, you know how I'm rocking
Broke the rim, ballin' so hard I'm slam dunkin'16Embed
