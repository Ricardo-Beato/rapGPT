3 ContributorsSets Up Lyrics
(Sets up)
Chest out
In and out, in and out
Lift your arm, lift your arm
In a circle, in a circle
Swang out, hang out, bang out
Show these motherfuckers right where you from
(Sets up)
Chest out
In and out, in and out
Lift your arm, lift your arm
In a circle, in a circle
Swang out, hang out, bang out
Show these motherfuckers right where you from

Coolest of the cool, I'm the goddamn man
Heater so hot need a god damn fan
Everybody want gangsta, suckas don't live it
Til' they talkin' through that glass, like "See you in a minute"
That's not the Bigg Boss Dogg
I been in it since a youngin', I'm a Eastside hogg
21st Street ridin', rollin' with my partners
Hat to the back in a rag spillin' vodka
Stompin' through the city in my big blue Chuck's
Lil' homies on the corner not givin' a fuck
So I chunked up the set like "What's happenin' with you?"
"Shit, I just do what I do, I'm just stackin' it too"
Is what he said to a loc as I dipped on out
Or as we say on the Eastside, you Cripped on out
See the sunshine and palm trees, livin' it up
Don't forget the block boys givin' it up
Where you from, loc?

For the rules of the game, represent your shit
Flag around the steering collar makin 'em sick
Shoot, the L.B. made me, gangbang for real
If ya made it through the '80s I'm a product of the shady
Snoop D-O-dub, it's what I does
I'm worldwide love, the homies is like cuz
Stuck to the script and kept claimin' the team
They love it when I chunk it on the TV screen
Like a boss would do, how the fuck could you
Deny my gangsta? Haters in my rearview
All around the world, they respectin' a G
Overseas they respectin' the C, that's on me
I did it like I did it mane
Uh, if you ain't did it you ain't did a thang
Uh, you come through, you better holler at me
You need beats, you better holler at P
Now put your sets up

Lift your arm, lift your arm
In a circle, in a circle
Swang out, hang out, bang out
Show these motherfuckers right where you from

Lift your arm, lift your arm
In a circle, in a circle
Swang out, hang out, bang out
