11 ContributorsHeavy Wrist Action Lyrics
They got me back on my shit

I got pies, Duncan Hines, cookies and the cakes too
I'm bussin' down the whole I'm bout to cook the shake too
Gucci eatin' good in the hood how're you?
Supa' sized colored diamonds size of ice cubes
I'm real smart but I got a sick wrist too
I can read, I can write, I can sell white too
I'm servin' all the dope bois come to serve you
 past your curfew
My chain got pneumonia the watch is bird flu
I'm very thugged out and my homeboys too
I'm iced out shawty and my main chick also
Maserati Maserati rims dash also
'vette full of bricks bullfrog that'll cost ya
I coulda' Keshawn but I deon'd 'em
Under arm kush got it smellin' real musty
Sold a couple ounces just to buy some red monkey's

Heavy heavy heavy heavy heavy wrist action
Flush it with the water
Then you buy a charger
Nigga nigga nigga got the Gucci Mane cookies
If it don't jump man Gucci might cook ya
