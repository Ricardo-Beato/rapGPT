17 ContributorsTell Her Nothing Lyrics
Baby, you a turn on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Y-Y-Yung Lan on the track)

Baby, you a turn on, I'ma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby, you a turn on, I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby, you a turn on, I've been slowly waiting
Ain't no hesitating, girl my heart racing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing

Girl, I'm slowly waiting, I'm not hesitating
I can't tell her nothing, I want to have your babies
Oops I meant I want you to have my babies, ain't no pretending
Girl I'm winning, girl you winning, baby let's get it... Jenny
Pockets on Craig, I'm higher, I'm flyer
They mad, 'cause I ain't deny you, they gon' hate
They gon' try you, my pockets on Weight Watch
My heart beat faster than a stopwatch, she want to stop by
She want to pop lock, she want a drop top
She the top notch (Order top notch), I couldn't fucking leave
She was looking for me like a fucking cop
She throwing up signs, no stop
You might also like
Baby, you a turn on, I'ma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby, you a turn on, I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby, you a turn on, I've been slowly waiting
Ain't no hesitating, girl my heart racing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing

Be quiet, I can't tell her nothing, STFU, you can't tell her nothing
I blow bands on her, I spent lettuce on her
Buy her yellow diamonds, she's a damn Corona
I'm in Atlantic station, I'm geeked up, she got patience for me
She got to wait for me, I'ma be with her until we ancient, ya see?
She got big ol' buggers on her ankle and feet
And she ain't no hooker but she dancing for me
She accept my partner even though he a thief
Molly tan, don't end it and she like to hold my hand we in Lenox
She want to show out on all these bitches at M's
I know she bad for Young Thugger Thugger black cannon
I go slow like I'm screwed, I go fast like a semi

Baby, you a turn on, I'ma put my trust inside of your heart
Baby, you a turn on, I knew I was falling in love from the start
Baby, you a turn on, I've been slowly waiting
Ain't no hesitating, girl my heart racing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing, I can't tell her nothing4Embed
