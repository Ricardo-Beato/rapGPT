6 ContributorsLegendary (Mike Tyson) Lyrics"Ladies and gentleman
In this corner
The champion of champions
From Catskill, New York
Iron Mike Tyson"
And in the other corner
The lyrical champion
Hailing from Queensbridge, New York
Is the one and only
Nas
And now, ladies and gentlemen and boxing fans joining us around the world.  IT'S SHOWTIME!
Verse 1:
Spirit of the streets
Walks in the ring
From Brownsville to spar fit
To boxing king
Man or machine, an animal
Physical strength and intelligence
But that type of intellect
Y'all respect
To connect those punches
Still as a kid he stole lunches
To mak'in millions and the hundreds
Chaotic conscience
The rage, the stage, the grander
Had to endorse slander
Took it like a man
Cause the mighty stand alone
In the bigger ring hole
The penitentiary
Barbed wire and stone was amp up
They locked a champ up
Even my brains in handcuff
The robin hood, seasonal santa
And y'all give him nothin to begin with
Dilapidated buildings
The drug epidemics
Historical stories
Pain, love and glory
Mike Tyson
Never see another like him

Verse 2:
True legend
His hands was two weapons
Understand this minds a true blessing
Designer jewels and diamond
A modern day Jack Johnson
Flying private jets and fully protect'in
Automized with ladies Godiva complexions
Lots of sex'in
Hung with a lot of stars
Learned a lot of lessons
Between dead homies and best friends
And getting domed out in stretch Benz
Educated from the hood and pestilence
The dead presidents don't see your pockets
You just gett'in
You got a full court press for them
Benjamins, I've seen money be the death of men
It's a warriors world
Only the strong survive
Who's next to try
Who's next to be the next
T-Y-S-O-N
He gave us hope
May the best man win
Outro chorus:
Iron Mike is in the house

Nas: Legacy
Iron Mike is in the house
Nas: Legendary
