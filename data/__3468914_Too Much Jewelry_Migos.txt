79 ContributorsToo Much Jewelry Lyrics
(Zaytoven)
What's up Zay?
Trap Holizay
Solid since the first day
Allow me to lead the way

I just spent a cool half a ticket on my jewelry (ice)
Clear white diamonds make your eyesight blurry (blurry)
Excuse me I have on too much jewelry (skrrt skrrt)
Never too much, never too much, so much
I just cashed out on my neck, that's a house
Head out, fuck a spouse, we pop off, we ain't hearin' it (brrr)
So much ice, young nigga, he delirious
Never too much jewelry, I'm serious (no)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, once I get it, spend it (spend it)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, I'm a walkin' chicken (brr)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, this is not a gimmick (no)
Money comin' in, they think we the ones that print it

Nah f'real, we the ones that print it
We the ones that trend it, it's a slight few, ain't many
Started it from the beginnin' (back then), they say money make 'em envy (envy)
My diamonds drawin' attention (look) and they wet like Willie (splash)
Pocket cheesesteak, Philly (cheese), bitch bad and she with it (bitch)
But I won't give her a penny (nah), tryna go to Piccadilly (where?)
Rose gold's got drillin', oh what a beautiful feelin' (beautiful)
I'ma let you get the bitch (bitch), but I'ma go get me some millions (M&M's)
I chose to give me some paper (chose to), that was my own decision (mine)
Speed racin' in that Lamborghini, I done fucked around and blew the engine
I pour an 8, on top of 8 I just poured, drank fuckin' wit' my vision
200K, count it before I do shows and fuck your opinion (nigga, fuck, opinion)
They told me I wouldn't make it, said I wouldn't amount to shit (shit)
Nigga smilin' in your face, really want you in a ditch
Half a ticket on my neck, quarter ticket on my wrist
This that new Richard Mille plain Jane like a bitch
They think that this shit is new, but we been really doing this
Talkin' pointers but you don't get points and don't get no assists
They say the ones that quiet be the ones that rich as bricks
Wanna walk in my shoes, gotta take that risk (risk)

I just spent a cool half a ticket on my jewelry (ice)
Clear white diamonds make your eyesight blurry (blurry)
Excuse me I have on too much jewelry (skrrt, skrrt)
Never too much, never too much, so much
I just cashed out on my neck, that's a house
Air it out, fuck a spouse, we pop off, we ain't hearin' it (brrr)
So much ice, young nigga, he delirious
Never too much jewelry, I'm serious (no)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, once I get it, spend it (spend it)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, I'm a walkin' chicken (brr)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, this is not a gimmick (no)
Money comin' in, they think we the ones that print it

This ain't even all my jewelry (jewelry)
Never too much jewelry (jewel)
This ain't even half my jewelry (never too much)
Never too much jewelry (yeah)

Mike Dean, Zaytoven
You know how we do it
Never too much jewelry, jewelry
Too much ice (all these jewels)
Wassup, baby?
I see you bitch over there lookin', nigga, muah
Skeleton AP on my wrist, nigga
Takeoff just bought like eight plain Janes
Haha, know you're mad, nigga
I just spent a cool half a ticket on my jewelry (ice)
Clear white diamonds make your eyesight blurry (blurry)
Excuse me I have on too much jewelry (skrrt, skrrt)
Never too much, never too much, so much
I just cashed out on my neck, that's a house
Head out, fuck a spouse, we pop off, we ain't hearin' it (brrr)
So much ice, young nigga, he delirious
Never too much jewelry, I'm serious8Embed
