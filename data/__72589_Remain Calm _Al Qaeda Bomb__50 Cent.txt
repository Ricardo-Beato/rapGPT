14 ContributorsRemain Calm (Al Qaeda Bomb) Lyrics
Try to remain calm, you fucking with a don
Pocket full of green, green in the bong
That bitch with the bow-legged stance turning me on
Two mil' timepiece, rainbow Tourbillon
Niggas still want me dead like Osam'
But they ain't gon' make it they come at me wrong
Them niggas all workers, I'll smack the shit out they bosses
Ferrari, I'm stronger than 500 horses
Money is power, you niggas better wake up
My ear rings blinking, that's old shit from Jacob
Add it up, four plus four, that's eight karats
You can't run and get you a bill, you ain't got it
Blackjack we do that, ten grand a hand
You can get shot fucking with Floyd, that's my man
Billionaire brotherhood, we call this the Money Team
Pinky ring flawless, my God I'm gorgeous

Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, ho remain calm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, don't ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, nigga remain calm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, this a Al-Qaeda bomb

I'm chilling like a villain while I'm dealing, I am
Ruling while I'm cooling with my tool in my hand
Post up, coast up, this is my life, bitch
Up close on ya, you'll get stuck with a knife, bitch
Cuz burnt out, turnt out like a light switch
Got a lot of hoes, but Charlene that's my white bitch
The rest of my bitches, nah they ain't gon' like this
But I don't give a fuck cause they all love this nightstick
But I still remain calm, bang and drop bombs
Collar popped up, cool as the Fonz
Motherfucker! Have a seat and loosen up
Get a glass of some gin, now juice it up, deuces up
See it's a line there for a reason
And if you cross it, no more breathing, ya leaving
Believe it - we understand each other?
Cause I would hate to have to put a slug in ya, brother - ya dig?

Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, ho remain calm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, don't ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, nigga remain calm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, this a Al-Qaeda bomb
Four fifth on that shit, that Glock copped to ya face
My twat cocked in ya face, you know you wan' taste
Alexander McQueen, strapless with my back out
Six inch DaVinci's, a bitch finna act out
Niggas on my heels tryna find out what the head like
I know what the bread like, my butt give y'all headlight
Shine like I shine, night or daytime
But Nah, na na na na
Make a nigga wan' buy everything I say buy - ma na na na na
Get wet, I got that comeback, that crack
My assets is my ass, jack
Stun, I tell my niggas right where yo stash at
You fucking with a Southside bitch, I go where the money go
I'm madam put on a stroll, Get my money ho
Catch me in Ferragamo or Dolce & Gabbana
Or , I'm B squared up, what

Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, ho remain calm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, don't ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, nigga remain calm
Remain calm, you fucking with a don
Remain calm, this a Al-Qaeda bomb2Embed
