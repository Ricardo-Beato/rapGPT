Okay

I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)
I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)

I'm feelin' normal, yeah, I'm feelin' myself
Feelin' good, yeah, I'm feelin' my health
Got a couple plaques up on my shelf
Money in the safe at the crib just to feel my wealth
Think I'm gonna put it all on the line
I think I'm really gonna do it this time
I think I got a whole lot on my mind
Somebody tell God right now He need to hit my line (Yeah, uh)
You might also like
Now I ain't sayin' this my "Jesus Walks"
I'm just sayin', God, I need to talk
Too many kids in the community outlined in chalk
Scared of drive-bys when they should just be scared of the dark
Who's really doin' they part?
They say they don't want messages in rap, it ruins the art
Well, here I am, people, yeah, now tear me apart
So much happenin' in the world, I can't touch on every topic
I know You hear it in my voice, make the devil stop it
Too many people dyin' and baby mamas cryin'
It's been a long time, God, can You hit my line?
Evil politicians, people on Twitter bitchin'
Hashtaggin', but in real life, they never pitch in
I came with conviction, I hope You came to listen
No matter how much I ignore it, this message my mission
God, hit my line, this world is in critical condition
Like a fiend that need fixin', that done battled addiction
Been addicted to money, been addicted to fame
Addicted to arenas and people screamin' my name
But it's time to let go, it's time to make a change
So can You hit my line? I know You hear this rhyme
But come to think of it, You probably hear this all the time
Probably hear this all the time

I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)
I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)
I'm feelin' normal, yeah, I'm feelin' myself
Feelin' good, yeah, I'm feelin' my health
Got a couple plaques up on my shelf
Money in the safe at the crib just to feel my wealth
Think I'm gonna put it all on the line
I think I'm really gonna do it this time
I think I got a whole lot on my mind
Somebody tell God right now He need to hit my line
