3 ContributorsIntro (Gucci vs. Guwop) Lyrics
I'm Rico Wade in the latest shades
L.A. Reid and Babyface
DJ Paul and Juicy J
Master P with baby weight
J Prince, man, I'm Tony Draper
Radric with Clive Davis' paper
Lyor Cohen and Diddy Combs
In court with my jewelry on
Berry Gordy and Quincy Jones
What the fuck is Gucci on?
Suge Knight mixed with Eric Wright
Pockets fat as Barry White
Russell Simmons dressed in linen
Island hoppin' with different women
Bun B, Jay Z, I'm big pimpin'
Pimp C watchin' me from heaven
CEO I'm  status
ODB of east Atlanta
Luke Skywalker, they tryna ban me
'Cause these squares can't understand me
How I do it when I do it?
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis
Eazy E, I'm extra ruthless
Sign the check and write the music
Pump it, push it, pump it, push it and produce it
Make you think it's the real Gucci
Who the hottest? Me or Gucci?
Who gon' win? Guwop or Gucci?
Fed cases, mixtapes and movies
Ask me how I feel I'm Gucci
No one can beat me but Gucci

It looks like Gucci Mane might be behind bars until 2016
Today, the Atlanta rapper pled guilty to a gun possession charge
And according to reports, prosecutors want to jail him until 2016
The maximum sentence that goes along with this charge is 10 years
But with the plea deal copped today, Gucci is only expected to serve 39 months
Gucci has been in jail since September after cops arrested him
In a parking lot with a handgun
A hefty fine of $250,000 also goes along with the sentenceEmbed
