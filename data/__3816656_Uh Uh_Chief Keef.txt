The way that go I never ever know
Rollin' up Ps 'cause I'm cappin' that O
Get sparked from the heat, that was definite though
You can try to run but you catchin' them though
Wanna fuck in these mouth like I'm M&Ms though
It's a hit-and-run, hit the ambulance, ho
Ice in my cup, December 24
Smoke get me higher than the airfield though
Mama told me, "Never ever fear dough"
.45 bigger than a elephant though
Go to court smellin' like I sell elbows

You don't even know what come with that shit (With that shit, hey)
You better run-run-run up the blue bummers (Bummers)

We want all the smoke, we got mob fare (Mob fare)

Poppin' them pills still (Huh, still, yeah)
