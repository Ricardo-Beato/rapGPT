25 ContributorsDon’t Deserve It Lyrics(Intro: DJ Holliday)
Rich niggas is back
It’s the little Rochy right here
I know yall love it when we get together
Let’s get em Gucci
(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)
I’m walkin with my strap, I give a fuck a nigga searchin
Don’t keep it in the car, I got that pistol on person
You pissed Flocka Flame – you dissed the fuckin wrong person
Run up on Gucci Mane – you be another dead person
I toss em in the river – now the whole city searchin
The AK hit his ass and now that nigga need a surgeon
Try me in this club then I’m gon shut it down early
Scene was so sick that the police start hurling
(Interlude: DJ Holliday)
Undisputed Dynamic Duo in the building
Stand up for this shit man
We raised yall niggas
DJ Holiday, Gucci Mane
Trap Back 2 niggas
(Verse1: Gucci Mane)
I’m walkin with my strap, I give a fuck a nigga searchin
Don’t keep it in the car, I got that pistol on person
You pissed Flocka Flame – you dissed the fuckin wrong person
Run up on Gucci Mane – you be another dead person
I toss em in the river – now the whole city searchin
The AK hit his ass and now that nigga need a surgeon
Try me in this club then I’m gon shut it down early
Scene was so sick that the police start hurling
East Atlanta zone 6 niggas so thirsty
That shop with you Tuesday and rob your ass Thursday
One years old and he already start cursin
12 years old and he already start servin
You might also like(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
If you ain’t getting money then I think you don’t deserve it
You reach for my chain you be another dead person
Big Guwap, why they call me Mr. Perfect
Then look me in my eyes when you see me cuz you’re nervous
I murk your homeboy and I smoked a pound of purple
You’re talkin to the cops, pussy nigga I know you’re worthless
Hard top Rolls, smoking kush behind the curtains
The word just came in, wutchu wanna purchase?
(Verse 2: Gucci Mane)
Fuck it cuz the young nigga turfin
If you ain’t getting no money then these bitches feel you’re worthless
Oh you a live-wire? Then I’mma make you short-circuit
These clown ass niggas need to go work in the circus
Million dollar nigga but I still eat Church's
You try me in these Church's then my boy then start burstin
When he died and this Boosy mama feel he didn’t deserved it
Box cutter in my pocket, I carve yo ass up like a turkey
Put that on my squad, I ain’t gon let no nigga hurt me
My gun do all my talkin and I know you niggas heard me
Old school vet like I’m fuckin James Worthy
But I’m shootin from the corner like I’m fuckin Bobby Hurley
(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
If you ain’t getting money then I think you don’t deserve it
You reach for my chain you be another dead person
Big Guwap, why they call me Mr. Perfect
Then look me in my eyes when you see me cuz you’re nervous
I murk your homeboy and I smoked a pound of purple
You’re talkin to the cops, pussy nigga I know you’re worthless
Hard top Rolls, smoking kush behind the curtains
The word just came in, wutchu wanna purchase?
(Verse 3: Wooh Da Kid)
Money makin me, no it’s money makin Wooh Da
My youngin 13 like a 3rd world shooter
In a couple years he’ll be taking over blocks
AK47, got him takin over spots
The only thing I see in the mirror is me
Before you catch me slippin it’s gon be a first degree
Word around town you a motherfuckin hater
We fucked the same bitch, the only difference is you paid er
If you ain’t getting money you a motherfuckin joke
Reachin for my strap if a nigga going broke
Screamin adios, left from bacon from the toast
One minute here, next minute you a ghost (adios)
(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
If you ain’t getting money then I think you don’t deserve it
You reach for my chain you be another dead person
Big Guwap, why they call me Mr. Perfect
Then look me in my eyes when you see me cuz you’re nervous
I murk your homeboy and I smoked a pound of purple
You’re talkin to the cops, pussy nigga I know you’re worthless
Hard top Rolls, smoking kush behind the curtains
The word just came in, wutchu wanna purchase?1Embed
