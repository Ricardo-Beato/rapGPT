80 ContributorsDeeper Than Money Lyrics
People want to talk about what makes them happy
What really makes you happy?
Tell me what makes you happy
Makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you glad
Tell me what makes you happy
People say its money, give me the money
All the money (money)

If I could live forever and a day
Know I'd never fade away
But my life is not okay, I...
I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed
Life is fucking up my vibe, I...
I wish had a lot of money
Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper, you already know
My life would be so much better with cheddar
Only work as hard as I do for vendetta
Cause my ninth grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit
Wouldn't be nothing, working that minimum wage
And cooking McMuffins, so I'm puffing on this green
Wishing I had more money than I do
Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, ah!
And so I'm all about my business
Is there anyone who wit this?
Can a brother get a witness like: Ah—Ooh, Ah—Ooh
Wassup with it, come and get it
Tell me now what's on your mind
I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline
Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine
Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line
Somebody tell me now what done happen to society
My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety
They say that money cannot make you happy
Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke
And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?
Why you trying me, like ah...
You might also like
Now I'mma tell 'em what makes me happy
This what makes me happy, right here
Like this...

Jump up on that MPC, like a boss MVP
Cook up shit that make other producers wanna envy me
Master it then set it free, turn it into MP3s
Spin that shit up in Serato, I can feel the energy

This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper, deeper than money
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
You know its deeper, deeper honey
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than your money
My money, they money, everybody money
Said, this shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
It's deeper than money
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
I don't do this shit for nothing but myself
Think I need to focus more on my health
I do, I do—this the shit that I love
This the shit that I love
Comes straight from above
Off the top off the dome
Gotta get it, go home
Hella late, feeling good, got a lot on my plate
What the fuck is on my mind?
I just, I just want to rhyme
This the type of shit I got to do
Oh my God, what's the time?
Can you feel it right now?
Can you feel the whole style?
It's the type of shit, I gotta get it, gotta get it
I've been vibing out here in Malibu
Would you come through?
Tell me motherfucker truly what it do?
L-O-G-I-C, this is who I be
L.A. where I'm at, M.D. what I be
All that, all that
God, I can feel it, I can feel it
I'm a fly on the wall feeling ten feet tall
Right now this the type of shit, this the style
This the motherfucking style
And so I tell em...
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper, deeper than money
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
You know its deeper, deeper honey
This shit is deeper than money
Deeper than your money
My money, they money, everybody money
Said, this shit is deeper than money
Deeper than money
Deeper than money
It's deeper than money23Embed
