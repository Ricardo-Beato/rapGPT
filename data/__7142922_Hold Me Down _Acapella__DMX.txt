Oh, the King's back (Back-back-ba-back-back)
Yeah, bounce
Oh, oh (Come on)
Oh, oh (Come on)
Oh, yeah, oh
They don't know, they gon' find out
Time to find out

Hold me down
Hold me down
Even when the rain falls (Yeah)
Hold me down, oh (This is it, baby)
Hold me down
I'm just so thankful (Uh, yeah, rrr)

Everyday it gets darker (Rrr), the road gets longer (Rrr)
My body gets weaker (Rrr), my faith gets stronger (Rrr)
The Devil's working on me hard, because God loves me (Yeah)
As long as I'm in His graces, it's gon' get ugly (Hey)
But, only He can judge mе so
What another motherfucker say don't mattеr (Uh-huh)
So I avoid the chatter (Uh-huh)
That way I ain't gotta splatter with the rat-tat-tatta (Woo)
Watch what you say or you gon' wish you had'a (Yeah)
Check a nigga data (What?)
Ain't nan' nigga badder with the mic than the dog (Uh)
From the right to the wrong (Uh)
Still bite and go hard (Yeah) spaz to the left (Yeah)
And with the last of my breath (Yeah)
I'll beat that ass to death (C'mon!)

Hold me down (Uh, uh, uh, yo)
Hold me down
Even when the rain falls (Hey, hey, yeah)
Hold me down (Down), oh (Nigga don't need much)
Hold me down
I'm just so thankful (C'mon, get it)

I pulled in opposite directions, my life's in conflict (Uh huh)
That's why I spit words that depict the convict (Okay, ooh)
Man, if you not able to see
What I'm saying to you, then you not able to be (C'mon, ooh, yeah)
Just like reading the Bible to a baby (Uh-uh)
Some of y'all will get it (Uh)
But most of y'all gon' think I'm crazy (Oh no, no, no)
I ain't never gave a fuck about what you think (Okay)
What you think don't matter if you think yo' shit don't stink (Baby)
Man, it hurts when people that I love don't want me (Oh)
Want it all from me, then think they can judge me (Yeah)
Treat me like I'm ugly
I done did some dumb shit but I never been a dummy
'Cause I know God love me

Hold me down (Even when the rain falls)
Hold me down (Hey)
Hold me down (I'm just so grateful)
Hold me down (Hey, hey)
Hold me down (A nigga don't need much)
Hold me down (I'm just so thankful)
Hold me down (Even when the rain falls)
Hold me down (I'm just so grateful)
Nobody, nobody gonna take me down (Hold me down)
'Cause I been through it all (Hold me down)
Woah (Hold me down, hold me down)
Nobody, nobody gonna take me down (Hold me down)
Oh Lord, you wanna know how I survive
And it's all because of you, yeah
And I'm just so gratefulEmbed
