Could this thing be more?
You can never— this could be yours
If it's really meant to— baby, baby
'Cause I'm interested, baby, baby
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob

You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me
Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did

Takin' our memories on love and treatin' it like nothin'
Takin' our memories on love and treatin' it like gossip
It's my love from my grandmother make me gentle when I care for you
Tell me you fallin' out of love, it's breakin' my heart in two
I just don't wanna sit and pray, baby
Almost like it didn't happen to make you happy

You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me
Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did
You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me (You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me)
Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did (Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did)

Could this thing be more?
(You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me)
