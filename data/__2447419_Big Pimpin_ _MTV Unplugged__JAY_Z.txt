Everybody in here just bounce
Just bounce
Just bounce
Just bounce
Uh uh uh uh
I like, ok let's go
Uh Uh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Uh Uh Uh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Uh Uh Uh

You know I, thug em, hug em, love em, leave em
But I don't trust or need em
Take em out the hood, keep em looking good
With diamond cuts that'll freeze 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezing
Talking bout, what's the reasons
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word mama
Better trust and believe em
In the cut where I keep em
Til I need a what, til I need to beat it up then it's
Then it's "beep beep" and I'm picking them up
Let em play with the crick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good sex, I'mma break bread
So you can be living it up
Part with nothing, I be fronting
Me give my heart to a woman
Not for nothing, never happen
I'll be forever macking
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion, I got no patience
And I hate waiting, ho get your ass in and let's ride

What we doin' ya'll?
We doin'
Spendin' cheese we doin'
Big pimpin' on BLADES
We doin'
Big Pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga man B. Sigel Memphis Bleek
We doin'
Big pimpin'
Spendin' cheese we doin'
Big pimpin' on BLADES
We doin'
Big Pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga man Roots band on MTV
On the canopy, my stamina be, enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money too long for gamblin' with me but I'm
But I'm still sitting on BLADES hitting on crays
Sitting on the corner of my block hustling
Getting off K's, double what I paid
Getting it right through customs
It'll sell by night its egg shell white
I got so many grams if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimping, spending cheese
With B.U.N. B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got chickens in the back of the truck, laughing it up
Jigga Man: that's what's up

[Big pimpin' spending cheese
And we big big pimpin' on BLADES
Big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga man B. Sigel Memphis Bleek
Big pimpin' spending cheese
And we big big pimpin' on BLADES
Big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga man Roots band on MTV(8901654)
