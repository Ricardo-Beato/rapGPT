Shot, shot (Shot, shot)
Gun (Gun, gun)
Shot, shot (Shot, shot)
Gun (Gun, gun)
Gun
You wouldn't mind taking time out (You wouldn't mind)
You got good energy like a 5-Hour (Good energy like a 5-Hour)
Tell me what you like, I'ma tie it down
I bring you in, never steer you out

Baby, pop somethin' (Pop somethin')
Baby, they can't stop nothin' (They can't stop nothin')
You wanna ride with me, shotgun (Shotgun)
You wanna slide with me, shotgun (Shotgun)
Baby, pop somethin' (Pop somethin')
Go up and down like you dropped somethin' (Like you dropped somethin')
You wanna ride with me, shotgun (Shotgun)
Shotgun, shotgun (Gun)

Rainin' hundreds like they all ones
Your purse too full, girl, you dropped somethin' (Gun)
You off that pink molly, girl, pop somethin'
Ridin' sideways like we gon' chop something (Ridin')
Got a crystal pool, got a MAC-11
Got a chef that's whippin' up lots of spaghetti (Run)
Shouldn't've said, "Pop it, pop it," girl, they all jealous
I ain't talkin', girl, I'm makin' all promises
You might also like
Baby, pop somethin' (Pop somethin')
Baby, they can't stop nothin' (They can't stop nothin')
You wanna ride with me, shotgun (Shotgun)
You wanna slide with me, shotgun (Shotgun)
Baby, pop somethin' (Pop somethin')
Go up and down like you dropped somethin' (Like you dropped somethin')
You wanna ride with me, shotgun (Shotgun)
Shotgun, shotgun

Rainin' hundreds like they all ones (Rainin' hundreds like they all ones)
Your purse too full, you dropped somethin' (You dropped somethin')
'Bout to go to the dealer and cop somethin' (Let's cop somethin')
New wheels on the 'Rari with your top down (With your top down)
Ten thousand feet up, we get wifi (We get the wifi)
Swap the diamonds out like a montage (Like a montage)
We land the chopper on the front of the yacht (Land the helicopter on front of the yacht)
The white G-strings show ass shots (Show the ass shots)
My brother Detail live like Einstein (Like Einstein)
We in the Matrix, we can rewind time (Rewind time)
Thirty foot ceilings in my glass house (In my glass house)
You could've quit but you ain't give up on me, you stayed down (Stayed down)

Baby, pop somethin' (Pop, pop, pop, pop)
Baby, they can't stop nothin' (They can't stop nothin')
You wanna ride with me, shotgun (You wanna ride, ride, ride)
You wanna slide with me, shotgun (You wanna slide, slide, slide)
Baby, pop somethin' (Pop somethin')
Go up and down like you dropped somethin' (Go up and down)
You wanna ride with me, shotgun (You wanna ride with me)
Shotgun, shotgun (Shot, shot, shot, shot)
I'ma pop up, tell me where the fuck you at?
You get upset, you do some shit you gon' regret
It was dark, it was late, you were gone
Don't leave me alone in the dark thinkin' 'bout you
Ridin' shotgun, let the AC blow through your hair (Your hair, hair)
I secured this bag already, ain't got no care (No care, care)
Tell them bitches get off your dick, girl, it ain't fair (It ain't fair, fair)
Let's go flawless shopping, girl, this shit is rare (Shit is rare, rare, rare)

Baby, pop somethin' (Pop, pop, pop)
Baby, they can't stop nothin' (They can't stop, stop, stop)
You wanna ride with me, shotgun (You wanna ride, ride, ride)
You wanna slide with me, shotgun (You wanna slide, slide, slide)
Baby, pop somethin' (Pop, pop, pop, pop)
Go up and down like you dropped somethin' (Go up, up, up, up)
You wanna ride with me, shotgun (Gon' ride, ride, ride)
Shotgun (Gun), shotgun4Embed
