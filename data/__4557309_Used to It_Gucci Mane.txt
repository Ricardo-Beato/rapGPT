6 ContributorsUsed to It Lyrics
I'ma keep doing what I been doin'
Say I'm gettin' money, bitch, I'm used to it
Pull up to the club, got these hoes choosin'
I heard these niggas hatin', but I'm used to it
I'm drunk, so I'm swaggin' under influence
But gettin' dumb high, bitch, I'm used to it
When I send her back home, bet her hair ruined
But fuckin' niggas' bitches, man, I'm used to it

Touchdown with a hundred pounds
Dancin' in the end zone
Ballin' on you like a jump shot, oops, I meant field goal
Crossed the middle with a 50 pack, hit me, I'm open
I call the shots like Tebow, one man down, no jokin'
I'm 'bout the set like Strahan, oops, I meant Ray Lewis
Look how my crew do it
Droptop, I'm so foolish
 I'm Megatron
Got a mega bomb and I'm heavily armed
Gettin' Georgia dome in my Georgia home
Ho pass out when I perform
And since they put my stats on the internet
These bitches let me put my dick all in they neck
And what do you expect? I'm a pro-bowler
A hundred pack of Ace of Spades, I got a hangover
You might also like
I'ma keep doing what I been doin'
Say I'm gettin' money, bitch, I'm used to it
Pull up to the club, got these hoes choosin'
I heard these niggas hatin', but I'm used to it
I'm drunk, so I'm swaggin' under influence
But gettin' dumb high, bitch, I'm used to it
When I send her back home, bet her hair ruined
But fuckin' niggas' bitches, man, I'm used to it

Nothing 'bout this loot, woah
She love all my new songs
She say she wanna kick it, that mean "hit this with your shoes on"
Ha, look, don't mean to be too forward
Keep these bitches motivated, then they don't got no motives
Now does it?  cannot trust them
But I bet you there's a hater for every woman with my number
Youngin, hold up, hoes outside my hotel
And most of 'em got boyfriends, when I go in them, they like, "Oh well"
Holiday is my nigga, Gucci 'nem is my partner
Hookah bar for the boujee broads
Come and loosen up with this ganja
 partner
Pick and choose when I feel like flossin'
And I ball though, and you all broke, y'all fuck niggas ain't on yet
I'ma keep doing what I been doin'
Say I'm gettin' money, bitch, I'm used to it
Pull up to the club, got these hoes choosin'
I heard these niggas hatin', but I'm used to it
I'm drunk, so I'm swaggin' under influence
But gettin' dumb high, bitch, I'm used to it
When I send her back home, bet her hair ruined
But fuckin' niggas' bitches, man, I'm used to itEmbed
