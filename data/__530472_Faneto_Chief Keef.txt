I just got twenty for a fuckin' four (Twenty bands, nigga)
I spent that shit on a fuckin' coat (On my motherfuckin' coat)
Ripped my ear, now I got one earlobe (Bling, bling)
But I'ma still put some diamonds on it (Gang, gang, bling, bling)
Baby girl, these diamonds are not phony (They not phony, huh?)
This car I got, it came from Barcelona (Barcelona, huh?)
These shoes I got came from fuckin' Paris, ayy (Fifteen hun'?)
This bitch mad 'cause I don't do marriage (I don't want no marriage)
Let a nigga slide, no, we don't do scary (Skrrt-skrrt, dah)
We tote pistols, no, we don't do worry (Bang-bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang)

I'm a gorilla in a fuckin' coupe, finna pull up to the zoo, nigga (Skrrt, skrrt)
Who, nigga? Who the fuck is you? I don't know, nigga (I don't know)
No, nigga, pull up on your block, we gon' blow, nigga (Bang)
Go, nigga, run, nigga, run from the po', nigga, ayy (Po', woo, woo)
