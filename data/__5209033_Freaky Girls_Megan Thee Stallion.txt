(What Juicy say? He be like, "Shut the fuck up")
(Love it, man)

I'ma be your freak any time or place, any day of the week
Said I'ma let you hit it, I ain't scared, I ain't shy, it's cool with me
I'm lookin' for a thug who ain't scared of the pussy with a gangster lean
If you pull up and a nigga talkin' tough, better freak like me, yeah

Freaky bitch, I do this, suck it like I'm toothless
Your old bitch can't fuck with me, you ain't teachin' me no new shit
Do you know who you dealin' with? Ain't convicted, but killin' shit
Caught a jet just to buy a car, I'm the flyest bitch on the dealership
Long legs, he intimidated, Amazon, I'm elevated
Lil' people make lil' people, stallions breed prize babies
Eat it up for a while, baby, buck on it, I'm wild, baby
I ain't scared, let's take it there, I knew you was a crybaby
Bust that pussy wide, let him adventure inside
If my pussy was a beach, he get swept up by the tide
Any nigga I let hit it, they know Stalli is a vibe
If I wasn't such a player, probably be somebody's wife

I'ma be your freak any time or place, any day of the week
Said I'ma let you hit it, I ain't scared, I ain't shy, it's cool with me
I'm lookin' for a thug who ain't scared of the pussy with a gangster lean
If you pull up and a nigga talkin' tough, better freak like me, yeah

I wouldn't call it mackin', I call it speakin' with passion
I don't call it seducin', I move on it, then I have it
Got sugar for the daddies who truly support my habits
Who buy the double-C's when I'm makin' A's in my classes
Why would I lie and say I wanna be your only one?
Knowin' that I'm young and gettin' to the money, havin' fun
Knowin' who I'm talkin' to, but watchin' him across the room
Knowin' when I'm on the 'yac no tellin' what I'm finna do
A special kind of lady, I'm not easily persuaded
Drive so many niggas crazy, I'm thinkin' Uber should pay me
So sophisticated, still writin' incarcerated
Niggas I was fuckin', when he get out, he gon' bang it, huh

I'ma be your freak any time or place, any day of the week
Said I'ma let you hit it, I ain't scared, I ain't shy, it's cool with me
I'm lookin' for a thug who ain't scared of the pussy with a gangster lean
If you pull up and a nigga talkin' tough, better freak like me, yeah

Freak, freak, freak like me, me, me
Freaky like, freaky like, on it like a freak, like me, yeah, uh
A freak like
Me, yeah
Give me a freak, freaky, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, mmm-mmm, freak, yeah (Love it, man)5Embed
