18 ContributorsBurner on Me Lyrics
I got a clip for a nigga tryna stunt on me
(Stunt on me, stunt on me)
I put a bullet in a nigga tryna front on me
(Front on me, front on me)
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'

So what you got a Benz? I buy my bitch a Benz
Them niggas you be fucking with, I wouldn't fuck with them
I'm on that brick shit, you still on that block shit
I sell them whole ones, you sell ten dollar rocks, bitch
Man, get your weight up, I said get your weight up
Stay in your place 'fore you get your ass sprayed up
Man, I ain't ever scared, I got all kind of guns
I'm getting plenty bread, I throw the hoes to one
Strip, bitch, you heard me? I said strip, bitch
I'm cold as ice, check the temperature on my wrist, trick
I blew three hundred grand, what kind of watch is that?
I bet you wanna know, stop tryna jack my swag, ho
Gucci, Fendi, Prada and that Louis, now I'm hotter
So it's Tom Ford and Armani, YSL, I'm fly as hell
I be Louis Vuitton swan with my hair mask on
I look good enough to eat, your bitches suck me and all fuck me
You might also like
I got a clip for a nigga tryna stunt on me
(Stunt on me, stunt on me)
I put a bullet in a nigga tryna front on me
(Front on me, front on me)
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'

You say you hard as a motherfucker, you goin' H.A.M
We're strapped in this motherfucker, now understand
Banana clip, banana split, I be on some gangsta shit
Dump 30 here, dump 30 there, I make it hot up out this bitch
My diamonds bigger, grimy niggas, city slicker, pull the trigger
Line a nigga, it's a stick up, money pick up, dust kick up
Tires screeching when I'm reaching, 50 preach in church, bitch
This is pimping, fuck around and end up in the worst shit
Hollow tip, .40 mag, bloody rags, toe tag
Body bag, killer swag, blood all on my Gucci shit
Now I'm mad in the Jag, same day, this is bad
Fucking fag, look at your ass, why you make me do this shit?
I'm built for this, so I was told
Since mama gone I've been on my own
I'm for real about it, man, fuck how you feel about it
Nigga, we in the streets, that's why we holdin' heat
I got a clip for a nigga tryna stunt on me
(Stunt on me, stunt on me)
I put a bullet in a nigga tryna front on me
(Front on me, front on me)
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'1Embed
