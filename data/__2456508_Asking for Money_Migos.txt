13 ContributorsAsking for Money Lyrics
I started kicking in doors, just for money (just for the money)
Trap out the bando, just for money (trap out the bando)
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, just for money (stick 'em up)
Young nigga didn't understand nothing but money (give 'em hell!)

When I woke up this morning, yeah, I told myself I had to get some money
(Aye, man, I had this crazy ass dream last night)
I cannot hang with you jabronis 'cause you know that is not making me no money (c'mon, man, you know I can't hang with that broke shit)
I had to cut that bitch off, god damn, all she wanted was some money (you know I hate that gold digging ass bitch)
I can't hang with all my homies 'cause they handout
Asking for some money

I started kicking in doors, just for money
(just for the money)
Trap out the bando (trap), just for money (trap out the bando)
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, just for money (stick 'em up)
Young nigga didn't understand nothing but money (no undo)
Now that I'm up, these hoes so easy to fuck (smash)
They after my bucks, I didn't buy nothing but one pair of Chucks (here)
I'm in the jungle (jungle), I'm from the Nawf (Nawf)
Hit 'em with the chopper (hit 'em), knock a nigga off
They'll do it for the money 'cause they know that I'm the boss
My niggas 'bout it 'bout it ('bout it 'bout it), pull up with missiles and sawed off (sawed off)
We got the green like Boston (Boston), play with the keys like I'm dealing sauce (keys)
Smoking on cookie I'm coughing
You think it's a body, got bricks in a coffin
Heroin black look like coffee (black)
Talking that shit, then we off 'em (off 'em)
Look at yo bitch, look at lil mama stalking
She with me, now you can stop all the calling
Play with the water like I was a Dolphin
Remixing the dope, get a piece of an almond
You want that shit, nigga? Stop stallin'
Free my nigga Offset, so he can get back to ballin'

I had to cut that bitch off, god damn, all she wanted was some money (you know I hate that gold digging ass bitch)
I can't hang with all my homies 'cause they handout
Asking for some money

Niggas be asking for money, they thinking it's funny, I don't give them nothing (nah)
You niggas ain't bucking and no I ain't fronting
You thinking it's sweet banana clip for monkeys
It's 2015 and my double cup muddy
You laughing right now but don't think shit won't get ugly
Turn 'em into bread and peel back his muffin
You finger-fuck light but that give him no budget
I'm smoking on cookie, the cookie jar musty
Treat the blunt like teddy bears and I stuff it
You turn to a cop when you get guap and cuff it (huh?)
Bitches police nowadays, they gon' buss it
Count that back end again, all about the benjamins
I'm a human being so forgive me if I sin
I done been broke before, I ain't going back no more
I done came this far to fall off the pedestal
I done took a walk and walk up to Texaco
Talk to Chico, finessing him for Regano (for Regano)
You boys so crazy, you cannot cop a whole one, you no friend or foe
The monts in my pocket sloppy joe
Christian Louboutin Spikes on my tippy toes
Break the wall like my name is Chris Jericho
Niggas might shoot himself thinkin' he Plaxico
Jump off the top like I'm Eddie Guerrero
My niggas they ride around selling marshmallows
Nowadays niggas call me Marshawn Lynch the way I got the Seahawks flying from Seattle (Marshawn)
Stuck in the Atlantic ocean canoe but a nigga got no pad to paddle
Stay away from the snakes and you can hear them come by the way that they rattle
When I woke up this morning, yeah, I told myself I had to get some money
(Aye, man, I had this crazy ass dream last night)
I cannot hang with you jabronis 'cause you know that is not making me no money (c'mon, man, you know I can't hang with that broke shit)
I had to cut that bitch off, god damn, all she wanted was some money (you know I hate that gold digging ass bitch)
I can't hang with all my homies 'cause they handout
