1 ContributorFeel Good (Mixtape) Lyrics[Intro: Tony Yayo, 50 Cent, & Lloyd Banks)
(YAYO!!) Yeah man, you know, you know like the cars
You know the foreign cars - European cars (Yeah)
The jewellery - you know what I'm sayin (Yeah)
The big homes, we do all this shit for the bitches
When you really think about it man
(Ha-ha-ha-ha!) Even down to the shape-up to the sneakers man
(You know how it goes, money hoes and clothes)
You know my motto though man (It's still M.O.B. though)
(What's your motto?) Listen...

("I'm in love again") I keep sayin', I don't love these hoes
I keep sayin' I don't love these hoes (Man I don't love 'em man)
("I'm in lovе again") I keep sayin', I don't love these hoеs
I keep sayin' I don't love these hoes, but she make me feel ("GOOD")
Ma you make me feel ("GOOD") Miss you make me feel ("GOOD")
Girl you make me feel ("GOOD") Bitch you make me feel ("GOOD")
Ma you make me feel ("GOOD") Miss you make me feel ("GOOD")
Girl you make me feel ("GOOD") Girl you make me feel ("GOOD")

My Cavalli bitch stay in L.A
And my Prada mami live in B.K. (Ha Ha!)
You know my Chloe ho, she hold a fo'-fo'
Buy her a bag, she ride it like a rodeo
I miss my Fendi chick - used to be a Wendy's bitch
I had to supersize her; now she lookin' proper
The price of good pussy ain't always worth it
It can make you insane or get you murdered
And shorty layin' on her back while your blowin' trial
So don't trust a big butt and a smile (Naaah!)
And shorty layin' on her back while you're blowin' trial
So don't trust a big butt and a smile, you heard me? (Ah-uh, Ah-uh)

Special - I'm a special kind of nigga
Look at my life, baby girl; everything's bigger
The stash is bigger; my cash is bigger
Your friend's cute, but you for me - see your ass is bigger
I'm into bigger things; me, I like bigger shit
A nigga stunt in front of me, I buy a bigger whip
The beef pop off, I'm lettin' off a bigger clip
We swallow champagne; them niggas takin' little sips
I fucked a wack bitch; she said I had a little dick
She had a big pussy, real, real big, kid
I buy big cribs; man I fly on big jets
Motherfucker, I am as big as being big gets

("I'm in love again") I keep sayin', I don't love these hoes
I keep sayin' I don't love these hoes (Man I don't love 'em man)
("I'm in love again") I keep sayin', I don't love these hoes
I keep sayin' I don't love these hoes, but she make me feel ("GOOD")
Ma you make me feel ("GOOD") Miss you make me feel ("GOOD")
Girl you make me feel ("GOOD") Bitch you make me feel ("GOOD")
Ma you make me feel ("GOOD") Miss you make me feel ("GOOD")
Girl you make me feel ("GOOD") Girl you make me feel ("GOOD")

They say, "Banks I love you," and I say I love me too
They throwin' it right at me; what the fuck am I 'posed to do?
Return her to a  and a couple are overdue
When I'm done what I do, I'm dumpin' 'her on the crew
And this is e'ryday - won't stop till I'm old and grey
I drop in the M.I.A.; pop when I'm on my stay
Shop, then I'm on my way; first class to the A
I got a show later today; a small paper to play
I'm too grown for rookie shit, too covered to get pussy whipped
Keep a extra bitch around in case you want her pussy licked
That I'll never do; that's inedible
I got somethin' better boo; my pipe game incredible

("I'm in love again") I keep sayin', I don't love these hoes
I keep sayin' I don't love these hoes (Man I don't love 'em man)
("I'm in love again") I keep sayin', I don't love these hoes
I keep sayin' I don't love these hoes, but she make me feel ("GOOD")
Ma you make me feel ("GOOD") Miss you make me feel ("GOOD")
Girl you make me feel ("GOOD") Bitch you make me feel ("GOOD")
Ma you make me feel ("GOOD") Miss you make me feel ("GOOD")
Girl you make me feel ("GOOD") Girl you make me feel ("GOOD")
She calls me daddy, carries my Louis Vutton luggage
Frank Miller's my wrist and she's usin your money
These round-trip flights, dinners at Benihana's
I call in more bitches than Isiah Thomas and she love it
Them other hoes hate her, and plus her head game is better than Fantasia
Shawty I don't love you, I'm just feelin' good
I know I said I'd buy it, did you think I really would?
You know I'm still hood, six o'clock Jack in a Box
With your bitch at the drive-thru, you know how I do
So let's ride boo, we 'gon see
I be Brad Pitt, you be Angelina Jolie, or Jay-Z and B, ha ha!

("I'm in love again") I keep sayin', I don't love these hoes
I keep sayin' I don't love these hoes (Man I don't love 'em man)
("I'm in love again") I keep sayin', I don't love these hoes
I keep sayin' I don't love these hoes, but she make me feel ("GOOD")
Ma you make me feel ("GOOD") Miss you make me feel ("GOOD")
Girl you make me feel ("GOOD") Bitch you make me feel ("GOOD")
Ma you make me feel ("GOOD") Miss you make me feel ("GOOD")
Girl you make me feel ("GOOD") Girl you make me feel ("GOOD")Embed
