24 ContributorsLifter Puller Lyrics
Do you really feel
Honestly, I'm asking you of your heart
I don't even know you!
I know! I'm not asking you what you know of yourself, I'm asking
Oh, yeah, wassup?
What you know of yourself
A-am I the Jezebel? Am I the Jezebel?
The Jezebelly!

You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just

And he was a man, or so he thought
Paid attention to the lessons daddy taught
Secondhand-me-down blessing, she was short on patience
Carried mace and hated everyday people
The plight of the pessimist
Habitual living, daily schedule consisted of:
Work, television and sexual moments
But sometimes it gets so hopeless
When nonsense raises an octave, thoughts block all sensual focus
You might also likeWith a firm grasp on the grudge they both clutch in the name of love
Fear of the results had push ever came to shove
Seduced for fun, produce a lot of fight
Two youths on the run, learning some truth about life
And when he stares at the stars, he reflects on the moon
The time, the talks they share walking around Calhoun
And when she watches the look on his face as he sleeps
She recalls every inch as to how it got this deep
Now how am I to know you like the way I laugh?
I can't read the map, no one's ever seen the path
The one you take a bath with is the same one that frees your path
Oh, you going out? what time you gon' be back?

'Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Let's all take seats, please quiet during the performance
Lift her, pull her from the orchids
'Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Trying to read the script, keep getting trapped in the margins
Lift them, pull them from the gardens
Now she was smart, she grew up with this complex
That the people that surrounded her seemed to expect the world
And he was tall, over six, no attempt to predict the fall
Thought he'd seen it all until his all became that girl
She said she loves the drugs, but when she comes down
She speaks about finishing, she's convinced it's the last visit
He doesn't know the difference between come and go
Give him just one to grow and watch him collapse inside of a half pint
She dyed her hair black, maybe now she can relax
Maybe now the regulars will stare half as hard
He wears a old face and beer gut
Existence validation printed on the monthly statements
That come from MasterCard
He thinks she sleeps too much
She thinks he spends too much
He thinks her friends are jokes
She thinks he's out of touch
He thinks she drinks too much
She thinks he thinks too much
It's all another phase turning the page in the book of growing up
She has seen a lot of sex, he tried to hide his resentment
But there wasn't nothing thing left for them to label new
But sometimes the obvious ain't simple to see
'Cause even the time that they killed
Was something that she wasn't accustomed to
She never comprehended what to make of it (make of it)
He was never quite prepared to study the reaching
Together they shared the sacred practices of breathing
The weather was fair, however the hovering clouds weren't leaving
Discover the little drama demons that hide
Deep inside the framework and live in that congested brain
They had old lovers on the side, old flames
That somehow managed to spark regardless of the pouring rains
And each time they mix up the ingredients
They recheck the recipe to see, maybe they're reading it incorrectly
Collect me, consume me, release me, snuggle
Two geniuses putting together the pieces to a blank puzzle

You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
Every time I chase a squirrel, it rips apart my world
Every time I chase a squirrel, it rips apart my world
Every time I chase a squirrel, it rips apart my world
And every time I chase a squirrel, it rips apart my world

'Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Let's all take seats, please quiet during the performance
Lift her, pull her from the orchids
'Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Trying to read the script, keep getting trapped in the margins
Lift them, pull them from the gardens

'Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Let's all take seats, please quiet during the performance
Lift her, pull her from the orchids
'Cause they were two perfect kids in a too-perfect world
Today the part of man and woman will be played by boy and girl
Your horoscope says that we should share an apartment
Lift them, pull them from the gardens

You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know me, you just love me
You don't know1Embed
