Look, you know I love her tiger (Rrr)
She got the buns, I admire
I'm about to buy that bitch a car, I'm about to send RD the wire (Wait)
You know I love her tiger
I skrrt on her ass like a tire, huh
She like, "Papi, you on fire," huh
She like, "Papi, you on fire," woo
.44 barkin', ayy, hold on, louder than a church choir, huh
I do a drill in a suit, huh, then I change my attire
Look, she throw that ass back in a quick sec'
Change her clothes and then make a Snapchat
Then she go talk about it on her Facebook
I'm like, "Baby, I thought we was past that"You might also like3Embed
