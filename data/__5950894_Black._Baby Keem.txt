God got me pullin' out these whips you can't afford
I know God got me cruisin' with a bitch you can adore
I know God got me livin' with no feelings, that's of course
I know God got me acting like the villain, that's of course
Aye

Yeah, enough of the fuck shit
I been 'bout that action
I been pushin' luggage
One million, I touch it
Take flight with the bag now
Don't put on a front with me
I dash to the cash now
She ain't want fuck with me
She left me all cold and shit
She hoping I fold and shit
Like, how did I cope with it?
She fuckin' with niggas from other cities
The whole time, I'm tellin' her I'm that nigga
I bust up, I feel just like I'm P Diddy
Fuck with me, K-Dot come pull the trigger
Labеls and they are not fuckin' with me
Rеmember when they wasn't fuckin' with me
Say Keem gon' kill this shit
I been for real and shit
I been in school and I can't even feel this shit
I cannot finish it
I gotta finish it
My mama hate me and I cannot deal with it
I been sleep lately, but now I'm up in this bitch
My hair get nappy, and no, I'm not pickin' it
You niggas vultures and no, I'm not feelin' it
I'ma go drown in some pussy and live with it
I'ma say fuck it and live like a kid again
I'ma say fuck it and die by my innocence
Can't stand lil baby except when we fuckin'
It's fuckin' amazing
Said she don't see me
She just want Mercedes
My old bitch ain't love me
Tried trap me for babies
What?

Aye
God got me pullin' out these whips you can't afford
