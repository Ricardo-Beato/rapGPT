17 ContributorsRevolution Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The revolution will be televised
The revolution
Just Blaze
Oh-oh-oh-oh
This is serious business
Dududududu

The revolution, oh, oh
(Yes)
Will be televised, will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)

Sitting back watching, but I'm so unstable
I been an OG since I was rockin' in the cradle
Y'all don't know that my bite is so fatal
Kick a fool down like the homie with the 8-0
Ayy though, nigga don't play though
With the 'K though, like the spray though
Sculpted left hand full of clay dough
Split him in the middle cut him up like a potato
Oh, leave 'em on the sideline, bleeding cause he tried mine
We loot 'til the boot out
Me and my brother, we was caught up in a shootout
Had to handle, pigs on a nigga, four days
Eight laws of power, eighty-five ways
TEC-9's with a couple 45's
And the revolution will be televised
You might also like
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)

This ain't the local pass cash with the bra fast views
This shit will be viewed on your broadcast news
Why did I do it? My momma is on the call
Shot three lil pigs and now my back against the wall
Nowhere to turn and nowhere to go
My blood is burnin' I'm about to blow
Huey, Malcolm and Martin, those are my peers
They been doin' niggas like this for over hundreds of years
Poppin' us, fear, now it's time for us to clap back
But this time we gon' bust, step the fuck back
We ain't runnin', we shootin' and lookin' forward
Anybody, somebody, everybody on the floor
They just surrounded my place
Hold the court in the streets so I can win my case
TEC-9's with a couple 45's
And the revolution will be televised
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)

The revolution-lution-lution-lution
The revolution-lution-lution-lution
Will be televised
Oh, oh, oh, oh
The revolution-lution-lution-lution
Oh, la-la-la-la-da-da-da

The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)
The revolution, oh, oh, na, na, na, na, na
Will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)1Embed
