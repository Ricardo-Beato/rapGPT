21 ContributorsZOMBIE$ Lyrics
Coke in the lip, gettin' head in the whip (TMZ) (Oh lord)
No average (Uh), bad bitch, ass thick (Yeah)
Fat tits, she a dime (Uh), fuckin' with a dime, dollar bill
State of mind, TMZ, fuck enemies, I skateboard with Zombies
My niggas blow good (Carti), got them palm trees on the palm trees (Yeah)
When the shark speak, I'm a showboat (Ok)
On a jet ski rockin' SBs (Uh), rockin' Tommy
Fendi belt (Steeze), where the 9 be
Blowin' hella smoke, where your soul go?
Where your spirit at? (Bitch)
Gettin' cash bitch (Bitch), I gotta have shit (Bitch)
I got cheetah print on my Pumas
My lungs black, my brain pink (Uh)
Swisher guts, leave evidence
That I've bent over and fucked your bitch (Fuck Her)
I'm an asshole, I might take your ho (Fuck her)
So don't bring your ho in my presence (Fuck her)
Graveyard my residence (Carti)
Zombie broads give me neck and shit
Pulled off with the top off (Skrt)
Let the smoke clear (Clear) (TMZ)
Cartier in here (Here)
I got a bitch in a different place (Carti)
Cold weather, North Face
All black, Cartier yeah (Yeah)
I do what I can, I'm the fuckin' man
Man, ask your bitch, she a fuckin' fan (Yeah)You might also like1Embed
