I did a show and got back to the trap
I ran off the road and got back to the trap
(x3)
I did a show and got back to the trap (x2)
I did a show and got back to the trap
I ran off the road and got back to the trap
(x3)
I did a show and got back to the trap (x2)

Quavo
When I do a show I get back to the trap
I might do a show and almost stay with the strap
The plug got the pack, I gotta go snatch it
Then I fuck on that nat-nat, I love my hoe ratchet
Look at my wrist fantastic
Doing the magic like I play basket
I drop it off with accuracy, I go pick it up at Aspen
My niggas down the road stabbing
And Skippa Da Flippa, we having
Papparazis still flashin', police harassing, when I ride past 'em
Trap niggas know what's happenin'
Came into Atlanta from Athens
You niggas drinking molasses
You think that it's Ac and I'm laughing
My plug he Asian like Enter the Dragon
I bought a beamer and paint it black satin
Most of you niggas be rapping, really be acting, god damn it's tragic
You might also like
I did a show and got back to the trap
I ran off the road and got back to the trap
(x3)
I did a show and got back to the trap (x2)
I did a show and got back to the trap
I ran off the road and got back to the trap
(x3)
I did a show and got back to the trap (x2)3Embed
