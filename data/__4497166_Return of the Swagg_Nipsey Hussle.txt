Bounce (Bounce)
Bounce (Bounce)
Hussle (Hussle)
It's Nip Hussle in the house (In the house)
It's real playa shit like (Like)
Hussle music (Hussle music)
It's All Money In, no money out (No money out)

Girl, why you think it's a hole in your mouth?
Don't try to flip the question, I don't go down south
When I could show you the bounce
Show you how to flip that ounce
Tuck it in your purse and cover your blouse
Setup shop, bring the work up in your house
Really show you what this hustlin' about
That's if you game for it
You in the club, what you came for?
To meet a baller with a car and get all your drinks paid for?
You and your girlfriends with the french tips and the MAC lipstick
With the black Baby Phat fit
Knowin' that your ass and tits is enough to have most niggas blind 'bout the cash they spent (Yeah)
But not Nipsey, you can't knock Nip's hustle
Convince you I love until I got a limp muscle
Why flip ruffles until my chips double?
Let's hit the sunset strip and get  in some trouble, come on
You might also like
We could take the Benz and hit the street (Yeah)
With the top down so they could see (Yahp, yahp)
We could hit the clubs and party hard (What up?)
'Cause I just bought out the bar (Hussle)

Return of the swag (Hussle) (Yeah)
Return of the swag (Hussle) (Yeah)
Return of the swag (Hussle) (Slauson)
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back (Here I am)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back (Here I am)

As soon as I stepped in, it's nothin' fresh so don't test 'em
The four-five under the five , it's a heckler
The S500'll hit Slauson from zero to sixty in six seconds, quit flexin'
Plus mami in the rear's interested
Tongue ring probably mean head's in the question
Bad gal, open toes, all around sexy
Invited to the session in the VIP section
So come chill with some real bosses
My money come in lumps and I get it often
I came from havin' nothin' so I gotta floss it
And all this kush weed got me so exhausted
I pop bottles with broads that's full throttle
I could take your picture if you're tryna model
We could take a trip to the top of Colorado
Or ride shotgun through the neighborhood that I know
We could take the Benz and hit the street (Yeah)
With the top down so they could see (Yahp, yahp)
We could hit the clubs and party hard (What up?)
'Cause I just bought out the bar (Hussle)

Return of the swag (Hussle) (Yeah)
Return of the swag (Hussle) (Yeah)
Return of the swag (Hussle) (Slauson)
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back (Here I am)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back (Here I am)

Come ride with me
We could hop inside my old school that's on fours
Who's fly as me?
My diamond's shinin' and my pocket's swole
She's eyein' me
And now I'm tryna get her outta those
Designer jeans
'Cause that's what I do
That's what I do-do-do (Hussle)
We could take the Benz and hit the street (Yeah)
With the top down so they could see (Yahp, yahp)
We could hit the clubs and party hard (What up?)
'Cause I just bought out the bar (Hussle)

Return of the swag (Hussle) (Yeah)
Return of the swag (Hussle) (Yeah)
Return of the swag (Hussle) (Slauson)
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back (Here I am)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back (Here I am)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
Return of the swag (Hussle)
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back (Here I am)Embed
