12 ContributorsOn Top Lyrics
Rollin off them hittas, sippin on that lean
 Lamron shorty, all the bitches one way
We posted on the block, come through we let off shots
When I be through with getting that top, I be ready for that gwop
Touchdown, we on top
 put me on top
Tell my bitch I want top
Don't play, bodies get dropped
Understand we on top
 put me on top
Tell my bitch, I want top
Don't play, bodies get dropped

I be on my grind, boy, boy im on my grizzind
You ain't got mine, then somebody dizziying
Higher than a bitch, man it feel like I'm flizzying
And I'm Coolin in the trap, tryna get rid of
Glory boy bitch, 061 and Indiana
And I'm posted on the block, yeah I'm flexin with them hammers
Name rings bells, bitch Fredo Santana
Fuck around with me, man them killers they be at ya
Reese hat it do, and I'm tryna get my bands up
 and these niggas tryna handcuff
Just fucked her face, fuck it, let my man's fuck
The bitch don't wanna fuck with me, I tell that bitch she mean nothing
You might also like
Rollin off them hittas, sippin on that lean
 Lamron shorty, all the bitches one way
We posted on the block, come through we let off shots
When I be through with getting that top, I be ready for that gwop
Touchdown, we on top

Tell my bitch I want top
Don't play, bodies get dropped
Understand we on top

Tell my bitch, I want top
Don't play, bodies get dropped

I am not the same, no, who the fuck are you?
 niggas got it, so I got the coupe
Timbs on, so I dare a bitch to think it's nice
Blood in my ass, hood living in my life
Real shit, I'm a real ass bitch
Got a lotta enemies, I'm pretty, getting rich
Shawty I'm getting payed, I swear there's no way
These niggas stopping me,  blocking me
Money is all I see, cause bitch we share the streets
I keep war, cause these haters tryna bury me
A young bad bitch,  tatted up, swag on
Real niggas kill niggas with the Trues on
Rollin off them hittas, sippin on that lean
 Lamron shorty, all the bitches one way
We posted on the block, come through we let off shots
When I be through with getting that top, I be ready for that gwop
Touchdown, we on top
 put me on top
Tell my bitch I want top
Don't play, bodies get dropped
Understand we on top

Tell my bitch, I want top
Don't play, bodies get dropped

Money bitch I'm hot, ain't shit sweet you'll get dropped
From a bitch I want top, everybody off them yops
Couple hittas loading them Glocks, so please don't get shot
Glory Boys we on top, either ride or get flocked
61st, thats they block, so that mean that's our block
OTF fuck the opps, drop a 4 off in my pop
Body slow like I'm off yops
Sliding them thotties to our block
 put me on top, all my niggas shooting them chops
Tatted up 
Everybody playing they part, broski nem coming up hot
Shooting dice coming up hard
Broski nem cracking them cards
Catching stains going on lames, it's all in the game
Rollin off them hittas, sippin on that lean
 Lamron shorty, all the bitches one way
We posted on the block, come through we let off shots
When I be through with getting that top, I be ready for that gwop
Touchdown, we on top
 put me on top
Tell my bitch I want top
Don't play, bodies get dropped
Understand we on top
 put me on top
Tell my bitch, I want top
Don't play, bodies get droppedEmbed
