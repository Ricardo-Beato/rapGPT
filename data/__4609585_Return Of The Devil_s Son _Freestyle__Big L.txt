Throw that shit on, ooh-ooh
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus (Uh, uh)
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus (Uh, uh)
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns (Yeah, yeah)
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus (Yeah uh, uh, uh)
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus (Check it out now, and check it out now)
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus (And turn the mic up)
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus (Yo, ooh-ooh)
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
Wait, rewind it back
I like how that went down
Rewind that shit one more time, fuck that, let's go, one more time
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns (Uh)
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus (Uh, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus (Uh)
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus (I'll explain the story, check it out)
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns

Ayo, 5/3-0/7-4
A little bro was born with the mind of a psycho
They first knew I was a crazy nigga
When my mother came home and found out I killed the
Baby-sitter
I did more crime in due time
Started my life of crime
About nine going out for mine
I made every little kid from my hood run
I was just like that little bastard from The Good Son
And my mind was past bummed
Dropped the blow-dryer in the water while my moms was in the
Bathtub
Then I just saluted as she electrocuted
They got booted, 'cause that's another I executed
I was a child runnin' wild like a goose chase
Punish my dad, I put poison in his toothpaste
Then I pick my aunt or sister up, gave her a quick spank
Then dropped the little bitch in a fish tank
I invited company, murdered the four guests
Put a cap in each whore chest and ate their raw flesh
I tell the truth I ain't lyin' man (When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus)
And right now I got my cousin Brian' hand in a fryin' pan (When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus)
