19 ContributorsMirror Lyrics
I'm 'bout my check, Nike Air (Air)
I am so unfair (Fair)
I think you need a chair (Chair)
Waiting on me to fail (Fail)
You say you seen some money (Money)
Nigga, tell me where (Where)
Is it over there? (There)
Or is it in here? (Here)
I'm going overseas (Seas), I'm so used to Navy Pier (Pier)
My car from overseas (Seas), at the light, bitches stare (Stare)
But I don't really care (Care)
Hop out, look at my gear (Gear)
I see Almighty Sosa (Sosa) as I look in the mirror (The mirror)

I get money, bitch, I'm serious (Serious)
Riding fast, my car so fierce (Fierce)
My car, bet my cops so furious (Furious)
My car bad like a lil' kid (Kid)
I beat my bitches like my kids (Kids)
I treat these niggas like my kids (Like my kids)
Your inquires serious and I'm so serious (So serious)
Know I'm riding and I'm so feared
And I'm so weird
'Member posted on the block (Block)
Selling D to every motherfucking club (Club) that I see (I see)
I be pulling up in the 'Rari ('Rari), felon-ney-neyy
Walking up in the clubs (Clubs), they're with me-me
Walking up in them stores (Store) buying everything I see (I see)
In the jewelry store, get my diamonds tested (Tested), everything icy (Icy)
Then I take a look up at ya, everything sheisty (Sheisty)
The Balenciagas super big, man, everything Nike (Nike)
You might also like
I'm 'bout my check, Nike Air (Air)
I am so unfair
I think you need a chair (Chair)
Waiting on me to fail (Waiting on me to fail)
You say you seen some money (Money)
Nigga, tell me where (Nigga, tell me where)
Is it over there? (There)
Or is it in here? (Or is it in here?)
I'm going overseas (Seas), I'm so used to Navy Pier (Used to Navy Pier)
My car from overseas (Seas), at the light, bitches stare (Bitches stare)
But I don't really care (Care)
Hop out, look at my gear (Gear)
I see Almighty Sosa (Sosa) as I look in the mirror (The mirror)

Take a look up in the mirror, I see me (I see me)
I don't wanna be nobody, I be me (Bitch, I be me)
Who your bitch going to see, nigga? Prolly me (Prolly me)
And she Spanish so you know she papi me (Papi me)
Can't come to the mansion, told her lobby me (Told her lobby me)
Then we walk up in there told her Harley me (Told her Harley me)
And then when we finish you know I be clean (You know I be clean)
Out the door, in my car, riding mean (Riding mean)
She was on top of me and topping me (And topping me)
I was counting money in the money machine (In the money machine)
Don't give a fuck if you a train, ain't no stopping me (Ain't no stopping me)
And I ain't gon be on time, so ain't no clocking me (Ain't no clocking me)

And baby, that money flowing let me wifey (Let me wifey)
All you can do is suck and Skype me (And Skype)

Waiting on me to fail (Waiting on me to fail)
You say you seen some money (Money)

But I don't really care (Care)
Hop out, look at my gear (Gear)
