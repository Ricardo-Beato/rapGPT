9 ContributorsI Need My Money Lyrics
You new niggas funny, you'll get jumped like a bungee
For all of that money, where is my money?
You niggas is honey, you can't get none from me
I need my money, I need my money
I know you have it so where is my money?
I need my money, who got my money?
Fiendin' like junkies for all 'em blue hundreds
I need all my money, I need all my money
I know you got it so where is my money?
I need my money, who got my money?
Fiendin' like junkies for all 'em blue hundreds
I need my money, who got my money?
Who got my money?

No paper, no convo, you'll get folded like tacos
For that money, I need my money
Don't think this shit funny, you niggas sweeter than honey
I need my money, nigga where is my money?You might also like1Embed
