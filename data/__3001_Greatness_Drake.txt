23 ContributorsGreatness LyricsUh, I am a distraction
Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in
If cash is beautiful, then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin’ centerfold of Maxim
Open to my page and admire my desire
Frequent flyer, I aspire to retire
My voice stands alone even if I’m with the choir
Got a cannon on my hip, but nigga, this is not Mariah
Na, this the record killer for hire
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require
Look I created, despite the niggas that hated
Every single bar gettin' first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin' so sedated
The me and bitch the same, we feel so related
Forest Hill estated, all dinners catered
I put a thousand on it, I could probably fuck the waitress
So, wait, just take this
Oone lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit
Drop a four in it and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga

I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
It’s more about where you are
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up
I’m at the label in the elevator, send 'em up!You might also like4Embed
