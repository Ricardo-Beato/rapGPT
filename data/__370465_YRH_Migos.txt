42 ContributorsYRH Lyrics
Chasing the cheese macaroni
Keep the pocket rocket on me
Hell naw we don't fuck with no phonies
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell broke nigga we some young rich homies

Okay, now all my niggas violent, all my niggas violent
We ain't even sign no deal yet, me and Migos we mobbin'
I'm like all my niggas violent, all my niggas violent
No Master P but we 'bout it
Say all my niggas violent

No Master P but I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Tell your bitch we the young rich homies
Better slow your roll jabroni
Run up on the block they shoot somethin'
Walking around with that that Tommy gun
Young niggas in the hood love the molly Santan
When they pop it, they'll chew it like some bubble gum
Can't fuck with the plug, that nigga be taxin'
So I had to make a mission like the famous Jett Jackson
Got all these pocket rockets on my body
Lookin like a young nigga got go go gadgets
Look at your bitch and she ratchet
Still beat the pot up like Cassius
Make the work disappear like magic
Hit the plug in China town, order up another package
You might also like
Okay, now all my niggas violent, all my niggas violent
We ain't even sign no deal yet, me and Migos we mobbin'
I'm like all my niggas violent, all my niggas violent
No Master P but we 'bout it
Say all my niggas violent

Chasing the cheese macaroni
Keep the pocket rocket on me
Hell naw we don't fuck with no phonies
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell broke nigga we some young rich homies

Okay, now all my niggas violent, all my niggas violent
We ain't even sign no deal yet, me and Migos we mobbin'
I'm like all my niggas violent, all my niggas violent
No Master P but we 'bout it
Say all my niggas violent

Young, rich and we ruthless
Wipe me down, no Boosie
Blue diamonds, no Tookie
I got J's, nigga, like Pookie
I'm cookin' whipping them dueces
Steven Spielberg, make movies
You smoking on that boatweed and we smoking on them cookies
Woke up in a mansion, but I went to sleep in them trenches
Started off in them Honda Accords now Im riding in them Bentleys
Your bitch fuck with a young nigga, I'm dunking her like Timothy
Them bullets just like Ritalin, make a nigga calm down instantly
Ask your mama, ask your bitch
I grab the fork and I cook up a brick
I grab the pint and I pour up six (I’m pouring it)
Actavis, I don’t do Qualitest (Lean)
Lettuce and cabbage and broccoli (Cash)
I’m cooking up catfish, tilapia (Fishes), and I got flounders
Got yo bitch fucking on camera (Smash)
Hell nah we don’t fuck wit no phonies
And you can tell yo bitch we some young rich homies (Your bitch)
Just left my jeweler, so much ice on my neck got pneumonia
Guisepppe stepper, Christian Lubuiton’s, and Maison Margiela
(The stove hot the block hot middle of the summer wearing leather)

Chasing the cheese macaroni
Keep the pocket rocket on me
Hell naw we don't fuck with no phonies
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell broke nigga we some young rich homies

Okay, nw all my niggas violent, all my niggas violent
We ain't even sign no deal yet, me and Migos we mobbin'
I'm like all my niggas violent, all my niggas violent
No Master P but we 'bout it
Say all my niggas violent56Embed
