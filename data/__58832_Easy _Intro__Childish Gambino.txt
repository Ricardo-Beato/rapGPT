34 ContributorsEasy (Intro) Lyrics
Sick boys don't die, they fresh to death
My shoes bright blue, so you watch my step
My hoody hot pink with the hat to match
So you ain't gotta know where my paper at
Pop tags cause I'm filthy, apes can bathe me
My home is the dirty but I shine like crazy
My hat tag up and it hang off slightly
My game 8-bit so you niggas can bite me
Nike like me cause my life is great
I'm married to the game, we should consummate
Brand new hoodies the color of light sabers
My name ain't Luke, but that dude date Leias
With fly ass sneakers
Bump them speakers
Pump this groove 'til your ear start bleedin'
White girls shake it 'til the black dudes notice
Black girls shake it so you can regain focus

Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out

Let's get one thing straight, I'm no average rapper
Born in SoCal, then I hit Atlanta
Then to New York, I'm an army brat
And I learn new things all across the map
In Cali, I was small taught need to be strong
And Atlanta had the hawk so I learned how to ball
New York had Starks on the New York Knicks
So when they came around I had my first round pick
And now I'm so sick that they call me Ebola
Sick girls all on my pole like totem
Life is a gamble, your boy done told 'em
Play your cards right like it's Texas hold 'em
Bounce dem shoulders, go ahead Bankhead
I can do it better even though I'm Stone Mountain
Georgia's on my mind, but I live in New York
So I got a Southern drawl and I limp when I walk
They used to say a nigga lame when I started to rap
Now them fake fuck niggas askin' me for a track
Pokin' me on Facebook tryna be my friend
Nigga, you get your face took you ask me one more 'gain
I'm a G that's why call the shit Gmail man
This is my space nigga, you can't make top ten

Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out2Embed
