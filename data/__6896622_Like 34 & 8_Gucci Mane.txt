(Mike WiLL— Mike WiLL Made-It)

We strapped up like the Taliban, my hood something like Afghanistan
And I just put some cheese on his head like a Packers fan (Well, damn)
Shiesty, that's my Kobe Bryant, ain't no way I'm trading the man (Shiesty)
Don't try me or my goons be at your house like they the cable man (Wow)
They say I'm a sex symbol, they say I'm a ladies man (Huh?)
Dressed up in the latest fashion, fashion show with Dapper Dan (It's Gucci)
It look like I robbed a bank, so much bread, it make you faint
We be еverywhere you ain't, I go еverywhere you can't (Go)
I send shots at where you think, I get millions when I blink
I got birds like Arthur Blank, I just bought a purple mink
Cooking cocaine in the sink (Skrrt), seen some shit that make you drink (Drink)
Doing time, it make you think, got you clutching on your shank
He said he gon' rob who? (Who?) That's like trying to rob a tank (Woah)
That's some shit that get you spanked (Woah), they done had too much to drink (Well, damn)
You just trying to get some rank, spill your blood out like it's paint
Say you with it, but you ain't, not a sinner, you a saint (Wop)
I'ma make it plain and simple, send bullets at your pimples and temple (Pew, pew)
You deep in that water and you don't know what you into (No)
Gunners on their way, why you saying what you fin' to? (Huh?)
We gon' make you sprint when we pull up in them rentals (Go)
They just left a dent, he can't run from what I sent him (No)
Niggas jumping clique, they don't even want to befriend you (Well, damn)
Niggas come to kill you and they didn't come to end you (Grrah)
Nowhere to retreat, now you screaming, "I surrender" (Quit)
Niggas ain't riding for you, don't want to revenge you (Sad)
Thought you was a lion, could've swore you was a ninja (Could've swore you was a)
Heaven or Hell, can't decide where I'ma send you (Ayy, let's go, let's go)
T-shirt with your face is the way they gon' remember (Ayy)

Big Blrrrd, blrrrd, ayy, big blrrrd
I'll make your favorite robber give it up
I'm just chilling with your BM, she said she wish it wasn't two of us
Having threesomes at the gym, bad bitches galore, letting me line up
All the opps seek for attention right after they go and hide from us
In a couple months, went platinum, yup
Next two years, might go diamond, huh
All-black booty Draco with the wood, can't name a bitch fine as her
Lil' baby ashed on my diamonds, wide-body full of zaza
And gotta be braver than a Arab, he thinking 'bout coming trying us
I told Wop he could drop me, he catch me outside with my chains tucked
I heard both niggas that dissed me in they songs got they ass flamed up
And they better not say shit after this, I'ma come through and finish 'em
My folk them tryna catch them, they cross they thumb and stick four fingers up
I knew I ain't get the headshot, but the fuck you mean I grazed 'em? Huh?
Swear the Lord had to be with that baby-ass lil' boy that day, He saved 'em, yup
I'm King Slime, rock you to sleep, then I put a snake in your cradle
I'll come get you 'fore you clap me, Shiesty put shit in the newspaper
Blrrrd, blrrrd, Big Blrrrd, the newspaper, yeah
Every day a new hater, yeah, every day a new opp
I got new drops on they block, goddamn, why all my members locked?
Ayy, Big 13 don't give out passes, F-O-X, no Jamie Foxx
Every day, new high speed chase, ran through state troopers and the narcs
Won't ever pull over, no way, it's a gold box behind my Glock
Blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd
Ho was talking 'bout send her a jet, sent back a one-way flight with Spirit
Yeah, I be rapping, but still'll get in the backseat without no jewelry
Lay in your yard, creep like a spy, move where you can't see or can't hear me
I said ain't no running from that fire, know I'm coming, them niggas fear me, blrrrd, blrrrd
Ayy, two Dracs on the lap, four glizzies, one MAC
In the CTS5-V four deep, push up right now, everybody getting whacked
Throw the lob up to Wop like Kobe and Shaq
Word around town, they be taking your sack
Ayy, F&N choppers and Glocks when I move, don't come around with them jamming-ass ProMags
Ayy, pour up a pint, I ain't letting it last
Fuck champagne, but I might drink it out the glass
Fuck champagne, but I might drink it out the glass1Embed
