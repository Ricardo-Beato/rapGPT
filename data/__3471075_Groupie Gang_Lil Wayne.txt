Y'all know what this is
Tunechi Gang
Pump, what's up?

Lean made me swerve in the cruising lane (swerve)
Your money funny like Pootie Tang
Had to leave Cash Money, had to do my thing (swerve)
New password, new username (yahh)
My new teams loves having newer things (yahh)
One phone call and my jeweler came
I bought you and you and you and you and you a chain (brrp)
Daddy got bust at the gun range (tah!)
My drugs cost more than your mortgage (mortgage)
The hoes gon' throw 'em out regardless (regardless)
I'ma throw the hoes another party
Nigga, I ain't got hoes, I got an audience, damn
Every week fashion week, runway (runway)
Fly the bitch overseas, one way (one way)
The bitch come around here and go both ways
Made her eat so much pussy, need a lunch break, damn
She don't even hable inglés (inglés)
Got the booty with the thighs and a shrunk waist (damn)
And right between her thighs is an entreé (damn)
And she know I'ma need more than one plate, yeah
And I look up in the sky through my sun shades (yeah)
Lookin' in the eyes of a sun ray
I ask it "Can I shine," it say "All day"
Made the sign of the cross over the heart ray, amen
Boom, bang, red beam, blue flame (blue flame)
Tunechi got clique like Hussein (Hussein)
Stick got kick like Liu Kang
My bitch got tits and two chains
Damn, I'm tied to the track of a money train (money train)
You blind to the fact, that's a fuckin' shame (fuckin' shame)
I still countin' bread with the butter stains (ooh)
Got the world on my back, you got puppet strings, yeah
You might also like
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang

Yo' bitch fucked 'til the Uber came
My clique love sipping Houston drank
Yeah, that's purple, magenta, and fuchsia, man (yah)
My bitch love watching Boomerang (yah)
My kids love watching Stranger Things
It's guerilla warfare, y'all orangutans (ooh)
She gon' hit the cocaine like a hurricane (yah)
It gon' make her do a whole lot of other things (yah)
It gon' make her takeoff then jump off of the plane
Make her race racecars in the lovin' lane, pyong!
Make her drop the top, feel the summer rain
Make her pussy come again, tell these pussies "Come again"
Fuck her hard fuck her soft, she want love and pain
She gon' have to walk it off or do the running man (pyong!)
Nigga, fuck the game, fuck the game, fuck the game (fuck the game)
What they think it's wonderland? Think it's fun and games (nah)
These funny ass niggas think they Martin Payne
Try to walk it like you talk it, never walk again (ayy!)
Hundred thousand flat in a rubber band
But I could get you whacked for some pocket change (brrt)
And my niggas snap like the paparazzi gang (brrat)
And you know they say a picture say a thousand things (brrt)
She wanna be with me and feel alive again
She wanna join the gang but she gotta train
I never knew her name, still forgot her name
Thots shall never ever thot again
I flew her to Columbia, her body changed (pssh!)
She came back home with the model frame
Now all the hoes wanna know her doctor name
All these hoes looking for a power change, brrt
Damn, who that is? Him? Not again (not again)
He don't get the picture 'til it's out the frame (out the frame)
Nigga washed up like a box of Gain (box of Gain)
He don't get the scripture 'til the choir sang
Amen, Tunechi mane, Tunechi mane, mula gang (mula gang)
Lit like Superman running through the veins
Street smart, nigga, I could be a tutor mane
My shooters aim at your motherfucking pupil, mane, bang
Talk stupid, it's your block, we gon' be loopin', mane (skrt!)
My gang stay away from the trooper gang
Spit flame like my name King Koopa, mane
But if the pussy sweet, you can call me Sugar Shane, ayy
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang

Your bitch out of my groupie gang
Can't blame her, I give you to blame
Eat xan bars like Nutrigain
Coochi better smell like sushi mane
Another pain pill, that'll sooth the pain
Tunechi mane, Tunchi mane, mula gang
Groupie gang, groupie gang
Groupie gang, groupie gang
Your bitch out of my groupie gang
Your bitch fucked 'til the Uber came
My bitch love to do hookah mane
My black barbies got booty fame (damn)
My white barbies got Hooters fame (damn)
I'm a eye doctor that you should blame (yeah)
When she tell you she don't wanna see you again (yuh)
The lean made me swerve in the crusing lane (swerve)
Your money funny like Pootie Tang (ha)
Had to leave Cash Money, had to do my thing (swerve)
New password, new username, ayy

Thots shall never ever thot again
Thots shall never ever thot again
Thots shall never ever thot again
Thots shall never ever thot again2Embed
