29 ContributorsNo Fucks Given Lyrics
Yo, you ever had a homie you did everything for?
But when it comes down to helping you, they barely support?
When you around them you feel like you stuck with various chores
They dead weight, but you love 'em too much to bury their corpse
So you keep 'em around, hoping that the sun gon' shine
Ain't no harm and I'mma give this nigga one more try
And then they screw you again and you like, fuck no, why?
And that's the second you know that you gotta cut those ties
Man they been taking advantage of you, aiming they madness at you
You can't even tell 'em, they unable to handle the truth
They full of shit, you gotta spend days scrambling through
Telling me you sorry, I'm like uh uh, that isn't new
That's when you gotta turn your back and put your foot down
If you put up with it, you gon' get put out, nigga don't you wuss out
See I've been boxing with this issue for some good rounds
My circle is smaller, come take a look 'round, I'm good now

If you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Oooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me
Never gave a fuck about me, oh no
I said if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you

You ever dated a woman that held you back?
She ain't making no moves, you like, yo where the hell you at?
Life is valuable girl, I shouldn't have to tell you that
Cause you grew up with some bums who knew nothing but selling crack
She'll tell you that she'll do better and convince you
You move her in with you to fix the issues, you assuming it's gonna be simple
But shit didn't change, now there's something deadlier emerging
And her situation just became a heavier burden
Now your life is more than crazy, you fighting on the daily
Man it's time for her to go, you done decided, no debating
Cause there ain't no light shining on the future
She wasted all my time and all my mula
And she ain't even grateful for the cheddar I blew
Eff it, I'm through, bitch, I'm no longer messing with you
You ain't nothing but good for nothing, that's what evidence proves
And now you're just another topic when I step in the booth, bitch

If you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Oooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me
Never gave a fuck about me, oh no
I said if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you
See life's just a crazy cycle
What repeats itself, I know
As I grow, I learn from all the mistakes I made
Shit, I'm better on my own
You've got a lot of niggas around and they'll cut you
It's important that you learn to say fuck you
Yeah, they never gave a fuck about me, oh, na, na, na
This is the last laugh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Man I don't get involved with these phonies no more
I just open the door, and kick 'em all out, I don't keep 'em close
Been through this shit too much, you don't even know
Damn, you used to be the trophy of my life, but now that trophy is broke
And now you're wondering why I don't text back or call you
I deleted you out of my phone, bitch, who are you?
Pay attention close, I hope I come clear
Bitch, if you looking for a fuck, you won't find one here

Cause if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Oooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me
Never gave a fuck about me, oh no
I said if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you
I got no more fucks to spare
I got no more fucks to spare
Nigga what is the purpose?
What is the purpose?
It is not worth it
I got no more fucks to spare
I got no more fucks to spare
Nigga what is the purpose?
What is the purpose?
It is not worth it
I got no more fucks to spare (things coulda been so cool with us)
I got no more fucks to spare (so cool with us)
Nigga what is the purpose?
What is the purpose?
It is not worth it
I got no more fucks to spare (things coulda been so cool with us)
I got no more fucks to spare (so cool with us)
Nigga what is the purpose?
What is the purpose?
It is not worth it

If you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Oooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me
Never gave a fuck about me, oh no
I said if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you9Embed
