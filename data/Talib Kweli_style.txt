And you feel like you gon' explode, youknow'msayin? (uh-huh)
This right here is for, all y'all to know that
I know what y'all goin through man (yeah, yeah)
I feel it myself (yeah, yeah I do)
I could relate, yeah turn this one up
Sometimes life make you wanna attack and go off G
You wanna step back and I let it roll off me
Brooklyn, New York B, ain't nothin soft G
Yeah I get stressed but I let it roll off me
Flirtin with the fame but I let it roll off me
They love it when I'm losin but I let it roll off me
Dirt on my name but I let it roll off me
Always keep it movin and I let it roll off me
Do it for my niggas with letters, let's set it off B
Cops don't protect us, protestors just get ignored B
Played out like musical theater with best support
The investors and bankers havin sex in expensive orgies
I'm rappin on the corners like Abbey, Abdul and Common
Born when they was robbin the grave at Tutankhamun
Way before Bush the USA been bombin
Cause whether ratchets or needles know the shootin ain't stoppin
Niggas lootin, we ain't coppin a thing
And if I'm locked in the bing, a nigga not gonna sing
I got a lot of things on my mind, dollar signs, life on the line
What I write's so right for the time
The revelation like sight for the blind like when God cypher divine
Hand you lessons; or when you in the church havin confession
Or when you kneelin on the pew, catchin the Holy Ghost
Or the cult, so fanatic they think suicide's the only hope (no)
They used to ask you "Who ya master?" Now they ask you "Who your pastor?"
It's your allegiance that they truly after
They used to ask you "Who ya master?" Now they ask you "Who your pastor?"
It's your allegiance that they truly after

But I step back and I let it roll off me
Brooklyn, New York B, ain't nothin soft G
Yeah I get stressed but I let it roll off me
Talk the talk but to walk the walk is costly
Niggas got on they +Game+ face like Black Wall Street
Every single move I make is ballsy
Cause the shit it used to be a, silent movie now it's a talky
The Feds cheesin like Milwaukee when shit is Brew-in
When these niggas stage a coup for the president I'm a shoo-in
But, ain't no political aspirations I'm persuin
I hate to ruin your dream but music is what I'm doin
I've touched more people in a verse than you do in 20 speeches
Whether state's blue like the water or redder than white people on sunny beaches
Sometimes I don't be understandin it
They looked at me and said that's why you the perfect candidate
Standin at the pulpit with a full clip
What I say real talk, turn around and walk away with your bullshit
I'm like breed, yo I ain't to be fucked with
Only write the realest, can't lie to the public
The sharp wick cut quick, killin 'em softly
They try to take me there but you could never force me
Brooklyn, New York B, ain't nothin soft G
Yeah I get stressed but I let it roll off me
Flirtin with the fame but I let it roll off me
They love it when I'm losin but I let it roll off me
Dirt on my name but I let it roll off me
Always keep it movin and I let it roll off me

What is this?
Welcome to the Prisoner of Conscious

Brainiac dum-dum, bust the scientifical
You feel it all up in your soul, we getting spiritual
You heard I'm coming back, it's so scary I put the fear in you
I murder every track, cause the rhymers like to stare at you
Real shit back, it's a miracle
Rap been laughable over the last year or two
Reflecting like a mirror through who is the real living proof
I'm back with the classical shit, I pack lyrical
Substance like bowls of kush into a vaporizer
And then I vaporize ya', my paper may surprise ya'
No need to brag on my paper cause I'm a naturizer
I vibrate higher, the truth break liars
I chose who is like us
The lovers, the fighters, the writers, the exciters
Cut the grass we could see the vipers
We cut the glass cause we the diamonds

Kweli the artist that you wanna be
Moving the through darkness, the light is what's in front of me

Wait a second, got your girl wetter than tomato flesh
Waiting on me with baited breath

Vintage, nothing but the sky is my ascendant
My girl is ride or die, I'm avoiding the evil temptress
Ain't no question who the best is
You don't like it stay the fuck out of my mentions
Pimping down to the socks, and so is business
The all night workout like 24-Hour Fitness
Y'all niggas is adorable, incorrigible
The praise that you get is barely audible
People is ignoring you, why?
The last place in the world that you belong is a recording booth
Order suit, niggas is gassed up
Petroleum a lab when these niggas get swept up
Custodians of culture, back to the future rap, DeLorean
I class up the joint the spit is valedictorian1Embed

Give them your real eye, we rock on and on
You keep yo' heels high, keep it real tight
Who gettin real high? We rock on and on

Cut checks like cuticles, bust tecs at funerals
My sound freak you out like rough sex in the studio
I blow the back out the track when I black out
Got the spot maxed out, people in the front pass out
Security carry that ass out
Get in the zone when I'm stoned like I live in a glass house
Last bout I was in started to get real serious
Homeboy got dropped and spazzed out like mysterious
The boy in the hood with the furious style
We in the age of Aquarius now, yo

Niggas wanna blaze a hammer

Every party we come through makin the "Gun Music"
Practice the (Art of War), don't make me Sun Tzu it
I put them knots in yo' head 'til you can't undo it

And made these bitch ass niggas take they make-up off

Everybody say (HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!)

Lames just, stay in your lane, the flow is HazMat

Yeah, we back for the '07, say goodbye to this '06 shit
Yeah we here for the championship
And that's exactly what we came to get
You know the name of this, organization that made you famous
It's the Strong Arm, with the long arm to throw the bomb on
The drop of the dime; we at the top of the line
Plus we on the incline, the rhymes be finer than wine
Design them in the mind, they shine like diamonds
Fresh out the coal mine, young soul, old mind
I'ma hold mine, Steady spittin cold lines
Sharpen it up, backwoods sparkin it up
These niggas act like, what I rap like in the clutch
I mastered the dutch, Dizzle tell 'em to duck
Hitman for hire, Blacksmith put it up
Courtesy of Kweli, you got a problem with me

The walk and talk soft could cost your head
The difference you the minor we the major
No long life to be lived for the hater or the traitor
Eight out of nine of my niggas doin time for advancin
Handlin illegal finances
This the family reunion, mixed with the holy communion
You'll never win, you're too busy consumin
Kweli, let's start up a union
Protect the real niggas from the fakes so we ain't gotta do 'em

And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Why you so far away? You need to feel this
I've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick
I've done dirt in the past, I know that love hurts
I'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first
I can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues
You get excited, ignite it, highly combustible
You on a higher vibration, that's why I fuck with you
Left me provide for you, comfortable as a Huxtable
Your whole style is colder than Minnesota
I love your profile, the way you look over shoulders
At the crib, I'm hopin' you come over
We can do it like Common and Mary and come closer
We can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump
Black magical, act radical with the fist up
Do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop
Promise you I'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked

Like a Spike Lee movie, I'm movin' across the floor
Feelin' love in the music, I'm using it like a lure
I love how you do, with your beauty and your allure
Make you come like the ocean, approaching me like "sure"
She Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby
As valuable as The Scream or a Salvador Dali
She popular with the thieves and wanna be Thomas Crown
Some try to steal her attention as soon as I'm not around
This last bird probably flew the coop
Blastin' Outkast, last words: "Ooh-Dee-Whoo"
I don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful
Je ne sais quoi... how you say, "voulez vous?"
Pardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither
'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her
I'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor
But fix my composition and give a proposition to consider
I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl

Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me

Black Madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer
While I manage, just serving long sentences, no commas
Write poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna
The promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter
You the Earth, that's emphatically "yes"
But I still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect
Naturally blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh
I ain't gotta ask her "why you stare" - that's a "yes"
I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl

Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel

I wish I could talk to Lauryn
I mean excuse me, Ms. Hill
And let her know how much we love her is real
The industry was beating her up
Then those demons started eating her up
She need a savior that'll bleed in a cup, yup
We used to kick it in the salad days
When she look at me like she ain't know me when she see me nowadays
I nod, she nod back, that's how it stay
Her songs still better than anything out than "Hot" or "Power" play
Remember how they accused her of saying, he did her album without help
Then she went to Rome to sing and tell the Pope about herself
Just after she left the Fugees, started rolling with the Marleys
Got back with her crew at Dave Chapelle's Block Party
She made songs about Zion and trying to be faithful
Took Black Star on tour in Europe, I was so grateful
Speaking for myself but I'm sure I could speak for Dante
I got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte
We used to chill at Nkiru, her moms was a customer
She used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler
Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren
What the album did for black girls' self-esteem was so important
I got concerned when she got sick on the road
She ain't healthy, I'm a brother
And I wish that I could pick up the load, but no

Got your assistant on the the phone, "I need to talk to Lauryn"
And I wanna walk through the storm, and I could be the umbrella when the rain is pouring
Please, this no disrespect to whoever your man is, though
This relationship is strictly music like D'Angelo
I know you hate Babylon, and wanna see it fall
But they won't let you read your poem at the BET awards
You give us hope, you give us faith, you the one
They don't like what you got to say
But still they beg you to come, whoa
Now that's powerful sis, it's black power
We get money, keep our eyes on the final hour
And no I ain't saying you Christ, that would be sacrilegious right?
But you can blow and you nice, sisters them raps is vicious
The raps the sisters recite with their black fist up
The devil's last wish is a queen that rise past bitches
We used to read Francis Crest or anything
By Third World Press impressed
But what the power of the word suggest
Hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest
You gave birth to a new sound like Donda West, yes
Should I be saying all of this while the mic is on?
I might as well let it out because one day I might be gone
I write this song and hope you feel how much we love you
And you play it, cause I really ain't got the words to say it

Ask anybody that you bump into
Who got it poppin when it come to these rhymes (who got it?)
We got the sound that you jump into
You automatically pressin rewind (jump up!)

They call him Kwe' for short, really talk to the children
But too many people feel him and they might, try to kill him
Try to test me I survive, like your grandma recipe
(Survive) like a Child with a Destiny
Survive like a Cuban holdin piece of wood floatin to Miami
Like, Elian Gonzalez cause they back with the family
Survivin in the streets of Brooklyn, that's where you find me
Survivin like somebody mommy clutchin a palm tree in a tsunami
Who woulda thunk that would ever happen?
Rootin for Kweli cause he brung back clever rappin
Sister - heads wrapped in fabric of the standard music
Chicks - with their tits, made of plastic look, dancin to it
In this arena I balance, your boy stand alone
And win it cause these rappers is more annoying than camera phones
Maybe it's me, it could be hard to move me
But these niggas got me trippin like a white girl in a horror movie!

Drop it heavy then get in the wind like a weather vane
Let it rain, let it pour, metaphor so let it off
Like the 38th special edition of "Set it Off"
Yo the trap, got you blastin your heat
It's hot ones like shotguns from the passenger seat
The mic booth, the district where they be packin the meat
Cause they kept it raw as the jump off, I hop, back on the beat
Back on the street like an ex-con
With enough in his pocket for a tip at a restaurant
It's a cold world, dress warm
Cuttin through the bullshit record labels and the shady deals
Ladies feel the beat when they out clubbin like baby seals
Let me chill out cause the raw image to focus on
Get back to my point, this joint is jumpin like a circus song
Yeah, to break it down to the basic components
They don't want it so I'm runnin out of worthy opponents, whoa


Even when I be sleepin my brain it keep goin deep inside
A street poem with rhymes that keep blowin your mind
With a unique flow and heat showin
Grown men weepin in the open, tears leak into the ocean
Today is (Training Day), I passed the test like Ethan Hawk and
I'm droppin signs like Craig G, or Stephen Hawkins
Y'all don't rhyme, y'all speak in quotes of MC's that sleep in coffins
Latchin on like a leech and eatin off 'em, you weak and soft and


Jump, jump, jump - Brooklyn jump up
Jump, jump, jump - Harlem jump up

Moving at the speed of a solution
Bleeding in the streets as we're breathing the pollution
They're saying that we need a revolution
But their passion is reduced to all-caps on a computer
Hey, every sixteen I make a sick scene
Blood splattered all on you shirt like a Miskeen
Y'all niggas trippin' like mescaline and mixed greens
My flow cleaner than the Sistine, pristine
You going green like Al Gore with 'em
I make algorithms that got Malcolm in 'em
God's favorite, I'm sick as a doctor's patient
We live in a cold world, my job is to rock nations
My occupation? Elation, a celebration of rebels
Raise the levels and the decibels flagrant
It's too amazing how we be blazing, son
Our flowers is the loudest, they crowd around us
But cower in the shadows of the towers, boy

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off

While I'm inflicting the pain and making it suitable for any occasion

Quickly back you up and bag your bitch
She's reminding me of Sanaa Lathan
Rely on the hating while I'm smiling and waiting
That's when I embrace 'em
If you try to front, you'll be highly mistaken
The mightiest making of a classic, alrighty, I'll face it
My psyche is ancient and I'm hiring, so try me, I'm patient
Sorry, I'm lying, face it, I'm back for the taking
I'm urgently giving niggas the courtesy of smashing their face in
(Damn, can you cut his mic off?)
See how we got 'em buggin'
Cause they can't believe what we have in the making
Shit so historic, got me goin' for it while I bang the nation
And do niggas greasier than a slab of bacon

Bitch, you still cooking this pork in this house?
Stop cooking that damn pork in this house
The hell going on in here?
Take a tour with it, bake the raw

That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off

These rap niggas is bitches, nothing but suckers to me
Sacrifice myself for the music and let them suffer through me
Your weak product is nothing to me
I only feel effects when I fuck with Louis
Yep, I get buck in the studio like I'm Evil Dee
Pulling strings like the Muppet movie
Shining my light like Mos calling his mother Umi
Who's the hottest regardless of who's flaming?
We ain't talkin' 'bout the best until you mention my name
Who're you kidding? The truest spitting
I'll break you like a mirror so it's clearer
That we don't believe in superstition
These new additions need supervision
Thinking that they can spit it in the booth like me
What are you stupid? Listen
I've been official, it's been official, I'm too consistent
I make a claim cause I'm too official for euphemisms
Staying in the cut like a new incision
I'll put you on your ass like True Religion
So give it up for the truest living
Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off

I seen 'em crossing a bridge by the masses,
Covered in the ashes of both towers
Native New Yorker the way that we talk
Make him an offer that you can't refuse
Come back later on after you thought it over
Look out for shooters that we’re popping up at the opera
To pop ya, daughters paying for the sins of the god father
Popular music got ‘em confusing killers and artists
I kill it the hardest. Competition dearly departed
They feeling some sort of way 'cuz my flow revealing the garbage
I'm making 'em throw it up. You just making the people vomit
When it comes to this rhymin' I’m a legend like Tutankhamun,
Or the Chupacabra, the way I weave it together and tie the knot up
Made a macramé of macabre, you daquiri with a shot of
The Amarretta, you’re sweet as a girly drink
Throw it back, cognac, I'm the best, you know that
You can have your own opinion, but not your own facts
On track as the most prolific ever, the most consistently
Viciously off the rip, we be rippin' it like a shredder
Some symphony hall shit, gettin' higher than your falsetto,
Getting better. Drop a pearl every jam like Eddie Vedder
Very fed up with self appointed preservers of past eras
Who never see their reflection when they’re walking past mirrors
They got bitten and now they smitten with the taste of blood
They take enough drugs for the sleepin' they weepin' and fuckin' they make-up up
I raise the bar and the waiters up
All this hate is just confused unadulterated love
The eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up
Advocate for artists, regardless cause I got faith in us
For the workers who don’t get paid enough
Take the bus, hands way too rough for the paper cuts
As far as they’re concerned food on the table's the only way to love
It takes a slum village to raise a child, you got to raise it up

And I'm talking over this def beat right here
I think we should turn it up
We got my man (Tr-tr-Trend on the beat)

Thinking of the master plan
Where there’s nothing but cash inside my hand
Wanna dig into my pocket my prophet is heaven sent
I dig deeper, you know I represent, represent
Yeah, money over bitches, my sisters go over everything
My bandz will make you dance, I'm forever like a wedding ring
Far above the hate and, the jealousy that the cheddar bring
Trying to get away from the 85ers like Evelyn
Ride with me, I got ‘em leaking like Nene
Got ‘em leaking like Wiki, these monkeys biting like hickeys
Cause they’re seeing what I’m doing, filling them with confusion
Cutting just like a truant, I’m fluent just like a student
Of the romance languages, only the diamonds hang with us
My meal is decorated with garnishes just like your wages is
The crib’s outrageous like really it's no joke
The girl of your dreams be coming over to smoke loud
You might also like
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people

You can feel the heat from your speaker, my sound will darken your features
Run it down like a zebra, I move with the speed of cheetahs
I’m from Brooklyn where the heat is the size of a two-litre
I ain’t asking for no followers, I'm looking for new leaders
Is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us
Intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus
Been hard since I started reading, alliteration is literally littered
Through my DNA swimming all through my semen
So every time I bust, babies begin being born
Talk turns tough til them toasters that's tucked get
Drawn like a picture, picture a perfect painting
Police profiling people peacefully praying
Lay the law like leaders the lazy is lollygagging
On my grind getting guap, guess green is the new black
Meet me at the bar, we throwing a few back
Hopped out the car, you know who blew that loud

Ayo we drink good, smoke good
These cats wearing funny hats like the pope would
I come in looking quite clean in the loafers
So hood might scheme up to no good
You no crook, Gosling in the Notebook
I got the birds on the wire like I know I Wood
I still rep P.O.C.s like I'm supposed to
Coming live from death row like I know Suge
My rhymes like a laser beam - so focused
I’m in the ring, so lean I need a foam cup
I ain't lying, bare teeth so ferocious
Maybe I’m lying bare feet in the ocean
On the beach fall asleep and I'm floating
To the beat so unique like a potion
I love music, I’m complete in my devotion
(Word, say it again)
I’m complete in my devotion

This the high life
Call it my life

This is the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove, what's good, my people I think we could
Get it you know we should, hold it like it’s a grudge submerged
But I just surf

I’m renting the universe
But the stars don’t fit and my bars are too mega
Is the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker

Moon raker, sun scraper, will give you fire for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Sire of the flavor, designer of the caper
Executive executor direct when I'm on path
Flight without navigator, plight of a savior

Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? You don’t believe in you
The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable
Vizzini in the princess bride - inconthievable
These MCs is eatable, wait - edible
I’m fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due

Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate

We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate
You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they don’t one quote and the hate just integrates

They feel us like shade, you know we’re feeling great
Not a script that is writ', this is how originals spit
It's an unconventional gift, kwe we interpolate
Them others be herbin' it, the praise, we deserving it

Word, I love songs, writing to right wrongs
Continue to fight on, I’m putting the gloves on
I love horns, I'm loving this damn track
I’m loving the hand clap, it's the clap, clap
Loving it when you listen
"Love will fix it" said Ashford and Simpson (That's right)
Living for the drums and the slums, some of the best parts
The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark
Yeah, so in my idle space, they're funny like them bridal maids
Booking like we’re playing spades, yeah, we always make the grade
FSC to get a fade, Valencia then to the Haight
Sucka free I’m in my space, say I’m hella steezy, yeah (yee)
Believe I get a so in, streaking like a Martin
Sunny in Dolores, bike parking
Fly chick's sparking
Then we up the road to the Phoenix some steady bar hopping
There's high life everywhere, Tony Allen rhythm is
Pattern that we living in, Kweli on his business
Everywhere we deep in this, shawty’s gon' be speaking it
Oh, they so uniquely spit

The great debater, the saviour, the caped crusader
The alpha, the omega, your favorite communicator
News junky I’m debunking the myth of the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty, I’m bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie, they're spinning it like a sufi
Rappers, I dissect 'em, collecting 'em like a souvie
Near they’re acting up I'm directing 'em like a movie
Skip the drama, this an action-adventure
They so freaking soft it should be against the law
Illegal tender
And yo, do I really need to mention
This is the high life
High life, high life
High life, high life
Cause we be living the high life, high life
High life, high life
Yes, I’m living in the high life, high life
High life, high life
Cause I’m living the high life, high life2Embed
I switch lanes; it's still blurry, then switch frames
Clowning these lames -- you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Braggin' about the ride that you're whipping, your soul is missing
Racing to your death or the holiest celebration
God bless our lady of holy acceleration
Cuz we speeding while we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I’m staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, cause we got the same brain
We in the same chains, work in the same fields
Now we’re independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I'm blowing past the procrastinators
So fast, it's like they going backwards
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door

Half these little boys coming faster than speed racer
Pulling capers with my team best believe I’ll be seeing paper
With extraordinary gentlemen, trust me the league major
On the highway of life I’m faster than cop cars
Quicker than the tongues of the rappers that got bars
Never rattled cause we been through the battles, we got scars
This the international half of the Black Star
This is the sound that you’re missing I’m here when your ears listen
Play it loud in your whip when you're dippin your gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick.
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain’t screaming
Just whisper in their ear and we're leavin

I gotta win to the fire
You can’t stop it. No, you can’t stop it
Because I’m destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it’s happening
At the time, get ready, set, go
(Verse)
On your mark, get set, when I start the jet
Look how far I get, I’m not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don’t exist, it’s a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market’s flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It’s so ironic, it’s beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don’t get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you’re tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That’s why I’m leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it’s all about the winning, it’s never about the wait

Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops

Yea, yea, hold it now

I gotta buzz like I’m Georgia Tech
They still cheering like I’m all that’s left
The air is toxic when you draw your breath
Resurrect the music I’m snatching it from the claws of death
The vital signs are improving I make em lay down
An idle mind is usually described as the devil’s playground
My rep established I’m rapping just for the sport of it
Been nice for a career you just barely grasping the thought of it
Indebted to the hood like a Rush card
Supported like push up bras and lumbar
Except I’m never sitting I’m ever living like Mumm-
Ra I’m the sun god
Smart as a whip, but forever ripping it dumb hard
I see you fronting with them dollar store shades on
Faker than abs that’s sprayed, artificial as rayon
My rhyming satisfying your Quest For Fire like Rae Dawn
Chong, when I’m forming like Voltron
I’m young Raekwon
Mixed with a bit of KRS-ONE and Q-tip
Rakim, some of that Ice Cube, now who’s this?
No one as gifted as this, so magnificent
Classically consistent, I’m nasty as black licorice
The coldest but I get the room hotter than bikram yoga

Follow em when they tweeting, holler instead of speaking
Give it a name, she played the wicked games every weekend
Broke up with a dude for almost ending her life
Came over for the closure, ended up spending the night
Got cozy in this apartment, wine bottles started popping
Put scratches up on his back, they questioning where he got them
Forgot it was her, she Freddy, her fingers was like machetes
The fucking was so steady, she shredded him like confetti
Confronted him 'bout every single chick, shes like "enough already,"
I need to be with someone else, this stuff is so petty
She was reacting to things he did in the past
This nigga was no saint, he couldn’t say no to ass
Her behavior so rash, she gave up all her power
He put her out on the street, nowhere to live, nowhere to shower
How she gonna make it through the night?
How she's so accepting of her station in life?

How she running the streets but still standing still?
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel

Battery in the back, popping up with the coppertop
Popular with the ass of the Hottentot
Niggas whooping and hollering at Andromeda when she passing the barber shop
Only job that's an option McDonalds or telemarketer
Hard for her making ends come together, this ain't the Beatles
She needing some anesthesia like she going under needles
She doing so much cutting, its a wonder she bleeding
The money was so seductive, no wonder she ain't leaving
First time she felt like a woman was when a dude screamed
"Nice ass!" out the car window driving past
Nobody showed her how to live so all she do is dream
They call her Rocky cause her makeup is like a mask
 scars permanently lodged on her frontal lobe
Behind bars for credit card schemes she pulled a month ago
First she getting high, now we waving bye-bye
She's waiting out her station just the same
As she's waiting at the station late at night for a train that never came

My girl is a delicate flower, a super-hero
Being a single mom helped develop her powers
We stay up to a elegant hour talking inhaling the sour
Reaching out to God cause the Devil a coward
But he still sits on my shoulder and whispers
It feels like my shoulder gets colder the more that I listen
And now it seems like she ready to leave
We stay to beef the main reason my desire to spreading my seed
I try to tell her I'm just a man
She said "no, you're wrong
Cause you're way more than that
You need to cut the scam
You're not fooling me, this lunacy
Them excuses might be new to the birds
But they ain't new to me."
Yo, I hate when the fit is thrown
It's like everytime I pick up the phone you bitch and moan, whoa
I'm like why you stressing for?
I'm pressing ignore, make me wanna never get involved

I need to reap these benefits
Ooh, you so sensitive

Cause we acting out the stereotypes like Tyler Perry movies
My indiscretion is reeking in deep betrayal
Libidos are like horses, it's hard to keep em stable
She believed me the way Mike believed in Fredo
But I need her, she the proof in my soul, my sweet potato
Before I let her go I know she'll be forever gone
I can't leave when the weather wrong I weather storms
She like Katrina got me looking for FEMA
Coveting my neighbor's lawn the grass is looking greener
But in reality it never is
I'm sure there's others, but I'll never find a better fish

It's a brand new day
If you passionate about what you do like I'm passionate about this music
This song is for you
It's like I can't breathe
When I wake up in the morning I can't breathe
Until I listen
Feed my family
I affect the world
And y'all along for the ride

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams
Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stone
Until my partner died and name etched in stone
My daughter's growing up, my son on the way
They closing in on me, it feel like any day
Music saves me, swooped in like the navy
Put a lifetime of scars all in sixteen bars
So I took the vow and made music my life
Yep, I proposed and made music my wife
And if ever need to cut a nigga music's my knife
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dyke
So if I degrade it and I hate it, even cried through it
I watch brothers prophesize about dying through it
Music gave me knowledge of self, and I'm a knowledge-ous self
Then gave me knowledge of wealth

Music a part of me, I'm a bully
Beating up the track with brutal honesty
The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me
I'm using the inspiration Guru provided me
The redefining of space, you can call me the new geometry
A picture of you pop up when I google monotony
Now all the people who rule and spend responsibly
Think your album is trash and it's not the voodoo economy
So you expecting the conscious and introspective views
Eat your lyrical vegetables, let me tell you what’s best for you
My music give you a message true and respect is due
But music is emotion that’s lost on the intellectuals
A tree fall in the forest is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robins and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create is sacred
It cost you nothing but I pay to make it, trust me

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over

I'm like Robert Johnson
When you reach the crossroads
Me and the devil have to meet
I saw the same thing as Clef and Lauryn, when they saw it
Lauryn went looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin'
We listen to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade of death like we got a fear of living
Having a seance on stage cause the spirit risen
Stop the devilish ways with clever displays of lyricism
These songs are a natural resources of actual street stories
Attract the police forces
Slaves to the rhythm the masters they eat off us1Embed

Aqui agora para cantar para você, para balançar
Se voce quiser, pode chegar, pode dancar
Ohhhhhhhh

Last night I had a dream that was so real
I woke up in a cold sweat, it felt so ill
I stared into the face of an angel
Tainted by the city, you ain't from this place it'll change you
Walkin by, I thought I was sly
Offered to try, at first I thought she was shy
'Til I saw this guy at the bar talkin to her reckless
She ignored him, cast a glance in my direction, started dancin to my section
... Her body flyer than a jet pilot
What a smile and the eyes like wet violets
They flutter by like the wings of the butterfly
Keep it tight, Eva Mendes in The Other Guys
Got me in another zone - they call her Sunshine like
"Put your mother on the phone, I ain't comin home"
Put a deposit on a place in her heart
All along she a place from the start
My favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love

Brasil o povo de mistura raca pé no chão
Objectividade na vontade de crescer

A feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
Yet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic
Vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
My adversaries speak I'll of my name, I'm so sick
Attack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp
Everything fall into place, it's gravitational
Profit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable
Healthy relationship make your other ones better
I'm Lee Scratch Perry, they call me the upsetter
For the cheddar get the bread up
Mr. International call it the bruschetta, the spiritual newsletter
I wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
You're lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part
From a boss in my prime, look how we crossin the finish line
How you tired, I stay wired like I was offered a line

Uh, uh
I don't wanna bang it or beat it, hit it or stab it
You're listenin to voodoo, I call it the black magic
You jammin up the traffic, you bubble, it don't stop
It might blow up but it won't go pop
"Pow!" That's the sound like onomatopoeia
Got me floatin when you (Rockin My Boat) like you Aaliyah
Got them African features like people out in Bahia
Mix tobacco with the reefer like you was a European
When I leave I'm gonna miss you, (Official) like Kardinal
Trust I'll come back and I'll visit for carni-val
When I come back around, take me out on the town
And you can show me how you put it down

Man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I, man I fell in love

Yeah, you know it’s real, but I’m focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you’re not in tune, no, you’re not immune
No Echinacea, no golden seal
So you sick inside, gotta flush it down
When you talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain’t nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you’re out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you’re gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That clock only thing you punchin' out
I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you’re made to do
I got faith in you, you’re gonna make it through
Cause you don’t chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a baby due
You won’t taste no fruits like Naked Juice
Wo!! The world won't wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vow
As long as you on planet earth put family first got to make 'em proud

Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don’t stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain’t living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanksgiving
People of colour 25% more likely than whites to face prison
But just because the president is black there’s no more racism?
Post-racial? More like most racial
The hate for you disgraceful
Don’t let it take you off your base, let it motivate you
Don’t let it overtake you, so what another cloud
Survive the storm by riding on the beasts of the southern wild

I hit these emcees with the grip of death like I was a Vulcan
Ain't a lot of "ifs" and "ands", it's just straight talkin'
It's hard to swallow at times, so take portions
Bitin' off more than you can chew create orphans
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Rappers is spittin' nails into they own coffins (C'mon)

I black and blue emcees actin' new to me, get smacked stupidly
They lack skills, like the Black community lack unity (Uh)
Still my rhymes hurt like Ali to Fraiz'
Step off the stage to shouts of "Kweli, boom-ai-yay!"

See, these four emcees came to get down
Rearrange the rap game, change your whole sound
Nigga, you gotta understand the plot to
Movin' and groovin' and always improvin' a lot to
I'll outfox the average Porsche Boxster talk
Break the bank on some old Frank Sinatra (New York)
Slash Chi-Town, slash Philly
Check the blast from Geneva, you can get slapped silly

Guerrilla Monsoon rap, all the shorties like "Who that?"
Got the whole crowd like, "How ya do that?"

And ya crew give me dap like "true that"
We come through and all the shorties like, "Who that?"
Got the whole crowd like, "How ya do that?"
Nigga, you get smacked 'til ya blue-black
And ya crew give me dap like "true that"
Okay, my sound drenches each of the five senses
And hold the shock value of electrified fences
It's truth or consequences, ride with us or against us
Is you a dedicated soldier, or you a princess, dog?
I'm in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf (Ha)
Nann nigga competition, gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission, hittin' Pharoahe for help

From natives walkin' the Trail of Tears to players sippin' Belvedere
We always comin' well-prepared and all my dogs smellin' fear
Plus, even my niggas from the Bay, they say you hella scared (Uh)

Words of the four, the rawness that'll restore your calmness

Guerrilla Monsoon rap, all the shorties like "Who that?"
Got the whole crowd like, "How ya do that?"

This is my life, my life, my life, my life
Yo, what's the daily word?
You ever feel like giving everything up
And buying a boat so you can sail the world?
Aiyyo, what's really hood?
He got a gift with the lyrics
The beat is lifting your spirit when you ain't feeling good
Sometimes he feel like the whole world is turning on him
The people miserable and try to place they burdens on him
He revealing the truth like he a portal
A vampire sucked his blood, now he immortal
First he ignored then he worked the applause
He thirsty for more cause they loving how he perfectly flawed
Most of these rappers softer than the allure of Juicy Couture
And from the start he put his heart in every verse he record
Caused to perform for the corporation, he made a profit with Satan
Then got with the Beat Konducta for his Liberation
And for free at last till everybody started selling it
But him, he's like I need to see a piece of that
And get right with God, he knows his gift is a phenomenon
He catch it when it strike like a lightning rod
His rhymes are the spitting image he created us in
We getting paid in wages of sin
True, it's like death in a room
Every lie we ingest and consume
Is guaranteed to make us vegetables soon
Sometimes it's so hard, can't go on
Where did he lose his focus, where did he go wrong?
He should love his life, he got a loving wife at home
But still find himself roaming through the club at night
Kiss his children and they hug him tight
Gotta prove his love in family court tomorrow
'Cause he and they mother fight
These other artists really don't know what to make of him
So they afraid if him, they ain't breaking him
It's been over ten years since he gave you the blast
The ones that counted him out, they didn't do the math
The fans tell him he under-appreciated
Underrated and hated but he thankful they debated
Thankful that he made it to glory while some faded
Thankful that he keep it surreal while some fake it
Thankful for the skills that's keeping the family stable
Thankful for the meals he put on the family table
He pay the bills when he able and spend for pleasure when he can
This the true measure of a man
Some things he'll never understand, that's okay though
He know we're molded in the image of God like Play Doh
But still he wax philosophical like Aristotle
Maybe one day they'll come up with a better model
But till then, he the best there is
More than ten-thousand hours in
So that make him the specialist
Oh yeah, it's way more than relevance
It's classic, original, you remember thisYou might also likeEmbed

Please, hold your applause 'til the end
We are glad to come and hear you speak
We love it
Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this
But one time we were drivin'
Through the Mississippi Delta
And there was a brotha runnin' up the side of the road
And he didn't have any shoes on, he didn't have a shirt on
And I started to drive right by this man; Kweli said
"Stop the car, because that brotha might be in trouble"
And I stopped the car, Kweli said to the man
He said, "Brotha, are you okay? Do you need a ride somewhere?"
And the man looked at Kweli and said, "Shhhh, I'm escaping"
And Kweli took him by the hand and said, "My brotha
You didn't get the memo, we have been free for some time now"
Well, I'm windin' it up

Step out on the block to face the sun
Greet the people in the village that raised my son
As far as days go this look like an amazing one
I feel more normal in the summer the same as the Yankees won
It's like of course, what you expect less
The night about to kick off, folks is out in their best dress
Pimps and whores rising on the horizon
Ballers coppin more diamonds
Watch the ferrion looking towards Zion
What's embedded in the hardest head
It's the epic lie to me and debt to a
Country that gives us no credit
So cats stealin money cash hoes 'cause
That's what's expected
What's the bill when the original architect is kinetic
Mummies return, so dummies can learn
Just how much Hollywood got to burn
Of our money that's hard-earned
But that really ain't my concern
As I walk the block
When the sun goes down it starts to get hot

Magnetic like refrigerator poetry
Attract imimators who wanna flow like me
You know it's me, floating free
Through the ghetto were the people supposedly
Ain't trying to show no love openly
Give me your hand (yeah)
Trying to build a bridge so we can stay the course
Hi-Tek lay the track for the train of thought to run across
Come across places were faces got tracks of tears
'cause the human race been runnin up on they backs for years
Yeah, but they don't break
They keep it movin like when I travel the land
And peep how other people do it
How other people go through it
I'm bridging the gap like the Black Eyed Peas
I'm lovin givin it back, to see them raise up
I'm living for that
To keep trying means you keep failing
But if you don't keep trying
That means you keep dying
What the hell, we gonna die anyway
Keep your soul live when you're here

To get by.. just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you eagles spread rumors
We survivalists, turned to consumers
To get by.. just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Me and Willa raised three daughters all by herself, with no help
I think about a struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words, melt in my mouth
They hot, like the jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Core bailed me out
To get by.. just to get by

Its easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stay drunk
Yo, I activism - attackin the system, the blacks and latins in prison
Numbers of prison they victim black in the vision
Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to
I let them know we missin you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The TV got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin to rely on, we get high on all types of drug
When, all you really need is love
To get by.. just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon, "Imagine all the people watch"
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop

Just to stop smoking, and stop drinking

Clowning these lames you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Brag it about the ride you're whipping, your soul is missing
Race it till your death to your holly celebration
God bless a lady if only accelerate you
Cause we're speeding when we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I'm staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, cause we got the same brain
We in the same change, work in the same fields
Now we're independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I low it past the procrastinators
Well fast, is bound to going backwards
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I'll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
They hate when I get it straight and they chase us
Have the little boys coming fast to the speed race
Pulling cables with my team best believe I'mma see paper
With extraordinary gena, trust me to lead lay you
Highway of life faster than a car
Rick it in the trunks of the rappers that got balls
Never rat out cause we lived through the battles, we got scars
Mr. international, half of the Black Star
It's the sound that you're missing I'm here with your air glisten
Play it loud at your wind when you're gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain't screaming
Just whisper and then we're leaving
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose

When it's gone to the wire
I gotta win to the fire
You can't stop it
No, you can't stop it
Because I'm destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it's happening
At the time, get ready, set, go
On your mark, get set, when I thought the jet
Look how far I get, I'm not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don't exist, it's a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market's flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It's so ironic, it's beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don't get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you're tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That's why I'm leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it's all about the winning, it's never about the wait
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I'll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road

Will carry it forth till the day I die
They just know the name they don't know the pain, Black girl

I do it for the people, I do it for the love
I do it for the poet, I do it for the thug
This is for victory, and this is for the slaughter
I do it for my mother, I do it for my daughter
Promise I'll always love ya, I love to kiss and hug ya
You and your brother should be looking out for one another
I'm so blessed, man, y'all the reason I got up
Somebody put his hands on you I'm getting locked up

And if I die then she'll be protected by Amani
That's her bigger brother and I love the way he love her
She a girly-girl, she love to imitate her mother
But she a Gemini, so stay on her friendly side
She'll put that look on you, it's like somebody friend just died
My pretty Black princess smell sweet like that incense
That you buy at the bookstore supporting Black business
Teach her what black is; the fact is her parents are thorough
She four reading Cornrows by Camille Yarborough
I keep her hair braided, bought her a black Barbie
I keep her mind free; she ain't no black zombie
This is for Aisha, this is for Kashera
This is for Khadijah, scared to look up in the mirror
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a Black girl name, she living Black girl pain

The pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions

Fist raised, caramel shining, in all our glory

So I take what I want like a coup d'état

Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition

So I gotta tell the truth, that's a smart decision
Capitalism is a cataclysm
If white collar crime is a bad decision
Then the makers who routinely crash the system
Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison
Need money to eat, need money to live
Need money to keep, need money to give
But when pursuit of the money is your only goal
Then you lose control, then you lose your soul

Love is a potion that's fluent, let's keep it movin'
The only thing that's magic is moments, I'm only human
The only thing that's tragic is futures that we can ruin
I pound for couple of hours, double influence

Beyoncé married Jigga but they think we all jiggaboos
Don't get confused by the lyric
Protector of my city, stand alone on the citadel
Wake up in the mornin', say a prayer cause I'm livin' well
Proof of a miracle, it's spiritual
These niggas go from robbin' punchlines, to bein punchlines
For lunchtime, you ain't got the heart when it's crunch time
Soldiers gettin' shot on the front line
Not really for a cause but for they brothers they lay their lives when it come time
Trust being brave is a challenge
If every soldier was brave, there'd be no word for valor
The nerve of these cowards, who are you, the herb of the hour?
I treat my girl like horiculture, I'm preservin' the flower

That's why, I don't fuck with these niggas, nope
I don't fuck with these niggas, nopeEmbed

A cautionary tale
I heard about this new artist
Somebody said he was the hardest
Seem like I gotta do the knowledge
Cause I don't go by them comments
Loving the promise of some new hot shit
And apparently this kid got it
He adored by all of them bloggers
They describe him down to his boxers
I heard last night he had problems
With some other random ass nigga
Tonight the blog is on fire
Them niggas beefing on twitter
His timeline full of depression
But his death the life of the party
They celebrating his self destruction
It make for excellent copy

Pills on his table, what
I heard he staying independent
He don't fuck with major labels
The rumors keep on swirling
Every interview is a circus
Yeah he grinding, he working
But his lack of God is disturbing
Can't wait to write about how the drugs to blame
He was numbing the pain, he was loving the fame
Plus think he going out with what's her name
With an ass so fat she won't fuck with lames

All the he said she said

Heard your baby mama got crazy drama
Get way too violent and drunk
Couldn't make an honest woman out of her
Now he face your honor every month
Now she slandering niggas on instagram
So her followers up and her kids be down
She be giving out advice how to get a man
On the sex tape part of a business plan
Now she coming out next to plug
A new song she gets on the breakfast club
Where party promoters give extra love
All the hypebeasts saying sit next to us
I heard a bunch of these rumors
I heard it made this nigga lose it
Only thing I have yet to hear
Is any of dude music

Niko, what's up

I do this shit cause I want
Man, don't need no reason
Started out at the Bodega
Now we at the Venetian
So Brazilian, but the clothes Parisian
I just do my thing and write like a king man I'm Stephen
These rappers Mr. Fantastic to me, they be reachin'
They poetically describing their gats
That they never squeezin' (pow)
Pardon me I'm starting to see it
Jobs is misleading
Even a snake infiltrated the garden of Eden
Boy stay around the time
It like Martin to Gina
They diggin' meaner than a Spartan's demeanour (Yo, keep it 3 hunnid)
Just spark it and park it
The valet be parking the beamer
Sharper than a ?
That orange indica Ha
You get it for the low
Like Forrest Whittaker's eye

Women in my life are gettin' jealous, because is my truest love
Get my eyes on the prize

Murderer of verses
I am Like Persus to Medusa brah
Better yet King Louis the Sixteenth
Them angels are falling like Lucifer
How could see coming its disgusting
This neck is gushing with too much blood
Academic fellowship even my mellow shit is super tough
Not the fellowship of the ring with the hobbits and talking junipers
I am a follower of the Freestyle Fellowship, them niggas knew their stuff
I'm a student of Myka 9
Long pieces of Jupiter
Nowadays rappers are stupider
Swearing to God that they blew up

Try to lay it down, try to close my eyes

At night I can't sleep
Cause my heart skip a beat
I can see it cause my heart on my sleeve
I can see the deceased
Tear into the flesh of the weak
Currency bear the mark of the beast
Never stand for the bull
Even when the market asleep
Anything I want is in arms reach
And the score is so sweet
But the consequence is that
I got to wear the mark of the thief

Stranger in a foreign land

Baby girl, hey ya

Loving

The sound of you comin'

Loving, loving, loving...

Ever you made love out in the rain
But your body so hot
That the water does not ??? in the flame
So arouse to the brain
??? Profanities coming out of you
And you shouting out my name
I'm the truth like I'm coming out ???
We are on the top of the world
And to reach this level had to climb a mountain of pain
But we are here now
Noting to fear now
Everything clear now
I ain't gotta tear down walls to your heart now
Every single stare down
Calling for sex
So emotional tear gonna fall
I applaud your agility
Should you really be deserving an encore standing ovation
Old faces, Got you feeling all flush
Cause we are touching in public places
In the studio alone on the console
Making amateurs movies in a condo
You gonna need a toe-tag like John Doe

Every sword need a chief
Animal attraction like I'm lord of the beast

It's not so much a business where you make a lot of money but if you enjoy the business then the money comes. But if you're looking for the fast, instant kind of famous and money it's going to be boring to you because it doesn't happen quite like that

Verse 1:
When the money come it's sweet as a honeybun
But when the money gone they hide like a honeycomb
They tell you get your education
Nigga, go to college
They colonizing your mind like Rhodesia
What you, a Rhodes scholar?
They never tell you that degree is just a receipt
You be paying off them loans til you're 6 feet deep
Peep
In my environment every snitch gon' have to die
You ask me why
Cuz my entitlement is American as apple pie
It's hard to get a check, it's easy to get in debt
Then get it wet
You could get a little head for a little bread
That shit is dead
Get by, get over
You gotta get ahead or be back in the shelter by 12 so you can get a bed
The conditions you raised in is preyin on your decision-making
You concentrating on that short paper
The broad paper, that hard candy, that jaw breaker
The dark side of the force pay for that Lord Vader

Verse 2:
The millionaire musician a fairly recent phenomenon
Before there was  musicians performing on the street corners
Out in the deep forest
The city drop the beat, the night air sing a sweet chorus
The trees lean toward us in order to take in the CO2 that we let out and convert it into oxygen
Every time you blow a breath out you start the cycle again
Recycle the wind, spin it any way you want it
It's priceless, this life is a blessing
No matter how you slice it or dice it, you can grill it like a swordfish
A beautiful mind, the bars gorgeous
I know I'm a suspect
When I'm walking and the streets is like my office
We the working class artists
They wishin that we was porpoise
But I know my worth
Tell em to make an offer of gold first
I'm in the fight of my life and I'm taking the whole purse
Soul search
For getting paid for creating the cold verse
Got the money on my mind
Tryna escape and it don't work

Repeat chorus1Embed
Violence has come, but many argue it’s also tolerated as long as Blacks and Hispanics fight each other, and as long as they do it in their own neighborhoods

Damn right, we got it
Damn right, I’m 'bout it
Police state trying to kill us
Will they succeed? I doubt it
Y'all don’t want no problems
So lame nigas be quiet
We 'bout to start the survival
We 'bout to start the survival
(Chorus)
That’s why we can’t have nice things
That’s why we can’t have nice things
(Verse 1)
Used to race home after school
Just to turn on the tube
To catch the new videos, thought I was cool
I’m talking Snoop, Dr. Dre, to Fugees, to Biggie, to Diddy, to Wu
My O.G. will come from the spot with the loot
Like, "Kweli you nice, niga. Hop in the booth."
Together Forever, the name of the crew
Now, I wonder is there any real rap left; is it just me yelling no justice no peace? (hands up!)
This new video full of black death, fuck rap 'cuz we dying at the hands of the police (hands up!)
Horror movies don’t get no scarier than the way cops treating nigas in America
See more videos of cops trying to bury us than ISIS, you tell me who's the terrorist
Terrorists making bomb threats ain’t got shit on the Prison Industrial Complex
Slavery to Jim Crow, now force my kinfolk into poverty, living in the projects! (trapped!)
Coming such a long way from living like kings
Now we like bling, wanna pull up in a white thing. (you trapped, niga)
This is why we can’t have nice things
Got to be prepared for the drama that it might bring
Jealousy gonna tear us apart
They say it’s all love, but what’s in their hearts?
The product in niggas, kidnapping your wife
You’re out in the desert like what’s in the box?
In your Brad Pitt voice
So what you have is a choice
You can have all of us thinking you’re moist
Or get like Chuck D and start bringing the noise
Rap life I attack like a pit bull
Let it off like a clip full
Known to stand up to all that bullshit that you sit through
Tell the world what we’ve been through, it’s pitiful

Raised in a borough or Brooklyn in the late 80's

Naw, it ain’t trap rap
It ain’t backpack (what’s that?)
This is what you sound like when you have facts
And you’re facing down the cops in a gas mask
Y'all be listening to lames? Well, we past that
Half-assed rap, you can have that back
All you fake deep niggas where your hashtag at?
Cut you open on the mic when I’m showing you the light
Niggas scatter like roaches, where the black flag at?
Radio solace is coming I promise you nigas I give you a preview (it’s coming)
Transparency, that’s the key
I got nothing to hide you niggas is see through
Trans parent, no Caitlyn genital

Fuck ever heavy metal shit real pop

Cops trying to kill guys but killed shot
Exploring every options while the water still trying to feed cops yeah
Everything a vibe but it's still the same
Only the real remain when i kill the game
Running over the niggers in a renter hearse
Then i erks tire marks tire marks
Wait that's a Kendrick verse
None i ain’t have to steal that
What's left when all of your layers are peeled back
Got a mind like a steel trap
And then fill it to the brim with real raps

Yep you wanna fall back (fall back)
You wanna fall back (fall back) 
If you the real shit you really real shit
Drop it let me feel shit if it's really real

Look at the conviction rate i got the colour that the system hate
Wait face facts as they face us the racist trying to erase us
Beat us to the truth then erase us
History is a high story Knee high
Don't watch exodus no one is our story
Rearrange the past no one is our glory
Not matter the colours of my brothers will ride for me


Hip hop is still evolving from stealing vaults
Some of these real life shit dont appear in blogs
Rap niggers soft this ain’t a pillow talk
At the club ain't saying nothing when they kill us all
Ah silence but you say you real ya that's how you feel huh
Ey yo fro real bro riders better watch who you steal from
A true steal gun tighter than the steel drum
We on that crazy steel drum
Smoking that B real what the fuck you feel one
Wow you niggers acting real young
Stop that recording that baby beef shit feel tongue
Yea no time for your hard feelings
Blood is in the ghetto my socks is like curry shillings
Un apologetic as fuck when they say my name
Open methic in the truck men i bring my pain

Oh you niggas wanna get deep?
Niggas wanna kick knowledge? Y'all niggas ain't deep man
Y'all niggas lost me
Soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin Illuminati
Then I'm like, show me the proof right?
Niggas start talking about the anti-Christ and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga
I'm a grown ass man. Let's go, let's go

You can lead a man to a drink but you can't make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link but that don't mean he gonn' click
What's this? Y'all ain't really on no deep shit, I peeped it
Scared of a motherfuckin' secret, society
And only bein' with people you agree with, you scared of a
Chalice, scared of death, only thing worse is your silence
Illuminati's enlightened, the OWL see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars, symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the knights or the Rite of the Scottish
You need to wake up, no new Bugatti (Yes)
My enemy tryna stop me
But I don't stand a chance if I can't identify 'em properly
Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission: abolishment of government and religion
They were enemys of the state, and they was hated by the Christians
They was Poets, they was Scholars, early Illuminati was
Sorta like the students in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss 'em, turning them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the founding fathers
The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati
Found this fascination the order was insipiration (Keep it goin')
And ain't no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan need to hide infomation
That's how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof, show 'em proof put it all on the table
When the facts are intact, ain't no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive
Real life's more complex, what's your context?
They put the symbols on the dollar bill, the monument, the obelisk
They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists
You can trace it back to the root trace it back again
It's really just another case of stealin' from the African
Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh?
Population control is real (word), you know the deal but still
Perpetuate the cycle of violence, we known to hold the steel
No, I don't need no fuckin' chorus
Used to read so many books, thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order
But you really don't know what you reading if you really don't know the author
A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof: a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and that's a fact
Don't get caught in the distraction, it's bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed ain't got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doing so sinister, worse than any blood sacrifice
You can imagine, iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the IMF
Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
Food, vaccines, humanitarian aid
They want control of the region, they really tryna get paid
Obey thy consumer make a product out of man
Where's the conspiracy? It's always been the plan
Y'all niggas scared of one world currency but still paying your
Taxes, it ain't the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy, suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of your enemy

No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh

Yo, I heard it's said the revolution won't be televised
But in the land of milk and honey there's a date you gotta sell it by
Otherwise it just expires and spoils
And these folks jump out the pot when the water too hot
Cause the fire boils inside
You go to church to find you some religion
And all you hear is connivin' and gossip and contradiction and
You try to vote and participate in the government
And the muh'fuckin' Democrats is actin' like Republicans
You join a organization that know black history
But ask them how they plan to make money and it's a mystery
Lookin' for the remedy but you can't see what's hurtin' you
The revolution's here, the revolution is personal
They call me the political rapper
Even after I tell 'em I don't fuck with politics
I don't even follow it

I'm like the dope in your tracks until your high is settled in
You leanin' to the left, the laughter's the best medicine
But the troubles you have today you just can't laugh away
Stay optimistic, thinking change is gonna come like Donny Hathaway
You have to pray, on top of that, act today
Cause opportunity shrivel away like Tom Hanks in "Cast Away"
Everybody pass away, the pastor prays, the family mournin'
Everybody act accordin' to the season that they born in (You'll try to change the world)
You fight in the streets, start bleedin' 'til the blood is pourin'
In the gutter, mothers cry 'til the Lord be livin' by the sword and
All that folks want is safety, they goin' gun crazy
The same reason Reagan was playin' war games in the '80s
The same reason I always rock dog chains on my babies
The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery

Remember, whatever discipline you’re in, whether you’re a musician or a photographer, a fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer, a singer, a designer — whatever you do, you have one thing that’s unique: You have the ability to make art. Sometimes life is hard. Things go wrong — in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health. And when things get tough, this is what you should do. Make good art

This about to be the realest shit you ever heard
I lynch rappers, got them hanging on my every word
These bitch rappers be claiming they slinging heavy word
Really snitch rappers, niggas singing like every bird
Rich rappers, nah, I don't know them niggas
Niggas don't get rich rapping, they selling clothes or liquor
My flow is sicker cause I flow with vigor
I'm no beginner, peep the whole agenda
Control my center cause I gravitate with Gravitas
This my inner monologue
Burning down your party cause our cocktails is molotov
My crime mob make you stop, lock and drop, don't get wollywop'd
Actually battery in my back like a copper top
Got it popping, started on the B-side of Body Rock
Direct to fan, I'm running my shop like my mom and pop
Modern day slavery today to be an artist, watch
They treat them like a product and try to mount like a hot 'n tot
Molly pop, niggas not caring if they body rot
Partying like Mardi Gras, get the cream like Häagen-Dazs
Golly gosh, this is Utopia, cornucopia
I'm known to start revolts against the Romans like Zenobia
Hoping to keep coping copious amounts of opiates
Tried to start a union, but they blocked me like a Soviet
I hope they get it, I'm sick of explaining history
I'm rolling with a circle of winners, we claimin' victories
It ain't a mystery, the hate'll make it bittersweet
They hate when I engage to debate 'em like Wale's Twitter feed
Who I'm kidding? I'm the great debater
My crew stay winning, we stay innovating
Your circle is rotten as great tomatoes
They get high with you then start dry snitching like Jose Canseco
Prosecco, I'm sipping vino with a vivid hue
Haberdasher rocking Borsalinos like Hasidic Jews
Pitiful, rappers never stand up to the ridicule
That's why I had to get at you
Wear it if it fit the shoe, nigga
(Baby, just shine your light
If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter
Just stay bright, so shine your light)

Take a trip, I got you floating on this real spit
I rock the boat so much you get nauseous and start to feel sick
Too many house niggas, I'm taking 'em on a field trip
Your fate is sealed: a life that come with a kill-switch
My wife said I've got demons I've yet to deal with
But I ain't trying to hear her though, my music is my mirror though
They like to put me on a pedestal for conscious rap
My flesh is edible, it's hard to keep the monsters back
The polar opposite of too emotional
Got feelings and emotions, just hoping I don't overdose
And miss the moments trying to control 'em til I'm on overload
Or hard to handle, we get dismantled and now I'm home alone
I power trip like I'm sampling Hubert Laws no more
I got honor, face my karma like a Buddhist law
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?

Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you

Demons want a pound of my flesh, it's quite accurate
It's tragic when you feel like your lawyer the devil advocate
Legal-ese ain't a language, they made it up
No wonder I'm losing blood, everybody taking a cut
Speaking in tongues, they depleting your funds, beating the drums
Of war to fry lines to your fortunate sons
You think boys point guns when they run to the sun?
A decoy, Pink Floyd, cause they're comfortably numb
Word, wrapping ourselves in denial like it's a warm blanket
Trying to go native like faces that get war painted
Pac shot in Las Vegas of all places
Fighting dark sides of the Force like he was Lord Vader
Y'all haters develop and lead the role
When they start to give 'em parts of your life and feed the trolls
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?

Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you
This feel like church, save that soul
That cry "good God, oh me, oh my!", I got to save them
All. Pray the Lord forever call on him
For setting the screen for evil things, then letting me ball on them
Pick and move, or you could die, nigga
Chuck and jive to stay alive, nigga
Propane flames burn your boots like strange perms
Some think "Don't take, will", but fuck it, you live and learn
Beware of the roots and salty looks
Voodoo they put on you, baby doll could leave you shook
Pens and needles, hoes and blokes
When it cracking, come snapping out even, kept them feelings afloat
I know, cause my folks lost souls off coast, never found
The triangle ain't just an ocean, it's on the ground
Take heed of the sign, dodging demons that find forgiveness
Young Krizzle

Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels

From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
In a state of grace
Where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence
So the selling never safe
At the same time snitching to the Jake
Is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake
But the problem we face seems so great
That we can't escape so we accept our fate
So the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint
If an artist is a part of a community
And got an opportunity to get that cake
Would never come back to the hood, no immunity
Usually a nigga like that so fake,no different from a snake
Nothing left to give cause you always wanna take
If you ain't using all the talents God provided you with
For the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste
Look into the face of a young girl
Raising up like a flag when it's unfurled
Got game listening to her mother's pearls
And she love Beyonce cause she run the world
Her mama used to run this city
Way back before the nigga Puff was Diddy
When it came to the music then she got real picky
From New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie
No disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge
And she felt that Pac was more lyrical
Plus she never went to college
But she called herself 'Earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual
She God in the physical
And it's only natural to pray for a little you
Musical so she played the umbilical cords
So her daughter was born it was a miracle
Music is the light when it's dark
And the way that you spit your dart is a big part
She grew up loving hip hop
Now all her daughter got is "Love & Hip Hop"
Nowadays niggas turn up for the sex
Niggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement
Ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid
Getting in the fights at reunions
She used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters
No desire for the lying and the violence
That's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment
Her body is politics
Lost count of how many whores she was called today
She won't do it no more, lost all her faith
They say she exaggerate when she hollerate
But it's only so much she can tolerate

She wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education
Her entire graduation was a dire situation
Did a paper on the state of the hip hop generation
But no longer felt a part of the conversation
Used to be I'm a ''ride or die'' chick
B.I.G. with the ''Me And My Bitch''
No objections, being an object,major label seeing a profit
She ain't never been a bitch or a ho
But she used to sing along when she heard it in a song
She used to be front row at the shows 'til she overdosed on the testosterone
Her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed
But she felt like she really ain't belong
When she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch
She erased all her songs from the phone
You are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with
You can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted
Just broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting
She tried not to judge him, in her heart she still loved him
And the way that he lusting, a part of his suffering
And this young man, clearly not ready for the harder discussion
Female emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew
I know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo
But she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude
Taking cues from the radio playing that doodoo
She on D'Angelo Pandora station playing that Voodoo, who knew?

In the face of hate
She'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great
I see lyrics as colors and shapes
Put it on tape, let her know I could relate
When you wish you could switch the way that you look
And your nose was smaller and your hair was straight
When you got no faith
When you hate yourself, when you hate your race
Let's get to the core
Our sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked
She a bitch, she a whore
And you rich and you shit on the poor
In all of your records and ask 'em to buy it
Why should I support music that constantly disrespects me?
And make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left
With the charge of repping it correctly
When it's free online or in a cloud
Ain't no reason to touch the radio dial
You wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air
And it's clear that your sales going down
Down by law then you found the raw
On a message board and you sounding off
These niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause?
No wonder why these niggas be sounding lost
Rhyming is a memory
The assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy
Stop giving them your soul, gift wrap
Prepackaged, fabricated shit rap
Running through you like fast food -  Big Mac's
You don't want no problems, fix that
All the time that you spent listening to that bullshit
Now you ain't never gon' get back

She don't love it, no
She don't love it no more12Embed

Heed the battle call, check the catalog
Flow so crazy it's adderall with the padded walls
More twisted turns in the body that's on the baddest broad
These cattle call 'rappers' is weak, my honor matter more
Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store
You mannequins are Chante & Kenny, I mean the Latter more
No ping pong and we volleying with the back and forth
Straight King Kong and the trap we blasting off, son

You want Nigerian money, see me in Qatar drunk
Waving the K, I can't fake the funk
Blessed with the belts, flying in the stealth
Jewelry on the neck, diamonds in the Cheals
You know I wrestle with pawns, getting my money, we gone
The automatic laying player, we Dons
You can't see us, the new phenoms, I like the Benz zeons
Split your wig like I got three arms
I need a fiancé, at least a Beyoncé, I know my vision beyond
Some other shit, I'm just as meaty as moms
I'm supposed to be on, the greenery gone, I'm still the king of the drama
Put the Ruger down your throat, eat my Johnson nigga

The Obi Wan Kenobi, of getting that guap-a-mole
We touring overseas, got her fanning out like a Dakota
I'm trying to get the check, I'm Martina Navratilova
Catch me at the races, gateway at Saratoga
They trying to place my face cause we mobbing, we taking over
My niggas keep it pure while you cut with the baking soda
These rappers be stretching the truth like they taking yoga
Couch potatoes, now they made us into a vegetable culture
A result of division like it's a decimal quotient
Do the math, my nigga, do the math
You'd never settle for less than the whole if you knew the half
Ayo, rough as alligator skin getting crazy grip
I'm so amazing with words I make a baby spit
Resting in Tibet, wild with the Gillette
Giraffe long goose on, my boots is 
Pocket full of coins, producers on set
Niggas with the coupes is on next
The losers gon' step, the users gon' check
We choosing our ninjas, the Jews is on deck
Refuse, that's a debt, pool with the steps
Everybody see us, the tools is all TECs
Anything come through we school, wan' bet?
Fuck you gon' tell us? He knew we on next

They wanna act like they know me, you don't know me nigga
You got the baby boy hustle, you a Jody nigga
You wanna swim with the sharks, I'm Chief Brody killin'
Get your jaw tapped this is raw rap, come on, yeah

Light it up, uh
Lighten it up, brighten it up, yea
You want the grown step your bars up
You brag about the scrilla them killas lighten your cars up
Welcome to the complete history
Of the one known as Talib Kweli

Such a blessing, I'm making the bread leven
Descendant of Terra Firma I'm from the era of legend
The blind to my eyesight, too scared of the world ending
My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven
Ascending without the stairs, expressing without the fears
We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
Unravelling minds, travelling through time Langoliers
Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
In the park of Washington Square, locks in my hair
Louder than the bull horns we was locking 'em there
Cops would prepare to lock us up
They was scared like tales from the dark side
Summer of the Central Park five 1989
Was the number, the year that I started rhyming
From Brooklyn to Staten Island them Decepticons was wildin'
Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats
Therapy for the prison industrial complex
Provided the context for the crime with the TEC-9
At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed
Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme
An internal with Puff Daddy, in front of the buffed patio
Rolling with Hi Tek in the MPV through the streets of the 'Nati
Before graduating to Caddies was carrying crates
Shoutout to Flex all day doing records with John Forte
We was standing outside the tower devouring prey, powerful
Display of bullet points that we shower and spray the block with
Back in them salad days these rappers was appetizers
I played it like I was David, I was tackling that Goliath
Attacking the open mics to the victory was decisive
This life it was so enticing, my surgery so precise
I would chop it like thin slices at parties we politic
At the country club, lighting up dutches with Pac and Big
At the crib of supernatural battling back and forth
Back before Jean was in the unsigned hype in the back of The Source
Rest in peace to Allah's sons, Shabba was liking to call you son
Cause you minor, I call you son cause you shine
What's up Alyasha, this is OG Brooklyn shit
Not for impostors (nah), pour out a shot of vodka for them
Big L (Big L), Big Poppa (Big Poppa)
Big Pun (Big Pun), 2Pac, what? (word)
The jungle is too savage, rap true master producing the new classic
This shit is too plastic, it's blow to  to spinal tap
I started with the Rawkus Recordings, we work the vinyl backwards
From DEF JUX to Loaded Lux, I'm the underground
King like I'm rolling with Bun, the vets know what's up
The flow is nuts it's solid, I got the golden touch
Plus my iron sheek and I got the game and the cobra clutch
This the highest caliber, do the algebra
From Yasiin Bey to Jean Grey to Pharoahe Monch
Black Thought to Common, almost 20 years after the
Release of Soundbombing and it still sounds timeless
I'm out and on tour with the greatest, A Tribe Called Quest
And the De La's, opened for Jay Z and Nas, who else could say this?
In Vegas with Tech N9ne getting faded before the gig
Only later to hit the RIO and hop on the stage with Prince
True story, I always knew the importance of great shows
Since 1992 I seen Ice Cube play Toads
Way cold, continue to pave the road for the
Kendricks and J. Coles, continue to stake gold
From making the way for Kanye to meetings with Mr. Harry Belafonte
All started on park benches with Dante
Predicting the future, so observant I'm clairvoyant

Welcome to the new age where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid
Thirsty for first in that page, really thirsty just to be fake
Be the first to hate what you say, trying to diss you calling you "gay"
Such an urgent need to express yourself, but really nothing to say
Don't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs
Like spit me out I'm chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up
I know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck
You told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love?
There's gotta be more, some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor
I've been through a door, I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for
The music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it, like it was pottery or
The mouth with the law, twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw
Free as the diamond you found on the floor, I furnished the rhyme with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my mind with the galore, so they burning with shaman, I'm popping the door
To top it all off, if your style is married to substance, you sound like you got a divorce
That's why I'm blocking and unfollowing y'all, I done forgot what I'm following for
Enough about y'all, now back to me, ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty
These new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece, so when they hear me rap it's catastrophe
Cause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef
I don't actually wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me

Martin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus, though as funny as it seems it remind me of us
Through the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust
Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under
Times getting hard, that's why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder
If all our people spreaded love instead of evil
We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal
Stay true, I gave you my oath, what would the ancient God my nigga Thoth

Got enough followers (what), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)

As I change the so called predestined course of my life
Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light
Moving these intricate insecurities out of sight
Moving myself forward from the darkness into the light
I take flight, it's goodbye to all the negativity
That plague millions of young innocent souls like me
Gave me the genius mind state necessary
To feast off of mother's unlimited figurative tree
Of life, I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it
Something like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions
As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism
I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism
Would you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions
In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming, catch up with us cause we leaving

We ride or die for them corners, fuck your private life they spy on us
When they catch us man it's like practice for the new tactics that they try on us
Them cops are lining them coffers, why we get shot we lying in coffins
They want my demise cause when I arrive they stop for lines so often
Nigga just stop, you might as well forfeit, we like Shia LaBeouf so lawless
Still recognize real, real recognize real like the car I'm driving you foreign
My diamond cut so flawless, no not jewels, I'm talking 'bout songs, bitch
So if they after me like I'm Lauryn, I just tell the feds that I'm Moorish

Standing out cause there's nothing but whores here, pimps rock crocodile like false tears

What's more real, what's more real? I got chicks fighting like floor sales

That's all I wanna do, baby
I mean really
I mean, I go out there, I work my whole life, baby
I put it down for you
I put it down for our kids
See, as a man I ain't got no excuse, baby
I'm the voice of the struggle
All I wanna do is write love songs about you

Love is a drug
Love is the gift, love is the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Love is so strong, take a hit, love is a drug
Love is the gift, love the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Never so strong, love is reap

How you expect to have an ordinary relationship with such an
Extraordinary nigga, yeah there's flaws in what you figured
Ain't the liquor that got you considering calling up the sitter
Telling her you need a couple hours and of course you tip her
I like my fantasies, half-stripper, half-glass slipper
Wrappin' one like a riddle with enigma
Character in my flip book coming to life when I'm
Flipping through the pictures, switching up the positions
My karma karma chameleon change colors with the surroundings
I can hear you with my eyes and I'm loving the way you sound
And I'm smothering and I'm grindin', now doubt is counting me out
Loving in public when we coming and up against the cupboard till we...
(Look like turquoise) Right on the couch
(Yellow on the bad day) Knocking it out without a doubt

My self reflection make the light change direction
When you see it from this angle the color, the cut the clarity
Starts bringing me down that's the depravity of gravity
Having me in my blue phase, go off the grid for a
Few days, go on a journey without a suitcase
The security of obscurity
In a world of respect and I'm trading it like it's currency
Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone
He so yella I'm wishin' his fella right his wrong
But naw, instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome
My light'll poke through the clouds, we'll take you higher like you
Smoking the loud while I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound
You can see it with your ears, you can hear it with your eyes
You can feel it right here yea

And nature's game once more begins

Here we go like, yes yes ya'll
To the beat ya'll
Ain't no sleep ya'll
To the break of dawn
Five o'clock in the morning
We keep rockin' on
The workin' people runnin' like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin' in the meat market
Chicks take a seat, park it
By the bar so they can meet the vic with deep pockets
And them dudes buy them cars and turn 'em in to sweet objects of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like it's heavy as hell
The Clan of the Cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the Cable Guy
Get 'er done
That 'ole hit 'n run
Turn 'em into bitter ones
Tonight is catch me if you can
You can taste the ginger bread
Ain't nothin' like wakin' up with a stranger in your bed, nope

Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Where am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn

Putting on some Airs
King For a Day
Hard to face your fears we wear the mask like Cory McKay
You have a ball today
It's all a masquerade
Shorty paint her face like a clown but can't take away the frown
Found under the make-up
I asked her, what's your passion
Answered, what's the paper
She sleepin' and they don't want her to wake up
Maybe then she'll realize her own beauty
Baby, you a star and not just a star on some dude's home movies

Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Where am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Steppin' out, I got my best outfit on
Gotta get it in
I'm slippin' in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree, now we hang behind the rope, we V.I.P
We do it B.I.G
Ain't no need to see I.D
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off don't need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little
The antidote is more colorful the rainbow that end in Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is your Tender Vittles to get the bruce to say the sky's fallin
Like you Chicken Little, come on

Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Where am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one

Take it to the top
Yea, that's where we at with it, hah
Take it to the top
Just cause you are a character, uh
Don't mean you have character
We taking stock right now
You ready? Let's go

A wise man know what he know, and what he doesn't
If he's not really sure what he's saying, he don't discuss it
A righteous man walks the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
A pious man relies on religion for his direction
At times he introspective, but his biblehood never questioned
A dying man will make a confession, try to get into heaven
Thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
A violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
Get post-traumatic stress disorder, become an officer
A man of peace uses his words in different mediums
He'll bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience
An honest man knows only liars are scared of the truth
His word is his bond but his action's always the proof
A faithful man never need evidence to believe
But still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

Top tier niggas blossomed in the basement
All the nights that we were lacking those refreshments
Rain down, thunderstorm with the flows
Articulate with the bounce now I'm back like I'm Derrick Rose
Once the one on the bench with the snotty nose
Nefertiti would hold me when I was cold
Communion Sunday, my twenties went in the bowl
Forgive me Lord for them bitches the night before
Business deals and the Bentleys I can't afford
Gotta be the example for children to do their chores
Blowing weed smoke on the cover of The Source
Rolling Stones, on the gone, it was the boss
Fallen soldier on his own so we march
Roll up a bag of that weed, therefore I spark
Recite the Quran, I'm in the dark
Devil knocking on my door, he like a narc
Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

No excuses, if I start it then I'll see it through
God is what I see in you so you might as well believe in you
Think what you see on TV's true? The media deceiving you
They misrepresenting, misquoting then they misleading you
Belief is a funny thing, in case you're wondering
If they want the ring, they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings
These average rappers is acting up for the dough
Yeah I tell you what I believe but I back it up with what I know (oh!)
It's the facts versus the facts simile, your raps killing me
My last victory was great moments in Black history
I celebrated with a bottle I just brought back from Italy
And some loud, I got super packs like I backed Hillary
Lost in desire, I walked through the Devil's fire
I inspire the resurrection of kings like Hezekiah
The trust you put in me to be a, beast with this rhyming
That's where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science
Let's go
Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

We do it for the babies
They say falling in love the definition of going crazy
The knowledge that makes us just cherish innocence makes it impossible
He heading for the graves, drivin' right past the hospital

There be glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
(Yeah) Woo! Move, motherfucker
I like that one (go in!)
C'mon

They say karma is a bitch and when you take a life, you pay the price
But if your way of life ain't been threatened and you safe at night
How you out here judgin' thinkin' you givin' people great advice
When those who should protect you disrespect you? You can't take it light
Bresha Meadows, resemble my baby girl
14 years old taking a place in this crazy world
Her and her brothers lived in fear of their father's rage
He beat their mother so often, she prayed for the day she could be far away
Father's Day, an awkward occasion would daddy fall from grace
Embrace the alcohol, call mommy a whore, put her back in her place
With black eyes, broken ribs, slashin' her weight
No speculation, just the facts of the case
Stated, allegedly wavin' a gun in her face
After all that he came back, and was great, right, right?
Tired of hearin' mommy scream "Put the gun away"
She knew that when she got the courage she would run away
But what about her brothers? She couldn't leave her mother
They told the cops but all that did was make him treat them rougher
So what was she to do? She did what she was told to do
Exposure to violence increased the amount of violence that you open to
Why bother when the system support her father?
Gradually her thoughts got darker
Do you kill yourself or kill the monster that's making you suicidal?
Decision's too heavy for the mind of a child

Let's go

They say karma is a bitch and when you take a life, you pay the price
We shootin' in these moments to confuse your violence with a way of life
The funnel us from schools to the prisons, it's like they made a pipe
The conclusion that we reach is that the solution is that we take the fight
To you, Bresha Meadows, took matters in her own hands
14 years old with more courage than a grown man
Grabbed the gun that he threatened to whip
Crept in the bedroom, put the bullet in his brain while he slept
It left his daughter with post-traumatic stress disorder
She the phoenix out the flames, it's metamorphosis
Survivin' in the Meadows house was kinda like a war
He threatened to kill her mother and her brothers many times before
The justice system is profit, they shuffle us to prison
But shit is just as toxic for women to get a judge to listen
At first the family freaked out but deep down they felt relief
"Wipe the tears from your cheek, mama, you free now"
Family wearin' purple in the court room
Prosecution lookin' at the feds like make your move
Chance of beatin' this murder feel like zero
Her mama doin' interviews like "She's my hero"
She shed no tears for her husband
Years of succumbin' to her fears have made her numb
From video games to war as we solve our problems with violence
It's how we speak, they either want your death or your silence4Embed
Yeah man, I'mma get me a boat

You know the deal
Yo, I never let up, keep it flashier than old-school get-ups
Got it crackin' like old-school leather
Reminiscent of a more wholesome era
I would ask a little girl if we could go together
Little Stevie finish, read the harmonica
Archie and Jughead, Betty and Veronica
I learned life ain't a comic though
No, put away the toys a long time ago
New name for the studio is Kweliwood

Now I'm the one the haters see, let's be clear
Yeah, bet now you remember me
Give you a reminder cause you act like your memory
Lost like Dory while you off finding Nemo
Talking you a boss, you as soft as Brian Eno
Tellin' all these stories, why you lying to the people?
Why you fronting like you want it but you rhyming kinda emo?
Tryna find a needle in a haystack easier
Than tryna find a leader in the mainstream media
Never knowing where we headed

Spit flows that invented cause of skid row
Tiptoe when you enterin' the zip code
Pistols, brandish it, we never hand 'em in
Accessory to crime got 'em handling the shenanigans
And the hand God brings like the Mandarin
Ugly sense, picking Polo rugbies off the manequin
Woo, now I'm feeling like the new wave
Like I'm two days deep into my blue phase
My baby hate that I'm living out of suitcase
Like I forgot to tie the knot like the shoelace
Let me be your liberator
Get yourself together, we gon' see each other later
You could be my love or you could be another hater
Why you frontin' tryna run from all this deviant behavior like
Yeah, Whisky Boys

It was as beautiful as Hawaiian beaches
Usually it's the students to be the truest teachers
(No doubt, you know how we do)
So gorgeous, this the magic hour, yeah
Start of a new day, it's a new way
Get with the new way

Uh, back to the future like a delorean
Documenting the struggle I'm huddling with historians
Making a way back to Brooklyn like we the warriors
Told you this man's story bordering on vainglorious
Heading to Cali for an education of Sonny Carson
And the need to police resurrection of Johnnie Cochran
Never accepted the rejection cause failure never an option
That's the gospel like Mahalia, I'm a legend, I've been a problem nigga
They still asleep in this dormez-vous like Frere Jacques
Pardon my french like Remy Martin and Henny bottles
The chances of survival more shallow than winning lotto
The liquor that they swallow got them rattled, plenty Benny Blanco bravado
Look at 'em fronting for these models
La mujeres mulattos on the floor with the wobble wobble
Sipping moscato while selling themselves for follows
This shit is intense like a Pentecostal revival
I'm in these streets like potholes, where the guns make Illinois to Chicago
Bap bap bap like staccato
I spit it like I just finished gargling the velocity marvelous
Get your goggles, we hit it at full throttle
I'm praying for a better tomorrow, my candle is burning slow as cubanos
I'm seeing red like Ricky Ricardo
They tried to stop my product like an embargo, but see they wallow in their sorrows
So they promises is empty and hollow, mahalo
Uh, live my life in the sunshine
Bust rhymes, beautiful as the sunrise
Plus side but the orchestra like I'm Sun Ra
Got with Alchemist like a wonder twin then we combine
The face of God got the finest features
And she listening if you tryna reach her
High Valyrian rap, looking for my Khaleesi
The ones that Ebro call minor league is the real fire breathers

You follow a carbon copies I'm stoppin' to intervene
You're erroneous, these the phoniest rappers I've ever seen
When I take flight, I'm traveling light, that's a double entendre
For when I'm touring, exploring outside the genre
Illuminate, when I grabbin the mic, it's so bright it'll blind you
Yeah I'm back with a friendly reminder
We're two ships that're passing in the night, but alas
You got to run into the iceberg, I'm cracking this shit in half
Traveling light, not talking about back of the back
First I get back in the lab, then I hit the road, I'll be back in a flash
I'm Barry Allen mixed with Harry Allen
My blood hot as volcanic rock forming canary diamonds they find on Canary Islands
My rhymes inspired by enviroments of the very violent

Smashing through these barriers, I'm blasting out your speakers now
Travel around the planet till I landin where I'm needed now
We entertainers, they wanna call us leaders now
Woah, extra baggage not in the plans, I'll shop when I land
Stop for the fans, every airport from Okinawa to Osaka, Japan
Stop assuming I live in your time zone
Jetlag is my reality, the road is my home, I roam
Your downfall is you should probably get out more
I been planning out tours, with a band of outlaws
I'm packing my bags, just marijuana and magazines
Wrapping the flag around a pistol, the red, the black and the green
Never crashing, the grill is mean when I'm whipping machines
Dipping between all these commuters, they moving slow like they sippin the lean
Are they living the dream? Get to they office
And that computer's drifting off until they spit start to drip from the screen

City of broken promises, my mission is reconnaissance
It's dangerous for anybody following
That's why I take biting as a compliment, it's proof of my dominance
It's the haters' way of congratulating me for my accomplishments
Well, I'm so atop of this demolishing all the charlatans
To whisper in the ears of your congressmen
Shoving dollars in their pockets, the more we locked up, the more they profiting
They building empires like Ottoman
Now who you wanna face? The sharks in the water or the snakes in the boat?
The lesser of two evils be fighting for fake votes
We walking through the valley of darkness so stay close
Need the light at the end of the tunnel to make a toast
Raise a glass to our glorious past, we the wave of the future
Never confusing protesters for looters
Silencing Radioheads and OK Computers
Travel to Mecca like Mansa Musa so let's go

The common myth that we're savages with no history or accomplishments
Or knowledge of ourselves, they did a job on us
Considering the prediction of economists, machines will do our jobs for us
The future for the working class is ominous
They got us indoctrinated through a bitch's brew, a religion mixed in with abuse
Emotional we sit in pews, it's physical, we get the noose
And hang ourselves refusing to name ourselves, refuse to change ourselves
When I talk about our past it doesn't ring a bell
They make you hate yourself it take effort so check the method
They'll take you from your family, your kids will never respect ya
Attach your sins to the black of skin we get the message

We on the last page and line, the verse with all the babies dying
Outside of the matrix, inside of the spaceship but the savior's blind
Or so it seems, years after Noah was told he would row upstream
The heavens bursted and the rains came
Retaliation for the sons of the fathers who worked the chain gangs

When the angel and the devil on the shoulder speak
Two voices, two choices
Prepare for war or go in peace
They don’t believe I’m touring overseas
“Nah, he don’t even rap about coca leaves”
Think globally, not locally
You ain’t woke as me, nigga go to sleep
Thank God I’m back, this ain’t hard in fact

You can wet it up, you can step it up
You ain’t catching up with my jet stream
And I’m going too fast so I put ‘em up last
Why you showing yo ass? This ain’t sex scenes
They ain’t built to last, they bust quicker
Fast talking like tongue twister
These young spitters can’t fuck with us
Pardon my French like I tongue kissed her
Back in the day they used to hunt niggas
And they hung niggas for being hung niggas
Now the guns are spittin’ when the hunger hit us

I’m a motion picture, let the movie begin
Scared to hit niggas, they’ll sue me again
Got platinum plaques, I’m a truly gem
I’m a rudeboy, roll the doobie again
Forward marching, we moving in
Flocka!
Flatbush to Abbey Road, who got that soul?
We 100 on the road, 100 at home
Rose from the ruins like a Pac poem
We ain’t going back to the Brook without the chip
We ain’t going back without that chip
We ain’t coming back to the Brook without that chip
We ain’t coming back without that chip
You got next, we got forever, join the list3Embed
It's all good, do or die, man
I hear ya, before I come out and go to work and whatnot
I hear a shoot-out and whatnot (yeah right)
You know, what you hear, pop-pop-pop
Listen, and I'm like, "Yo"
My moms'd be like, "Yo, you ain't going out in that"
I said "Look, yo, a brother gotta make a living"
You gotta do what you gotta do

The vampires make you fear the night
That kind of talk give them evil spirits life
She on the track like she waiting for her tears to dry
Listen real close you can hear the city cry
You hear it right?
It's like every night the city die
We the blood, we give the city life
Living the city life

The city get restless when the sun go down
The words get heated and the guns go (*pow*)
I used to joke and smile now everyone's so foul
He grab the heat before he leave out the front door now
Check the weather, what's the forecast?
Tryna make it rain, lookin' for more cash
Little man ain't got no parents, who you gon' follow
When your role models send you to the store for a cold bottle?
And you come back and see 'em in cuffs will be enough
To hate police, and define manhood as being tough
Sneakers scuffed and them toes turnt up, this shit is aggravating
It's hard to put holes in denim, this ain't a fashion statement
Yelling out "That's my car", so fascinated
By material gain, it's already ours in our imagination
The matri-nations of supremacy is masturbation
The master race should make you want to mash your face
And run right up in somebody gates, like "Where the fuck the safe?"
Small, quiet dude in the back, like "I know just the place"
He flash a toothy grin the jakes love to hate
And then he flashed the gun he had tucked in his waist
The conversations, son, I'm hearing are overbearing
Ain't no preparing for how much the hood be oversharing
(Word) The night time, always the right time
When your blood is what's flowing through the school-to-prison pipeline

When you ain't got a pot to piss
Everybody on the block is your competition
Police all in your pocket, you're forced to forfeit
When your espionage is corporate, that means you got an office
Instead arrested for the petty theft
Expected to apologise for every breath
A warrior stood in the face of many deaths
But since they colonized us, are there any left?
He in the streets like he ain't got a home
Writing a poem to the beat of the sobs and moans
Ran into Joan, skin chocolate as a Toblerone
Clickety-clack of stilettos on wet cobblestones
Streetlights illuminate how truly dark it is
The block is a college, you got a degree in marketing
A doctorate in swallowing, this pimping paid her scholarships
She poppin' out her tits cause they pay her to be provocative
Broke niggas tryna holla though (holla though)
But they ain't got no dollars though (dollars though)
It sound like, "I'ma hit a lick anyday
So fuck you bitch, she don't look that good anyway"
(You don't even look good anyway) Since when is pettiness a virtue?
Cops circle the block, they went from stop and frisk to stop and merc you
Smoking dark purple in a crop circle
Fast life, this entourage is saying "Got terfs"
The vampires make you fear the night
That kind of talk give them evil spirits life
She on the track like she waiting for her tears to dry
Listen real close you can hear the city cry
You hear it right?

I know, we back
We home, let’s go
I know, we back
We home, let’s go!
Check it out

Born this way
The universe wasn’t formed in a day
Praise the Lord and pray
We the children of God, better learn how to walk this way
Try to walk with faith but it’s hard, what more could I say?
I feel I’m cursed so I talk this way
Gotta write what I’m livin’ in graffiti
It’s the hood hieroglyphics so I’m lookin’ for a wall to spray
You could picture me rollin’, you could picture me holdin’
You could never picture me foldin’
Refuse to beholden to your racist image of a Black man
Kiss my entire colon
Great mind, even though the legacy is stolen
It’s all for the silver and gold
You can tell you in the ghetto from the litter in the road
Man this middle-of-the-road shit really getting old
Which one is the real you? I don’t know, it’s still you
How can I tell if you under a spell? Did the fake you kill you?
Better pass the mic in the afterlife
If so, let me spit flows, good enough to offer to God as a sacrifice
Born again like I passed away, castigated for being honest
Caught bail like a castaway, cause I feel like I’m swimmin’ on an island
When I’m gettin’ introspective: that’s radio silence
When I’m fuckin’ up program directives: that’s radio violence
You might also like
You were the one who wants to slow me down
I’m a criminal when you’re around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to unplug me?

Born this way, woke up like this
The midpoint between science and religion
Is tryna find out what the meaning of life is
October 3rd, '75, my birth is a blessing
Ain’t no spoken word could ever describe how the flow get better
I live on the edge, I’ll send you a postcard
Fuck a phone, I got a chip on my neck that’s a close call
Turn the lights off, see how we glow in the dark
Or we growin’ apart or tryna survive the flood like we in Noah’s Ark
We battin’ down the hatchets and we set sail
Tryna get far away from inhalin’ them chemtrails
My intel says they makin’ people out of the stem cells
The gun's our sunflower seed, we love to spit shells
When them super soakers get let off, it don’t end well
"I ain't know you like to get wet, dawg", like Denzel
They hype it up like marketers, sparklin’ like a fish scale
'Til you chasin’ a high like Captain Ahab after that big whale
It’s criminal
You were the one who wants to slow me down
I’m a criminal when you’re around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to unplug me?


Born this way, Capricorn, L.A. on the day of January 15
Dr. King, his dream torn from a warm womb formed from the clay, existing
Shifting from the essence, uplifting in the presence, just drifting, gifting
Through this mortal coil, with mystic lessons from the sage
California spoiled a blessing, blissed up, my first breath in outer space
I kissed death in the face, no identity complex, it gets left in its place
I’m proud to say, no aborted torment to my rejection
Miffed, dismayed and somewhat befuddled
I struggled to hustle and come up when the blood corpuscle boils
I'm pressin' issues, it's business that's mixed with pleasure
It's plizness to play and get paid during this clone war for DNA
You should know more about the donors confessing my doula from prenatal
I'm off fire, water, elixir of liquor with soft or hardcore drugs in my system
Sicker desire to be delivered wisdom, pour black, white sexy texture of lovers
Like jungle fever, wild zebras to make this fetus, brother
The son of my father, I want to hear my one Shawki and my daughter Aja
Lecture selections in musical meters in physics, you should explore and visit more
Exquisite shores and districts, take a breather
Believe in your epic eye memory, you are descendant of natural leaders
Extended from before the Nephilim, Bethlehem, even Eden
And new testaments, Heaven-sent, energy, books, messages read them
Scriptures, look at the various sizes of giants in Egyptian pictures
Stonehenge endured the mathematics of Mayans and megalithic structures
Evidence frequencies Vedas, we're just the latest reproduction
Created out of pure star dust and made in his image but God is greatest!Embed

Rap life
License and invitation to act like
I'm living the fast life
Long way away from relating to the Pharcyde
I was the dude they used to pass by
Looking for her in the day with a flashlight, that type
That's until I got my cash right, heh
You should have seen your boy last night, that's right
Acting like I was a god in the past life, this is your last try
If I don't act right, this what you said the last time
We know each other so well that we past lying
And we past crying, and we past fighting
It's like dealing with women my favorite past time
I love finding trails to path find, ain't nothing like it
When you stop calling, that was a bad sign
Remember you would blow up the batline now flatline
I was scared to fall asleep so I nap light
One eye open and my phone in my path of sight
Hoping I don't wake up to a catfight
Exposed like them hotel sheets in the black light
You let me cook like the pot was cast iron
And stayed through the good and the bad times
So that's why, I'm back in line tryna get off your bad side
It might take some time and that's fine but trust this

Signed, sealed and delivered but you still with a nigga
Now my ex chick is ill but you the best in the field
Place your bets, here's a mil', I invest in the real
Went from Netflix and chill to breakfast in Brazil
Went from Mexican villas straight to Texas for grills
We the best when we building
Got the egg in the nest and it's chilling, it's left for the children
The hate is so real son
But they full of jealousy and it's killing them, they stressed in their feelings
When I tell her don't let them affect how she feels
She throw the blame right back at me, how we expect to heal?
Investigating like she be waiting for a detective shield
Better still feeling insecure about her sex appeal
She know she cute when she catching a little attitude
She know I love her when she wear her hair natural
She let me back in her life and I show my gratitude
I try to curb my habit of acting like other rappers do
Them other chicks ships in the night, they just passing through
They ain't invested what you invested, you got the capital
To put up and you actually put up with the collateral
Damage that I cause but you back and it's magical, yeah

Peace, peace, everything we do is a creation
In complete harmony, our creation becomes art
Everything we've ever invented stems from the human imagination
Everything we've ever invented or created
That moved an era is recognized as work of genius
Science and the empirical man, philosophy and the thinker
Religion and the shaman, art and the sick who can metabolize
Everything with a trace of decay is human error
Forgivable human error the curse
From the radiance of the gift which becomes shadow
Necessary evil so to speak, or we'd have figured it out by now
Striving for perfection is a result of genius
Find peace, share your genius
See I can't see my own face without a reflection
Whether it be your reaction to my expression, a mirror or water
I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
Through this understanding, I know that all things are one
According to science, everything is a wave of energy
A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
My eyes are receptors for another type of energy
Which my mind then depicts as images, same goes for smell and touch
Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
Now when given full attention to something other than time and space
Time and space disappear, I'm simply doing
Yesterday, tomorrow, here, there, poof!
It is always now, all is energy
Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
Technically I'm only a vessel channeling those thoughts
My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies
Which I either contemplate or share with the outside
I believe we all function with the same foundation
Energy, which is everything
Everything is one big ocean of energy
Everything is within you, everything is you
The identity of me is but a series of memories
In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
Remember it is always now
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
In other words, energy can neither be created or destroyed
Energy only transforms
We are thus forever, and death is but a blink
So I ask why hurt? Why kill? Why hate? Why fear? Why war?
Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself?
Can the state of the world change?
Can the state of the world change?
If energy only seems to transform then why not?
It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
A planet amongst other planets routing around the sun
In the same fashion as electrons do
Around the nucleus which form the cells, which form us
Ah yes, all is one, and my friends, it is beautiful
Let us unify our heart, now feel your power and I thank you
Peace and forever

Yeah, uh
Snap ya fingers, do ya step
Ayyy, where we at with it?
Where you at? Uh, uh
What era is this, man?

The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
Delivered hand to hand like we slangin' the mixtapes
You tryin' to describe us, you might as well get it straight
We the content creators, we greater than clickbait
The passion for the culture, the vultures they try to kill it
It's a war for your spirit, the lyrics is here to heal us
We looking for the fountain to keep us forever young
While I get my energy from the sun, all things are one
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongue
My color is my penalty mentally on the run
Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun, huh
Releasing blockages I ain't stoppin' until they gone
Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
Until I realized I can change what's going on (let's go!)
To every single place I go I'm right at home
I'm right at home (let's go!)
Waiting for that day to come, huh
Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
Get my energy from the sun
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongues

Sort of like when Diddy ran the city
Fuck with us and guns pop out like Janet's titty
Yo, I got niggas ready for the main event
That's why I'm still around and all those corny niggas came and went
Top shotter rocking with Trotter and got the Game on deck
Stroll through any hood and get the same respect

Comptons Kool G Rap, black All Stars
10 khakis and a red Blue Jay hat
I’m lowridin' on 100 spoke daytons
Nigga with an attitude like Nas buying jewelry from Jacob
I’m don’t play that mixtape shit
Say my name and I buck 50 ya face like Miami Haitian
I’m gangsta homie, check my verse
I’m lyrically Big Daddy Kane in Converse
And niggas think we just Boys N The Hood
And the city of angels got poisoned by Suge
I take the drama, roll it up in a swisher
Let Kweli hit it then lower the switches
I’m 3 wheelin’, through the Wilshire district
Thinking how Big and Pac both died by pistols
L.A. Times called it the Death Row conspiracy
Run up on my 6-4, i’ll take out ya misery

This the story of - Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying
Was a science, dreams too big for a small town
She gotta get to New York and watch a door fall down
Hopped off the Greyhound, gotta make her way now
She sleeping on the park benches in the playground
But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick
Ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp
Flashing his toothy smile that drove little Lucy wild
She quick to hop up on his dick straight Hoopie style
She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit 
He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it
She looking for love in all of the above
Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug
Who wanna - put it in her, withdraw like a Citi card
But now she shake that ass for tips at the titty bar
 (Pharrell)
Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Try to hold back your tears baby! (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Wait a second, what happens here baby? (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!!)
Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah

Throw a song on the phonograph, and Lucy start wilin
The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying
The Gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush
Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush
Time's up, she's about to turn 33
Her shit started to sag, she got surgery
Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van
Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N.E.R.D. fan
Bigger house, 10,000 dollar purse fam
She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man
She the ring leader in a clique of birds
And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain


She was a small city girl with big city dreams
Niggas try to figure how to get up in them jeans
Put her in them scenes, get her on the team
Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes
Now she all up in the club looking for a new love
Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug
Cause coke's getting old, started free basing
Graduated to crack, smack on occasion
Not catching the bus, but back at the station
Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient
Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'
Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high
Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame
Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name
She need a ticket home if it's the right course
Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse

Followers in the herd runnin' over the cliff

Party people, put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze 'til no man is dry
We wet it up while askin' the people if they plannin' to die
They can't stay to live, consumers is plannin' to buy
Slow death, operators is standin' by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family, why
Do they make it so hard for a man to provide?
Yo, you better get with it or stand to the side, stand to side
Bada-bada-bada-ba (Stand to the side)
Bada-bada-bada-dadada (You better get with it or stand to the side)
Bada-bada-bada-ba (Stand to the side, stand to the side)

Bada-bada-bada-ba
Bada-bada-bada-dadada
Bada-bada-bada-ba (Yeah)
Bada-bada-bada-dadada

And the storyline goes on, right to left, who's right, who's wrong
Fuck the politics and pride, I just to try to stay alive
To witness where the battle lines are drawn
Speak my mind and I sing my song (Sing)
I'm passin' on the moral y'all
'Cause this is ain't play, true God
Know the weight is hard now (Yeah, Vinia Mo, yeah)
Open eyes, see for hopeful lives, sing it now (Now, keep it alive, see it y'all, yeah, come on)

Bada-bada-bada-ba (Da-da-da)

Bada-bada-bada-dadada (Right in, right in)
Bada-bada-bada-ba
Bada-bada-bada-dadada (Yeah, yeah)
Makin' my way through life, talkin' to elders and takin' advice
Ignorin' their words and payin' the price
Livin' in the world where false preachers got us prayin' to Christ
Get with the young girls in the choir and be layin' the pipe
No control of our soul we all wait at the light
So comfortable, that we hatin' to fight to make it right
Late at night I'm controlled by the DJ on the mic
I love hip-hop and every joint he playin' is tight
A day in the life is a brick in the foundation, I'm like
A mason in Egypt, amazin' when I'm creatin' a site
For the world to behold and the story to last
So one day ghetto children can visit their glorious past (Uh)
After Pac and Notorious passed, what do we have?
Niggas worth more when they dead, it's so sad
Started with the slavery, we finished the plan
But I broke the cycle and became a man

Party people, put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze 'til no man is dry
We wet it up while askin' the people if they plannin' to die
They can't stay to live, consumers is plannin' to buy
Slow death, operators is standin' by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family, why
Do they make it so hard for a man to provide?
Yo, you better get with it or stand to the side, stand to side (Yo, just stand to the side)

In order to expand, I'm just thinking
I don't wanna ever drop, I don't wanna lose the moniker
The Talib Kweli moniker, but I'm thinking over headlights, it doesn't fly
I wanna just put it in your head, you don't have to answer me now
We don't have to come with anything now
I wanna maybe talk about, you know, like, P. Diddy, he changed it
Talib Kweli, AKA "T-Kwilly" (Oof)
"T-Biggity," something, you figure it out, you're the artist, see
That's why you get paid the big bucks2Embed
The proud
Stand tall or don't stand at all, come on, uh
Yeah
Break it down
What we do?

We survive (Uh), it's more than pride (Word)
We stay alive (Word), ready to ride (Ride, one-two, one-two, yo)
We survive, it's more than pride (Yeah)
We stay alive, ready to ride (Put it down, yo)
We survive (June 11, 2001)
It's more than pride (Timothy McVeigh is executed)
We stay alive (And the country breathes a sigh of relief)
Ready to ride (Goodness prevails over evil, it seems)
We survive, it's more than pride (Somehow, with him gone)
We stay alive (We feel safer)
Ready to ride (Little do we know)

Today, the paper say Timothy McVeigh's in hell
So everything's okay and all must be well
I remember in Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing on the front page
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
Wrong, it's just the beginning, the first inning
Battle for America's soul, the devil's winning
The president is Bush, the vice president's a Dick
So a whole lot of fucking is what we gon' get
They don't wanna raise the babies, so the election is fixed
That's why we don't be fucking with politics
They bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down, bit by dogs, and got Blacks into house arrest for that
It's all good except for that, we still poor
And money, power, respect is what we kill for, for real

We stay alive (I struggle)
Ready to ride (To explain the situation to my son, it's hard)

Niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than niggas with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal, but what the fuck do I tell my son?
I want him living right, living good, respect the rules
He's five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
He'll be perceived as a threat or see the fear in they eyes?
It's in they job description to terminate the threat
So forty-one shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set, don't matter you he follow the law
I know I'll give my son pride and make him swallow it all (Damn)
Fuck the pigs, I think the pigs killed Big and Pac too
If they didn't they know who did, they got to
Who they serve and protect? Nigga, not you
Cops shot off of ten G's, but they got Glocks too
Let you protect yourself or better yet, respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
Doing them favors, so they workin' for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder asked me what I say to a dead cop's wife
Cops kill my people every day, that's life
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride (Yeah)
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive (September 11, 2001)
It's more than pride (Terrorists attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center)
We stay alive (It kills thousands and permanently scars America's false sense of security)
Ready to ride
We survive (We see the best examples of humanity in the face of the worst)
It's more than pride (As firefighters, police officers)
We stay alive (Rescue workers and volunteers of all sorts fight to save lives)
Ready to ride (The world will never be the same again)

My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red, Black, yellow, white, and brown heroes
It's more complicated than Black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But it's hard for me to walk down the block
Seein' rats and roaches, crack files and forty-ounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
It's a hard conversation to have
We lost kids, moms, and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
Damn, when did shit get this bad?
America kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad, damn
Welcome to the world, we here
We've been at war for years, but it's much more clear (Yeah)
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and ride for the dead
We survive (Yeah), it's more than pride (Much more)
We stay alive (Uh), ready to ride (Let's go)

Why you playing, why you playing?

With some more hot shit ready to spit for you
With the songs that you love just to get you through
Ma

Back in effect
I'm back to collect
Got the respect
Which will turn into the cash or a check
You can, pay me with fear, you can pay me with love
You can, pay me in tears or you can pay me in blood
Spray me with slugs, and the revolution live, I never die in vain
The writer might be dead but the piece remain on the train (yea)
The music help you be true to yourself, accumulate wealth
So what I spit is the embodiment I do for self
As a teen it was kinda hard to find a job
I took over my writer's block and ran it like a spot
I'm Pimp C in this game nigga, I'm a hard
But I'm never feasting on it, keep speaking on it God
That's what they say when I'm building, I keep my dialogue street
But still spiritual like we deep inside a mosque
Or the synagouge that don't preach or go where the sinners are
And keep the fire burning like a slum lord in the Bronx

Rhyme writer from nine to five
It's the 25 to lifers with the balance of the acrobatic high wires
The pain of the slave with his back feeling like fire
'Cuz the whip talking to his ass like Knight Rider
Most of these rappers nowadays be sounding like liars
Got visions of guns in they head like the Pied Piper
When I bust they start to disappear like my lighters
'Cuz they shit is faker than the dreads on Mikah Phifer
The industry is in trouble
Plus these industry niggas is fake, so they tend to be in a bubble
So I hit the block where they're known to thicken the plot
Sticking up cops, kids be pocket-picking they Glocks (my man)
Balling outta control, don't be forgetting that niggas is broker than dishes at a Greek wedding
They might try to run up on you, take your life quick
It's like this when you walk the strip up on the night shift

Let 'em know
Of course I will 'cuz you know how I do
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me... call me)
I be going like two & two
With some more hot shit ready to spit for you

Ma
This right here the bare essentials with no extras y'all
I kept it raw from the school of thought where less is more
Brooklyn is cooking and I blessed it with the special sauce
I got the soul of a prophet and never take a loss
Fresher than kicks out the box, the kids on the block
That is street hungry trying to get that sweet honey out the rock
Crack in the socks when they click the row thicker than sour sop
Listening to my black power rock
Music, of this hip hop we be rocking to it
I'm a river, you a valley, watch me run right through it
You wanna learn how to do it, tell the truth in your single first
Lil' Kim went to jail for what you do in every single verse (free Lil' Kim)
Lyrics is perjury, your beats is more plastic than surgery
And we in the United States of emergency
One of the main reasons none of you lames worry me
Is I change lanes like I change planes and change currency

They wanna know, tell them (All you have to do is call me)
Of course I will 'cuz you know how I do
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me... call me)

There’s a first time for everything
There’s a first time for everything
But don’t be afraid of what’s in the dark
Just open your eyes and see what’s in they heart
I remember the first time I left it up to you
But I learned from the first time to never trust in you

Ay yo, the first time ever I saw your face
I recall the case
Cut the grass now I see all the snakes
My lawyer man cake
Cause of you he’s been employed by the beef
And now it’s time to half court in the street
Falling asleep on your boy is not recommended
He felt the weapon in your chest because I’m well respected
So when you disrespect reflection then your health effected
I go harder than any demon that hell invented
I never felt threatened
By none of these industry motherfuckers
Cause they smucks and they blood suckers
You can come quicker than sideways or backwards
I always come straight up in your face
Your mistake is confusing me with a rapper
That interviews and a fashion
You assuming I’m passive
I’m really truly a master
Of lyrically moving masses
It’s true but if you attack us
I’m never the one to back off
Never the one to slack off
I’m making them take the mask off
It’s beautiful when I black out, it’s natural like disasters
My body is like a host for a ghost of the middle passage
You not imagining the noise you hear is laughter
They giggle behind your back you enacted your family matters
You read into what’s happening and kill it like an assassin
Looking for that applause when all you get is the clappin’
I’m serious about my craft don’t ever confuse the masses
By taking my outtakes and trying to repackage them
It’s never forgive action

You only get one chance to make a first impression
That’s why I always make sure I come the freshest
Whether I start or my words ending
I’m here to exercise my first amendment
Which gives you the right to get your verse played
I almost lost that after the third grade
Cause on the first and fifteen before I stayed
My team was the first to get paid
So why would you cross us in the first place
Unless you willing to catch a first case
You better all go on on your first date
To see if you can get past first base
This the first taste of what the pain gave me
You listen to the rumors you would think they played me
But they my juniors, my first babies
I only deal with presidents like the first lady
Who pay me on a first name basis
I don’t like you niggas I’m almost racist
That’s why I’m cursing the first person or cursing the first person who didn’t make my first purchase
But type my name in they word searches
Cause I kill the flow bring out the first hearses
And this will be the first crime you ever seen
But it’s cool cause there’s a first time for everything

Before the ink dried and the deal was finalized
And the money changed hands and the plan was monetized
We used to eat mcdonalds fries
Shop for economy size
Know when economists lie
We poor we trying to survive
Another stat-istic of a man with some kind of pride
I’m getting black listed like I’ve got a communist tie
Little did I know it was myself I was trying to find
Getting all kind of high
Crashing like vehicular homicide
But now I’m self employed and I’m chilling
I’m waking up with the millionaires
You looking for the building I’m still in there
Still in fear
Scared of the dark that don’t matter
When the lights come on the cockroaches scatter
Exposing the data
Yo get a load of these actors
They cloak and dagger
See how I broke they swagger
My spirit is rich
Yea the lyrics is sick
Get prepared lyricist of the year in this bitch
Embed
Yeah
Yo...let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why
This nigga...why we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
Cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects
With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off
Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy
Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun
Like, I used to serve that bitch, c'mon
Really really good, I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack ass nigga...

Wack niggas...I don't even like to be around 'em
Give 'em dap or pound 'em
See 'em out, they houndin' dawg
Sayin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Sayin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
Nigga I'm nasty, my style is sound porn
The graphic, exposin' wack asses
I emcee as free as Ol' Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin' to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldn't be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K

The pastor say we goin' to mass today

I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskay had them girls feelin' friskay
You was with mey, she said "Who's the sissay?"
And even if they did wanna get bizzay
Freaky like Missay and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you would fuck up a free lunch, dawg
Just keep it right thurr like Chingay
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gay
Spanish girls tell ya "No hable ingle"
And everbody wanna run to me for they single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself

(Wack nigga) Wake up in the morning dawg, and you a
(Wack nigga) I'd kill myself if I was that
(Wack nigga) Everything you wear and rock, is just

(Wack nigga) You can't do it dawg, you's a
(Wack nigga) Bitin' ass, bitch ass, trick ass
(Wack nigga) Even your daughter says "My daddy's a - "
(Wack nigga - You wack nigga!)
You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you
That's how you know ya flow is weak
Cuz you only got them there to 'Say Yes' like Floetry
The clique that I oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry
You're the place you're supposed to be
You ain't ain't comin' close to me
It ain't that you underrated
It's more that you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldn't get the clearances
For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is, Murder, Death, Kill
But you never shot nothin', never have, never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems

In the beginnin', God created man in his own image
I'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish
Kweli handle his business, niggas don't forget it
Cause a wiseman can choose to get ignorant with it
Na'mean - you all can get it, I'm conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin' that shit like, "You hold a gat, right?"
The trip you on must be short cause you pack light - act right
You got it twisted, tellin' niggas that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now, you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen Ive
Start speakin' Nuwaubian and followin' Malachi
Or anything but rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all ya'll fuckin' the game up
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'mma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got boy!
Not that I'm wildin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!

I don't...
Remember the first time I heard Kweli
I don't remember what I was doing
There were no remembered witnesses to my doings
But it seems like I've known him, forever
He who has, moved through mornings and midnights
Through, deaths and dawns
To document our bones our blood our lives
Listen, listen to his exact wings
Strumming mists from clouds
Listen, listen a man always punctual with his, mouth
Listen to his, revolution of syllables
Scoping lightning from his pores
Keeping time, with his hurricane beat
Asking us to pick ourselves up and become thunder

Yeah, they say you can't please everybody...
Let's go! Yeah, ay, they ain't know what that sound like
Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat
Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
On your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat

Yo, what becomes of a dream deferred
That never makes it to the world to be seen or heard
Do it breathe? Do it got a heartbeat? Is it alive?
Do it leave only to become a star in the sky?
I believe, no scratch that I know, this ain't my full potential
Only usin' 10 percent of my mental on instrumentals
But incidentally my, energy heavenly
Can he be so ill there ain't no, pill or no remedy
The maker of memories posess the recipe to your fate
Make no mistake there ain't no escapin' your destiny
Especially when, 'til death do us part, like wedding rings
I'll be here forever, put that on e'rything

Your Alpha and your Omega, your beginning and your end
Your father, your brother, your lover, your friend
The blood in your vein that gets spilled and, runs in the drain
That's right my flow one and the same, the joy and the pain
My name, the burner that destroy the toy and the train
All city all night I'm enjoyin' the fame
I'm a hustler, I'm a gangster and a rebel with the rank of a general
In the battle between God or the Devil
I lay claim to your spirit, your religion, your belief system
I'll do your hittin', your catchin' and your relief pitchin'
This kid proficient in, every position
The man of your dreams and your nightmares commandin' your vision
'Til it's quite clear like light beer, yeah I'm standin right here
I get you hot but stay cooler than the night air
I try to fit it in the same rhyme
But realize, I can't be everything to everyone at the same time

You're everything, man
You're everything, man
First time I heard him, I was in Japan
Seems like the first time I heard him was like, the Reflection, Reflection Eternal
Like when Kanye came out I guess was when I started to listen, I hate to say that but
New York native, and serious Talib fan
I came all the way from Puerto Rico just to see Talib Kweli
Him, Mos Def all of them man, I need them out here in my life
It's a rainy morning in New York CityEmbed
Ready or not

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)

Hell (word)

Every Sunday dressing up catching gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all God's children, then what's the word of the reverend worth?
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in God's image, then that means his face is mine
Wait or it's that blasphemy it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father, then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally that's confusion to a young'n tryna follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus, then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James? And why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible?
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say that's where you go when you die
But how they know?

I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, it was a blessing, not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth, word
Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and that's where them crazy baldheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
That's why when they say one is right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that ain't vein to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who looking for God knowin' to go inside
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)

Living in mass confusion, looking for absolution
The gas seducin' and psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
Religion create division, make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew, make the rules of faith
That you condition to and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well
Momma say it's her after me
Preacher say it's blasphemy
I say there's gotta be a better explanation
This dance is just me and you
I pray to God, here's you
Take one look at your rear view
And you can see what I see
That could only mean

We know (hey)
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell
Hell
Hell
Hell

The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd don't mean I gotta be no sheep
You feel me?
More blood is spilled over religion than anything in world history
We saying the same thing

The way you move your body got 'em stiff like a hieroglyph
I watched you dance across the floor to the title track
You 'bout to get me "Off The Wall" like you Michael Jack'
I make a scribe in your beauty my sacred duty
I will write a song, write a book, write a play, make a movie

The White voice you use on the phone when you handle business
I love it when you freaky (Yeah)
I love when you a lady
Rockin' door knockers from the late 80s, raisin' babies
I love her; god bless you
Your body somethin' special
I love to play connect the dots with your facial freckles
No need for fashion policin' because I love your style
Whatever happen to Shenice, baby I love your smile
I might be fallin' in love, should I let her know
A pimp told me if I love her I should let her go
I sing her praises every time they play this instrumental
Cause she instrumental to my life, to my life, to my--

This here is a special dedication
To all the special ladies
Shout-out to will.i.am
Yeah, holla at me3Embed
Yeah, as a kid growin up in Brooklyn, my pops was a DJ
He had a bunch of records - funk, jazz, rhythm and blues, soul
There was this one gospel record I liked like, like
Like holy moly, I might get some religion and leave you holy holy
Yeah, this rhyme is so fat it's roly poly
I give you intimate details so you can get to know me
These corporate rappers like "Why this dude pickin on me?"
You rap your way to the top, but now it's gettin lonely
Kids is hungry and you lookin like a steak from Nick & Toni's
But don't nobody want your jewels, cause your shit is phony
Say word? Your shit is real? Damn, your shit is corny
My rhymes turn a new page like Mark Foley
And touch kids like when Larry Clark gave the part to Chloe
Rest in peace to Harold Hunter, the greatest from New York
Started out skatin for Zoo York
Word hangin out at The Gavin, I was very lucky
To talk to Rash' once I got past Derek Dudley
Got him on "Respiration", that's pre-Badu
Bet you Garnett Reid got a Matt Doo tattoo
Sometimes I feel like I'm drownin I gotta tread water
Head above the water I always remember Headquarters
Heads up, eyes open, I got my mind focused
I find hope inside a line, my rhymes define opus
Sometimes hopeless people, fill my thoughts with evil
My record so hard it broke the needle
At the Mixtape Awards niggas act like they don't give a fuck though
And disrespect the legacy of Justo
What the blood claat? No, let the blood flow
You ain't come to pay your respect, then what you come fo'?
Too many good niggas die, it's like a stop loss
Hood niggas ghetto like fried wings and hot sauce
How you hard? The cops lettin 50 shots off
Baby Jay-Z's with the knockoff Scott Storch beat
You are not Short, you are not Katt
You're not a player or a pimp, money stop that
Learn to master your speech and be eloquent
Rappers keep peddlin sweets, the beats weaker than gelatin
We used to kick up dust, now we settlin
Rest in peace to Dilla, Weldon, we can't forget you
Professor X and, Proof we miss you, word
Rest in peace to Shaka, twenty one gun salute
In the air like "BLAKA BLAKA BLAKA"
You're still here cause you're livin through me
You're like a gift God has given to me

It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns they back on you {*repeat first two lines 3X*}
It's kind of hard to keep faith in the things that you do
When everybody turns their back...

Yeah I know a city that's surrounded by a beautiful beach
The economy boosted by the drugs they move in the street
More clearer than the crystal sky, blue as the beast
The people ain't got shoes for they feet, or food to eat
So they hurtin but what's for certain you can get you some heat
And over beef you laid to rest like you was gettin some sleep
Where the little kids get ammunition (word) you can't get no nutrition
Or any type of suitable living condition listen
They shoot you over that paper, its just survivalist human nature
To put you out of your misery like euthanasia (yeah)
Don't let them fool you we ain't different than the youth in Asia
Africa and Europe, it's a small world we truly neighbors
If they the third world then who the first to get to heaven
I know it's hard but who does God choose to go through it worst
Usually it's the prophets, ask a cat what really matters
Nowadays usually it's his pockets

Word~! Don't nobody talk no more they all text message
Drivin and typin, not payin attention, missin they next exit
Dependin on navigation they ever know where they goin
They stayin stuck in one spot they not growin
I'm so over cryin, waitin and hopin playin the blame game
The game changed me into +A Different World+ like Dwayne Wayne
I'm gettin high just to maintain (yeah)
Take my music like a drug and drop the needle in the same vein
I get a rush like I'm tweekin off blow
Except it ain't via the nose it's from deep in my soul
The street slang I be speakin in code
Kick in the do's, freakin the flow 'til the speakers explode
We in control, the people know I speak the truth
The power of my roots is thicker than sour sop
And they so strong they bustin out the flower pot
Family tradition is to tell 'em you love 'em
While your family livin from granny in the kitchen the little man in prison


I'm just tryin to get back, to what really matters
I'm tryin to search my soul to find out, what I'm after
But the more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder
So mom and dad don't forget to warn your sons and daughters
About the-na-ture-of, the world today, the nature of the world today
The-na-ture-of, the world today, the nature of the world today

Yeah, it's all natural baby
It's how we put it there
Yeah, Brooklyn to Tennessee
You goin up with me
Yeah, yeah, break it downEmbed
You left me
Yes! Welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli
Left me in a lonesome
Ladies...

I got you in the mood (Yeah), for a interlude
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude
But let's stop talking, 'cause it's feelin like an interview
I know you're into me, so, let me get into you
I'm always in the mood for laughing and loving
And rapping and fucking
And passing the dutch and relaxing and puffing
And hitting and ducking the ripping production
These kittens ain't muffins just because we stuff 'em in the oven
My words is dripping off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks
Dude, get a clue, like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick
They holding hands with these dudes like they going steady, but
One glimpse, and I know they ready—you already know
Slipped her a note like, "You ready to go?"
We make a getaway plan, and we head for the door, let's go

I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars (C'mon)
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars (Y-Y-Yeah, yeah)
Navigate through the truly bizarre (Yeezy, uh-uh)
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life (Uh-uh)
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight (Woo!)

Is this a Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like
Just like, I'm the shit (In the mood)
Ugh! You ain't figured out what I'm about yet
Always rockin that "This-ain't-out-yet"
But this ain't 'bout that
From a city where niggas plug like outlets
Far as music go, yo, it ain't no outlets
So, when I go out, niggas always out to get me in the studio
And I ain't in the mood to flow
I'm with my girl, and I'm tryin to hit the movies, yo
And they tryna act stupid—oh!
In the club with Silicon Suzie
What happened to real girls, like Rudy?
With real titties like Tootie
This girl got a silicon booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now, I ain't tryna judge like Judy
But bitch, you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like 50—throw her in a pool, G!
I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars (Yeah)
Navigate through the truly bizarre (Uh-uh uh, uh)
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight

Break it down, uh!
What?
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Yeah!
D-D-D-D-D-D-nn-wha!
D-D-D-D-D-D-nn-wha!

Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum
'Cause see, they wanna breed cursing for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmastime choice for what? No, we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun
Completely done with rap dudes, don't compete with the dumb
I spill my blood for my people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Donte and Main Flow
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bojangles-ass dudes
Dancin around the club, doin the tango
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight

Wow, that's a nice track!4Embed
Kweli!

Won't you stay around with me?...
And please say the rhyme
Cause these rappers think that I'm
In love with your state of mind
Cause you a favorite of mine
And I know you on your grind
I don't want to waste your time
But baby won't you stay around with me?...
And let my love (and let my love)
And let my love

Kweli you should rap about this, you should rap about that
Any more suggestions? You in the back, yeah you
You should rap more on beat, you should rap more street
And never ever get your mack on please, how bout you?
I like the way you're melodic, it's cause you capture hypnotic
Portraits and seem to make the average exotic
Kweli you nice, I know you getting some love, but you can't spit like a thug
And you a blow, you make a hit for the club, word
I don't like your voice, I don't like your choice of beats
It sounds like it's forced, and what was up with "Back Up Offa Me"?
I ain't like that, now you should get with Hi-Tek
Now he got nice tracks, them other dudes is type wack
Yeah, people keeping it coming, I keep it bubbling
Like the heat from oven boiling the water and the hate
So they light my fire...
I got a mic empire, my own label
I had to Emancipate Mimi like Mariah...
At some point I might retire, on some bullshit
My legacy, horseshit like Mariah's...
Illest flow found in the game, soothing like the sound of the rain
It's the dude profound with the fame, I refusing to be sounding the same
Keeping the verses, deleting the curses, defeating the purpose
When the people go on strike, I'm in the street with the workers
Speaking the words from a pulpit like the preachers at churches
Raise my hand, all the teachers get nervous
Cause they know I air them out
And they ain't even really gotta hear me out
Keep it dirty like Pigpen, voice in the warrior's head like Lynne Thigpen
Clocking like Big Ben, old school slang still find a way to innovate
Pete Rock got em feeling great, the ladies say

But baby won't you stay around with me?...
And let my love (and let my love)
And let my love

Light the tip of the L, this heavyweight rap tipping the scale
And we never let the system prevail, real picturesque, missing the sale
Never that, it's forbidden like Afghani sisters lifting the veil
I'm still leading the pack, these cats lacking
Just because you be having a dragon don't mean you got the fire...
It ain't nothing to play with, it's sacred
My pen is the paintbrush, and dipping in paint plus
Truth, love, joy, anger, hatred and anguish
That's the spectrum of colors I paint with
I don't feast at the banquet cause freedom is the set that I bang with
Listen the conditions in my Slum Village is Tainted
I grew through the pavement, like the flower the girl drew in the paper
The sky bluer and the obvious save you
The rules of engagement that they use, attitudes of a slave
Man got me stressed out losing my patience
The moves that I'm making across waters
Through contraband that I'm taking across borders
Information never lost in translation
Too many new words to be learned, I'm spitting fire giving third degree burns
Giving them heat stroke, hotter than rocking a peacote
At Venice Beach though, all these rappers soup like miso, we go
Back in the days like reminiscing with Pete yo
Ladies welcome to the Kweli show
She goes...
Won't you stay around with me?...
And please say the rhyme
Cause these rappers think that I'm
In love with your state of mind
Cause you a favorite of mine
And I know you on your grind
I don't want to waste your time
But baby won't you stay around with me?...
And let my love (and let my love)
And let my love

Ladies and Gentleman, its Talib Kweli
Yeah, this Ear Drum y'all
B-B-B-B-Banging on your ear drum
We got the incredible Pete Rock on the track like...
I like that, I like that
I want to give an extra big shout to my man Dave Dart
Holding me down as always and as usual
And his new born son, Cannon, brand new to the world
He's now down with Blacksmith, Blacksmith is the movement
Jean Grae, Strong Arm Steady gang, Talib Kweli
It's what it is, yeahEmbed
I'm freestyling, for me, myself and I
I write them on the paper til it gets sky high
I say goodbye, to all the bad things I've done
I start a new beginning, and this is how it begun
From, KRS-One to Talib Kweli
Now I'm the best superstar on BET
And MTV, better yet I'm known universally
I am the key, to being the best MC
The prophecy, the one and only
A timeless masterpiece, I ain't the least
I'm the best, cause God said so
I'm just trying to express my lyrical flow

Yo, yo
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
It feel good, it feel so damn, uh
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
It feel good, yo, yo, yo
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
Baby tell me how it feel when I always keep it real
It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
Yo, now how it feel? Yo

It feel good, it feel so damn good, it feel
Khalil brought the fly shit, I brought the hood appeal
Notes from the piano is falling out the sky
Like angels losing their wings so they see how it feel to cry
Babies have babies for the welfare coupons
Dudes on the radio rapping, them cats is lukewarm
I get up on it, spit up on it like a new born
The family structure ruptured, there's living proof like a group home
B-Boy being a man, throw a suit on
Stepping out hotter than Tuscon when the soup's on
My son like, "Daddy, I be missing you when you gone"
I said I gotta go so I can stack chips like Lou Corn
I ask my daughter how I look, she fixed my hat so I can wear it cool
Cause she's like "That's what they wear in school"
Then she asked me "Daddy, you know any superstars?"
I looked at her and said "Stop being silly, that's what you two are"
I say it now and I've said it before
And you can trust me on this cause I've been through it, y'all
Follow your heart and you can do it dog
Baby you're a star...

All of the days...
All of the days, of my life I spent on trying to find
Yet another way to show you how, how special you are
There ain't no body, that can take that away from you
No matter what...
Even though...

Yeah, yo, yo, yo
And even though mummy and daddy might fight all through the night
Argue and fuss, you a part of us that we've got to get right
I don't love you to death, cause I love you to life
And you a teenager, you might not want my advice
You might be full of spite, think you're grown, still a tyke
And say things that cut like a patient under the knife
I say this, cause I was once a teenager too
And respect for my peers is really all that I related to
But I made it through, you gonna make it too
So much I wanna say to you...

Baby you a star, that's what you are to me
You know I can tell? Cause you a part of meEmbed

I live above the rim and pay the full
Like my nigga what crack his ho
Niggas wish we all wish a nigga would crack a joke
Like he want to battle for the mic
This is Brooklyn, the planet
Y'all niggas is like satellites revolve around my every word
I address the crowd like Lincoln at Gettysburg
Surrounded by the heavy herb
The crowd is more or less wall to wall here's for the pure
Hip-Hop how, I'm rocking got them dropping they jaw
Fire marshall blocking the door
Does he crack like he chopping the Raw
This is the shit the cops is stopping us for
This is the rain of the tek and the motherfuckers be nuts
Slice like nip tuck, specialize in deep cuts
It's the music that you riding to
Provided to you by Kweli and Hi-Tek the livest two

The less a devil's got a grip
I get it loose we gotta slip away the ghetto yea
More for a dollar, more fresh goods for purchase
Less liquor stores
Less churches that be looking like corner stores
More rap songs that stress purpose
With less misogyny less curses
Let's put more depth in our verses 'til they left on the surface
While we stomp through the underground
The calm don't come around
You sort of hoping for that refection, you sort of open
I'm a heathen call 'em chosen
I don't play with your emotion
Stop acting so god damn emotional
I give you these bars free like it's promotional
This ain't no marketing strategy
It had to be from the heart in order to be reality
Reflection (What we need? What we need)
More love
Less hate
More real
Less fake
More grind
Less wishing
Less stunting

Come on
Yeah
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody who been ridin' with me so far
It's been a long journey
But they say your life's path is not about the destination, it's all about the journey
I appreciate y'all

It's my blood, sweat, tears, years of struggle, love, hate, fear
New York City, you can make it here you can make it anywhere
I came prepared for the rain, hail, sleet, snow
Whatever the weather, we ride, let my people go
To the place where knowledge is born
We walkin' in the third eye of the storm, check it out

Futuristic lyricist, straight from the renaissance
Top of the supper chain, rap's upper echelons
My people sufferin', slave to another chain
This voyage is maiden, like my mother other name
Is this your first trip to hell? We venture capitalists
If it's a product, then we got it for sale
When I first started to spell, my words fell into rhymes
Turned into songs, everything else fell into line
I painted pictures you could see, the people bleed in my bars
When I was a teen I was mean, about to reach for the stars
So if I fell, I fell right in the cloud, tighten the valve
Niggas is watered down, used to be no bitin' allowed
Now they gangstas, no cryin' allowed
You probably see a fight on the stage before you see a fight in the crowd
I send this out to my people facin' the storm, homie, we ridin' it out
You inspire what I'm writin' about

We walk into the third eye of the storm, check it out
It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
Check it out (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Check it out (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Check it out (Ha, ha, ha)
We ain't fuckin around (Uh, uh)

I'm not a judge, but I'm handin' out sentences
For political prisoners, and regular inmates with no visitors
Niggas in the street outside the reach of the ministers
Not those that say "Spiritual," but actual partitioners
Rap listeners who be openin' Black businesses
This underground shit with samples that lack clearances
Once you get past appearances, you can tell whose shit is fake
Or whose shit is based on past experience
You really been to war hand to hand like crack sales
Building man to man, they tryna kill off the black male
Females left to raise up her son, from the day he was one
'Til he twenty and he raise up a gun
And get to blazin' for his place in the sun
The smoke grazin' his lung, young in his years and he facin' a ton
None of his peers wanna share the role of child care provider
But they'll hit a nigga blunt and share saliva
You ain't a rider and you hustlin' backwards
Too many equate success with imitating these crackers
So our kids lookin' up to drug dealers and rappers
We takin' all the work away from the Black actors
Revelation is first and Armageddon is after
Tsunamis and hurricanes, natural disasters
The fast food culture, speed is always a factor (Come on)
Instant gratification, they want the cash faster
It's my blood, sweat, tears, years of struggle, love, hate, fear
New York City, you can make it here you can make it anywhere
I came prepared for the rain, hail, sleet, snow
Whatever the weather, we ride, let my people go
To the place where knowledge is born
We walk into the third eye of the storm, check it out

It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
It's the third eye of the storm
It's the place where knowledge is born
Check it out (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Check it out (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Check it out (Ha, ha, ha)

+The Lord Chief Rocka+ I'm colder than meatlockers
My people keep throwin it up like cheap vodka
I smack internet MC's and beat bloggers
You can see my +Black Thought+ like 'Riq Trotter
It's deep, go ahead and sleep, they know in the street
Kwe' gon flow on the beat proper composin complete operas
Longer than a cigar that's Godfather
Tappin' two heart chakras, I'm harder than Gobstoppers
People comin for the throne not knowin the seat hotter
Than fish grease, criminal names on police blotters
You convinced me, I hit targets like top shotters
Out in the mideast like Muslims takin Shahada
I'm sayin makin' a profit, a product of Reaganomics
Awake and I'm stayin conscious to radio playin garbage (yeh!)
Blacksmith Music, if you don't pay homage
I'mma show you how we break an artist
That's a threat, I'm not makin a promise
Speak to the people like Barack Obama
They worship like the black Madonna, c'mon
Niggas talk shit, but they ain't got skills
I'm the type of nigga to put lead in your grill
Number two pencil is sharper to bruise mentals, and
Beatin in my chest is the heart of a true gentleman
Still spit right in your face
Fuck a Top 8, back up, gimme my space, you're not safe

Fuck with your man too, thinkin' I can't do what I plan to
Vet vandal, niggas are brand new

Get ran through like you was fingers through Sassoon
Or a chick in the bathroom, off the backstage room
Shit you couldn't imagine, nigga I'll harass you
I'll Ras Kass you, Soul on Ice and body cast dude
Past due, Jean and Kwe' the last two action heroes
Actually had the capacity, to be the ones in a class of zeroes
Hip-hop's not dead, it was on vacation
We back, we bask in the confrontation
You can ask me, have any conversation

We not fallin' for your trick cause your image is like a gimmick
Forget it every rhyme is bitten, you like a mimic
I'm talkin' to the Lord and I'm askin' him for forgiveness
Just for kickin' niggas out the club like Michael Richards
Yeah I admit, I'm guilty, the way I spit is filthy
I keep it gritty so they get it they feel me, the flow
Is known for touchin' the soul of street hustlers
I speak in the language they know I keep customers
The writin' therapeutic, it's due to the pain and sufferin'
While these dudes get it confused and abuse the creative substance
I'm givin you a contact high, my name buzzin'
And I came in the game with nothin', stop frontin' nigga
Talk shit now

The year of the Blacksmith is not defined by any calendar
Just thought I'd remind all you challengers

Hah... what'chu doin?
Throw your hands up, c'mon
 BK to BX and every place in between, it's all 7-18 like
 Grand Concourse, whassup!

We got beats to the rhyme and the rhyme is so fresh yo
So what'chu got? 9's and tecs, you're no threat
It's the beat, how you get your cake don't matter
It takes heart the lyrics been replaced with the swagger
I stay sharp enough to slash your face like a dagger
The actors been replaced with the rappers
The rappers been replaced with the actors, see how they try to stay on the beat
The pig route when he's walking down the street to the beat

WOOP~! Sound of da police
What is the life of a true hip-hopper, the beats
Peace love unity livin proper with the beats
In any endeavor whatever we will prosper with our beats
Some cats are real, other are impostors with beats
We the realest, livest
The rawest, crack cocaine heroin survivors with beats
We avoided the cops, we focused on beefs
Spittin, all we saw was stacks of rhymes written, elite
Way too smart for the system of course
We know a smart, free, black man just pisses 'em off!
What they like is when we glisten and gloss
Flashin millions but still takin a loss
Bump the beat! Yeah, all in the street
Talib yo, I think it's 'bout time to speak

Watch me take it there, life ain't a crystal stair
Hell yeah it's crystal clear when Kweli and Kris is here
Searching for the perfect beat I went to East Dayt'
It's crazy and fugazi how they slaves to they release date
They try to look away, they're scared to look inside
Askin why like a guy who look for God up in the sky (that's right)
Searchin high and low, behind the do', inside the drawer
Little did he know that the beat was tryin to find a flow
Stuck in limbo, how low can you go
A punched hole through your stomach lining like Tylenol
Build all kind of rolled, metaphors and similies
That'll have you doubtin my competitor's abilities
My whole body is a spiritual facility
Where I confess after a lyrical killing spree
The illest delivery, later for the talk we need action
Silence is golden but the violence is platinum
When you rappin to the beat

Boom, bap, who's, that?
KRS-One bring the beat back
The perfect beat we seek that, knowledge of mind we speak that
We don't speak weak crap over weak tracks
MOVE, THAT; we speak boom bap live in the club
We can show and prove that
Yeah, it ain't old school or new school it's true school rap
Beat you 'til you're blue and black, true dat, it's

Better beat win again, work the street
Movin again, insert the heat
Lookin again for the perfect beat
Don't look in the book to learn to eat
Write up a hook, learn to speak
Never be shook, follow the heat
Forever they look weak
T.K. you must speak!

Teachin 'em how to eat to live
They cheap and their pimp is pleadin the fifth
Bleedin as if they goin to war
Everytime they leavin the crib
Sneakers and whips, police be peepin the strip
You see 'em walkin the beat
Hoes believin the pimps who eatin the shrimps
So John's walkin the street
Lookin for a sweet face, in each case
Tryin to get they heartbeat racin, and the dark meat be tastin
So delicious, my description so good to the beat
It's lifted right from the sounds that you hear in the hood when you sleep
Bring the beat back!
All that whackness, we don't need that
You gotta bring the beat back!
All that whack garbage, we don't need that
Bring the beat back! All that weakness we don't need that
Selector bring the beat back, bring the beat back!
Selector, listen!

Yeah, DJ Rhettmatic

Can't hold your mic, like your liquor, your style like an Amstel
Smack a nigga 'til my motherfuckin hands swell
You ain't fly and you prolly got canceled
Y'all niggas shaky like handheld, amateur camera work
In walking this planet of earth
I'm the illest emcee and a man of my word
When I came out, niggas didn't understand it at first
I'm known to roll up my sleeves and put my hands in the dirt
We at war and I got a battle plan that can work
With the proper execution, so I'm killin' the mic

Rhymes so bright the sunshine beams to it
Stop haters in their tracks like high beams, watch the movement
You was at the crime scene screaming "I ain't do it," but

Martin Luther King had a dream to it, people cling to it

Wack niggas get passed over so much they seem Jewish
Better leave and do it now or seem foolish
This music, I bleed to it, I raise my seeds to it

I'm blowing they minds wide open when I'm flowing divine

Amani Fela, Diani Eshe, I'ma hold y'all down for real (Got you)

It was 1996, 4th of July, looking off in the sky
Dealing with thoughts inside, when something caught my eye
It was a silhouette of a beautiful woman, bright with life
Carrying my first seed, looking like she gone bear fruit tonight
We at the African street festival, and she walking around
Talking about the midwife, said that bring the baby down
I'm about to be a father, the sights and sounds seem brighter around me
And for starters, I know I'ma work harder, word
We got home at three in the morning, I was beat
Them contractions started coming as soon as I fell asleep
3:05, like every five minutes, then the water broke
We ought to go, yelling at the cabbie, 'cause he's sort of slow
You know them hospitals all trying to get paid, no questions
Here come the doctor's with they drugs, trying to do c-sections
But my baby stays strong, in labor for yay long
Eight-pound baby boy, to carry my name on, joy

Say, dog, that shit's real (That's the sound of joy, y'all)
Huh, Kweli, yo, I know how you feel
Kweli, yo, I know how you feel (My baby girl)

June 10th, 1999, I been on the grind
Since the birth of my son, it's been about way more then rhymes
Baby on the way, my lady glowing today
At least that's what the midwife said on the phone, anyway
The music got me going away like every day
But it's a blessing, so I gotta have patience (True)
And she got pregnant on a Jamaican vacation
So it's all good, this time we'll have the baby in the house
I went the hospital route, I know what they all about (Never again)
So I'm out on tour in Baltimore
Get the call around four when the water hit the floor (Damn)
I gotta rock my show, but I gotta go
Got second thoughts about her not going, to the hospital
I left the show early, Mos held me down, good looking (No doubt)
Call the car service like, "Take me straight to Brooklyn" (Uh-huh)
Got the news in the car, stayed sorta calm
But I cried tears of joy, when they put my daughter in my arms, how precious!
Uh, uh, said I know how you feel
Uh, said I know how you feel when— (My precious joy)
Uh, uh, uh, said I know how you feel
Uh, Kwel, I know how you feel (Uh, I know you do, uh, my precious joy, y'all)
Said I know how you feel (Yeah)
Said I know how you feel (My precious joy)
Let me know how you feel (Uh)
Said I know how you feel

I do it for the seeds y'all, in they formative years when they need y'all
We gotta believe in what we conceive, y'all, it's deep, y'all
I give them the truth, so they approach the situation with ammunition
I keep nothing away, they hear everything 'cause they know how to listen
Teach 'em the game so they know they position
So they can grow and make decisions that change the world and break old tradition
They put kids in jail for a life they ain't even get to start
That's murder too, and it's breaking my heart, it's breaking our nation apart
We gave the youth all the anger, it's just
We ain't taught them how to express it and so it's dangerous
You can't talk to 'em unless your language is relating to what they going through
So busy ignoring 'em, you can't see what they showing you
And you wonder why we called baby daddies and baby mamas
When we grow up, we can't act like adult mothers and fathers, yo
I'm so blessed to have a boy and a girl
Every day they bring joy to my world
Huh, yeah, I know how you feel
Kweli I know how you feel (It's the sound of joy)
My brother Kwel, I know how you feel
Brother Kwel, I know how you feel (Baby girl, my precious joy)
Kweli, I know how you feel
Said, Kwel, I know how you feel (Fela, you my joy, yo)
Huh, and if you know how it really feel
Let 'em know, they know how you— yo (Yo)

I do it for the seeds, y'all, uh, uh, yeah, hahaha

New year, new record, time to do bigger shit
Caught a plane to Cali linked with my nigga Quik
I figure with the combination we bomb the nation but stay calm and patient
As the world get hyped from hearin our musical conversation
This a beautiful situation right here
Givin' birth on the track 'cause the cypher stay pregnant with ideas
And we rockin it, rock, rock, rockin' it
Tell the hater players put a sock in it
Proper shit, that you got to get, 'cause we properly document
How cats look more like dicks than the Washington Monument
Validly try to challenge me, but who you racin wit'
It's amazing the lyrical lingerie I be lacin shit, we be blazin it
Put it in the air with the chronic
My lyrics like drugs, got you hooked on my phonics

Writin' rhymes in my captain's log, BlackStar date
MC's fake like Egyptian gods in Stargate
Lovin the hate, bubble all types of weight in they rap
I draw blood like mosquitos y'all annoy like gnats
Pop that around the wrong cat, get laid flat
Concrete adjust to the contours in your back
Quik, where you at?

Yo, I'm in the back room makin' a run
Ain't even touched during makin' her cum
And you can catch me out in Portland with Stoudamire
Everybody doin' shows but I'm the hottest flyin'
Bitches say honest, I swear to God
So how come then believin' her is so damn hard?
Could you really blame a nigga if I fucked and skate?
You ain't even pay, that's why you flunked the date
All you did was eat salad, talk shit about niggas and drink wine
And your answer kept changin' 'cause bitch, you keep lyin'
Talkin 'bout "He make me sick
"All he do is disrespect me, keep callin' me bitch"
"And he only wanna fuck me when he off of that dope"

Hype niggas make girls be like "Get off me, stop"

'Cause the game unorthordox, off top
You got cold feet like I pulled off your socks
Always goin' downtown pullin' all the stops
Your breath smellin' like fish from straight off the docks
That's how you lost your spot
You too hype
If you got a spliff then put it in the air
If you want a rift then put it in the air
If you shakin yo' ass, put it in the air

Music is the air I breathe, the prayer I lead
Rippin' in the atmosphere, up there in the breeze
It's stronger than the revolution that you wear on your sleeve
It's all I know, not an idea you believe
I spit bars you can't touch like tits in strip bars
Get charged, man, I drop hits that hit hard
Hit bars with my brown sugar sister
The night just start, I'm waitin' for the DJ to— (Let your body rock)
We all hop in the car deep, we bring Brooklyn to the city
My fellas lookin' sharp, my ladies is lookin' pretty

Boppin' and my people got it poppin' like needle marks
Three o'clock and it's mass hysteria, 'bout to hit the Cafeteria

Vampires takin' a bite

Makin' it right for the fam
It's so tight in the jam, a fight began
You always hear about niggas tried to act like a man
The DJ had the mic in his hand, like, "Calm down" (Let your body rock)
Yeah, it was like I was the audience at your concert
You at the converse with a Louis Vuitton purse
Tiger's eye around the wrist with the fly and the prints
Snakin' up your arm, and blendin' where the tattoo begin
I had to catch a plane, but you make me wanna stay
I had to catch your name and I'm—

'Cause they ain't intentional, it's still the same old song
So just pound your hands together 'til they make that sound
Stop that bouncin' heavy 'til my ends is found
Yeah, hot fun in the summertime, Sly said it
Guys see the flesh, they catch a thigh fetish
Honeys smellin' too sweet, it's like I'm diabetic
More stars and the sky, in the seminar, dianetic
Drop the top, beat up the block
On Flatbush Ave where they smokin' tree up
And shots greet the new tunes
Dogs are loose, hollerin' at the new moon for hours
I'm like the sun, your flower in full bloom
When I come out the house, we complete like the number nine
Give me some of yours, I'ma give you some of mine
Knew off the sucka rhyme, the song, it sound like one of mine
I know you love it when I shine, waitin' for—

You can hear it in my voice when I ask you if you comfortable
Look how love do, I'd practice the Art of War for you like Sun Tzu
Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do
If you black out and collapse, I want to help you to come to
Notice I haven't yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through and make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
You're everything, send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet music'll start, I want you to be the muse for my art
When people try to rip us apart, we gotta work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather
This is my wish list, what I want, not what I need, there's a difference
These days I'm learnin' that words got power, so I'ma be specific

No one to hold 'em while they growin'
They livin' moment to moment without a care in the whole world
Now, if I could help it, I tell it just like it is
And I may say some things that you don't like to hear
I know that, that people lie, people kneel
People die, people heal
People steal and people shed tears
What's real? Blood spills, gun kill, the sun still rise
Above me, trust me, it must be morning time
Wake up, the stakes up

Let's go

I get lonelier each time
You go away, I lose my mind
I lay awake 'til you come and make things right (Yeah, yeah)
I get lonelier each time you go away (Come on)
So, baby, won't you stay with me tonight? (Yeah)

Check it out
There's this lady I'm in love with (Yes, there is)
Living inside this woman I know
But she's scared to let her show
I know it sound like some bug shit (Yeah, it do)
It's just she come with
Hang-ups and insecurities that gotta go
She always nervous around me
But see, this lady inside
She's ready to be my baby tonight
And ever since this lady found me
This woman think I'm dangerous
And ain't ready to put her safety aside
I try to tell her that I got her back
And no matter where we at in our lives
I'll treat her like she my girl
I asked her, "What's wrong with that?" (What's wrong with that?)
She like, "It just ain't right
There's so many more women than men in the world"
I have to admit the girl got a point (True)
Maybe my ambition's made to make me want something I just can't have
So now it's time for me to blow this joint
I still know I'm in love
I just stay focused and true to my path, word

I got to get away
Ladies, you ever felt thrown away
By your man asking "Baby, won't you stay?"
He chilling with his crew
He should be building with you
He got you feeling the blues
'Cause the children the glue
But he willing to do whatever it takes to save 'em
From a fate he can't see when he misbehaving
Brave men don't let they ladies raise they children theyself
You so busy tryna save 'em that you killing yourself
With the stress and strife and the fights and the advice
From the ladies of the night who can't run they own life
Up in your air, nothing is fair, why do you care?
Why do you always take it there? The crying, the tears
You ain't prepared for the jewels that I'm trying to share
You lyin' there dying inside, hot in the fear
The writing is clear on the wall for you to read the sign
Ayo, divine is the way we design, you'll be fine, but still
I get lonelier each time (I get so lonely)
You go away, I lose my mind
I lay awake' til you come and make things right (Make it right, make it right, make it right)
I get lonelier each time you go away (Come on)
So, baby, won't you stay with me tonight?

Yo, you can tell when people wanna spend they life together
Despite the weather, treat each other like a treasure
Can't fight forever, you got to give it up
I ain't got a lot of time, we gotta live it up
I make my music like I make my love
People use it like they take they drugs
In the morning when they waking up (Wake up)
This music got me out late, but
I'll holla at you when I'm done, don't stay up
Will love play with us? It sting like paper cuts
Doused in alcohol, but if it's real, there ain't no greater rush
I got faith in us, it's only you who really know me
I be surrounded by people and still feel lonely
So, baby, won't you stay? (Why won't you stay?)

Back up off me you had your glory
Man I never seen a sadder story
Blame yourself you mad at me you mad at Corey
I left the maze you still the white mice in the laboratory
Don't test the brain son, I'm quite nice at Scattergories
Metaphors and allegories speakin at your colleges
Pathologies I keep my ghetto promises, I promise this
The rhyme'll leave you bloody as.. first responders get
You hear em coming with the sirens of titans like Kurt Vonnegut
They appetite for dominance rival that of the Ottoman
Phenomenon, I'll eat you after dark like this was Ramadan
Ain't no patience for the whack emcee

Rebellion is my specialty
While the mad cows convince you to invest in beef
I play this game without a referee so there ain't no official
So even Too $hort couldn't "Blow the Whistle"
Oh yeah I flow a little! You mighta heard of me
Producers got restrainin orders.. I murder beats
State of emergency like Dudus Coke
You hate it but you love it though
We smoke and roll one up a double Dutch but I ain't jumpin rope
My gutter flow, ice cold like the love below
Bring the hood right into your bungalo
Teach you how to start, ironically bionic Lee Majors
Now you can do us a favor and stop your coonish behavior
You rude as Judas who was an intruder truly a hater
Stab your neighbor in the back, you'll do anything to be famous
Stop posin for the camera, I'm showin all you amateurs

I shine a light through the darkness when the night is black as Yaphet Kotto
All these rappers lookin mad in photos
Saddest player braggadocio quality make up for what I lack in promo
You say you blast a fo'-fo' (nah) you don't shoot
It's more like you shot me an e-mail but forgot to attach the vocals
Call 'em a bastard like their dad a no show
I'm too fast for slowpokes, runnin on the track with Yohji Yamamoto's
This ain't fashion rap, I'm bringin the passion back
Find me where the trouble at, that's my natural habitat
(Let's go~!) I take it with me in the booth
To the livin we owe respect, to the dead we only owe the truth
So if somebody feelin disrespected
Even when his face is smilin, his heart rate escalate to violence
Look at them tremble, jugglin drugs
Using abusing beautiful strugglin, still we usually bubblin

So turn it up loud, and turn it up now
Turn it up loud, turn it up now

Welcome to my hood where the rainbows is in the gutters
The pain that you will discover is makin the angels shutter
There's sex in the city but we never claimed to love her
I know you heard of us, we more murderous than Cain famous brother
Living with death smokin blunts with the Grim Reaper
Snitch niggas known to blow the whistle like a gym teacher
This gum flapper, swear he a gun clapper
Nah; somethin backwards, he really a dumb rapper
He trapped on the corner with the oil spillin
Mixed with the dirt and the water collected in the gutter 'til the color's brilliant
I paint pictures so legendary; I BEEN doin this
Your history is as short as the month of February
In a leap year - what do we fear?
Dead bodies lyin on the ground, nuttin to see here
To be clear, don't ever cross me like police lines
Cause libertarians will be not invited to tea time

Now when I whip around a building it form a corner tornado
Findin nature in the city, we cover our feet in gators
Bugattis to bodegas, they sellin rotten tomatoes
Stackin chips and I don't mean potato - there go another one
Graduated from quarter waters and Butter Crunch
To tuxedo nice with a gun tucked in his cummerbund
He get it from his momma, he ain't nuttin but his mother's son
She used to get it poppin like bubblegum
Peddlin poison was often better employment
The ghetto destroyin any sense of self she was enjoyin
Survival of the fittest; by any means necessary
Got us callin drug dealers revolutionaries
You say he kill his people, he say I feed my family
And you ain't kickin in, you'll never understand me
You just stand in my way, now you an obstacle
And obstacles end up in the hospital - I'm just sayin


Hey {*8X*} turn it up now

My music represent the change in powers
From now on this thing is ours
Got 'em paintin war instead of paintin flowers
They shower they heroes with praises, while we hangin ours
We bring the drums to the battle cause we bang the loudest
You don't know a thing about it, if you mixing King or Malcolm
Bet you that Kweli the outcome
Album's so hot, that my ghetto chicks is bringin talcum
Whether you sing or shout it
They gave somebody else the crown but I'm the King without it
Your Queen is ridin with me, she's always slidin with me
You can't stop me like the bullets that's inside of 50
They try to diss me but whenever I say "bye", they miss me
You walkin with me or you alien like Mork & Mindy
You talkin with me if they often envy
Take it off the table and the Devil run a label
'Cause the Lord is with me

Or mortal line, bustin at the cops like Mortal Kai
The sort of guy that mortify
These clown ass rappers since 45 live
And you know it man
Hey, if this the cut, I'm the surgeon
Assassinate your character, cast aspersions
You ain't got a verse better than my worst one (worst one)
You ain't got a verse better than my worst one (worst one)
Hey, I know it hurts son
But you against me, a .50 Cal verse a squirt gun
You ain't got a verse better than my worst one
You ain't got a verse better than my worst one

Yo, Sean Price, mad nice, accept that
My worst verse sound like your best rap
Put on your bent plaque, I pay double on trips
I punch you, up in your face and double your lips
This be the dumbest shit I ever wrote
No 2Pac Shakur, just two shots, ya floored
Listen, the gun clapper, the dumb rapper, the young rapper
Dig in your pockets and leave with your funds faster
Fuckin new rap rookies
Get beat to death, New Jack Pookie
Face fucked with the H stuck in your grill
Play tough and get scrapped up in the 'ville
Afro-American minus the afro
Bald-headed American lettin the gat blow
Shut the fuck up before you get hurt son
You ain't got a verse better than my worst one
Hey, if this the cut, I'm the surgeon
Assassinate your character, cast aspersions
You ain't got a verse better than my worst one (worst one)

Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah, we on fire
We gotta call the fire department
Let's go
Yo, yo, yo
I don't know why people try to be live when they not
I gotta blow up they spot so I fly that knot

Yo, I know you like that
You like that!
Yeah, yeah

There's an E! True Hollywood Story for the pluckin' it's ripe
How cats is stuck in purgatory for life
Tryin' to fight the enemy without sight
They in the dark swingin' right to left
Clingin' to the little bit of light that's left
And can't escape the room, you can't escape the tomb
You all wear a mask sometimes, I can relate to Doom
That make the whole world earthquake, shake, and move
The beat create a mood or eat your whole plate of food
You can't come close like an order of protection
That this is myself in the pack was sort of my intention
Slaughter anybody testin' my callin', my profession
Anymore questions will born 'em a lesson
A demonstration of takin' it all the way home
While you stuck at first base and
It's like havin' relations without the penetration
Basically doin' nathin'
You a waste of space and time
Always chasin' mine is how you lost your place in line

I don't know why people try to be live when they not
I gotta blow up they spot so I fly that knot
Yeah, free the radio population
Kweli and Doom the 1-2, the combination
Let's go

About time you heard a rhyme flow with DOOM and Kweli
To catch you with the combo, boom boom, Muhammad Ali
Versus Potsie cursin' Yahtzee at the crap table
Burstin' caps at a Nazi rap label
Oops, a pot of hot tea spilt on the cable
Evaporate an ice grill, read the seeds of Aesop fables
Children, come sit, gather
Face the rapid fire of the super slap shit outta liar
The end
Villain, the champ tramp
Flowin' since they had him holdin' ??? at the Kuumba camp
He cleaned his mask with a shoe mitt
And a little bit of her blue spit
She told him you so stupid
Wiped it off, got dressed and left
Everybody instigating, not just the ref
We can shoot the fire on the dirt ground, rocks out
Live with the worst sound, first round knock out

Yo, let me introduce you to the Blacksmith crew, we makin money
Go to sleep with a dream and we wakin up hungry
It's a new day, stomach is rumblin oh well
I'm like Lloyd Banks stumblin' out of the hotel
Overseas show, I'm catchin the last flight
Really need to go, I'm hungover from last night
Out with Gina and MeLa Machinko, we get silly
Had a ball, 'bout to call a cab like Wet Willie's
When I'm in commuter traffic, I'm never worried or panicked
First class travel, I'm flyin Virgin Atlantic
I'm already checked in, I'm ready to settle in
Going places I've never been, I get my Rosetta in
Rackin up the sky miles and gettin them upgrades
And you hate the only place that you visit is upstate
Don't be mad cause I'm writin this rhyme on my iPad
Don't be sad cause tomorrow I'm catchin the flight back

24/7 love ain't that rough
When your career is your passion, know that ain't enough
So when you hear me rappin, it's like I'm makin love
Banging your eardrum
Slingin that good uhh, takin over the planet
You follow my footprints, now you rollin with the greatest
I'm gettin to know the neighbors, I'm tastin the local flavor
Chicks from the ghetto were richer than Portobello
My life is like a movie, a novel by Paulo Coelho
Or the Steely Dan song about a bottle of Cuervo
Colombian Gold, take a hit for the road
It's givin me a vision like I was lickin a toad
Consider me so blessed like momma bakin a cake
And the kids is lickin the bowl, the image stick in your soul

He's back again for the first day
We gonna do this one a little different
Jean Grae, trying to test the waters with this one
(Where you gonna run?)
Not far
(Where you gonna run?)
Where you gonna go? Jean...

Alright, underground climb up, this a new line up
Niggas fight your way through
If you're not ready to lose, may I suggest that you let us the fuck through
Everybody clap your hands now, tear the walls down
Dance like Rudy Huxtable scoring a touchdown, you know
Hands in the air, knees in, knees out
Drop a little cymbal on them this time, no doubt
Let's go
Alright, ten years deep and my tenure's still deep
My bad I'm sorry I don't like when phrases repeat
I meant that a decade's almost passed since Baseball was released
And I'm struggling still hustling to eat
I must be built with adamantium skin
While y'all motherfuckers where you flushed in
With your heart poking through on your arm stupid
Drop more bombs than on Saddam's house unarmed
My mouth's a weapon I shout like Armguard steppin'
Didn't mean to get loud, no disrepect
But you know the Jean is a threat to your checks
Niggas heart burning no prowl no sec to stop the attack
Ya neck back's gettin hot on every drop on the track
And now I finally got some hate it's good, let it be known
I'll still be here after all this shit is done said and gone
Can't keep running the same formula, I'm imploring ya
To quit fucking the game up, before it fucks all of ya up

Yeah come on, yeah come on

Watch these niggas start to run soon as I hit the track
What get the sack, eyes low like Friskin' cat
My flow get cap throw they gun like official Nas
I'm draftin you niggas hard quick fast like tiptonat
Diamond cut lyrics so sharp the spit split the glass
Your mouth writing a check that you ask and quick to cash
Screaming how you quick to shoot don't even know the screenplay
Niggas rappin black and white, I rap in shades of Jean Grae
Sick of niggas licking boots I pick and choose my battles when I spit the truth it's hot
Let the pride and move the cattle
Y'all don't really want no beef, that's too real you want veal
You baby sheep hanging in the air and tend to raffle me
Me? I don't like the taste this shit's gamey
Like magazines telling lies and starting wars like Dick Chaney
It sucks though they losing they flavor like Now and Laters
When I bust them niggas run for the hills like Al Queda

She lacks delivery - really, nigga?
I pack rap symmetry and send it to ya dorm
Why y'all iggin' me for sure
Jean is synonymous to chivalry
Open doors but I step through first
Test the waters and I pee in them got no network
But now everyone's a rapper and everyone'll shoot you dead
Only lead I strapped with a razor sharp pencil
That could write but it could stab you rapid
It's all ass backwards, you're all mall performers, actors
What tho?, come on let's race to where the cash is
Get mauled like Roy the alter boy
I'll jet through you like a Jet through flight, I'm unemployed
You still cared to touch me, I gotta keeps the rap level
You face screwed ugly
I'm chasing all you club bunnies
And racing you tackle you down
Take your money with your chest on the ground
I know it's foul, what you gonna do now

(I think it's time you gave it up!)Embed
Yeah
Kweli in the house
Dave West is what I'm talkin' about, you know?
Yea yea yea yo yea yo yea yea yea yo yea yo Yea yea yea yooohh yooohh

Make a joy for noise until the lord people are floored
Cause the pen is mightier than the sword
Leavin' the floor
Cause my words cut deeper than a tissue massage
I got hooks and lines that sink y'all like a fisherman's rod
I'm on mission for God he blessed me to spit it this hard
A lot of niggas start shit but they don't finish the job
I'm like Minister Farrakhan or Africans who finished a marathon
The pain in my voice is like Sarah Vaughn
No matter what playin' 'em on I carry on
Even if the dawn lit overhead I carry on
Like Flash Gordon the Scar on my Face is Brad Jordan
Passports splash with blood from the battle I last fought in
I want to cash all in
Or I start breakin' like glass jaw I put The Blast on 'em like my last tourin'
Or fast forward just to catch what I said
Yo I say some shit like that just to mess with your head, come on

Grabbin' the black steel, bowh
In the hour of chaos
We ain't rappin' till they pay us, is that real?
We got babies
We got bills
Put your hands up in the air if you know how I feel
And let it out (let it out)
Get it out (get it out)
Work it up (work it up)
Sweat it out
I don't know
If you know
My history I do it big
You might also likeLike Notorious did
Get on and play like this according to kid
Gangster like knock out Ned like Little Zane slayed all on his wiz
Crazy like the little hand on the seven, the big hand on the six
J-Lo, yo
Whether you all in the mix or if you stay low
Everybody say hoooo hoooo hoooo hoooo

I don't know
If you know
My history you don't know me
Choke the game till it's blue like a varicose vein
And I can't remember the last time I felt this terrible pain
And the whole shit blew up
Was it in vain?
They'll be lookin' through the rubble like they searchin' for Hussein
I'm lookin through the club I'm really searchin for who's sane
The music got everyone crazy and who to blame
Be prepared think there'll be some ugliness up in here
End up in intensive care with the vegetables there, you know?

It's the black hand bustin' the tech
Gettin' it wet without bustin' a sweat
Swingin' for the upper deck
It's the black man cuttin' a check
The nigga's the boss
The niggers want to test if they addicted to laws
I spit on the floor
The right hook will get at your jaw
Make the track my baby mama when I'm hittin' it raw
I rap through:
Wars and tours and whores on the floors I did it for force
So I spit at all the shit that I saw
I party with supermodels who wanna take of they clothes
The ones who smokin' cocaine so they don't fuck up they nose
I walked the slums of Soweto and the streets of Havana
Takin' pictures with kids who never seen a camera
From the land of the Alabama since the night in the Cali
Bumpin' gangster music like a freedoms song in the rally
Out the back of yo' Dinnali give you the skinny like Ally McBeal
It's the black steel, Brooklyn know the deal, what?!
Embed
Yeah, this that new Kweli
I'mma give it to you before the bootleggers get hold of
It
You know what I'm sayin'?
I figure I put it out first, make some money wit' it
Why not, right?
Okay, 1-2

Yo I'm Brooklyn like the '90s
Brownsville and Bushel keep it grimey
When I'm from flatbush that's where you'll find me
In Brooklyn, Tek wit' Justin and Sadat
And Free and Sid from ???
Always catch me wit' Juju and Rubiks, we was truant kids
Dollar band nooseses
Jump bell, run, and never look back
Mr. Man kept the hammer in his bookbag
Rubiks introduced me to Black and Forte
DJ Enuff on Avenue K I go back a long way
Wit' Super Nat in Washington Square freestylin' everyday
Peformin' at Lyricists' Lounge who ate off Jean Grae
Fuckin' wit' Mood is how I met Hi-Tek
Black Star came in effect when Elijah gave my tape to Mos Def
Reflection Eternal was next on deck
My crew the best and we proved it
We knew our music was the Vanguard of a movement
Every Rawkus release was bangin', they on the come up
They was like fuck the radio 'til Pharoahe said "Get the fuck up"
Flex listened, jabbin' at Bryant
The next position was right about now we need the
Radio hit written
While I hit the road
On tour to support the records since the day it was sold
Corey had me followin' the example of De La Soul
Common and The Roots to me these the sickest niggas
Get my figures wit' the Okayplayers and the Spitkickers
Rawkus got a deal with MCA, this the gray area
The letters stand for Music Cemetery of America
They tried to fool you by switchin' the name to Geffen
Now they Interscope's bitch and every artist who had a chance left 'em
Ain't no big surprise, wasn't no love there
Jimmy Iovine never signed me, I just kinda ended up there
But fuck that, literally it was my way or the highway
Hit the road with the Beastie Boys and toured Europe with Kanye
Gotta thank 'em for the love on the album
I knew out on "Electric Circus"
He'd get it by any means necessary like Malcolm
I dropped a single, shot a video, took control of my situation
Got a label poppin', it's a celebration (bitches)
Yo boy Free I had to get out

Astonish the flow critics, rhyme wit the most lyrics
I paint pictures, jot it and dot it but won't print it
My ? is photogenic, I am the most vivid
Man, I got a brain the size of the most biggest
Wide as them cold rivers, wise as them old niggas
Tired of this, though, half of you rhyme it but don't live it
Watch it and go spit it, stop it, I know Physics

Plus, the shit you kick so wack niggas ready to fight you
Fuck rap, you better off wit spoken word kickin' Haiku
Or rhymes got teeth that'll bite you, make it clearer than white booze
You ain't special, there's a million rappers like you
Far from clumsy, but I drop lines and spill bars
Smoke more trees and be around more Black chicks than Bill Maher

The Beast is out when the police is out
They be pullin' out and really showin' you what peace/piece about
Upholdin' the law that's designed to keep my people down
Bourgeois niggas walkin' around like everything is equal now
I'm peepin' how from the beat cop to the Interstate trooper
To the Feds who put a price on Assata - head to Cuba, B
Protectin' the property value over the people life
To take action against a foul government is the people right
But not too many ready to fight
It's like you'd rather be at home watchin' a flick or a fight
Or maybe Nick-At-Nite
It's sick how I'm addicted to mics, become a flickerin' light
After I spark I'm always ready to write
Where I'm from, they be watchin' us, but we be watchin' them
And bust shots 'til the coppers bring the choppers in
The squad cars try to box me in
But I got knowledge of self and it's stronger than any cage you can lock me in

There's more to us than that
We the shit consider the facts, after you analyze that
You know you best to fall back

I'm dealing with, nothing but facts, when I spit it, though
You niggas superstitious don't step on the cracks or split the pole
Candle light, flickers so bright, my silhouette can kick a sicker flow
And spill it like a liquor store, I spit the shit to make a cripple get up and dance
I spit the shit to make the average MC piss in his pants
I spit the shit to make a motherfucker call it a night
I spit the shit to see fuck wit C. Delores Tucker sex like
I take a sip from my creative well, in this game for a minute
I play this well to win it, you go to Africa, like Dave Chappelle, you finished
Cause your prehistoric raps is boring, the number of whack rappers soaring
Like the percentages of teenagers who have abortions
These niggas meek, their lyrics weak, and their beats is corporate
They try snitching on records their mouths is leaking faucets
Dripping them over system than, Chinese water torture
Ripping a series of events, more unfortunate than Lemony Snicket

I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, but I don't fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham, Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through, my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive, shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters, rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad

You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that

(Ladies I know I get hot) Like lava flow
Strictly the A game, rock it fast, rock it slow
(Hop to the beat and then stop) Yeah, drop it low
Baby I got the flow to work your abdominal
(Ladies I know I get hot) Like lava flow
Strictly the A game, drop it fast

That's how we do it all the way live..
I put it down so hard that I developed a rep (c'mon)
From the punchlines to cave in your delicate chest
The fella can test, let's see how jealousy get
I smell the fear in the air and I could tell he was pet'
Kweli - look in my eyes and you could tell I'm a threat
I wet my throat and get bent like a pelican's neck
I make a gentleman's bet with my ghetto connect
And got a .9 in my mind you can't metal detect
I pull it out, put it to your head and shoot from the hip
I fired 13 shots and left 2 in the clip (yeah)
I spit the truth, that's it, I'm not confused one bit (c'mon)
I'm so New York City streets that I'm abusin your whip
Cruisin the strip, sunny day sky blue like a Crip (c'mon)
For the rush hour Enuff threw this in the mix
Quarter to six, Amadeus is producin the hits (oh, oh, oh)
To get a screw loose in your chick, son she losin her shit (whoa)

Check me out, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get your ass up on the dance floor
No we don't stop, when we in the dance off
Baby girl whatchu wanna get into?

I know he ain't talking, this is grown-man business
Be your own man, stand on your own feet
I thought we was homies
But you comin' at me like you don't know me
You think you do, but you're probably wrong
I'm surrounded by more babies than Ashanti songs, oh baby
I know you don't get it
Try to walk in my shoes, I know you won't fit it
Just cause I know you and your flow, too
There's more to it, you won't get it, I don't owe you
You want Hi-Tek to do a record for you
So niggas is checking for you
Cut the bull, cause niggas get respected for you
Get your own respect dude, that ain't mean and evil
Ain't no crutches in my crew
My crew a crew of equals (yup)
Shit was cool when we was teenagers, we grown men
You my people, but I don't need you moanin' and groanin'
I can't feed you, I already got kids
How a nigga trying to regulate some shit that’s not his?
I ain't trying to sign, I'm just an artist, nigga
I'm just trying to rhyme and go the hardest, nigga

Radio suckers never play me cause I don't let them

Dodge the paparazzi, I don't wanna see no lady die
Sports entertainment, academics, business, or politics
The fine hoes swallow dicks for dollars quick
Young broads all up in gangs like the Young Lords
Jump forward, statutory rape, now you done for
What, you thought that shorty 'bout to act a her age
Right now, somebody's daughter is backstage
It's a master-slave relationship, and guess who Toby
It's the white girl in Colorado, and guess who Kobe
Tried to tell you not to fuck with these debutantes
That's more Kobe beef than Japanese restaurants
Don't need diseases or cases, trying to catch nothing
And when they throwing pussy, best believe you catching something

Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto

Black magic in the hood, it's tragic but understood
Crack addicts, crack windows, crack wood
Even what's bad becomes good, status becomes stood
Upon the pedestal welcome to the ghetto show
Federal buildings, pissy hallways filled with children pushing children
Fiends lips peeling, shit seems real and
What's real is the estate of mind that we're in
The situation feels great
My man peels weight, so he can fill plates
You might get love but you still feel hate
With gang shakes and chain clinks, we communicate
Chicago to Brooklyn nigga real ones do relate

Cause it's the music, the blues, it's the jazz, it's acoustics
Soul, Rock and Roll, the hip-hop that we producin', yea
It's the gear, it's the flare, it's the stare
Nowadays they'll shoot you where they used to shoot the fair
Remember lost soldiers, pour a beer, shoot the air
We got our own elected officials, no matter who the mayor
I know you know what I'm talking about
From New York to the South, take off your shoes when you walk in the house

Yo, I grew up where they're playin' skelly in the parking lot
And sell paintings of Aaliyah, B.I.G. and Pac up in the barbershop
Buildings too big so you don't really see the stars a lot
But rappin', drinkin', and goin' to prison you see them bars a lot
I feel the spirit in the dark and hear it in my heart
And always keep my ears to the block till I dearly depart
Hip-hop is really the art
We have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves
It ain't harder to tell when somebody stick you up and put the hammer to you
They want them dead presidents like stic.man and Mutulu
With a gun to your jaw, these kids don't run anymore
Kicks is a hundred or more
A man in front of the store, beggin' for money and mercy
I told him say a prayer under his breath, he cursed me
Niggas is thirsty I heard it's a drought
Up early, servin' from their grandmother's house
Sometimes the ghetto feels desolate, the eyes of the hood yo is desperate
Affected by the deficit, times and lessons get hard
Either get by or get God, but you try to get by
It's like the block keep blockin'
You try to make moves, its like the car keep stoppin'
These shorties in the court, need Cochran yea
I tell them while the weed seeds poppin', in the game you need options
No time for feet watchin', me and Kwe keep rockin' for the ghetto

Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look it's never what you see

I've been down before up is just a reach

I say the shit these people ain't got the heart to say
Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
When bullets start to spray the revolution start today

You say you never scared?
There's kids in other countries making jerseys, jeans, and sneakers they could never wear
Parents never there, they busy building homes they can't afford to buy
Cars they can't afford to drive, working jobs that don't support their life
You busy screaming Gangsta Gangsta, all that talk is trife
You already know lost the fight if you don't know the cost of life
These kids is forced to fight a war they can't outrun
Ain't got no shoes but got a gun, now where the fuck he pulled that out from?
People ask me how we wearing diamonds
When there's little kids in Sierra Leone losing arms for cryin' while they minin'
Probably an orphan whose momma died of AIDS
He built the coffin working often but he never paid
Forever slaving in the world that's forever cold
Becoming the man of the house at 11 years old
This reality rap, I get inside the mentality that
Terrorize you like a cowardly act

I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin'
Middle Passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denied history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their husbands be beaten viciously
Battlin' the wilderness of North America
Ran by the river, only stoppin' to pray, chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who fuckin' kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom for their protection deserve neither
Not a name, not tradition, religion, you learn Jesus
Turn the other cheek, inherit the Earth, just stay meek
Fuck the way you speak, try to run, we chop off your feet
Fast forward to 2004 we selling raw
Yo this ain't what I'm settling for, I want more, yo

Get searched on the plane, Arabic first name
Disturbed by the fame just like Kurt Cobain
Breath of life, kiss of death, my lips pursed the same
You flirt 'til she came
Nothin' hurt like the pain and torture
Daughters of the dust lookin' for a vein
Something to take in vain like the Lord's name

Although we speak in different languages
We all pretty familiar with what anger is
Young and dangerous, trigger stranglers
Get up on some gangsta shit
Guns to bang ya wit'
And we put it on records to entertain ya wit'
Our growing pains get way deeper than Mike Seaver's
Our uniforms is white sneakers and white T-shirts
On top of wife beaters
We like to light reefers
The 'hood need us, but rappers just ain't the right leaders
I put a lot into it
This is my product and I gotta move it
Stop the industry, but you can't stop the music

An upside down kingdom where life is just not fair (Upside down kingdom)
So many sufferin' 'cause deep inside they're scared (So scared)
Fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny
Where would they be if you and I don't care?

The things I'm seein' on the news is insane
A stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front the train
A mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself
Two years old, eatin' ketchup and mustard, cryin for help
Tryin' to bring your struggle to life
The label want a song about a bubbly life

When people suffer tonight

Got spit like a french kiss chicks lock lips
Coming from the deep black like the Loch Ness
Now bring apocalypse like the heart of darkness

Pop music is the black market

Terrorists send bombs at the concert

Wow, and go fast like the bullet that ran through the dark
The hollow tip ripped a man apart, blaow
Yo these soldiers die in petroleum wars
Think they fighting for the holliest cause

Ain't no rule to a surpestition stop me with going through with my mission

I put it out in the world, so people show me (Love)
Yeah, I always get it back
This ain't no pimp game here, that's a different track (Yeah)
We talkin' this and that, we need to get with this
I keep it realer than most, this is our business

What we gotta do to make them see we got a good thing going on?
Want to tell the world if they don't know that what we have is real
Want to shout it from the mountains, baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

That's the dream, but I never sleep
Across a crowded room, our eyes forever meet
Filled up with doubt and gloom, 'cause we could never be
That's why I got to go, you my impossible love
You the horizon I can see but never ride off into
I write my lyrics to you, you the perfect instrumental
I sound better than the cat who rappin' to you now
That's between me and you, what happened to us now? (Love, love, love...)
Got you hopin' for the glorious waitin' for that victorious feelin' wanted by all of us
Kneelin' and prayin' that the lord in us will help us love ourselves
So much that the confidence attracted someone else

What we gotta do to make them see we got a good thing going on?
Want to tell the world if they don't know that what we have is real
Want to shout it from the mountains, baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me

Yo, rockin' Los Angeles, House of Blues on Sunset
Performin' like a orgasm, my girl ain't even cum yet
Seen her by the side of the stage givin' me energy
Potentially wife material connectin' mentally
I felt like heaven sent for me, you're meant for me
The doubters and the haters had to acknowledge eventually
You was a non-believer too if memory serves
And now hardly give shit, tryin' to play your boy for the herb
The harder that I run to you, the farther you become
It's like my heart was part of some movie that hadn't yet begun
This woman moves me and I'm a mountain of a man
You pull me in like the waves do the grain of sand (Love, love, love...)
Yeah, I love the way you bring it to me
I wrote a song for you, I'd love to hear you to sing it for me
And let the melody carry me through the jealousy
And we can cruise like Tom and Penelope
What we gotta do to make them see we got a good thing going on?
Want to tell the world if they don't know that what we have is real
Want to shout it from the mountains, baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me

Yo son, what the deal son? What's really hood son? (what's really hood?)
Word is born, shit is real, shit is real
Yo son, this block is def
Nigga need to go over here and pop off real quick
I gotta get that gwop by all means, you know what I'm sayin son

Growing up in Brooklyn, shit I thought that everybody talked this way
Raised on Rakim and Run-D.M.C., so I thought that everybody walked this way
"We fresh, we chill, we def, we ill," it's just some things that was taught to say
And every Saturday morning, I watched cartoons with a bowl of Frosted Flakes
Then.. the puberty came, started hitting them cuties with game and the truancy came (uh!)
Started cutting in not just class, I was comin all fast, I was new to the game (uh!)
Used to playin on T.V., courtesy of video music box
Plus! Knew a lot of hustlas, goin O.T., comin back with the new hip-hop
Like! E-40 holding down the yay (that yay), N.W.A. in L.A
OutKast from the A-Town, way down in Houston they play the UGK
I walk and talk kinda fast and thought of as a New York kinda rhymer (word is born)
But must New Yorkers got family in South and North Carolina (come on!)
L.A. is little Alabama, they walk and they talk with a country grammar
New York think everybody else sound country, so they get started, started callin 'em 'Bamas
Down south where we buy them hammers, down south where we sell them drugs
Down south where life is cheap, where they quick to fill you with them slugs

Word up to my man Bun B what?
It's nothin, I'm from New York but I got country cousins
It's nothin, we stay connected by the slang we bustin
The thing we bustin, the game we hustlin, the things we cuttin
The flame we cuppin, the lames we snuffin, your name is nothin!

Growing up in P.A., I knew nobody out there talked like us
Nothin but that county slang, "What up dog? What up cuzz?"
Late night you see us guzzling 40's, menthols, wine, and weed
Sitting on the back porch, getting zooted, feeling fine indeed
Listening to Eric B. and Rakim or EPMD
Cool C and Steady B, plus that Public Enemy
Not to mention N.W.A., DJ Quik, and MC Eiht
Down south we listen to it all, we didn't discriminate
Then along came Geto Boys, Raheem, and the Royal Flush
Rap-A-Lot Records based out in Houston, represents for us
O.G. Style, The Convicts, Def IV and Too Much Trouble
Odd Squad and Ganksta NIP put it down for H-Town on the double
So I said, "It's time to hustle," got down with my brother C
Put together UGK and shit the rest is history
We make hits by the dozen, put it down when they said we wasn't
Trust me it's nothin, just another day in the life of your country cousins

In Brooklyn, New York I'm down with Lord Jamar
Back in P.A.T., man we be sippin the barre
I'm down with J. from Houston and I think it should be
But when I'm out in L.A. I fuck with Ice-T
Short Dog is my O.G., we been down forever
Taught me the game, lane to lane, and keep my pimpin' together
Niggas don't understand by far back in the day
It was Mase and then my brother put me up on Black Star
Starving blacks often lose our way
Cause we isolate ourselves and give our ghetto pass away
My niggas pass away in an unreal way
They mommas depleted, I'm just tryna make sure that their kids straight
I'm on the chitlin' tour with my mic in my hand
Shittin' on these jealous niggas in the new world clan
I wouldn't trade it for nothin, only a crazy man would
I represent for the whole South, but mainly just for my hood
The pimpin's good...

I got cousins (I got cousins), country cousins (country cousins)
Like blood that's thicker than water (it's nothin), down dirty 'cross the border
I got cousins (I got cousins), country cousins (country cousins)
Like blood that's thicker than water (it's nothin), down dirty 'cross the border
They're my country cousins!Embed
The temperature got tempers flaring
People sweat when the weather hot
They argue and they fret a lot
Then set up the plot to whet up the block
Whether or not the blood is red up in the gutter
Music is my bread and butter
I got a show in Brooklyn cause the ghetto love us
Pulled up in Mtulu's truck
I'm suited up I'm cool as fuck
Security tripping on my baseball hat
Promoter knew what's up
Plus Chaps had on some denim shorts and white tee shirt and
I told the bouncer they being disrespectful cause like you we working
I ain't a custy or a patron and
Trust me no one would be paying to come in this crusty ass club if I ain't playing
He's like "I'll put you the fuck out"
And when you put your words like that its like third strike black you struck out
His man tried to rush me from behind Chaps stuck out a size nine
Seen him trip face first into the line
Cats is cowards with no spine and they power tripping too
The next level is the violence
So what y'all niggas wanna do

Work it out
We should try to work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read a book, pray to God
Look inside to work it out
We should try to work it out
Yo what y'all ladies wanna do
Work it out
To get fly she work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read a book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
Show the love
Lose the hate
Work it out
Work it out

People placed in situations
They can't take and what they facing
Is the trials and tribulations to make them say the lords forsaken them
Their loved ones intervening but they always end up blaming them
For problems they don't realize what they part is in creating them
Like men who so insecure think they women cheating on them
And women who think the proof that they man love them is they beating on them
Keep sleeping on them soon they partner creeping on them
Committing crimes of passion they in caskets mother weeping on them
With her head in her hands there's only one thing that the dead understand
That it's better to be alive
Now what you gonna do stick your head in the sand
You probably the type to fall for anything and take that instead of a stand
Now that's a mouse instead of a man
I cherish my role as the head of my fam
And on the road I meet incredible fans
I rock with singers an a DJ instead of a band
We at a theatre near you
So what y'all niggas wanna do


Stay civilized when they try to kill my high
I try to think through problems
Bring honesty to rap like Cam'ron brought the pink to Harlem
You could be on the brink to stardom and suddenly you sink to bottom
Tell the truth about the war and suddenly you linked Saddam
Hate the topic but the closet people get to patriotic
Is red bull white vodka mixed with the straight hypnotic
Paper prophets sell the revolution so they make a profit
Trust they got it fucked up with your taxes started making rockets
Take it off the top like politicians speaking proper diction
Stuffing dollars in they britches like they do a lotta stripping
Got the top position bitching about the quality of life
All that bullshit get exposed as soon as Kweli sees the mic
They cutting down the tree of life
The sun rays is running out
The babies ain't eating right
The guns stay coming out
See how they play the streets an night slap the taste out your mouth
To show you what they work about
So what y'all niggas wanna do

Now the question has been raised, what the fuck happened to you?

Parched aren't we?
Honestly shorty, let me check make sure I ain't got no fleas up on me
From minglin' with them ol' pussy ass niggas and dog ass bitches
Old veterans get bit by the youngins

Seen your rapper on stage you and your little crew
We so sick of these Thelonius dudes
Annoyance grew and the audience boo
We had enough of your corny excuse
Living in the world of my own adventure
Life a gunfight, a knife is your only weapon
You don’t really know what the fuck you stepped in
Better chill right now, life such a blessing
Save the feedback, where the weed at?
Imagine me at an intervention
You the one who need an intervention
To stop you from interruptin’ sessions
Wow that’s such a nasty habit
Wow this marijuana marriage got my wifey jealous
I get selfish when I’m making fuckin’ classics
Amsterdam or California, Washington, Oregon or Colorado
When we blaze in the club the Jamaican bud
Got me feelin’ so special, no bravado

Hey ya I emerge from the south with the mind to get paid
Cup of some drank keep it stuck in my ways
Livin’ life tryna catch me a wave
In the same state they used to wholesale slaves
Pimp tight nigga hold up
Presidential when I roll up, like a playa do
She in love put nothing above purest the drug in a day or two
That’s a playa move, in this game of life can’t cruisade or lose
You gotta be willin’ to be the villain to give it  gator shoes
I heard it from an old school kid, say I had an old school soul
Told me I was bound to be great, never fall for the fake
And never ever chase no ho, gotta make that dough
Crack my seal, pop my trunk and work my wheel
Cause every now and then, reflect on times
That I ain’t have dimes to fuck or dough to spend
So I gotta keep my mind right, forever run from the limelight
I don’t need no fame, my aura shine so bright
I’m a star in my own right, forever loyal to the game


I love this nostalgic shit
This whore right here
Is literally like the perfect blow job

Good morning niggas
Good morning, good afternoon, goodnight
Whatever time zone you are listening along to this hot mellow shit
Make sure you get your ass up and go do some shit
Let this music get in your ass and make you move fast
And don’t be late to class with your late ass
This is a hot compilation called The Cathedral
By my main man, my ace, my mellow fellow, Talib Kweli Greene
Ha ha ha, speak on it God
And if you didn’t hear me the first time I said it
Muthafuckin’ speak on it God

Peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like anoth- peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like anoth- peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like anoth- peace to the Gods, peace Allah
It’s like another day
Like yesterday, we take it back to another day

The attribute Kweli, ain’t no acronym involved
It’s a blessing to be alive, God is love
So I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
That we despise because they killas of the vibe
These capitalistic rappers is plastic, obey they masters
Your hustle kill your people then your hustlin’ is backwards
You the maker not the owner of your dream and
Man it hurts the devil couldn’t have planned it better
You couldn’t have planned it worse
Call my son, son, cause he shine when he smile the sun
Distance from the Earth is like 93 millions miles
Beat up the track like a pugilist
I come correct I never sell out on the foolishness, who is tis?
Put the money in my hand, never the grown ass man in the club doin’ the new dance
I keep it grounded, stay true to my sound
They throwin’ rocks but them niggas never comin’ for the crown
Slain of those who fight for what is right
You not owed and you never promised nothin’ in this life
Married to the block but you gotta renew your vows
I see the devil smile as you walkin’ down the aisle
For the dollas now we facin’ extermination
But I have knowledge of my self-determination
Criminalisation of an entire generation
Mass incarceration’s a muthafuckin’ bad situation
The knowledge and the wisdom is your power
I see God in myself
I won’t diss the next rapper you just hafta pay your dues
Fuck a rapper, I compete with James Baldwin and a Lagston Hughes
So my baby’s born to think this is the way of us
They take the babies from the fathers so it ain’t no trust
They say they want the new self-destruction
But ask ‘em what they payin’ and they sayin nothin’
They put they people before us (murderer)
They say this land ain’t ours (murderer)
But when you focus on compassion that’ll lead to your understandin’
(Facts only, facts only)
Know your freedoms (murderer)
Try to live righteous (murderer)
The nigga Kweli been droppin’ knowledge since Washington Square park cyphers

I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low get low but you never been as low as me

I always speak for the struggle my people still hurting
I'm a name brand I'm a product but still a real person
I'm still flirting with death although I'm still certain
About my commitments in life although I'm still searching
I bet I find a way if not I bet I make a path
One thats seldom traveled by the masses
I never stuck in all the traffic I cut through all the plastic
Enemies of the enlightened like the government is fascist
I talk it how I live it yet I'm still considered a walking contradiction
Cause I'm breaking out of your artistic prison listen
I got my own demons what I'm supposed to do with yours
Times like this I gotta remind myself what I do It for
People I knew before celebrity swear they see the change in me
I tell em change is god you gotta let it be

Thats why we gotta clash with the Titans like Pegasus
No Oedipus but it's like the beat is my therapist
When I let it in it get up in the cracks and the crevices
Of my memories what kind of treasure are you buried with
You fight when you die are you a soldier or a terrorist
Remember this there's no one else to blame when you're solo
Establish your fan base local before you take it global
Don't be scared spend your own dough
You gotta speak up be vocal sometimes you feel so low
Ain't nowhere to go but up go with us
We just getting started why you slowing up
But know enough to know by a collective we
Even if my name is on the record sleeve I ain't into brevity

Angels cry every time someone lie
They fall to the Earth and they lose their wings

Come a forth mile, come up with a smile

They’re ain’t no respecting lady
There ain’t no hesitating
So where our neck is breaking and the respect is taken?
I pause cause nothing is given
We get lost in the system
Ah, ah, ... but what’s the cause you’re living?
Boys like me... to the prison
Laws are written be a pause for...

Martin Luther King Junior had a dream
That was ... streets and hospitals
Where the bodies go before they’re berried
Or already half way to the cemetery
This ..who holds the story
..the ice and the cream like...
And the murder story but the ghetto is clean
...working on a seven day lean
..just grabbing a heavenly scene ...
The point I’m making is know your colors
Before your blood run red in the ghetto
I got a flow to make you so shut up
Can you borrow that? No my brother!
Get your own, get in the zone
And tell everybody that it’s your song...
..turn your felonies into melodies
Recipes to my nigga..

We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk and the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bones
To get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while your egos spread rumors
We survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people gotta live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth, they hot like the jail cell in the south
Before my nigga Cor' bailed me out
To get by, just to get by

It's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees and we stay drunk
Yo, our activism attackin' the system, the Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen, they victims lackin' the vision
Shit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to
I let 'em know we missin' you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin' you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The TV got us reachin' for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars
The ones that be readin' for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin' to rely on, we get high on all types of drug
When all you really need is love
To get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon, imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney, from now until the last Beatle drop, what?
This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows and my soul
And my goal's just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
And I've been thinkin', I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

Yo-yo-yo, yo, yo
Some people cry and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high, we deceive and we lie
And we keepin' it fly, y-y-y-yo, yo
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find, strong or feeble in mind
I stay readin' the signs, y-y-y-yo, yo, yo
Some people cry and some people try

'Bout to slap box with the beat
The shit I spit, it's a snapshot of the street
You can see the crack spot in the backdrop
The heat in the stash spot of the black drop
You wonder why there's more crime
Free food, or a check the only time niggas on line
Getting information from the nigga-net
The trickle-down theory guess it ain't reached niggas yet
I make a bigger bet
Kweli 'bout to be a bigger threat
'Cuz there's hardly any real niggas left
What the fuck these niggas talking 'bout
Living the movie but the audience is walking out
I fight the temptation to rip the heart from your chest
'Til there's only five hard beats left
It's like a dead man walking
I turn on the radio and I hear dead men talking

Add that number up with every nigga you don't
Final number, sum total of the niggas that won't
Break me down, shake me up or fade my style
What time it is?, cool you can hate me now
And ten minutes from then, you gon' love me again
Bucktown republic again
Writing on the wall trouble again
Intensify struggle and such
Killers, Sade love is deluxe
Sound garnered, for the wild hearted
Downtrodden, up-starters
Young violent, uprising
Cocaine, and gunpowder
Up north, or bus crowded
Daily rides to thug mountain
Cold caves and peaks are high
Danger present but unclear, and know how to hide
If you wonder why you got so much on your mind
'Cuz your living in a troubling time, this is a puzzling time
Fall back without recovering time, and time's up
Brooklyn, put your dimes up


I put feeling inside of my rap
Hold it down for my side of the map
No matter what north, south east or west side that I'm at
Bend the needle on the monitors back

Got a problem with that?
The holler back if the stars is black
We the New Era, you just a Starter cap
Find out what happens when the artist attack
Be sharp as a tack, fall back you smarter than that

Or perhaps you just ain't as smart as you think
Figure 8'n on the thin ice part of the rink
You're a vessel that's promised to sink
Terra firma ain't as hard as you think
Stare down, and you starting to blink

Like 182 this for fellas and the ladies who
Don't need to be spoon fed like baby food
I take a bite out the track like a Sabre-tooth
And spit out the truth
'Til the cops come and spray the booth

It's all right with you, it's all right with me
Do the damn thing, what you wanna be (Supreme, Supreme)
That's right, that's right that's right that's right
That's right, that's right that's right that's right (Supreme, Supreme)Embed

Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Turbo-charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo mufuckin' self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
'Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing

Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond

I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement

Impede on your pockets then pee on ya

Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in–
–to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck has been
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
I'm focused
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
