10 ContributorsSwagger to the Max Lyrics
True religions sagging, I'm bagging, can't pull them up
Big boy trucks, I'm rolling and pulling up
Swisher Sweets blowing, we break it and rolling up
Niggas steady hating, they faking and folding up
Walk around town level peaking the self esteem
Ain't about the flows my nigga, it's about the cream
This is real talk, y'all niggas is day dreams
You can do a show a day, you can't afford these jeans
Nikes you ain't seen, you cop yours from the liquor store
Red munks(?), 50 bucks, show you what a nigga know
Cop it on sight, while you shopping for deals
Leaving Somerset while you go to Forman Mills
Show up at the party, get the hoes hazed out
Never rock Carti's 'cuz that shit played out
(?) in the system, give me one listen
Hit the booth and bless it like a prostitute and Christian

Ahead of my time
I stay on my grind
I'm taking your shine
This city is mine
You know where I'm at
Don't know how to act
I'm taking it back
So nigga relax
My swagger to the max
I stay on my grind
I'm taking your shine
This city is mine
You know where I'm at
Don't know how to act
I'm taking it back
So nigga relax
My swagger to the max
You might also like
I said there's lead in the toys so your kids can't play
Girls kissing on the tube tryna turn your daughter gay
Free condoms in the class but you paying for your books
The system wants your ass, minorities overlooked
You copping on the block, want you to cop for a judge
Hit you with high numbers, say they tryna show you love
That's how they do us niggas, want us trapped behind bars
So we trapped in our home, rolling weed out of jars
Feeling like Merv pop when he picked that heater up
'Bout to kill the game like Marvin picking needles up
(??????) got me riding all night, blowing purple in the Cutty got me riding all night
Henny got me feeling right, she know she with the troop
She ain't gotta lie, when she shake she feeling loose
(?) in the system, give me one listen
Hit the booth and bless it like a prostitute and Christian

Ahead of my time
I stay on my grind
I'm taking your shine
This city is mine
You know where I'm at
Don't know how to act
I'm taking it back
So nigga relax
My swagger to the max
I stay on my grind
I'm taking your shine
This city is mine
You know where I'm at
Don't know how to act
I'm taking it back
So nigga relax
My swagger to the maxEmbed
