7 ContributorsDo What You Like Lyrics
QB, ya shit, shit is crazy, yo
Can't fuck with you, fo' real
They can't fuck with you
They can't fuck with you
What's wrong with y'all bitches, man?
What's wrong with y'all niggas, man?
C'mon, the fuck is wrong with y'all niggas?
Where you at, nigga? C'mon, nigga
Where you at? Where you at, nigga? C'mon

Yo, check 'em out, yo you you
When it's murder on my mind, I do it all the time
Got tombstone flow, with a casket rhyme
Your gats is plastic, I got platinum nines
With gold shells Banger Vegas tap ya spine
I'm the type to spaz out and take back what's mine
Rep for my hood niggas slingin' crack and dimes
Half is mine, so you know it's half my time
In the pen or the box, with my man on the ox
We gon do it like we did it on the block
Let's roll, like with 60's 30's
40 niggas with me
Rep ya hood, rep ya block, rep ya city
This is me talkin', without the Remy in me
I kick it from the heart, that's why niggas feel me
Show y'all the true meanin' why Banger act willie
'Cause I start to spaz and smack a bitch silly
They call Leo Ganza with the twin nine millis
Yea niggas
You might also like
Do what you like (we don't give a fuck)
Go head and fight (all my bitches grab a nigga)
And fuck tonight (it's ya motherfuckin' world)
Do what you like, do what you like
Do what you like (you got a motherfuckin' gun)
Bust of the nine (all my niggas grab a bitch)
And fuck tonight (it's ya motherfuckin' world)
Do what you like, do what you like

Ayo yo ayo, this is for them niggas frontin', don't really want it
My 32 bullets got all ya names on it
Hit 'em in the brain, niggas slain, layin' dormant
Iced out grenade, with the big chains on it
New Years blimp Wit B.I.G. name on it
Iceburg sweaters wit Kim name on it
Cease-A-Le Tee wit big blood stain on it
Every time I sign a check, I sign a thug name on it
Niggas got rhymes but they flow's so borin'
No stage shows, so forget about tourin'
Mad at my team 'cause my niggas stay scorin'
All you gotta do is make a false move and it's warnin'
My guns bust
Niggas get wet when it's pourin'
Rain down long like Kim gettin' dressed in the mornin'
Five-star general, spit a Uzi at ya coffin
Run up in ya crib without a search warrant
Do what you like (we don't give a fuck)
Go head and fight (all my bitches grab a nigga)
And fuck tonight (it's ya motherfuckin' world)
Do what you like, do what you like
Do what you like (you got a motherfuckin' gun)
Bust of the nine (all my niggas grab a bitch)
And fuck tonight (it's ya motherfuckin' world)
Do what you like, do what you like

Once again it's on
The motherfuckin' psychos, M.A.F.I.A
Bitches feel us, we the realest
My Bed Stuy niggas is who I ride for
Send that ass slow like I ride a six four
I'm what ya kids admire
Don't wanna see retire
Got bitches in the pen and in the church choir
Got a new attitude for the Y2K
Same shit nigga try me I'ma blow em away

Ayo move out the way Bris, I'm about to hook off
Sick of motherfuckers tryna play us like we soft
You have any idea how many words I shook off
I'm not havin' uh no I'm not havin' it
You heard what I said, don't make me raise my voice
And I know y'all don't want me to call me boys
M.A.F.I.A. we break rules in the club
My whole crews in the club
And girl, don't you hate when bitches be with the friends
Dancin' all wild
Bumpin you again and again
Yea I know That some real punk shit
Fuck that I ain't tryna hear that drunk shit
Bitches like that get stomped out
You know the rules, beat a bitch till she conk out
Lady what we fear nigga you like
Give 'em a pussy invite
It's aight, maybe get ya pussy sucked tonight
Do what you like (we don't give a fuck)
Go head and fight (all my bitches grab a nigga)
And fuck tonight (it's ya motherfuckin' world)
Do what you like, do what you like
Do what you like (you got a motherfuckin' gun)
Bust of the nine (all my niggas grab a bitch)
And fuck tonight (it's ya motherfuckin' world)
Do what you like, do what you like

Y'all need to cut it out 'fore ya get stomped out
Yeah, muthafuckas
All my niggas get high and fuck tonight
It's our motherfuckin' world
Y'all need to cut it out 'fore ya get stomped out
