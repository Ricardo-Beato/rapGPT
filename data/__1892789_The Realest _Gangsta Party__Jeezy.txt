13 ContributorsThe Realest (Gangsta Party) Lyrics
We the realest
Can't you tell the difference
All my niggas icy we some cold ass niggas
Nigga we the realest
Cocaine with me, we really with the business
All ya niggas know the business
Nigga she the realest
She don't call it stripping
She just say she getting money with her bitches
Nigga she the realest
She is independent, she would only bust it open for a real nigga
And niggas know we the realest

Y'all niggas know wassup
(Wassup (x4))
I'm YG, call me Richie's rich's
I ain't spend shit, I'ma be rich as fuck
Y'all bitches know wassup
(Wassup (x4))
Got 7 inches in my pants, come home with me girl I'ma go ham
Lemme show ya how I'm the realest
I put on my niggas
And I'm good in every city
Yeah pull up with the semi
I'm the realest, I don't want shit nigga
Fuck you and your handout
I'd rather get it on my own
So If I ever lose it I know how to make them bands bounce back
I'm the realest, pull off in that Porsche, with no license plate
Strap all on my lap
If I get pulled over, my nigga take the case, he the realest
Damn that nigga need a house on the hills where I feel like that
She coming call me over to fuck
I fuck, I nut, I leave, she think
You might also like
We the realest
Can't you tell the difference
All my niggas icy we some cold ass niggas
Nigga we the realest
Cocaine with me, we really with the business
All ya niggas know the business
Nigga she the realest
She don't call it stripping
She just say she getting money with her bitches
Nigga she the realest
She is independent, she would only bust it open for a real nigga
And niggas know we the realest

Rock so loud, I'm bout to go deaf
White and black stone, bout to go ref
Its cold out here, I got 4 heats
Hawk game now I got floor seats
I'm in that double r with the AK
Straight sink a nigga shit like Mayday
Pull up in the shit with reverse doors
And you know I can't forget bout them mink floors
Stay fuck round me if you the police
Pink slips shawty baby no lease
I'm the type of nigga flip a parakeet
Go count that paper like it therapy
You the type of nigga on some bullshit
Money always short nigga, bushwick
You can ask the nigga from my whole block
Like the best buy baby kept in the stock
You on your real nigga shit, pull a kick door
Every nigga know me, know I'm schitzo
I'm the type of mothafucka wake up early in the morning
Cook a couple chickens up, no Crisco
Show up 4 or 5 deep like them backstreet niggas
4, 5 choppas on the backseat nigga
Nigga talking like they gangsta they really athlete nigga
Fuck around turn your set to a track meet nigga
We the realest
Can't you tell the difference
All my niggas icy we some cold ass niggas
Nigga we the realest
Cocaine with me, we really with the business
All ya niggas know the business
Nigga she the realest
She don't call it stripping
She just say she getting money with her bitches
Nigga she the realest
She is independent, she would only bust it open for a real nigga
And niggas know we the realestEmbed
