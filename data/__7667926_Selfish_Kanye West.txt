I gotta put me first
I gotta put me first
I gotta put me first, Lucious
I understand that, and I promise you—
Selfish, I just want you all to my own
These— these b— won't leave me alone
Damaged by the fact I’m alone

I put me first
I put me first, Lucien
What was it worth?
What was it worth in the end?
It was just a purse
It was just a purse, then again
I never seen a purse
Get took as personal as this
Don't make it worse
Don't make it worse than what it is
I spent a church
I spent a church on a Benz
I lost my shirt
Least now, we playing shirts and skins
Shift to reverse
And thеn you skrrt off again
Lewinsky, treat me likе the President
Don’t look at me like I need medicine
Don't care what you heard
Don't care what you heard, CNN
Even friends got a E-N-D at the end
You might also like
Selfish, I just want you all to my own
These— these b— won't leave me alone
Damaged by the fact I'm alone
Selfish, I just want you all to my own
These— these b— won't leave me alone
Damaged by the fact I'm alone29Embed
