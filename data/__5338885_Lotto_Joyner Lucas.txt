Mally Mall

It's my birthday, I'm 'bout to get lit-lit (Lit-lit)
Might blow a bag on the drip-drip (Drip)
Make it all back on a quick flip, ayy (Ayy)
I just need cake and a thick bitch, ayy (Ayy)
I ain't have much, just a wishlist (A wishlist)
Now the broke nigga doin' big shit (Big shit)
I got the gun lock, loaded, I'm ignant
So keep one eye open like Slick Rick (Brra, brra-brra)
I got the drip game, nigga, I'm the big mane (Big mane)
Switch lanes on 'em, hit the mid range (Mid range)
Keep the big strap on me like a hitman (Brra)
It go "click-clack, willow-wallow, bing bang" (Brr-brra)
I ain't never been shit, ain't shit changed (Shit changed)
But niggas get lame when you get fame (Brra)
Can't sleep at night 'til I get brains
Got a mean ass pipe and a dick game

I got a bitch on my sofa (Sofa)
I got a chip on my shoulder (Shoulder)
You gotta live with your karma
And if you get hurt then you got what you supposed to (Boom)
I got hitters all over (Over), told 'em this is all over (All over)
I take the kids on drugs and line 'em all up and get 'em all sober (Woo)
You might also like
I got a little check that I cashed out, ayy (Ayy)
Credit card maxed out, ayy (Ayy)
I get lit then I act out, ayy (Ayy)
I ain't wanna do it but I blacked out, ayy (Woo)
They say I need to be safe (Safe)
I think I need to be straight
Fix your vibes, you need to be laced
You just need God or you need to meet Mase
I left my bitch, maybe we just need space (Space)
I got gunners like Chris, like Niecey (Like me)
I got brothers like Tip, like Breezy (Like Breezy)
I got stunners like Wayne, like BG (Okay)
I got a hood bitch all about the bread
And she only give me head 'cause the bed too squeaky (Too squeak)
I'm too smart for a ho tryna G me
A bitch be dumb if she ever try to leave me, word

I say, uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Moreno, gringo, hembra, vato
Gangsters, hustlers, killers follow
I'm the realest nigga, I know (Brrra, brra-brra, ooh)
I just hit the fuckin' lotto, oh (Ooh, ooh)

Why do I feel like Manson? (Oh-oh)
Smoke y'all niggas, I feel like I just got cancer, ayy (Ayy)
Murderin' streets, my anthem
All of y'all clowns is banter, ooh (Banter)
Still can't pull your pants up
Kidnap kids like Amber (Ayy)
Hold a lil' nigga for a ransom (Ooh)
I moved from the trap to the mansion (Mansion)
Went from the Uber to a Phantom (Word)
You niggas gassed up, don't amp 'em
I've never been pretty, but my mom think I'm handsome (Yeah)
I hate niggas that flex on camera (Camera)
Lil' kids always tryna throw tantrums (Yeah)
All you motherfuckas dry like dandruff
You can get washed and I'll throw you in a hamper

I got a bitch on my sofa (Sofa)
I got a chip on my shoulder (Shoulder)
You gotta live with your karma
And if you get hurt then you got what you supposed to (Yeah)
I got hitters all over (All over), told 'em this is all over (All over)
I take the kids on lean and get 'em all clean and give 'em all soda (Bah)

Watch how I do it, I demonstrate, ooh (Ooh)
I ain't gotta move, I renovate
I don't really pray, I meditate, yeah (Woah)
I ain't gotta jump, I levitate
Always on time, I'm never late (Ayy)
I was outside like every day
Tryna turn water into lemonade
Now I'm boo'd up like Ella Mai, I just wanna get away, woah (Oh)
You don't want war with a rich nigga (Rich nigga)
You should hit the gym, get a bit bigger (Oh)
I ain't got patience for bitch niggas (Oh)
Wrap you in the basement with Big Tigger (Big Tigger)
Your bitch is a thot, you had kids with her (Kids with her)
Your watch little lit, but my wrist litter (Ayy)
He thought he had a plan 'til the fist hit him (Ooh)
(He thought he had a plan 'til the fist hit him)
