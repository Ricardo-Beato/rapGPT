All Money In (All Money In, All Money In)
Yuh, real shit
Cookin' Soul

A million, a million-million, a million
A million, a million-million, a million

I got my mind on a million 'fore I turn 26
But that's just what it costs for that condo at the Ritz
I got this European belt (Belt), European bitch
Ever seen an African in a European whip?
I got my top off in traffic playin' this, got 'em pissed
Police hot 'cause my operations legit, suck my dick
All my life they've been shootin', thank god they miss
I'm convinced that I'm here for a reason, it don't make sense, how they miss?
All my niggas is gone, but I still exist (I exist)
So I got on my knees and I told him this (I repent)

One in a million, a million-million, a million
That's real talk
One in a million, a million-million, a million
We made it

I got my first hundred thousand 'fore I turned 22
And then I went to jail for some shit I did not do
Them niggas think it's rap, huh, 'til bullets make 'em back up
Know I'm in them movies, bro, but I am not no actor
Way before these contracts, I knew I was all that
Bet she say Nip Hussle if you ask her where that bomb at
She don't even smoke weed, she's just high off contact (All Money In)
Way before I launched that I understood the concept
Got it from my bro, bro, never drove a six-four
Used to push that Cut, dawg, but now I drive that Benzo
I don't got no girlfriend 'cause, baby, I'm against those
We say that we just friends, but really know that is one in a

A million-million, a million
A million, a million-million
Oh yeah, Hussle
One in a million (One in a, one in a)
A million
A million, a million-million

Look, I'm from Westside California, they run up on ya
Ask you where you from and check yo' tats under yo' clothin'
Hustla, go hard make sure my knot swollen
Fuck it, say the wrong hood, bullets explodin'
I trust few people these days 'cause that's golden
I seen niggas get killed for who they roll with
And chose to keep inside they circle
Satan sittin' on your sofa
Same nigga that shot you was the one you used to smoke with
Cold shit, my whole clique notorious
You've heard of us, six Os is murderers
You still servin' clucks, jealous nigga, you broke as fuck
Yo bitch on my nuts, spillin' Patr√≥n out my cup
She can't get enough, buffer me down as I puff on the finest kush
They say I be doin' too much, I just do my stuff
Yeah, I just do my stuff
Hussle, Hussle

Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch

I got Slauson on my back, Ed Hardy on my hip
Weight of the world on my shoulders, gold rollie on my wrist
Neighborhood chucks, blue checkerboard tint
Dickies saggin' off my ass, walk with a hoodsta limp
Two bricks on my white tee, same color cocaine
I ain't talkin' dope, I mean the price of my gold chain
All money in, no money out, that was my slogan
What I mean by that is stack it up and don't spend no change
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Seven grams was thirty rocks, that was my program
The block propane, young nigga, no change
Shoot-out with no aim, so they know yo name
'Cause where yo mama paid rent, that was yo gang
So when yo homeboy bled, that was yo pain
And if y'all both catch a case, you don't say no names
That's just the code of the color of my shoe strings

This ain't livin' (Hustle, nigga)
This ain't livin, no

Look
What happened to the code? Streets all in shambles
Niggas powderin' they nose, put the shame to what we stand for
They think we on some kill another nigga shit
We really on some stay down and diligent
The streets is cold, turn innocence to militants
Young niggas gangbangin' for the thrill of it
Pops was gone, moms was never home
But the streets was right there so they took you as they own

Niggas still talking bad but they got they whole swag from me
And I wish a nigga would try and pass on me

I fuck with who I fuck with and that's that homie (YEAH!)
100 thousand on my chain and piece
Bitches love to see you shine and I aim to
Please
This world turned a nigga violent but I came in peace
And keep it real until I kill this game, I just ain't complete
She ain't gone make it to the suite if she ain't a freak
Get crackin' in the backseat so she ain't for me
She tried to hit me that wait and see
Told her hope out and get a blunt then I got in the breeze
That type of shit that make me laugh brody
And I ain't met a bitch yet that can swag on me
Mascara tracks but she asked for em
Now I just home she got some cab money

Now am I out here on my grind? that's fasho
Mind on my money, seven days twenty-fo

It ain't nothing to be done out here that I ain't done before

And money over bitches is the motto
Still some of these suckers think I owe him a dollar or a dime
I'm a product of my grind, fuck is on your mind
When you talk I don't listen cause a lot of niggas lie
Rule 1 gotta get gotta flip gotta find your position while you in a south central state of mind

They mad cause I can, and I'm happy cause they can't
Yeah, I'm happy cause they can't
It's that feel good, you know

Shout out to my enemies, shout out to the facts

But imitation is the highest form of humility

Take her to the turf, she trynna take me to her church

Take advantage of everything granted, just keep it coming
On my off day they might accuse me of stuntin'
A-1 credit I don't co-sign nothing
Admit it I'm addicted, can't stop hustlin'
Went from blending in, now my lifestyle's custom
Bail money set aside, I ain't gonna touch it
Motivated nigga, make 'em reconsider something
Lot of niggas hustle, can't keep up with the money
Gotta grind through the winter, to make it to the summer
A risk you gotta take when you on it like I want it
Transition out the game, no longer see opponents
Now I see a business and I'm lookin' like the owner
Handle business from a distance, I don't know 'em, I don't wanna
Snitches on the prowl, matter of fact around the corner
The punishment is heavy and it's getting even stronger
Money coming steady, by the way it's even longer
Take a glimpse at my diploma, graduate as a honor
I'm out here gettin' dollars, and they act like it's a problem
I'm all about a win, losing never was an option
That explains all that champagne bottle popping

Imagine that to transition from Slauson to my position got a deal went to jail my bro wus fresh up out of prison
And niggas looked like I f*ck off wut I was givin
But the truth is I'm not used to this new way I make my livin

Wassup, Loc? Shit, I'm just out here tryna make it
Moms keep trippin' and a nigga can't take it
Sick of standing on these same corners, tryna come up
Finna run up in the bank, hold my motherfuckin' gun up
Life, got a nigga so frustrated
All my real niggas is dead or incarcerated
Finna fill a nigga with lead
Show 'em what they made me
Give 'em what they gave me back
Feel my hatred
Click-clack-pop, was addicted to the six shot
Fiennin' for a fix like a smoker on the Vic' block
Hoppin' out, getting high when the shit pop
Leaving bullet holes in the bricks in front of Big Lots
When I was broke, I hustled

Never tell a bitch your plans or bring her to the house
Don't speak about a man, keep his name out your mouth
See, that'll be the shit that'll get a nigga knocked off
Not the pussy, but the principal, 'cause jealousy is a felony
Now when you grinding, nigga, dress bummy, fuck clothes
Ask yourself, are you in it for the money or the hoes
You content with a cutlass or you reaching for a rolls?
You straight up on them stocks says you fucking with them foes
I seen them quarters turn to halves, and halves to wholes
And now we hit the mall, we buy half the store

Let's get rich, bro, it's time to get some big dough
Sunday nights on the 'Shaw niggas rich roll
I used to only want to hit a switch and flip hoes
Now I'm thinking bigger, man, it's time to get home
On the East Side, I used to buy stress and flip zones
108, late night, I pray I get home
A lot of niggas die young, they never got to get old

Pull up thick to that function
Pull out guns and start bussin'
'Cause niggas not with no fussin'
Roll up kush and shoot hunneds
And take your bitch like its nothin'
We was living fast, we was rushin'
Niggas burnt and crashed on that dumb shit
And it was fuckin' sad 'cause we was puppets
Had to learn so fast to switch hustles
And my bag, that‚Äôs $1200
And my fucking pad is illustrious
And I‚Äôd still kill one of you niggas
'Cause I‚Äôm not really for the fuck shit
And we was raised around hustlers
Rolex chains and K‚Äôs bussin'
Super Sports and boxed Cutlass
And pull off fast and burn rubber
Pull out cash like it‚Äôs nothin'

Tipped a hundred dollars when the valet grabbed my keys
I'm runnin' through this money like these hundreds is adidas
They hatin' and we see why
We riders and we fly
You niggas is neither, you know the procedure
Hustle 'til we run out and then count cash and re-up
High 'til we die so it's motherfuckin' detox
The only thing we run is Louis belts through our Levi's
Catch me at the function, hoppin' out dumb thick
All these hoes wanna fuck but all I got is one dick
Expense, one more chance, all I need is one Nip
And all my competition on some I can't even front shit

They wavin' their white flag and I'm still bussin' my gun
No surrender, no retreat, my nigga, I got to eat

Foldin' clothes, washin' dishes, got me through them cold Decembers
Told 'em it'd be better days, so that explains the shit I'm into
I kept my word but details is confidential
Not too many niggas have survived the type of shit I've been through
And even less is this nice on an instrumental
Minus the pencil, just the info
They tell me that it's all a mind game, so I play this shit mental
They see the platinum plates and they assume that it's a rental
'Cause his album's yet to drop so how he pull up in a Benzo?
Drop the top, bet the bitch got crop
Let it blow in the wind on a roll, don't stop
Yah, yah, the next stop will be the block
Grab a fat stack of weed, then we hopped on a yacht

Look
Don't ever talk about the shit I'm 'bout to do
Don't ever lie to hoes, I just tell the truth
Don't ever put the pussy on a pedestal
This money is the motive, everything after the revenue
I swear to God that's what you better do
Cause in this life it ain't no tellin' what's ahead of you
These niggas done went federal
From young reppable niggas killin' it's all sectional
Now this is the reality we wrestle with
Where every nigga down to die for what he represent
Where every murder is a mission rooted in revenge
You make it out alive in one piece you set precedent
And then you start accumulating presidents
You lookin' like a legend especially when your record spins
Then you pull up in a six with a set of twins
And like I never thought I'd see you in the set again

Please
I'm gettin' paid, but that ain't change nothin'
Look
I'm gettin' cheese, but that ain't change nothin'

The bitches that I seen when I laid it out
The only important thing is the paper route
The motto I embody the prophecy as I play it out
Smilin' faces rockin' diamond bracelets
Murder cases that's probation when your pockets make ya
I'm stuntin' or something that cost a lot of paper
I ain't fuckin' with nothin' that don't look like a spaceship
And that's the realest shit I ever spoke
Pull up in the shopping center with a centerfold
My windows up, my ceilings closed
Chopper still on me if you didn't know

And at this point, just take it to the next level
Niggas they grindin' so hard
Came so far
Travel the world

All I do is rap about the fast life
You can't relate, you need to get your cash right
I must have been a flashlight in my last life
Because all I do is shine so blow me like a bagpipe
Woodgrain, grams, and gold chains
I'm shutting down traffic I'm switching four lanes
I'm hanging out the window every which way
Every nigga not a pimp but every bitch pay
I'm hard on these hoes like every single day
And I gotta lot of bitches in a lot of different states
I get a lot of pussy but I never got to pay
And all money in is all a nigga got to say
Now one time for my young grind
I spend hundreds I smoke quarters and fuck dimes
Got no love for broke bitches with no drive
I dropped out but I done fine
Right, I know you heard about them stages I've been murdering
Lighting my swishers up as they roll in my room servicing
Them shopping sprees all the fly shit I'm purchasing
Tattoos on my face because now I know I'll never work again

Where your real dogs that love you, not them fake cats?
Where them girls that got your name as a face tat?
Know you by your first, can't replace that
Beefin' with your niggas, so you stay strapped
Believe me it's religious, where your grace at?
Jumping off the porch, where your faith at?
Where the blocks where you made your plays at?
I put Slauson on the map, you gotta face facts
Kept it hood like six braids and blue wave caps
Said I couldn't but I did, you can't change that
You can hate it, you can love it, I don't change, jack

Hate it or love it

To pulling up in young drops, and park in front the drug spots
Look at how your young popped, look at how these youngs flock
Looking out my living room, like, "Hell no, I won't stop"
All I need is one shot, that's just how we was taught
Sitting in a circle all silent, that's 'cause funds talk
Desperation rubbed off, found myself, I was lost
Sketched it out, architect, the blueprint of a young boss

It's like a constant, it's like gravity, you know
You don't have faith in the ground
You just know when you put your feet on it it's gon' stand solid
And that's how I feel about music2Embed
Fuck diss tracks, you get your shit splat
Before you ever heard me rap, I had to spit crack
Slimy rocks, CRASH thought they'd find me shot
But doing numbers like Def Jam in the '90s pot
Much to they surprise I'm the fuckin' flyest
In the Chevy nigga playin' Pac, nigga, "Still I Rise"
Blue rag around my forehead, code red
Slauson Ave. infiltrate rap to take more bread
Quote it how you want, I just rolled a blunt
I'm sippin' lean in first class gettin' my shoulders rubbed
Streets talkin' so I'm listening with a loaded gun
Still all I hear is niggas sayin' I'm the chosen one
Champagne open one, watch it over-run
I heard him say a drunk mind speak a sober tongue
We're still adjusting to the changes
I've been gettin' money but it's different when you famous
It been niggas famous but it's different when you bangin'
All these niggas hatin', all these police tryna hang you
What should you do? Decisions, your blood racing
Fresh out the county, tryna go platinum on probation
But no regrets, my nigga, just more bank
Just soak it all out, double back from both angles
Artists, their label, no favors, no thank you
And rap about it all just to lace you
Pull up in cars with blunts large like Jamaicans
Sticky from bell sells, white broads named Rachel
Never broke code and I never made statements
So the rules say, mute all false speculation
Greatness fooly, four words: self made, salute me
A lot of niggas watching now probably hate this movie, but fuck 'em
I'm so tired of the same discussion

Still proud of what I look at in the mirror life
Hyde Park hustle, half-baked on a Paris flight

Earl grey, mother of pearl face
Forever I'm the flyest, we fuck on Chanel sheets
Count cash after shows, I spazzed on the globe
I passed all my goals, then I mapped out some more
On this neverending road, I fix flats in the cold, boy
Respect how I master my role
And I made it all happen alone

Me, I get cake and I don't speak for them niggas that can't
Hussle the great, setting up shop or runnin' in banks
Fuck did you think? I would slow that? Fuck is you sayin'
Niggas was playin', me I just went from a bucket to Benz
Up in the pen where they predicted I'll be up in ten
Humble begins, but now I stunt sound hard it don't make no sense
Fly to Japan, they pay me in cash, convert it to yen
Bitch, I'm the man, bitch, I'm the man, bitch I'm the man
Go get yo' friend, I fucked you already can't fuck you again
Bitch, I'm the man, bitch, I'm the man, I'll say it again
Pay me in cash, fly to Japan and convert it to yen

Everything custom sittin' on chrome, yeah that's my fate
Look at my pace, marathon life now look at my race
Look at where I started
Look at my state, got 'em lookin' my way
What could you say?
If it ain't salute, I got it lookin' like hate
Lookin' like why? Some things in life you just can't debate
You just can't relate, never drove cars from state to state
With a truck full of pounds and a 38
In a "I gotta get it type urgency," nah
Top third degree, ten toes in it like a pair of sneaks
Turf trick, he need a pair of cleats
Still I stayed down and emerged a beast
Out of town, I done worked for a week
Let a young nigga splurge in peace
We fuckin' up Lenox just me and my niggas
We ballin' like Nino and G
Was driving my Regal in heat
Caprone had kilos for cheap
Was rollin', but niggas was deep
The block was conjunct to my legal release
Was rappin' and now it's so sweet
They actually bow to my feet
The women around me is freaks
The money is long, my power is deep
Look at my car
Look at my girl look like a star

Most the time, when it rain it start pouring'
But how we grind, it make the weather change for us
(repeat 3x)
We roll through, but we never change for 'em
So smile for us, when you see us, drive foreigns

Nigga watch us ball
Stop or stall, nigga not at all
I'm poppin' broads with Tiny Hog at the shoppin' mall
All money in the squad, boy I'm not involved
Can't pay the cost to floss? I can spot your flaws
SLs with the toppin' off
Dress well when it's time to ball
Couple hundred for my boxer drawers
Young nigga used to shop at Ross
First to shoot when it's poppin' off
Couple times, a nigga almost got popped by Ross
Crash unit, buzz cut ex-marines
Crenshaw, Slauson Ave 17
Infant Stone, Lil' Shady, Baby Bolt Da Fatts laid a demonstration
85 Cutlass with the 380s
Summertime functions, L.A. streets' crazy
Shoot it out that's what this crew about
Hangin' out the Cutlass window with the Rugar out
Prove yo'self, killers in pursuit of clout
It felt wrong, but who is you to doubt
Look, my master plan was buy a pound and then move it south
And hopefully one day I'll put this music out
Trippin' now, seeing that it's movin' out
I'm buying spots, nigga movin' out
My fan base, I see 'em movin' south
I'm overseas eating fuckin' cro√ªte
Yeah‚Ä¶ so I can tell you what this hustling 'bout
I couldn't tell you what no luck about
I had maps on my wall, nigga
Dope sacks in my drawers, nigga
Look, a lot of stress I couldn't rest not at all
Nigga risking everything trynna ball

Gotta let it breathe
And put the weed out
Double M

Niggas get it and they fall off
It's cause they all soft
Nigga like me started at the car wash
8am to 10pm, that's on the rainy day
Wise words from dope boys meant everything
They say it's levels to the street life
Then I seen a bezel with the pink ice
All natural, momma tell you to be careful
In the trap trappin' to increase capital
No longer cruising with the windows down
Hand on the pistol anticipating the riddle sound
I'm Kanye when it came to 'ye
I'm Jay-Z when it came to keys
I'm Snoop when it came to weed
So now they wanna Biggie me
As the credit rolls, now the charge is federal
Money bags, I'm placed upon a pedestal
Still on the block in my Reeboks
You ain't really know these was the Basquiat's
You ain't really know who really call shots
Worldwide mastermind, number one all charts
Reporting live from the land of the hopeless
Representing for the team that won rings with no coaches
We stay strapped and we cockin' so don't approach us
Price Johnson with a big gold chain and Louis Loafers
Been hiding guns in the sofa since toy soldiers
Thunder-domes up in Hyde Park, didn't nobody know us
We took all fades, our introduction was from the shoulders
We was kids, honestly we just needed someone to hold us
Grindin' hard on them corners with cane boulders
Fascinated by the green, all we wanted was Range Rovers
On the block politicking with brain blowers
Real niggas that got love in their hearts but can't show it
We live and die for the fame and the lights glowing
Fox Hills buying Jordans, but still the pain showing
When I die, put me next to the dead poets
Tell 'em God had a plan for me and I didn't know it

Yo, yo, Ralo
Han, look

I'm like
Follow my steps, and you see what I'm bout
I keep that money coming in and never going out
You wanna fuck a fly nigga that you heard about
I beat that pussy up until it's watered down
She call me once a day to see if I'm around
But 9 times out of 10 I'm probably out of town
I told you ease up you more persistent now
I'm fronting though cuz if you stopped I'd probably miss the sound
Somewhere in between us it's attraction and I see that
You make me wanna make you tat my name up on your cleavage
I know it's just a song but when it stop I'm still gon' mean it
Sent your picture to my ex, told her this is why I'm leaving look
Couple stacks in my pocket and I'm fiending
To down a glass of Reisling and go blow it at Neiman's
Hop in the coupe I know that ass will fill my seats in
Something decent then ride to the remix

Gyu Kaku, hot shots and cold fish
Pints of dolce and coconut Ciroc fifths
Living drama free, Roosevelt cabana suites
TMZ questions me about my strands of weed
I like to vacation on Miami beach
Couple homies from the set, some Atlanta freaks
Used to have them pounds cheap in 2003
Most of the niggas from back then in penitentiaries
And now they see me on they TV like "how can it be?"
It's complicated how I made it like Avril Lavigne
That's why they rooting for me, I'm speaking what they think
Without no pieces I could show you how to build a dream

Look, relate to you, I can't if you's a fake nigga
Where Level 4 in the state what your mistakes get you
Rap niggas, they just wanna double date with you
Twitpic and show these hoes that they affiliate with you
Labels used to treatin' rappers like a slave, nigga
Starvin' artist, "Just be happy with your fame, nigga"
Shit changed, now it's such a different game
All the niggas like myself is controlling everything
If you, pay attention see exactly what I mean
Fuck the middleman, I said that in 2003
Was 18, White Lincoln, chrome feet
Black .40 was my pillow, every night I go to sleep
Grown niggas treat me like they OG
Holdin' on to every word that the tiny loc speaks
I had a vision that nobody else could see
Sold my shit to D-Mac, a little less than 10 Gs
Brought my grocery bag of cash back to Blacc Sam
He matched a nigga, next day we went to Sam Ash
We bought a Pro Tools and a microphone
Studio was far from plush but them lights was on
Couple hunned thousand stashed at my mama's home
Real estate in Atlanta, but ain't nobody know
Mac 11s in the safe, hidden in the floor
My bro did it like nobody that I've ever known
Screens on every wall with 16 camera angles
Double pane bulletproof glass pushin' past the haters
Cuban links and Rolexes, fold a check from Epic
This industry ain't gotta like us but they gon' respect it
Built the label up from money we was savin' up
No details 'til the statute of limitations up
Couple niggas got flipped tryna play with us
The demonstrations speak loud so I ain't sayin' much
Was a charismatic nigga, I don't play as much
'Cause life is real when you live it in a place like us
School pictures crackin' smiles, now my face is stuck
Shell shocked to see how much they really hated us
Couldn't keep a kind heart, get yo' hatred up
Streets smarts, nigga, get yo information up
Watching Belly, smokin blunts, take Jamaican puffs
One day I'ma have a house and car like Jamaican cuz
Credits roll, back to stress pound breakin' up
Had to fight before we hustled, and it made us tough
Early '90s, neighbor's rooster used to wake us up
Mama had a bucket and a shack but we ain't make a fuss
Blue Cutlass, no license, .380 tucked
'96 Caprice 'Bolt Da Fatts' was savin up

I could tell a gang of reasons or just say I'm faithful

They don't really give a fuck long as I just keep pacing
Quiet for a year, gave no explanation
Now I'm 'bout to drop, I got 'em on that Proud 2 Pay shit
Half of a million cash, he gon' offer me a label
Told him that I need to own it, so I'm cool, kept it gangster
Holla back, real niggas what you calling that
You see the game fucked up, look, what part is that

They put me in the Getty, I'm a artifact
They can't never hang me on the wall, though

Victory Lap, nigga, this Marathon
Still don't stop though
Count me up, count me up

I'm used to people doubting I'd amount to much
I thrive off the challenge, I'm a childish fuck
I love toys so I'm by the buck
I hate to lose so I play too rough
I speak my mind and say I say too much
Minus the hip-hop, cops say I don't say enough

And all them real niggas wish the best for me
All these bad bitches got some sex for me
Shout out them bad bitches getting dressed for me

Pull up to my shows in Chanel purses
They jeans fit the worst but they smell perfect

We still them same niggas that we used to be
Blacc Sam in that sedan in the coupe is me
Hundred thousand for the car so the roof was free
While I'm in it flashback on how it used to be
Wildin', nigga, can't relax, it was the youth of me
That make a smoker buy the bullets for a shooting spree
Found myself, same time family losing me
But all that violence from the past is what produced a G
All the real L.A. niggas know the truth is me
No hotline, homie, I could tell your future free
Get on your Marathon 'til you bruise ya feet
Or run the streets 'til the reverend write ya eulogy
Fishbowl in the six with all my jewelry
'Cause I heard my haters is supposed to be shooting me
I'll never let a broke bitch influence me
Slauson Ave, getting money and the proof is me

'Cause I tell everybody all the time
Own your masters, own your catalog
Can't none of these niggas say they own their masters and their catalog
If they do, they're lying to you
Or they gon' say own some of it or they gon' buy it back
All that is bullshit
Just had to get our little thing together
We picked up distribution
Now we're strong, now we're legit, naw'mean
And we're a force to be reckoned with right now, word up11Embed
I'm smoking backs with OG
Pulled the carpet up, made mahogany low key
Know these niggas jealous, envious of my whole team
But I‚Äômma kill these niggas broad day if it‚Äôs on me
Fully bossed up, niggas pockets need protein
I ain‚Äôt had much but you gotta chase your dream
Wrote it all down in my spot in like ‚Äò03
10 years later, big shout to my whole team
We gon fly to Africa, we gon stop in Rome first
Exchange a 100k, and then buy the whole store
And we buy the whole floor, fuck it I just want more
Look I got fans everywhere, we need a globe tour
And I need 100k in stock, that‚Äôs a low score
Bitches gotta talk less, fiends that'll hold more
Bank accounts with less tax, overseas on show floors
Foreign shit, steering wheels opposite like Tom Boys
Only real niggas, V12‚Äôs in my convoy
All black tint, bad bitches, Mardi Gras boy (yeah)
Take ya top off, I'll give you some beads ho
I could turn your block to a free flow
Half-court shot to a freethrow
Impossible is nothing, Nike flow
It‚Äôs all in yo mind, it‚Äôs cerebral
I smoke so much weed, I should read more
Made so much cash I don't need dough
I ate so much food that I feed more
So tired of this place, that I leave more
And when you this fly, nigga wings grow
Can‚Äôt call it cloud 9 til my team know
50 stores up, blowing racks in casinos
And I got Ginger with me
Grind hard til it benefit me
Shine hard, nigga literally
Only day ones and my killers with me
And them hoes like kill 'em Nipsey
You see me out shopping, they be like what‚Äôs poppin ay?

Yea all this stress on my brain right
Poker face, I‚Äôm in the game right
Need a week to think, maybe 8 nights
Some promethazine and a straight flight
Let me cut off my phone, let me get in my zone
Let me center myself, just leave a nigga alone
I be back in a few, got some rappin' to do
Got some stacking still runnin', got some lapping to do
All, Jokes to the side, nigga know that they ain‚Äôt fucking with the flow I provide
Y'all, notice how I started and now a flow has evolved
And me and Ralo Styles like Wade and Lebron
And it‚Äôs all money in and your bros is in charge
Hoes in m√©nage for those rose carte blanche
In them out of town suites ‚Äòcus they know we the ones
Equity nigga, what ive chosen, of course
No 360‚Äôs, clothing and tour
When I do drop I‚Äômma blow past niggas
And I toe tag niggas like I told 'em before
Got flow, got whores
Got dough, get more
Fuck mine, get yours
And the show just started, nigga hold your applause
Tryna get to my spot
Look, you gotta go up floors
I put the 6 on stock, I was runnin' through tires like chicks on tour
And if im at the game, you can bet your bottom dollar that I sit on floor
And if im at the fight, you can bet your bottom dollar sweat hit my whore

You almost made it little nigga you was right there
Now your release date is in another light year
Yea, and it‚Äôs quite clear
All you needed was a little bit of guidance
And your household it was just silence
You was your own mother and your father
How the hell you supposed to know what to do when nobody showed you the ropes
All they showed you was pistols and dope
Gang flags in the land with no hope
Where every fitted hat mean a different hood
Make it out & they still want you in the hood
Your own homies don't want you livin good
Niggas for they self, get it understood
Its just a playground full of mood swings
Die for the color of your shoe strings
Wish I had a different way to view things
You either had a rap hook or a hoop dream
From El Segundo to Slauson
Me and Nipsey, we young bosses
Never takin' no losses
Check the garments nigga, life's marvelous

We still up all night
And I breathe your air
Runnin' this marathon
You only can...

Look, now, I can't promise commitment, but I swear we'll have fun
If you, ask I'll be honest, girl, you not the only one
Just a man on a mission, with my hand on my gun
Couple niggas that hate me, but way more people show love
Niggas tryin' too hard, they dyin' to ball
Then turn around and hate on me like it's a crime to evolve
Too afraid to be different, too ashamed to just listen
See I'm way too 100, so now they hate on my niggas
Tried to hate on my Crippin', tried to hate on my business
Not to call you a bitch, but they gon' hate on my bitches
So if you fucking with Nip, let you know my intentions
Got to think like a rider, you gotta know your position
So if it's cool, then we can hop in my Mercedes coupe
Pop the cork off this imperial Veuv'
Crank the music, blowin' circles out the roof
And just enjoy the view

Knew it's all in due time, now hundreds stackin' like Tetris
Hustle hard is my message, then double back and get extras
Know I spaz when I catch it

Look, I got a Ruger and a Bryco
But I'ma let you pick which way tonight go
I got my dough right, plus the right dough
I mean it's legal, pay taxes to them white folks
My procedure, stay crackin 'til my life's low
Then when I die, blue rag around my rifle
Hundred thousand in my coffin, that's just light though
Play a Stevie Wonder song, smoke some flight, bro
Crack a pint of Act then pour in some Sprite, bro

Longwinded, running through this life like it was mine
Never settling, but setting every goal high
One thousand burpees on the path to my own destruction or success
But what is a mistake without the lesson?
See, the best teacher in life is your own experience
None of us know who we are until we fail
They say every man is defined by his reaction to any given situation
Well who would you want to define you?
Someone else or yourself?
Whatever you do, homie, give your heart to it
And stay strong

Lot of niggas fail, but I won't
Lot of niggas fold, but I cope
Lot of niggas gone, but I'm home
Lot of niggas off, but I'm on
Lot of niggas lost on this road
Couple niggas gave up their goal
Gang of niggas traded their soul
But me, I'm standin' on ten toes
Lookin' out my Benz window
Wonder where'd my friends all go
Scared to give my heart to this girl

These old rules came with no questions
Wrong to live by them but it's no exceptions
Was young and reckless with loaded weapons
The code of ethics lead to self destruction
When it's over, you left with nothing
This life ain't it boy, better check the subtext
Or the fine print, felt entitled to this fly shit
Felt like every bad bitch should be on my dick
Felt like niggas lied to us on some fraud shit
Fuck it, that's just how the ball bounce on some boss shit

Come take a walk in my shoes
Just some young niggas makin' millionare moves
Everything to gain we ain't got nothin' to lose
If you tryna get money nigga this is what ya do
Gotta hustle gotta grind yea (this is what ya do)
Gotta hustle gotta grind yea (this is what ya do)
Gotta hustle gotta grind yup (this is what ya do)
If you tryna get money nigga this is what ya do look

Stay down city, yea
You gotta stay off in the trap till a nigga make a killin'
It don't matter what he dealin'
Cause the money spend the same
Once it all stack up, then ask me how I'm feelin'
Addin' up expenses, a luxury tax
A 40 inch gold chain and some brand new denim
You don't see how he do, starin' in my rearview
Speedin' in the lane, tryna feel what the gears do
Take a walk in my 10.5's
And you'll see what he did just to get at the cash
Real niggas take risks just to fill up rubber bands
With them big face Benjamins, you don't know the half, and
We don't ever ask, we just go hard and smash
Stay in love with lifestyle, it's far from a fad
And I'm far from a class, but I'm still doin' math nigga
I'm rich and infamous, don't care what the judge figures2Embed
Aye
Writing songs for my dogs, for my squad, from my heart
How we won, how we lost
How we came, how we saw
Through it all, ashin' Backs, out the roof, foreign cars
In pursuit by the law
Still we reach for the stars
Go for broke, hustle hard X4You might also likeEmbed

Cause I know how takin' L's taste

You Know, some things just got to be said
Marathon Music, uh

Look, you don't a clue of what you want to do
I'm busy gettin' rich, you think that I'm gon' stop for you?
I built this on my own and everybody know it's true
Still niggas act like they supposed to have control of what I do
But look, they don't got a clue of what I been through
Nigga ain't have no trust funds or eat off no silver spoons
Nigga ain't have no peace inside my house until I moved
And I damn sure can't recall havin' no exit route in you
But really, I don't got a clue of what you even do
And what good is a dream if you can't make yo shit come true?
What good is a team when everyone depends on you?
Hope opportunity don't knock, what opportunist in yo group?
'Cause then what you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
'Cause if you sharin' your success and not your struggle, you's a fool
Then you start to look like food, the game don't even chew
Eat you up and shit you out and then them critics say you through
But look, they don't got a clue what you was tryna do
Keepin' it one hunnid, one hunnid don't keep it you
But I'm gon' tell you what to do
Here is what you do
Say, "fuck the middle-man," get on your marathon and get your loot
I hustle 'cause I have to, not because it's cool
And over time became accustomed to the bullshit niggas do
Now I'm numb and it's cool, had to bounce back and regroup
Hope you don't expect shit from me, 'cause I don't want shit from you

Doin' it with no punch, you feel me...
Look, lifestyles of the young, rich and famous
Money over everything, underneath the interest
I stay strapped cause they never stop hatin'
And I never stop grindin' cause they always want a payment
I pink slipped every whip I ever came in
And always wear a rubber cause these bitches is contagious
So talk money, cause money that's my language
If it ain't that, then nigga don't say shit
Holla at me, I'm prolly a boost some deuce deuces
Chrome feet, leather seats, and the coupe's roofless
A pick of broke niggas, man your crew's useless
You niggas having dollars like we born Jewish
Before rap I made a fortune off the pharmaceutics
And all it took was a Section 8 apartment unit
A mastermind, a little grind, and the heart to do it
Nigga breaking bricks like a martial arts student
Now picture me, blue pradas on a black pavement
Wife beater, blue dickies off my ass hangin'
Trunk bangin', gold chains swangin'

See 'em? Yea, they bury 
You don't want them hollows flyin', bet I got my alibi
Goin' on an exotic island where all the models slidin'
You either ride or hidin', quiet or 'bout it 'bout it
Cakin' or  nigga hustle 'fore you cry about it
I got a crowded closet, chinchilla should be
Gated in leather, and my vehicle's 260
What up, Nipsey? Soon as I hit the west I know you
Comin' through to get me with a groupie and a blickie
Quarter P sticky cause I smoke like a hippie

Thang grippin' my grain, paint drip as a drain
Dip in the lane, slain, slip and you crash
Fuck with Nip and the clip'll clap quick as a stripper's ass
My hoodie's a skeleton equipped with the zipper mask
And I wear to help me see through to my temper task
Got us a jabberjaw, talk or jab and his jibs slip
Resulted to give his jibs a jab
I'm all about the guap comma, the hot dollar
The mozzarella, the parmesan, the piccata
The cheddar, the whole guada
Strip shitty, skip cities for trips, kiddies
With henny fifths, plenty fiddies to skinny dip titties
Trying to get this money, dot point, simple as dot point
Make it simple, I got point, you know about it

Out the garage is how you end up in charge

Nip told you, "Fuck the middleman," I told you, "Fuck a bitch"
Fuck wearing they clothes, I wear my own shit
Y'all can own y'all label, I own my own, bitch
Ayy, Nip, I remember all that game you throwed me
Don't fuck around and get played by these label owners
Talk that shit to these niggas, Adrien Broner
But secure the win, though, don't let that game fold you

Girl, your sex the best, hickies on your neck
Love the way you dress, plus that pussy wet
Do it 'til you sweat, and your hair a mess
Have you late for work, but you could care less
You been livin' more, you been lettin' go
You been havin' fun, just to let me know
That you down to ride, you down to roll
You know the game and how it go

Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could (Oh)
Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could
Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could

I'm prolific, so gifted
I'm the type that's gon' go get it, no kiddin'
Breaking down a Swisher front of your buildin'
Sitting on the steps, feeling no feelings
Last night, it was a cold killin'
You gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga
But you know how it go, nigga
I'm front line every time it's on, nigga
Hunnid proof flow, run and shoot pro
458 drop, playin' "Bullet Proof Soul"
Every few shows, I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller, everybody can't go
Downtown, Diamond District, jewelers like, "Yo
Hussle, holla at me, I got Cubans on the low"
Flew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat
Then docked at Tulum just to smoke, look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
I'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it
They tell me, "Hussle, dumb it down, you might confuse 'em"
This ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
I'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section
Can't express how I curved detectives
Guess it's evidence of a divine presence, blessings
Held me down, at times, I seem reckless, F it
You got an L, but got an E for effort, stretched him
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert, then left him
Ain't no answer to these trick questions
Money Makin' Nip, straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known, flick up and jail pose
Snatch a champagne bottle from Rico's 'til T show
Whatever, nigga, playin' chess, not checkers, nigga
Thirty-eight special for you clever niggas
See, bro, if you ain't live and die by the street code
Been through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I wanna hear your CD for?

Find your purpose or you wastin' air
Fuck it, though, y'all niggas scared
Eyes opened, I can see it clear
They don't make 'em bar none, they don't make 'em real
They don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here
They ain't see in due time, I be makin' mils
Bossed up in this game, I been makin' deals
Get your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real
I got checks and balance, I flex dramatic
Other fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit
Ain't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage
I make one phone call and the rest get handled
It's just another front step with candles

Still on Plan A, pussy niggas on Plan B
Right now (Young rich nigga, young rich nigga)
Motherfucker, let's go

Yeah, what could make a nigga wanna go and get it?
Said he want a Bimmer with the subs in it
Said he grew up in the house and it was love missin'
Said he grew up in the set, he keep his gun with him
Young nigga, young nigga (Let's go)
Young (Niggas), just a young nigga

I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga (Your turn)
Remember I was on the run, nigga (Let's go)
Couple years before you had a son, nigga (Let's go)
Open up your doors and kept it one with me
Held a nigga down and that was love, nigga (Let's go)
Nobody wanna stand in front a judge, nigga (Yeah)
Make you think of better days like when you was winnin'
Standin' on the couches in the club with us
(We all in here, you see it motherfucker, young nigga)
Then I got my shot, I had to run with it
Out the gate, lost count
Many days in the studio we slaved, but this shit we gotta say
Staring into space as you fishing for a phrase
Uninspired, in your mind, still, it's all a paper chase
First you overdedicate, then you notice that you great
And you been the whole time, and it slap you in your face
Then you stack it in your safe, got it crackin', it was fate
Now you the definition, nigga, laughin' to the bank
I'm a master of my fate
Plus I'm the type of nigga own the masters to my tapes
In Nevada for the day
I caught a flight from Philly, we just sold out TLA
Fresh up off of stage on my way to B of A
AMB, we LA, tryna eat, we the way
Look, young Nipsey the great
Never taught how to drink, I just lead to the lake
It's eighty-something degrees in LA (Yeah)
Fuck it, time to put some jet-skis on the lake
Look, I got a team in my bank
I don't even need an ID at my bank
This used to be a dream we would chase
I know J. Stone and Cobby Supreme could relate
I know the whole team could relate
I know Evan McKenzie and Bron Lees could relate
Cornell, Saddam, Adam Andebrhan
Steven Donelson and Blacc Sam been on this marathon
Ballin' since my brother used to hustle out the Vons
Couple hundred thousand up, he took a shovel to the lawn
No exaggeration for the content of my songs
When he went to dig it up, shit, a hundred somethin' gone
Molded, you can ask moms
Had to plug in blow dryers for the ones that we could wash (Let's go)
Salvaged a little bit, young rich nigga shit
Pressure on your shoulder, how you gon' deal with it? (Come on)
Say it's uncomfortable (That's right), when you transitionin' (Let's go)

Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'

I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, "You do a song with Nip, K. Dot, he a better Crip"
I said, "He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?"
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up

Look
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, "Stay safe," now it's, "Stay dangerous"
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'

Oh, aw, baby, it's been so long

Mogul and they know that, logo on my floor mat
Courtside, Chamberlain throwback match my Rolex
Everywhere I go, flex, valet park on some Loc shit
Whole lot of smoke in that 'Rari, that thang potent
Burnin' rubber, wearin' cameras, they was undercovers
Under pressure, made statements, turned on they brothers
Never judge you, but the streets'll never love you
I wonder what it come to in your brain for you to run to
Ones that hate us, handcuff us and mace us
Call us dumb niggas 'cause our culture is contagious
Third-generation South Central gangbangers
That lived long enough to see it changin'
Think it's time we make arrangements
Finally wiggle out they mazes
Find me out in different places
I'm the spook by the door, this the infiltration
Double back dressed in blue laces

Oh, aw, baby, it's been so long

'Bout to make my partners look like fuckin' geniuses
We was in the Regal, it was me and Steven
We done took a dream and turned it to a zenith
Anything I wanted, everything I needed
Gotta pace yourself, it's all about your breathin'
You can have it all, it's all about your reasons
I done took my name and carved it in the cement

Oh, aw, baby, it's been so long
Oh, aw, baby, it's been so long

I flashback on that shootout at the beach, twenty deep
You tried to squeeze, your gun jammed and they released
Blood on your tee, how many stains? I see three
The bitch started to panic, so I made her switch seats
Drivin' now, police chopper, hear it flyin' now
Really not too spooked, calmly asked me, "Am I dyin' now?"
All I know is keep you calm and collected
Crackin' jokes like, "Nigga, now you gon' be finally respected"
See your blood leakin', got my foot on this gas
Tossed the 40, we pulled up to Daniel Free and see CRASH
You know the alibi, they started shootin', we was standin' by
Ain't see nothing but the flare from the talons fly
I wasn't there, I was passin' by
Matter fact, don't say shit, I'm just gon' drop you in the back and slide

Choppers a throwaway, hustle the Hova way
That's why they follow me, huh? They think I know the way
'Cause I took control of things, ballin' the solo way
And if you pattern my trend, I make you my protege
Slauson Ave soldier raised, niggas don't know them days
Take you in back of the buildings, make you expose your age
Take you across the tracks, make you explode a face
Now you official now, but you got a soul to save
I just been cookin' that new, I'm 'bout to drop in a few
Think if I call it the great, the people gon' call it the truth
Ain't really trip on the credit, I just paid all of my dues
I just respected the game, now my name all in the news
Trippin' on all of my moves, quote me on this, got a lot more to prove
Remember I came in this bitch fresh out the county with nothin' to lose

And I don't do this for nothin', nah, from the ground up, yeah

Honest attempt, play him to the left

Catch a body in broad day
Catch a body in broad day

I got the key to the city, I got a ho that's saddity

Whack out your hood in graffiti
Come through your hood on the weekly

Y'all ain't got nothin' like this over there
Bunch of front-line millionaires
Bunch of self-made, out the trunk paid
'Gainst the odds, really took it there
Any prob', I'ma reappear, with a squad you already fear
All this time I've been playin' fair, seven digits every single year
Niggas died, niggas disappeared, alibis, I was really there
Life of crime 'til I get the chair, Columbine in my trigger hair
Still I rise and I took the stairs
Feel the fire, it's a different glare
All these fights, it was never fair
Bustin' knuckles, still I'm swingin' fierce
Taste the salt inside my drippin' tears
You should know I never had a fear
You should know I never had a shot
Never had a chance, still, I took it here
Manage pride, but I see it clear, strategize, I'm an engineer
Pick a side, gotta keep it there, switchin' up, nigga, lookin' weird

Tappin' in
Say they waitin' for it, tell the streets a nigga back again
Ridin' 'round inside the 'Bach again
Rollin' flame inside the 'Bach again
405, another traffic jam
Improvise another master plan
Sit outside a nigga family pad
Another seven grams inside a sandwich bag
My whole life is like a balance act
People's champ, but could you handle that?
I pull up inside the black on black
And park this big-ass Benz inside the handicap
What I done, they can't imagine that
One-of-one, it's like a magic trick
Matter fact, it's like a lotto pick
That's why I gotta talk a lot of shit10Embed
And I'm actually gonna get right into it
And they really wanna know how
You know, how can I blaze my own path?
Uh, how can I be successful?
Um, how can I follow the path
That someone else has laid for me to be successful?

I'm sittin' on deuces while the blunt burn
Still rapin' rap music 'cause I want more
All Money In, it's just us four
It's just Cobby, it's just Hoggy, it's just Rimpau
It's just Adam, it's just Blacc Sam and Bolt Da Fatts
Where your 600 Benz? Where your Rovers at?
Where your Cuban links? Nigga, where your Rollies at?
Where your big booty bad bitches stay preposterous at?
Where you hustle? Where you run from the police at?
Where you ever represented hope where the hopeless at?
Where you had to take an oath 'fore you sold a sack?
Dealt with all the pressure, played it like you never noticed that
Amongst it all, put yourself on the map
Turned into a booming operation, where your focus at?
Where your 600 Benz? Where your Rovers at?
Where your Cuban link? Nigga, where your Rollie at?

Loaded bases, that's my motivation
A nigga feelin' lucky, we should go to Vegas
2018 mode of transportation
Got me feelin' overanxious like a home invasion
My dough inflated and I'm more creative
Signed a couple big deals, but it's no paradin'
See, it's a couple niggas every generation
That wasn't supposed to make it out, but decode the matrix
And when they get to speak, it's like a coded language
Reminds niggas of they strength and all the stolen greatness
We used to shoot at niggas at the Mobil station
Full circle, mogul motivation
My self-educated shrewd negotiations
Got the sharks that I'm sittin' at this table with afraid to bait me
No tint on my Mercedes, that's for inspiration
Two kilos on my neck like the fuckin' '80s
Westside Slauson Ave, know my demonstration
Born and raised, y'all affiliated
It's really greatness, ridin' 'round like I really made it
Loaded bases, I'm gon' Wille Mays it, yah

Listen to my ambition, 'cause I'm on one
Swingin' for the fences, for the home run
Even further beyond into the universe
But I got to make it to first first
It feels like every second's being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them
You got the ball, I'ma take it home

I dealt with it, I ain't just out here for my health with it
I weighed the risk and the reward and seen the scale tippin'
Let's all get on one accord and take the world, niggas
Take the money, take the power and the girls with us
Can't buy that bullshit that they sell niggas
They breed drug-heads and jail niggas
Look all these ways they derail niggas
That's why respect me to the utmost when you see me's how I feel, nigga
'Cause I ain't fail niggas
I seen it comin', didn't I tell niggas?
Different lane, same passion for them L niggas
Switch lanes, all-black, two glass ceilings
V-12 too fast, nigga, gone

Listen to my ambition, 'cause I'm on one

Tryna walk to school, get your jaw socked
Tryna pump your gas, get your car shot
Large profit margin on the long shots
'Cause young niggas rarely make it off of our block
Night time, locs on
Fuckin' young bitches while they folks home
High school, didn't go
Couldn't understand my plan, now you niggas know
Self-made, well-paid
I'm from where they tell you never touch the shell case
I'm from where they teach you never trust a pale face
Let's talk bangin', I can tell you 'bout a failed race

I switched it up, that's me singin' on the chorus
But still, I spit bars so gutter
Drive cars, no stutter, top floor, no clutter
Hardwood floors, though
White wall, that's where my awards go
Runnin' from the law 'til they foreclose
Sit with myself when them doors close
Sometimes I got a question, only Lord knows

Night time, locs on

Put my right hand to God, shine on these broads
Stay on my job, grind with my squad
Hundred racks on my car, no license at all
No tint on that thing, nigga, 'cause that's how we ball
All these fuck niggas flawed, suckas and frauds
My circle so small, stick to my script and just ball
First, I pick up my bitch, then we shut down the mall
Had to pick up the tip, she tried to pay for it all
Bring some 'yac with my plate, garlic noodles and steak
Bouncin' out the valet with all these tats on my face
People looking like, "Hey, Black nigga, stay in your place"
But it's some shit they gon' think and it's some shit they gon' say
Got to a brick from an eighth, see that music's my fate
Switched it up, from out my trunk, went to the top of my state
And I Versace'd my waist like 2Pac in his hey'
Bryan Williams how I built this All Money estate, woah

I put my right hand to God
I put my right hand to God

Put my right hand to Jesus, fly like a eagle
Fight with these demons, shine light on my people
This life is a free throw, success is a kilo
My wife is a C-note, but my mistress is Creole
I sip on that Clicquot while I'm bangin' that Z-Ro
Ghetto nigga like Cheetos that got more famous than CeeLo
Turn legit from illegal just like Pesci in Casino
Get JS off of P-role, watch him blow up like C4
I rose from a Regal, Auroras and Lincolns
Low-pros on Alpinas to German drop top two-seaters
Was young and prestigious, phone was matchin' my beeper
How the fuck you gon' reach him? He makin' more than his teachers
Movin' forward with speed, all your morals'll leave
Only focus is cheese, now the forest is trees
Got infected with greed, distort what you see
Your worst nightmare to need is justify your means

And if I don't try, then how I'm gon' tell
They say that it's heaven, they say that it's hell
But we stuck here 'til we get there
Try to have more faith and less fear
Try to express it to your peers
I'm talking 'bout dreams
Better to do it and let it be seen, cause then it's so clear
Look at them flock, isn't it weird
Niggas is groupies, borderline queer
Fuck it, that's the nature of success, we all hold it so dear
How could you judge one if you was once one
Nigga that might one day become somebody
Who made good on his word and transcends where he come from
Nevertheless still come 'round, show face to motivate these young ones
Niggas will never give you credit, none
Some questions go unanswered, most of those I give to God
Some niggas can't be reasoned with, those gon' meet the squad
Normal nowadays, my life is anything but besides
It's a cold and lonely road, I knew it when I took the job
Progress on my heart, money on my mind

What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the '80s? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
But you drove to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they quotes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix with my sack for the whole day
Drive-bys, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school, play the O'Jays

Caution to you rap niggas try and diss me
I go hard that's why your bitch wanna flip me
Big guns, nigga, turn rivals into rosaries
Extended clips, I give a fuck who you 'posed to be
Straight off the block I sold dope to buy groceries
Now it's rap money, no advance, it's all royalties
You broke, nigga, you could follow me
It's fuck bitches, get money, keep some hollow heads logically
And I'm from where homicide boost the economy
Pay taxes to these coroners and put in work, it's a policy (Hussle)
It's white chalk on the corners
It's yellow tape on the gates
Choppers up above
That's 'cause the Tiny Locs runs the streets where I'm from

This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns, money and bitches, that's the way that we do it
First get your grind on, then get your shine on
Then come through daytime with the lights on (Hussle, Hussle)
Now hit the fast lane (Yeah) and let your chain swang (Yeah)
You gettin' dollars like a doctor, but you gangbang

I'm a dropout but now I speak at colleges
Ironic, I'm honest
I get paid to speak my mind, and it's crazy to me
Just pay me, fooly; if I wrote a script, it'd be a crazy movie
About my life, about rolling dice
About taking risks, you gotta know the price
Gotta know yourself, on the coldest nights
Can't turn it down, you gotta own the fight
Win, lose, or draw, you could ball
You could've kept it real, but nigga, you's a fraud
Before you get the shit, you gotta lose it all
And then you find yourself and see that you's a God
And that's real shit, thousand hundred dollar bill shit
From hood to the hills shit, like, "How the fuck did we build this?"
Real shit, look

I smoke Kush and sip lean like, fuck a pill
Couple fake release dates, but my bucks is real
My competition never knew what having nothing feels
‚ÄòBout to take hip-hop to trial, like fuck a deal
Rags to riches so my peeps never drag they feet
This all money marathon molds a masterpiece
That ? the button press recline the back seats
And I‚Äôm the realest nigga in it if you ask me
But that‚Äôs promotion, and I prefer publicity
So run and tell your homegirls, and get ‚Äòem all into me
I got a swagger on stage you should really see
Gold stupid dumb chain, Ricky D
You can‚Äôt go against the grain when it‚Äôs meant to be
So hatin‚Äô me‚Äôs an exercise in futility, dummy
Women, power and the money, got it all
See me out and can‚Äôt take nothing from me
I‚Äôma ball, I‚Äôma pop, I‚Äôma raise Emani in the lap of luxury
‚ÄòCause daddy ain‚Äôt no dummy, but
How can I prepare you for a world so ugly?
Gotta lace your baby Vuitton Chuck T‚Äôs
Life is an experience, enjoy that you can‚Äôt
Too much of anything will kill that, you must understand
It ain‚Äôt all about the money, it‚Äôs more about the Fam
And it ain‚Äôt all about yo momma, it‚Äôs more about your dad
That‚Äôs just a joke, now peep how I rise from the gun smoke
Pistol-grip-poetry my nigga get a dose, don‚Äôt stop
Don‚Äôt stop, no tick on my Rolex watch

Young fresh nigga no high school diploma, no college
Still my future lookin‚Äô brighter than the lights on my impala
I‚Äôma dog to these bitches, I don‚Äôt kiss her, I don‚Äôt call her

Off some pop shit, 'cause Rap City in the basement off
This hip hop shit, done slowed down since it taken off
And you can sit and complain, but it won't get you far
And you can pitch a hissy fit, curse and flip 'em off
Because to them, you the only, they depict you all
It's fucked up, nigga

Closest thing I ever had, to a fatherly figure
When my momma shook my pops, said he was a bullshitter
It was just me and my brother, look, my brothers my nigga
So, you know I got your back like your spine
And I'm yet to see another nigga ever match your grind
Nigga, twenty four seven, twilight to sunrise
It was nothin' they could tell us, it was money on our minds
It was triple Cuban links, all at the same time
It was bullet proof windows on them 745s, nigga
You know the games got it's lows and it's highs in it
You know them people keep they nose up my business
Is it a crime for a nigga to see the skies the limit
Reachin' for the stars will have you reachin' through the bars, it's a trap
Never promise what you can't keep
'Cause every day's a constant struggle, struggle (Right)
When faced with reality, reality (It's me)

Yo, show me a stage and I rhyme a page
Rap, sing choruses performin' for the audience (Yeah)
They applauding, and record labels exploitin' (Right)
Tellin' stories of pain and then recordin' them
How they selling our slang and now they talkin' shit?
Wish I could give 'em my shoes and tell them walk in this
Thugs singin' the blues, and now they fortunate
Make 'em mad, flossin' shit they thought we'd never have (Yeah)
Ghetto niggas pullin' up in somethin' elegant
I guess if it's one man's trash, others will treasure it
So that settles it, metals spit, quick to be devil for the benefit, only if I'm gettin' rich
It's like a cycle, these tracks that I'm blessin'
Is mirrors to my pain, so I'm rappin' my reflection
Livin' in the rain, got me blackin' out, I'm stressin'
It's like I'm relivin' my vision, I'm repeatin' my life (Uh-huh)
My words fight back in punch lines disrespectful
But I'd rather have my voice box the instrumental (Okay)
I got a one track mind, puttin' lines together
And get some glow before I go, I can't shine forever, nope

We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T‚Äôs and dot my I‚Äôs or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin‚Äô battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild

How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know

See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck

Take y‚Äôall on a little trip
To my side, Slauson Ave
Top of the mornin‚Äô
Ain‚Äôt nobody out yet
Paint this picture for you

I‚Äôm Slauson Ave. and everything on that street
Used to carve our names into wet concrete
Used to sell dope, and I still smoke weed
Just got a record deal, but I been had cheese
Lookin‚Äô at my pieces, like I been had these
Lookin‚Äô at these streets like there is no peace
Faded off a strain of that strongest leaf, like
If only these damn palm trees could speak
But they can‚Äôt, so they don‚Äôt, I could, so I will
Some people never do it, they just wonder how it feel
In the hour of chaos, come the water by my wheel
Like, it‚Äôs all an illusion and the only thing real
Is me, and we, whatever we believe
And that‚Äôs what we project, so that‚Äôs what we perceive
Embedded in my mind, it‚Äôs the code and the creed
Never went against it as I rose in these streets
We was, two deep in a cuddy on E
And Fats dropped a blunt and burnt a hole in my seat
Used to get butterflies when I roll with the heat
But, not for long, say goodbye to the sweaty palm
Young nigga on a mission, tote heavy arms
Young nigga wanna bang, it‚Äôs a heavy cost
Now what he got up in his brain, that‚Äôs a heavy thought
Turned a nigga out, had us murderin‚Äô for clout, look
And this is it
My reality is creep
Slauson Ave. gangbang shit
Nip Hussle, look, look
And this is it
My reality is creep
Slauson Ave. gangbang shit

Swisher full of dirt weed, spark it up
Lookin for change like a bum with a plastic cup
Like fuck the police, I been harassed enough
Where good men get turned to ash and dust
Where cash is lust, with massive nuts I hold
They bust AK47‚Äôs 'til their guts explode
And they stain the asphalt permanently
Daemons hold a player down when he determined to leave
But my kid‚Äôs graduation, I‚Äôm determined to see
Never knew how right Jeremiah‚Äôs sermon could be
‚ÄòCause God damn America, the system is flawed
So we pump this d, avoid apprehension by law
Lay and brawl, and the black ice invisible

But not ready though, she feeling me 'cause I got plenty though
This how we do it
From around the way, they know my name
They know how I get down and play
Around the hood, I afford dangles all day
And make my cheese check traps in every way
The mind I'm in when I'm coming through spinning
In it to win it, tryna make a million by dinner
Like my nigga the set dribble off the bg
You know the block, Ricky hot, shots pop
Niggas getting off them rocks
I won't say the name but niggas holding down the block
Nigga, my cast, I dropped out of class
Wasn't paying no attention, I wasn't listening
I was thinking of the plots with me and my henchmen
Let's go out on the block and try to get it hot
I really don't, keep it cool, keep it cold
Under rocks 'cause I'm not trying to be trapped
Deep in the country or the peninentery, you telling me
Used to have to work under my hood or under my tongue

Had to open my eyes, see the signs and used 'em
How most of my niggas died or locked down, secluded
When devoted to the block, this is all you‚Äôre used to
Pledge allegiance to the present, fuck the past and future
We was brought up quick, would sit off Slauson and pitch
Start with the sack, we could all get rich
I was involved in shit, I can't hardly spit
I went hard for the chips 'cause the odds against us
Never listened to them old heads
On the block with two 11s 'til 11 at night
When told it's more to life than is evident sight
A dope head's on ten-speed bikes with more feds patrollin'

On the block
That's where the blammers explode
And young niggas turn pro from their amateur roles
On the block
That‚Äôs where the smokers is at
They know the spot for crack, 12 noon to jet black

Crenshaw traps, lowkey homies on crack
We got sacks and MACs
Niggas who don't do daps and roll Fleetwood Cadillacs
And then there's that squad of us, that's hard to touch

Promise you'll leave Earth at the scene where they spot your dome
Fuck with cops, so I vacate in the Bens with a diva that's proper
Fuck colds backseats with a copper, feel me?
I been there, done that in the Franco Harris
Stayin' away from the sheriffs, pushin' the sack
On the block
The baby boy hustled from dusk to dawn
Don't be the one to think I'm wrong

Light that shit, nigga, smoke that
All the chronic in the sky
Feel me, feel me

Stop, look, and listen
Crank your box, turn up your system
Bang it on the block where you pitchin'
My synthesis is reminiscent of what rap missin'
My gold glisten due to the zones I sold in the district
I got bitches, that got niggas, that got digits
When she hit the mall, it's his cash she shoppin' with
She know my size, it's 36 and 10 in kicks
So she spend it, then hit the women's shit and shoplift
It's crazy how many ladies call me "baby"
Monica and Mercedes, Tamika and LaShay
We be up all night, fuckin', she suckin' monkey bites on my swipe
Smokin' blunts like this must be life
But then it's back to the grind and grizzly, ya'm'sayin'
With so much work, I chop rocks iwth guillotines
I want big things but them thoughts is still a dream
So I'm on the block until I get the cheese, 'cause
The paper, the cash, the dollars, the profit I'm after
You savin' a stash, shoebox and what's under your mattress
I stay on the ave, I've been watchin' the murders happen
I hit the alley, get a sack and burn a blunt and pass it
On the block, on the bike, on the handlebars I'm rollin'
Duckin' them choppers that talk and watch when they patrollin'
Chrome super soaker, pockets with rocks bulgin'
Double ups under Folger cans, don't let the man know this
Pull up, what up? What you need? Bounce
Eighths to quarters to halves to the whole ounce
My niggas use methods to stretch it and zone out
And connect with Mexicans sendin' pounds down south

Put heaters in granny's house just to her my love
And yeah, my mama crazy but she pampered the funds
She knew that I wasn't just the average son
I'm Slauson, where if you criss-cross, get jumped
We drive MC's with Hammers that make you run, see
I was raised where all the damage is done
I'll shoot dice late night where niggas won't even come
It's murder, ever since Joe's Juicy Burger
Round here, cowards with Jheri curls get burnt up
Niggas, I'm from the slums
And down here, it's hard to breathe when you got a shell stuck in your lungs
And I do it for fun, the hood need me here
The smokers cheer when I run from the ones, come on

Since a youngster, always loved the hood
Didn't know the history but I knew it was more to it
Croker Sacks with Dickies pants, and hard music
Shorty hop to it, lovin' the movement, she true indeed
She puff weed like me, but she don't MC
High off the doja green, L.A. chosen scene
Back streets like, "Nigga, this is alley music"
Pump sacks how my niggas off in Cali do it
Often badly bruisin' haters 'cause they mad we do it
Get that money then fly just like a pack of poison
Then heatin' on 'em like Vicks
We QB, passin' the spliff, packages sell, tryna grip
From the ceiling to floor, how that dough growing
Mami fine, lovin' the hustle like I love to do it
Can't knock it, we back on the block with K-Swiss and Converse
White Tee and sharp creases what we work forEmbed
Bounce
Yeah, we make your crew run run
Bounce the bassline and bend your backside up
Uh, we make your crew run run
Bounce the bassline and bend your backside up

Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib

Girl, why you think it's a hole in your mouth?
And don't try to flip the question, I don't go down south
But I could, show you the bounce
I could show you how to flip that ounce
Tuck it in your purse and cover your blouse
Set up shop, bring the work up in your house
Really show you what this hustle about
That's if you game for it
You in the club, what you came for?
To meet a baller with a car and get all your drinks paid for?
You and your girlfriend with your French tip
And the MAC lipstick, and the black Baby Phat fit
Knowin' that your ass and tits
Is enough to have most niggas blind about the cash they spent
But not Nipsey, you can't knock Nip's hustle
Convince you I love until I got a limp muscle
I flip ruffles until my chips double

Plus mami in the red's interested
Tongue ring probably mean head's in the question
Back out, open toes, all around sexy
Invite her to the session in the VIP section
Come chill with some real bosses
I'll treat your inner thighs like Florence and Slauson
And stay all off and in between 'em
Cough when you hit the green, huh
Yeah, baby, take a breather (Ahh...)
Then she asked me to dance
With a spectacular, immaculate ass I had to have
The whole, not the half, she touched to the floor then damn

And I'ma act like I don't know you a ho
We could pretend, can't we?
And baby, you my bitch and his lady
I'm the one to chirp when your nigga act shady
When you're feelings is hurt, and you're tryna repay him
Just hit the boy up, I satisfy like crazy

And like a bitch I caught feelings for you
Wanted to marry you, probably have a baby or two
And that‚Äôs my word

Still, I'm 'bout buildin' not tryna' fill up rubbers
When I tell you the real, you just tell me you love me
And that you hate me for the same reason you want me
Say you jealous of the blunts and the block and the bitches

I was preoccupied, you not satisfied
You emotional, I was tryna' stroke a hoe
It was physical, but you don't feel it's thru
Look what I did to you, keep a wet pillow boo
Makin' love to your man, close yo' eyes, think of who
And it's cool, we just leave it like that
Cuz if it's mines and I let it go, it's comin' right back

You remind me of my D, I wanna grind
Tell me hit the spot, it ain't hard to find
And if left up to me, I'll provide
I'll be on your team if you'll be on mine
And with you by my side, we'll touch the sky
'Cause you the only way we could multiply
So don't ever believe if I say goodbye
'Cause if I turn my back, I'ma change my mind
Change my mind

Them hard times, leave them days behind
I'm gettin' big cake, Bill Gates frame of mind
That's why I'm stuck with my bitch, can't change my mind
'Cause she was right there with me through my slangin' and crime
Through the pain and the lies, she made the sacrifice
She ain't the act up type when I ain't actin' right
Just around the way girl, but that's my bitch
Stay down for me, she could have my kids
Half of my bread, have the keys to my crib
I'ma treat you like the woman you is, that's on my mama
Just around the way girl, but how I in love wit'cha?
Guess it's the hoodster and the overall thug in ya
Probably the way you talk back when I'm fuckin' ya
Tell me you believe in my dream while I'm up in ya
And after climax, smoke a dime sack
Then sip Andre Mimosa and get closer

Change my mind

Just livin' life one day at a time
The hustle had you wrapped up before I said one rhyme
The hustle had my state of mind on a constant grind
With no room in my thought process for lies
With no, room in them jeans, I'm thought, "Damn, them thighs"
Just sprinkle a little brown sugar in your devilish smile
I could see you was a rebellious child
So we relate on more levels than the evident, it's deeper than time
Would you let your defense down? She told me, "Seek and I'll find"
Let's get away for the weekend, hit the freeway and fly
Now, I let you cry, dig deep in my mind
My mama seen the route chosen and she said goodbye
I was a boy in man clothing, how could I survive?
I met you, baked a cake, then divided the pie
You're special, even with all the ornaments off you
Going back and forth to court to support you often
That's why, when you was pregnant and you made that choice
I wiped your eye, don't cry, you shouldn't rush the course
Take your time, in life, you'll be up, fa sho
The sunshine comes after the storm (And that's fa sho)
And it's somethin' 'bout you, baby, that, I just can't resist
In deep thought while I'm giving you dick
And then you, in my crib, my emotions provoke
Basically, baby girl, you're dope
You remind me of my D, I wanna grind
Tell me hit the spot, it ain't hard to find
And if left up to me, I'll provide
I'll be on your team if you'll be on mine

We smoke Swisher Sweets, nigga, no Optimos
Rock white Tees, Dickies shorts, and fat gold
Squabble in facts, go back, homie, bust with a Mac
And bloodshed, we accustomed to that
On Korean storefronts, where we hustle them sacks
And tuck packs in a payphone, and purp on a Black
You see the helicopter circle, don't cross the tracks
You drive through and you'll be lucky if you walking back
These niggas wolves, gorillas with views that few choose
You think it's cool, but nigga, you too could get bruised
Or even worse, get put in a hearse, put in the church
Then put in the dirt, and that's just puttin' work in Cali
Home of the killers and thugs
Where COINTEL turned Panthers into Crips and Bloods
They tried to cover up the history of what we was
They killed Pac like Malcolm, now we drunk on they blood

Stuck on the block, I ask God for the option to profit
And what I see, all drama, All-Star Converse
And all these niggas got problems and they sobbed often
All the bitches gotta sit on expensive soft shit
Game tight, fly as they come, and all slick
It ain't shit in the world like a summer in the slums of Los Angeles

Car-Car said she made the beat, huh?
Wake up, wake up, wake
We ain't playin‚Äô with the game

We ain't just no fools with Pro Tools
If you break down the music, you could find the truth
For every line that I write, it's ten dimes of white
For each verse that I spit, it‚Äôs ten purchases
Now, you do the math, tell you "Think again"
I get a Franklin for my statements, guess, I'll thank my pen
It goes deeper, blow reefer for the pain within
Niggas get popped then they stage ascend
Once again, it's me against the system, they hate a nigga with a pistol
But they blind to the fact I keep six to prevent history from repeating on me
Sometime it ain't what it seem to be, so peep the scenery
Dope dealers, cold killers, gorillas
On the corner stuck, wide open off that coke feelin'
I play my position, as a go-getter
Bossed up, hustle, daily quota like four digits

(What's the business?) Bank accounts that's endless

Bustin' at one time, screamin' like I want my

Me and money racking finna hit a lick and take it to the bank
Sick of sittin‚Äô in the spot lane with a  in a hot place
Smokers thirsty finna hit a Thursday, nigga chirp me
You could meet up early on a five block
Front of granny house where they birthed me
Gotta fight for Friday, I seen that life highways
Flip or try me, two choices
One road to travel nigga where you going you could find me
In the front hood of the six-six
Used to pump good, got to G around the corner
Part waiting on this bitch, tell her come through
Enough guns for the whole crew
When I'm done what I'm gon' do?
Power move, get more pounds, send them out of town
Where a nigga finna touchdown to
Smokin' in the front room now
We get a car from a brawl with a getaway car
Said she cool now, never ever wanna hit another lick again
Said she wanna go to school now
Fucked up the whole mood now

Still he ain't got no service

Gotta make a quick phone call home
Let them niggas know the word

Money mob bought a Regal with a quarter P
But he left his phone right up on the scene
Right up on the scene? What you mean he dropped his chirp?
Yeah, now we on the spot with work

Break down your blunts, roll up your kush
Get your mind right
Y'all feel comfortable, early morning, check it out

I'm on the block with these rocks, posted, loc'in'
Low-key, so Johnny think I'm smokin', focused
On nothing more than getting to my quota, hopin'
The block roll before they start patrollin', I'm knowin'
They watchin' us, binoculars and scopin'
Bumpin' up the smokers, tryna ask 'em what I sold 'em
My mind state, money over everything underneath the sun
And death cock the barrel of my gun, it go bang
Don't ask me why I gang-bang, no thang
It's easy, believe me, the coppers, they need me
I pay their salary, they know that
My calories were way too heavy to stop, I'm on the block
I'm choppin' down ounces, halfs, sevens
Boulders, dimes, nicks, whatever
I'm goin', forever, I'm never gon' stop it
The profit, I flip it, the spots, I'm switchin'
The Glocks, I spit at any nigga lookin' like oppo-sition
And any action, it got conse-quences
And death 'round is about as common as sense is
Case it go bang, case it go spray, case it go pow
Case it go after the enemies I wacked out
Case it go before the guy owe you knocked out
Case it go through the plywood holding up your house, it ain't
Man, I'm tryna hold your key to the city
The key to having cake, no break, full grizzly
Silverback gorilla catchin' cocaine frisbees
Cookin' up a cookie on a propane chimney
Nipsey, Hussle in the house, I'm 'bout my paper
If money is a bitch, then I'm a rapist 'cause I take her
It's funny niggas spit about the game like they a player
But they ain't Shaq and Kobe, so they just another Laker
And they don't rap they life, so they just another faker
They frontin' for these hoes, hoes frontin' for the dough
And me, I'm front and center, with this hustlin', I'm a pro
Last name, Hussle, first name, Nipsey (Yee)
See, I'ma stay fresh, y'all can stay bummy
Y'all can chase pussy, but I'ma chase money
You only live once, and niggas die young
You live by the bullet, you gon' die by the gun
Comin' off of Slauson, where niggas hate your guts
See you ridin' high, they wanna set you up
Probably jealous of you, never get enough
Money ain't the root of all evil, nigga, what?
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
I've been on the grind since the age of 14
Started with a quarter, bought my first bucket
Bought my first gun, said, "Fuck it," then I bust it
It ain't the ones I fucked off, it's the ones I fuck with
It ain't the ones I tramp treat, it's the ones I trusted
Jealousy and envy, I see it all around me
Kill because I'm up, if I was broke, they'd probably clown me
But I don't give a fuck about this small talk
Road to the riches, they stuck up in the crosswalk
I blow past 'em, though
And burn rubber off Pirelli low pros
My leather's so soft and I'm ridin' solo
My sunroof cracked and I'm blowin' out smoke
All they said was, "Hussle, don't light up no more"
All I do is hustle, so in light of my goal
I do what the fuck I tell myself to
Do not what the fuck you try to tell me
So, nigga, fuck you, we could squabble, we could shoot
We could play the same game, we could act like it's cool

Nights I left it on my dresser, homies got chipped
To be kill or be killed, and I ain't talkin' poetry (Yeah)
If niggas ain't snitchin', then how the fuck they know it's me?
Catch me breakin' nine zones down, nigga, that's a quarter key
And sellin' work to big homies, my older G's
In a luxury set, my chrome thang's gettin' blunted (Skrrt)

Stash spot, tell the cops, it's a no go
It's Question and Bun B, I'm Nipsey, I know you heard of me
Mad 'cause your baby mama flirt with me
But I don't never show that ho no courtesy
And every time you leave she chirpin' me
Talkin' 'bout how you be givin' her the third degree
How she wanna get gone, sip purp' with me
Smoke purple trees, just swerve with me, 'cause

I'm ridin' slow with the fours pokin' out, mane
I'm ridin' slow and I'm hoggin' up the city lane
I'm ridin' slow and I'm clean in the 'Lac
Ridin' so slow while I'm puffin' on some dro, whoa
I'ma put my hand on the wheel, I'ma put my foot on the gas
I'ma shift my b**** into drive, and man I'm ready to mash
I gots the top dropped down, I got my trunk popped open
Sittin' sideways on stitch and tuck and them f*** boys scopin'
Hopin' they can knock my hustle but they muscle ain't swollen
So they gon' have to try again, tell 'em come back when they holdin'
Golden flex in my paint, and glassy rims on Vogues
Chrome, it lay up on the grille and my neon exposed
I'm a pimp, just try and get chose; for the stable, tryin' to get hoes
With friends, they f*** with foes; you already know how it goes
Those that ain't down with this move, play the sidelines or hit the showers
Just get the h*** up out the way 'cause the rap game is ours
Said we don't roll with no cowards, scaredy cats or the 'fraidys
We just comin' down candy, on them fours and them 80s
We just straight south-sidin', broad day with no hidin'
Let the slab swang wide and
I'ma let 'em know that Bun and Question slow ridin'

I'm ridin' slow with the fours pokin' out, mane
I'm ridin' slow and I'm hoggin' up the city lane
I'm ridin' slow and I'm clean in the 'Lac
Ridin' so slow while I'm puffin' on some dro, whoa
I'm ridin' slow with the fours pokin' out, mane

It's so hard out here
But I'm still breathin'
I said it's hard out here
But, my nigga, I ain't leavin'

Lookit, I show niggas too much love, not enough discipline
Now look at all this backwards shit a nigga in
Homies want my head, they'd rather see me dead
Than papered up on BET, that nigga gettin' bread
What you thought? What you think? What that shit do?
"I heard Nipsey gettin' paper, is that shit true?"
"Yeah, he used to hustle off Slauson"
Type of nigga probably deuce up on a coffin
'Cause homies' families was hurtin'
But what's it worth when these niggas want you curtains?
Yeah, I know, they probably smile up in your face
But I know you niggas phony 'cause there's sweat up in your shake
Nigga, jealousy, how easily niggas forget
Used to walk through the hood, nigga didn't have shit
I just hustled off the corner, and I stacked a couple chips
Then I hit the parking lot, with that brand new whip
How you love that? Ain't you 'posed to smile for me?
Why you hate that? Oh, you playin' high for me
They say cut the grass and the snakes'll show
Is you niggas mad at me or do you hate my dough?

When I was 15, my mama kicked me out and changed the locks
Her husband used to beat on us and talk shit a lot
"You ain't my daddy, nigga, I ain't got to listen to you"
Then my mama switched sides, like, "Nigga, yeah you do"
I used to wanna stay away, used to hate to come home
Outcasted from the family 'cause we wasn't his own
Now that's scandalous ‚Äî how you let him hit me that hard?
And that's scandalous ‚Äî how you let your two kids starve?
No lunch money, was bummy, and treated like a step-child
Let me loose on these streets, the nigga went wild
No direction, false concept of family
Quick to bust the first damn burner that they handed me
Mama, these white folks'll never understand a G
Cryin' to the judge and they still reprimanded me
Used to wonder why you act like you always was mad at me
When 'cuz was the issue, but mama, I forgive you
It's so hard out here
But I'm still breathin'
I said it's hard out here
But, my nigga, I ain't leavin'

Slauson Boy Records
Ha-ha, right
Ayy, ayy, my nigga, look, check this out, homie
Stop blowin' up my motherfuckin' phone 'cause
A nigga ain't gon' get there no quicker, you feel me?

My nigga, I be makin' them swerves
I do my thang, quick to switchin' lanes
These niggas, man, they get on my nerves
Always call me back, say they need a sack
So, nigga, I be makin' them swerves
I do my thang, switchin' lanes
These niggas, man, they get on my nerves
Blowin' up my phone, they need the zones
So, nigga I be makin' them swerves

Look, I stay on the grind
That's why you see me on the BG, I stay on the dime
I stash money out of sight, but it stay on my mind
Sells blowin' up my phone, so I stay on my line
I see these dumb niggas, chasin' sales down the block
Fuckin' young niggas, takin' mark money from the cops
Every day I hit the turf, I'm like, "Just come through"
Servin' quarters to the homies in the luxury coupe
I sip the Veuve Clicquot, and blow the kush through the roof
And play cat and mouse with C.R.A.S.H. cops, you know how we do
Stay off the radar, I dipped on Johnny in the Regal
Cracked a fat bitch, the next day I took her Geo
Green on green tint with Betty Boop in her window
Same block, same cop, they drove right past a nigga
I'm smarter than the average nigga from your set
Nip' Hussle, motherfucker, I got traps to check

Yup, I don't know 'bout y'all niggas but, uh, me, I got a quota every day
I wear the same Dickies short but stay with the fresh J's
Lil' hood rat, bitch, so I stay with the fresh braids
Keep a spot on the block to tuck when the feds raid
My network on the turf, it's like the mob
When I pull up on my block, all my workers on they job
I give 'em their work, they give me my cash (Cool)
They pay for a seven, I throw 'em a half
I'm tryna connects on the herd and spread like a rash
'Cause I heard in D.C., it's 500 a half
That's a thousand a whole, fuck it, I'll be out in the cold
And cook the quarters on a portable stove, my nigga
No, you don't live like this
You ain't never hit a lick and shook town for the flip
You never called UPS to track the package you sent
You never broke the bricks in a Motel 6, my nigga

Why they sold bounce and grind motion pounds on the eastside
Cop before the cal backed and hopped out the G ride
Socked out niggas, you thought was real killers
That Crenshaw summer school, Thunderdome in the village
Back in them days when Rack Capone knocked out Zay
And Nip' Hussle had to pardon his fade
When robbin' niggas was the way that we ate
That check cashing, sock a nigga, ripped his pockets then shake
And wet be my blue cuddie and that chrome .380
Young niggas havin' money, tuckin' thousands daily
Johnny was on us, rough, pulled me over on a dime
A quarter in my ass with a pocket full of cash
I had some Dickies shorts on, cop told me spread my feet
That's when a nigga like me thank God for briefs
Enough of that though, I'm out of here, I had a long day
I'm finna shake, 'cuz and go do what the song say

Yeah, Neighborhood, tiny locs do the most
Nip' Hussle in this motherfucker
Slauson Boy, you niggas already know what it is
Huh? Hood shit
Give y'all a lil' throwback, like this
Look, look

With so much drama in the R.S.C
Most of these niggas in L.A. ain't got the heart to beef, so don't
Come around my around my way
Young niggas in the back shootin' dice or on the roof with 'K's
Now as I, step out my closet, put my keys in my car
Dippin' down the 'Shaw, made a left on Hyde Park
Seen some off-brand niggas lookin' shady
Threw my hood, they start laughin' tryna play me, pssh
6-0 degrees got me rollin' up my sleeves
Reachin' for my Ruger that's behind my AC, fa' sheez
I pull up on 'em slow, and hell nah, I ain't hesitate to squeeze
'Cause I'm a tiny loc line presser
You might mess up, make the wrong turn off Slauson and learn a life lesson
MACs with extended magazine and suppressors
Strapped 'cause the police ain't on the streets to protect us
Trapped in a sting, it's all a scheme to collect us
Lock us up in cages that they know ain't gon' correct us
Y'all done F'd up, you from the West, huh?
You got it on your mind, you should get it off you chest, cuh
Lotta speculation who gon' be the next up
Block money, tell these rappers get they checks up
Before you hit the West, charger sock kicks up
So when you get took for your change you could text us
Between Draws and the homie in the red Chucks
It's safe to say we got this whole shit sewed up
We got this whole shit sewed up
I'm just looking for some more kush to roll up
Always smoking that la-la-la
To keep my brain maintainin' through drama, I'm
Not the one, we jackin' for beats on back streets
With aluminum bats, toe tags, and PD
That's any jurisdiction, in or out the district
7-7 division of crime scene forensic
My .9 blur the vision of material witness
20/20 to blind, now she need prescriptions, look
Cut the lights out and twist up a sack
'Cause the feds tappin' my hood, you get all that?
From the birds to the squad to the cameras in the back
Of the routes by field where I handle the pack
See, a nigga like me just had to attack
In junior high, I ain't had no sack lunch, in fact
I used to flip a quarter, get like me for change
Now I flip quarter kilos of 'caine and cop again

Y'all know my style, from hittin' licks and splittin' 50/50
To all expense paid trips 'cause they request for Nipsey
Let's get this bread, nigga
Been on my grind since '99, and like I said, nigga
A broke nigga might as well just be a dead nigga
And when you starvin', you gon' eat whatever's fed to you
Bite the hand that feeds you, you deserve to eat lead, nigga
You pitchin' crumbs to these pigeons, you a breadwinner
All outta bread, they start peckin' at your head, nigga
The loyalty is gone now, so the game different
It's like we can't really ball 'cause we playin' injured
So many undercover niggas in the mix
On top of that, these cameras on these corners taking pictures

Locked me in them cold chains, all over the cocaine
Cold game, movin' with no brains
Got bags of the propane and I'm right back, doin' my own thing
I speak no names, I run with my own gangs
Stay puffin' the purple rain, some shit ain't gon' never change
Put the blow on the block, niggas lovin' what the weather bring
The palms of my young hands whiter than Kevin Federline's
Hallucinate for a minute, go hard off the amphetamines
I got the prescription you need, call me Mister Medicine
Distribute crack rock, you can call me Mister Medellin

Me and my mama and my granny and my big brother

Them same niggas guaped out count cash with me
Plus them same niggas that hopped out quick to blast with me
And stood by my side when they tried to blast niggas
And never ran, never scared like a man shouldn't
Recollectin‚Äô my reflection on a smoker bike
Late night, nigga dropped death in a smoker pipe
He disappeared like thick fog into the open night
And doubled back with more crack and got some smoker's light
Now double that, that's more black with no hope in life
Can't run from that 'cause that's a fact and you know it's right
I wish my niggas could wake up and focus right
And I don't give a fuck about the type of music Oprah like
I ain‚Äôt no street nigga, I‚Äôm the street, nigga

Try who? Not Hussle, don't fuck with him
Skinny nigga, no muscle, so I buck niggas
Silly nigga, no hustle, no bucks

Picture everything that you haters wanna be

Fourteen-five a bird on some pie shit
Walkin' out the Fox Hills on some fly shit
I'm just living life on some "limit is the sky" shit
I'm on some "Ribbon in the Sky" shit
Classic music, you could view it
Few dispute it, 'cause these niggas know I really do it
I shoot up your spot, make you niggas move units
I grew up to Pac, who was bangin' in his music
People tryna blame that for the gang related shootings
But save that, this is everyday movement
Can't bring tool the school then the students stay truant
Yep, and them streets gotta school you

You made it through the darkest, you're the light
Now the world is yours

So you gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)
You gotta take it (You gotta take it)
If you wanna make it (You wanna make it)

Look
Do I love it do I lust it? Struggle of a hustla
Life of a banger, and death is no stranger
I know 'em like it's kin to me, took a few friends from me
It all make since one day eventually
I guess so
Granny said it happen and it's meant to be, just let go
But I can't, this shit keep itchin' me, like
Them niggas outta line how they came through
Shot him in his face point blank, left his brains blew
Now who gon' go for 'em? Probably be the same crew
When bangin' is your religion, it's like a sin not to
A lotta niggas ain't cut from that same cloth
Them, I give 'em space, gotta play it safe
'Cause hard niggas turn holy when they catch a case
I still bark, real talk, I'll never fake
In Hyde Park late night, still chop a eighth
And grind with the homies
Serve dimes with the homies

From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks (I'll be on the block)
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks (I'll be on the block)
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
(HEY!) 'Cause I do it the Hussle way

I'm in a '85 Regal, no tint, you see clear through
Young nigga, lookin' life in the rear view
Burner on my lap, kush in my ashtray
And that's how I'ma play it 'til my last day
I'm used to gettin' money in the fast lane
And I only fuck with bitches that be nasty
Leather and wood, my money is good
And I'm like a young celebrity in every hood
Gold ropes for the crew, chrome spokes on my coupe, two seater
Then I take off the roof like Katrina
And slide like a Visa up Slauson in a Beamer
Call me what you want just don't call me a dreamer
'Cause mines is reality
Grind, no salary
I came a long way from sellin' grams off Gramercy
Boulders off Brynhurst and sevens off Slauson
Now I got options, now I got it poppin'

From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket

Look
Take away my granny blessings I'd be history
Them bullets cuz shot through my 'Lac wouldn't have missed me
Come to my hood, say my name, I ain't no mystery
I'm probably in the spot, feel the hustla's energy
In the kitchen countin' cash, watchin' cocaine chemistry
Cookin' into crack, I was lookin' into rap
Hard to focus on my dreams when I'm lookin' at the facts
Shootin' down the street, now I'm lookin' at my MAC
And you can tell just lookin' at the facts
It's a coffin or a cell if you young and you black
With your name on it
Still, every car pass, bang on it
If you gon' do it, do it right and put that thang on you
You too deep in it to quit, I know the pain of it
You love the game but knowin' that the game doesn't
Love you back, love the fact this the same struggle
City to city, we products of the same hustle

From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks (I'll be on the block)

That I would be the best rapper, yeah, I knew it then
Used to tell my mama 'bout the houses we'll be movin' in
This fast money took my focus off this music shit
'til Johnny Shipes introduced me to his Jewish friends
Damn, before you ball, gotta grind first
'Cause the Palazzo's a far cry from Brynhurst
Them niggas never really figured that it might work
I had faith, then gave my life, now my life's worth
So much more than money's ever meant
I'm gettin' love in every city you ain't never been
The Sheriff told me roll it up, was focused ever since
Dreams come true, young nigga, I'm the evidence
That's only if you put the effort in
Some of 'em gon' die, others'll get life in the pen

It don't make sense not to

Look, I be hoppin' on stages
Drinkin' champagne with a flock of bad bitches and some niggas I was raised with
How every step the topic of they conversation?
Bunch of miserable ass broke niggas, jealous 'cause we made it
Young, rich, and famous plus I'm handsome and I'm faded
I'm just climbin' up this ladder that my swagger has created it
My intelligence has got them so intimidated
Really thought that I would listen to that bullshit you was sayin'?
Ride solo in my two-door with my top off
If the tag ain't Marathon, that Crenshaw crewneck is a knock-off
When we started, he pinned us
No label ain't gon' stop us
I'm in Rothen off of Slauson
I made all my partners profit, look
I'm tatted from my face to my foot
So my body read like a good book
And honestly, that fire weed keep my mind cooked
Takin' trips type of shit, usually keep a dime hooked
Pussy super good, got that sleepin' side grip
Ass pokin' out them pockets with that she is fly stitch
I'd rather be your nigga, she'd rather be my bitch
But no emotions 'cause we both is busy focused on the grip
Real shit, look
Niggas better understand this
I ain't doin' no favors, I ain't givin' out shit

Toss a nigga some work, that nigga runnin' off
Then leave these niggas to starve, they say you uninvolved
I see why niggas get money now and wander off
Not sayin‚Äô that I condone, I'm sayin' it's fuckin' hard
Young niggas with inhibitions of livin' large
Road to riches in double digits on prison yards
Pit falls, brick walls but still I charge at high speed regardless of what I've seen
Chasin' my dream, money comin‚Äô at odd schemes
Got the streets in my vein, that‚Äôs a poisonous I.V
They speakin' my name, I know they despise me for the status I‚Äôve obtained and the places I fly free
They hesitate and this is what I see
'Cause before this rap shit, they know them triggers I squeezed
So fuck all you niggas that lies lead
'Cause I'm just waitin‚Äô on the day you choose to try me
Until then, drop Benz in the breeze
Out in Vegas in the Phantom like a limo I-Z
At the Palms eatin' steak, no need for for I.D
Double shot of Hennessy
Meet my nigga Rob and he's chillin' with some bitches, early 20s, late teens
Pearly whites, pretty face, fat ass, in bikin
Look
We do it at rehab
My aim is to outweigh the painful days we had
Life after the rubbergloves and ski masks
Niggas kill they partners and bring yams to the repass
But still to this shit I pledge allegiance
You could get the fade, holla at me if you need that
I left the hood and gave a fuck about the feedback
'Cause I was once told you that you dont shit where you sleep at
You dumb nigga, this young nigga's on his way up
The world, chico
It's 'bout time they pay up
No more small potatoes for all them nights that we stayed up
Huggin' them blocks, them bullets bustin', they graze us
Run from them cops, they catch up, cuff us, and cage us

To confident fools, I choose not to say shit
The rocks in my jewels are viewed as my language
I've been the shit, so I don't take it to the brain
When these pretty flight attendants compliment me on my fragrance
Louis on the baggage claim, Pirellis on the pavement
Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier scent
A hundred thousand plus monthly, yeah, I make it
But kept it on some S-dome on top of six braids shit
They see me on TV and swear to God I'm changin'
But ask BET if I was backstage blazin'
This new money got these old niggas hatin'
You better know my aim is amazin'

Look, with street smarts who I dumb paid
Seen the brake lights, I had to swerve off the runway
Uh, I knew that I would make it one day
Know I gotta be a real nigga 'cause I'm unphased

Check out the odds and the obstacles I‚Äôve conquered
Therefore my progress makes me a monster
First one to make a name without the Doctor's co-sign
I'm fine, the streets is my sponsor
And they hold me down quite well
Can't ya tell, pound sign fell
Follow me, holla my name at the show
This is dedicated to the girls front row
When I‚Äôm rocking stages and my pants sag low
I ain't mad, go and grab, and go for what you know
Bright lights, different cities every night
Livin' that type of life all the pretty girls like
Fuck but don't wife 'cause they just not right
The type to sell their soul to stand in the spotlight
Long flights got me thinking 'bout the type
Of thoughts through the heads of my niggas that caught life
We all got balls, they caught strikes
And we don't got swag, we got stripes
I took my turf to new heights

I remember all those hungry nights
I remember when they told me I would never
See my name in those flashing lights
But little did they know
That when you're a star
Means that you're chosen, yeah
Let your light shine bright
Get in a Husslas State of Mind
Be who you are
Don't lose your focus, no
You better get on your grind
Get in a Husslas State of Mind

I left the streets alone
I had to take a chance
I did it for my daughter
I hope my niggas understand
I can't believe I sat in it
No matter of fact, I can
See, first it was my dream
Then it became it my plan
I was always strapped
That's cuz I gangbang
My city teaches people use yo' pistol, not yo' brain
Knee deep in these streets, I'm still tryna' make a change
So everyday Nip Hussle live up to his last name
Slauson Boy gang
Through the joy and the pain
Seen the best and worst days
So we play 'em both the same
Hit a lick don't celebrate
Take a loss and I won't complain
I know that I'm a boss and that's just a part of the game
My new gold chain and 2 kilos of cocaine
Put 'em both on the scale, they gon' come back the same
And in my young life, the only rule that I obey
Is All Money In, No Money Out everyday

But truth of the matter, it's really based on your mind state
If you want it, then grind daily
Get it, then shine crazy
First class, leather seats is how I'm flyin' lately
I'm gettin' June money tryn' make July pay me
Cuz if they violate me, who gon' feed my baby
And I didn't tryna see the institution
So my music is the pudding that the people see the proof in
Started at the bottom
Said I couldn't do it
Now I'm lookin' like a problem
Somebody call Houston
Ask yo' favorite rapper
Bet he'll tell you I'm the future
I'm the streets and in the booth
I turn my life into a movie
And yea I did dirt
But I believe in God
I beat a couple cases
And every single odd
That was stacked up against me

You know where I‚Äôm from, you don‚Äôt ever gotta ask us
Banged out, still, these hoes think I'm handsome
And yes I run my city, run my city single handed
If they‚Äôd made a movie about my life it would be a classic
Drove a bucket and we used to share a mattress
Looking at me now you can see the contrast
When I‚Äôm chilling with a model from Toronto in the Hamptons
So what do you need, cause you can have it
Long as you willing to bleed for what you‚Äôre asking
And when you see it you seize it with a passion
Cause we don‚Äôt believe in second chances
The way you fill up them jeans make me imagine
But I don‚Äôt live in a dream, I make it happen
Don‚Äôt mean to get in between you and your standards
But since every night is a scene, I‚Äôm yellin‚Äô action
I‚Äôve got the meat and the cheese, let‚Äôs make a sandwich
Just grab which ever of your home girls is the baddest
Hopefully she got a swag that could match this
But she could be whatever she want, except average
And dressed in something I can mess with
Spend a lil‚Äô something on you bag is expected
Louis Vuitton and Valentino collections
All you Ugg-boot bitches I don‚Äôt mess with
I‚Äôm international, them niggas are domestic
Fuckin' with a baller and usually bringin' out the best in
And when it‚Äôs over you can count me as your blessing
Cause every single loss in your life is a lesson
I‚Äôm on, and I know I am
And I ain‚Äôt in nobody rush cause I know my plan
Money first, women second, and you hoes is last
Cause I don‚Äôt wanna fuck if I know I can
And yeah, you got a butt, but your soul is whack
You like a coke bottle but the soda‚Äôs flat
Your style like the plastic on the sofa set
And run and tell your homegirls I told ya that
Look, damn, flow kinda tough
And I don‚Äôt hate y‚Äôall I just only love us
The title that I hold is what every one wants
But still I play the game like I never one once
It's eleven, you know, one one
And every generation had to do what I‚Äôve done
To the people I‚Äôm a hero unsung
Good thing I don‚Äôt want fame, I want funds
But if they say my name the bell rung
I‚Äôve been through so much pain, I feel numb
The Marathon, my nigga, I‚Äôm on one
For as long as the Lord pump air through these lungs
And I ain‚Äôt perfect, Lord knows I murked shit
Until the day that he gave me something to work with
Open my eyes, he show me it wasn‚Äôt worth it
Told me if I lowered my pride, I‚Äôd find purpose
And it was hard to see the set was a serpent
Going too fast to turn, inertia
Gotta apply the lesson that you learn
You should come fuck with a star, get off earth dick
Got money, but you still feel worthless
Fuck like a porn star, pussy like a virgin
And in return, he keep you in fly purses
But when he gone you calling my line urgent
Cry me a river, I‚Äôve never be the buyer of them lies you deliver
The real is me is mesmerized into women
Most of the times she never been with this fly of a nigga
And I am the realization, of the dream of this motherfucking nation!
Come on, for pussy and power you be patient
Come up first, that‚Äôs the order of operations
Broke nigga hope you hear what I‚Äôm saying
Either that or you should pop Scarface in
Learn the rules to the game that ya playing
You got a cell waiting on you in the state pen

Nowadays that's my nigga DJ Eric
If it ain't him I see like, "DJ who?"
I got a bitch looking so fast, every time I do it people be mad
They want a replay, fool
I ain't even in the vehicle im still road raging
Hand cannon knocking vehicles off the freeway, too
Yeah, I'm fuckin' with my nigga Nipsey
We fucked up way past a little tipsy
Goddamnit, that's the second goddamn thing that this week I'm waiting on
Triple-A to come and get me
FN on a daily basis unless I'm at war
And if am I'm rolling with the fifty
Ain't talking bout a pistol either, bitch, millimeters, bitch
And if you ain't behind it then you don't wanna see this shit
Put your glasses on
Yeah, officer I had it but I passed it on
I'm in and out the airport, no cash involved
White bitch, big tits, no ass at all, just a bag of raw
I gotta keep it on the low
If a bitch nigga see it he gon' raise up his hands and tell it
But all the real niggas see it, and they ain't seen shit
Bet I can check a hundred thousand by breakfast
It's the same old Thugger, still the same Hustler
Still going up, I ain't never going down
I do this rap shit just to rep for my town
Got a crib out in Cali in the hills blowing pounds
Minding my business, me and my bitches, roll so low whenever I go get it
It be your best friends have you in the pen snitchin'
Put money in his pocket, nigga still turn witness
My circle small, I don't fuck with y'all
You say you won the trial, I heard you told it all
Asking me for work, bitch nigga, hell nah
You 5K1, I done seen your file
You niggas fake, you niggas snakes
When you see my face don't touch your brakes
I ain't tryin' to end up in that place
Get the fuck on, go long, that'a way

If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
If you ain't a real nigga, get the fuck away from me
In other words, go long (Bitch nigga, go long)
'Cause you don't want me to put my
I said you don't want me to put my slap hand on yo' dome
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long
Bitch nigga, go long, get gone
If you ain't a real nigga, go long

Roll the windows up
The block is hot
Blowin' westcoast green while the speakers knock
And we about to cause a scene like fuck the cops
Man we glowin' like the beams on my drop top
Roll the windows up
Let the base hit, crack a bottle of patron let me taste it
Split the swisha up the middle its basic, wild out we gone all get wasted

I used to ride on alpinas, up and down Slauson, 18 with a scheme ta', simply get my cream up
Tryna to get my loot so I can floss on them bitches, black 745, Rick Ross on them bitches
Bulletproof with the chrome exhaust on them bitches, triple gold Cuban links I'm Raekwon on them bitches
Listen, Slauson Ave is what the game missin, niggas bang for a livin' and retire to San Quentin
That's why my only mission was contradict to statistics
Make it out, double back, with a pot that niggas can piss in
Or release the window we can throw it at em
But for now just roll em'up so I can blow the sour

Roll the windows up
The block is hot
Blowin' westcoast green while the speakers knock
And we about to cause a scene like fuck the cops
Man we glowin' like the beams on my drop top
Roll the windows up

Slauson, can't you tell? we don't give a fuck
We gettin money round here, they wanna lock us up
Secret society all we ask is trust
Real niggas and we neva gonna change up
Not for money, na homey cause it is us
Slauson boys don't talk don't speak much
Roll around in something foreign with the windows up

Roll the windows up
The block is hot
Blowin' westcoast green while the speakers knock
And we about to cause a scene like fuck the cops
Man we glowin' like the beams on my drop top
Roll the windows up

‚ÄîBark on these niggas, now they know
Niggas won't respect you 'til you empty out your clip
'Cause actions is everything and words mean shit
Look

I ain't got the patience to talk to these niggas 'cause they slow
Fuck around and bark on these niggas, now they know
Niggas won't respect you 'til you empty out your clip

Niggas won't respect you 'til you empty out your clip
'Cause actions is everything and words mean shit

That's why, that's why, that's why I'm still up in the hood
Burner on my lap, just to get it understood
Multi-million dollar deals, just sittin' on the table
On the dope block posted, .40 Glock by my navel, blah
Get the picture, nigga, I can take your life away
Plus a pimp nigga, I can take your wife away (Yeah)
Babies havin' babies, kids killin', yeah, that's life today
Better get a pistol, fuck praying for a brighter day
Crease up on my jeans, gold chain up on my white tee (Uh-huh)
I shine, that's why them dirty motherfuckers, they don't like me
I promise I, try to do the right thing like Spike Lee (Yeah)
Despite these efforts, niggas still got extras
So I'ma get it crackin', bust off and let y'all have it (Yeah)
I'm comin' from a hood where killin' niggas is a habit (Yeha)
Everybody did it, everybody done it (Uh)
Everybody with it (Uh), so tell me how you want it, blah

Now, I don't ever wanna hear you niggas say you doubtin' shit again

Look, look
Fake niggas, don't show me love
And all you fake bitches, I don't want your hugs
I got this pistol and a gang of hundreds
In this drop, Mercedes-Benz, gettin' dumb blunted
Don't be surprised if you don't get what you never wanted
I'm on my fifth fly whip, while you ain't never stunted
Never going broke, funny 'cause I never budget
Lot of niggas 'round now that I ain't never fucked with
That's why I'm in and out of town, out in other countries
It's like the less I come around, the more I get money
And I been catching wind lately that the feds want me
But I'm gon' keep getting rich, so it's gon' get ugly
Told my mama I'ma gang-bang graduate
Pioneered the transition from this Crippin' wasn't easy, nigga, but I mastered it
That's why I still deliver raps so passionate
Built my own lane, ain't no nigga ever hand me shit
Slauson Avenue, do you understand the averages?
The fact, I'm still standing speaks volumes to my savages
We lust lavishness and aim for extravagance
Even if it's only temporary
'Least we had the shit
I press the gas 'til one-60 on the dash is hit
My bitch lit the blunt and passed the shit
Look, iPhone 4's and life on tour
Get five racks every night, what's the price on yours?
I'm down to splurge on my bitch, 'cause I don't wife no whores
Get the whole fall collection if she like that store
Baby, rhyme crazy, that's just how this life made me
Trust funds for Emani, in case this life take me
I live it to the fullest, never let this life break me
This far it's been a cold demonstration
Number one question now is, "Did the fame the change me?"
Fuckin' right, young nigga, should I be still gang-bangin'?
Wait, hold up, hold that thought, take these shots
And tell my niggas S.I.P. The Marathon don't stop
Before I sell my soul, I give my life
It's been a minute but we gon' get right, watch‚Äî

I'mma draw the line, you niggas pick who you gone ride with
Simple ass niggas happy because they fucked my side bitch
But she just mad at me cause she ain't the one I ride with
Drop down and pick yo heart up off the floor girl
And quit tryna convince me that yo ass is not a ho, girl
Wonder why I'm not picking up my phone well
The last twelve months months I done traveled 'cross the whole world
And niggas hoping I'ma flop but, meanwhile I've been getting paid on every stop
Neighborhood nigga still good on every block
Still bust on any nigga acting like he can't be shot, hol' up
I got an extra clip for the johnny still
Burner on my lap, only difference is the wheels
Murder is a fact when you out here in the field
Cause jealous niggas dealing with emotions only bitches feel
And nine times out of ten they just want a friend
But I've been real before rap so I won't pretend
Tell em to they face all flaws all the flaws that I'm noticing
I've never fucked with your type and I won't begin
And then its "oh we on this high horse"
But bottom line bitch nigga this is my horse
Never kill nothing you just wait on it to die first
But this gone be the season that you vulture niggas fly north
Drop classic after classic
Streets on fire, soft rappers can't match this
I ain't doin features even if they got the cash
Me and Blacc Sam ballin out the shop on slauson ave look
There's way more profit in these clothes
So I give away this music and make double back in shows I
360 myself then I exercise control
IHussle.com my digital Louis store
Tell 'em catch up now or find out later
I'm revenge in the form of success to all haters
Where a benz is a form of respect to spectators
And your friends keep it real for a sec then switch later
In this material world where a thought is contagious
Insecurity is created cause niggas is less famous than
Most the time, they just in it for these hoes

On the road to riches
My car fast, my bitches bad
My locs on, my beat thump, my pistol stashed
It's transition, now it ain't no looking back
My bro home, my daughter straight, now what mo' can a nigga ask?
How it's looking? I'm gone keep getting cash
Cause I'm like that Rolex second hand behind the crystal glass
I keep moving, keep hustling till I see improvement
I know that I can't win them all, but I can't keep losing
What I used to tell myself when life seemed useless
When it felt like if I was to change it'd be for music
When Pac showed us that the pain we felt was not exclusive
Was in the hood, but Shawn Carter showed us no excuses
Now kids tell me I'm the reason that they finished school
And if it wasn't for The Marathon, they wouldn't have made it through it
All on Twitter like, nigga gone and drop your new shit
I'm just taking the time to make the proper use of my influence
A couple hundred thousand cash, a few haters
Lawyer fees for new cases, and a box of blunts later, I give you
The Streets Illustrated, latest issue
The update on my state of mind, the everything I been through
Theme music for young hustlers to get they ends to
To prove to every young nigga banging at what you can do
Theme music for young hustlers to get they ends to
To prove to every young nigga banging of what you can do
My
Beat banging
Gold chain swanging
And all money in, still the song that I'm singing, I'm on
Can't fade him, fate can't change him
Still screaming fuck a bitch, and these bitches can't blame him
It's true
When you in the game, to these hoes can't play him
Respect a nigga pimpin' cause they know
He don't save them, that's right
Can't brake him cause these niggas ain't making
Still try with all they might, but I rebuke you Satan

Couple niggas gettin' money, most is broke outside
Rocks in the house, sellin' dope outside

Matter fact a nigga got the set on my back
Slauson boy, the world ain't ready for that
Nigga, it's cold in my hood, ain't no hope in my hood
Couple homies couldn't cope, smokin' dope in my hood
But I could never ever be from no other hood
And I could never ever leave my folks in the hood

"Bigger Than Life" (Starts at 4:20)

What up?
What it do?
Music Corner
I'd like to welcome everybody out tonight
Welcome all the new marathon members
To the experience of a lifetime
I need your hands up though
Yeah, look

I don't want your love, it‚Äôs not why I make music
I owe myself, I told myself back then that I would do this
And I always look so out of reach, it just seems so confusin'
That I felt my place in life, a young black man, it's seems so useless
But I don‚Äôt want no help, just let me suffer through this
The world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas
This knife that's in my back'll be the the truth that introduced us
And the distance in between us is the proof of my conclusion
So life is what you make it, I hope you make a movement
Hope your opportunity survives the opportunist
Hopin' as you walk across the sand you see my shoe print
And you follow 'til it change your life, it‚Äôs all an evolution
And I hope you find your passion 'cause I found mine in this music
But I hope it‚Äôs not material 'cause that‚Äôs all an illusion
And they all in collusion
This racist institution double standard
Actin' like they not the reason we ruthless
But tonight
Tonight is my night, this is my moment
Feelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it
It's a victory
Let's make history
Don't judge me by my progress
Look

Look at where I started and look at where I‚Äôm standin'
Y‚Äôall can say it's luck but I know that it's plannin'
Shout out to the pain that gave me understandin'
Shout out to my gang, it turned me to a savage
So niggas could say what they want to but I go through what you haven‚Äôt
But it‚Äôs not ego driven, it‚Äôs not me boastin' and braggin'
This road I chose to go down, hard to slow down when in traffic
In order for me to grow, I had to let go of some habits
And it's easy to say I‚Äôm on now 'cause you see it, and it happened
But before it ever did, I had to believe and get it crackin'
So I‚Äôm gon' take you back then, 32 shots and my MAC-10
With a dream minus the means, my early teens was fuckin' tragic
And deep inside my mind is buried crimes you can‚Äôt imagine
That I wrestle with at night, demons that I fight I can‚Äôt get past it
So no matter how straight your cash get, it don‚Äôt matter if you plastic
We was lookin' for the lights and all we stumbled 'cross was flashes
But tonight

Tonight is my night, this is my moment
Feelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it
It's a victory
Let's make history

So if it‚Äôs meant, then it‚Äôs gon' be
People love it 'cause they know that this the real me
The cops hate it, so they hope my homies kill me
But I ain't want the fame, I just wanted y‚Äôall to feel me
It‚Äôs my time so I‚Äôm goin' in
We ball 'til we fall, fuck how the story ends
I see these niggas hatin‚Äô, I know you hoes plottin'
I ain't worried 'bout it 'cause I know God got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Say I know God got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Yeah, I know God got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Yeah, I know God got me
See, I ain't worried 'bout it
'Cause I know God got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)
Got me (Got me)

Once in a lifetime shit, you know?
This song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthafuckin' dream
Fuck what they say, do your shit

Tonight is my night (Marathon, nigga)
This is my moment (This shit ain't gon' stop til' I say it's gon' stop)
(It ain't  gon' stop 'til you say it's gon' stop)
Feelin' bigger than life
(And it ain't gon' be unless you make it)
But I gotta own it
(It's your time, get up off your ass)
A victory (10 toes down you here)
(I swear to God I shed tears in this booth, nigga)
Let's make history

For my niggas that's gone
For my niggas that can't be here with me
For the ones that is
Shout out my beautiful little girl Emani
Shout out my big bro Black Sam
Shout out my nigga Fats
Shout out my bro Adam
Shout out my A and Bs
You know what this is, it's the motherfuckin' marathon
And this shit ain't gon' stop, man
One hundred (One hundred, one hundred, one hundred)2Embed
It's like 2 o'clock in the studio
Backed up on the leaks, man, my shit crasp
But I'm back at you niggas though, you know?
I guess this fifty five thousand
So we gon' do it like this
Uh, Hussle, nigga
One take too
Look, uh

Mac 11 on my dresser drawer
Model bitches like, ‚ÄúNipsey, what‚Äôs the weapon for?"
Niggas tryna take, I give 'em nothin' less than war
So what‚Äôs understood there is no explanation for
Put the box in concrete, then put the safe in floor
Extra thick carpet, that's what we laid it for
Young niggas gettin' money's what I make it for
Play this out your Range Rover and Mercedes door
Uh
I graduated from havin' haters
Now I see it all as fake love, so don‚Äôt congratulate us
And thank god for my imagination
I seen the vision, I‚Äôm in it, and now I‚Äôm after greatness
I know that God got me so I practice patience
Most the time I look inside and find the answers waitin'
Been tryna change my life but it‚Äôs aggravating
Making the same mistakes twice, I'm shackled to Satan
So Let's make a toast to the real niggas
Self-made success, know how it feel, nigga
Uh, now raise your glass to the real women
You know the one who man in jail but she still with him
Out here on her own but she deal with it
So I'm gon' tip my S-dome 'cause I'm feeling ya
I represent that any means necessary
Chopper in the window pane, lifestyle legendary
Been treated a lot of ways, it was never fairly
So we gon' shoot before we march like February
And they don't like when I rap like that
They rather I talk about the crime that's always black on black
And say, "Neighborhood of sixty Crip," in every rap
So they can play my tape in court and try to lock me up for that
But I'm cool
Tell them judges, "Look, I'm never goin' back"
It's a marathon, nigga, run a lap

Listen, look, look, now ask yourself a question is you real or is you fake?
Do you sell a nigga dreams or do you stand on what you say?
When they ask you where you from you bite your lip and hesitate?
Or do you step back and chunk your hood up in they face
Is you bangin' is you poppin' is you turnt up
And dope money keep the kush wrapped and burnt up
Ya hot boy bullets bustin' out your granny's shit
You gang-bangin' even though it got your family sick
Now what your life about does money motivate your actions
Is you stackin' or you lost the self satisfaction
Now ask is that your nigga or a snake in disguise
If that nigga give advice that'll lead to your demise
Just some questions
It's just some thoughts for the mind, it's just some questions

Now ask yourself another question is you happy with your life?
House behind a picket fence couple kids and a wife
Or do you see yourself standin' in a different light
Your ambitions of a hustler got you pumpin' all night
Do you know where your goin' or what you come from
I was a slanger then a banger never a dumb, dumb
So what is you when u shoot without a set aim
A body part takin' orders from the set brain, listen what the set sayin'
I will kill without a cause death before dishonor for your niggas go hard
Now ask is that your nigga or a snake in disguise?
If that nigga give advice that'll lead to your demise

Now my car's fresh off the lot and hoes got low mileage
Flying out, getting paid 10 thousand a show, I'm in
2A with my seat back and my window up
Thinking 'bout the funny niggas that done switched it up
We made some plans, most of 'em stuck
So tell me one good reason I should give a fuck

Look, somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead
Divorced the street, she tried to kill me and my wife to be
Black widow, silk sheets and a satin pillow
This California king loved you like a sack of indo
Empty patron bottles and a pack of Mentos
Master suite 'frigerator full of incidentals
Every day we have a ball like a blond bimbo
Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho
And it can be as simple as it seems
If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see
Know, wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream
You could walk on water just don't look down at your feet
Look
Told this world I was a star I'm gon' need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way
I shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray

Now every second is a classic, when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real it's hard to tolerate the plastic
I ain't no Christian, ain't no Catholic but I believe
God gon' shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that I'm asking
We used to be connected, who detached us?
We used to be respected, now they laughin'
We've turned into possessions with no passion

Death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it
And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life
It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life
Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking
Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice
And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary

How much you gross?
So, it's like, I feel like it's a looming question mark over Hollywood, over the entertainment, music industry
What's the new business model?
And, to me, you know, the people that lead to that answer
That lend they intelligence, they hustle, they effort, they mind-power, you know?
Whatever they can offer to that question, and stick to that and come up with answers to that
I feel like that's one of the most important things going on

It's alright, it's just life if you want one
Learn to hold yourself down with a big gun
All these niggas playin' tough, you gon' chip one
For these dollars, a decade, you a risk one
Fuck it though, 'cause when you flat broke, you ain't nothin', bro
Seen a gang of rich niggas get comfortable
Then lookin' at their watch like, "Where the fuck it go?"
Through my eyes I learned lessons like
Time is of the essence and my grind got obsessive
Then my mind got restless
Put myself in the game but batteries sold separate
Question, since when do real niggas come second?
So I kicked the door down, gettin' more now
Nigga need at least like thirty for the show now
Woah now, realest out of So Cal
Baby wanna fuck I'm like, "Mmm, slow down"
I'm eatin' cheese eggs in my hotel
Hussle sold out, nigga, retail and wholesale
Me ballin' hurt your feelings? Oh well
All money in, I pull coattails, nigga
We ain't gotta worry no more, we'll be just fine
And we ain't finna wait no more, so don't waste my time
Remember when we had no way, no way
But we'll be okay for now
We'll be okay for now
And here on out

Hey Nip
What up?
Let me get a flick wit'chu
Come on, lil' bro
Got your camera?
Yup, here it go right here
Aight bet, here you go, homie
Hey, Nip, let me spit somethin' for you real quick
Oh, you rap, nigga?
Yeah, you know how I get down
Let me hear somethin', bro, go 'head

Look, I was stuck in these streets tryna make it out
I seen most my homies change, man, they fakin' out
And my brother really gone, straight taken out
So a death spares a life and it really play about
Cadi finna make it, oh yeah, niggas, that's without a doubt
Hoe don't interfere 'cause all they wanna do is run they mouth
I been out chear really tryna chase the paper route
Fuck wit' me, I'll knock you out
Talkin' Manny Pacquiao
I really do this music so that I could see my mama smile
I'm tryna go major but I know that it's gon' take a while
I don't even know if I'ma live to even see a child
'Cause niggas in the streets with a gun and they be goin' wild
Cadi super hot, all you other niggas stuck on mild
In this Audi smashin', man, this jug got four-thousand miles
I ain't never stoppin' 'til my money stacked up in a pile
On TV, haters watchin' me, I hope that y'all could see me now
Everyday I wake up, I just thank God for another day
Damn, I really can't believe they killed my fuckin' nigga Tay
I remember goin' to school, chillin' up, smokin' eights
And now my nigga gone and his body gon' be on display
These gangbanger's serious, shit got me curious
Losin' homies to bullshit, this shit got me furious
My brother gone too, he ain't never comin' back
How you think that make me feel, nigga? All I do is rap
Anytime I spend money, all I do is make it back
Anytime I'm in these streets, all I do is watch my back
'Cause niggas'll wet you up, chicks'll set you up
You think your days ones with you but niggas be switchin' up
I seen it all
I seen homies go before my eyes
Some homies'll make it, some don't come out alive
My mom prayin' and she hopin' that her youngest survive
'Cause she know that I'm gettin' high
Bills steady, rollin' pie
Wasn't no father in my life, big brother in the sky
Every night I'm in my room and I sit and ask, "Why?"
Bitches choosin' on a nigga so you know I still reply
And they speakin' on my name so I know I'm that guy
Yeah, that's right, my nigga
How old are you, bro?
Man, I'm sixteen, man
Sixteen? That's right
What they call you, nigga?

If what I believe
Is proved to be wrong
Then I guess I'm a miracle

I was been supposed to change up
I was been supposed to fold all this pressure
I was been supposed to change up
Nigga, what would I look like? I come from the hood
I represent the only way up
Had to hustle, boy, I'm tryna touch a toy
I'm tryna fuck these L.A. streets up
Think it's safe to say that I did it
Look nigga, uh

All black everything and my diamonds all love like Vera Wang
Look, blue rags in the south of France
There's some things in life that won't ever change
Me? I'm a nigga that's supposed to ball
'Cause I'm a street survivor and they mold us wrong
Before rap we was rollin' stones
I drove a Cutlass coupe, would cop a quarter zone
Front of the buildin' on my mobile phone
I'm thinkin' pace myself 'cause you could overdose
Not on the drugs but the life you chose
By hangin' niggas, I don't like the row
No such thing as they might parole
They putting cameras up in microphones
They got me sandwiched in, I want a nicer home
They know I take the risk, I don't know right from wrong
Plus any given day you might be gone
No clich√© where the lines get drawn
Come on the block, it's a riot zone
For the loot niggas stoop into pirate mode
Paint with less strokes and divide you, dawg
Guns get drawn, niggas lives get lost
Never was entitled, had to fight for raw
Necessities in life, you see the reason, right?

Look, you deserve a real nigga with money
There's some things in life that won't ever change
Me? Fell in love with a cuban
A celebrity herself, prolly fuck with her music
She the one that the shoe fit but I can't stop for love
Look how the game has seduced us
Benihana's or the Ruth's Chris
A lot of new responsibilities with all of this influence
Spendin' racks, therapeutic
So I snow flake the face like A.C.s in my new shit
One button, where the roof went?
TMZ takin' shots, say cheese for the news clips
Dope boys and them boosters
Gangbangers and hoopers
My style is inclusive, the streets is abusive
But it's life, my nigga, wanna survive, gotta shoot shit
Hella thick skin, never bruise quick
Yellow wrists and some 7-speed shit
I talk to you on some suck a D shit
All visual, nigga going digital, nigga
Not the smartest nigga but its visceral, nigga
My understandin' on a level kinda different, my nigga
Every time I drop, the city a feel it
Every time you hate, you gotta be kiddin'
Every time I pull up, the foreign is kitted
And I can't even really walk through the Beverly Center
Hudson jeans on, ain't the regular denim
I bought the 600, not the regular Benz
Famous without a deal, that ain't regular nigga
Tired of tellin' you niggas I'm not a regular nigga, no!
I was been supposed to change up

It's our equivalent of the Gold Rush with everybody movin' to California
This technology has empowered everybody

With no regards to how you feel about shit, them German plates on my 6
I sleep light, but I dream big
I tend to talk less 'cause I seen shit
Stick to the script until the scene switch
I wrote this movie, 'get this money' is what the theme is
I'm smoking weed like a weed head
Mimosas by the oceans with the cheese eggs
Flickin ashes out my sunroof, victory 'cause real niggas in the lead here

I dropped seven tapes and it was all the truth
Live my life just like a baller do
Meet a gang of girls and they all be cute
You can fall for me, I can't fall for you
I'm in a CL6, that's the baller coupe
You fuck for cash, you a prostitute
Go to school, then girl, I salute
And make a hunnid mill' what I'm 'bout to do
To knock my hustle ain't possible
Me kill you, that's optional
Slauson Ave., I've made lots of moves
'Cause I'm a African that think like a Jew
I be doing me, watching you
Is my example of what not to do
My shoestrings stay Dodger blue
I had a hoop dream, but then I caught the flu
'Cause the routine is still lots of shootin'
And you know I'm a do what I got to do
Picked up the sack, dropped the school
Went hard to the paint, bought some jewels
Switched up my thinking to the proper view
Hopped in this rap, paid all my dues
I'm something like an Impala, fool
I'm so LA like a barbecue
These niggas talk a lot, but they wallets mute
I shop a lot, you know, cars and shoes
When I hit the block, I still rock my jewels
But I ain't one of these niggas that got a lot to prove, nah
I got a lot to do
I wake up, nigga, to a awesome view

I got this cash
I know a place that we can go and trick off on someone of ten Bulgari Shades

I've been goin' hard so long without takin' no breaks
Feels so right, I booked two flights, we leave tonight, and get away
It's not about no chase, 'cause for your pussy I won't pay
But I'm inspired and refreshed by somethin' beautiful with brains
We both have broken hearts so it's alright to love again
'Cause when you let go of your pride, you'll find a lesson in your pain

Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down
Put your guard down, put your guard down
And that's when the-and that's when the guitar come in

Put your guard down

Classic L.A., nigga, stay out my way, nigga
We ain't the same nigga, simple and plain
From reputation in these streets to where you sit on your plane
What you did for your fame?
How much you paid for your chains?
Tryna kick it with the Crips so he can say that he bang
You know he ain't from the gang, that nigga playin' with flames
Got a hunnid young niggas still dealin' with pain
Put a hole in your brain just for claimin' the fame
Look, We know your type, afraid of a fade
I‚Äôm ashamed when I say it, but, shit, a spade is a spade
And me? My transition got me showered in praise
From the streets to the stage, to changin' the game
International Nip Hussle, the current exchange
Once you travel the world, you ain't returnin' the same
Got a Persian in my place, put a bird in my safe
Conscious of rainy days, so it's only a case

Ruthless, scandalous, crafty niggas hate where I'm from
Only the strongest survive in the hood I'm from

I can feel the excitement like I can sense an indictment
Swear I hope that I'm wrong but just in case I'm on my tip
Forever on some fly shit however illogic
Spend a regular nigga monthly income on my outfit
See I was in front of they house with rocks inside of my mouth
When jealous niggas that hate me had they feet up on the couch
And then we made it out
And now we standin' here
Hope niggas don't think this type of shit going to magically appear
And so I got some news for ya
They say life's a bitch and she'll sang the blues to ya
Pay attention to Hussle I got the rules for ya
Made my way through the maze and I left some clues for ya
Now its up to you are you going
Take heed and get paid
And scream all money in until your dying day
Say fuck the middle man get on your grind and save
Or are you more the type that have your mind enslaved
They tellin' me they believe and I got style for days
And when I drop an album they'll be proud to pay
Still out here on this mission and I'm miles away
Somehow I feel like recently I found my way (yeah)
And ain't no feelings that can rival those
And you can pop a molly you can sniff a pile of coke
You could make a hundred million fuck a thousand hoes
But when its all over all that counts is how the story's told
So write my name down write my aim down
To do this my way and carve my own lane out
Shit changed they say I don't act the same now
But it was either that or blow my fucking brains out
Niggas dissin' me got me tempted to change routes
Pressure building up gotta let this pain out
Gotta think smart gotta map my plays out
Before I kill these niggas broad day and yell my gang out (my gang out)
And I stay in this game and get my change out
Figured how to deal with it and see what fame's 'bout
I got the secret to success do your thang now
Or you can keep watching cable on the same couch
Whatever niggas reap they sowing
Me I'll be out in Vegas smokin'
Stupid view city lights glowing
Wine tasting, filet mignon, and knows who grows it
So many people call only a few chosen
And that's why I go hard cause I do notice
She tells me that I am wrong for not using emotion
Too busy to love a broad and I can't lose focus
But maybe in a different life
Maybe when we make it well meet at the finish line
Maybe this is fate maybe god will send a sign
But more than likely he'll say nigga grind
Yeah, so here I go on my second wind
I'm checking shit off my bucket list and it's getting thin
Run out of shit to buy in places you ain't never been
And what you'll value most is a honest friend
Calls from the bank there's more deposits in
Seven days a week I be at my offices

It‚Äôs been a long time, I shouldn‚Äôt have left you
Without a dope rhyme to step to
When you on your grind it‚Äôs stressful
When it come to mine I‚Äôm special
I got a 7-series beamer and my windows bulletproof
So them shells is bouncing back if you should ever try and shoot
Bentley on my arm, a Mercedes on my neck
Maserati on my charm, hopping off a private jet
I got a car with a driver, yellow bone rider
My city on my back but I wasn‚Äôt raised in Prada
Got a phone full of numbers that I never seem to call
Catch them bitches at the show and they be throwing me their draws
Flow sick, no sanitise
Murdered rap records, no alibies
Live from the front line, battle cries
Fuck talking about a dream, let‚Äôs strategize

Let‚Äôs talk about us, let‚Äôs talk about him, let‚Äôs talk about the losses, let‚Äôs talk about the wins (x2)
Let‚Äôs talk about everythang (x4)
Let‚Äôs talk about us

Big money that‚Äôs the motivation
A lot of flights and hotels, no vacation
I told my teacher I was going places
Can‚Äôt stamp my passport, cos there‚Äôs no more spaces
I gave myself an ultimatum, get rich or get sent to the police station
Every time they came I was so evasive, shit I‚Äôm sorry my success don‚Äôt fit your equation
Streets love me hoes too cos I flow amazing ,up the ladder to success like I know a mason
Look its mind on my money, yeah, the doe is ageing
Im with a model watching kobe front row at Staples
Damn a nigga fly, the logo on my belt match the shades on my eyes
Something like a legend in the city I reside, cos I gave it to 'em straight no lies

Unless you talk money if you call or I won't pick up my phone
Can‚Äôt you tell I‚Äôm in my zone, for my city putting on
I‚Äôm a rider from the set, I know how to dress
Got the choppers on deck still I‚Äôm flyer than the rest
All I drink is champagne, respected by my gang
You know what I mean nigga, you know what I mean
Don‚Äôt get this auto-tune twisted
Cos I still merk me a nigga, straight up
And now I‚Äôm on my way up
Used to shoot pounds out of town, lay ups
She told me she was from Decatur but I met her in Miami
From a man I had to take her like
Talk to me and I talk back
And if you text me ima call back
She say you think that you‚Äôre all that
Yeah I do, I do, I doEmbed
Now if I break your heart, lil' momma, don't make a scene
You really mad at yourself 'cause you couldn't do it to me
Probably call me a failure if I ain't never achieved
I rather you call me cocky for livin' like I believe, that I'm a king
No sympathizin' with the fake or suprises from the snakes
It's flock season and I value my estate
So I bought some barbed wire 'case they tryna climb the gate
Houston Rocket on my waist
Hip-Hop cops on my case, but fuck 'em, more deposits in the bank
God damn a nigga straight, crooked letter on my face
I'm a fly crip but I rep my whole race
Couple of us eatin' good but everybody want a taste
They say, "Get with it or them niggas gon' take"
I say, "If you want fish, let me lead you to the lake"
But niggas lazy and I'm a late night, early mornin' nigga 25/8 Life wasn't easy growin' up, I had to make somethin' out of nothin'
If you struggled you relate
But now I'm straight, everything great
I don't need your help now, nigga, all of y'all late
That's why I made sure all of y'all shake
The way y'all ride dick I think all of y'all gay
Practice all night, ballin' all day
Sleepin' on the flights, when I land I get paid
I ain't got a boss, I am not a slave
Turnin' up my hustle is how I give myself a raise
And it's funny how people let money make 'em change
See you stickin' to the script then start rippin' out the pages of history, it ain't a mystery
If I died yesterday, my life would be a victory
These niggas sound stupid, sayin' they invented me
But arguin' with fools is a waste of energy
I'm a franchise player and a owner of the team
And they only envy me 'cause we on a winnin' spree

Now, this the sound of my ceremony
The sweet smell of success, yes, I wear it on me
The Snoop Dogg lookin' nigga in the mirror told me
"Keep gettin' money, fuck bitches, and beware of homies"

But that's where I'ma leave it
'Cause they call it dry snitchin' if I take it any deeper2Embed
Dickie shorts, Bally belt, boxer briefs
Bitch, of course this marathon is where you ought to be
Shopping sprees spending thousands on designer jeans
Exotic women, Mercedes Benzes with bucket seats
Pretty feet, pretty hair that blow in the breeze
It's pretty rare that she meet a nigga as real as me
Especially when she fishin' in this music industry
But luckily she fucked around and fucked with me
Surround myself with the finer things
I guess I'm Hollywood 'cause I'm enjoyin' what my grindin' bring
I'm All Money In, dot I-N-C
Minus the major record label, time to rise the fee
On every stage I'm givin' everything inside of me
But she gon' give it back after the show in the Le Montrose suite
My-My-My nigga Rimpee's got a thick freak (What's up?)
Down the hall gettin' crackin' over this beat
We smokin' good, y'all smell the weed
We finally made it to the plane then we fell asleep
The mornin' came, the night leaves
A little of a workaholic, shit, I might be
Up at 6 in the morning like I'm Ice T
Spent the grip on the Malcolm X, Spike Lee
Hope them other rappers never think they like me
On any given day 60 thousand on my white tee
Ain't nothin' much but what them dollars bring
Addicted to the rush of money, wires and depositing
So no I can't fall asleep at the driver's seat
That's why y'all wake up to a kush blunt and a Ralo beat
Hard top, push the button, you don't turn the key
Bulletproof 'cause I know niggas wanna murder me
I never heard of you, I know you heard of me
And that's the part that make your head hurt

Yuh, me and my nigga Rimpau was on the way to the studio
And cuz had that, um, that Wiz and Curren$y mixtape in the tape deck, the CD changer
And I heard this beat I'm like, "What the fuck?"
Yahp!
Ya know, only thought it's right for my 58,000th leak
Shit, hear we go
Like this, look

Seven days a week, seven different freaks
But I got tired of fuckin' hoes so I just smoke and count my cheese
Watchin' Godfather, leather couches, flat screens
I say I'm on this marathon, she ask me, ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù
Ain't no puff and pass, please roll your own, I do the same
Girl, get on that Marlon Brando and stop tryna pick my brain
Yo boyfriend is a lame, that's why you're not used to this game
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be first class on a plane
Ixnay my landin' gear 'cause I don't need no runway
My final destination is a cloud, it's a one-way
Fuckin' with them streets, ain't no stranger to this gunplay
But I now I eat these beats and I don't never take a lunch break
Back to back Swisher Sweets, never on no sober shit
Post-traumatic stress, I feel like that's what I'm copin' with
So I smoke the best, impossible not to notice this
30,000 feet up, I cross the Atlantic Ocean with a pack of Swishers rolled
And if my time ain't even over yet
I'm tryna live my life so when it's over I got no regrets
The keys to success, multiply what you approach it with
Got to roll a dice but the first time that you can go legit
Seize the opportunity, believe and take control of it
Then get on your marathon and grind it 'til it's over with

Let's go

Why you niggas outside without no gun, you think this shit is a game?
But, no, no, not at all

Why you niggas act as if your body built to survive the shots?
Knowin' damn well, after I get crackin' you gon' be outlined in chalk
The sun is shining and still it's raining
If you don't wanna get wet, then, boy, stop hanging
My hood is warring, so ain't no warnings
Niggas'll take your life, now your moms is mourning
I done seen it happen when we got crackin'
Six minutes later they got right back at us
Ten minutes later we was right back at them
My burner so hot it put a hole in my mattress
Bullets ain't got no names

Switch cars, double back, one down, double that
Yellow tape the gate where they niggas at
Some niggas need a bullet 'fore they learn they lesson
You still ain't got your gun, you ain't got the message
My enemies they know, they say he got extras
When I come through I only got one question ("Why you niggas keep hangin' out?")

Verse 1:
Chip on my shoulder, for niggas that hated on us
Labels that hesitated when radio wouldn't play us
Rappers dropping they disses now see us start explaining
Bitches I used to date wouldn't shut up and stop complaining
Now they looking salty cause I'm sucka ducking full time
Sipping dolce at the roosevelt, cabana poolside
Hundred thousand ain't enough to buy a new ride
See that's the type of disrespectful deal you sign
What happened nigga? last year you was cracking nigga
This marathon got me lapping all you rapping niggas
Been steady rising since the world got a half a whiff of 'Hussle in the House'
And Felli Fel ran it back on niggas
Streets love me cause they know I got crackin' in 'em
Took a stand, never ran and got gaffled in 'em
Bailed out with block money, kept trappin'
And I took this rap game and put some real nigga passion in it

Criticize me for the jewelery that I rock at my show
But watch the value of the dollar drop and gold explode
I got no time for these "I ain't tryin'a stand in line" homies
Think I owe them the world but never did nothing for me
Talking under they breath till they bitch just making her want me
See me or hit me with some fake shit like hey brody
Got enemies, trying to kill me for the rep
Couple smart niggas, think they playing chess go gonna get
Tony montana at the lot with my bitch
Tell them bulletproof that and bulletproof this
Guns behind the AC, I'm stashbox crazy
You can look at me and tell I was a match box baby
I'm game tight so niggas will never play me
Four words for my haters, look: fuck you pay me

When it come down to it
Still getting more money, more bitches
More love than a nigga screaming fuck me
It's so beautiful, it's disgusting
When you figure it out, niggas wasn't all in
So them niggas is out
Shit hit the fan see what niggas about
I heard misery loves company
It's no lie, you get lonely at the top
It's a chance you can drop, so, they don't try
And I won't judge you, I know why
So don't shoot me down when I fly
On the road to the riches
It's a whole grip of niggas that will wreck they cars it won't rise, fuck it
Call some hoes up and roll this weed up
And turn the lights down and pour this drink up
My last shit sold out I'm bout to re'up
Tat on my neck, face, chest and sleeve
Where the cars are world I like foreign features
I get 10 for shows and 10 for features
I've been in the hood and on them beaches
I've been in the game and on them bleachers
Now I see my lane and the shit I speak on
Where I'm standing, motivate my people
In the ocean, blue range with nico
If I'm drinking champagne, it's probably clicquot
Bossa Nova, we should probably eat bro
Got a couple of zones but we gon probably need more
We gon probably need more
But first, let's eat bro
Order me a steak and rice another early morning, another late night
Doing 7 days a week, can you ever get to sleep?
That's 25/8 life oh, get money
Take flights, go for full throttle, no brake lights
Make all the bad bitches wanna play nice
And all the broke nigga wanna hate life

Neighborhood Slauson Boyz

Mama see me on TV, she's so proud of me
It changed my life
Took me off the block, now my change is right

When, we used to rock Schwinn's
GT's, Diamondbacks, we was like ten
Nighttime, city lights, was so exciting
Seen the world out the window with my mama like ten
Used to be a bucket, now she drives a Benz
Black tint, presidential, with the AMG Kit
Always had a way with women
They say lifes a bitch, so I ain't mad
They just mad cause my lifes the shit
I'm in a Jag' with a bad bitch, nice and thick
Intelligent conversation, not the trifling chick
Type a broad make a boss think he might commit
And she got her own crib, she just like my dick
This rap shit let a crook live life legit
Now what I write, go for triple the price of a brick
First class, overseas, all-expense paid trip

Blue '85 Cutlass, everybody knows Nipsey
Hanging out the window, swanging, rolling up endo
Streets detrimental, we ain't know what we was in for
Shootouts in broad day, it was crazy
77th on Broadway, still we blaze heat
When ducking shots turn to bustin' back and spraying blocks
When selling weed went to copping coke and chopping rocks
We going hard, had to give it all a nigga got
Narrowly escaped back-gates when cops raid the spot
My world spinning too fast, had to make it stop
Take a seat, make a plan, then make it pop
I made a record then he said he could make it drop
And one shot is all a nigga need to take it to the top

I'm rising in this game and it feels great
Still tryna keep it real, niggas still fake
Been off the label all year, nigga still ate
Drop the marathon in December, niggas still late
I'm so impatient, but I still wait
I still show love when I feel hate
On a scale of one to ten, I need a high heel eight
Or better, blowin' this cheddar like I'm Bill Gates
Whatever
I'm in this wind til the movie ends
Smokin' California, eatin Peruvian
Out on Miami beach my niggas a few of 'em
Dressed like Beverley Hills, the bitches we usually with
But wishin on a star nigga took it far
And if I lost it all tomorrow I wouldn't trip at all
They say I'm crazy when I say it

Save 'em from the block and what's in back of them buildings

Those little girls are being murdered
Those niggas are being shot down in broad day light
Now you tell me why the leaders of this struggle
Have never taken it before the United Nations

What its been like six years
You still lookin for Osama?
You gonna send more troops
That's your solution to the problem
With no evidence, yall never found the bomb
But that ain't stop yall from killing Tookie or Sadam
A neccessary evil, ain't that the term you use
Hundred thousand something soldiers went to serve for you
So you bury your people and let them burn for you
Over some oil cause the issue ain't concerning you
Since 9/11 you been talking 'bout the threat we facin'
And how you need a couple billion to protect the nation
But look, come to my hood i'll show you desperation
Kids dead at 13 like Devin Brown, with no explanation
Living in LA every single day
It's a war going on outside, no man is safe from

We'll be active
These niggas too stuck in their ways
I know we long overdue, but is we ready for change?
And stand under one flag like an army brigade
It's time to put the duece duece down and pick up a K
And if we banging on some black shit
Lets ride for the dead homies
Get the burners for Malcom and Natt Turner

All you probably do is squeal
Automatic weapons on my back, unconcealed
And I don't care where your from cause real recognize real
Every step is like chess, the wrong move gets you killed
So we act on how we think and never speak on how we feel
I don't believe 9/11 was Osama
Cause 9/11, Bush made a billion dollars
I heard them say gang violence was a problem
And they think that more prisons is a step to resolve it
But most prisons mean the checks keep revolving
And it don't take a rocket scientist to see the conflict
You can't cover up the pain with fake progress
It's time they pay back a portion of the profit
