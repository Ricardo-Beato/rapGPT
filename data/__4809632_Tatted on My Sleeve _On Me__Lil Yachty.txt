8 ContributorsTatted on My Sleeve (On Me) Lyrics
EarlOnTheBeat
On my muh'fucking gang, nigga
(Cannon)
About everything I do for my goddamn gang, nigga
You gotta know that shit, bitch

Gang, that's forever and it's tatted on my arm (Bih)
That shit tatted on me (Bop), tatted on me (Skrt)
Know I keep that ratchet on me (Bop)
Ratchet on me (Bop, bop-bop-bop)
Movin' like Serena Will' (Huh), them racks is on me (Bih)
She tweakin' she want Molly feels and MAC up on me (Hoo)
And MAC up on me (Bih-bih-bih)
Mac up on me (Bee)

Got a lil house in the wood, I let her sip on the mud (Mud)
Drank out her right on her butt (Drank)
Forty eight, Pushkin’ the freight
This the little engine that could
I got them Nikes, doin’ my dirt
I call that lil baby shug (Skeet)
Hit a boy up, pipe his ass up
We finna bang, on his lil bitch, give me the neck
Deep in her throat, she want the Boat, all in her guts
Fuckin’ up racks, with the gang, ain’t no switchin’
All of these nats, on my gang, bitch we fishin’
Spendin’ these racks, on my chain, they got willin’
All of this ice, in my mouth, need no filings, aye
I drive the coupe, I don’t have no ceilings, aye (Lil Boat)

She just let me fuck, now she askin’ me for money (Bitch)
Dirty ass bitch, I ain’t givin’ you a dollar
Back in them days, I was ridin’ in Impala
Back seat, twerkin’ with yo’ sister, gettin’ collar (Neck)
Big neck, she was givin’ neck and she swallow (Neck)
It’s big Boat, boy shout-out the guys and big Gula (Slatt)
Usually they laugh, then they follow (Okay)
Ya favorite rapper chain, prolly hollow (Okay)
Money over bitches still the motto (Gang, gang)
But my brothers come first on my Vato (Squad)
My bro got that rocket power, just like Auto
It’s that slatt shit, sink him like a pothole

Gang, that's forever and it's tatted on my arm (Bih)
That shit tatted on me (Bop), tatted on me (Skrt)
Know I keep that ratchet on me (Bop)
Ratchet on me (Bop, bop-bop-bop)
Movin' like Serena Will' (Huh), them racks is on me (Bih)
She tweakin' she want Molly feels and MAC up on me (Hoo)
And MAC up on me (Bih-bih-bih)
Mac up on me (Bee)1Embed
