24 ContributorsBig Guwap Lyrics
Fishscale all over my motherfucking apartment
Damn, I got dope all on garment
Cooking dope in Trestletree, move the trap to Sun Valley
Now I’m in Gresham housing, money piling, money piling
I’m so fresh, don’t need a stylist
Buy a rental car and tint the windows
Buy a car, stop the mileage
Stuffing bricks all in a fender
Stuffing P's in the spare tire
Gucci ain’t real, you a damn liar
Say yo nigga a live wire
I'ma short circuit nigga wifi
Serve more chicken than Popeye’s
Strong purp, Popeye
One day I might die, but not soon because I’m strapped fool
I got old schools, I got new schools, I got one rule — don’t cross me
Red bottoms on my feet, courtside next to Spike Lee
Baby, I’m Spike Lee

All the purple, all the white
All this green, taking a flight
Up all night, nigga getting shot
Nigga getting popped, Big Guwap
Drop my top, suicide doors
Pouring up fours, just bought me a Rolls
Money over hoes, recycling your clothes
You niggas going broke, I’m sure of my goals
Wop!

Little Mexico we cook up dope
If a nigga broke, we sell him soap
I can see it in your eyes that you niggas going broke
‘Cause you don’t got no pres no mo’
Yo bitches gone, yo money getting low
He used to buy bricks, now he buyin’ a fo’
Money over bitches, can’t wife no ho
Money over everything, can’t go broke
We blowing gas, smoking on flights
Place your order, I’ll be there over night
I’m talking private planes
Hundred bricks of white
Still a young nigga, I live a mob life
(Let’s go!)

All the purple, all the white
All this green, taking a flight
Up all night, nigga getting shot
Nigga getting popped, Big Guwap
Drop my top, suicide doors
Pouring up fours, just bought me a Rolls
Money over hoes, recycling your clothes
You niggas going broke, I’m sure of my goals
Wop!6Embed
