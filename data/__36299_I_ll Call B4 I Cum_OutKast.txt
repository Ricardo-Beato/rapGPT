42 ContributorsI’ll Call B4 I Cum Lyrics
Nigga, quit being so got damn selfish
Put it in ya pelvis
Let it work, gyrate, motivate

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

Oh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy
Bones in my body let me tell you why
If not so, I'd be too, too bad
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is 'Dré
But you can call me Possum Aloysuis Jenkins
André 3000 for short
And naaw I don't want to see your thongs
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws
And I will pause for your cause

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you
You might also like
I'm a gentleman, I'ma satisfy your soul
And then I'ma get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court
Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it out
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo
Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz? Nigga jump on in, relax with a lady
With a reputation known for sexing niggas 'til they crazy
What you mean, dog? Telling a playa like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking on you for fun
Join the bandwagon, nigga, it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak with somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers, all sports cars
Hitting strip bars with the top down, fuck y'all
Groupie, you need to be glad you even knew me
Do me and tell all my friends you truly blew me, bitch!
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

Nigga, you better dial 404-485, well bump all that
But shit, you'd better call before you get here, and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
With a stethoscope running around in one of those cute, short white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius
Peeped in the window, saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes for Daddy Fat Sax
And it was something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should've called before you came, uh-ye-yeah-uh

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you7Embed
