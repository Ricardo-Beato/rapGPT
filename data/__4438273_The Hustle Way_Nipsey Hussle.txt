8 ContributorsThe Hustle Way Lyrics
Look
Do I love it do I lust it? Struggle of a hustla
Life of a banger, and death is no stranger
I know 'em like it's kin to me, took a few friends from me
It all make since one day eventually
I guess so
Granny said it happen and it's meant to be, just let go
But I can't, this shit keep itchin' me, like
Them niggas outta line how they came through
Shot him in his face point blank, left his brains blew
Now who gon' go for 'em? Probably be the same crew
When bangin' is your religion, it's like a sin not to
A lotta niggas ain't cut from that same cloth
Them, I give 'em space, gotta play it safe
'Cause hard niggas turn holy when they catch a case
I still bark, real talk, I'll never fake
In Hyde Park late night, still chop a eighth
And grind with the homies
Serve dimes with the homies

From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks (I'll be on the block)
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks (I'll be on the block)
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
(HEY!) 'Cause I do it the Hussle way
You might also like
I'm in a '85 Regal, no tint, you see clear through
Young nigga, lookin' life in the rear view
Burner on my lap, kush in my ashtray
And that's how I'ma play it 'til my last day
I'm used to gettin' money in the fast lane
And I only fuck with bitches that be nasty
Leather and wood, my money is good
And I'm like a young celebrity in every hood
Gold ropes for the crew, chrome spokes on my coupe, two seater
Then I take off the roof like Katrina
And slide like a Visa up Slauson in a Beamer
Call me what you want just don't call me a dreamer
'Cause mines is reality
Grind, no salary
I came a long way from sellin' grams off Gramercy
Boulders off Brynhurst and sevens off Slauson
Now I got options, now I got it poppin'

From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks (I'll be on the block)
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks (I'll be on the block)
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
(HEY!) 'Cause I do it the Hussle way
Look
Take away my granny blessings I'd be history
Them bullets cuz shot through my 'Lac wouldn't have missed me
Come to my hood, say my name, I ain't no mystery
I'm probably in the spot, feel the hustla's energy
In the kitchen countin' cash, watchin' cocaine chemistry
Cookin' into crack, I was lookin' into rap
Hard to focus on my dreams when I'm lookin' at the facts
Shootin' down the street, now I'm lookin' at my MAC
And you can tell just lookin' at the facts
It's a coffin or a cell if you young and you black
With your name on it
Still, every car pass, bang on it
If you gon' do it, do it right and put that thang on you
You too deep in it to quit, I know the pain of it
You love the game but knowin' that the game doesn't
Love you back, love the fact this the same struggle
City to city, we products of the same hustle

From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks (I'll be on the block)
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks (I'll be on the block)
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
(HEY!) 'Cause I do it the Hussle wayEmbed
