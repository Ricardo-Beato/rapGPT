43 ContributorsMind Right Lyrics
Ayy, my brother said he can phone off
I'm like, "Nigga which one, nigga? Got 'bout five or six of them bitches bro"
And he can't even hear fool
Know what I'm talking bout

Got my mind right, now I run through the streets
I might take flight, don't care if it's he or she
I might make it, Mayweather, just like TMT, ya digg?
And I got Deaf Greg with me
Got my mind right and go got it
Got my mind right and go got it
Got my mind right and go got it
Got my mind right and went got it
Got my mind right and went got it
Got my mind right, you ain't got it
Got my mind right, you ain't got it
Got my mind right, got it

Got my mind right and I swear I went ran up my money
I swear to God man I ride with that Tommy I roll out the pound, not an onion
I swear to God man my diamonds they come from New York and yo shit looking sunny
You come with them Backwoods that shit better be wrapped up like a muhfucking mummy
My brothers on bitches, my brothers on bitches
We catch em and cut them lil' bitches
I ride with the semi, my money's no midget
Got pints and my muhfuckin' reefer
Got ‘scale on my plane and it came cross that water
I locked up the safe but it's not out of order
Bitches they wan' know what's popping, they know that if I pop it they know that she droppin'
Come off the top just like Eddie Hardy, and they know I bang red like a flower
I'm not a christian, I don't go to church, but my front pockets look like a Bible
Comin' up listenin' to my raps, I knew I needed one shot like a sniper
You might also like
Got my mind right, now I run through the streets
I might take flight, don't care if it's he or she
I might make it, Mayweather, just like TMT, ya digg?
And I got Deaf Greg with me
Got my mind right and go got it
Got my mind right and go got it
Got my mind right and go got it
Got my mind right and went got it
Got my mind right and went got it
Got my mind right, you ain't got it
Got my mind right, you ain't got it
Got my mind right, got it

Go and get it just to say you did it
My brother deaf, but he moving pigeons
Ya dig what I'm saying, yeah freaky dig it
I really wanna meet her no damn ticket
I would love to meet her, I would love to meat her
I would love to feast her, I would love to eat her
I would love to treat her, I would love to trick her
Yeah, all of the above no pistol
This shit is serious, Brian Nichols
She so delirious, now I miss her
I'm slick the bomb like a damn missile
Bubble gum booty delicious
She got her tongue pierced
It's a done mission
I'm on a Dom Pérignon mission
Leave a pussy nigga soul lifted
Geeked out, get my toes pierced
Ri-ribbit like a toad listening
Big nose Pinocchio bitch
IPhone, she cordless
I got big diamonds in my watch
Newer Flava Flav clock
Be the first nigga cop that drop then pull straight up to the block (Skrr skrr)
Got my mind right, now I run through the streets
I might take flight, don't care if it's he or she
I might make it, Mayweather, just like TMT, ya digg?
And I got Deaf Greg with me
Got my mind right and go got it
Got my mind right and go got it
Got my mind right and go got it
Got my mind right and went got it
Got my mind right and went got it
Got my mind right, you ain't got it
Got my mind right, you ain't got it
Got my mind right, got it8Embed
