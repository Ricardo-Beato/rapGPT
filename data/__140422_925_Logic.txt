Now if you feeling how I'm feeling put your hands up high
Buck, buck, buck, buck, booyakasha!
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky
Buck, buck, buck, buck, booyakasha!

Now if you feeling how I'm feeling, put your hands up high
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky
I'll be damned if I ain't living the life I always wanted
Started from the bottom as a youngin gettin' blunted
Now I run it like a marathon, ho, yeah it's on, ho
Hits motherfucker, hits, Barry Bonds, ho
In the studio for twenty-two days
I'm too paid, might fuck around and kick-flip in my new J's
I got a show in Paris then Tokyo so I'm Lu-paid
Fucked a shorty in Paris, I'm getting crème brûlée’d

Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
You might also like
How you feeling, ho? I'm making a killing, ho, really doe
Talking all that shit behind my back just like a silly (ho)
Had a dream: Dr. King, now that money ain't a thing
I've been through a lot of pain, looking like we overcame
Goddamn, life just ain't the same, all y'all know my name
Fuck the fame, Maryland where I came, broke up in the game
And it feel good, good, real good, good
Now we livin' in the hills pissing off the neighborhood
It's just me, Castro and 6ix, going crazy in this bitch
Plus my homie Jon, and the whole RattPack, you know we on
Livin' the life of a don while my homie, Slay, roll up the swisher
I get richer while they hate, watch the money gravitate
Finally eatin', grab a plate, hell yeah, that's sounding great
I've been high, I been low, but there's one thing that I know:
It's been a long time coming, now my whole team got it
And if you hatin', suck a dick and bitch about it

Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seem
When you following your motherfucking dreams, yeah
You know it's funny doe, man, white people be frontin'
And you ever noticed like you'd be the only nigga some place
And you go where white people, they be like:
"You wanna move out of the way fellas? Excuse me, thank you very much - taking up all the fucking area, Jesus Christ!"
I love when white dudes get mad and cuss
'Cause you all are some funny motherfuckers when you cuss!
They be saying shit like "Alright, cut the shit! Fucking jerk off!"

Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seem
When you following your motherfucking dreams, yeah26Embed
