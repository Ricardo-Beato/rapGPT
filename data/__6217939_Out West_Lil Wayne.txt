46 ContributorsOut West Lyrics
No Ceilings 3, that's right
Featuring Young Thug, let's go

(Thu-thu-thu, uh, uh, uh, uh, ayy)
Pull up on your block, old school Chevy four doors (Oh, ayy)
I hit for a brick, went and spent it on Melrose (Ohh, ayy)
I was tryna kill ya, no brainer, scarecrow (Oh, ayy)

I might shoot up the casket
Shoot up the funeral, shoot up the pastor (Buh)
I'm boutta shoot up the set, shoot up the movie
And shoot the actor (Pew)
I'm boutta feel like the cameraman, nigga
'Cause I'm 'bout to shoot with a Canon (Yeah)
I got the Uzi with the banana clip
You get the fruit like you Adam, yeah
I let it ring like Saturn
Yeah, I'm talkin' rat-tat-tatta, yeah
I'm talkin' grrt, rat-tat-tat-tat-tatta
Sound like Spanish, yeah
I do the MC Hammer after they bury thеm
They get the hammеr and nails
Hair trigger, squeeze, blatt
Send 'em to Heaven quick as a bat outta Hell
Yeah, if I had Bazooka, I'd blow this whole shit up
Nina take his soul away 'cause she a soul sister
One over your head, one under your nose, nigga
If you're comin' back to life, then pull up in a Ghost, nigga
Uh, I got the Devil in me (Yeah)
I got the reverend with me (Amen)
I got your halo, I got your wings
I got your feathers with me (Yeah)
Rose petals with me (Yeah)
I got the shovel with me (Yeah)
And you in the desert with me (Huh)
Drugs, I got several in me (Yeah)
Now dig your grave all by yourself (Yeah)
I got heads on top of my shelf (Yeah)
Bitch, I got a graveyard under my belt (Under my belt, bitch)
I want you six feet under that Earth (Bitch)
I put your picture on front of that shirt (Bitch)
I let my bitch sleep in one of them shirts
And she let me piss and cum on that shirt (Bitch)
Chop his head off (Yeah)
Stop by his mom and drop his head off (Yeah, yeah)
I'm with Satan, he got on a shirt that say, "I'm with Adolf" (Yeah, yeah)
I got the Devil ridin' shotgun, Hot Boy and the cold killer
Take a picture, say, "Cheese," decompose, nigga

Wipe his nose (Slatt, wipe his nose)
Ain't no tellin' what I wanna do
Man, only God knows (Woo, hey)
