12 ContributorsWhat Itâ€™s Gonna Be Lyrics
I'm in the zone, they keep on getting offended
But I ain't did nothin wrong, but tighten up on my business
And now I'm making millions, everybodys' social
They really too emotional, I don't have time to hold em'
"I wanna be a billionaire," Me too
So I can count a billion cash in hundreds on Youtube
I get dirty money bitches bitches know it's ciroc on my rider
I'm on stage with Diddy, Nicki, Ricky Rozay and Flo-Rida
I rock Mauris without money, ball like Stoudemire, Amare
Hold the blunt with my left hand to show my Audemars in Paris
Look at all the I've accomplished, I just bought me 3 Ferraris
Spent 5 million in my company if offended you; Not sorry

What it gon' be?
What it ain't gon' be, too many chains on me, too many rings on me
Baby dancing on me, diamonds dancing on me cause my watch and my ring straight dancing on freeze
What it ain't gon' be, dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got some killers with some gats and
What it gon' be?
What it ain't gon' be, dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got your dime on my line asking
What it gon' be?

I'm a mathematician young street magician, and I keep on taking pretty girls to Lenox
New Mercedes with 80 in it, watch me spend all 80 in 80 minutes
Saks & Fifth, young true religion
Bought a car so sharp it make the feds suspicious
They say I'm too flamboyant, I say they're malnutritioned
I'm in a rare edition, I think Le Mans edition
Dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got a dime on my line asking
What it gon' be? What you gon' do Gucci, when you gon' leave?
Still popping bottles pouring liquor on chicks; no need to lie I'm such a freak
No need to hide, you so unique I'mma try to beat ya back down til' you weak
Say you ran out of money then more for me, here's more for you, cause you a whore for me
Don't be a whore for free cause we could ball right now, we
Could do this 2, 3, 4 times a week
From Zone 6 down to Camilton, I pull up in that yellow thing
I put rims on, everything
Hoes think I got them wedding rings

What it gon' be?
What it ain't gon' be, too many chains on me, too many rings on me
Baby dancing on me, diamonds dancing on me cause my watch and my ring straight dancing on freeze
What it ain't gon' be, dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got some killers with some gats and
What it gon' be?
What it ain't gon' be, dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got your dime on my line asking
What it gon' be?

Like I'm in the lead, throwing money high, I don't care where it reach
Spent 2 G's a week on haircuts, like 4, 5, 6, 7 times a week
These girls petrified, almost scared to speak
I'm in a new GT with the Georgia peach
Got a condo right off the Florida beach, It ain't hard to reach, so nice to meet
Every night with me you probably fight with me
Sex fight on me and spend the night with me
No rules, everything alright with me, nice shape baby
Shaped just right for me
Catch ball players in magic city show them boys how good my jumper is
Making all pros look like amateurs
I just showed my ass last night I had a blast
My jewelry was so bright haters put theirs in the trash
Pulled up in something fast just to make them haters mad
Rims with the paper tag, paper bag full of cash
What it gon' be?
What it ain't gon' be, too many chains on me, too many rings on me
Baby dancing on me, diamonds dancing on me cause my watch and my ring straight dancing on freeze
What it ain't gon' be, dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got some killers with some gats and
What it gon' be?
What it ain't gon' be, dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got your dime on my line asking
What it gon' be?3Embed
