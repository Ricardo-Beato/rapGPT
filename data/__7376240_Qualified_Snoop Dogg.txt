Say, player
What's goin' down, bro?
Yeah, man
I juâ€”, I just wanna introduce y'all to this player, man
This-this real famous player, man
I mean, he's slick with it, I mean, he's sick with it (Ooh wee)
Enough said, talk to 'em, man

Took trips OT, had to grave five-fifty
Lil' snow ain't, shh, man, this shit get wicked
Marble in the kitchen (Kitchen) really took missions
Black ceramic dishes, hundred K with my assistant (Sock it to me)
Really took chances, bitch named Nancy (Nancy)
Livin' life fancy
Countin' up a dub, watch my hair, bitch, I'm classy (Classy)
Seven-thousand dollars for this all-black jacket I'm carryin'
Everything I spit, nigga, facts (Facts)
So many whips, bought a spot just for that (Good job)
Took her out to eat then back home
Told the bitch I ain't tryna smash
Livin' life so fast, still maneuverin' through the traffic

I'm qualified, bonafide
All of my transgressions
All of my transgressions (Ooh, oh baby)
I'm qualified and bonafide, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I'm qualified, bonafide
Navigating my directions
Navigating my own direction, yeah (Ooh, oh baby)
Please believe me, uh (Yeah, yeah, oh)

I'm the hoe-knockin', body-rockin', non-stoppin', hip-hoppin'
Motivatin', elevatin', known to keep the party shakin'
Ownin' mine, grit and grind, press the line, front line
Solid as a motherfuckin' rock, never testify
Ask your bitch, she can tell you better than me
When on this pimp shit, ain't nobody better than me (Nope)
I ain't braggin', I'm saggin', taggin' and baggin' up hoes
Button up like Girbauds in my Capezios
Hold that, fold that money and dip, one in the whip
With the gun and the clip, runnin' the shit
I'm the one that put the son in the bitch, 'cause I'm qualified
Bonafide, rip and ridin', all y'all been notified

I'm qualified, bonafide
All of my transgressions
All of my transgressions (Ooh, oh baby)
I'm qualified and bonafide, yeah, uh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I'm qualified, bonafide
Navigating my directions
Navigating my own direction, yeah (Ooh, oh baby)
Please believe me, uh (Yeah, yeah, oh)

Ho, ho
Ain't that Larry June right there? (Ho)
Girl, yes, that's himEmbed
