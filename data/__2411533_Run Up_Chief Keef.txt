14 ContributorsRun Up Lyrics
She don't wanna be saved, Project Pat already told em
He don't wanna be saved
I heard he Captain Save-a-Hoe, I ain't saving these hoes
She don't wanna be saved, Project Pat already told em

I heard he Captain Save-a-Hoe, I ain't saving these hoes
She don't wanna be saved, Project Pat already told em
He don't wanna be saved, so I got a gat very close
Shoot him in the face, shouldn't be looking at me with a mug
Bitch, I got my gat in the club
And I dare any nigga run up
My thot got her gat in the club
And she dare any bitch to run up

Up up in the way
100 shots in this K
Shoot you if you in the way
Hundred bands for the case
Girl you got guap, that's great
Cause yo ass wasn't gonna get saved
What I'ma buy today, I don't know what to do with all this cake
He think off on me gon' take, but this shit is not a race
I bought a 100 pair of Giuseppes and I still ain't worn none to this day
I got a girl wearing this shit with my bank
A billion dollars my ring
I'm king Sosa baby, so how you gon tell me I ain't?
She give me, fuck up in vibration
I'm in through your five with my haitians
Bought gold bottles, but ask me what I'm drinking
I always ride, always leanin'
And she gon' give me top, mamacita
I'ma buy some new brazilians
I already know yo ass a lil eater
But she want me to save her
You might also like
I heard he Captain Save-a-Hoe, I ain't saving these hoes
She don't wanna be saved, Project Pat already told em
He don't wanna be saved, so I got a gat very close
Shoot him in the face, shouldn't be looking at me with a mug
Bitch, I got my gat in the club
And I dare any nigga run up
My thot got her gat in the club
And she dare any bitch to run up1Embed
