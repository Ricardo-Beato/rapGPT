21 ContributorsYou Know Lyrics
Cee-lo, we know
I'm sitting on leather, I'm a winner
If I crap out the strap out
Cause I snap right back to the beginning, nigga

You know I will let it pop
Front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You know, you think you ill, but you not
You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot

I peep what niggas hate through my peripherals
Boy, if I leave this club back to the car I got some shit for you
Wanna party? We can paint the town red
Them bottles ain't shit to me, a nigga got bread
I'm big money, big business, I love it
Put the bad bitches with big asses and the budget
I'm the boss, so you know shit is going how it gotta go
I don't want talk tonight, I might just buy the hoes
My pleasure principle spend no expense
First I'm happy then she happy that she can pay the rent
It's nothing to a nigga when he up
But when they down I bet you he won't give a bitch a buck
Flip and catch an attitude like ''Bitch, what the fuck?"
You want from a nigga, huh? You fucking up a nigga, huh?'
Look, girl, you know you're sitting on a gold mine
Fuck with them other niggas think you so fine
You might also like

My flow hotter than the gun after that clip done
Don't care about the set you claim, motherfuck the gang you bang
I hang around with hustlers and hoodlums
That party get the popping then we beefing and we shooting
Let's party like it's 1999
Flat top Gazelle, the swag going back in time
I got it locked, they can't ignore it
Man, nigga, know some bullshit I'm all for it
Heroin Don seven sixty leaning
Chrome clean, spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick
Them victim niggas thinking ''Damn, why me?''
I'm thinking why these niggas never try me
Maybe they feel the vibe, they know a nigga live
I let it off, inside and outside
The club rocking, it's on tonight
Them bottles popping, we getting right
