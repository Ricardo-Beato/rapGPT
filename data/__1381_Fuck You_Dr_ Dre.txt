105 ContributorsFuck You Lyrics
Hi, baby
I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand
You have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much
I think about you, I feel you in my arms
I miss you, I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much that I'd do anything, I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you
I just wanna fuck bad bitches
For all them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass, bitches
Mad at your boyfriend, ain't 'cha?
You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
And gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em, use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah, the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hittman hit it; damn, bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin' 'bout
Chicken head, chicken fed, with a dick in your mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(AirTouch me) Next time you need a taste
You might also like
I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I come quick, help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don’t have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm going too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep goin’
You tryin' to hide it from your husband, but I know he be knowin'
That your pussy's been tampered with
Did you show him that new trick
Of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick?
You be workin' it like a dancer, bitch; it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my mornin’ diggin' through some records instead
But tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook up somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces
I know your man's lookin’ for ya, he's always tryna run ya
Don't worry 'bout me handcuffin', girl, 'cause I just wanna
Fuck with you on the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So what you gon' do, you freak bitch?
You actin’ like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor, so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' ½ Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Somethin' to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See ya)
24/7, Dre, Snoop and Devin
We servin' these hoes and never lovin' these hoes (Biatch)

I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time29Embed
