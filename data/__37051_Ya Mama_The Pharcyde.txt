54 ContributorsYa Mama Lyrics
Yo, man, you gotta be, you know
You gotta be on the dime, man, what's up with that?
Yo, bro-shot
Yeah, word up, bro-shot
Uh, we need some brothers to be, uh, like, dropping knowledge and writin' good stuff
Ayy, man, why don't you quit talkin' all the stuff and do something about it?
You know what I'm sayin?
Oh, you talkin' 'bout kick some, uh, knowledge
Yeah, well, you do that like right now
And some wisdom for the people, okay
What's up with that?
I got it
(Brothers and sisters)

Your mom is so fat (How fat is she?)
Your mama is so big and fat that she can get busy
With twenty-two burritos, but times are rough
I seen her in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (What?), your mama smokes crack (What?)
She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back
Her knuckles drag down to the ground when she walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk

Naked on a mountaintop, tooting on a flizute
Riding on a horse, drinking whiskey out a bizoot
She got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Your mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
(Your mama got a glass eye with the fish in it)
Your mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
(Your mama, your mama, your mama)
You might also like
Your mama look like she's been in the dryer with some rocks
With the big bust nose sucking dirt out of socks
Held up the ice cream truck with a slingshot
She grabbed a bag of cheese corn and a soda pop
Your mama root and toot and stole my loot and my suit
She may have the muscles, but no, she's not cute
She's not pretty, oh, what a pity, got the glass titty
Filled up with Kool-Aid just for the kiddies

On a cliff butt naked, tootin' on a flute
Riding on a horse, drinking whiskey out a boot
She got the teeth and the wings of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Your mama got the wooden legs with real feet
(Your mama got the wooden legs with real feet)
I said your mama got the wooden legs with real feet
(Your mama, your mama, your mama)

Watch out
I'm thinking about your mother to a funky beat (What?)
I went to your house (What?), and she licked me on the cheek (What?)
I said, "Excuse me, lady
But I remember seeing you at the Palladium way back in September"
'Cause you was beatboxin' for Lou Rawls
In some bright red boxer drawers
You said your moms was pretty and young
But she's old as dirt and got hair on her tongue
Your moms, your moms, she uses Brut
And I saw her riding a horsey, drinking whiskey out a boot
She got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Your mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand
(Your mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand)
I, I, I, I said your mama's got a peg leg with a kickstand
(Your mama, your mama, your mama)

Aw, your mom is so fat (How fat is she?)
We rode up on her back to get some burgers from Wendy's
And her skates went flat, I got stuck in her butt crack
They thought I was lost, but I was caught by the G-strap
Heaven forbid a giant fart would give way
'Cause that would blow me 'round the world in a day
We drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
Because we dressed her up to look just like a Chevrolet

Naked on a mountaintop, tooting on a flizute
Riding on a horse, drinking whiskey out a bizoot
With the wings and the teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Your mama's got an afro with a chinstrap
(Your mama's got an afro with a chinstrap)
I said your mama's got an afro with a chinstrap
(Your mama, your mama, your mama)
Your mama got snakeskin teeth
Your mama wears coat hangers for earrings, dude, she looks like
Your mama was making sex threats to Ricky Bell and shit
Nah, your mama jacked the Kool-Aid man for a sip, nigga
Your mama was walking down on Sunset with a ninety-nine-cent sign on her back, dude
You're a sellout
Your mama's a sellout, nigga, your mama
Nigga, your mama did a pop tune, nigga
Your mama's glasses are so thick she could look into a map and see people wavin' at her
Your mother got an Ouija board on her back
Sidney with EQ and everything she keep sayin'
His mother be hooked, fishin' with a hook and reel at the frozen food section
Tre's mama got Play-Doh teeth
Your mother be eatin' Daytons like Now and Laters and shit
Your mama's an extra on The Simpsons and shit
Your mama's so fat you can't even see her legs
It just look like she's just gliding across the floor8Embed
