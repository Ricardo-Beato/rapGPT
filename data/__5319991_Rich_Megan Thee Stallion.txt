Hey, ayy, ayy
I ain't never need a nigga money ’cause I make it
But if that nigga wanna pay a bill, I'ma take it

I love a lot of zeros, but I don't fuck with no losers (Yeah)
Two type of people in this world and I’m a chooser (Yeah)
I was in the club with my trick eating suya (Hey)
Brought my freaky friend 'cause he know I ain't gon' do nothin' (Nah)
He be eating everybody pussy, I can't kiss him
I'ma give him back when he broke, I can't fix him (Nah)
Should’ve saw his face when I ran it up in Louis (Ha)
I’ma treat the nigga how he look (Ayy, ayy), stupid

I'm a rich bitch with some rich friends (Yeah, yeah, hey)
If he buy it for me, he gotta buy it for them (Buy, buy)
I’m a boss bitch, I don't need help (Yeah, yeah)
I'ma tell him to buy it, but I can get it myself, ah (Ooh, ooh)
Rich lil' bitch, don’t be speaking if you broke (Hey, hey)
Rich ass bitch gettin' money on my own (Money on my own)
Rich lil' bitch, don't be speaking if you broke (Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
I'm a rich ass bitch gettin' money on my own, ah (Ayy, ayy)

I get real money, big rolls, no tummy (Huh)
Buy it off the mannequin, I go real dummy (Yes)
I'm the hot girl, I'm the it bitch (It bitch)
Probably got your favorite nigga on my block list, uh (Ayy, hey, yeah)
Ain't no upgradin' when you goin' after me (Goin' after me)
Your bitch ain't in my bracket, stop comparing her to me ('Paring her to me)
You in love with him, but he buyin' shit for me (Buyin' shit for free)
We be spendin' time, but he know it ain't for free (Yeah)
