5 ContributorsRoommates meet Lyrics
Jumping jehoshaphat and something that goes with that
I'm more funky than a four year old yoga mat
I've got more bounce than a sixty four ounce
Homestyle Tropicana, papa Santa
Father Christmas is just propaganda
Like pro-

Oh hi there, sorry 'bout that I'm just

Wassup

Practicing my free-stees in the mirror
You must be my new roommate, cool
I'm Paul from Saskatchewan
Nice to meet you

Wassup, is this room 3A?

Yeah
You might also like
This is Garfield-
Garfield Dorm?

Garfield dorm, 3A
You got it, man
You're definitely my new roommate
And this is definitely your bed
'Cause it's the one that's not made
Mine is right over here
And I took the corresponding closet

Right, right

So what's your name, money grip?

Umm, my name is Ace
This can't be right

Cool, so Ace where are you from?
I'm from Brooklyn, New York

Brooklyn?!
Holy cow! I have heard so much about Brooklyn
From my favorite rap tunes
What's it really like?
Is it really like, um, dangerous everywhere?
It's nothing like Saskatchewan I've heard

Let's just say it's differentEmbed
