(We did it, we did it, Joe!)
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I'm in the Louis store with a Gucci mask
I'm in the Louis store with a Gucci mask
I'm in the Louis store with a Gucci mask
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed

If we ain't doin' business, it won't be no business
If we ain't doin' business, it won't be no business
If we ain't doin' business, it won't be no business
If we ain't doin' business, it won't be no business
Pick it, Donda son, I'll take it, mmh
Pick another one and let it, mmh
Find another one and let it, mmh
Fine life and I could've—, mmh
I'm not gonna lie, I couldn't move
Couldn't even if I wanted to
Couldn't scare me if it haunted you
I'ma do what I wanna do
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?
Remember I examined, I did too
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?
We stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
You might also like
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?
We stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
What you look like in that nasty Louis bag?
We stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed
(We did it, we did it, Joe!) Ayy

I'm my lil' cousin's favorite cousin
I gave 'em all my number and my phone ain't stopped buzzin'
They listen to my songs and say their parents hate the cussin'
They asked if I was nervous on TV or if I wasn't
They asked me if it's true that I don't go to church
"My daddy said you don't," well, then I guess you know
I been thinkin' about goin', though, I might let you know
One day, I'll bring you to my concert if they let you go
Pumpin' gas alone at Texaco
Hopin' I don't get approached
Don't know if it's clear until I check the coast
All these rappers dyin', I don't wan' be one that's next to go
Paranoia tickin' in my head just like a metronome
I can't walk around like Jack that wore the spectacles
I shook the hands, took the pictures, made myself accessible
Threw the parties, showed love, kept it all respectable
Tried to give you something you ain't had before but
It's all over, they got the drop on my life, it's all over
All this pressure on me, they'd wish I'd fall over
Too bad I'm a winner like fall over
I dropped, uh, heat in February
Cocky tweets in February
All-Star weekend with the court-side seats in February
I'm the champ', you come second like the E in February
All that humble **** was fake, now, can we keep it legendary?
