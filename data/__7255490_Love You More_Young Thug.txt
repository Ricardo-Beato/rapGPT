No, I'm not tryin'
To be the last thing you see when you turn your light off
You're makin' me feel something, but I know that it's wrong
Can't you see it's not who I wanna be? Yeah

'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything
'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything

Hoping you call 'bout anything
I love when you call me about anything
I love how you don't doubt anything
Like I said, get anything
'Cause I love the way you call my phone
And texting me, "Good morning", two shots of Patr√≥n
Now we sexing 'til the morning, hate when you don't cum
You done told a nigga it's corny walking around with an attitude, oh, I'm supposed to be at a party
Girl, you know I love you, ain't disrespect whenever I'm tardy
Walking around with a shopping cart, we tearing down Barneys
Oh, girl, I want you badly

'Cause I love you more than anything (Anything, go 'head, go 'head, go 'head)
Oh, I love you more than anything (Love you more than anything, anything)
'Cause I love you more than anything (Oh yeah, yeah, oh, oh)
Oh, I love you more than anything (More than any, more than anything)

Don't ask about petty things
Don't have to beg, she get anything
I love her bad, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything (Love you more than anything, anything)
'Cause I love you more than anything (Oh yeah, yeah, oh, oh)
Oh, I love you more than anything (More than any, more than anything)

Metro
Oh, yes, I love you, I adore you
Put you up, I want more for you
Grab my heart, so hold you close

And I know it's true

Won't be no love lost 'cause I love you8Embed
