27 ContributorsNo Shame Lyrics
Ain't no shame in my game
I found a new high, yeah

There's no shame in my game
There's no shame in my pain
I found new propane
I found new cocaine (I found)
There's no shame in my game (ain't no)
There's no shame in my pain
I found new propane (I found)
I found new cocaine (I found)

I found Xanax and it's makin' me fall in love (love)
I found codeine and it's flowin' through my blood
Ain't no shame, there ain't no shame (ain't no shame)
Ain't no shame, there ain't no shame (ain't no)
In codeine, pour, baby, baby, ba, ba
10 bracelets on me lookin' like sunblock
White diamonds drippin' on me, neck Lady Gaga
Cut off any typical broads gave me side eye
Perky runnin' out of time (runnin' out of time)
That Perky fill it up one time
Surfing, wavin' 'round the bags
Dirty cup romance
You might also like
There's no shame in my game (ain't no shame)
There's no shame in my pain (in my pain)
I found new propane (I found)
I found new cocaine (I found it)
There's no shame in my game (ain't no shame in my game)
There's no shame in my pain (ain't no shame in my pain)
I found new propane (I found a new propane)
I found new cocaine

Now it's a new high, I found a new high
Now it's a new high, I found a new high
Tomorrow's a new life
Tomorrow's a new life

I had to switch through lanes (skrrt)
I had to switch through lanes
Smoking gas, propane (smoking gas, pro)
I should be ashamed (I should be ashamed)
Made love to her, didn't know her name (make love)
Ain't no shame in my game (ain't no shame)
Twenty pink toes and they're comin' out of lovin'
Cock on your nose, girl, this must be heaven
Treat me like the king, give me head like Mustafa
Paris with the wind, don't you worry, I got wifi
50 naked girls in the room doin' salsa
Ice on your nipple ring shining, Lady Gaga (ice)
Super Bowl ring on my pinky, godfather
Superfly queen on my team, Wakanda
There's no shame in my game (ain't no shame in my game)
There's no shame in my pain (ain't no shame)
I found new propane
I found new cocaine (I found a new high)
There's no shame in my game (ain't no shame in my game)
There's no shame in my pain (ain't no shame in my pain)
I found new propane (I found a new propane)
I found new cocaine

Now it's a new high, I found a new high
Now it's a new high, I found a new high
Tomorrow's a new life
Tomorrow's a new life

Ain't no shame
Ain't no shame
Ain't no shame
Ain't no shame
Ain't no3Embed
