She want to move to California
She must've fucking lost her mind
She want to move to California
That's how they get you every time
She make a movie with her friends
Put it up in a minute
Everybody say it now
Ain't no loop at the minute
Everybody saying
"How, how you do it, you did it?"
I'ma show you what it done
But enough for a finish
Pay attention, you listen
You keep losing your mind
How you want to loop this shit
But looking like a Vine?

But they no pay for no privilege
Now she broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage

In California, oh
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly

All the people all around and the follower people
I go watching a "haha," make a girlfriend giggle
Make her feel so official, make it Serena Vista
Supernova, new residual, making money a little
Make the smoker illegal
Make the living illegal
Make the laughing illegal
Make it snap for a people
When you make a movie now
Know you making no difference
It's a tickle on the mind
'Fore me finish your sentence

So go pimp a like on Vine
But don't pay for the privilege
Now you broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage
Oh, you broke in Koreatown
In that condo you rented
Better get your percentage

In California
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
I want to move to California
I want to hang with DC Fly16Embed
