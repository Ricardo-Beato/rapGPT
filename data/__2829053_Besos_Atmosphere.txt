18 ContributorsBesos Lyrics
One up, never still if the sun up
It's all love until the GOV see you come up
It's like a jungle never know what's gonna run up
We just wanna live forever with the thumbs up
Barcelona, no stops got the bump up
Smart phone in case cops pull the gun up
Artichoke, heart's soft, mock duck tough
Garçon, bring a cup of that young drunk
I ain't ya boy baby, you got me fucked up
Wait, let me state it plainly, shut the fuck up
Trust don't occupy space with dumb luck
Hush, fuzz got the tour bus bugged up
Shhh
Dirty like the wheels on a dump truck
Birds snuck through the security with nun chucks
Adrenaline rush, the whole party jump up
I flood nut on her sponge butt

It goes, people people
I love the way you love the people people
People people
I love the way you love the people people
People people
I love the way you love the people people
People
From everywhere gather around, uh uh
You might also like
Now, too playa, too clean for spoons
Got a, routine 'cause I fiend for structure
But cha, shooting at the ring and the moon
Screaming, fuck the world, 'cause that girl don't love ya
There's a few dreams to choose
But if they let you keep your shoe strings
They don't want you to suffer
And if you're blessed you can haunt each other
In a city of ghosts where the vultures flutter
Now, mood swings a convenient excuse
Seems that there's gotta be something in the butter
Smother the fire before it gets discovered
One foot in the grave, the other foot in the gutter, uh
Boosting any loose thing, if it ain't screwed down
It becomes prey to my hunger
I take it back to my underground bunker
Stay cool everybody, have an awesome summer

It goes, people people
I love the way you love the people people
People people
I love the way you love the people people
People people
I love the way you love the people people
People from everywhere gather around
Uh uh, uh, now
Bonus, me and my cojónes
Hoping that you never treat me like I'm homeless
Unless it mean you about to see me with some donuts
Or dominate the nomination where your zone is
What you thinking, it's the reason we in show biz
Work like a clown with the squirt guns loaded
Only thing worse than being lonely is coke dick
Word got around and now we call you blow fish
You was pissing in your own bowl of porridge
When I rode across the ocean on the back of a tortoise
Never see me try to act like I'm gorgeous
Greasy mufucker make it party with the Socs
Tweet a picture of my penis to the POTUS
Roll my weed in the papers of some old eviction notices
The police came like a swarm of locusts
