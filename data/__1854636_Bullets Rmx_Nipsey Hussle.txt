3 ContributorsBullets Rmx Lyrics
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game
But no, no not at all, I hope out gunnin'
Show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game
But no, no not at all, I hope out gunnin'
Show you niggas I ain't playin'
Cause bullets ain't got no name
Why you niggas act as if ya body built to survive the shots
Goin down nailed after I get crackin' ya gon' be outlined in chalk
The sun is shinin', but still it's rainin
Ya don't wanna get wet then boy stop hangin'
My hood is warrin', so ain't no warnin's
Niggas'll take ya life now ya momz is mournin'
I done seen it happen, and we got crackin
Six minutes they got right back at us
Ten minutes later we was right back at them
My burna so hot I put a hole in my mattress
Cause bullets ain't got no name
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game
But no, no not at all, I hope out gunnin'
Show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
Ayo black war murda, army fatigue socks
Hat seven and a half and a 44 mag, in my dickies
Straight outta bompton. Blood won't stop
See the block's finest, my hood gettin' tossed up
Out that convertible Phantom
Any drama let the Glock start bustin' at random
I stay flamed up
Drivin' somethin red, there go Game, blood
Eight million records and I remain gangsta
Walkin like a pitbull, watchin' my bite
I'm from Compton a.k.a shoot-it-out-on-sight
Cause I was raised by a G, my momma nigga
My heart pumps no kool-aid, so bring the drama nigga
F*ck niggas that's how I feel, straight up
Never run. Unless I'm runnin' red strings through my red Chuck's
Duck! Mothaf*cka it's The Game
Bustin' shots on ya block, and bullet's gots no name
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game
But no, no not at all, I hope out gunnin'
Show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
The sun is shinin', but still it's rainin'
And you ain't gotta ask where he from just spray him
By the look up on his face you can tell we bangin
See the look up on his face when that thing start rangin' (uh oh)
POW!
One down two to go, suspect usual
Murda scene the routine ain't new to you
Switch course double back, one down, double that
Yellow tape the gate, send 'em niggas back
See them niggas with a bullet 'fore they learn they lesson
You still ain't got yo gun you ain't got the message?
My enemies they know they say he got extras
When I come through I only got one question...
(Why niggas keep hangin' out?)
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game
But no, no not at all, I hope out gunnin'
Show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
