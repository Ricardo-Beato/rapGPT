40 Contributors1970 Somethinâ€™ Lyrics
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin' (Oooooh)
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin' (Ooh ooh oooooh)
1970 somthin'

1970 somethin'
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl (Yeah)
Tanqueray or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck (Hey yeah)
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit (Ooh)
New York, New York ready for the likes of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
2:19 is when my mama water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical chord's wrapped around my neck (Ooh)
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy (Ooooh ooh ooh)
The doctor looked and said "He's gonna be a Bad Boy."

I remember back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere yeah

Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse it, I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Stuy (Ooh)
Checkin' his daughter, Tyanna into junior high (Yeah)
If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge (Ohh ohh)
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses (Ooh ooh)
Blazed dutch masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards (Ohh ohh)
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?
I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum (Ooooh ooh ooh)

(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
I remember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team (Yeah-ah)
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream (Ooh oh)
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up (Ohh)
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself (No-oo)
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself (Oooh)
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it (Oh yeah)
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C-74, Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind a great steel gate (Oh no)
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

I remember back in time
(1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere yeah
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Said I knew I
(1970 somethin')
And I knew that I was going somewhere yeah
(Nine- teen 70 somethin')
Ooooh, oooooh
