Logic

I got a date with destiny
My heart says yeah, but can’t convince the rest of me
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me
I need redemption, no need to mention my past
'Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash
The glitz, the glamour, the lights, the camera, the action
The stage, the fans, the speakers blastin'
You know I want it; I need it, don’t doubt it, I can’t live without it
This is everything I dreamed of, it’s everything I’ve ever wanted
But is it really truly in my plans
Or did God mix up my blueprints?
Did He have it right there in his hands?
Anybody give me a hint
I can feel it now; I know it’s coming
And I don’t give a fuck what anybody say
I’ve fallen, I’ve risen, I chose and selected this mission
Incarceration, through these bars created a prison
And I intend to do the time that the sentence is given
25 to life, yeah, that’s how I’m living
Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever make it
But there’s only one way I'ma know
I’m like a seed planted in the dirt
Feels like I’ve been waitin' forever to grow
And maybe today is the day
And maybe tonight is the night
But one thing that I know fo' sho'
This time, I’ma get it right
