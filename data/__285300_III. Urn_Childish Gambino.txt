I watch 'em all pass by the moon and stars
Let me hold him in my arms, forevermore
These cold nights, the park is ours
Standing by the side
Let you go on
To the sea, just for me
Don't ever leave me, my love
Keep holding on, let the modest go
As my mind goes to and fro
Waking up for one more show
We see him in the night
Tell him I'm not afraid of him
I'm not afraid of 'em, 'cause I won't know
