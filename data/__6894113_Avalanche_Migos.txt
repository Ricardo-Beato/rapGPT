Tell that boy go get a new phone (Brrt)
Out in Bel-Air, copped a new home (New home)
Avalanche with the blue stone (Ice)
I am the shit, can't find a fit
My neck is a fridge
The rings and wrists, I retro the kicks
Ain't givin' no kiss, I'm givin' her dick
You starin' too long like you seen a ghost
So whip out your camera, take you a pic'
So when you get home, get back on your phone
Zoom in on the flick and look at the drip
She ask me to pay for the ass to get lift
I told her, "I'm better off gettin' you a Lyft"
Think I'ma put all my trust in a ho with no benefits?
Tell her, "Go jump off a cliff"
I go two-thirty, a cup of that purple
Put ice in my drink just to keep it on chill (Lean)
Fuck all that talk, you ain't been in the field (Nah)
Open my bank account, it give me chills (Chills)
