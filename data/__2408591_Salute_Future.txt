48 ContributorsSalute Lyrics
Yeah
Ayy, ayy
For real, for real
This for my young niggas grindin', went snatched them a Rollie

I call the play like I'm John Madden (Hold up)
I fuck that bitch in the Steve Maddens (I did)
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty (Pitchin')
Mixin' the soda like hair dye (Mixin')
Twist up some dodie, my nigga, let's twist up some dodie (Roll up some dodie)
This for my young niggas grindin', went snatched them a Rollie (Salute)

I see your loyalty payin' off (Salute)
I see your grind been payin' off (Salute)
I see the dope been payin' off (Salute)
I see the plug been payin' off (Yeah)
I went to work, they were layin' off (Yeah)
Lil' shawty be poppin' them Xans off (Woo)
Lil' mama, she do it the best now (Woo)
Suckin' the dick with no hands now (Woo)

My lil' rider ready to whack somethin' (Facts)
I told a young nigga to stand down (Swear)
Pineapple Fanta, Promethazine on me, get loaded (I'ma get loaded)
I told you I'm ready to get it, my nigga, I'm focused (Told you I'm ready)
I got way too much juice, niggas can't hold me (Niggas can't hold me)
Bitches can't hold me, I'm juiced up with shorty
I'm whippin' the Rover, or the new Maserati
Bust a juug in the West End at the parkin' lot (Yeah)
Used to sell my crack at Days Inn, had it crazy hot (Woo)
Styrofoam cups, all I know is I get crazy mail
My partners on dust, they gon' shoot up a whole stadium (Yeah)
I don't trust your baby mama, but we made a crazy film
And I smashed her last night on a lot of pills
You might also like
I call the play like I'm John Madden (Hold up)
I fuck that bitch in the Steve Maddens (I did)
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty (Pitchin')
Mixin' the soda like hair dye (Mixin')
Twist up some dodie, my nigga, let's twist up some dodie (Roll up some dodie)
This for my young niggas grindin', went snatched them a Rollie (Salute)

No mercy, no manners (Manners)
No glory, no story, I'm very important (Important)
Go check the source (The source)
I was whippin' the fork, I could jump in the Porsche (I was, woo)
When I jumped off the porch (When I jumped off the...)
I was sellin' that crack like that shit was a sport (Like a sport)
I was runnin' through bushes, jumpin' over fences
I gotta get 'way from them narcs
Hey, man, I can never get 'way from this art (No)
They treat you like Lord
They treat you like God when you beat the odds
None of my dreams was reality just a few years ago, homie was starvin' (Starvin')
This for my young niggas grindin', went snatched them a Rollie (My young nigga, got you)
I feel the weight on your shoulders (I got you)
I need to blaze up the doja (Doja)
You need to blaze up the doja (Doja)
I gotta keep my composure ('Posure)
I gotta keep on goin' (Goin')
Come and lay with you early in the mornin' (Mornin')
And when the sun rise, I know it's killin' you (It's killin' you)
I ain't down with you no more (No)
You done caught feelings, you can't take it no more (Oh)
Me comin' through, smashin', (Smash) leavin' right back out the door (Yeah)
I can tell it's somebody else you're spendin' your time with
I'm just tryna find me somebody else I can grind with
You want me actin' like a nigga on some nine-to-five shit
Ain't tryna treat you like no side bitch, but you my bitch (Yeah)
Diamonds on your ankle, baby, walk light
I been in the kitchen cookin' all night
I see your loyalty payin' off (Salute)
I see your grind been payin' off (Salute)
I see the dope been payin' off (Salute)
I see the plug been payin' off (Yeah)
I went to work, they were layin' off (Yeah)
Lil' shawty be poppin' them Xans off (Woo)
Lil' mama, she do it the best now (Woo)
Suckin' the dick with no hands now (Woo)

Salute
Salute

Yeah
Yeah
