11 ContributorsSuffocate Lyrics
Realest in the city so we guaranteed
Lot of tattoos on both sleeves
I done bought cars that you can't lease
It's raining on you hard and you can't breathe
We rocking up the chicken, that's a dinner date
We testin' and remixin' cooking up the cake
Five bitches in the room I told them, 'demonstrate'
You ain't fucking with my campaign suffocate
I'm a rockstar like tommy lee, and I got them bands like I play the 

I'm a rockstar like tommy lee
And I got them bands like I play the drum
I got a 100 thousand cash on me
And I got a lot of tattoos on my arm
I'm a rockstar like tommy lee
And I got them bands like I play the drum
I got a 100 thousand cash on me
And I got a lot of tattoos on my arm
I'm in the dope game like an athlete
And I can't go to sleep nigga Vietnam
I'm martin diving in the water on the dc
I fell in love with some diamonds and they got me sprung
Aquafina water nigga Fiji
Baking soda, fork in the pyrex
Aquafina water nigga Fiji
Baking soda, fork in the pyrex
Space age pimpin MJG
Remix stack up, compress, future
