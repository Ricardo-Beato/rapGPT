3 ContributorsHidden Darts Lyrics
One-two, one-two, yo
What the fuck is the deal, it's Toney Starks, nigga
Ya niggas know what time it is, the kid with the lazer beam vocals
You know you messing with a dart master, right now
J-Love, hit them niggas

Yo, who want to battle the Don?
I'm James Bond, in the Octagon, with two razors
Bet ya'll didn't know I had a fake arm, I lost it
Wild in war, before rap, I was gettin' it on
Choke a fat nigga out in like forty seconds, my gun get hard
With a .45 steel erection
Eagle on, Kangol hat slanted, coconut, bounce to Morocco
Guerilla medallions, like Flava Flav clock, yo
Niggas want me dead, but they scared to step to me
Rip they guts out, like a hysterectomy
When beef collide, look on the flip, buy a penitentiary kite
Or get you bumped off from the inside
Jaws is hanging, frauds is lifting
They drawers on the floor complaining
Bird ass nigga, resemble, Keenen Ivory Wayans
Stay in your place, dirt bomb rappers get shadowboxed
For training, ya'll still eating bacon...

Yo, I've done walked on fire (fire), never got burnt (burnt)
Slept on glass (glass), never got cut (cut)
And broke a few nose bones, yo, light off a round or two
At certain dudes where they dropped they phones
Yo this straight crack (yeah), even my hand got tooken to jail
For writing murder, my wrist couldn't take it in bail
Then left my fingers for dead, told 'em
"I ain't have nothing to do with the writing"
I hold you down when you be squeezing that lead
Shopping sprees, with my mans on the corner watch D's
Rolling in threes, in them purple capri's'
A gritty bop, my rocks is bigger, wallo's with the gold tassels
Your old slave, with Starkey Love on the shackle
And I stay fly underwater, my toes is iced out
Poofed the nails off, ya faggots can figure the price out
It's chump change, ya'll bitch niggas go get my coco
Get my slippers, before I go gun ho!

Ya'll niggas hold your fucking necks
Before you put them shits to sleep
You know what I mean, daddy
It's real like that, coming at all ya'll niggas this year
I gots to come for that title, baby, I don't give a fuck who holding it
Youknowhatimean? Tone on the come up
Youknowhatimean, I'm playing on ya'll niggas, man
So yo, ya'll niggas know what the fuck time it is and shit
Slow the fuck down, nigga, throw this shit in, it's real...
