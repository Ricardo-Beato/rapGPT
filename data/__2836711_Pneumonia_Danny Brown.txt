Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia
I'm on ya
Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia
I'm on ya

Old nigga came in this bitch with a new gun
Clip looking like a fucking mile long
If that shit hits you close range, ya calzone
Powder stains on my Balmain
Slurp that pussy up just like lo mein
If that coke burn my nose, I'ma complain

Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia
I'm on ya
Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia
I'm on ya

I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope
Got a half a pound of artichoke
Scale broke, so we eyeball it
Her titties out just like New Orleans
Mardi gras, we party hard, she off the soft
My dick head, she celebrate like the world end
And she could be my girlfriend
Only fuck her on the weekend
Momma found some racks in some dirty jeans
Told her keep the money, take 'em to the cleaners
Threesome watched how this dick came between them
Licked the clit and she did the Macarena
Crib in the forest, deer in my yard
'07, I got locked up on a charge
Now a nigga got four bank cards
Looking like a nigga gotta thank God
Going through a bag like I'm snatching purses
Half a key of raw inside my fucking verses
Like a surgeon with that scalpel, bring that track to life
Bounce that ass for that pussy, got a appetite
Geeked up, geeked up, pop a pill just like Mike and Ikes
Head sent me straight to the moon with a mac tonight
Running low on alcohol, nigga gotta make a call
Stay afloat, try not to choke
Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia
I'm on ya
Made 30 bands in 30 minutes
Before I count it, I done damn near spent it
Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens
Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia
I'm on ya

I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope
Got a half a pound of artichoke
Scale broke, so we eyeball it
Her titties out just like New Orleans29Embed
