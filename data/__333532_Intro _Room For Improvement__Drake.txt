18 ContributorsIntro (Room For Improvement) Lyrics
Yo, what's going on? This is Drake
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness
This right here is a Drake and DJ Smallz collaboration
So I'm from Canada, my man's from down South
Ya understand, the number one DJ in the South to be exact
You heard that in the VMAs, you heard that wherever he goes
My man Smalls is out there, down south
Same time, reppin' for Toronto, Canada
Ya know what I mean?
So this right here, listening to right now is the official Southern Smoke Special Edition
I call it the "Room For Improvement" mixtape, cause I'm not perfect
And I bet neither are you if you listening
So you need to just accept what's there, know what I mean?
But look, you need to just let this play out
From track one, to track whatever, however-many-I-put-on-here
You need to just listen to this cause look man, this is the first time
Canadian, down south, my man, Smallz, your boy, Drake
You know what it is man, so just tune in niggaYou might also like2Embed
