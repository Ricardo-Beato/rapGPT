4 Contributors2morrow Night Lyrics
Riding with the riders, with the mileage on the pilot
Couple bottles and some models and some condoms we be wildin'
Choppers in the closet, for the watchers who be plottin'
Watch me burn this shit down, like Sodom and Gomorrah
My mama and father had some problems but regardless
It was obvious, I would be a fucking monster and a goblin
Killers move in silence but gorillas move with violence
And my niggas move with choppers, and maracas, and Obama’s
And the time here, llamas and the Tommy guns
Tomorrow never promised but I'm promising your time is up
Line em' up, eeny, meeny, miny, grab a shotty, everybody's fucked
Heard your bitch a hottie but she proudly, will not prolly fuck
Stomping out you soul until body jump, copy cut
Semicolon, space, point, comma, what? I'm a nut
Wave strong enough to fucking stop a truck
Smack you with a hockey puck, rip your fucking pockets off your Hollister

Climbing through your windows with a hollow pipe, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ninja blades, twin razors and an army knife, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ski mask rubber gloves, cutting all the lights, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Vest on, suited up like an armored knight, I can't wait for tomorrow night

Yo, I try and, I try and tell these niggas man
They not, they not fucking with me man, I, you know what I mean?
I've been doing this shit since I was like 9, 10, you know what I mean?
I can do this in my sleep nigga shit
You might also like
Son of an artist, I'm fucking bonkers, I roam with bosses
Fucking your daughters, your mothers, aunts, in your uncle’s office
Born in a carriage a couple horses while jumping off em'
The cops chasing, I fucking lost em' that's fucking awesome
Joyner the puppet master, I'm stabbing your lung and fracture your back
Till your nuts will crack in your sack to your fucking bladder
Funny how now suddenly everyone's a bunch of rappers
They just a bunch of band wagon hopping faggot maggots
Got magic racket, hacky sack it's in my khaki jackets
A cream colored hat to match it with it after taxes
These little hoes know my name they don't have to ask it
The rap assassin, I'm action Jackson the cash attack a freakaziod
Frankenstein, eat the boy, follow me on Twitter catch me at the BET award
Looks can be deceiving I'm the daemon in your ouija board
Sneaking through your basement I be creeping and I never make a freaking noise

Climbing through your windows with a hollow pipe, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ninja blades, twin razors and an army knife, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ski mask rubber gloves, cutting all the lights, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Vest on suited up like an armored knight, I can't wait for tomorrow night2Embed
