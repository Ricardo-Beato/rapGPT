This is another Missy Elliott exclusive

My twinkies look stinky on the Benz
And don't I gotta look sweet for my mens
And make 'em think I got a whole bunch of paper
And even date a ball player from the Lakers
Now fake a take and make 'em holler at ya later
Shake 'em, wake 'em, tell 'em what to get my ass from Jacob's
That's the way a real diva like to floss it
Buy a car no matter what is costs-es
Of courses, my Rolls Royces make 'em nauseous
Tell you who the motherfucking boss is
I'm driving, you walking, that's why you talking
See the chrome spinning on the wheels, stop jocking
I'ma let you know real nice and slow
I'd be broke as a joke if I had to be a ho
So poor, Missy on the rise like the sun
If you think that I'm done, I ain't even begun

Slide (Slide), slide (Slide)
Dip (Dip), shake (Shake), we gon' do it like this, y'all
Move it all around (Huh?)
Move it all around (Huh?)
Slide (Slide), slide (Slide)
Dip (Dip), shake (Shake), that's right
Move it all around (Come on)
Move it all around (Huh?)
You might also like
Feel the boombastic in ya back, kid
Fifteens putting holes in ya back, kid
Boom-boom-boom
Boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom
Don't it sound so fantastic?
My Lamborghini disappear like Houdini
Two-twenty can't see me, in the bottle like a genie
Teeny-weeny, now hate me like you hate to eat your Wheaties
Now here's a freebie, I'ma let you see me on TV
Accepting my Emmy or a Grammy in Miami
I hit you with the one-two whammy
Your no-tooth granny with a hole in her panties
And I don't give a shit if you can't stand me
'Cause I is what I is, and what I am is like my mammy
And I don't mean to sound too petty
But they use to call me fatty 'til I got with Puff Daddy

Slide (Slide), slide (Slide)
Dip (Dip), shake (Shake), we gon' do it like this, y'all
Move it all around (Huh?)
Move it all around (Huh?)
Slide (Slide), slide (Slide)
Dip (Dip), shake (Shake), that's right
Move it all around (Come on)
Move it all around (Huh?)
My rims keep turnin' and turnin'
Tires burnin' through Queens and Mount Vernon
And, yes, it's my concern that
Your chain Platinum or is it really Sterling?
I'm old school, I rock a Sherman
From New Jerz heard all the way to Berlin
And that's for certain, behind every curtain
Is a snake bitch lurking and she about to catch a hurtin'
Mr. Mos' on the beats (On the beats)
And Missy be the beats behind the beats (Behind the beats)
My record sales don't jump or do leaps
And while you sleep I'm on the ground as I creep
She creep, I got Pumas on my feet
Fresh gear every day, all week
You know I keep it hot for my peeps
Never cheap, underground like the streets

Slide (Slide), slide (Slide)
Dip (Dip), shake (Shake), we gon' do it like this, y'all
Move it all around (Huh?)
Move it all around (Huh?)
Slide (Slide), slide (Slide)
Dip (Dip), shake (Shake), that's right
Move it all around (Come on)
Move it all around (Huh?)2Embed
