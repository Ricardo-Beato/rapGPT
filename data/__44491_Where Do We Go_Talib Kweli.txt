16 ContributorsWhere Do We Go Lyrics
(Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah), yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah

Where do we go? What do we say? What do we do?
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run, and there's nothing new
Where do we go for inspiration?
It's like pain is our only inspiration
Where do we go? What do we say? What do we do?
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run, and there's nothing new
Where do we go for inspiration?
It's like pain is our only inspiration

Yeah, I see a place where little boys and girls
Are shells in the oceans, not knowin' they a pearl
No one to hold 'em while they growin'
They livin' moment to moment without a care in the whole world
Now, if I could help it, I tell it just like it is
And I may say some things that you don't like to hear
I know that, that people lie, people kneel
People die, people heal
People steal and people shed tears
What's real? Blood spills, gun kill, the sun still rise
Above me, trust me, it must be morning time
Wake up, the stakes up
Everybody want the cake up, to break up with the crew
But when the karma come back for what you do
It's too late to make up some excuse
You might also like
Where do we go? What do we say? What do we do?
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run, and there's nothing new
Where do we go for inspiration?
It's like pain is our only inspiration
Where do we go? What do we say? What do we do?
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run, and there's nothing new
Where do we go for inspiration?
It's like pain is our only inspiration

I come from people who stand stronger than time and space
Wherever there's competition, you gonna find the race
I find a place in my heart for this hip-hop
And pump blood through my vein, my skin get hot
I take you very serious and make you write more
If I don't celebrate, I got nothing to fight for
I'm tight raw, excite y'all like nightfall
I'm tight, y'all, I walk the street like y'all
About action, talk is cheap, right, y'all?
You start yappin', think about the beef you might cause (Yeah)
The trouble you could get into
You don't study, you not prepared and cats is testin' you
What you gonna do when you gotta face
The manifestation of the words that you put in space? (Yeah)
They already there, you can't take 'em out
The studio gangsta inside you tryna break out
Where do we go? What do we say? What do we do?
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run, and there's nothing new
Where do we go for inspiration?
It's like pain is our only inspiration
Where do we go? What do we say? What do we do?
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run, and there's nothing new
Where do we go for inspiration?
It's like pain is our only inspiration


Yeah, I see a place where little boys and girls
Are shells in the oceans, not knowin' they a pearl
No one to hold 'em while they growin'
They livin' moment to moment without a care in the whole world
Now, if I could help it, I tell it just like it is
And I may say some things that you don't like to hear
People lie, people kneel
People die, people heal
People steal and people shed tears
What's real? Blood spills, gun kill (Gun kill), the sun still rise (Rise)
Above me, trust me (Trust me, baby), it must be morning time (Morning time)
Wake up, the stakes up
Everybody want the cake up, to break up with the crew
But when the karma come back for what you do
It's too late to make up some excuse4Embed
