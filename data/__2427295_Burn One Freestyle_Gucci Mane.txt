Cheeeaaaaaa burn one
Zaytoven on da track imma burn one
Its the mixtape nigga burn one
If you eva try Gucci Mane you might burn one huh
Burn one, b-b-burn one
Get a half a pound of bubba kush and just burn one
Get a pint and da purp mix it wit it burn one
Call it burple call it purple bubba kush burn one

I stick em up, you know I hit em up
Patnas can't get em up, choppa bullets ate em up
Zone 6 it dangerous, we dont talk to strangers
Bang wit Glocks, bang wit 40s, and hammers
Glocks dat dont jam a bandanna im bananas
T.v. cameras damn he got damned em
Trick off wit dimes, I toucan sam em
Get pussy out cha mouth so i guess I pam em
100 bricks in the magnum I cram em
Gucci real handsome but I can't stand em
Gucci da scandalous, I rock like manson
The Hansen, the Olsen twins, I overstand em
Gucci keep talkin' bout bricks they gon' ban em
2007 yeent know, got damn em
Eazy-E swag wit Dr. Dre's focus
White lotus same color suntan lotion
Half a pound of purp' got the boy steady smokin', two days go and the boy still rollin
Half a pound of purp' got the boy still smokin', two days roll and the boy still goin
Gucci throwin' bricks its like he usin' a backboard
Shawty want the deuces, I charged her a stack for it
Got it by the bag get a whole or a half for it
Soulja to the scale so they get what they ask for it
Imported cocaine but i don't own a passport
Offset rims got me lookin Dale Earnheart
Blue and yellow jacob same color my paint job
Always tote gualas cuz i dont own a passport
Wit 6 inch decarters, gucci da landlord
J's neva get shit they get what they pay for
Shawty got a ass on her so I pay for it
Bred in the league so you know imma stay forward
Purple golden kush always call it the laker sack
Blue and yellow color dro call it the pacer pack
Green and white mid call it the celtics thrax
Say that you the weed man but wheres ya bells atYou might also likeEmbed
