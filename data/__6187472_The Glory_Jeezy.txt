7 ContributorsThe Glory Lyrics
Yeah
Oh it is what it is right here
Cass you a fool for this shit, nigga
Yeah, we gon' G-step tonight, baby
We gon' step in the name of glory, let's go
Yeah, uh
I'ma take y'all to the motherfuckin' club on this one, let's go, uh
Cincinnati, Tennessee, all my niggas in the D
Yeah look, look
Cleveland, Philly too, Chi-Town, VA, Bmore, what it do? What's up?

What's really goin' on?
Tellin' me I gotta put my feelings on this song
Tell 'em 'bout them devils playin' games in my mind
Ex drug dealer, still tryna be divine
Take a look in my thoughts, yeah you know what's on my mind
By any means yeah, that's just how I'm designed
We talk about the struggle, Michael Jackson in his prime
Even put 'em on a scale, 'til I seen that 9-9

Thug motivation, yeah I did it for the thugs
Wasn't for the money, I just done it for the love
Eyes wide shut, bitch I'm lookin' for the hate shit
Lookin' too real, I started lookin' for the fake, sheesh
You might also like
Hmm
Brown in my cup, stress on my mind
But I'll be fine, I'm gonna
G-step tonight (G-step), G-step tonight (G-step, G-step)
Oh, I know sometimes we got to smile to keep from cryin'
We're gonna, G-step tonight (G-step), G-step tonight (G-step, G-step)

Niggas still fishin' I ain't goin' for the bait
To focus on me, them motherfuckas gotta wait
Solid on solid, put that on my rep
When I'm on that brown liquor, got a mean two-step
To the left, to the right, it's about that time
And you ain't never heard that I don't got grind
If you in his paperwork, he done crossed that line
And if we talkin' paperwork, well we ain't talking 'bout mine

Call it motivation, yeah I done it for the thugs
Wasn't for the money, I just done it for the love
Eyes wide shut, bitch I'm lookin' for the hate shit
Lookin' too real, I started lookin' for the fake, sheesh
Solid on solid, I put that on my rep
When I'm on that brown liquor, got a mean two-step
To the left, to the right, it's about that time
And you ain't never heard that I don't got grind, sheesh
Hmm
Brown in my cup, stress on my mind
But I'll be fine, I'm gonna
G-step tonight (G-step), G-step tonight (G-step, G-step)
Oh, I know sometimes we got to smile, to keep from cryin'
We're gonna, G-step tonight (G-step), G-step tonight (G-step, G-step)

Niggas smear my name, should be mad at the motherfuckin' niggas that told on 'em
Doin' dirt on my name, should be mad at the motherfuckin' niggas that rode on 'em
All them singers in the club, should be mad at the motherfuckin' bitches, went cold on 'em
Same nigga 'bout some blow, same nigga in the motherfuckin' courtroom fold on 'em

Cincinnati, Tennessee, all my niggas in the D
Yeah look, look
Cleveland, Philly too, Chi-Town, VA, Bmore, what it do? What's up?Embed
