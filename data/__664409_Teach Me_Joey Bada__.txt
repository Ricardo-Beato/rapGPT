Won't you teach me how to dance, how to dance
Won't you teach me how to dance, teach how to dance

Okay now
Life's like, life's like
Just like a tango, tango
You gotta move that, move that
Don't break an ankle, ankle
Tell me if you see me, see me
From your angle, angle
I'll be your genie, genie
You be my angel, angel
Okay, how low can you go?
That half a million records sold
Soon as all the cash hit the floor
Cash is out and I'm bout to blow
Rock your body, go back and forth
It's a personal party, you're at the fold
Hundred girls in the lobby after the show that I bodied
And after the show they prolly wanna perform for me
Put on a show for the Papi that I prolly want to see
So tell me what its gonna be she said
"This hunny ain't free
It's the best kind that's around
So you have to pay the fee"

Won't you teach me how to dance, how to dance?
Won't you teach me how to dance, how to dance?
Won't you teach me how to dance, how to dance?
Won't you teach me how to dance?
(Teach me how to dance)

Let me show you how to groove, babe
How to move without a suitcase
Take a trip without a shoelace
I can lead you if you want
Let me help you move
Baby slide it
Give you a little bit of guidance
Enjoy the ride I'll be your pilot
You gotta glide it
Close your eyes, come fly
I'll show you how to vibe
Let me teach you how to dance, how to dance
I'mma teach you how to dance, how to dance, how to dance
Let me teach you how to dance, how to dance
I'mma teach you how to dance, how to dance, how to dance
Oooooh, oooooohhhhhh, oooohhhhh, oooooooohhhhh

Okay now
Life's like, life's like
Just like a salsa, salsa
You taste the spice right, spice right?
We need some water, water
Lately been caught up, caught up
These steps need order, order
Bring it in closer, closer
Let's combine auras, auras
Okay, right foot, left foot, let's go
Take my hand, take me 11 feet below
Bring it on there
What you got in store?
Rise up, look back at it
One jab at it
And I swear it's so rough, it's a bad habit
How I made the pussy dance?
How that happen?
We could call that magic
Say poof and our boots is tappin'
The sweetest taboo you practice
The sweetest juice that I have sip
I was raised by the Sycamore tree
I was told not to bite every apple I see
But somehow that's hard for me
Shorty make it clap, make it hard for me
Come grab the mic, spit a bar for me
Show me what you know, tell it all to me
Won't you teach me how to dance, how to dance?
Won't you teach me how to dance, how to dance?
Won't you teach me how to dance, how to dance?
Won't you teach me how to dance?
(Teach me how to dance)

Let me show you how to groove, babe
How to move without a suitcase
Take a trip without a shoelace
I can lead you if you want
Let me help you move
Baby slide it
Give you a little bit of guidance
Enjoy the ride I'll be your pilot
You gotta glide it
Close your eyes, come fly
I'll show you how to vibe
Let me teach you how to dance, how to dance
I'mma teach you how to dance, how to dance, how to dance
Let me teach you how to dance, how to dance
I'mma teach you how to dance, how to dance, how to dance
Oooooh, oooooohhhhhh, oooohhhhh, oooooooohhhhh

Teach me how to dance and groove me out my pants
And my body through a trance and fuck we just like a sin
Teach me how to dance and groove me out my pants
And my body through a trance and fuck we just like a sin31Embed
