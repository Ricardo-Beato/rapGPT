I know selling dope is wrong but I'm the dope man
One side of beans on my plate, I need some steak man
Got mouths to feed and my nigga's got to eat fam
By any means necessary, we don't give a damn

Praying to the Trap God
To the Trap God
I'm on my knees praying to the Trap God
Life's Hard
Life's so hard
Put your faith in god and you can be a Trap God
Trap God i'm a Trap God
The FEDS they try to label me as a drug czar
You a Trap God
You a Trap God
Put your faith in god and you can be a Trap God

Big Guwop the Trap God
But I don't think I'm god
Got a Challenger and a Charger ho
Bitch I'm in love with Dodge
I got body kits on all my cars
They hips like Nicki Minaj
And your girlfriends a masseuse she giving my dick a massage
And don't wear that body suit no more
Cause I'm gonna catch a charge
Multi-Million dollar CEO
Wearing Jordans to his job
Baby sucking my dick while I'm counting a million
She thinking she thinking she smart
The twentys and fiftys and hundreds she pull them apart
So she can keep all of the odds
You might also like

Am I a bad man cause I feed my fam with the dope
Call me clearance sale Gucci everything gotta go
Grill stove Guwop T-Shirts for the low
Hella green washing powder WalMart on Gresham road
Man these niggas say they killers
But these niggas just some ho's
Godzilla for a nigga
Cinderella for the hoes
Big Guwop they call me Trap God
Every verse a quote
I'm a walking egg beater
And the dope white like the pope
