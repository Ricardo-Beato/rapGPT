Ohhhh, ahhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ummmm, ohhhh

Hold on, let me explain
Sometimes I just don't know what to believe in
And I hate things that I said, I didn't mean them (Hm-hm)
So difficult tryna piece my thoughts
Don't wanna be no burden, I always piss you off
How could a man not wanna disappear? (Hmm)

I'm exposed and I am pure
No one makes me feel secure
Except you and now we're all in
All in, I am all in
Whatever happens, happens
We're all in, all in
I am all in
Whatever happens, happens

Why all the fussin', I can explain
I know your heart is all in no one takes your place
I hate the man that I was, so unbecoming (Hm-hm)
We're learning together anyhow
We're learning together right now
Facing the man that I was, tired of running
You might also like
I'm exposed and I am pure
No one makes me feel secure
Except you and now we're all in
All in (We're all in deep, baby), I am all in
Whatever happens, happens
We're all in, all in
I am all in
Whatever happens, happens

Happens, happens, happens, happens, happens
All in, all in, all in
Happens, happens, happens, happens, happens
All, all in, all in, all in, all in, all in
Whatever happens, happens16Embed
