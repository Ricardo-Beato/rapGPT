17 ContributorsAll of It Lyrics
Yeah (Buddah blessed this beat)
Yeah, hmm
Young Tina Snow, hot girl, but I'm cold (Ah) (Lil Tag)
Ayy

I got bluefaces, credit cards, wire transfers
Loggin' in his bank accounts, got the passwords
I want all of it, yeah, I need all of it (Ayy, ayy)
I want a scammer, shout out to JT
He can get it all as long as he got me
Make that shit hit, make them pieces work
As long as he got it, I'm makin' that shit twerk
I want all of it, yeah, I need all of it (Yeah, ah)

He want a piece of pie, but ain't shit sweet
And everything he doin', he know he doin' for me
I want all of it, yeah, I need all of it (Yeah)
I ain't a gold digger
But what the fuck I look like fuckin' broke niggas?
I'm a motherfuckin' millionaire
If you want a lame bitch, nigga, go and get a square
He tellin' me to come through, told that nigga, "Get me there" (Ayy)
I treat myself to villas, every trip, a private plane
I was here, disappeared, played a trick like David Blaine
Addicted to this life, I'll never give it up
I'm already rich, but on your time, I'll live it up
Champagne bottle, I'll take my time to sip it up
Rolls Royce full of rose petals when you pick me up (Ayy, ah)
You might also like
I got bluefaces, credit cards, wire transfers
Loggin' in his bank accounts, got the passwords
I want all of it, yeah, I need all of it (Ayy, ayy)
I want a scammer, shout out to JT
He can get it all as long as he got me
Make that shit hit, make them pieces work
As long as he got it, I'm makin' that shit twerk
I want all of it, I need all of it

All day
I watched you, I watched you, I watched you, I watched you
All day
I watched you, I watched you, I watched you, I watched you
All day
I watched you, I watched you, I watched you, I watched you
All day
I watched you, I watched you, I watched you, I watched youEmbed
