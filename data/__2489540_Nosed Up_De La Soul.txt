18 ContributorsNosed Up Lyrics
And in from the door steps a dumbass, struts the fool's gold
Know-it-all, and you wear it well
Funk-less in full-length
Too square to stand for anything
Somebody get that man a chair

No matter where you opt to sit
The opposite-attract law don't fit
Repel even the docile, always showing your nostrils
Got 'em hostile, the way you're so uppity
'Til someone barks on ya, you get puppy feet
Quite a laugh, 'cause you don't know half
But act like you own the whole puzzle
And everyone allegedly under you, begging just to guzzle
From your fountain of fresh (Hashtag), fuck outta here
They'd rather stay clear, roll up the papers and pass
While you turn your nose from the smell like Stanley on Friday
Saying we should stay off the grass
As if the lines you sniff is more healthy
Delusions of prestige is not where the health be
B, you need to get it together
But nah, here comes you, part Frank Drebin
Part Mr. Magoo, stay stepping into trouble
Oh so sadiddy when you're repping for your bubble
But bubbles can get popped, exposed to reality
Watch the words that drop, there's not enough salary
To cover the check before you're behind on cash
People can see you coming like 9/11 ash
Toxic 'til your last days, and with your shady maneuvers
No one will include you where they ass stays
You might also like
Behold your royal highness of sinus
It's near a hundred miles of running 'cause your nose needs plumbin'
Captain Nose-dive reporting for duty on the good ship Handkerchief
All aboard
And that goes for you too, Nostril-damus
He who knows nose
And from the from the rooty to the tooty, he defines snooty
Somebody asked me the other day is the brother a brother
Is Kleenex white?
Yeah, I see that

Like you got one eye on top of your third
A star is born but who's claimin' that birthright?
At first sight you the well-dressed Park Ave sachet
Acclimated to the scent of your own tail (The bullshit)
The same bull that rage when the buck stops
You'll be walkin' on clouds, but that's a smoke machine
See, your dineros can't buy bliss, you high fist then
Turn into you flippin' the bird
And every man under your wing
You build your nest egg, but you was spoiled rotten
Forgotten you can get robbed of your fame
Beak out like pelicans
You relishin' the fact that you stand feet from stardom
You bargain astonishin' antiques in this modern way of livin'
So tight and not a half size forgivin'
You takin' the piss, you got a butler in duplex
Them two Tecs and our God won't protect ya
Can't stay in them white gloves for too long, Mr. Handyman
Canaries don't chirp in your candy land
Give them motherfuckin' pigeons a hug
And then he strolls through the valley of dark
Nincompoop, simpleton
Stranger to his own father
Seldom down to get down
'Cause it never stays up
Well, I'm yours, son
We talkin' up there like a satellite
Species
Canis lupus, unfamiliar
What's happening, dog?
You smell more like pig to me

Be careful with your nose, bro
Be careful with your nose, bro
Be careful with your nose, bro
Be careful with your nose, bro1Embed
