18 ContributorsFire Water Lyrics
A lot of people wonder how they gon' die
How'm I gon' die?
Will it be a bullet wound?
Will they die at the hands of the police?
Here's how I think I'ma go

Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life
Fire water
Fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
Fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
Fire water
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life

I'm a animal, my splif's flammable
This is Hannibal, I'm a cannibal
It's understandable you think I'm studio
But when we leave the studio, nigga, you's the hoe
Niggas lose your hoe, like usual
Bitch is beautiful, what she with you for?
When Hiawatha drank my fire water said sayonara to his lonely daughter
Fire starter, mister arson
South Central Compton next to Carson
Rips are rippin', dogs are barkin'
Guppies all move over, let the shark in
Blood in the water, cuz in the water
Need to get out, nigga, was it a slaughter?
Fuckin' wit'chy'all niggas, tear in your drawers
This fire water put hair on your balls
This is a rebel without a pause
With three hoes like Santa Clause
Know all the pimp codes and the bylaws
Got enough paper, I could buy y'all
At the Bayou, I could buy you
Walkin' 'round here with a slave IQ
Better get smart or it's déjà vu
Back in the dark, nigga, chained to the ark, nigga, fuck
You might also like
Fire water
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life

How I do it is lighter fluid
Think you fly? Put a spider to it
Come down heavy, Isaac Newton
While y'all talkin', I be shootin'
Most of these artists be prostitutin'
Gangsta shit, I wrote The Constitution
Bitch ass nigga, what's your contribution?
Hatin' on shit ain't a revolution
Change this shit, fuck the lootin'
West side riders, I'm recruitin'
God is a teacher, I'm the student
Don't bite the apple, I'm rebootin'
Back to the pen and pad
Back to the pen and paper
Niggas wanna catch the vapors but they on respirators
Always on elevators
Always dressed like the Raiders
Always on my way to Vegas
Fire water
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life

My best wares? Louis chest hairs
Who wanna ball with the California bears?
It's Mardi Gras every time I'm with my players
Alcohol all in the air
I run this shit, I am the mayor
You a crazy bitch, Princess Leia
Don't'cha know my truth is a dare?
It's the cyclops with the eye drops
Fuck these thots and Goldilocks
Bitches wanna go and drink all a nigga porridge
Don't ask me for a piece of pizza
Fold my arms and say, "Bye Felisha"
Why the fuck you messin' with the creature?
Might wake up and fuckin' eat ya
Can hardly see ya 'cause of my shine
I'm legally blind
I'm outta my mind
Study my rhyme, I got the equation for any occasion
Black, white, brown, red, purple, or Asian
My fire water keep folks ablazin'
I got some shit that'll burn your stomach
Make you vomit, the dogs atomic
Please don't try to mix this with chronic
Niggas won't believe that you seen a comet, no
Fire water
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
I got that fire water
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life
Too much salt, too much sugar
Too much smoke and too much liquor
The good life, I'ma die of the good life
I'ma die of the good life
Fire water
Fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
Fire water
The shit I spit will get you lit
Fire water
I got that fire water
I got that fire water
I got that fire water
I got that fire water4Embed
