Bang

When I'm done countin' money
I gotta take a fuck me break
I should take a vacation
I should take a stuntin' break
I'm always takin' juice breaks
Got hit Thursday, told her don't hit me 'till Tuesday
Told her take a high break
Can you tell me what the sky say? (Sky say, bang)

On instagram I got a blue check
In my pocket got them blue checks
Just flew in on a blue jet
Got a draco, I ain't blew yet
Glock 17 blew 30 times
Where the pints, I need 30 lines
Hit the stu, drop 30 rhymes
Lil folks got a Glock, it's a dirty nine
You could take some shots, if you run it up
I'ma get the Guap, I'ma run it up
Off the blue strips to make your boo leave
Keep the ranch sauce, I want the blue cheese
You might also like
When I'm done countin' money
I gotta take a fuck me break
I should take a vacation
I should take a stuntin' break
I'm always takin' juice breaks
Got hit Thursday, told her don't hit me 'till Tuesday
Told her take a high break
Can you tell me what the sky say? (Sky say, bang)

Phone keep on vi-vibrating
Bitch want my time, save it-save it
Niggas don't speak my language-language
Looked up at God, save me-save me
Momma told me, stay out of jail-jail
My homie 'n 'em they got nail-nailed
Keep folks nem so solid, they ain't tell they ain't tell
Just bossin' shit, them knocked the train off the rail- off the rail
Momma told me, look boy be careful-careful
Momma told me, stand up on your legs
This bitch set up to stand up on my bed
Bitch cut the monkey, can you give me head-give me head

When I'm done countin' money
I gotta take a fuck me break
I should take a vacation
I should take a stuntin' break
I'm always takin' juice breaks
Got hit Thursday, told her don't hit me 'till Tuesday
Told her take a high break
Can you tell me what the sky say? (Sky say, bang)1Embed
