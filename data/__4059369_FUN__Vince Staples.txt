89 ContributorsFUN! Lyrics
One time, circling the block (The block)
Lil buddy got murdered on a flock
Two times, you know how we rock (You know how we rock)
You know who we knocked on, you know who we socked
You know how we comin', come from nothin', I got
Christian Dior, I'm Crippin' Björk
Made an uh-oh letting Vince in the door
Gave a little money to me, now I want more
Don't be lookin' funny when we come up in the store
My black is beautiful but I'll still shoot at you, dawg
2Pac, death tells all
Watch out for the niggas in the Lakewood mall
Get you touched, Nobu brunch
No big chains, no blue Chucks
Just big things, cuz gon' bust
'Cause short bus, but we ain't on one

We just wanna have fun
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
Fun, we don't wanna fuck up nothin'
And we don't give a fuck 'bout nothin'
We just wanna have fun
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
Fun, we don't wanna fuck up nothin'
And we don't give a fuck about nothin'
We just wanna have fun
You might also like
I'm so Norfy, my locs go viral for me
Ride slow, hop out, get hyphy
Think I know why he no like me
He broke, we know, citch
He told, he on print
Black and white like old flicks
We blam, he dance like Otis, I'm owed this
Give me all the money in my hand
Type of money pop a rubber band
Miss with the glitz and the glam
Fried catfish at The Ritz in Japan
Yeah, keak'n baby, tell me when to go (Tell me when to go)
Tweakin', I'ma leave him on the floor (Leave him on the floor)
Ricky in the alley, adiós
But we don't want the smoke

We just wanna have fun
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
Fun, we don't wanna fuck up nothin'
And we don't give a fuck 'bout nothin'
We just wanna have fun
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
Fun, we don't wanna fuck up nothin'
And we don't give a fuck about nothin'
We just wanna have fun
Mack a bitch down, mack a bitch down (Mack a bitch)
Mack a bitch down, mack a bitch down (Mack a bitch)
Mack a bitch down, mack a bitch down (Mack a bitch)
Mack a bitch down, mack a bitch down (Mack a bitch)
We don't need no circus in this bitch
We just wanna have fun, we just
(Wanna have fun, what's happenin'?)
We don't need no circus in this bitch
We just wanna have fun, we just
(Wanna have fun, what's happenin'?)
Mack a bitch down, mack a bitch down (Mack a bitch)
Mack a bitch down, mack a bitch down (Mack a bitch)
Mack a bitch down, mack a bitch down (Mack a bitch)
Mack a bitch down, mack a bitch down (Mack a bitch)
We don't need no circus in this bitch
We just wanna have fun, we just
(Wanna have fun, what's happenin'?)
We don't need no circus in this bitch
We just wanna have fun, we just
(Wanna have fun, what's happenin'?)
