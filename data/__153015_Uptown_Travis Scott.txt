91 ContributorsUptown Lyrics
Uh

I'm riding up uptown (Woo)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick
I'm a motherfucking monster (Woo)
You riding up uptown (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick

At the green light I'm speeding
Fourth wheel on, I'm weaving
I got red eyes and swag seizures
All my concerts filling them bleachers
Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us
Tossed in a little more dank
And a little more drank than La Flame might need
Tito Puente with the candy top
Fuck around, make the Latinas pop (Hmm)
It's a new world order (Hmm)
Never had my head on my shoulders (Huh)
Beware of the monsters
Ain't that what your preacher told ya? (Uh)
La Flame, 500 degrees
From the uptown to the Magnolia
You might also like
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
I'm riding up uptown (Woah)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
One hand on the wheel (Yeah, uh, uh)

Damn you gorgeous, tell me something I don't know
Dice on the corner with the lights low
Got the base in my sock, fuck the 5-0
Damn you conscious
Gon' get your head off the plate though
Let me show you lil' Yamamoto
Take a little lick of the mayo
Out on 135th, spending them pesos
Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg keep the back locked
'Cause we got a little bit of Tango (Yeah)
Real nigga from the South to the East they feel a nigga
Bangin' wax since a nigga get a wait
Take a little taste, leave you numb feeling in the face
I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weekend hell
XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill (Um)
Chain links, by nigga, popular demand nigga
My bitch pearls from the clams, nigga
She can ride the dick no hands (Uh)
While I'm riding uptown (Woo, wooh)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo, uh, woo)

(Huh, yeah)
It's that young Fergenstein (Little Frankenstein!)
Pockets full of Benji Franklins, teacher, stay in line
Cannot take a break, in time, I'll take ya shine
Take your bitch, hit it from the back, I'll break her spine
I'm a lady, your bitch look like Shanaynay
Margiela so cold feel like Tommy gettin' his payday
Going nuts like a Payday, bitches thinking I'm crazy
My fraternity is the burna heat, I'm a Kappa nigga with an AK-ay
Barking loud like Q-Dogs (Woo), moving niggas like U-Hauls (Woo)
Pussy niggas so RuPaul, you pussies get me tight like blue balls
(Woo, woo, woo, ayy)

I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Monster)
I'm riding up uptown (Woo)64Embed
