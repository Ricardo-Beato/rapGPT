15 ContributorsIn They Feelings Lyrics
They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga, I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing

I'm a problem, niggas know 'dat
Hop out, grab the black MAC, no Kodak
Rockstar like Jack Black, I'm playing like Mick Jagg
No playing, get rich fast, then sit back
Huh, soak it all in
I spoke it, now it's happening, they hope it all end
Niggas rather hate than get in they own bag
It's funny because I always put money over that mad shit
Tell me, tell me, what that fuck you gaining from it?
Hating while I'm in the club and it's raining money
That shit is draining you, paining your fucking brain, and you
Straining yourself out, tryna get all that clout off my name

They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga, I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing
They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga, I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing

When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together
When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together4Embed
