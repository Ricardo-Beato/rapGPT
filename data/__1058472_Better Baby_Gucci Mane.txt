7 ContributorsBetter Baby Lyrics
I know that I need her (Huh)
But don't know how to treat her (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
Though I wanna keep her (Huh)
Be jealous if she leave, uh (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
And I can't hold you back, baby

Damn, I think I love her, but I don't really know her good
Know I wanna fuck her, but really thinking if I should
How can I believe her? I don't even believe myself
Tell me how to trust her, I can't even trust myself
And I can't live alone, at the end of the day, can't fuck myself
I told her I'm confused and she told me to go fuck myself
Now I'm alone in this world, nothing left but me
But I was born all alone, so I guess that's how it's meant to be
But she was sent to me, and I didn't recognize
And I blame it on my pride on the fact I'm sittin' in silence
Eyes redder than a rose, heart bluer than a violet
My heart broke and I'm heartless and ain't no need to hide it
Gucci
You might also like
I know that I need her (Huh)
But don't know how to treat her (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
Though I wanna keep her (Huh)
Be jealous if she leave, uh (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
And I can't hold you back, baby

A heart breaking is heart broke
I'ma tell the truth 'cause we grown folks
Why you lookin' through my phone for?
That's why we ended up none more
You don't know me like John Doe
Done left me up in my condo
Looking for you like Waldo, my nose open like Gunzo
I think I love her I don't know
I like her a lot, but she loco
She crazy, swagged out
I try to hug her she want more
In and out of town all the time
She in and out my mind all the time
I can't lie baby girl stupid fine
But I'm out the tush got that stupid grind
She loves me now or she loves me not
Treat me cold or she treat me hot
Caramel, but not apricot
Got one chance, won't miss the shot
I know she special, yeah, a lot
I know someone might take ma spot
Can't lie, it may hurt a lot
But uh, she need a man or not (It's Gucci)
I know that I need her (Huh)
But don't know how to treat her (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
Though I wanna keep her (Huh)
Be jealous if she leave, uh (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
And I can't hold you back, babyEmbed
