5 ContributorsQuestions Lyrics
I swear that I fall in love way too easily
When I don't need to be
Cuz none of them really believe in me
They all deceiving me
Just telling me what I want to hear
If they not real, then I don’t want them here
Cuz nowadays, it's hard to find a real girl cuz they just not as real
Call me a failure, I don't gotta deal
The stress make you swallow a lot of pills
And jump off the tallest hills
All this cuz you didn’t call him still

Now tell me, do you love me
We had a couple problems, do you trust me
You can't get rid of me that easy, girl your mama love me
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going
So tell me where are we at
You got a couple girls, now where they be at
And even though I broke your heart, I'm hoping that you'll be back
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going down

It’s been a couple years since I heard rap that impressed me
So tell me how the odds are stacking against me
That can upset me
A couple girls say I sound like Drake, like that should impress me
All that do is offend me
My patience running on empty
A lot of ladies want me to fall in love, but I’m not falling
Ignored Leia till she stopped calling
Maybe that's too much
I ain’t one for love, I play with it too much
Leia can't take me serious, cuz I'm faking it too much
Now what's the first name of this fucking girl that I’m feeling on
I'm cheating on girls that I got feelings for
Ain't hard to tempt me
Girl, we can build like them architects be
You call me your dawg and friendly
But inside my heart you defend me

Now tell me, do you love me
We had a couple problems, do you trust me
You can't get rid of me that easy, girl your mama love me
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going
So tell me where are we at
You got a couple girls, now where they be at
And even though I broke your heart, I'm hoping that you'll be back
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going down
Fade to another dimension, as we getting eternal
Love burn like inferno, fall too easy I've learned though
To never trust, but never live in forever lust
L's, we want a better us, as we develop rust
But women, as a whole, overall are just fake as shit
And the ones who be snaking shit, want relationship
But on the other hand, fuck bitches, get rubber bands
And understand, never trust anyone other than
Those that was with you before you got official
And the day ones, that never forget where you fucking came from
Cuz when I found myself needing something, no one's around to help
So I switch it up, lift it up
And found it in myself

Now tell me, do you love me
We had a couple problems, do you trust me
You can't get rid of me that easy, girl your mama love me
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going
So tell me where are we at
You got a couple girls, now where they be at
And even though I broke your heart, I'm hoping that you'll be back
I was lost, now I'm found
I done came back around
Was the man of the town
Now I'm just going down
Now tell me, do you love me
We had a couple problems, do you trust me
You can't get rid of me that easy, girl your mama love me
Tell me where we at
You got a couple girls, now where they be at
And even though I broke your heart, I'm hoping that you'll be back1Embed
