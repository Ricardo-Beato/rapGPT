34 ContributorsNolia Lyrics
When I put that shit on, I can walk in the sky
Danny told gang if he lie to your eye
'Cause them folks lose it, they start switchin' sides
Cussin' went down, all I could say was, "Damn"
Told him you gotta cut loose of your ties
Said this here way before niggas was on
I said this shit back when it was the rise
The whip's gettin' bigger, the hoes gettin' badder
The bag's gettin' fatter
Don't gotta take shit now, it's with you, jurassic
Gettin' tatted on E, check the before and after
LL Cool with your main ho, oh
Gotta get head like a Kangol, oh
Gotta keep a stick like the Jenga, uh
I don't give a fuck what you say 'bout me
I'm a real nigga 'til the day I die
Real ass niggas, they fuck with me
I'm a young nigga with a pole in the club
Call Big Twon, put a hole in a scrub
Pussy ass nigga, stop playin' with me
Nigga mad his main bitch layin' with me
On the internet, boy, that ain't G

All at the Grove, yeah (Lil Boat)
Hot as a stove, yeah (Yeah)
Breakin' the bank down (Breakin' the bank)
My bitch from the Nolia (My bitch from the Nolia)
Whippin' the whip 'round (Whippin' the whip)
Shawty, she been down (Shawty, she been)
Shawty, she been down (Shawty, she been)
Bitch from the Nolia (Shawty, she been)
You might also like
She got a Benz coupe with a Jeep
She might affect you when you speak
She got a gimp suit, it's for me
I don't pretend to, gotta beat
She kinda slim-thick, she a freak
She got a friend too, and she eats
Suck my 10'2" once a week
I got a life, she don't intervene
No longer Sprite, still sippin' lean
Gold on ice, enter in immediately
Bling goin' blaow, regular procedure
I'm in the clouds right now
Out of precedin' with the precedings, baby, we decent
Jump out of step
Your bitch from the Nolia, my bitch out the MILF
Have it controlled when I run out of breath
Walk in the forum and bust in the skrip
Then we preform and take us a trip
Bitch out of Inglewood with the sip
That's who been servin' me every rip
I just went vroom, huh, in a 'Vette
Jumped in a Cadillac CTS
Headed to H-Town, GPS
You gon' be seein' me on TV next
All at the Grove, yeah
Hot as a stove, yeah (Yeah)
Breakin' the bank down (Breakin' the bank)
My bitch from the Nolia (My bitch from the Nolia)
Whippin' the whip 'round (Whippin' the whip)
Shawty, she been down (Shawty, she been)
Shawty, she been down (Shawty, she been)
Bitch from the Nolia (Shawty, she been)

I'ma make your name hot (Hot)
He no seein' thot
Brother called my phone from jail (Called my phone)
Send his ass a green dot (Dot)
He talk down, nigga talked down, get hit with the green dot (Dot)
I'll drop my damn top (Skrrt)
This too easy
These rap niggas cheesy
I'ma fuck that bitch like a dog, that bitch act sleezy
And I know she need me
My bitch from the Nolia, just like Lil Weezy
Eatin' on linguine
She off a beanie (Pop), but she still full alert
Glock 13-y, she can tuck it right in her skirt
Rub my wood (Rub my wood)
Just like a genie (Just like a genie)
Make 'em go poof (Make 'em goâ€”)
Just like Houdini (Just like Houdini, yeah)
All at the Grove, yeah (Lil Boat)
Hot as a stove, yeah (Yeah)
Breakin' the bank down (Breakin' the bank)
My bitch from the Nolia (My bitch from the Nolia)
Whippin' the whip 'round (Whippin' the whip)
Shawty, she been down (Shawty, she been)
Shawty, she been down (Shawty, she been)
Bitch from the Nolia (Shawty, she been)1Embed
