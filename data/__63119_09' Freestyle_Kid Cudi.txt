25 Contributors09' Freestyle LyricsBorn to do it
Even though all my friends lookin at me like who knew it
Run to it
The hoods just spit by new nigga
Feel cats talkin like who nigga
Is he
Where did he come from CL
My mom prayed for me on my journey
Treat me like an alien something like sigourney
Live through the game for the fame and the gurney
Tried to put me on the pedestal
Hoes treated me like who are you
Now I get to choose like you and her too
I just like girls not whores
But I have a chill time make s'mores
But if I wanna plow someone like a snow blower
I can work that ass like a workout plan
And then I holla at fam
Talkin bout Ye, Don C., Jigga man
Been representing since I met 'Quence and I get style tips from my homeboy Ibn
Common's the homie
Really Doe is the homie
GLC is the homie
And Big Sean what a gwan'
I go monkey paw on the record and they think I’m cookoo
Niggas is sign and dated like they recorded in fubu
Most niggas will quote you play scrabble with your words man
Till you see them at your shows is my dick that they blow man
I would sit up some nights and think about my own place
Probably cause I took so many blunts of Kush to the face
My bad thoughts I can’t erase
Or eat what’s on the devils plate
I just tell the devil wait
Cause murder will not be the case
In london with hudson
And them girls want some cuttin
I’m with him so I’m cool
Plus my face on the telly
But I’m pissed at the moment
I got charged for some roamin'
AT&T is some bullshit man I wish they’d stop frontin'
But when I roll back to brooklyn
Hit the store for a dutchie
I say homie keep rappin
I say homie its nothin
I’m
This is
Dream on
Now when I roll back to cleveland
Hit the store for a phillie
Niggas tell me keep rappin
Cause them young niggas feel me
Hear me
Hah hem
Hear me
Yep yep
Hear me
Yep yep yep
Hear me
Hear me
When I roll out to cali
Hit the store for a swisher
Niggas tell me keep rappin
I say homie I get'cha
Hear me
Hear me
Cudder
This is the Dopest shit
Hope Niggas like that shit
