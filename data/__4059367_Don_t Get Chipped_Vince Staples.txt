80 ContributorsDon’t Get Chipped Lyrics
Can't wait ’til I'm rich, I'm finna buy a whole crate of guns
For my naughty Crips, shit I really came from the slums
Time to represent, let me see you bang, where you from?
Don’t be acting spooked, I'm a troop, I don't give a fuck
I just wanna live it up, used to make 'em give it up
Flockin' is for hoes, I'ma take somebody soul
He don't give me what he own, now I'm getting what I’m owed
You ain’t seen me at a show? Oh, you missing out
Swear I bring the realest out
Everybody know me who's somebody to know
(Who somebody to know)
Watch me mind my business while I’m counting my dough
(While I'm counting my dough)
Stay away from citches who would clown me before
(Who would clown me before)
On the road to riches, they gon' step on your toes
Sammy told me that a change gon' come (Gon’ come)
I'm not going if my gang won't come (Won't come)
If you see me pull that thang, don't run (Don't run)
Playing ball, if I swing home run

I ain't on that medication
It's only money that I'm chasing, that is all
Represent my location
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Nigga, I ain't got the patience, yeah
I hustle like a mental patient, I'm tryna ball
Let me run my demonstration
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped, don't get chipped

Everybody say it's lonely at the top
I want my homies at the top
My little homie, he got shot
And now I'm moving by my lonely with the .40 and the mop
Finna pull up early morning and somebody getting dropped
I throw a party on your block, like I'm Tommy the clown
Hundred thousand dollar car, bet you proud of me now
Took my mama out the set, house as big as my mouth
Started yelling out requests, so I shot in the crowd, pow
You a fan, I'm the man, it's a difference (It's a difference)
Stop pretending (Stop pretending)
You know you feel it (You know you feel it)
Record deal, but I did it independent (Independent)
If I peel, then somebody going missing
Brandy told me they just wanna be down (Wanna be down)
I'm the nigga that they wanna be now (Wanna be now)
Who done did it like I did it from the hometown?
Started dead broke, but I'm on now

I ain't on that medication
It's only money that I'm chasing, that is all
Represent my location
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Nigga, I ain't got the patience, yeah
I hustle like a mental patient, I'm tryna ball
Let me run my demonstration
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped, don't get chipped12Embed
