21 ContributorsGone To The Moon Lyrics
I'm gone to the moon
I'm gone to the moon
I'm gone to the moon
I float like balloons
I'm gone to the moon
I'm gone to the moon
I'm gone to the moon
I float like balloons

Yeah, I smoke a box of blunts for breakfast
Ay, and I woke up like Hugh Hefner ay
I had to switch her out my old phone
Ay, and I just got back from Tokyo ay
I put spikes on all my chucks now ay
I'm in pluto I ain't coming down ay
And I'm cooking Amy Winehouse ay
And it's stinking up the whole house ay
I been mix matchin' designers ay
I get a hundred dollar line up ay
I bought the plasma for the weekend ay
You better see what my little beat in

I'm gone to the moon
I'm gone to the moon
I'm gone to the moon
I float like balloons
I'm gone to the moon
I'm gone to the moon
I'm gone to the moon
I float like balloons
