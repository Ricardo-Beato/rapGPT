Boy, hold my jewelry, it's a pound, ayy
Brick on my wrist right now, ayy (DP on the beat)
And I'm finna go and scoop your bitch, ayy
And I'm finna go and scoop some kicks, ayy
Finna pull up on my ex, ayy
Pull up on my ex, make that bitch mad, ayy
I ain't got no fucking type of respect, ayy
But I heard you get respect with TEC's, ayy

Boy, hold my jewelry, it's a pound, ayy
Brick on my wrist right now, ayy
And I'm finna go and scoop your bitch, ayy
And I'm finna go and scoop some kicks, ayy
Finna pull up on my ex, ayy
Pull up on my ex, make that bitch mad, ayy
I ain't got no fucking type of respect, ayy
But I heard you get respect with TEC's, ayy

D-Moe go grab the pound (D-Moe go grab the pound)
Thots coming over to suck us right now (They comin' to suck us right now)
Roll up, let's get high (Let's get high, bitch)
Smoke a nigga, fry him (Smoke a nigga, fry him, bitch)
Let him come up in this fucking house (In this house)
Pistol to his motherfuckin' mouth (To his fuckin' mouth, bang)
I told him watch his motherfuckin' mouth (Told him watch his mouth, gang)
Who the fuck talkin' now? (Talkin' now)
Flexin', look at my muscle (Look at my motherfuckin' muscle)
My truck got a muscle (Truck got a motherfuckin' muscle)
It ain't American, it's foreign (Bitch, it's foreign)
My bitch ain't American, she foreign (My bitch is foreign)
She is from Dubai (Dubai)
I got that check, then I flew by, I roll by (Flew by)
Didn't stop for nobody (Nobody)
I don't fuck with nobody (Fuck with nobody, though)
I'm hardbody, fuck your body and your party
We gon' come through, shoot your party (Shoot your party)
Who told you to party? Not Glo Gang (Glo Gang, bitch)
Fuckboy, you's a no-name (You's a no)

Boy, hold my jewelry, it's a pound, ayy
Brick on my wrist right now, ayy
And I'm finna go and scoop your bitch, ayy
And I'm finna go and scoop some kicks, ayy
Finna pull up on my ex, ayy
Pull up on my ex, make that bitch mad, ayy
I ain't got no fucking type of respect, ayy
But I heard you get respect with TEC's, ayy

I just bought a chop, let's do a hit
You wifin' her, she doing dicks
I got a 30 with a stick
I'm Glo Gang, we hella rich
These niggas hate, but niggas bitches
These niggas tellin', niggas snitches
And you know snitches, they get stitches
Pulling up and you get digits
Talking numbers, hundred rounds
Catch you lacking, it's man down
When I kill you, I'ma frown
Ain't no fucking laughing, playing around (DP on the beat)48Embed
