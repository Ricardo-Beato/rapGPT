72 ContributorsBells of War Lyrics
Give me the cue

Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good, Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm, yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the phantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine, holding nine Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down, would you crown renowned kings

There's no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound to MCs, thumbs down
Prepare Killa Bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here, hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city, call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flare, truth or dare?
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny B. Goode or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on, you've been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon, how many bombs
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now?
Walk a mile in my shoes, get the street news from Meth-Tical

Glocks'll be spitting, you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocks'll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo

It's common sense how I master my circumference, you dense
I get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
Can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level, yo, I stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding, penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style, your weak proposal
Aim for the official, initial is Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissible
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible, every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain 'Unforgettable' like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Buy Melchezidek a skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor, Wu-Tang
The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang

Motherfuckers
We be seeing y'all asses when we walk up in the club
Y'all all in the back
Scared to speak, we speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker, we know what time it is

All you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit, right
It's like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfucking Whitaker
Dang, he caught Whitaker
He caught Whitaker a long time ago
Mike got touched
Then Mike got touched by Holyfield
Hey Mike's, Mike's gonna forfeit this fight
He ain't fighting McDermit
He ain't fighting
Nope
Whattup
You talking bout he, what he, what he, what he did
Told them he cut his eye, in sparring
Stella D'oro wrap breadsticks, David Berkowitz
Einstein birthed a hit, now nurture it
M.G.M. front row seat tonight, no gems
Purify, cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off, Wu-Tang tore me off the cross
All you saw was white meat, skin hanging off
These is words from the Arch Bishop, some call it six up
The Betty Crocker Marvel cake, snakes will miss a
Wax janitor, black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance, tarantula style, you's a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's off the hook, let's push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist, Soul Controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth fist, swift and boneless

You know cause Wu-Tang is invincible, you know what I mean
It's Wu-Tang Forever God
You gonna get down with that W
That's that Wu, that's that Wisdom
That's the Wisdom of the Universe
That's the truth, of Allah, for the Nation of the Gods, you know what I'm sayin'
We breaking egg through these days God, you know what I'm sayin'
We got the fucking way
We got the medicine for your sickness
Out here, ya know what I mean
I was telling Shorty like
Yo Shorty, you don't even gotta go to summer school
Pick up the Wu-Tang double CD
And you'll get all the education you need this year, you know what I mean
Their poisoned minds can't comprehend this shit
Word man it's Wu-Tang Forever God, you know what I mean
Niggas can't fuck with these lyrics God, you kno what I'm sayin
Namean
Oh hell no, none of this shit
C'mon man -- beats, lyrics man, y'all niggas
Niggas can't even understand half this shit
I think niggas ain't gonna figure it out til the year Two-G
(Wax niggas ass for free or fee) Word
Yo, you know what
The next Wu-Tang album ain't even coming out until 2000, ya know what I mean
That's just gonna come back with a comet
You hear, we gonna bring a comet
Check for that shit in the millenium
You know what I mean? So, yo, y'all niggas man
Be the resurrection
The Gods is here man
Born Gods is here3Embed
