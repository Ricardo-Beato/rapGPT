Da-la, la-la-la-la, la-la, yeah
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

Wake up from a dream
She's my ever-everything
I need her more than anything
She's my tranquility (Uh)
I can't go to sleep
Without her next to me
So I'm sure she's the one for me (Me, uh)

Trapped in my head, she has the key
She walks me to her bed, I can't wait to see the freaky things
She does to me
All her old niggas, they are under me
But back to you, baby, you're a Picasso piece
Yes, indeed, you're lovely and I can't help it
Follow me through the hell and the storm
Honestly, feel like I've been here before
Probably visited here in my dreams
I came here looking for you
To know that you're all I need
You might also like
Wake up from a dream
She's my ever-everything
I need her more than anything
She's my tranquility (Uh)
I can't go to sleep
Without her next to me
So I'm sure she's the one for me (Me)

Baby, you're the champ (Uh)
Got you soakin' when I'm in it, it's way more than damp
You got so fuckin' wet I had to build a dam
Talk about good romance
Baby, looky, looky (Looky, looky)
I'ma eat you like studio cookies, oh
You ain't dealin' with a rookie (Rookie)
But I'm fresher than a fuckin' rookie, oh
You be in Jersey like you Snookie (Snookie, Snookie)
But I know you really came from Philadelph'
Just like Meek Milly, oh, got my Gucci sweats on
Tryna feel it through the pants, through the drawers
Fuck her good, she sleep it off

Wake up from a dream
She's my ever-everything
I need her more than anything
She's my tranquility (Uh)
I can't go to sleep
Without her next to me
So I'm sure she's the one for me (Me)
Hit-Boy
