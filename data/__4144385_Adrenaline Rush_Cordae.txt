5 ContributorsAdrenaline Rush Lyrics
It was five of us in a Volvo
Not thinking about tomorrow
Cuz we was living in sorrow
But hopefully, I could borrow
Some food for though cuz niggas is money hungry
Take us through the parties, where there's plenty hunnies
And liquor, hooked up to this nigga
He pull out the trigger, and hit my man
Adrenaline rush and so shit I ran and did everything that I can
Till my sore knee just popped out of place
Then they stopped my way, and noticed I was rocking J's
So we pull out the Glock and spray
Not knowing what else to do, I play dead, lay down
The irony of it all, I started to pray now
God said, "What do you want from me
Cuz you only call when your really want something
Not when you in front, running"
I said, "Treat you right, man, my sinning is true
Always put myself in danger and depending on you"
So we hopped in the car and dashed
Hit the pedal, going fast
And a quarter mile later, car ran out of gas
Like, damn that shit's amazing
Damn that shit's amazing
Cuz I always end up in a crazy situation
I swear, I can't even tell my friends from my enemies
Know too many people, swear that's gonna be the end of me
Cuz

Lord forgive me, I commited a sin
Cuz problem is, I'm probably gonna do it again
Cuz I'm just so stupid
And I'm just so clueless
And I always go through it
I swear, I'll do it again
Lord forgive me, I commited a sin
Cuz problem is, I'm probably gonna do it again
Cuz I'm just so stupid
And I'm just so clueless
And I always go through it
I swear, I'll do it again

Very nervous, so I'm covered in sweat
Cuz niggas is coming with bloodlust and a tech
And left for no other option
So if they come, enough problems
So imagine, going through without Batman and you got him
They pull up in a stratus
Bringing out automatics
And then start loading and blasting
But that's not even as tragic
It's magical, I survived
Battle death on my mind
Can't go yet, I gotta jet, this might just threaten my grind
So my keys jangling, thoughts sinking, it might not make it
Get a chance we gon' take it
Till they, "Damn this nigga made it"
The jewels, watch, phone, and finally my Jordans
I'm thinking over what's more important
Mind is distorted
My heart is filled with malice and hate, no way to avoid it
You either lose your pride or die, you know the choices
Hopped in the minivan, I ain't backing out from that man
Took off his mask, gassed at last
Shit that was my man, but damn
Lord forgive me, I commited a sin
Cuz problem is, I'm probably gonna do it again
Cuz I'm just so stupid
And I'm just so clueless
And I always go through it
I swear, I'll do it again
Lord forgive me, I commited a sin
Cuz problem is, I'm probably gonna do it again
Cuz I'm just so stupid
And I'm just so clueless
And I always go through it
I swear, I'll do it again1Embed
