(DJ Chose)
(P Crisco)
Yeah, yeah, I put that 1501 chain around my neck and now it's lit

All the hot girls, make it pop, pop, pop (Pop, pop)
Bad bitches wit' the bag, say “I", (Ya, ya)
If he ain't talkin' 'bout no money, tell him, “Bye, bye, bye” (Boy, bye)
And if you see a mad ho, tell her, “Hi, hi, hi" (Hey)
Don't get mad, ho (Get mad), get a bag, ho (Get a bag)
Don't get mad, ho (Get mad), get a bag, ho (Get a bag)
Don't get mad, ho, fuck a broke hoe (Ooh)
Don't get mad, ho (Get mad), get a bag, ho (Ah)

Spicy, pricey, neck and wrist icy
Bitch, it's moneymaking Megan, ho, get like me
I rode it, a soldier, a hot girl, he want it (Uh)
Pull up in that Masera', gettin' top on lock (Skrrt)
They still tryna find a thing that I can't do
I told her, “If you go against me, you a damn fool” (Bitch, you dumb)
But keep talkin' 'bout me, bitch, that's all you can do (Oh, okay)
But keep my cat up out ya mouth 'cause that's your man food
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (She like "What?")
I know you crunk but lil' bih, please watch my shoes (Goddamn)
I'm not the DJ but I'll make your body move (Goddamn)
Watch your mouth before I leave here wit' your boo (Ah)

Lil' thundercat, throw it back, he can't handle that
I'on want to talk unless a nigga finna throw a stack
Bad attitude but I'm cute so he call me "bae"
I'ma need that head, give me neck like a vertebra
Check my body, oochie wally, where your wallet?
If I take your nigga, it's nothing you can do about it (Not at all)
I'm the fucking hottie, I'm not your momma or your partner
So don't play with me, bitch, I'm from Texas, we get rowdy
I got my hands up on my knees, I'm 'bout to work him out his jeans
He get behind me, I'ma QB, throw it back and wide receive
Your nigga wish he had me, boy, your BM ashy
And I'm cocoa-buttered down, pretty brown bad B

I can make your man do what I want him to do (Oh, yeah)
'Cause when he seen me, he ain't want to fuck with you (Not at all)
I point down at this candy, told him what he finna chew
And tease you with the nigga, Nanny Nanny Boo Boo
Ayy, I want some money, yeah, I want some money
And he gon' bring it to Megan, do what I say like his mommy
I wrap that dick like a mummy, he do not run when I'm cumming
He open up and he catch it, he suck these titties, these leches
I throw that booty, he fetch it, this pussy really a present
I got the Michael, that Thriller, these bitches hiding they niggas
I got that now and that later, he gon' eat through the paper
He tryna eat through these panties, he bob his head like he jammin' (Ah)

All the hot girls, make it pop, pop, pop (Pop, pop)
Bad bitches wit' the bag say “I", (Ya, ya)
If he ain't talkin' 'bout no money, tell him, “Bye, bye, bye” (Boy, bye)
And if you see a mad hoe, tell her, “Hi, hi, hi" (Hey)
Don't get mad, ho (Get mad), get a bag, ho (Get a bag)
