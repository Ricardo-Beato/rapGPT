9 ContributorsI Gotta Hurt You Lyrics
You know
I could love you with all my heart
You're my baby and
And I love you I just
I just feel the need to hurt you
Maybe I'm scorn
Maybe I need a therapist
Maybe I'm petty
I just

I want to hurt you
I want to hurt you
I want to hurt you
I need to make you sure you remember me forever
E-e-e-e-ever
E-e-e-e-ever
E-e-e-e-ever
(I was raised well)
E-e-e-e-ever
E-e-e-e-ever
E-e-e-e-ever
I want to hurt you
I want to hurt you
I want to, I want to hurt you
I want to hurt, hurt, hurt
I want to hurt you
(Forever)
I want to hurt you
I want to, I want to hurt you
(Forever)
I want to hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
I want to hurt you
You might also like
I want to hurt you
I got to make sure that you feel me
I need to make sure you remember me forever
I have to show you

Hi there
My name is, my name is
Cardi, Cardi, Cardi, Cardi
I don't know
I love it
I love it
Lonelyness
It fulfills my sorrow
You may think
You may think I have no tomorrow
Its easier to die
Than to live
But I will show you
That I'm strong enough
To use you and abuse you
And I'm gonna live
And I'm gonna win (haha)
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I-I-I-I-I'm go-onna win
I want to hurt you
I got to make sure that you feel me
I need to make sure they remember me forever
I have to show you3Embed
