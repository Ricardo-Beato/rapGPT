10 ContributorsRider Lyrics
Whatchu lookin for
I'm lookin for a bitch
That'll stay down for a nigga through thick and thin

Would you ride for yo nigga
That's all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga 
That's all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider

Got a bankroll now full of hundreds
I could let you blow it right now uh hu
If everythang failed would run run through the rain, shine, thunderstorms
Would you fuck with the kid where I'm from... Gotta hold my bond, hold my gun
When days get tight and I come in sweaty, Would you kiss all over me with yo tongue
Would you ride for the kid, would you lie for the kid? Death before dis-honor
When I'm on the road doin shows from Mississippi all the way to Hong Kong
And we made the bond that's ways beyond loui vuitton loui vuitton, don't wory bout the money, the money gone come (Racks!)
I just need to know these two questions

Would you ride for yo nigga {Ayee, whatchu lookin for}
That's all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga
That's all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider {watchu lookin for}, a rider, a rider
You might also like
If some things on my mind I need to get off
Can I come to you?
When I need to talk
If I ever get lost, can you help me find my way back to my vault
Would you cherish yo kid like you never had did
Could you love me? Could you love my kids?
Can you be there for me like you never had been
Like any relationship you ever been in
We make a connection that's full of affection
Can you hold me down, Knowin my profession
Will you wait for me patiently, tastefully
Will your loyalty lead to royalty
Can you answer these two questions please

Would you ride for yo nigga
That's all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga
That's all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider

Take you on the town, Baby everythangs on me
First I'm a pick you up in the red rarri
Baby it's yo night you can have whateva you like
Bet you ain't had a bitch that's gone treat you right
Bitch that's gone stay down
Bitch that's gone stay round
Bitch that'll hold dem pounds... If twelve pull up right now
I'm in love witchu
Baby it's the truth
(Moans)
Baby it's the truth
Would you ride for yo nigga (Alright, alright)
That's all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga
That's all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider (Alright, Alright)
That's all I wanna know!4Embed
