10 ContributorsFunny How Time Flies Lyrics
I know what she like, I know what she want, yeah yeah
I know what she like, I know what she want, yeah
I know what she like, I know what she want, yeah yeah
I know what she like, I know what she want

My bitch just like me so I know she wan' stunt
A taste of the good life, yeah, I know what she want
A trip to PR, sex in the car, floating diamonds shabar (woo!)
Call us hood, it's all good, that's what we are (YEAH!)
Find an exotic space to visit, chinchilla, gator-lizid
That's how a nigga gets it when I'm on my shizzit
Bright lights, city life, a nigga so flashy
Have you like "Damn! That Ferrari flew past me!"
So fast a nigga don't know limits
Had a bad bitch in it, I can see it wasn't tinted
Get the money then spend it (yeah), break rules or bend it (yeah)
To my liking, I move like a viking (AOWW!)
A warrior, I shouldn't mean more to you
I'm the American dream, one man regime (uh huh)
Shorty love me like she love new shoes
Insecure, so she investigate me like the Feds, ooh

Funny how time flies (it's funny how time flies) when you're making love (it's funny, it's funny)
It goes on and on and on (it's funny, it's funny), we just can't go wrong (it's funny, it's funny)
Funny how time flies (it's funny how time flies) when you're making love (it's funny, it's funny)
It goes on and on and on (it's funny, it's funny), we just can't go wrong (it's funny, it's funny)
You might also like
They can smile, they can frown, they can love it, they can hate it
They can wish bad shit on us, it's cool, we made it
Look at me to see the Lord's blessings while they stressing
Switch whips, push the Bugatti through the recession (woo!)
It's just me and you, I can see it clear
Police coming, I need you to stash this pistol here
It's all hood, you hesitate they'll put our life on pause (uh huh)
It's a common wealth state, baby, they make up laws
Fuck CMB, it's you and me, baby, we all we got
I say we gon' make it, they saying we not (uh huh)
Yeah, but they don't know I'm meant for you, they don't know how you're into me
They don't know shit about how we bond mentally (AOWW!)
Their relationships are oh so basic
They can't understand how we do and how we say shit
So blunt, don't front, I got you open
It's the original G shit, you know how we get, duck down!

Funny how time flies (it's funny how time flies) when you're making love (it's funny, it's funny)
It goes on and on and on (it's funny, it's funny), we just can't go wrong (it's funny, it's funny)
Funny how time flies (it's funny how time flies) when you're making love (it's funny, it's funny)
It goes on and on and on (it's funny, it's funny), we just can't go wrong (it's funny, it's funny)

50...
You already know what it's about from there, man
Let's get it... I get the bread, man
Watch what I do now
I'ma start taking over construction, gon' start rebuilding the city
Come back, man, 40 projects, nigga
Family day, you already know what that's about, man
It's gon' be crazy, everybody gon' be there
And the rest of y'all niggas that don't show up, ain't nobody anyway
Ha ha ha ha.... YO!
I promise you, man
You ain't never gon' see another nigga like me, man
So you should celebrate me now, 'cause time flies, man
And before you know it, I'll be gone, it's 50...

It goes on and on and on, we just can't go wrong4Embed
