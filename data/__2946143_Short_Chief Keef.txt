14 ContributorsShort Lyrics
I always wanted to be a rich nigga
Thug in me still travel with a stick, nigga
Bolts of the dope, get you fixed, nigga
Pull up in that Jet Li and make it kick niggas
Your bitch in love with a boss
I'm interceptin' her, Randy Moss
Real niggas don't pillow talk
Snitch niggas lifes on chalk

I'm lookin' for the dope man, tell him pull up on me
Ridin' in that Ferrari, actin' fuckin' dorky
Big ass banana clip, actin' fuckin' monkey
The hollows in this .45 are chunky
Black chopper on me but the beam on it so red
Sell a human to a shark and some dope to a coke head
You were runnin' around these streets, nigga, you were so scared
I got all my ice on, Kool-Aid, man, oh yeah
So wavy I can float boats, gettin' off of dope smokes
You fake ass niggas, I can't take this shit no more
I'm down like some Low Pros, cookin' like it's four stoves
Floyd Mayweather, chopper givin' niggas low blow

I always wanted to be a rich nigga
Thug in me still travel with a stick, nigga
Bolts of the dope, get you fixed, nigga
Pull up in that Jet Li and make it kick niggas
Your bitch in love with a boss
I'm interceptin' her, Randy Moss
Real niggas don't pillow talk
Snitch niggas lifes on chalk

Residue up in my nail, weigh that weight up by the scale
Send those packs out through the mail
Send them bags off through the mail
High as hell, so poured a 12, prayin' I don't go to jail
When them bitches fuckin' land, I'ma cop a fucking Lam'
When I'm done with the grams, I might cop a AMG
That's all money goin', bitch, I got a tre on me
And we get 'em by the pint, I'ma pour a 8 at least
And we get 'em by the pint, I'ma pour a 8 at least

I always wanted to be a rich nigga
Thug in me still travel with a stick, nigga
Bolts of the dope, get you fixed, nigga
Pull up in that Jet Li and make it kick niggas
Your bitch in love with a boss
I'm interceptin' her, Randy Moss
Real niggas don't pillow talk
Snitch niggas lifes on chalk1Embed
