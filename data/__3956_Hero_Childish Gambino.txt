Yeah, yes, I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
Yeah, yes, I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop

Cheezy wassup!
Let me hear you holla, bitch
Actor, writer, rapper, nigga, I do all of it
Lactose tolerant; addicted to cheddar
And I spent it on a jacket, man, I don't know no better
Yeah, it's Childish Gambino, yeah I'm fly as a feather
Yeah, my nigga be suburban but my flow keep it ghetto
Keep my swagger Polaroid, you can watch it develop
Ain't it funny? In a year, I went from different to special
Yeah I got it together, yeah, I took those chances
Labels on me like I might cause cancer
Yes a nigga flow went from Camry to Phantom
I'm just talking real shit, hoping you can handle
Sleeping on the jet like "lier" like chandle
Flyer than a jet women, hoping they can land him
How we turn everything to gold that they hand 'em?
I am just different, that's the only answer

Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero, yeah
You might also like
Back on my grind, nigga I'm a skater
She just think I'm fine, nigga you's a hater
Style with no name, they just want to label me
They should call it what these other niggas are afraid to be
APC store walkin' out with eight bags
Yeah I'm killin' paper, call it poppin' tag
You ever spend three grand on designer vision
When you should really spent it on your little sis tuition?
She played my album when nobody else out there would listen
I'm comin' harder than these girls that you would swear were pissin'
Davinci-esque, I'm the real deal
The only thing I don't know is how fake feel
I'm living everything these other niggas lyin' bout
Bitches don't believe me, to prove it to 'em, I fly 'em out
She say that I'm her everything, I'm better than those other guys
I say, "I'm just a rapper" She tell me, "That's a fucking lie"

Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero, yeah
They said me rappin' was like MJ and baseball
But that would make me MJ, so motherfuck all of y'all
Trippin' on this fame shit, drinking like a fuckin fish
Listen to the next track, "I be on that other shit"
Yes I sound weird, nigga, take it as a compliment
Guess who's in the house and representing like a congressman
Anything I put my mind to I accomplish it
From writing scripts with Tina Fey to laying down the hardest shit
Who else is doing what I'm doing? No one
And I mean girls too, intended no pun
I'm on the road son, busy like I'm Bone Thug
Comment left anonymous cause ain't nobody want none
She laying in my bed, she gotta be bi-curious
Barf on the track, be amazing and rap-furious
Damn bloggers argue whether or not I'm serious
It's Nas' Illmatic, not Eddie Murphy's Delirious
Got the limelight, you stupid you think I'm sharing this
Showing up late, promoters wondering where he is
Got some nightmares, but failing's gotta be scariest
But I would never fail, I'm a hero, one of the best there is

Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero
I'm a hero, I'm a hero, yeah6Embed
