8 ContributorsI Came From Nothing 3 Intro Lyrics
Okay, I'm reloading
It's not my voice to tell you to know your place
But thy will show you the space
Wednesday, July 4th, Atlanta, Georgia
75 South, exit T-41, Cleveland Avenue
5000 bricks, 50 bloods, 25 choppers, 10 cooks
5 houses, 3 trucks, 1 Young Thug
You do the math
Rich is for bitches, wealth is for bossesYou might also like1Embed
