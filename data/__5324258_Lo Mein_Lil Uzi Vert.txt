Yeah, chopstick came with a large lo mein
Extra clip in it, nigga, I ain't got no aim
Balmain pocket filled with fresh romaine
And I stay with the cash like a XO chain
Fifty-five hundred, nigga, that's your range
When I go to the club, make it storm, hurricane (Yeah)
Nigga pull up, think he G.I. Joe
Man, 7.62, turn him G.I. Jane

Said Rick Owens boot, they be knee-high, mane
Now when I look down you know I can't see my ankle
Man, she asked for some racks, gave her three times ten
Put her right in the condo, put her in the Benz
And I did all of that, don't wanna see her again
And honestly on to better things, that's her friend
These niggas groupies, they peons, mane
King of my city like Leon, mane
'Head of these niggas by eons, mane
She let me touch for the free-on, mane
So you know that's a must like Elon, mane
They was hatin', I was spendin', you was savin'
Man, I'm countin' up green like a pea pod, mane
I was holdin' down my team like my name was Peyton
Had to make sure my brother good, Eli Manning
Cartiers got diamonds all in the middle
Like a nigga pulled up with three eyes, mane
Just know them shits, they all G.I., mane
Everybody got Rollies, that's two-time frames
I said my side girl tryna be my main
And I said my main girl keep stalkin' my side
I told her, "Shut up and go for a ride" (Skrrt)
In this Rolls-Royce truck
Girl, yeah, you can be on the bus (Yeah)
You can get what you want
Out the mall, no need to hold me up (Woo)
Rickity-racks that's all in my Louis V jeans, double stuffed (Rickity-racks)
I'm turnt to the max, these lil' itty-bitty niggas know it's up

I said it's up, up, up, uppity (Yeah)
Moonwalkin' all on the money (Yeah)
When I moonwalk, my diamonds still sunny (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I moonwalk, I don't need no twenties
When it come to the drip, not in front of me (Woah)
Wearin' Balenciaga on my jacket, my shirt
And my pants, and my socks, and my undies (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Woah, I'm too litty
Yeah, bitch look like Chinese Kitty (Yeah)
1942 in my section, no Remy (Let's go)
Took JT out the city (Yeah)
I can make a ho get way too sticky
Yeah, way, way, way too sticky (Woah)
Hold up, don't you got a whole situation? (Damn)
Livin' my life, too risky (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
How you doin', Uzi? I'm doin' great
I pulled up in the foreign, let's race (Skrrt)
Yes, I stay with some money on me (Money)
Only thing in my pocket, big face (What?)
It's amazing to me how my baby pull up with a fat ass and a skinny waist
It's amazing to me how I spend all this money and I ain't even go in my safe (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's amazing to me how these niggas don't know me but still find a way just to hate (Yeah, yeah)
It's amazing to me how back then she ain't want me but now she wanna go on a date (Yeah)
It's amazing to me how she ask for them racks, told that girl get the fuck out my face (Ha)
It's amazing to me how I'm eatin' so much and I still didn't gain no weight (Woah)
Yeah, chopstick came with a large lo mein
Extra clip in it, nigga, I ain't got no aim
I said, Balmain pocket filled with fresh romaine
