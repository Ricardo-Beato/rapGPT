6 ContributorsKill That Nigga Lyrics
Yo, It's like this man, It's real simple

If my nigga was my nigga like I thought he was
Would he have snitched, hung me out the dry to fuck?
Guess you don't know a nigga 'till you catch a case with 'em
It ain't all gravy just because you make cake with 'em
It's real, niggas scared to death of state prison
To the end when a nigga get caught start snitchin'
Imagine the eyes of a nigga that you knew
For about 20 joints with the nerve to point
Hurt worser than that physical pain
You fetish nigga roll with the sorry fuck, now he switchin' to lame
Niggas in the box could relate to my pain
All I got is my word and I'mma get you thats my word
Through family friends or even fuckin' your bird
Fuck it anything long as your death occur
Whatever happened to death before dishonor?
It's time for your end and it's my honor

(Kill that nigga)
Never wish death, only if I have to, if it's my last option left
(Kill that nigga)
Should've kept your mouth tight he's losin' his life
Be locked up or sending out kites
You might also like
Ay yo this nigga runnin' 'round runnin' his mouth speakin' on the wrong shit
What the fuck is this Dave Letterman shit on the late night
Creep on they talk show ass
Rap asses get shot in they throat, speak on that
Girlie mouth nigga you worse than a bitch
I done shot niggas for you, put my life at risk
How you gonna go behind me and knife my back?
Must be insane and I got a cure for that
My hammer will knock sense in the nigga real quick
Nail a nigga tongue with the four fifth
Nigga you in violation of that code of silence
Niggas like you get real niggas indicted!
We can't have that! Kidnap that bitch!
Torture and torment that snitch!
We gotta make examples out these hummingbird fucks
Matter fact pull 'em out the trunk, I'm bout to
Chorus (repeat 2x)
Never wish death
Kill that nigga (3x)
I'm sendin' out kites
Kill that nigga (4x)2Embed
