22 ContributorsLight Heist Lyrics
Young Chop on the beat
I'm ridin' like a nightlight
So much cash that my pockets look pregnant
They all know I'm knocked up (Ayy, turn the music up for me Chris)
Ridin' like a nightlight, stop at the stoplight
Drove off, ran the red light, there the cops is
Tryna put me into lock up (Otto)
'Member having rocks in my Timbos
Ran off with the coke money (Bang, let's get it, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Pull up, bounce out the all-white thing
(Sosa, baby, GBE, baby)
That there is a snow bunny
Catch up, L's, L's, L's (Sosa on the beat)

In the car, I'm riding, like a nightlight
Ain't gon' stop at the stoplight
I sip Barney, you sip stop sign, yeah, that sounds about right
I wear astronaut clothes
Pull up foreign, beat Kongo
Take three hundred out, Wells Fargo
I don't wait in line, no bar-codes
You see your reflection in my ice
I left you, boy, you not right
My bitch so bad that's it's not nice
Say "Hi", get top, then it's bye-bye
You smokin' on low, boy, you're not high
I keep spinach, like Popeye
Brown bag full of cash, no white rice
All the cash out the bank, that's a light heist
You might also like
Pull up, peeking out the car, no soundproof
Let the MAC out the top, no sunroof
Throwing cash out the top, I'ma bank-teller
Ride the car like I rode the Mongoose
Fill yo' block up 'til it's no more
Hear the SoundClick, no Johnny Juliano
I'm on the high-speed, OJ in the bronco
Got the Yao Ming and Mutombo
I be with Smokey and the bandits
You a cat but you be with the rat pack
Runnin' for the ball, intercept that
If I don't, that's where you get sacked at
Fire too hot like Crisco, pop, pop
I got enough cream for the whole café, no Hard Rock
'Member having rocks in my timbos
Ran off with the coke money
Pull up, bounce out the all-white thing
That there is a snow bunny
Pull up to the show get the forty G's, do that in one hour
What the fuck do I hop in when I leave?
That there is a snow plower

In the car, I'm riding, like a nightlight
Ain't gon' stop at the stoplight
I sip Barney, you sip stop sign, yeah, that sounds about right
I wear astronaut clothes
Pull up foreign, beat Kongo
Take three hundred out, Wells Fargo
I don't wait in line, no bar-codes
You see your reflection in my ice
I left you, boy, you not right
My bitch so bad that's it's not nice
Say "Hi", get top, then it's bye-bye
You smokin' on low, boy, you're not high
I keep spinach, like Popeye
Brown bag full of cash, no white rice
All the cash out the bank, that's a light heist
I'm like sticking a fork in a socket
Get your dumb ass shocked up
So much cash that my pockets look pregnant
They all know I'm knocked up
Had to go change my safety deposit
I told 'em put me in a locker
Drove off, run the red light, there the cops is
Tryna put me into lock-up
Fuck a bitch so good she got me tatted
She wear me like a t-shirt
Got that big boy on my side
I wear heat like a beeper
Came in and Steph Curry'd the game
Can you see me from the bleachers?
Talked to God when I woke up this morning, I asked "can you please keep from the leechers?"
She know I keep cheese, velveet-er
She get a mouth fucked 'til her teeth hurt
I take one ho upstairs, got a bitch right underneath her
I'm an All Star on the bench like Chuck
Throw some money up then the bitch got clucked
Shoot the bitch up and she fizz right up
Gave her some lean then she lit right up

In the car, I'm riding, like a nightlight
Ain't gon' stop at the stoplight
I sip Barney, you sip stop sign, yeah, that sounds about right
I wear astronaut clothes
Pull up foreign, beat Kongo
Take three hundred out, Wells Fargo
I don't wait in line, no bar-codes
You see your reflection in my ice
I left you, boy, you not right
My bitch so bad that's it's not nice
Say "Hi", get top, then it's bye-bye
You smokin' on low, boy, you're not high
I keep spinach, like Popeye
Brown bag full of cash, no white rice
All the cash out the bank, that's a light heist
Let the MAC out the top, no sunroof
Ride the car like I rode the Mongoose
I'm on a high-speed, OJ in the Bronco
I be with Smokey and the Bandits
You a cat but you be with the Rat Pack
Fire too high, like Crisco, pop pop
I got enough cream for the café, no Hard Rock3Embed
