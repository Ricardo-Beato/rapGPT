Club swole, club swole
Come on, fuckin turn up
These bitch ass motherfuckers
Yea slam me down right here
From the front to the back
Yea yea right in the front man, bout the dope fuck nigga
Gucci
What a waste
The way she sittin round that motherfucker man
A hundred of these motherfuckers
Parked up
Club swole, club packed right by the wall
Yea I'm on
Guwop swat Guwop Guwop Guwop

Club swole, it full of hoes
This AP here -- it's solid gold
How much it cost for one of those?
It cost yo AP and 90 more
I upper her cameltoe like ready Bowe
This Rollie's locked tight on my wrist just like the figure 4
Got a Bentley outside with the 4's on
Got a ho inside, no clothes on
I'm going rose gold all summer long
I'mma keep the top back til the summer gone
Got a dark skinned bitch in my Rari
Rodeo Drive, it's a shopping spree
Can somebody please bring a incense?
Got look smelling just like cookie
On a jet, get head and pussy
Tryna roll 3-5 in a Phily
Nigga let me tell you a quick story about me
Shoot you in a knee now you got one good knee
'Wop!

Club swole, club swole
These glasses that I'm wearing can't see nothing but hoes
She smoking with me and drinkin with me
My jewelry jury dripping & it got her pussy dripping
Club swole, club swole
I'm in my two seater so this car here's only for hoes
I told her hold it for me and roll it for me
And if I need you to baby then pour it for me

My jewelry drippin, Longway fly cripping
She hit the spot, seen quick flip pussy start drippin
I'm at this Kwik Trip serving gas, my zip's 2-50
This 2 door man it's mighty fast, on a dash it's 2-20
A cold march, I can form a 20
Country boys on the roll, 1-20
Take a 9 out a brick, remix it
Overnight, west coast, we ship em
Meet him at the dock  (??)
Piped up Christie Loui with the skippers
Tied up just all over the skittles
Looking at my jewels wear Big Dipper
2 bitches want me, jack trippa
Sprinkle sprinkle, molly LongWay dick em
Lean by the Pint LongWay sippin
Ball man, I'm about it, young rich nigga
They say that nigga iluminati, countin up figures
Got niggas all around me, got they hands on the trigger
Slumdog millionaire come out them trenches
Ought to get shot flickin
Club swole, filled up with bad ass bitches
No offense, you know I stash it in my jimmy true vision
LongWay!
Club swole, club swole
These glasses that I'm wearing can't see nothing but hoes
She smoking with me and drinkin with me
My jewelry dripping & it got her pussy dripping
Club swole, club swole
I'm in my two seater so this car here's only for hoes
I told her hold it for me and roll it for me
And if I need you to baby then pour it for me

See in reality I don't know this bad bitch nationality
No sympathy, I pulled up with his bitch, that was a tragedy
Catastrophe, every time we pull up in that masterpiece
The backseat got her on her knees, sayin your majesty
I'm talkin levity's, bitch you sit em star, these are Givenchy
Bali me, spent 100K just on accessory
100 deep, fuck around, we bought out all the VIP
No Ciroc for me, LongWay in here pourin up all that lean lean lean
1017, XVL, & MPA got pounds of weed
This jewelry, I can't help yo ho wanna fuck this ice on me
Designer frame, I'm doin me, I got yo ho on aquafi
She gon let me fuck for free
Met her at the Double Tree
(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
Club swole, club swole
These glasses that I'm wearing can't see nothing but hoes
She smoking with me and drinkin with me
My jewelry dripping & it got her pussy dripping
Club swole, club swole
I'm in my two seater so this car here's only for hoes
I told her hold it for me and roll it for me
And if I need you to baby then pour it for me1Embed
