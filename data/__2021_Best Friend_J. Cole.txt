I see your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that?
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
Then what she do? Double back
Now I know we far from perfect
But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that?
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you’ll call her back

My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone
Telling how her man dogging me
My best friend say, don't tell her nothing 'bout me and you
'Cause she ain't showing me no sympathy
My best friend say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go
Home a long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
I’ll be there, I’ll still be there for you

In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
You might also like
Now, now, now, now, know we be arguing
But ain't you riding with me?
We breaking, up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I’ll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, then you start listening
To friends, and then it gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky’s
That they sent me, is that real love
You’re the only one that I will love
Damn, damn

My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
My best friend says
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
My best friend says
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend says, my best friend says
I’ll still be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you

Girl I can see it in your eyes
How you feeling? Let me know what's on your mind
We’ve been together for a long long time
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes
I know to you it feel like I’m never around
Round, round, round
But if you leave me then who else gon hold me down?
Hey, hey, hey4Embed
