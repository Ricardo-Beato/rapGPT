4 ContributorsMoet Lyrics
Bitches, bitches, bitches, you love moet
Bring some of that shit, bring it to me
Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, I love moet
Everybody in this place love moet

Flossy bitches in leathers
Smellin' like Prada, shakin' their tailfeathers
I hit the event with the hydro glow
Never party pooper, super rhyme pro
I can feel hatred when I step through the door
Why you talkin' bout me? You best watch your ho'
'Cause she is watchin' me, I'm watchin' her watch me
She clockin' the Versace, eyes locked to the crotchy
I move to her, pimpin', step it up a notchy
The 'Zine play vivid, like a fifty-inch Hitachi
With a body like a bottle, is your name Jeannie?
You need to be with me, why you chillin' with that weenie?
Fool get mad, like he gon' throw a fit
Nigga, don't you know the Glock ready to spit?
Lord have his mercy, get this, nitwit
It's nasty in the gutter, don't make the Glock spit

Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
You might also like
Let's get it poppin', homie, pour some more in my cup
Man, the way this bass bangin', I'm buzzed, ready to fuck
I'm tryna get my duck sucked, let her massage these nuts
Like the Bishop say (Step your game up)
We them niggas that they wanna hang with and do they thing with
Don't mind me, just vibe off this gangster shit
Hootie-hoo in the house gon' get some
Feelin' good 'cause she wet, but we tryin' to get her more wet

Pour it 'til it's all gone, you might get the suds
When you sip it, make sure you finish, then you get a buzz
We don't love not one of you's, hope you soak it up
Understand how we do it, cashin' in and gettin' sucked up
For real, we don't play, takin' breaks when we can
Hit the glow like the strobe, puttin' bitches in a jam
Then scram, we on to the next destination
Pimpin's how we do it, puttin bitches in their places!

It's up to you, player
To make sure them bottles multiply, but not out your pocket
Dig, it's the new Mack-illennium now
And chicks not gonna get away with that game no more
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it

Drunk as fuck, but still sippin', I'm stuck in this position
Where the rest of all my niggas I came up in here with?
Talk to the bitches like I won't, I'm tryin' to roll a blunt
Ain't got no time to sit and holler, come swallow me or somethin'
Since tomorrow wasn't promised, I'ma party 'til I die
Big glass of Moet, share with my niggas in the sky
Tipsy on a fifth, I'm gettin' frisky with a bitch
Oh, yeah, I used to hit her sister, but that was in '96
Leave a tip with the bartender
You little slender, fine ho', I'm comin' home with you
Get more explicit, baby, touchin' on my dick, I'm rushin' to get a fix
Another shot'll set us off, it cost to get with this
I'm just a hop and a skip around the way from where I say
I put my dick back in my pants and I'm finished for the day
I ain't sayin' it no more, the glass'll get it poppin'
Ass is what I'm lookin' for, she got it, got it

Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we got forty hoes in here, so we gon' need about
You know, let me see how many bottles we gon' need
Let me add this shit up real quick
Give me one second, hold on, let me see
Okay, all right, here we go, look

Ten times five, plus four, minus three
Bitches'll bring bottles, and they all for free
I go hard on 'em, guard on 'em, pourin' my glass
I want the little yellow bitch with the big old ass
My young homeboy shot some drag, then he put out a bag
Now she drinkin' and she thinkin' that she gon' get some cash
Look, fill it up one more 'gain, get that shit crack-a-lackin'
Tell her to back it up, suck a nigga, like Dracula
And now she feelin' good, I'm feelin' good, it's so spectacular
This ain't no actin' here, but you'll be actin' up
Laughin' and crackin' up, talkin' to your peoples 'bout
How it rolls, you call it Mimosa, let's toast to
The hood life, the good life
You could, might be livin' the good life if you do it right, do it right

When you see a player chargin' a chick
Dig, player, pat him on the back
Don't player-hate, congratulate

Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it

Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you dig it?
Moesha crept up on her ass, now she can feel it
Laid up naked with six bitches and twelve titties
Alright, ladies, I want asses wigglin' and titties jigglin'
Oh, you did it

I got a whole glass full, I'm feelin' cool, no bullshit
Moet up in my cup, Jack, I'm chillin' with a rugrat
Sexy legs and hips, I'm you bitch (Uh-huh)
I got game, like Suga Free, up in Cologna, bitch

Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know it
Yeah, we just sippin' on some moet
To get the hoes more wet, you hoes better know itEmbed
