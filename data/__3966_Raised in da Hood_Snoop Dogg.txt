11 ContributorsRaised in da Hood Lyrics(I was raised in the hood)
Eastside Long Beach to be exact
(I was raised in the hood)
Where the grass is greener and the Crips are much meaner
(We got your back, I was raised in the hood)
I’ll never turn my back on the hood
Yeah you can take me out the hood
But you can’t take the hood up outta me

Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the 20s
Yeah I’m stealing niggas, please what you know bout that
I do it everytime, told em 1800 had em mixing it with lime (oh weee)
My life is like a movie, I was thuggin in the beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi
Bitch, choose me, cause I’m going to the top
Rap or the rock, them hoes say I’m on bitch
Whenever will it stop
I was poppin’like it’s on, slamming Chevy’s up the block
East up, what it do though
Now I ride 2-door, the Porsche looking mean
Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood

I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back

Raised by the monsters the criminals
The G’s, it was the niggas on the East
What you know bout that?
Snoopy in his prime, I’m a boss
I catch a nigga slippin’ like moss
Ride with the realest , I’ve been on it since a young’n
It’s 200 bitches in the function
Looking cool, you know it bitchy I’m rollin’
And I ain't worried bout them niggas we patrolling the hood and the city
Rollin on that dilly
2 milli, 2 Bugatti’s, call em Rozay and Diddy
Heart of the set, homie I’m a vet
Lil nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around
I’m a rep, East up, what it do though
Hoes spillin’ Nuvo, Doggy on his tip
I threw up the two O
Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood

I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back
Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block
It was plenty of them niggas on the spot
What you know bout that?
Turned up fully
The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig?
Burnt out and any party we at, you know it’s turned out
The people talking the rumours
Now what you heard about?
How I spend 100 thou gettin’ purped out
I’m strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up
They know I’m famous, like I won’t get in the streets Cuz?
Like I don’t come from the W, I’m a beast bru
What it do though, dickies for the dulo
Homie, you know skinny niggas sumo
Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hoodEmbed
