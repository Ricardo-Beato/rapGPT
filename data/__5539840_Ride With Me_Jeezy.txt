4 ContributorsRide With Me Lyrics
For any nigga  with ya
 with ya
Act like  with ya
 with me
In the club act a fool with me
 ride 
 wanna ride with me
 with ya
Get high with ya
Vibe with ya
 down to ride 

I said I ain't got time, for bitches or these bitch niggas
You hating ass hoes, or you snitch niggas
Man I sware this type of shit happens everyday
That's why I buy a new chopper 
So really, fuck what a nigga say
If you ain't making shit, fuck what a nigga pay
 fuck a nigga 
If you ain't a fuck nigga, fuck you anyway
Niggas lying, but they really want my street cred
I ain't feeding nobody, that's what the streets said
Everybody wanna eat, but don't nobody want to 
 I be dambed if 
You niggas pull up with  I'm bout to say the grace
Why tell it to the street when you can tell it to my face?
I learned it from 
You might also like
For any nigga  with ya
 with ya
Act like  with ya
 with me
In the club act a fool with me
 ride 
 wanna ride with me
 with ya
Get high with ya
Vibe with ya
 down to ride 

Back in the day, before rapping, nigga I selling crack in the day
 matching 
 sack of the yay
And you friendly ass niggas must think you can get on
No, get the fuck off
 let in my house
There's a chance that one of them niggas is ratting me out
And I don't need no new friends
If you can't take care of yourself, nigga you ain't no man
Just cause I know a nigga, doesn't mean I oah a nigga
Always begging, never do shit for a nigga
You probably come for the free liquor
Cause you always smoke  but I never see you 
You ain't never got 
 never got a slut
For any nigga  with ya
 with ya
Act like  with ya
 with me
In the club act a fool with me
 ride 
 wanna ride with me
 with ya
Get high with ya
Vibe with ya
 down to ride 

 solo creep
One deep in these streets, I been known to rome
Don't fuck with homes, Imma stand alone
I was tought this game, so I must do nothing, I don't cross with lames
I'm a hood nigga, so I think like one
To make sure I'm around, so I can teach my son
But your homeboy look like when your face 
 fucked off 
And the lawyer you was cool with won't take that case
Even though you payed for his tuition, he forgot that day
But hey, live and you learn
Never  teach a lesson to a nigga 
For any nigga  with ya
 with ya
Act like  with ya
 with me
In the club act a fool with me
 ride 
 wanna ride with me
 with ya
Get high with ya
Vibe with ya
 down to ride Embed
