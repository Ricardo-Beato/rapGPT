9 ContributorsForever (Original) Lyrics
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

Shit, nigga, this what I does
I sware I ain't lyon, like this is my cubs
This is my tub, and I'm dirty in the summer, bitch
Weezy F Baby, and I lookin like I does some shit
You ain't know nothin bitch, you better know who you fuckin with
Try to fuck me, I kill you, and who you comin with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on the high heels, but I am no Boosie
Hollands Avenue, ridin; with the roof gone
On the Mayback, 2 tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24's, boy, what you on
I'm richer than a bitch without the gray coupon
I'm talkin' out of my head, I make a blue eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a Blood, motherfucker, a Blood, motherfucker
Forever, like ETC period, motherfucker
You might also like
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

I'm so unsigned, it would blow one's mind
Cause every single record I am so unkind
There is no holes bard, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know rugs cost
So PAY UP, I don't think you will ever find another nigga like me
Never LIE, I got everything I tell them I got
This young nigga show boat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Who else tryna' smoke, yeah nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the Pressure, that's what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a Ski-do
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down, hoe, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm going in, like a life sentence
And understand, I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that, 10 4
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man

Kidd Kidd!
Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger, I can't deal with this shit, uh
You say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch, I'm back on my shit, like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly (ha)
Like Pooky, take a Dooky on a rap producer, loose leaf
Throw his trash ass out the window like Lukey
To a shark, you just sushi
You ain't hard, you coochie
Wally Oochie, soft as newborn booty
I say I'm movin slow, I'm just thinkin fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, about to lap your ass
And nigga, I don't rest, I'm up, till my times up
I be the tech chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't chorus lines, nigga, your choruses lyon
Cause the only point you ever gained, was a one
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, manEmbed
