(Cough)
Fuck... Yo, I gotta stop smoking Backwoods

How you doing? And what's your motive, ho?
I only trust these bitches 'bout as far as I can throw 'em
Trying to pay my mama rent, figure that's just what I owe her
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller
Strolling easy down this narrow path, beefing with your scary ass
'Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad
And nigga, that's a great lunch
Papa Swamp be stomping with the skate fucks
Heavy-handing tracks until the day the fucking train come
Raised up where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut
Peep the evening news, my niggaâ€”we don't do the same stuff
Kiwis couldn't take us, boy, I'm jogging around these bases
Niggas' pitches need to change, I separated from my main one
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face-fuck
I been like this since the Motorola Razr
What a bastard that baby was
Little mad nigga missing dad, never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a nigga's seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga Da$h with me, he sipping on some maple leaf
I'm only happy when there's static in the air 'cause the fairweather fake to me
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never bitches funny, boy
You berries and you honey for the bear that's here to tear and eat
Run a nigga's pockets like some errands, make it hasty
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
Hope the sheriff keep away from meYou might also like34Embed
