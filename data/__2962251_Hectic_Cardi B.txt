KSR
Cardi
Hardwerk

Ayo, step up in the spot, you know who I be
Couple bottles pop in the VIP
Dancin' all up on the couch, shakin' my ass
Probably leave with ya man, grand larceny
Bitch, pardon me, you don't wanna start with me
I be out here gettin' cash, you be on the thottery
I be in the trap, chasin' chips like the lottery
You ain't bout that life, you don't be like Cardi B
All my gettin'-shmoney hoes, throw ya hands up
Yeah, you cute but you gon' have to pull ya pants up, yeah
I see you over there checkin' out my thick thighs, tetas
See, I gotta smart mouth and what?
Keep it litty for my city, NYC
Take the whole nut, ain't worried 'bout no Plan B
Yeah, I'm nasty, lick my lips, blow a kiss
And walk off with a hunnid thou' on my wrist
Swish, I ain't with the politics
"A hoe never gets cold," you know what the motto is
Unless it's baguettes diamond cuts, gold bottles, bitch
Sittin' in that 6, frostbit, feelin' hella lit
You might also like
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry 'bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slayin' shit, I'm in the best fit
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry 'bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slayin' shit, I'm in the best fit

NY, do or die, yeah, I got this
KSR, chill y'all, yeah, I got this
40 those, 2 seater in the cockpit
And I'm a freak so you know that bitch topless
You a hot mess, that's a fact though
Understood the life, bitch, you know how that go
A lot of thots out here plottin' on my cash flow
But I'm a queen just tryna build the castle
You a fiend, you all up in my asshole
I cause a scene and give you what you ask for
Hair did, manicure, so ready, check
Attitude have to be so petty, yep
I'm in it this year, a minute to spare, I swear
My vision is clear, y'all bitches beware, I'm here
Showstopper, Ms. Life of the party, yeah
Top shotta, no filter, Young Cardi, yeah
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry 'bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slayin' shit, I'm in the best fit
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry 'bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slayin' shit, I'm in the best fit5Embed
