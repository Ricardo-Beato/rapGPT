3 ContributorsGang Bangin Lyrics
Brick Squad Monopoly, 1017, The Commission
They say we're a product of our environment
Be sure to eat out here, nigga
Let's go!

They say a nigga name ringin'
Ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
Brick Squad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
*Silenced gunshots*

They say my face is hot again, somebody got shot again
Pray and plot, I strategize, Brick Squad boys we gotta win
First in ten, I'm going in, the verdict, I did it again
I'm throwin' bricks back at the pen, went n' got out I'm worried 'bout ten
Boosie in and Gucci out, barely by a long shot
Been down there in my pocket now
All these whores be jockin' now
Red down, bread down, man down, stand down
East Atlanta my town, I'm the mayor, hands down
Got everybody flagged up, ragged up, salute me or shoot me
Recruit me, you can't 'cause I'm Gucci
Thirty six, I'm going in, some folks I don't see checkin' in
Shout out to my nigga then, in the pen, I'm goin' in
You might also like
They say a nigga name ringin', ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
Brick Squad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
They say a nigga name ringin'
Ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
Brick Squad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'

Red diamonds, same color as plasma, look at me on your plasma
Same nigga from the duece to the plasma
Same nigga from the four to the 
Brick Squad, paper getter, real Goodfellas
Screamin' out, "Free Duece," he named after the block
It's only right he make it pop, close your mouth P Screw
JJ roll one, think I need a cold one, streets might tear me down
At least I be drunk and high, at least I'll be fuckin' fly
Me and Gucci smoking, I might touch the sky
A tat, the only tear that's under my eye
All this pain inside, can't even cry
Just fuckin' ride, damn

They say a nigga name ringin', ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
Brick Squad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
They say a nigga name ringin'
Ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
Brick Squad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
Brick Squad!
They say a nigga name ringin'
Ain't that sad if my lil man grow up gang bangin', I can't be mad
What am I to fuckin' do? Raise my child to be a chump?
Daddy never ran from beef, (Holiday season) this fuckin' heat cocked up
My hood full of gunners who protect me when I'm yawnin'
I know people who will kill you for a bag of marijuana
I'm not a murderer, but I'll get ya murdered bruh
Brick Squad militant, no casualties, I'm trained for war
Ready push the duece line, squad tatted on my neck and chest
My CEO bang, nigga, Gucci two times
A lot of dead homies, but wonder when your homie died
The realest shit I ever wrote, I'm not an easy homicide

They say a nigga name ringin', ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
Brick Squad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
They say a nigga name ringin'
Ain't that sad that my lil boy grew up gang bangin'
I couldn't be mad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'
Brick Squad, Brick Squad, yeah we bang bangin'Embed
