The reason why black people are so addicted to materialism is, we use materialism to vicariously add wealth to ourselves
In other words, I don't think much of me. I ain't nobody. But if I put these Air Jordans on, I will be
If I buy this house in a white suburb, I will be. You understand? If I get this white woman, I will be
If I get this Louis Vuitton bag, I will be. So, we use wealth to replace self-worth

'Kay, some may think I'm insane. Just a sprinkle of brain
I'm on the brink of a change. Clearly the underdog, but the dude is winning
I'm onto new beginnings. Race and just choose your engine
And living confused with sinning
I done got some problems. Trying to save this Gotham
Niggas robbing and killing, but it's up to me to stop them
But it drives me insane. Niggas grimy and slimy
So find me a change. I'd rather buy me a Range
But I've been removed from popping tags. I'd rather cop a Jag
Damn, can't stop the swag. Open gates, lock 'em back
Got us all in prison. Income from writtens
Flow is so persistent, but the fame got me tripping
I done moved past the shoes, bags, the waves and do' rags
Your wave is due past. It's over, was too dragged
Never on a newcast in cars that move fast
Save up, don't lose cash to working for two sacks

'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting
'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting
You might also like
I dreamed of earning mega millions, least a hundred or two
Penthouse apartment with just a wonderful view
Cameras flashing, paparazzi always front of the news
Gold chains and lots of Jordans, I'll have bundles to choose
I want diamonds and watches and straight shining on carpet
And my Bugatti, I park it. Issey Miyake my closet
And this money that I'm making, I'm gon' show it off
Odd are, couple years, I'm gon' blow it all
Can't resist the urge to spend. My problems are worsening
I'm going to church to sin. Please close the curtaining
Your whole life's been open, explain the pipe you're smoking
Plus, like the pills you're popping, the way to deal has got 'em
Straight up going insane. It ain't flowing the same
It seems like y'all start to change with the hoes and the fame
'Cause a nigga got some dollars, gotta change up my homies
Straight become a new person, while forgetting the old me

'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting
'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting
Fuck family, fuck friends. All I want is designer
Fuck a peace of mind and conscience with my leather recliner
Fuck attention and a Grammy, all I want is the dollars
Fuck being a role model, all I want is the sponsors
Sad that I sold my soul for money, the hoes and gold
I'm stressed and blowing dope because the Holy Ghost
Made the wrong decision, like the longest living
But got the strongest vision, clouded by thongs on women
But I know all these vices. Gotta stay enlightened
With the fame, I won't change. I'mma beat it, I'mma fight it
Blowing up the first year, talking 'bout the birth year
Becoming what I hate, a false prophet, that's my worst fear

'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting
'Cause we all about the guala. Trying to get the dollars
Designer clothes, lot of hoes, Gucci collar
Never been fronting. All come from nothing
Getting them checks, you expect I'm stunting

Nigga, you just wait 'til I come up, nigga
Y'all- Y'all think I'm playing, like it's a joke or something?
When you see me come around in that Bentley truck and I'm fucking shit up
You're gonna want to ride with me
When you see me step out the car, huh, but let's see how I could run this
Huh, $500 on my ass
Huh, 700 on my feet
Uh, these niggas is cheap
I'm talking V.V.S. down to the motherfucking toe
I'm talking 'bout motherfucking 6 karat for the pinky ring, nigga1Embed
