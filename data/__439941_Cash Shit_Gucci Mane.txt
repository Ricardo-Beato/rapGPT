10 ContributorsCash Shit Lyrics
Ice Cream Man Gucci
Brick Squad's finest

I got a trap house, time to check my crack house
I got a lean house, I got a stash house
It's right next to my juug house
My baby mama moved out
My ex-girl kicked me out
I still pass bricks out
Zone 6, I got my middle finger up, screamin' fuck a hater
I put my money on a motherfuckin' escalator
And I'm up like I'm in a fuckin' elevator
Sixes on my Charger, sittin' like a skyscraper
Hi hater! Wave at ya as I fly by
I'mma fly ass nigga since the junior high
You a lie, say you see me in some Levi's
Got these number nine J's and I'm too live
Going down in this motherfucker
I'm a rich motherfucker, I don't wear Chuckers
I don't do num-chuks, got a 40 Cal
I'm in the Louis Vuitton store signing autographs
It's Guwop

I'm talking cash shit, I'm talking cash shit
They say I'm feeling myself, feeling myself, feeling myself, bitch
I'm talking cash shit, I'm talking cash shit
They say I'm feeling myself, feeling myself, feeling myself
I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah, I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah
Say I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah
Guwop
You might also like
I'm a millionaire, got millionaire friends
And a millionaire Benz, I'm a millionaire trend
Million dollar mansion nigga, Gucci Man going in
Million dollar haircut, million dollar grin
When I walk in - you can hear the wind
Blowin' money in the wind, screamin' fuck a friend
Found a pen, Rumpelstiltskin
You don't like Gucci? Fuck your opinion
A bad bitch in lingerie playing pig skin
I'm 4th and and long and you niggas 3rd and inches
I still can, make a Saturday outta Wednesday
Black cat pulled up, she superstitious
It's Gucci

I'm talking cash shit, I'm talking cash shit
They say I'm feeling myself, feeling myself, feeling myself, bitch
I'm talking cash shit, I'm talking cash shit
They say I'm feeling myself, feeling myself, feeling myself
I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah, I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah
Say I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah
