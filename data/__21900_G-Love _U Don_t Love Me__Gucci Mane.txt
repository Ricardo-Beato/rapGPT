4 ContributorsG-Love (U Donâ€™t Love Me) Lyrics & (Gucci Mane)
And you want me to give you all of my hugs, all of my love
But you don't love me (YEAHHH!)
And you keep on sayin that's how you are, but that ain't good enough
Cause you don't love me (GUCCI~!)
And you want me to think that we're gonna pass
So I keep comin back (LeToya Luckett, what's happenin baby?)
You say it might be, but baby that ain't gon' be good enough
(It's Gucci baby) So there ain't no us, cause you don't love me

I'm a Zone 6 nigga, so it ain't nuttin to it
Your man won't beat it up, well guess what I'll do it!
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll beat that thang like I'm performin
You hate me now but bet that you gon' love me in the mornin (YEAHHH)
Flash flood warnin, I'm in the club stormin (go, go, go, go)
Girls choosin shawty better come and get'cha toyfriend
High than a Martian around the Wheel of Fortune (it's Gucci)
You my Vanna White and even Ray Charles think you gorgeous (well DAMN~!)
The way you put it down, you remind me of my Porsche (wow)
And I'm not bein arrogant I'm just tryin be cautious (wow)
I'm so scared of commitment it make me nauseous (ewwww)
I don't love ya girl but I still think ya gorgeous (YEAHHH)
G-love, baby all I give
Cause you done fell in love with a real street nigga
G-love, baby all I give ya
Cause you done fell in love with a real street nigga (it's Gucci!)
You might also like
And you want me to give you all of my hugs, all of my love
But you don't love me
And you keep on sayin that's how you are, but that ain't good enough
Cause you don't love me
And you want me to think that we're gonna pass
So I keep comin back, you say it might be
But baby that ain't gon' be good enough
So there ain't no us, cause you don't love me

One day you gon' find me and then want to rehire me
Find some other guy friend that meet all your requirments (stop)
I can even lie, them a dime, you a diamond (bling! bling! bling!)
And if I linked up to ya, you'd give them the Heisman
Rubbin on ya thighs and I'm lookin in ya eyes and
It's hard to decide man, love's so hard to find man
Gucci not a blind man but Gucci still a bachelor
Give me all the substance, give him all the extra
Gucci man I bless ya, love to caress ya
One thing I'll never do, put you under pressure
Gucci man done bless ya, I love to caress ya
One thing I would never do is put you under pressure
G-love, baby all I give
Cause you done fell in love with a real street nigga
G-love, baby all I give ya
Cause you done fell in love with a real street nigga Gucci!
And you want me to give you all of my hugs, all of my love
But you don't love me
And you keep on sayin that's how you are, but that ain't good enough
Cause you don't love me
And you want me to think that we're gonna pass
So I keep comin back, you say it might be
But baby that ain't gon' be good enough
So there ain't no us, cause you don't love me

G-love, baby all I give
Cause you done fell in love with a real street nigga
G-love, baby all I give ya
Cause you done fell in love with a real street nigga Gucci!

Baby tell me why...
Why you don't love me
Why you don't love me
Oh nooo...2Embed
