I smoke kush I dont fuck with regular
Versace shop, they know me I'm a regular
I order 50 bottles on the regular
All my bitches bad, I don't fuck with regulars
I walk in Magic City on the regular
I fuck with king of diamonds on the regular
All my cars exotic, I don't ride them regulars
Zone six im in the hood on the regular

Gucci mane you know I gotta et cetera
I smoke purp I dont fuck with regular
All my bitches bad none of my hoes are regular
Big rims yeah my rims irregular
Diarrhea flow im shitting on my competetors
I got a car yeah bluer than an avatar
Smoking kush and they brought it in a glass jaw
My car so fresh it should be put in nascar
Im a gangsta and I get that from my grandpa
Im darkskin so what the fuck I need a tam for
She high as hell man I think she on a zambar
I like to bal lout why I bought them pants for

I smoke kush I dont fuck with regular
Versace shop, they know me I'm a regular
I order 50 bottles on the regular
All my bitches bad, I don't fuck with regulars
I walk in Magic City on the regular
I fuck with king of diamonds on the regular
All my cars exotic, I don't ride them regulars
Zone six im in the hood on the regular
You might also like
Bad bitches yeah I fit them in my schedule
Yeah them bitches bad none of them girls are regular
Im in the club 100 bottles in my section 
You just a regular im just being technical
Call me regular all my chains regular
Diamonds so bright you would think im a movie star
She love to handle business while she a professional
The way she suck me up I swear shes a perfectionist
I got a hundred bricks they coming up from Mexico
I made a hundred thousand dollars at the Texaco
She said she want to be a singer, I said she's the next to blow
I dug her out but you pulled her on a pedal stool

I smoke kush I dont fuck with regular
Versace shop, they know me I'm a regular
I order 50 bottles on the regular
All my bitches bad, I don't fuck with regulars
I walk in Magic City on the regular
I fuck with king of diamonds on the regular
All my cars exotic, I don't ride them regulars
Zone six im in the hood on the regularEmbed
