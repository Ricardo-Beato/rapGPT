(Wheezy Beats)
Yeah, yeah
Nigga, what?
Yeah, ayy, yeah

I know all my whips are foreign, I know all your bitches borin'
I know I gained me some weight when I was tourin'
Fresh and clean like a newborn, I wet that bitch and then wet yours
I ride that beat with no insurance (What you tell 'em, Thugger?)

Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid (Woo)
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid (Skrrt)
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid (Whoa)

Ooh, she bad, damn, she bad, yeah, she bad, yeah
Michael Jackson (Jackson), Freddy Jackson check my jacket, yeah
Balmain jeans (Fresh), extended tee, that my swag, yeah
Bad bitch (Swag), know I'm loaded, so they taxing, yeah
Write it off (Sheesh), hold it (Hold up, hold up)
Make her come back like she owe me (Then what?), she know it
I tapped on that ass and she turn around and show it, oh Lord (Ah)
Moved down to Miami now she think she's Zoeing (What?)
They know her (What else?), they taught her, they showed her (Woo)
Fresh as a peppermint (I'm clean), grease 'em like sandwiches (Ooh)
Almost couldn't handle it (Whoa, whoa), I don't establish it (No)
Popping these Xannies, these Perkies, I'm dranking that lean, and I'm smoking that good (Sheesh)
Told that lil' bitch I want to see her topless just like a hood (Sheesh)
