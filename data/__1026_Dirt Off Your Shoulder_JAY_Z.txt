107 ContributorsDirt Off Your Shoulder Lyrics

You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin' greatest!
(Ugh, ugh, uh-huh-uh-huh, ugh)
(Jigga, uh-huh-uh, uh-uh)
Turn the music up in the headphones (Jigga)
(Uh-huh-uh, Jigga, uh-uh, uh-uh, ugh)
Tim, you can go on and brush your shoulders off, nigga
I got you
(Ugh, ch-ch, ugh, ugh, Jigga)
Ugh, yeah

If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go on—brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps, too; go on—brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby; don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, prolly be locked by the force
Tryna hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said, the ladies, they love me — from the bleachers, they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin' — they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers — they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom to the "Top of the Pops"
Nigga, London (Woo), Japan (Woo), and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back — get it, man? I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc
You might also like
If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go on — brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps, too; go on — brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby; don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder

Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryna get me a Rover (Woo)
Tryna stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the heckler close — you know them smokers'll test you
But, like, 52 cards went out — I'm through dealin'
Now, 52 bars come out — now, you feel 'em
Now, 52 cars roll out; remove ceiling in case 52 broads come out
Now, you chillin' with a boss, bitch, of course; "S.C." on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans (Woo), plus, the slippers is clean (Woo)
No chrome on the wheels (Woo), I'm a grown-up for real, chyeah!

If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go on — brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps, too; go on — brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby; don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest that run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em — niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive — nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammys
From O's to opposite Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie; you a customer, crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder — could you brush it off for me?

If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go on — brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps, too; go on — brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby; don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (Get) that (That) dirt off your shoulder

You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin' greatest!
