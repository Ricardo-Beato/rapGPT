12 ContributorsOpponent Lyrics
Zaytoven
Ayy, ayy
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, ayy

She's a very bad bitch, I saw her on the corner
That ain't my bitch, I just wanna fuck her mama
Xbox shit, I'm the only one
And they scream, "That's my shit," every time they cut me on it
Came in the trap, on the floor goes the money
Ho bust a loud pack and I put a lighter on it
How my doors flap, I be thinking I'm a hornet
Where he at? I'm gon' have to kill my opponent

You said I ain't getting money, what you talking 'bout?
I remember, used to live at my mom's house
Now I'm living large, got a nice house
In the mansion, man, I had to get the mice out
Tell her, "Baby girl, who told you bring my pipe out?"
This bitch tripping 'cause I cut the lights out
She cooking chickens in my shit ,got the rice out
Thirty-five for a show, tell 'em right now
When I went up in the club, have my ice out
I'm blinging and they got the fucking lights out
Call Desperado for the chrome
He put the auto to your dome
Call Cabo for a caper, he like, "Right now?"
I'm like, "Right now, this nigga got his ice out"
Me and JusGlo riding strong
We'll have you waiting thirty hours long
You might also like
She's a very bad bitch, I saw her on the corner
That ain't my bitch, I just wanna fuck her mama
Xbox shit, I'm the only one
And they scream, "That's my shit," every time they cut me on it
Came in the trap, on the floor goes the money
Ho bust a loud pack and I put a lighter on it
How my doors flap, I be thinking I'm a hornet
Where he at? I'm gon' have to kill my opponent

You got a very freaky mama, we can do a slumber
She asked for my number, gave her the jack, lumber
Rolling in the uh-huh, they like, "There go Obama"
Rolling of that uh-uh, bitch, I can't even mumble
This bitch trippin' off of nothin', told that bitch stumble
I'ma get this money, you'll see how the cookie crumble
Go and fall, bitch, I won't be there to catch you
Go and sneeze, bitch, ain't gon' be there to bless you
Twenty grand my i8 can beat your Tesla
Foreign came ready, I'm like, "I just have to test it"
Bitch, so what? Look like I'm riding in a vessel
I saw that motherfucker and I'm like, "I gotta get 'em"

She's a very bad bitch, I saw her on the corner
That ain't my bitch, I just wanna fuck her mama
Xbox shit, I'm the only one
And they scream, "That's my shit," every time they cut me on it
Came in the trap, on the floor goes the money
Ho bust a loud pack and I put a lighter on it
How my doors flap, I be thinking I'm a hornet
Where he at? I'm gon' have to kill my opponent
Kill my opponent, kill my opponent
Where he at? I'm gon' have to kill my opponent
Kill my opponent, kill my opponent
Where he at? I'm gon' have to kill my opponent
I'ma do his flap, think that I'm haunted
I'ma do his flap, think, shit, I'm haunted
I'ma do his flap, girl, think that I'm haunted
Ayy, ayy, I think that I'm haunted1Embed
