Bang bang
Gang gang
Bang Bang (Sosa baby)
Gang gang
Bang bang (GBE baby)

I'ma sit gang crazy motherfucka
I come through reeking like some onions
Put a hole in ya, now yo ass a Funyun
You talkin' shit but yo ass is funny
You taking shots Steph Curry, Paul Bunyan
But them skills ain't gon' help you in this riot
I'm smoking weed, rollin' weed I'm blinded (Dope)
I'm in Cali ridin' through Laurel Canyon

Situation Gang, Get It Gang, Blitz Gang
Chain Gang, Ear Gang, Wrist Gang
You lookin' girl I know you see the wrist game
I ain't gotta talk, ain't gotta spit game
I let my chain hang, try to take it bang bang
I got my feet up I ain't got to gang bang
Grind like I was Wayne got that car, show won't change
I was getting brain in my car switching lanes
Gotta get that cash, bitch I'm getting game
Diamonds In my chain I think I'm Pissy Gang
You knocking on my door I'm like "Who is it? Dang"
He like "I got some cash" I'm like "I get it gang"
Pull up to the club, Iâ€™m shittin'
I ain't gotta be friendly to yo bitch but I'm gon' hit that
Aye, pull up get that dub then I get back
In my car a nigga try to block me, he get shit bagged
You might also like
I'ma sit gang crazy motherfucka
I come through reeking like some onions
Put a hole in ya, now yo ass a Funyun
You talkin' shit but yo ass is funny
You taking shots Steph Curry, Paul Bunyan
But them skills ain't gon' help you when it's riot
I'm smoking weed, rollin' weed I'm blunted (Dope)
I'm in Cali ridin' through Laurel Canyan

I pull up reek of dope, ounces on me you ain't know
Sosa Marvin Gaye, hop out like let's get it on
Sosa Modern Day, Bonnie & Clyde down the road (Go)
Niggas tryna race me but I'm down the road dough
Pull up Dominoes, get my pizza vamonos
Sosa Dinero, with the mob I got rolls
Sosa Luciano, I got cars I got clothes
Pull up to the store watchu want? "Some of those"
Pull a $50 out my pocket and I blow my nose
I got flexin' bones, it's in my blood bitch I know
Pull a $20 out my pocket give it to the shorties
I'm a real nigga I ain't with that fuckin' bullshit

I'ma sit gang crazy motherfucka
I come through reeking like some onions
Put a hole in ya, now yo ass a Funyun
You talkin' shit but yo ass is funny
You taking shots Steph Curry, Paul Bunyan
But them skills ain't gon' help you when it's riot
I'm smoking weed, rollin' weed I'm blunted (Dope)
I'm in Cali ridin' through Laurel Canyan11Embed
