5 ContributorsBuy A Bank Lyrics
Don't put no battery in my bag, man
I got a whole 'nother focus, nigga
Twenty/20 Pyrex Vision, nigga
I can see it, nigga, you see it? (Yeah, yeah)
You see it, nigga? Let's go

Let's start off with a prayer for the sucka-niggas (Sucka-niggas)
Stay a thousand feet away from busta-niggas (Fuck 'em)
Fuck-niggas come with bad vibes though (Vibes though)
Bitch-made, I swear I gotta slide, dawg (Yeah)
911 faster than a cheetah, nigga (Woo)
Brand new Hanes wife-beater, nigga (Damn)
Makin' soda in the fridge next to the mustard, nigga (Mustard, nigga)
In the Ziploc bags, they from Publix, nigga (Haha)

Fuck a car, I'm tryna buy a bank, nigga (Bank, nigga)
Tonight is on me, so what you drink, nigga? (Drink, nigga)
I can't give a fuck 'bout what they think, nigga (Think, nigga)
I just do it 'cause they say I can't, nigga (Can't, nigga)

Pussy so wet, call her Aruba, nigga (Woo)
Think the feds probably took a Uber, nigga (Damn)
Black and speak Spanish, she from Cuba, nigga (Cuba, nigga)
Had them legs straighter than a ruler, nigga (Yeah)
Heard he got jammed, talk like a parakeet
Told 'em 'bout the pigeons in the Cherokee
Heard he crossed 'em like Tony did Sosa, nigga (Sosa, nigga)
I was somewhere on the beach sippin' mimosa, nigga
You might also like
Fuck a car, I'm tryna buy a bank, nigga (Bank, nigga)
Tonight is on me, so what you drink, nigga?
I can't give a fuck 'bout what they think, nigga (Think, nigga)
I just do it 'cause they say I can't, nigga

They doin' all that hatin', I give zero fucks (Zero fucks)
'Cause, nigga, all that hatin' make me zero bucks (Nah)
Kill 'em with success, that's a felony (Felony)
Before my time, nigga, I'm ahead of me (Yeah)

A pig is a hustler that don't fly straight (Hey)
That Audemar is set, I am not late (Hey)
My mind already made, I would not fail (Fail)
They said that I was done, I cannot tell (Haha)

Fuck a car, I'm tryna buy a bank, nigga (Bank, nigga)
Tonight is on me, so what you drink, nigga?
I can't give a fuck 'bout what they think, nigga (Think, nigga)
I just do it 'cause they say I can't, nigga (Yeah)

Fuck a car, I'm tryna buy a bank, nigga
Tonight is on me, so what you drink, nigga?
I can't give a fuck 'bout what they think, nigga
I just do it 'cause they say I can't, niggaEmbed
