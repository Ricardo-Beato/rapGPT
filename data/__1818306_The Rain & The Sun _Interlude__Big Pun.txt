And though the rain
Keeps fallin' down
I know the sun
Won't wash away
And though the rain
Keeps fallin' down
I know the sun
Won't wash away

You see, that's what I do
I sing, that's my outlet
You need one

I ain't no fuckin' singer

But you are-
One of the best I've ever heard
When you rhyme-
It's like, it's like music to me
It's magic
Don't ever take it for granted
You have a gift
You might also like
And though the rain
Keeps fallin' down
I know the sun
Won't wash away
And though the rain
Keeps fallin' down
I know the sun
Won't wash away

You have to share it
Understand?
Come on Pun
Just try
One time
Then they all know
You understand?
Then they all know
That you the one

And though the rain
Keeps fallin' down
I know the sun
Won't wash away
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Like that Twin
You got it
Now they all know
Got you Props
You know I got you Twin
Much love2Embed
