48 ContributorsTheme Song Lyrics
You can act stupid if you want to
Never play by the rules, do just what I want to
Came up in this bitch tongue out without a front tooth
Now who they say is number one influencer, he number two (Yeah)
Yeah, he dance good, but guess where he got the moves?
But compared to me, look like he wear two left shoes (Uh)
Boy, I treat them lil' virgins like the restroom
Take my hand and dance with the devil (Yeah)
Oh, boy, you in trouble, rattled the lion cage
Hope God strikes you down while you're prayin' on stage (Uh)
Jit at your burial, smoke squares at your grave
Then repent for my sins like, "God, I'm saved" (Alright)
He always forgive, later on, I forget
I had my fingers crossed, so I'm back on that shit
Catch another body 'fore the song get mixed
The bullets is the lyrics, turn the rapper to a spirit (Yeah)
Singin' with the angels, nigga long gone
Your song's like Bishop Eddie Long with a thong on (Uh)
Nigga, I'm the wrong one to front on
My balls on her Kit-Kat, now she playin' ping-pong (Alright)

Nigga, this the theme song for bitch-ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger
Nigga, this the theme song for bitch-ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger (Yeah)
You might also like
Listen here, Little Richard, I don't know what got into you
Did more for the game than you (Yeah)
That's why I had to cut into ya, ya need to be checked
Lil' niggas need to learn some respect (Alright)
When your show's like the Rockettes, with some majorettes
Gimme a mic, and a DJ, and I'm set (Yeah)
'Cause these bars on deck, ain't gotta shake my ass
You the real definition of "ants in your pants"
Got a son, lil' niggas, no child support (Yeah)
Sorta like the Bad Boys up against Jordan
But, nigga, you ain't scorin', not on me
Wrote this one on one knee, R.I.P. to P (Damn)
Taught me to keep it real, stand on my own (Yeah)
If I got you, rock a nigga brain with his nose bone
No time for the gimmicks (Yeah)
And I ain't gotta lie when I say I'm independent (Alright)

Nigga, this the theme song for bitch-ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger
Nigga, this the theme song for bitch-ass niggas (Yeah)
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger (Damn)
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
(Alright)
(Damn)6Embed
