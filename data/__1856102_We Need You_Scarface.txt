1 ContributorWe Need You Lyrics
I come from the '80s, so I rep my hood
I'm a gangsta 'til I'm dead and so it's understood
That if I died tryna get it, it was time then
Don't nobody shed tears, that was how it went
It's for them young cats and them old dudes
This is soul food for your soul, fool
Like I told you, I gotta represent
For my boys doing time, state and fed pen
Stiff as a dead man, you know the rules, dawg
You take these stories to the grave, we don't do logs
And we don't talk to police, take your shoes off
And we don't talk to police, take your shoes off
These dudes soft, so they cop pleas
They hot boys, hot boys, so they watch me
I'm not free, I've got wings
Don't let me ride sweet chariot, stop and swing slow

You said you ain't no rich nigga — I don't believe you
You ain't no snitch nigga — I don't believe you
I've been the shit, nigga — I never seen you
You tryna hide behind that badge? You're lookin' see-through

I know niggas workin', know niggas steal and rob
Know niggas rockin' quarter ki's off of jelly jars
They sell it soft, 'cause when you sell it hard
Them federali boys hit niggas with hella charges
Regardless, if you ain't did shit
Then you shouldn't have said shit, but you said shit
'Cause I done read this
Bitch, you need your motherfuckin' head split
To the deadness, you dead, bitch
You don't exist, I smell fish
Like a funk hole, a punk, though
This punk sold his soul for a lesser charge
Thought that he was real but this figure here was just a broad
He's stressin' hard, but here's the lesson, y'all
Watch these motherfuckers 'cause they plottin' tryna catch us all
Ain't no confessions, dawg, they try to question y'all
Tell 'em read your rights and let you go 'cause you can't help at all
You might also like
You said you ain't no rich nigga — I don't believe you
You ain't no snitch nigga — I don't believe you
I've been the shit, nigga — I never seen you
You tryna hide behind that badge? You're lookin' see-through

The shit is real, ain't no looking back
The plot thickens, these niggas comin' to against
This hood life, that's hood, though
You live by the same thing you die for
What you ride for?
I'm an old school cat from the Southside, so I tote two
Five-shot titanium tramp fin sevens
When they get charged, brain get split like melon on the sidewalk
Pussy, you frog, I could see you
Talk that big shit but you see-through
Don't believe you, need more people
I was fed with the game, you was fed with seafood
The evils that we do
Looks can deceive you, words to take heed to
I leave you to read through
Swing down sweet chariot, stop, we need you

You said you ain't no rich nigga — I don't believe you
You ain't no snitch nigga — I don't believe you
I've been the shit, nigga — I never seen you
You tryna hide behind that badge? You're lookin' see-throughEmbed
