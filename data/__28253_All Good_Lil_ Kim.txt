(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh) Yeah
(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh)
(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh)
(It's all good, all good) Yeah (all good, all good)
(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh)
(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh)
Yeah (It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh)
(It's all good, all good, all good, all good)
(It's all good)

Every word I utter, I feel strictly gutter
That's why I touch more green than Tiger's putter
So you mad motherfuckers mutter what you wanna
I ain't worried 'bout none of ya and I'll say it in front of ya
I hear the snakes hiss, talkin reckless
Thought I'd let it go and I wouldn't stress it
Haters in the street, y'all worse than the press is
And they all wanna hang like the charm on my necklace
Guess things just ain't the same for gangsters
How a snitch nigga make a record called wankstas?
Everything these haters do just to degrade ya
Only made me strong, I say thanks for the favor
Now the D.A., wanna give me time in the feds
I'm from Brooklyn, I could do that time on my head
Come down with my weave straight sittin on bread
At the gate, gettin picked up in a new Coupe Phantom

See I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, my nigga need bail
It's been a couple weeks and he been sittin' in a cell
The only way to reach him through phone calls and mail
Balloons stuffed with luh up in the chocha
Now my man in the can gettin' money and gettin' high
He used to keep my fly he had the 6 I had the 5
So you know a chick gon' ride or die for her guy
At age 14 I was puttin' on weight
At age 16 I was movin' the weight
Gettin paid for drivin' state to state
Smugglin' weight, prayin I don't bump into Jake
I travelled through a few places with the burners
In the suitcases, thank God for Big
Damn right I love the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all
(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh) - Dudes run around stuntin and frontin
(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh) - Talkin shit but ain't sayin nuttin

(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh) - Cracked a smile when they saw me on trial
(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh) - You know you can't keep a good bitch down, it's all good
(It's all good, all good, all good, all good) - It's all good
(It's all good) (Gangsta) (Uh, uh)

Cowards huff and puff but won't blow shit down
I come through like two airplanes in midtown
Nigga my get back's the get down
Hit the big nigga first and make the rest sit down
They all talk loud, when they see you they quiet down
Faggots violated I wish they'd try now
Just watch how they bitch up, story start to switch up
Punks gettin left off right where I pick up
Picture in Vogue, Spring/Summer issue
Shoot game official like a ref with a whistle
You know when I do it I'm doin it monumental
Leave you speechless kinda like an instrumental
They ask me if I know what true happiness
Do I ever feel regret for all the things I did?
Hell no I love the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all
