8 ContributorsI’m From Lyrics
I'm from Slauson, where shit get drastic down here
Fuck a room, go to sleep in a casket
I’m from Slauson, where shit get drastic down here
Fuck a room, go to sleep in a casket
I'm from Slauson, where shit get drastic down here
Fuck a room, go to sleep in a casket
I'm from Slauson, where shit get drastic down here
Fuck a room, go to sleep in a casket

My nigga, why you come ’round here?
Knowing you ain't from 'round here?
That's how you get robbed and shot
Lil' niggas they got guns 'round here
'Cause niggas die young 'round here
So you better get off the block
My nigga, why you come ’round here?
Knowing you ain’t from 'round here?
That’s how you get robbed and shot
And lil' niggas they got guns 'round here
'Cause niggas die young ’round here
So you better get off the–
Let's take the block through my hood

Crenshaw corner stores, dope spots on the low
Young homies hit the pen, OG's on parole (Let's go)
Dice games in the back, air holes in the MAC
Leather on my seats, burners stashed in my Cadillac (Yeah)
Yellow tape, white chalk, 10th Ave, Hyde Park
Young black males catchin' hell from them white cops
G-ride on one, two homies, three guns (Uh-huh)
Hoppin' out, killin' shit, four-five semi-spit (Bah)
Four-five niggas hit by retaliation, go
Somebody got to die, that's just a part of gang bangin' (Yah)
And Bush keep talkin' 'bout the war in the Middle East
But he don't give a fuck about this war in these city streets
So fuck peace, I'ma ride on my enemies (Uh-huh)
And friends is somethin' we can never pretend to be
I'm showin' you somethin' that you was never meant to see (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You might lose your life, there's killers in the vicinity
You might also like
My nigga, why you come 'round here?
Knowing you ain't from 'round here?
That's how you get robbed and shot
Lil' niggas they got guns 'round here

Let's take the block through my hood

Brynhurst, 63rd (Yeah), flip work off the curb
Duck C.R.A.S.H. cops and hop gates, when I hear the bird
Young flips give me head, tryna keep me in the bed
Once I get my nut, I'm out the door, I'm all about my bread
Westside killers ride (Yeah), never seen a nigga die
Now he trippin', traumatized, humbled from the homicide (Ayy)
Gang bang nigga shit (Uh), same day different shit (Yah)
More drama than a soap opera where I'm livin' bitch
And everybody talkin' bout stop snitchin'
Now there's cameras on your street lights, so they don't need a witness (Pay attention)
They come to court with a tape on your ass
Got your face on blast (Uh-huh), close cased on your ass (Yeah)
I let her off ten shots, I got plenty to go (Alright)
Do a nigga like O-Dog, did that bitch in the store, for real (Ah)
'Cause when Caine was on the set filmin' Menace (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We was servin' on the steps, no respect for the tenants
My nigga, why you come 'round here?
Knowing you ain't from 'round here?
That's how you get robbed and shot
Lil' niggas they got guns 'round here
'Cause niggas die young 'round here
So you better get off the block

Let's take the block through my hood

I'm Rimpau 5-8, I'm Crenshaw ace-ace
I'm blue steal 38's, I send 'em to the pearly gates
I'm young cuz, get it straight
White tee, Bathing Ape
I smoke big kush with S-Black and Big Wake
I sag thousand dollar jeans, mind on another page
Come and get money, nigga, grind rocks from the cage
Violence and one-time, hustle on another stage
Pop shops, C.R.A.S.H. cops, niggas livin' in a rage
Under street lights, in my district, get way bad
I'm hardcore,  , I'm dope-blocked, 8th Ave
I post up, set shop, go hard, and get cash
Lean on the gate with a 'K and a face mask
So if you think you touchin' us, not hardly
When the rifle blast it sound like the pipes on a Harley
If you think I'm new around here, I beg your pardon
I'm Slauson Avenue, I'm lil' Marcus Garvey, nigga
My nigga, why you come 'round here?
Knowing you ain't from 'round here?
That's how you get robbed and shot
Lil' niggas they got guns 'round here
'Cause niggas die young 'round here
So you better get off the block
My nigga, why you come 'round here?
Knowing you ain't from 'round here?
That's how you get robbed and shot
And lil' niggas they got guns 'round here
