I'm the shit 'til I die
Aw, yes, Luv Is Rage
Aw, yeah, Luv Is Rage
I'm the shit 'til I die
Aw, yeah, Luv Is Rage

Sorry, baby girl, I gotta go right now
Even though I want you, I can't take you home right now
I'ma let you take the number to my phone right now
You gon' force me just to get up in my zone right now
Sorry, baby girl, I gotta go right now
Even though I want you, I can't take you home right now
I'ma let you take the number to my phone right now
You gon' force me just to get up in my zone right now

First off, I just be high, I be smoking the dope
Got a little bitch that be sniffing the coke
Living my life like I cannot go broke
I stay living my life like I cannot go broke
Don't jump in a 'Rari, I jump in a Ghost
Ain't fucking your sister I ain't fucking your hoes
I went to jeweler, put my mouth on froze
I'm stacking my mula, I'm gettin' this dough
Remember I rocked that Givenchy sweater
On the front of that bitch it had a Cujo
I'm stacking my money, I'm counting blue notes (Yeah)
You look at my pockets, fat just like glucose
If you wanna rumble, I jab at yo' nose
If she wanna tumble, get passed to my bros
Rock Mr. Completey and 424 clothes
Me and my brothers got four super hoes

Oh, yeah (I'm the shit 'til I die)
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh (I'm the shit 'til I die)
Oh, oh

Sorry, baby girl, I gotta go right now
Even though I want you, I can't take you home right now
I'ma let you take the number to my phone right now
You gon' force me just to get up in my zone right now
Sorry, baby girl, I gotta go right now
Even though I want you, I can't take you home right now
I'ma let you take the number to my phone right now
You gon' force me just to get up in my zone right now

Yeah, I just be high off the Xans (Xans)
Super geeked up off the Xans (Xans)
School bus that's right in my hand
School bus that's right in my hand, yeah
I rock hard like I'm in a band, yeah
Your little bitch, she is a fan, yeah
Lil' nigga getting big money, yeah
Go to the beach, get a tan, yeah
Jump in the crowd with my fans, yeah
Jump in the crowd with my fans, yeah
Water, water on my wrist, yeah
Water, water on my hands, yeah
Three wheels like a Can-Am
Throwing stacks like a band man
Break your arm like I'm Van Damme
Count it up, I'm the band man (Yeah)
Baby girl, take my number (Number)
Baby girl better call (Call)
Getting money every day (Day)
Every day, I'ma ball (Ball)
Baby girl, do not stall (Stall)
Grab the handle, flip the doors (Doors)
Either you gon' drop yo' drawers (Drawers)
Or I'ma kick it with my dogs
You, you gon' force me just to get up in my zone right now

Sorry, baby girl, I gotta go right now
Even though I want you, I can't take you home right now
I'ma let you take the number to my phone right now
You gon' force me just to get up in my zone right now

Yeah, you know that Luv Is Rage34Embed
