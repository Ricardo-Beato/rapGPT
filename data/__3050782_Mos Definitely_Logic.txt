71 ContributorsMos Definitely Lyrics
I don't know what I’ma do
I don't know where I’ma live
'Cause it feel like I ain't got nothing to give
Just wanna follow my dreams
Just wanna follow my heart
But the world wanna tear me apart right from start
Everything I ever wanted, it ain't what I thought
Bring it back to the roots like my name Black Thought
This shit right here, no it can't be taught
Gotta be learned, it gotta be earned
I ain't got a pocket full of money but I'm full of hope
I don't wanna rob people, I don't wanna push dope
I just wanna live, I just wanna maintain
Like a bullet to the brain
Gotta play the game like a chess board
If yah wanna go to war, gotta bring yah best sword
I feel like I'm going crazy, like I need a psych ward
Think my mind playing tricks on me like a Geto Boy
Feel like I need to murder 'em in the moment I deploy
Everybody, anybody, somebody fill the void, somebody fill the void
Listen, I don't wanna work a job, motherfuck a 9 to 5
Every time I get a check, what I really get? Robbed
Livin in America, this shit is a facade
But you gotta push through and persevere, word to God
Tryna find a home, but I can't afford a home
'Cause I'm 25 and owe a hunnid grand in student loans
Tryna get healthcare, but I'm on welfare
Man I swear to god, I wish I was living in Bel Air
Fuck Medicaid, I just wanna get paid
Wit' a couple bad bitches at the crib, gettin' laid
That's what I'm taught by the media
Television tellin' my vision to get greedier
Come now everybody stay tune like T-Pain
Operate the drive in yah mind like a keychain
Come now folk, get woke, stay woke
'Cause the white man want the black man stay broke
Fuck that, I'm finna buck back
But not wit bullets, I’ma use my education to the fullest
I’ma get out of debt, I'ma reset
I’ma get out of debt, I'ma reset
Do whatever you gotta do whenever to live
But you gotta remember to give back when you get that When you finally get to the top and you hit that pinnacle
I ain't being cynical, I'm just being real
I believe that everybody feel, everybody feel, listen up Everybody over here
I promise to God on everything it ain't nothing to fear Anybody that can hear, just fight
Fight for the right
Fight for ya life
Fight for what you believe is right
Fight for what you believe is right
Everybody fight
Everybody fight
Matter fact, everybody beautiful
But right, what now I need
