59 ContributorsX Men Lyrics
Ayy, uh, ayy, bitch
Ayy, Lil Boat, uh, Lil Boat, yeah, Lil Boat

Runnin' head first in your shindig (Uh)
Boy your raps weak, keep your day gig (Uh)
19 years old, I got 7 figs (Yeah)
Break the bitch back like a tree twig (Bitch)
I love myself more than anybody (Anybody)
Fuck I look like in a Maserati?
I leave that shit to the trap stars (Real)
A nigga like me, I'm a busy body (Lil Boat)
Lie on my name and get relevant (What)
Later you'll tell the truth, sayin' sorry (Brrr)
My AR keep a AR (Doo doo)
He find that heat while he tote the heat
Big booty bitch, that's a cheat sheet, uh
She fiending, she want a meat peek, uh
Take the lil' bitch to the bathroom (Yeah)
Let her eat all of my skeet skeet, uh
Cool, you gettin' dub money (What)
I'm gettin' one-twenty up money (True)
I'm gettin' two-thirty plus money (True)
I saw your Patek, it look funny
You goin' downhill like Gumby cut (Yeah)
My bitch upscale, she a fancy slut (Yeah)
I want a brand new Bentley coupe (Woo)
I don't really fuck with that Bentley truck (Skrrt skrrt)

Lot of foreign
Fuck I just started?
Wishin' to Henny
Diamonds on flex
Tuck it, I'm blessed
Drippin', I'm wet
Fuck her, she wet
Ooh, big body Benz
Hop out, president
Rollie president
Iced out all my friends
Call us X-Men
Cyclops Fendis, yeah

Take a sip, bye

Niggas always sayin' what they finna do next
Shawty told me she not into you, next
Ain't really for all that pillow talk
But I put my nut where she kisses you
Yes, I'm a dog with a Gucci collar
I get that brain like a Harvard scholar
I'm sure you saw that one comin'
But I bet you ain't seen a million dollars
I like to stunt on a bitch boy, uh
Diamonds is simply my wrist toy, uh
Niggas be simply decoys, ooh
Test me, my niggas gon' deploy, grrr
I'm bangin', I'm bangin', I'm passin' 'em, mmm
Countin' it, stackin' it, flexin' it, yeah
If she pretty, promise I'm sexin' it (Woo)
Don't give me no gift, ain't no checkin' it (Nah)
You talk to me crazy, I'm checkin' you (Grrr)
I really feel broke standin' next to you (What)
You don't have a place in my heart, bro (Nope)
I saw what you drive, it's a cart, bro (What)
You shouldn't want beef from the start (Uh-uh)
Everywhere I drive leave marks (Yeah)
All of you niggas is marks (Yeah)
You stinky and dirty like farts (Uh)
Lot of foreign
Fuck I just started?
Wishin' to Henny
Diamonds on flex
Tuck it, I'm blessed
Drippin', I'm wet
Fuck her, she wet
Ooh, big body Benz
Hop out, president
Rollie president
Ice out all my friends
Call us X-Men
Cyclops Fendis, yeah
Swipe, swipe, swipe
Take a sip, bye
