3 ContributorsNip Hussle Interlude Pt. 2 Lyrics
Bullets Ain't Got No Names Volume 2
Neighborhood Nip Hussle, All Money In No Money Out
Slauson Boy
What it do, y'all?
Reportin' to you muh'fuckas live from the booth
I don't tell lies, it's nothin' but the truth
Hustle music
Yeah, kush and Patron got me on right now, fuckin' wit' y'all
Shit is crazy to me how...
("My life, my life, my life, my life, in the sunshine")
A nigga'll kill you 'cause you fuck his bitch
But you'll ride again and let it slide, feel me?
Or a nigga'll wanna come take your head off 'cause you fuck over him
Feel me, put tips on a nigga, put him on his pockets
Give him what he came for
Nigga wanna go get his burner and kill you, feel me?
Leave me to think these niggas got the game fucked up
See, it's not what you do, it's why you do what you do
Feel me, that's who make you who you are, homie
See, me, I'ma let my actions speak for me
I done seen it all, done it all out here, my nigga
My solution: All Money In No Money OutYou might also likeEmbed
