17 ContributorsMr. Wop Lyrics
J. White, I need the beat I can go off on

You changed on me, Mr. Wop
You're not the same Gucci Mane from the block
And you're so mean to the meanest
And your bling is the cleanest
And your chains must be worth a lot
You're not the same to me, Mr. Wop
With all the planes and the rings and the watch
You're the worst and you know it
You got cash and you blow it
And your things must be worth a lot

I don't like Gucci Mane, shawty changed on me
He ain't the same, there's somethin' about him, there's somethin' strange to me
Maybe the money or the clothes or the jewels he rock
He don't just wear the watch, he abuse the wok
So outlandish man, that they can't stand the man
I'm a living urban legend just like Candyman
Nose candy man, I served it hand to hand
Sniper rifle like a soldier in Afghanistan
I let my money and my car do all the talking (Cha-ching)
I'm the Grinch, I'll put an artist in a coffin (Uh)
Fuck a dog, I'll let my gat do all the barking
Know you a bitch, but you a pussy, you's a softy
You might also like
You changed on me, Mr. Wop
You're not the same Gucci Mane from the block
And you're so mean to the meanest
And your bling is the cleanest
And your chains must be worth a lot
You're not the same to me, Mr. Wop
With all the planes and the rings and the watch
You're the worst and you know it
You got cash and you blow it
And your things must be worth a lot

When you hit a lick I'll be the fence (Be the fence)
I'll loan you money when you in a pinch (In a pinch)
You gotta pay me back really quick (With the quickness)
Gotta charge ya interest, nigga, I'm the Grinch (I'm the Grinchy)
Had a murder charge but they couldn't convict (Can't convict me)
If the glove don't fit you must acquit (You must acquit)
Got a Jewish lawyer runnin' my defense
Let me out before the gavel hit the bench
I'm the Grinch that made ya eat that other bitch
Mistletoe on my dick, I made 'em kiss
These broke niggas mad 'cause they on the bench (They on the bench)
I'm on the courtside, ballin' like Swish (Swish)
You changed on me, Mr. Wop
You're not the same Gucci Mane from the block (The Grinch)
And you're so mean to the meanest
And your bling is the cleanest
And your chains must be worth a lot (Yuh)
You're not the same to me, Mr. Wop
With all the planes and the rings and the watch
You're the worst and you know it
You got cash and you blow it
And your things must be worth a lot (Go)
