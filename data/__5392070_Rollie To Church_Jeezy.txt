4 ContributorsRollie To Church Lyrics
Yeah
You know what it is, nigga
Let's go

I'm as fearless they come (Come), this as hard as it get (Hard as it get)
One thing I ain't did is ask a nigga for shit (Nah)
See I took me a loss, yeah, that made me a boss (Made me a boss)
Young blood with the millions, see I was shakin' them off (Yeah)
Born allergic to broke, might just catch me a rash (Catch me a rash)
Say he got me a ten, might just buy me a half (Damn)
Same clothes all week, might need to take me a bath
AR with the drum, look like I'm straight out of M*A*S*H (Woo)
Hope I make it to Heaven, and that's word to the reverend
Yeah, we livin' in Hell, but who the Hell gon' tell 'em?

Brought my Rollie to church (Church), but that might make it worse
Only thing I ain't drove, yeah, that's a drop-top hearse
Brought my, brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Brought my, brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Only thing I ain't drove, yeah, that's a drop-top hearse

I was dottin' my "i"s (I's), I was crossin' my "t"s (T's)
Take two rubber bands, wrap it up, 5 G's (Yeah)
Take a guess, it's a lot, ain't no shoes in the box (Nah)
Two-tone chinchilla 'cause I was sly as a fox (Haha)
Streets taught me a lot, streets taught me to weave (Weave)
So much smoke in the kitchen, I dare a nigga to breathe (Dang)
Got me stuck in the trenches and they ain't want me to leave (Nah)
In here that concrete jungle, but when you can't see the trees (Woo)
Had to think out the box (Box), had to break out the blocks (Break out the blocks)
Got a call from my Granny like, "Where you put all my pots?"

Brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Only thing I ain't drove, yeah, that's a drop-top hearse
Brought my, brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Brought my, brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Only thing I ain't drove, yeah, that's a drop-top hearse
Brought my, brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Brought my, brought my Rollie to church, but that might make it worse
Only thing I ain't drove, yeah, that's a drop-top hearse

Brought my, brought my, bro-brought my Rollie
Brought my, brought my, bro-brought my Rollie
Brought my, brought my, bro-brought my Rollie
Brought my, brought my, bro-brought my RollieEmbed
