78 ContributorsEnemies Lyrics
Yeah (Damn), yeah (Damn, damn, grand slam, damn)
Lil Uzi
That be Maaly Raw!

Got no friends, um, next to me, enemies too close
Raf Simons on my feet, that's why I fucked your ho
Middle fingers to my enemies, I stay in my glow
And you know they gonna intervene, my niggas do the most
Ballin', I'm just on it, I'm just on it
Gettin' all this money off recordin'
Pourin', I keep pourin', I keep pourin'
Know some lil' niggas that'll rock you for some Jordans

Taking double G's in navy blue jeans like a carbon
Oh, you wanna try me, walk around you with the carbine
Once again I had your bitch, you don't believe me?
Now you stalking
Now you see that shit, now your heart is so broken
Now she all on me, had me lost in the moment
Drinking Hennessy, don't get drunk, now I'm zonin'
All my bitch grade A, fuck with B's and some C's though
Number 1 that vroom, watch out for the Buick Regal
Number 1 that vroom, watch out for them Grand Marquis
In the hood, with my chains on, with my nina
If you talk shit, they will kill you, that's how I feel
All the old folks, see us run wild, call us heathens
Balling like Kobe, I never get cold
All of this shit, yeah, I did on my own
Talk to my momma she said me get grown
Mama be quiet, gon' buy you a home
I'm on a diet, that's pussy and dope
I'm on a diet, that's pussy and dope
I'm on a diet, that's pussy and dope
Counting my money, I'm gettin' this dough
You might also like
Got no friends, um, next to me, enemies too close
Raf Simons on my feet, that's why I fucked your ho
Middle fingers to my enemies, I stay in my glow
And you know they gonna intervene, my niggas do the most
Ballin', I'm just on it, I'm just on it
Gettin' all this money off recordin'
Pourin', I keep pourin', I keep pourin'
Know some lil' niggas that'll rock you for some Jordans

I'm rocking Rick Owens, your bitch on my dick and that bitch she be hoeing
Lil Uzi, I swear that I just be going
Lil Uzi, I swear that I just be flowing (Aye)
Drinkin' that lean when I'm with my nigga Scheme
I swear to God, that I just be pouring
Move like a captain and we never lackin'
I swear to God that we stay up into the mornin'
Niggas like my style, oh, yeah, I know it
Niggas bite my style, oh, yeah, I know it
Jump in the 'Rari and I'm gonna floor it
Skitter the engine when that bitch be roarin'
Wiz dropped by when I was just tourin'
Wiz dropped by when I was just tourin'
Collect all my calls and I ball like I'm Jordan
I made a porno and your bitch was the star
You a bitch nigga and you already know
And my brother, he be whippin' the stove
All of my niggas be grippin' the poles
Number one rule, do not trip on no ho
You can not get this shit right here in the store
You can not get this shit right here in the store
I'mma ball like I am old Derrick Rose
I be ballin' like I am Amber Rose
Got no friends, um, next to me, enemies too close
Raf Simons on my feet, that's why I fucked your ho
Middle fingers to my enemies, I stay in my glow
And you know they gonna intervene, my niggas do the most
Ballin', I'm just on it, I'm just on it
Gettin' all this money off recordin'
Pourin', I keep pourin', I keep pourin'
Know some lil' niggas that'll rock you for some Jordans

I be ballin' like, I took the position
Of the starter, I'm your father like collar
Waiter, what you doing? Why you waiting?
Bitches on my dick now, these niggas hatin'
But they act, like they ain' out, here hatin'
When I be around, they participating
Drive around in that new shit, like I'm racing
I be dishin' all these bars
Throwin' out like I'm Peyton
Why you always on my ho, though?
When she up in Soho
She look at you, even if she wasn't say she taken
Never had this much money, so a nigga pacin'
Put my dick in her, now the thought leave her shakin'
Okay, good food I'm tastin', bitch, you leave in the AM
Smoke more than a damn Frenchman
Man, my girl like Sanaa Lathan
Like I'mma legend in the making
Fuck nigga get Nathan
I'm flexin', finessin'
You rockin' Giuseppe
Your pockets ain' what I be rakin'
Got no friends, um, next to me, enemies too close
Raf Simons on my feet, that's why I fucked your ho
Middle fingers to my enemies, I stay in my glow
And you know they gonna intervene, my niggas do the most
Ballin', I'm just on it, I'm just on it
Gettin' all this money off recordin'
Pourin', I keep pourin', I keep pourin'
Know some lil' niggas that'll rock you for some Jordans45Embed
