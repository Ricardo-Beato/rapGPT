11 ContributorsLong Lyrics
Everything long here
Crib long, cars long, guns long, some guns short
Everything long though, know how we rocking
Glo Gang, we the shit for a long time
Bang, bang

I got long money, long hair
I got long money, long hair
You don't want war, don't go there
Choppa blowing shit down, cold air
Long hair, long racks
Long clip, it's strong gat
Long blunts, it's strong pack
Everything long now

Tadoe got long money with him, what the fuck I got?
A nigga run up in my face, I'm like, "Back up off my gat"
I bought all the Swisher Sweets for all the strong pack
I bought all these fucking things for all the wrong guys
I heard niggas plotting on me, I'll let my gun handle it
'Cause I'm a rich nigga now, and bitch, my gun savage
I'm an AMG nigga, ayy, bitch, my car savage
All these niggas steady talking 'bout they savage
Glock 40, the clip be long, it's long
'Fore we shoot you in your dome, go home
They like, "Sosa, you get money too long," you wrong
Just hit my phone if you needing a loan
You might also like
I got long money, long hair
I got long money, long hair
You don't want war, don't go there
Choppa blowing shit down, cold air
Long hair, long racks
Long clip, it's strong gat
Long blunts, it's strong pack
Everything long nowEmbed
