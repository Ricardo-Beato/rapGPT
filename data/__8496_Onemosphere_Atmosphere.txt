You're so ugly
You're so ugly

Atmosphere, and maybe you don't like us
But of all the stars in the sky, believe we're one of the brightest
My life is as trife as your favorite rap record
And I'm possessed with that insight that enables me to laugh better
From the last letter back to the 'A', from around my way
Out of the wrapping paper without the fucking holiday
Can't never be captured, they can toy with my shell
But only after they walk a mile backwards through b-boy hell
From here on out the sun rises at noon thirty
And it ain't quit pressing till the whole f-ing room heard me
Soon the birdy will fly with or without the wings
As straight as the equator, as nosy as the owl sings
Let the poppers pop, let the breakers break
Make the DJs and the assholes and all the rappers snakes
And most graff writers are weirdos nowadays
So I hang out with myself and a rafter and a belt
Every chapter that I happen to skim
Appears if it must've been written by me or the brothers Grimm
And the moral to the story comes equipped with a sting
Once again I'm picked for the wrong fucking team (fucking team)
You might also like
Now I'm sleeping on floors of temporary friends
But I'm keeping the store front as clean as I can
And I'm sweeping the sky for today's revelation
And I'm needing some time and some proper ventilation
And I'm building a house for everyone to hold
And I'm filling your mouth with the keys to my soul
And your spitting me out, piece together the puzzle
You got to get it all out while you're learning how to juggle
And the bricks weigh more then they led you to believe
Remember never let nobody lead you to believe
September was the first time I had to breathe
So I learned to hate harvest, thought it had a trick up its sleeve
Not fucking with the Joneses, I guess that I been jonesing so much
Nothing gets noticed but the mess
And I'm smoking my stress through an empty beer can
It goes one Minnesota, two Minnesota, three
