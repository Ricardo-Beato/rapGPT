75 ContributorsAll Sinatra Everything Lyrics
"Young Sinatra" "It's like this, man, niggas, man
Niggas know not to fuck around with this shit though
I don't give a fuck how nasty niggas get" "Nah son
Let me tell these niggas something, God
I don't want niggas sounding like me... on no album
Keep it real, get your own shit, man, and be original
"Word up" "That's all, man" "Be a better man"
"And you gon', you gon' come out on your own way
Whatever how you gon' take it, man, fuck it" "Rat Pack niggas"

Ayo, I force MC's to bleed, retreat and recede
That's the Young Sinatra creed, killin' a track with incredible speed
And doin' it like it's nothin', no bluffin', gotta kill it everyday though
Slice MC's like Kato, gotchya head spinnin' like dreidel
Assassinate 'em so fatal, grip the heat and then tell ya to freeze
Gettin' cheddar at negative thirty degrees
I'm talkin' mula, money, euro, dollars, that yen
Blow it, let's spend it again, I'm livin' the life until the end
Can't comprehend what I got goin', never knowin' when Logic flowin'
'Cause I'm creepin', like ether the way that I seep in
Swimmin' in women like the deep end
Chillin' with shorties that smoke reefer and blow like Aretha, uh
Now, Sinatra said the best revenge is massive success
I guess that's women and multiple digits in excess
Ya family broke bread, but my family's bread was soggy
Till my brothers broke bricks like Mr. Miyagi
Now what the fuck…

"Bring it on if you think you can hang"
"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "You are watching a master at work"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think—" (Yeah, uh, yeah) "Logic" (Yeah)

All of a sudden I feel the inner killer emergin'
Never splurgin', bingin' money and never purgin'
Urgin' women to fuck on the rug 'cause it's imported Persian
Then bypass matters of the heart like a surgeon
Now, it's hard to ball when there's problems within the inner circle
One moment they cool as Stefan then flip it like Urkel
Or flip it like keys, yeah, they flip it like ki's
From drug lords overseas that export it with ease
Bitch please, we stack cheese so old, it's mold
I'm 'bout that money, so excuse me if my heart is cold
The magnum deployed, then I destroy mattresses
Late night love affairs with New York City actresses ("Rat Pack niggas")
I broke in the game and destroyed the first couple stages
Visionary takin' over regardless of our ages
Makin' history today to solidify in the pages of tomorrow
The industry is fucked, nothin' but sorrow, but I'm
Playin' for keeps in other words no need to borrow
So you can keep your advances, wack hooks, and pop dances
Don't get me wrong, I'm all about the mainstream
As long as I sign the deal I want and have the same team
And now they trippin' like a flight to Vegas
Tellin' me that I'll never make it and this shit is outrageous
Now what the fuck...
"Bring it on if you think you can hang"
"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "You are watching a master at work"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think—" (Yeah)
(Motherfucker) "Logic"

Therefore you're never mourn like a memory repressed
MC's digest quicker than bullets shot from a gat with the barrel suppressed
One to the dome, two to the chest
If by chance they got a vest, however nevertheless
I'm lookin' for that real deal, shit that make me feel
Pleasure and pain, ain't no way to measure the game
I got haters in fifty-seven languages, watch me vanquish this
The come up, bust quicker than .357 caliber
Sharp as Excalibur, crushin' muthafuckas like Gallagher now
Time is money, something you can never recoup
So stop wastin' mine, hit rewind and then fuckin' regroup
Never messed with them chicken heads, but catch me in the coupé ("Rat Pack niggas")
Never in public 'cause I'm a studio fiend
Rockin' diamonds and gettin' money, we call that ice cream
Now, allow me to give you the scoop, shit, I'll make it a double
I came up around more rocks than Barney Rubble
Murderers and drug dealers, I knew it no rebuttal
Ain't no need to claim it, picked up the heat, but never aimed it
Now Jay gave us The Blueprint, I lay the foundation
Tell ya what I'm facin', bars like incarceration
'Cause my mind is always racin', ain't no time for vacations
I'm never pacin', unless I'm on the phone talkin' business
Get wit' this, best witness like Christmas, I'm fuckin' rappin'
Walk in the spot and all these haters go for the dap and
I never carried 'em, kill 'em with kindness then bury 'em, yeah
I was born with talent, God gave me the gift
And now I pull more strings than guitar riffs
What the fuck…
"Bring it on if you think you can hang"
"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "Rat Pack niggas"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing" "You are watching a master at work"
"Yeah, bring it on if you think—"
