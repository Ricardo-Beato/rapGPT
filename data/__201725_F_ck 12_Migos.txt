31 ContributorsF*ck 12 Lyrics
Call Rel Money, talking bout money nothin but 100’s
Thats the sound of them mockingbirds and they humming
Bow bow prow, that’s them hollow tips as they comin
Up with yo skirt!
Woo woo, fuck Gwinnett County
Fuck!
Da fuck?
Aye throw that shit, throw that shit 12 outside
Hurry up man, hurry up man
Let go nigga, let’s go put em up

It's a knock at my front door
12 kickin' in my front door
Now we running out the back door
Drop the pistol, this the life of that bando
It's a knock at my front door
12 kickin' in my front door
Now we running out the back door
Drop the pistol, this the life of that bando

It’s a narc on my front door
They looking for Takeoff, they heard on the streets I be selling that blow (who?)
It’s a pot on a stove
Up in a bowl, 100 blunts rolled (gas)
I hit the back door
Me and Quavo meet Offset at the store
Call Rel Money, talking bout money
Nothing but hunnids
That's the sound of them mocking birds as they humming
That’s them hollow tips as they coming
Pull up, I skirt in the Audi
Hit 200 on the highway
Skip going crazy in Mazzie
Driving like a nigga caught a body
Next day pull up in the Rari
Versace my belt like Ed-Hardy's
I’m selling them burgers like Hardee's
My white boy he told me I'm gnarly
You might also like
It's a knock at my front door
12 kickin' in my front door
Now we running out the back door
Drop the pistol, this the life of that bando
It's a knock at my front door
12 kickin' in my front door
Now we running out the back door
Drop the pistol, this the life of that bando

Man fuck, my mama hit my phone
12 in my home, they won’t leave me alone
Might flush that work
Skip 'bout to dip, he running with a zip
It’s 100 on 'em, made a quick trip
Make a U-Turn, get outta here
Too-too many snakes in the grass, man somebody telling
Here go 10 bands skip, get his cerebellum
What you mean hand you the pistol? Here the Mac-11
It's six o'clock right now, I want the nigga dead at 7
Got off the phone with Gucci, he told us we on the news
We all over the channels, 4, 5, 11, and 2
He said, "Be safe lil' bruh, just hit me when you need some money"
We taking G-4 private plane, we 'bout to leave the country
It's a knock at my front door
12 kickin' in my front door
Now we running out the back door
Drop the pistol, this the life of that bando
It's a knock at my front door
12 kickin' in my front door
Now we running out the back door
Drop the pistol, this the life of that bando7Embed
