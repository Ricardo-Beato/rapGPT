13 ContributorsFishing Blues Lyrics
I realize that we ain't the same
But you might appreciate it if I try to explain
While I'm sitting in the middle of a lake
Gotta find a fish to come and nibble on the bait
I'mma set the stage for the challenge
I'mma meditate just for practice
I'mma concentrate on my balance
I'mma contemplate on this canvas
I'm a bandit running with a stolen moment
The careful arrow, narrow focus
Gotta roll with both eyes open
Quality of life feels like I'm floatin'
Trying to make this minute stretch
'Cause what's in my face is so picturesque
I mean, it even made me quit the cigarettes
I mean, shit I guess I got a fish to catch

Just like an answered calling
When I drop this line in the water
Keep fishing, man with a vision
Look brother I saw the future
You might also likeLook past I'll draw it for you
Strong words of an old soul
"Don't rock my boat," I told them
"Reel em' in throw em' back slow"

Everything looks clear in hindsight
If you can adjust to the twilight
Tryin' to live enough life to last a lifetime
Roll with the ride like I'm supposed to survive
How you know that you alive?
If you ain't fighting for a mouthful of future?
This ain't business as usual, check the tackle
Box full of beautiful, look like shrapnel
Break the cycle and the old mistakes
But the boat obeys the waves
And then the little fish spoke as it broke away
It said, "Know limits, but know with a 'K'"
Yesterday's catch will cook tomorrow
Right now I gotta do what I gotta
Took a time out from the human drama
Put my line in the water, now who wanna holler?
Just like an answered calling
When I drop this line in the water
Keep fishing, man with a vision
Look brother I saw the future
Look past I'll draw it for you
Strong words of an old soul
"Don't rock my boat" I told them
"Reel em' in throw em' back slow"
Just like an answered calling
When I drop this line in the water
Keep fishing, man with a vision
Look brother I saw the future
Look past I'll draw it for you
Strong words of an old soul
"Don't rock my boat" I told them
"Reel em' in throw em' back slow"2Embed
