Good evening
And for my last hit, I'd like to take you back to the classics
B.I.G. style of course
Uh

Playa (Hater)
Turn your head 'round (Turn your head 'round)
Lay on the ground, you've been robbed
Wake up (Wake up)
Open the door (Open the door)
Lay on the floor, you've been robbed, uhh

You know, we need this money
And you, yes baby, you, should just roll with me
Let's go off, together
On this robbin' spree, we'll make money, uhh

Playa (Hater)
Turn your head 'round (Turn your head 'round)
Take off that crown, you've been robbed
Wake up (Wake up)
Open the door (Open the door)
Don't cry no more, you've been robbed
You might also like
You see, there are two kinds of people in the world today
We have the playas, and we have the playa haters
Please don't hate me because I'm beautiful baby

Hear what they talk about me
But my crew so deep
You can't do a damn thing, to me

Playa (Hater)
Open the door (Open the door)
Lay on the floor, you've been robbed
Wake up (Wake up)
(Wake your ass up)
Take off your jewels (Take off your jewels)
You fuckin fools, you've been robbed, uhh
This is a robbery, nigga

Playa playa (Hater)
Playa playa (Hater)
Playa playa (Hater)
Playa playa (Hater)
Playa hater (Hater)
Playa hater (Hater)
Playa hater (Hater)
Uhh, thank you, thank you very much *Applause*

Thank you thank you far too kind, far too kind
Thank you, thank you very much

Playa hater

Thank you, thank you very much, good night!
